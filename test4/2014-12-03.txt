Chicago-based companies get in on the business of online giving0
“It’s an ‘and’ world, not an ‘or’ world,” Coleman said. “Some people prefer email (requests from charities to donors). Others prefer a phone call or a letter.”
Coleman emphasized that platforms like his give users access to their “donor portal” when it’s convenient to them.
“People are doing a lot of activity when they have a few moments to relax,” he said.
Steve MacLaughlin, director of product management for Blackbaud, a South Carolina-based fundraising consultant, said online giving remains a small percentage of overall donations — about 10 percent — but that it’s growing quickly. Charitable giving over the last 12 months was up by about 4 percent, but online grew at almost 13 percent, he said. MacLaughlin attributed the surge primarily to the growing use of mobile devices.
MacLaughlin said he sees online charitable giving growth as more evolutionary than revolutionary, meaning successful companies take proven ideas and make them work better with technology.
Jason Franklin, executive director of Bolder Giving, who also teaches philanthropy at New York University, said the broad array of online communications channels presents a challenge to fundraisers. He spoke from the perspective of a charity, saying: “The challenge is: How do I share the right information and tell my story and generate excitement, when you hear from me so much more often?”

Turing Biographer On The True Story Of Genius s Tragic DeathAlan Turing's Biographer On The Truth About The Troubled Genius And His Tragic Death

Andrew Hodges, author of the Alan Turing biography on which The Imitation Game was based
Sixty years after his tragic death, the brilliant English mathematician Alan Turing (1912-1954) has come back to life, if only virtually, in the new movie The Imitation Game .
The movie spotlights Turing's work as a codebreaker during World War II. That's a logical choice given his success in cracking a key German naval code known as Enigma.
The feat, which is believed to have shortened the war by at least two years and saved millions of lives, led Winston Churchill to say that Turing had made the single biggest contribution to the Allied victory over the Nazis.
But if cracking Enigma was Turing's most tangible achievement, his greatest scientific legacy is his earlier theoretical work in the field now known as computer science. So says Andrew Hodges (pictured above), the author of "Alan Turing: The Enigma," the newly republished 1983 Turing biography on which The Imitation Game was based.
"The thing that really singles him out is his theoretical work in the 1930s, published at the end of 1936 [in his famous paper On Computable Numbers ], in which he brought up this idea of the universal Turing machine," Hodges says in a recent interview with The Huffington Post's senior science editor, David Freeman (podcast link above). "And he said, rather tantalizingly, we can now invent a machine...and that really is the generalized idea of the computer as we now know it."
(Story continues below image.)

Ultimately, the computer visionary and cryptanalyst--who was gay--broke not only the Enigma code but also the legal code of post-war England, which criminalized sexual contact between men. Turing was convicted of gross indecency in 1952. Two years later, in the aftermath of harrowing estrogen treatments intended to curb his sexual impulses, he died of cyanide poisoning.
Some have argued that the poisoning was accidental . But Hodges said it was a suicide he had carefully planned to minimize the emotional pain felt by his survivors.
"He'd been using cyanide in this home chemistry experiment," Hodges, a mathematician at the Wadham College, Oxford University, says in the interview. "And I have no doubt at all that this experiment was there as a cover which allowed people, especially his mother, to believe that it was an accident."
Turing received a posthumous royal pardon on Dec. 24, 2013.

Rupert Murdoch Pretty Sure All Egyptians Are Whitereddit
Rupert Murdoch took to Twitter Friday to defend the casting of white actors in the upcoming Ridley Scott film "Exodus: Gods and Kings," which stars Christian Bale as Moses and is set in Egypt.
"Moses film attacked on Twitter for all white cast," tweeted Murdoch , who, through 21st Century Fox, will distribute the film. "Since when are Egyptians not white? All I know are.”
Following an onslaught of backlash on Twitter , Murdoch continued to dig himself even deeper:
Everybody-attacks last tweet. Of course Egyptians are Middle Eastern, but far from black. They treated blacks as slaves.

New possibilities in Bahujan politics

FOR INCLUSION: "Embedded in MIM's rhetoric are Muslim claims for social justice and citizenship." Picture shows Asaduddin Owaisi campaigning in Hyderabad.
TOPICS
social issue
Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen’s Bahujan plank can change elitist intolerance towards Muslims
Poverty, stigma, exclusion, violence are terms that come up during discussions on the status of Dalits. Recently, however, these have come to better describe another community: Muslims. Exclusion from higher education, government jobs, violence and normalised social disgust affecting Indian Muslims has generated enough scholarship. The state has also recognised their exclusion.
Both the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) claim to be concerned about the welfare of Muslims as long as Muslims do not claim their rights as Muslims. Both parties prefer them to be docile recipients of their concern — even the Narendra Modi government may not stop the subsidy for Haj. However, they expect Muslims to not take pride in their Muslimness, or link their citizenship claims to Muslimness, even as Hindus have done so. Despite there theoretically existing a ‘secular’ state since 1950, Sanskritic Hinduism has imprinted itself on the public sphere well before the Dinanath Batras and Smriti Iranis came to hold the reins — in police stations and government offices Hindu symbols have dominated; a statue of Manu adorns the forefront of the Jaipur High Court; new trains are flagged off with the breaking of coconuts; Brahmin priests perform bhumi pujas at almost every public-funded construction. Why, for the success of the recent Mars mission, even the ISRO chief K. Radhakrishnan sought the blessings of the Lord of Tirupati.
Muslim assertion
It is in this context that we need to see the rise of Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) under Asaduddin Owaisi, Member of Parliament, outside of the party’s home turf in Telangana. The party fielded 24 candidates, including three Dalits, in the recent Maharashtra Assembly elections. Though many of them were debutants, two of them won, three finished as runners-up, and eight candidates took the third place. In some places, even the losing candidates fared better than the Nationalist Congress Party/Congress contestants, with MIM polling over half a million votes. The stated purpose of MIM, to serve Muslim interests with an assertive Muslim identity, is being seen as reactionary, or more precisely anti-Hindu. It seems so to most commentators, reporters and ‘secularists’ of even the Left. Was MIM’s success in Maharashtra, which it hopes to soon replicate in Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and West Bengal, based only on anti-Hindu rhetoric?
Given the resurgence of Hindutva, Mr. Owaisi and MIM may not be anti-Hindu but they surely perform pro-Muslimness best, by underscoring the need for Muslims to vote and elect their true representative through MIM. Mr. Owaisi speaks of education, poverty, and the arrests facing Muslims, and of the need for them to claim their citizenship dues under the rubric of the Constitution. For the secularists who suggest we think of all the poor as one class, MIM appears to mirror the BJP on a smaller scale with Muslims in control. Not quite though. MIM could well steal the Bahujan Samaj Party’s thunder, what with Mr. Owaisi almost talking the ‘Bahujan’ language of Kanshi Ram of 1990s during the post-Babri, post-Mandal phase. After tasting success in Maharashtra, Mr. Owaisi was reported saying, “We have succeeded in creating a platform for the unity of Muslims and Dalits and Other Backward Classes across the nation to raise their voices against the injustice they have been facing from the so-called secular parties.”
“MIM could well steal the Bahujan Samaj Party’s thunder, with Asaduddin Owaisi almost talking the ‘Bahujan’ language of Kanshi Ram of 1990s”
In Maharashtra, MIM managed to coin a new and interesting slogan: ‘Jai Meem and Jai Bheem’— Meem here standing for Muslim, with a pun of course on MIM. While undermining the expediency of Mayawati’s Dalit-Brahmin plank in 2007, this comes as a refreshing contrast to the Shiv Sena push in the 1980s for the coming together of Shiv Shakti and Bhim Shakti, that is of Hindus and Dalits, when the latter, in the post-Buddhist, post-Republican Party of India phase, had come to be wooed by the ascendant Shiv Sena in the State. The growth of MIM today is happening at a time when we have reports of how the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh-BJP combine and its various arms are ‘Hinduising’ the Dalits to engineer full-fledged communal violence between Hindus and Muslims.
Embedded in MIM’s rhetoric are Muslim claims for social justice and citizenship. Whenever elite Indians see social justice and citizenship claims interspersed with assertions of identity, they are quick to label such political sentiments as anti-national. However, issues of inequality and justice remain intertwined with the question of social and religious identity.
Dalits may still be facing considerable indignities, violence, exclusion and humiliation had it not been for Ambedkar’s politics of identity that created possibilities of justice and equality. If Ambedkar had not carved the space for an independent Dalit politics, outside of the Congress-Gandhi-Hindu fold in pre-independence India, Dalits would have gained none of the rights and entitlements they enjoy today.
Purposive identity politics
This is not to undermine Ambedkar’s other significant contributions towards nation-building. At the same time, we need to see his espousal of identity politics as a significant contribution to the nation-building process. After all, he saw India as “congeries of communities”; the very existence of the hierarchical caste system made this a society of teeming minorities. It is the assertion of such multiple and diverse identities, and their claims to justice, that laid the grounds for substantial political and social equality.
Ambedkar, thus, has now come to represent ideas of liberation, justice, and most importantly, hope in constitutional democracy. This calls for a purposive politics that discards assimilation and celebrates plurality of identities from the standpoint of those in the margins. However, such resistance to assimilation is generally portrayed as anti-national by the mainstream elites. When Arun Shourie wrote a full volume on Ambedkar’s ‘betrayal’ of (the Hindu) nation in his Worshipping False Gods (1997), his argument was no different from what the Congress and the ‘pro-nationalist’ press said of Ambedkar in the 1930s.
Ambedkar, however, swam against the assimilating currents that threatened to sweep away the margins. That is why he converted to Buddhism, along with over half a million followers. He administered specific vows to his followers to distinguish them from the Hindu mainstream. The making of Dalits as a political community distinct from Hindus — “a part apart” — was thus an important part of the Dalit claim to equality and citizenship.
If excessive poverty persists amongst Muslims, coupled with everyday discrimination, what is so wrong about framing Muslim identity as one of exclusion and staking claim to social justice? The MIM may well be on the path of instilling belief in the Constitution and democracy among Muslims despite their excessive deprivations. After the historical blunder of Mohammad Ali Jinnah, Muslims may have finally found their idea of Ambedkar in Barrister Owaisi — for, after all, he often spoke of the violence faced by Dalits more than candidates of other parties dared to do.
If the idea of MIM’s Muslim-led Bahujan plank swells, it has the potential of both transforming elitist intolerance towards Muslims and more importantly igniting newer possibilities in Bahujan politics.

State Department Keystone XL Contractor ERM Bribed Chinese Agency to Permit Projectreddit
Environmental Resources Management (ERM Group) , the consultancy selected by TransCanada to conduct the environmental review for Keystone XL 's northern leg on behalf of the U.S. State Department, is no stranger to scandal.
Hangzhou Bay Bridge (photo credit: Wikimedia Commons )
Accepting the bribe landed Yan Shunjun, former deputy head of the Shanghai Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, an 11-year prison sentence .
Yan "allegedly took bribes of 864,000 yuan (126,501 U.S. dollars), 20,000 U.S. dollars and 4,000 euros from seven contractors," explained Xiuhuanet . "Yan was also accused of illegally setting up a channel to speed up environmental impact assessment processes, which are essential for companies wanting to build factories."
BP, one of the companies standing to gain if Keystone XL North receives a presidential permit from the Obama administration as a major Alberta tar sands producer , was also mired in the Chinese ERM Group scandal.
"Two firms on ERM's bluechip client list, BP and Sinopec, are big investors in a petrochemical complex on the site, but the Chinese authorities apparently saw no conflict of interest in awarding the environmental evaluation to ERM," explained London's Sunday Times .
In a sense, history has repeated itself.
Hopenhagen to Paris
Back in 2009, when news arose of ERM's bribery and corruption, Chinese environmental campaigners worried the incident could portend a lack of commitment to tackling climate change in the months leading up to the United Nations climate summit in Copenhagen, Denmark.
Now, five years later, with the Lima COP20 underway and the critical UN climate summit in Paris looming, the recent climate deal signed between the U.S. and China has taken center stage.
But Keystone XL will soon be front and center once again in early 2015 in the halls of Congress and the White House.
Environmentalists fear that opening another route between Alberta and the U.S. Gulf Coast for tar sands crude would ensure the deal struck between the two carbon-emitting giants becomes a moot point, or worse .
Bribery as "Investment"
A commenter on People's Daily , the state-owned newspaper in China, wrote that bribery was merely the cost of doing business and an "investment" of sorts.
"Foreign firms have quickly learnt the philosophy of guangxi [connections]," wrote the commenter . "Their rule has become, 'When in Rome, do as the Romans do.'"
ERM, in turn, denied any wrongdoing on its end, even though it had doled out the payments landing Yan in jail to begin with.
"ERM Group had no advance warning of any of the alleged payments to the former deputy director of the Shanghai Environmental Protection Bureau," ERM declared to the Sunday Times .
"To suggest otherwise is damagingly inaccurate. We are committed to: conducting our business with integrity, applying ethical principles to our relationships with clients."
KXL, ERM: Institutionalized Corruption
In the U.S. context as it pertains to Keystone XL, ERM's conduct has been far less ham-handed than it was in China.
By procedure and by law, the company applying for the permit gets to pick and pay for the contractor conducting the environmental review on behalf of the State Department. In this case, it meant TransCanada selected ERM Group to give it a rubber stamp of approval for KXL.
In other words, the State Department has legalized a de facto form of "institutionalized corruption" for handling environmental reviews for cross-border pipelines like Keystone XL's northern leg. Sierra Club attorney Doug Hayes described it as a " built-in conflict of interest " in a 2013 Bloomberg Businessweek article.
ERM Group, with a track record of rubber-stamping ecologically hazardous projects in places ranging from central Asia to Peru to Alaska to Delaware and China, has proven itself once again a key tentacle of the " carbon web " for Keystone XL.
The question remains, though: Will the sordid episode in the city near Shanghai serve as a teachable moment as applied to the tar sands pipeline described as a " fuse to the biggest carbon bomb on the planet "?
We'll find out, and likely soon.

Customer Service and The Happiness Factorreddit
Knowledge, dedication and efficiency are the qualities you might expect to define good customer service on a corporate level. But after more than 17 years of working for Canon Information Technology Services (CITS), I've learned that the best results stem from a culture of happiness.
As the president of CITS, I am responsible for planning, managing and delivering support for the countless people in the U.S. who own Canon products. Satisfying such a large and diverse array of people is a challenge, but I've learned that the key to achieving this success is in our employees. Happy employees lead to happy customers, and that is something no organization should take for granted.
To foster your own culture of happiness, focus on these five key factors:
1. Hire happy people
When I started at CITS, having a technological background was the key for employment. But over time, positivity and a natural talent for relating to people proved to be better predictors of superior customer service. It's easier to teach an eager person technology and product features than it is to teach a non-people person to be empathetic.
2. Build happy spaces
Of course hiring positive people is not the only factor for success; a company needs to actively work to keep them happy and productive. And this starts with architecture. Outgoing people don't like to be shut in. Our support centers are surrounded by glass that lets our employees see the outside world as they work. This plays a huge factor in their day-to-day attitude.
3. Create a happy team
Customer support is too important to be delivered by temps. A team of fulltime employees who participate in extensive training fosters a strong sense of belonging to a team along with constantly acknowledging and promoting achievement.
4. Support happy goals
Team members should be offered the tools and leeway to provide superior support. CITS employees, for example, use whatever communications media work best for the customer: e-mail, chat, social media and, of course, telephone. Calls should never be given a time limit, so that the employee can continue until the customer is satisfied. And while metrics for employee performance are necessary, they should be aligned with overall customer support goals.
5. Encourage happy motivation
At CITS, peer expectations are stronger motivators of success than management expectations. Team members should help co-workers with coaching, mentoring and practical tips. The appreciation that our employees get from the customers they serve helps motivate them, too.
I've learned that there are significant operational benefits to this approach. Our turnover is substantially below industry averages, but the real benefit is most evident in the way employees learn to humanize their customers.
Take the story of a printer tech that came into my office one day. He told me, "I just got off a call with a woman in her eighties. She had never used a computer or a printer before, but she really wanted to print a document. I visualized her as my grandmother and worked with her for two hours. At the end of the call she broke down and told me the document was a brochure for her late husband's funeral. You never know what's going on in someone's life. It's important to be kind and patient."
Done right, happiness can be viral. Our team members are happiest when they make our customers happy. That generates loyalty to the Canon brand, which makes our management happy. I know the names of my team members. They give me suggestions for how we can innovate. They share reports of interactions that reinforce our sense of mission. And that makes me happy.

BS Reporter | Mumbai Dec 02, 2014 10:45 PM IST
Foreign brokerage Morgan Stanley has set Sensex target of 32,500 for December 2015, implying a return of around 14 per cent from the current levels.
The Sensex, up about 35 per cent so far in 2014, is currently trading around 28,500.
"Indian equities are benefiting from the start of a new growth cycle, a benign global environment resulting in a positive shift in terms of trade and reforms, which can lift India's potential growth rate," says Ridham Desai, managing director, Morgan Stanley India.
Another foreign brokerage Citigroup has set a similar December 2015 target for the Sensex at 33,000.

Morgan Stanley has assigned a 10% probability of the Sensex slipping to 26,007,
Growth in the US and China will have a bearing on the performance of the Indian market, says Morgan Stanley.
The brokerage has set a "base case" target of 30,333 and "bull case" target of 36,939.
The brokerage has believes base case has a 50 per cent chance "with moderate rise in US yields, stable global growth and good policy momentum."
The probability of a bull case is 40 per cent driven by "better-than-expected outcomes - most notably on policy - leading to a strong bull market, allowing for a sharp decline in domestic short rates making equities inexpensive."
Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley has assigned a 10 per cent probability of the Sensex slipping to 26,007, "premised on a tepid policy response and, more crucially, poor global conditions."

UP has 3rd highest employable population: ReportUP has 3rd highest employable population: Report
Virendra Singh Rawat | Lucknow Dec 02, 2014 09:26 PM IST
Uttar Pradesh has been ranked third for having the highest employable population in India, showed India Skills Report 2015, released jointly by Wheebox, PeopleStrong and LinkedIn.
The report, released in association with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), places Delhi on top, followed by Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Bihar, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Puducherry and Tamil Nadu. It was released last month at the sixth CII Global Summit on Skill Development 2014 in Mumbai.
The percentage of employable candidates in Uttar Pradesh stood at 48.6 per cent. City-wise, Chennai topped the chart with 70 per cent of its students scoring above 60 per cent in the employability skills test.
Other cities that scored high were Palakkad, Kolkata, Delhi, Puducherry, Lucknow, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Faridabad and Pune.
About 300,000 students had taken the Wheebox Employability Skill Test (WEST) across 29 states and seven Union territories between August and October 2014. The scores were then analysed to retrieve meaningful data and emerging trends of the employability and skills among fresh job seekers. It was the second edition of the report.
Uttar Pradesh has one of the largest number of employable candidates in the 18-25 years age group spanning male and female candidates.
The report said more than 75 per cent of the test takers in Uttar Pradesh were open for apprenticeship opportunities.
Besides, the state stood among the top five states for the popular domains of B-Tech, ITI, MCA, MBA, M.Sc, BA, BCA, B.Com, B.Sc and BBA.
The sectors for which Uttar Pradesh featured among the leading states included BPO/KPO/ITeS, manufacturing, banking/financial services and insurance, consumer goods/durables, engineering and automotive, hospitality, software/IT and telecom.

Republicans meeting on strategy to counter Obama immigration movesHouse Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) addresses reporters outside his office in the U.S. Capitol on Nov. 21. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)
This item has been updated.
Congressional Republicans are developing plans to use their funding authority to challenge President Obama’s recent executive actions on immigration.
The emerging plan is a telling example of how the new GOP majorities in the next Congress plan to govern: with anger toward president whom they believe has abused the powers of his office, but wary of their own potential for political over-reaching.
House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) shared his strategy with members Tuesday morning, but told reporters afterward that no final decisions have been made. Aides privately described a two-step process that will allow Republicans to rebuke the president and keep the government open after the current spending agreement expires next Thursday.
Aides privately described a two-step process that would begin with a bill to ban the White House from changing immigration laws, a largely symbolic effort to curb Obama's executive authority that would be quickly discarded by the Democratic-controlled Senate. The bill is being pushed by tea party conservative Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.).
The second bill would fund most of the government through the end of the fiscal year next September, but strip out parts related to immigration funding. Those agencies and programs would be funded for a briefer period, likely until the Spring, giving GOP lawmakers more time to come up with specific ways to chip away at Obama's executive actions.
Homeland Security Secretary Jeh C. Johnson has warned Republicans that incrementally funding his department and its dozens of agencies risked the nation's security and his ability to enforce current immigration laws. Johnson clashed with GOP lawmakers Tuesday over Obama's actions during a House Homeland Security Committee hearing.
The Republican-controlled House says it may vote to undo President Obama's executive actions on immigration this week. At the same time the Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson defended Obama's plans on Capitol Hill Tuesday. (AP)
Whether Congress can escape from the lame-duck session with the government funded for at least a short period is the first major test for Boehner and incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in the post-election period, forcing them to grapple with the many competing blocs in their conferences and quickly build a cross-chamber political consensus. They will also need to be on high alert as the deadline looms. If the votes are not there for their composite plan, a stopgap bill to fund the government, without the leadership's appropriations attached, may be needed to ensure a shutdown is averted.
The situation remains fluid and how Republican leaders manage to sell their plan will be under close scrutiny. The forthcoming debate will need to strike a delicate balance that assures conservatives the immigration fight is not being abandoned, while also being sensitive to possibly alienating Hispanics and immigrant communities that have welcomed Obama's changes.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has made it clear that Republicans should not expect Democratic votes for bills that only provides short-term funding for immigration programs, leaving Boehner little room for error as he counts votes.
Over the past  week, GOP leaders have been  making the case to members that the party's best chance at dismantling the president's policies would come next year, once Republicans have a grip on both  chambers. Pointing to last year's 16-day shutdown , they have argued against making GOP opposition an easy target for Democrats and cautioning against the likely internal strife that an immigration standoff this winter would cause, so soon after the party made significant gains in the midterm elections.
Boehner told reporters Tuesday that Republicans are "looking at a variety of options, both for right now and when Republicans control both houses of the Congress next year." He later added that Obama's actions were "a serious breach of our Constitution. It's a serious threat to our system of government."
Conservatives remain skeptical about whether Boehner is being aggressive enough.
Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) spoke up in the Tuesday meeting and warned his colleagues that they could be "accessories" to the president if they fund federal immigration agencies, even for a brief period into the new year, according to several members present. That is the thrust of an approach outlined by Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), the incoming budget committee chairman, which would only provide short term funding for the Homeland Security Department that will be responsible for implementing Obama's executive actions.
King told reporters that any funding for immigration makes Republicans part of the problem. "If we go forward, they're asking members to vote to fund that in the short term, and then promising that we will fight in the longer term when we have a majority in the United States Senate," he said. "I don't want that red herring to be dragged across in front of us. We have to fight."
King's argument has been echoed in the Senate by Sen Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), who has pitched his party on cutting funds for immigration programs unless the president relents and using spending bills as leverage in winning Democratic concessions.
The selection of Yoho's bill as one of the key parts of the emerging combination package of legislation is a signal from Boehner to the House's conservative members that he is looking to one of their own as he plots his immigration gambit. Even though Boehner faces no serious challenge for the gavel, he is aware of the need to keep conservatives on his side on immigration, or else risk another revolt among grassroots activists.
Yoho, who has talked up impeachment more than almost any other House Republican, voted against Boehner in the speaker election two years ago. Yoho said Tuesday that he was convinced that Boehner's decision to bring him into the mix was not a symbolic gesture designed to reassure conservatives.
"I don't think so," Yoho told reporters. "[Boehner] said this was a good bill and they're going to bring it up."
Potential Republican presidential candidates, concerned about the political consequences of another showdown between the White House and Capitol Hill, are keeping close watch and asking their congressional brethren to move forward prudently.
At a  luncheon Monday on Capitol Hill, former Florida governor Jeb Bush told a group of GOP officials and donors, including McConnell and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.), that the party should avoid a standoff.
Instead, Bush said in brief remarks, Republicans should pass a series of "sensible" immigration bills next year to underscore their commitment to governing and reforming the immigration system.
Bush also argued that this post-election moment was an ideal setting for Republicans to better promote their ideas on energy, education, and the economy and said he hoped those issues would not be overshadowed.
"It was a mature pitch," said Bush ally Dan Meyer, a former legislative affairs adviser in the George W. Bush White House. "He was serious about the importance of leading responsibly."
Speaking earlier at the lunch, McConnell said Republicans must pursue an aggressive agenda in the coming months without becoming mired by intra-party clashes over strategy. While highly critical of the president, he did not call for a fiscal battle to be mounted during the lame-duck session.
"McConnell stood up and addressed the challenges that he and the Republicans have going forward. He told us about the need to manage expectations that come with winning power," said John Pohanka, an automobile dealer and GOP donor.
The meeting at the National Republican Senatorial Committee's headquarters was a fundraiser for Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), who is campaigning against Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) in a runoff scheduled for Saturday.
Separately, Heritage Action CEO Mike Needham warned that conservative activists -- and especially "our 10,000 sentinels" who follow Congress closely -- would rally to defund immigration programs in the coming days, shrugging off the advice coming from the party's establishment.
"We will ask Republicans to propose a limiting amendment that would cut any fees or funds for the president's unlawful amnesty," Needham said in an interview  Monday. "If they put that onto an omnibus bill as a rider, it could be something we support. But we expect Republicans to use the power of the purse to make sure the president's actions are not enforced or funded."
Beyond the spending bill, a flurry of unresolved issues remain for Congress with less than two full weeks left on the calendar. House leaders have said that their target adjournment date is  Dec. 12. Outgoing Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) has warned that he might keep his chamber open the week before Christmas in order to complete unfinished business.

The Paid Vacation Route to Full Employmentreddit
The economics profession has hit a roadblock in terms of being able to design policies that can help the economy. On the one hand we have many prominent economists, like Paul Krugman and Larry Summers, who say the problem is that we don't have enough demand to get us back to full employment. There is a simple remedy in this story; get the government to spend more money on items like infrastructure, education, and clean energy.
This is a simple story, but politically it is a non-starter. Few Democrats are prepared to push for anything more than nickels and dimes in terms of increased spending, nothing close to magnitudes that would be needed. As far as the Republicans in Congress, it would be easier to convert the Islamic State folks to Christianity. (We could also boost demand by lowering the dollar and thereby reducing the trade deficit, but economists don't talk about that one.)
The other side of the professional divide in economics doesn't have much to offer on full employment because they say we are already there. The argument goes that people have dropped out of the labor force because they would rather not work at the wage their skills command in the market. In this story, we may want to find ways to educate or train people so they have more skills, but unemployment is not really a problem in today's economy.
The notion that seven million people (the drop in population adjusted employment since the start of the recession) just decided they don't feel like working, doesn't pass the laugh test outside of economic departments and corporate boardrooms. This leaves us stuck with a policy prescription -- more stimulus -- that has zero political prospect any time in the foreseeable future.
There is an alternative. If we can't take steps to increase the demand for labor, we can go the other way and try to reduce the supply. Specifically, we can try to increase the number of people employed by reducing the average number of hours worked.
That should not sound far out. This is exactly the route taken by Germany, a country often held up as one of the few economic success stories in the world today.
Contrary to what is often claimed, Germany has not had booming growth. In fact, its growth since the beginning of the recession has been somewhat slower than growth in the United States.
Nonetheless, its unemployment rate is 5.0 percent . And unlike the United States, its low unemployment rate is not due to people leaving the labor force. The percentage of the population employed in Germany rose by 4.4 percentage points from the pre-recession level. By contrast, it fell by 3.6 percentage points in the United States.  If the United States had seen the same increase in the percentage of the population working as Germany, another 20 million people would have jobs right now.
The secret to Germany's success is in large part that it has been better able to distribute the available work. According to the OECD , the average length of the work year in Germany is 1388 hours. That is 400 hours less than 1788 hours for an average worker in the United States.
Germany has a variety of policies to spread the work. The simplest one is its work sharing program. The government encourages employers to reduce work hours rather than lay off workers in response to a falloff in demand. The government makes up most of the lost pay for workers who have a reduction in hours.
This is a straight win-win situation for everyone involved. The government would have paid unemployment benefits to workers who lose their jobs. Instead it is making up a portion of the lost pay for workers putting in fewer hours.
Germany has long mandated paid family leave, paid sick days, and several weeks of paid vacation every year. All of these policies have the effect of shortening the average hours workers put in on the job each year. By contrast, the policy of having benefits like pensions and health care insurance provided by  employers had the effect of lengthening hours, since it means there are high overhead cost per worker.
Much can be gained by following the German path. Twenty seven states have already followed Germany and included work sharing as part of their state's unemployment compensation system. We just need to educate employers so that more will take advantage of the system.
Several state and local governments have also taken the lead in mandating paid family leave and/or paid sick days for workers. These policies are needed first and foremost to accommodate the family responsibilities of workers, but they also have the benefit of redistributing the work. More states are almost certain to follow the lead of a list that already includes California and New Jersey on family leave and Connecticut on paid sick leave.
The best aspect of the sharing the work route is that state and local governments can take the initiative to improve both the work environment and employment prospects for their workers. They don't have to wait for action from Washington. That's a good thing, since those waiting for Washington to take steps to bring the economy back to full employment are likely to be waiting a long time.

If the U.S. military is expanding in Iraq  why isnt it embedding journalistsBy Dan Lamothe December 2 Follow @danlamothe

The U.S. military will have more than 3,000 troops in Iraq sometime soon, part of an increase  aimed at training up to 45,000 Iraqi soldiers to defend against Islamic State militants. But at least one major element of the Pentagon’s involvement in Iraq is missing so far now: embedded independent journalists.
The modern media embed program in Iraq began in 2003 , with 692 journalists embedding during the U.S. invasion of the country that March and the subsequent fall of Baghdad, according to a September 2004 assessment produced for the Defense Department by the Institute of Defense Analyses. The program’s early goals were to dominate media coverage of the war, counter third-party “disinformation” and to nurture U.S. and international support, the report said.
Thousands of journalists have embedded with U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan since. For civilian journalists like me, the assignments provide immersive learning in the dangers that Americans and civilians alike face in war zones, the complexity of military operations and the proud, complicated culture of the service members who carry them out. Embedding can be scary at times, but it also can lead to powerful journalism that explores how a military campaign is going and what the troops prosecuting it think and feel.
In Iraq, media embeds ended when the United States pulled virtually all of its remaining troops out in December 2011. They have not been reestablished, six months after President Obama sent several hundred military advisers to Iraq in June and four months after the United States began launching airstrikes against militants there. Virtually nothing has been heard from rank-and-file troops in Iraq in that time frame.
The small number of U.S. troops in Iraq now is far smaller than what deployed during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and makes it impossible for the military to embed reporters, said Army Maj. Curt Kellogg, a spokesman with U.S. Central Command.
“Given these small numbers of U.S. troops, there is currently no capacity to host embeds in Iraq,” he said. “As Operation Inherent Resolve progresses, we will continue to examine ways to best facilitate media coverage.”
A change could be coming, though. Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said that after the military sets up a new headquarters commanded by Army Lt. Gen. James Terry in coming months to oversee operations in Iraq, media access could improve and accommodate short visits to interview the troops and see what is happening. It’s unlikely that a full embed program will be set up, Kirby said, but it would still be an attempt to provide more disclosure.
“We recognize that this is something that we need to improve upon,” Kirby said.  “It truly does come down to infrastructure,” he added, referring to the helicopters, vehicles and other resources that reporters use alongside the troops in theater.
Kirby said senior Pentagon leaders have discussed “literally from when this first started” in Iraq how to get media access, but there are several challenges to doing so, in addition to the relatively small number of troops deployed.
When the United States included media in its invasion of Iraq in 2003, it was not concerned about diplomatic sensitivities. The U.S. military is there now at the request of the Iraqi government, and officials in Baghdad would have a say in any program adopted, Kirby said.
“It’s still the Iraqis’ war. It’s not the Americans’ war,” Kirby said. “We have Iraqi partners that get a vote here.”
Outside of airstrikes and occasional humanitarian airdrops, the current mission also is “much more discrete” than counterinsurgency, which requires frequent patrolling and tens of thousands of troops providing security while living on small bases among local civilians, the admiral said.
Kirby rejects criticism that the Pentagon is trying to hide what is occurring in Iraq. Not only has the military conducted regular media briefings and released regular updates detailing airstrikes, it has taken journalists on Navy ships and hosted media in Tampa, home to Central Command, he said.
Another senior public affairs officer at the Pentagon, Marine Col. David Lapan, told a room of journalists at the Military and Reporters and Editors conference in October in Washington that while the Pentagon chose to embed media during the Iraq War, they did not believe it would be the best bet to coordinate media coverage in all future conflicts.
The Pentagon has a history of embedded journalists in conflicts with small numbers of U.S. troops, however, including during the initial invasion of Afghanistan. The Institute for Defense Analyses report notes that media were not allowed to accompany Special Operations units involved in the opening salvos of that war in fall 2001, but a handful of reporters were on helicopters with Marines as they flew into Kandahar province from Navy ships in December 2001 and established Camp Rhino. Media embeds became more common in Afghanistan by February 2002.
The military also embedded media during military operations in Bosnia in 1995, with reporters joining units in Germany and spending weeks with them in the field, the report says. It was less common in 1999, when the United States was involved in a military campaign in Kosovo that was conducted primarily by air.
The U.S.-led coalition force in Afghanistan continues to take media embeds, even as American military involvement there wanes. U.S. military officials in Afghanistan warn on their Web site that embeds longer than 24 hours outside of Kabul will not be permitted unless requested and approved by a top coalition commander. But they still occur, with Drew Brooks, a reporter with the Fayetteville Observer in North Carolina, among the most recent to spend numerous days with the troops .

5 More Great Concepts for Happinessreddit
The most exciting philosophy-religion in the first and second centuries AD was Gnosticism.  In Greek gnosis means knowledge.  The Gnostics had secret knowledge that enabled them, they thought, to understand the world as it was.  Basically they believed that the world was all screwed up, and it wasn't man's fault.  The material world was a disaster.  But there was another world, the world of the spirit, that men and women belonged to.  We were strangers in a strange world, but we belonged in the light of heaven.  If we gained the right esoteric knowledge, our spirits could live for ever.
Jesus may have been a Gnostic, and Saint Paul was definitely at least half a Gnostic.  Many distinguished non-Christians philosophers were Gnostics too. I could write about Gnosticism for weeks on end, pausing only for food, sleep, exercise, and something more intimate. My next-but-one book will be about it (Gnosticism, not the intimate thing, you'll be relieved to know).  But this is not a blog about that philosophy.  Last week I outlined six concepts that can make us happy and useful.  This week we'll look at another five.
The first of these is Knowledge
More precisely, how it can make you happy and useful.  And the thing is, it is not so much gaining knowledge that does the trick, but more spreading and creating it.
We tend to think of knowledge as something rather technical and compartmentalized.  Knowledge is what universities and professors do.  Oh, and companies as well if they have scientists beavering away in their basements.  Knowledge is worthy.  Knowledge is boring.  Knowledge is someone else's concern.
Nothing could be further from the truth, and nothing is more calculated to stop us from enjoying life to the full.  Knowledge is not what they do.  Knowledge is what you do.  Knowledge defines what it means to be human.  Knowledge is what makes us beautiful like diamonds in the sky (not to coin a phrase).
What does knowledge mean?  It means making sense of the universe for ourselves.  It means advancing what it means to live.  It means being unique, and passing on more than we were handed from everyone who went before us.  We don't have to hand it on in books or videos or by being famous.  We hand it on by living.  Nobody is like me (thankfully), and nobody is like you.  You have knowledge you pass on whether you want to or not.  That knowledge is unique, because even if it comes from somebody else or from something you have heard or read, it is refracted through your experience and it carries the stamp of your authenticity.  The knowledge may be good or bad, true or false.  But it is not morally neutral.  We are knowledge refractors and generators.  The multiplier effect is enormous, through all the contacts we have in our live and the impact - unmeasured, unmeasurable, but massive - that we have.
The quality of the knowledge defines your impact and its moral effect.  There are few things more depressing than passing on dud knowledge, or persuading someone of something you know isn't true.  It may give a quick thrill, it may make you money, but it is corrosive, acidic, poison.  Those who trade in poison get poisoned.  But there are few things more satisfying than discovering something true and useful, and passing it on.
Generating and multiplying useful knowledge, knowledge that makes us happier and more useful, is the best thing anybody can do.
Finding Meaning in Life
Not everyone is lucky enough to make generating knowledge their profession.  But everyone who is happy finds meaning in what they do (whether paid or unpaid).
The psychotherapist Victor Frankl found meaning in a series of Nazi concentration camps.  For him, meaning was surviving the horror so that he could do something useful afterwards.  His view was that work was pointless unless it gave meaning to one's life.  When in the camps, he envisaged his life afterwards, he saw himself writing books and giving lectures - about meaning.  His wife and all his other extended family members did not survive the Third Reich.  Frankl did, living proof of his hypothesis.
A sense of purpose not only makes us happy and useful.  It also makes it possible for us to survive and thrive.
The Strength of Weak Links
This is one of the most wonderful concepts around.  I've written about it before, so I'll just provide a brief aide-memoire.
It was the brainchild of sociologist Mark Granovetter.  His research contrasted the effectiveness of 'strong ties' (I prefer the word 'links') - those with close friends and family - with 'weak ties' - more casual, sporadic, unplanned and casual contacts.  Which do you think helped the subjects of his research more?  Surprise - it was the weak ties, those with acquaintances rather than close friends.  And he argued that those weak links were actually more important in holding society together.
Why?  Well, our intimate circle tend to be similar to us, and to move in much the same circles.  They have access to the same information as us, and not much more.  But people whom we don't see day to day or month to month are likely to move in different circles.  They have access to information and insight that neither we nor our close contacts have.
So what?  If you just concentrate your social life and your access to information on your close friends and family, and if you have few contacts with people in other worlds, the quality of your information and attitudes will become very narrow and restricted.  If everyone just moved in their own comfortable circles, it would be very hard for information to circulate between those groups.  Society would consist of disparate and isolated groups, ignorant of each other, and probably quite hostile to each other too.
The way that information and insights do circulate, however, comes through the bridges between the groups, from those few people who do cultivate links with the distant parts of the social system - with people unlike themselves.  In our book Superconnnect, Greg Lockwood and I described these people as - well guess - "superconnectors".  They are the people who get information first and understand it best.
Personal Competitive Advantage
Perhaps the most pervasive and influential concept that business strategists have advanced in the past 60 years is that of "competitive advantage".  Like many great ideas, it is essentially tautological.  To succeed in business, a firm must be different or better than all its rivals.  It must have competitive advantage.  Trying to define how to gain and keep that advantage - that is the work of decades, if the company lasts that long.  It is a simple, elastic, and incredibly deep concept.
Michael Porter had the bright idea of extending that idea to nations.  Each country should have its own competitive advantage.  It should specialize.  David Ricardo meets Bruce Henderson.  Brilliant stuff, that still governments have not taken on board, and should.
But what about personal competitive advantage?  Maybe I should write a book about it and try to make the phrase my own.  Except I'm not sure there is much to say about it.  But then I thought that about the 80/20 principle.
So what is personal competitive advantage?  It's pretty obvious.  It is what you can do better than anybody else, or what only you can do.
Artists have it.  Successful writers have it.  So too successful politicians (not many of those), actors have it, architects have it, sports stars have it, and so on.  It is not just technical excellence.  It is skill plus personality plus attitude.  John McEnroe understood that.  He really was serious.
Do you have it?
The 80/20 Principle
If you follow me, I don't have to say anything much about this.  In any sphere, very little matters much.  But that little matters the earth.  Find out what that small portion of reality is, and use it to the extreme.
Seriously, though, put a big sign on your desk or your dashboard or the entrance to your home.  "Not much matters much, but that little matters enormously.  Find it.  Nurture it.  Spread it."
Think about the Principle every day.
Action Implications
1. Revere knowledge.  Define the type of knowledge you will originate and spread.  Do it.
2. If your work does not provide meaning, resign.  Find a job that does.
3. Have a meeting every week - breakfast, lunch, a cup of coffee, or drinks - with somebody you like but don't see very often, who moves in a different world from you.  Shoot the breeze.  No agenda.  Say what you are doing.  Ask them the same.  Most of the time it will just be a pleasant meeting.  One time in fifty, a hundred, it will change your life.
4. Define your personal competitive advantage.  Hone it.
5. In any sphere that matters to you, find the small thing that is the key to everything.

U.S. Congress
U.S. chief executive officers are more pessimistic about their spending plans and the outlook for the economy, but are more bullish on their hiring prospects, according to a quarterly survey from the Business Roundtable released on Tuesday.
Of the 129 CEOs who responded to the survey, 36 percent said they expected to increase their capital spending in the next six months, down from 39 percent in the third quarter and an eight-point drop from 44 percent in the second quarter.

The Business Roundtable CEO Economic Outlook Index – a composite index of CEO expectations for the next six months of sales, capital spending and employment – dropped slightly to 85.1 from 86.4 in the third quarter. The index is above the long-term average of 80.3, but more than 10 points below the second quarter when it stood at 95.4.
"The economy ended the year essentially where it started – performing below its potential," Randall Stephenson, chairman of Business Roundtable and chief executive officer of AT&T Inc , said in a release accompanying the survey results.
Stephenson added that the U.S. Congress needs to extend a series of temporary tax breaks, including credits related to research and development, plus approve a trade promotion authority "to encourage additional business investment in the United States to help the economy grow and create more jobs."
In the survey, 74 percent of respondents said they expected sales to increase in the next six months, a slight increase from 73 percent in the previous quarter.
But 40 percent said they expected to hire more people over the next half year. That is up from 34 percent in the last quarter but still below the 43 percent of respondents who said in the second quarter that they expected their work forces to grow.
Every year in the fourth quarter the survey asks CEOs what their top cost pressures are. This year, 39 percent of CEOs said regulatory costs were the top cost pressure facing their business over the next six months, followed by labor and healthcare costs. Regulatory costs were also the top worry for CEOs in the previous two years.

Curbing black money: Panel wants tax on cash withdrawal beyond limitI-T department
(A high level official panel…)
NEW DELHI: A government-appointed committee has suggested that fringe benefit tax (FBT) and Banking cash transaction tax (BCTT) be reintroduced to widen the direct tax base and counter black money. In its third report, submitted to finance minister Arun Jaitley, the tax administration reform commission, headed by Parthasarathi Shome, has urged the government to bring back FBT, which was scrapped in 2009 by the then finance minister Pranab Mukherjee. "This is a good temporary administrative measure for enhancing tax collection, until rising income tax collection makes it unnecessary," the panel said in its report.
FBT was introduced in 2005-06 as tax paid by employers on employee benefits that do not form part of the salary. The tax was levied on a prescribed portion of the expenditure on "fringe benefits" such as employee stock options, or Esops, entertainment, festival celebrations, gifts and running of cars and aircraft.
The panel has also favoured reintroduction of BCTT, saying there is no instrument that captures details of cash withdrawals from bank accounts, other than savings accounts. "The availability of such information would help the I-T department widen its information base on the use of black money since excessive cash withdrawal can help it understand the extent of the cash economy," the report said, adding BCTT should be reinstated as an effective administrative measure.
To cut down on cash transactions, the committee said municipalities should be encouraged to bridge the gap between the circle rate used by them for property valuation for tax imposition and the market value of properties (even allowing for a lower property tax rate) and increase the digital footprint of transactions.
"Cash economy is a major problem in the Indian economic system as large-scale transactions reportedly take place in cash, especially in land dealings and the construction sector," it said in the report. The panel also suggested that the government do away with tax amnesty schemes. "Taxpayers keep waiting for amnesty schemes to be announced and take advantage of these schemes to build their capital," the panel said.

Capitalism is officially broken: Even doggy day care workers have non-competes now( Natalie Maynor /Flickr)
R.I.P. workers. You live a reasonably decent life, roughly 2000 B.C. to this moment.
Because now that even doggy day care workers have to sign non-compete agreements, it's safe to say that management has decisively won its age-old battle with employees.
It's so absurd it almost seems like a Woody Allen-esque meditation on the limits of capitalism. But here it is: Camp Bow Wow, a dog-sitting chain, makes its workers sign non-compete agreements that bar them from plying any of the "trade secrets" they learn walking dogs at any other animal day care centers for up to two years, according to the Huffington Post . The company declined to discuss the matter with HuffPo.
This is about power, pure and simple. Companies have it, and workers don't. Not when globalization has forced more and more people to compete with low-wage workers overseas. And especially not when there are still two unemployed people, and even more discouraged folks, for every job opening. That's why employers are throwing non-compete clauses, which used to be reserved for top executives who were actually privy to sensitive info, into all their contracts: because they can.
Well, it's not just that.
Why, after all, do companies do anything? To make money, of course. So firms are using non-competes not just because they can, but because they think these will help their bottom lines too. It's pretty easy to see why. Non-competes create a Balkanized labor force where you're not a sandwich maker, but either a Jimmy John's or Subway sandwich maker . Workers, in other words, are being forced to pledge fealty to companies that can still fire them at will. The payoff, of course, is that workers who, practically-speaking, can't switch jobs are workers who can't ask for raises. Not that companies really need any more leverage than they already have when middle-class incomes have been flat for 15 years now .
Corporate America's victory is the economy's loss. Job-switching, which has already been declining, is how people find out what they really want and can be paid the most to do. And that increases worker pay and productivity , which is good for everyone—well, except maybe for CEOs. That's why these kind of quasi-feudal non-competes should be illegal for everyone other than senior executives who really do know trade secrets without the scare quotes. They serve no purpose other than to keep wages down in an unfair way.
Somehow, I think doggy day care companies will survive if they have to—gasp!—compete over the best, or at least willing, dog walkers.

Facebook is built for storytelling. Should the law blame people who use it to tell storiesBy Nancy Scola December 2 Follow @nancyscola
Jeff Dion, director of the National Crime Victim Bar Association, speaks with reporters outside the Supreme Court on Monday after arguments in the case of Anthony Elonis, who was convicted in 2010 of threatening his wife via social media. (Reuters/Jonathan Ernst)
Facebook, explained a company engineer on a visit to The Washington Post this week, calls nearly everything users do on the site a "story." The little input box that users type into might be labeled Update Status. But what pops out of it in a stream of well-designed little information boxes on the Facebook home page -- a grandmother's political musings, a link to an article on a mainstream news site, a six-second video of your holiday beach trip, whatever -- are referred to inside the company as stories.
In public, another Facebook staffer explained, Facebook for years called them simply posts. But they've switched the language they use in the outside world to match their own internal jargon. Why? Because Facebook users have taken to thinking of themselves as producers of "stories," too.
How exactly the forum that is Facebook -- where we can be our most dramatic, most colorful, most outraged selves -- should be thought of under the law is something the Supreme Court has had to contend with this week. On Monday, the court heard the free speech case of Anthony Elonis , a Pennsylvania amusement park worker. Elonis was in the habit of threatening his estranged wife and others in often lyrical yet quite violent Facebook posts. In one, he encouraged his son to dress for Halloween as "matricide." For all this, a lower court sentenced Elonis to nearly four years in prison.
What the nine robed justices -- average age of 68, and not one of them an admitted Facebook user -- have to decide is whether Elonis was engaged in mere First Amendment-protected storytelling and whether a reasonable person in 2014 would interpret a Facebook post that reads  "If I only knew then what I know now, I would have smothered your [expletive] with a pillow" as what the law calls a "true threat." Elonis v. the United States, though, also raises a somewhat deeper question about the nature of Facebook.
That is: Social media is geared toward performance. Should we really be surprised when people use it to perform?
On Monday, the justice to watch was Chief Justice John Roberts, who well captured the tricky issues that the court seems to be wrestling with. For a few moments, Roberts entertained the idea that, for Elonis, Facebook was nothing but an online fantasy land. Echoing Elonis's lawyer, Roberts tried out the notion that "it's a good thing that he had this outlet of the Internet so he didn't have to do it," as in, physically harm his estranged wife. That's an old idea, akin to the notion that mere angry scribblings in a diary aren't enough to signal that the scribbler means to do anyone real harm.
But Roberts spent far more time hearing out a different theory. Elonis's estranged wife has said that the Facebook incidents made her feel stalked, afraid for her life and the lives of her children. But should they have? Or should she have just seen them as an extreme version of the high-pitched spouting-off that so many of us do on Facebook?
(If you don't believe that Facebook makes many of us act a little more extreme than our regular selves, recall what your News Feed looked like on the day after Election Day.)
Elonis isn't alone in getting into trouble for his Facebook postings. There's Justin Carter, a Texan who, at age 18, was arguing on Facebook about the video game League of Legends . Accused of being crazy, Carter responded that indeed he was. So much so that, he wrote, that "I'm going to go shoot up a school full of kids and eat their still-beating hearts." Carter was locked up for it. But Roberts played with the idea that that was a technology-ignorant overreaction (even as he himself got the technology in question a little wrong).
"So," floated Roberts, "you don't take what is on the Internet in abstract and say, 'This person wants to do something horrible.' You are familiar with the context. You are familiar with the fact that this was a couple of teenagers in a chat room playing a game, right?"
That argument pleased Elonis's attorney, who was happy to run with it. Said John P. Elwood, "I think many of the speakers who are online and many of the people who are being prosecuted now are teenagers who are essentially shooting off their mouths or making sort of ill-timed, sarcastic comments, which wind up getting them thrown in jail."
But things seemed to get especially complicated for the chief justice when thinking of the somewhat strange nature of Facebook as less of an obscure chat room and more as a sorta private, sorta public space. Does what constitutes a threat change if you have only a few Facebook friends? What if you have a few thousand? What if you have only a handful but they're a mix of people all ages, only some of whom might get the origins of the rap lyrics Elonis says he was quoting? Roberts seemed to suggest that he wasn't sure of the answer.
Justice Samuel Alito, however, provided a worst-case-scenario for what might happen if the law assumes that all of Facebook is nothing more than a stage: "Like a roadmap for threatening a spouse and getting away with it."
First Amendment scholars agree that the Elonis case isn't easy.
William McGeveran, an expert in technology and free speech who teaches at the University of Minnesota Law School, says: "The justices are fumbling with how you judge context in the space of people's News Feeds. The true threat doctrine is from spoken language. It's from mobs in the streets that are yelling. But you read an individual Facebook post from somebody, and you don't click back to see their profile page, it's shorn of context."
McGeveran points to the case of a Minnesota 17-year-old who was suspended and faced possible criminal defamation charges after tweeting, "Yes, actually," when asked by an anonymous online provocateur if he had kissed a local teacher. The Minnesota teen argues that he was just kidding, as any sensible person could see. "Clearly," says McGeveran, "we can't hold people responsible for something that everyone in the world would see as sarcastic, except for someone who had never met Twitter before."
That raises the possibility that user base matters. Should a reasonable person in the modern era be expected to be familiar with the conventions of Twitter and its 280 million active users ? Perhaps. But perhaps more so when the forum at issue is Facebook, with three times as many users around the planet.
Inarguably, social media is far enough along to have developed its own subcultures, says Geoffrey R. Stone, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School. "To the extent that people communicate differently in this forum," says Stone, "that affects what a reasonable person would expect it to mean and what a person intended it to mean."
And, in fact, suggests Stone, the fact that Elonis had any sort of audience at all on Facebook might work out better for him than had he made the threats in, say, a letter to a friend. "Facebook is arguably less likely to be a serious threat," says Stone, "because what kind of an idiot commits a crime in such a public place?"
There's a very good chance that the Supreme Court will decide Elonis v. the United States on the very narrow grounds that Elonis was, indeed, just such an idiot. His postings were exceptionally targeted and violent, and the court may decide that he meant them to read as a threat in anyone's eyes, no matter where they were posted. But it won't be the last time a court, and perhaps the Supreme Court, will have to decide what exactly the rest of us mean when we go telling stories on Facebook.

U.S. stocks gained Tuesday after declining in the previous session -- with the Dow Jones industrial average hitting a new record close.
The Dow, S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite each ended up 0.6%.
Its 103-point climb put the Dow at its new all-time closing high of 17,879.55. That's about 51 points above the prior record close, set Friday.
Monthly Markets Checkup: 6 things for December
The blue-chip Dow has now hit a closing high 32 times in 2014.
A barrel of oil as traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 1.8% in the wake of Monday's rebound, which in turn followed a huge 10% plunge Friday .
Falling oil prices this year have sent investors running out of energy stocks. But Tuesday, energy stocks were a gusher of gains for speculators, with shares from Exxon ( XOM ) to EOG Resources ( EOG ) jumping.
On Monday, the Nasdaq took a 1%-plus pounding as the price of oil pulled out of a free fall . The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 also ended down.
The nation's top CEOs trimmed their forecasts for sales and capital spending but boosted their hiring plans over the next six months, according to the Business Roundtable's fourth-quarter survey.
Newly built homes and schools boosted construction spending in October to the highest level since May. The Commerce Department says construction spending rose 1.1% in October , after having slipped 0.1% in September.
In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index gained 0.4% to close at a seven-year high Tuesday. The Wall Street Journal said it appeared to be largely due to speculation that the Bank of Japan might start buying up exchange-traded funds. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 1.2%.
European stocks ended mixed, with Britain's FTSE -- up 1.3% -- a big mover.
The Hang Seng plunged 2.6% Monday as police used pepper spray and clubs against protesters demanding democratic reforms in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.

NSEL Case: High Court Asks Mohan India to Declare AssetsFord India to Recall 20,752 EcoSport Units
Mumbai: Hearing a suit filed by National Spot Exchange Ltd, the Bombay High Court on Tuesday asked one of its defaulters, M/s Mohan India Group, and its directors to disclose all their properties within four weeks.
The court also said that for vacating the injunction granted earlier, the group would be required to furnish bank guarantee of the suit amount, i.e., over Rs 922 crore, to the court.
According to the suit, Mohan Group is one of the largest defaulters with a settlement obligation of over Rs 922 crore.
After failure of the repayment settlement by Mohan India Group, NSEL moved the court.
Meanwhile, in a statement, the joint managing director of NSEL Prakash Chaturvedi said, "This would not have been possible without the continuous support of Management and Promoter of NSEL who supported such a suit."
The troubled NSEL faced payment crisis of Rs 5,600 crore after it defaulted payment to nearly 13,000 investors and was forced to shut operations last year.

TMC govt replaced lal salaam with scam salaam:BJPBy: Express News Service | Kolkata |
Posted: December 3, 2014 12:03 am
The BJP rally of intellectuals against the alleged involvement of TMC leaders in the multi-crore Saradha scam and cross-border terrorism, failed to attract intellectuals other than those who have already joined the party. Veteran journalist M J Akbar who had joined the party earlier this year and was appointed the spokesperson, however soun-ded optimistic: “I am sure they will join us with time,” he said on the sidelines of the event.
BJP leader Jayprakash Majumder however said, “Who is an intellectual? Were those lightmen and karate instructors who were seen in the last rally (referring to the TMC rally on November 28) intellectuals? In that regard, ours is a bigger hit as over 2,000 persons have walked this rally all the way from College Square to Esplanade.”
While it had been touted as a non-political rally and no BJP flags were sported, speakers didn’t mince words and hit out at the TMC. “This rally is for the millions of youths of Bengal who have been deprived of jobs and a respectable life. During the 34 years of CPM rule, they gave everyone a ‘lal salaam’, the TMC  government is giving us a ‘Saradha salaam’ and ‘scam salaam’. Bengal wants another change now. A real one this time,” Akbar said in his speech.
Actor Joy Banerjee said he was protesting against the attack on democracy. “Freedom of speech has been taken away from us. All who are walking today are BJP supporters and in 2016, there would be BJP coming to power in Bengal,” he said.
Kumar Sanu joins BJP
Playback singer Kumar Sanu on Tuesday joined BJP in the presence of party president Amit Shah, saying he wanted to serve the poor and claimed that a lot could be done under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership. Sanu had joined BJP in 2004 also when the party was led by Venkaiah Naidu, but later quit the party. “I am a big fan of Modi ji…Only Modi can save India and take us forward,” he said.

Full of positive energy  he truly belonged to a filmsetWritten by Amruta Lakhe |

Deepti Naval, co-star of Deven Verma in many movies, remembers the warm and effortless actor who passed away in Pune on Tuesday.
Deven Verma was one of the most endearing people in the film industry, a delightful and natural actor. He stood out in every film he acted in, including Chori Mera Kaam (1975), Chor Ke Ghar Chor (1978), Khatta Meetha (1981), Angoor (1982), and Kissi Se Na Kehna (1983).
Unki sabhi yaadien bahot hi pyaari hain. Though I worked with him in other movies as well, my strongest memories are of Angoor. No matter how long or how demanding the shoot, we never saw him tense or nervous. Full of positive energy, he truly belonged to a film set.
Haribhai (Sanjeev Kumar) and he were a riot on the sets, they had a crackling chemistry and perfect comic timing. With Gulzarji
(director), they worked very closely for Angoor. Even when we didn’t have a shoot scheduled, we would drop by to watch the trio at work. This is why even when you watch the film today, their antics crack you up.
We kept in touch regularly. A few years ago, his wife, Rupa Ganguly, contacted me. She wanted to gather his co-stars, directors and writers together and prepare something for Devenji — a sort of tribute to his life and career. There was so much we wanted to say to him, to thank him for his influence in our lives and his contribution to the film industry. I can only imagine how happy it would have made him.
Unfortunately, before we could organise something, his condition deteriorated.
On November 28, I was in Pune performing the play, Ek Mulaqat. After the show, I called Rupa and expressed my wish to drop by. She said he would have been delighted to meet me, but he was very weak. As she put him on the phone, I thought of all the things I wanted to tell him: How much we love him and miss him, and how we wished he would get well soon. I tried to string together these thoughts as much I could in a brief telephone conversation. He listened to me patiently, and said, “Haan Deepti, thank you.” I was happy that he had recognised my voice and promised to see him when he was better. I didn’t know the end was so close.
December 2, the morning he passed away, was a sad day for me and everyone who knew this wonderful and warm person. I hope with that brief phone call, he realised what he meant to us.

FireEye tattles on hackers. Investors love it.FireEye tattles on hackers. Investors love it.

FireEye (FEYE), the provider of high-end computer security services, is up more than 4% as investors seem pleased the company is tacking complicated hacking cases.
Shares of FireEye are up $1.35 to $31.63 after the company identified a hacking group that uses sophisticated techniques to steal confidential data that can then give them an edge to make a profit from illegal insider trading.
The group, called FIN4, are infiltrating personal communications and company e-mail to find out where mergers and acquisitions might be taking place. The hackers can then place trades allowing them to profit from this material and non-public information, FireEye says.
FireEye says it turned over what it’s learned about the event to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. FireEye is also believed to be working on the hacking situation at Sony Pictures, which some speculate could have political motivations following a film about Korea.
Traders are hopeful that FireEye’s recent discoveries will turn into business. Companies are increasingly sensitive to the economic losses possible from security breaches and realize that “anti-virus” software is not adequate to provide them from many such threats.

Charles Barkley is a conservative black hero. But almost everything he says is wrong.By Nia-Malika Henderson December 2 Follow @niawapo
 
CLEVELAND, OH - OCTOBER 30: (L-R) TV analysts Reggie Miller, Charles Barkley and Marv Albert speak before a game between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the New York Knicks at Quicken Loans Arena on October 30, 2014 in Cleveland, Ohio. (Photo by Jason Miller/Getty Images)
Charles Barkley has always fashioned himself as something of a contrarian. When his day job as an NBA player seemed to demand that he be more of an aspirational figure (like Michael Jordan), he steadfastly insisted that he was " not a role model ."
His schtick -- and yes, it's a schtick -- has always been dispensing with what he sees as groupthink, particularly on race, and going his own way. For the man who once floated the idea of running for governor of Alabama, this has occasionally made him into something of a conservative hero.
And with Bill Cosby effectively sidelined these days, Barkley is the new most famous black scold.
On Ferguson, he has called the looters "scumbags," condemned the media as race-obsessed, and steadfastly stood by officer Darren Wilson . Some snippets of what he said:
“We have to be really careful with the cops, man, because if it wasn’t for the cops we would be living in the wild, wild west in our neighborhoods. We can’t pick out certain incidents that don’t go our way and act like the cops are all bad. I hate when we do that. Do you know how bad some of these neighborhoods would be if it wasn't for the cops?”
"I can’t believe anything I hear on television anymore…that’s why I don’t like talking about race issues with the media anymore because they love this stuff.. we shouldn’t just jump to conclusions. The media shouldn’t do that….. They don’t jump to conclusions like that when black people kill each other,"
This is Barkley's version of being anti-politically correct and going against the grain -- though the actual substance of what he says isn't that far off from what others have said.  Nobody wants all cops to disappear from any neighborhood. They want cops who are better-trained. They also want looters punished. And while Barkley called the looters "scumbags," he also said they weren't "real black people" and pointed to the (presumably authentic) black people who tried to prevent the vandalism.
But Barkley has gone much much further than this, referring to "brainwashed blacks" who act in all sorts of self-defeating ways that hold them back.
“There are a lot of black people who are unintelligent, who don’t have success -- it’s best to knock a successful black person down if they’re intelligent, they speak well, they do well in school, and they’re successful,” he said, commenting on a story about a black quarterback who was supposedly being criticized by teammates for not being black enough .  Also : "We as black people are never going to be successful, not because of you white people, but because of other black people. When you are black, you have to deal with so much crap in your life from other black people." (It's unclear as to whether the black people he is referring to in that riff are the "real black people" or the fake ones.)
He has also said:  "There's a faction of black people ... I grew up with these guys ... when you try to do well in school, they tell you you're acting white, when you speak intelligent, their telling you you're acting white. We should have more black kids speaking correctly. We should have more black kids going to college."
A snippet of his most recent interview is below, and it's worth a listen.
While Barkley also focuses on the media's negative framing of blacks and sets up the odd idea of "good blacks" and "bad blacks," his focus on all the ways that blacks are bad has become what's he is best known for. In the world of sports, he has become something of an expert on black behavior. Amid the Adrian Peterson child-abuse revelations  earlier this year, for instance, Barkley essentially said that beating kids is a black Southern thing.
The problem with what Barkley says, though it is praised by conservatives -- both black and white -- is that he is, in the main, wrong. He seems to see black people as somehow existing outside of mainstream American behavior and culture. The "acting white," idea, also trumpeted at times by President Obama,  has been debunked.  It is not a black thing, it is a version of nerds vs. jocks that exists in every high school. Same thing with whipping kids with a switch, which is cross-cultural and all-American.
What's much more fascinating than Barkley's statements is that our national and political culture always seems to have a place for the black scold, along with broad and ill-informed generalities about black culture and behavior. There is no such thing as the white scold. There is no famous white commentator or politician who pontificates on white culture and what whites should be doing differently as a people.
Barkley said that he doesn't like to talk about race issues with the media. Ok. But what he does like to talk about is how black people behave, about how they are somehow an un-evolved compared to white people. And as it turns out, there's always a market for that.

Drivers still asking basic questions about HOT lanes complexitiesTravelers’ questions about the 95 Express Lanes , one of the biggest transportation projects on the nation, tend to fall into one of several simple categories: “How do I use them?” And, “How do I avoid using them?”
The express lanes require drivers to use E-ZPass. (Transurban image)
These were dominant themes in the questions I received during my online chat Monday . In the D.C. region, our experience with high-occupancy toll lanes goes back a mere two years , to the opening of the HOT lanes on the Capital Beltway. The 95 Express Lanes will be similar, but the operation will differ in some significant ways. The Virginia Department of Transportation and Transurban, the company that will operate the lanes, know that many potential users need to know more about the HOT lanes than about the average highway — even the average toll highway — so they’ve spent months on an education campaign in advance of the planned opening this month.
Still, many people who write to me about using the lanes remain confused about basics. Example from the mailbag:
Is my E-ZPass okay for the new lanes, or is E-ZPass Flex required? Will I be ticketed without it?
If my current pass is okay, and I am billed for use, is there a way to guesstimate how much a trip will cost? (The rate appears to range from 20 to 80 cents per mile, but no times are given for the rate periods.)
Is there ever a no-charge period, so that I can plan a low-cost, low-congestion trip?
How much does the E-ZPass Flex transponder cost?
Because the E-ZPass Flex transponder was developed for use in the Virginia HOT lanes and is heavily promoted because it allows carpoolers (HOV3) to claim a free ride in the lanes, some travelers have gotten the idea that everybody needs the Flex version of the E-ZPass to travel in these lanes.
In fact, it’s only for those who figure they will be driving in the express lanes with at least two passengers aboard, at least occasionally. It’s flexible, because it allows the driver to switch in and out of a carpool setting. The toll gantries can detect the setting, so the carpoolers get free rides.
This Flex is in the carpool setting, showing “HOV on.” (VDOT image)
If you don’t plan on carpooling in the express lanes, your regular E-ZPass — the same one you might use on the Dulles Toll Road, or the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, or the Fort McHenry Tunnel — is just fine. Don’t change a thing.
Virginia eliminated the monthly fee on E-ZPass accounts this year. But the state does want to steer those E-ZPass Flex transponders toward people who plan to carpool at least occasionally. So if you don’t use it for carpooling at least once in the first six months, your account will be subject to a one-time fee of $10.
The Flex beeps when it’s switched to the carpool setting. Make sure you hear that beep. The thing you’re most likely to be ticketed for is claiming the free ride when you’re not carpooling. Virginia state police can detect that the transponder is set for carpooling, and they can count the number of people in your vehicle. The thing they can’t tell is whether you made an honest mistake with the setting or were trying to cheat on the toll.
As with the Beltway’s 495 Express Lanes, the toll varies, and it has no upper limit. Even though we’ve had two years of experience on this with the Beltway lanes, it’s still a difficult concept for many travelers. For example, my letter-writer notes that there are no times given for rate periods. That’s because there are no rate periods. The tolls will rise or fall depending on the level of traffic, not on the time of day.
There won’t ever be a no-charge period. The charge is likely to be lowest when traveling off-peak, since the volume of traffic will be lower. But the only way to know the toll for sure is to check the signs as you approach the express lanes access points. You will pass by two before entering. Because the toll fluctuates with the level of traffic, it’s possible the second sign may show a toll slightly higher or lower than the first one. It’s the second one that counts. That’s the one that tells you what you will pay for your trip.
As opening day approaches, Transurban officials have the same expectations for use of the I-95 lanes that they had for the Beltway express lanes: Drivers aren’t going to pay the maximum toll every day. They say a more typical toll is likely to be between $6 and $8. In other words, many drivers won’t go the full 29 miles, and many won’t get on the express lanes in the first place if they’re turned off by a high toll.
Some of those trying to understand the express lanes are writing in out of fear that they will be caught in the toll lanes. When they look at a map like this one on the 95 Express Lanes Web site , they want to know how to avoid accessing the lanes.
A very frequently asked question comes from drivers who use I-95/395 in the Springfield area, near the Beltway: “I’m going just a few miles in the express lanes. Will I still have to pay a toll?”
Yes. If you pass by the signs that say, “E-ZPass Express” and the signs that display to toll rates and enter the express lanes, you are going to pay a toll. The toll will vary with your mileage, as well as with the level of traffic, but you’re going to pay some toll no matter what time of day or day of the week.

To tell you the truth , you should have entered much much earlier . Entering the market when there is panic on the street is the best way to make money . At this point , much of the opportunity is lost . That panic will come again but it take time for the next crash to come . Crashes and Bear markets are the best time for investments . Bear markets tend to give huge opportunity for SIP for long term . At this point ,Risk is  larger and if you enter now, you will be taking much more risk than it was back at 4500 , 5000 or 5500 levels on the index . Just remember this . Problem with common public is that they enter tooo late .... and they run away in bear markets and crashes which is all wrong approach . The current valuations scare me sometimes ,Stocks are up 5-10 rimes from where i used to see them but they can still go higher if growth is there .
But we have to remember that risk is always more at higher prices .

2015 Kia Soul EV outdoes compact plug-ins0
We left the Soul EV exposed after a full charge for 12 hours in freezing weather on the top of a parking garage to wind chills in the single digits and temps in the teens. It had 91 miles of range when we left; it was down to 74-mile range when we got back in. Remarkably, after two minutes of driving, the range went back up to 90 miles. All the heat generated from the butt warmers and steering wheel and climate control heated the cabin, which heats the battery in the floor. While it may be problematic to leave the Soul EV exposed in such cold with only a quarter battery left, most plug-in owners wouldn't do that anyway.
The Soul EV can be programmed to heat itself for 15 minutes before you get in, as long as it's plugged into the grid. Remote programming is available through a smartphone app.
Kia's UVO infotainment system is customized to the EV, providing a list of the nearest chargers on a real-time basis, from nearby dealerships to public chargers to Charge Point stations. We had no idea how many chargers were available to us in the Chicago area.
While the interior of the Soul EV is not nearly as striking as the Soul ! (top-of-the-line Soul Exclaim), it is in line with Kia's holistic design philosophy. Many plug-ins get higher-grade trim levels standard to support the EV premium, but instead of the exclamation point, Kia used the symbolic equivalent of recycling arrows.
Bio-based materials from corn and cane sugar comprise the interior plastics, including the headliner and carpeting, which appear to be made of the same fleecy fibers. The dash material is softly scaled, almost like a micro pebble stone. The overall grayish tone and style is unimpressive if not cheap until you understand that is serves more important considerations for the EV buyer: Kia eliminated all petroleum-based plastics where possible.
The infotainment touchscreen is clear and pleasant, though the voice commands are not.
The one place where Kia's eco-mindedness fails it is with the super low resistance rolling (SLRR) tires, which improve efficiency by more than 10 percent or 3 to 5 miles compared to LRR tires, says Steve Kosowski, the product manager for the Soul EV.
But they are brutal in even the thinnest layer of snow. Field testing turns at anything more than 10 mph made us slide around into curbs with all the grip of a teenager skitching through the suburbs; hard braking at 25 mph in a straight line meant we were skiing.
In dry conditions the tires don't hold turns, despite the 620-pound battery pack providing such great low center of gravity on the car. Anyone who gets weather would be better to swap on winter tires when the season strikes.
It remains to be seen where the Soul EV will be sold in 2015. Promises to roll it out in New York, New Jersey and Maryland and other cold-weather climes have not been confirmed.
"We will be selling the car outside California in the early quarter of 2015," says Kosowski, the product manager for the Soul EV, "but we're still evaluating where."
If it follows the track of the main Soul, as it deserves to, Kia better offer better tires.

MUMBAI: Naresh Goyal-promoted Jet Airways today began to formally discontinue its low-cost arm JetLite by rolling out full service products on all flights across its domestic network .
"Starting today, Jet Airways will offer a two-class, full service product with a complimentary dining experience onboard all domestic flights," it said in a statement.
The move is a part of a board-approved business plan announced in August to help the airline return to profitability.
The airline further said following this, it will offer connectivity on its all 51 domestic destinations with over 450 daily flights, apart from accessing its 22 international destinations and 135 destinations of its international equity partner Etihad Airways , which owns 24 percent in the carrier.
Group chief executive Cramer Ball said the move to a full service brand shows the airline's commitment to continually enhance the service and hospitality.

80:20 import curb
(Reserve Bank of India Governor…)
MUMBAI: Hinting that government may change duty structure for gold, Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan today said the 80:20 import curb was scrapped to remove distortions it was creating in the precious metal trade .
Rajan also asked investors to put their money in financial instruments and not just in gold.
About the controversial 80:20 gold import curbs, put in place in August 2013 to curb high gold inflows that was widening the current account deficit, Rajan said government decided to scrap this scheme as it was creating distortions.
Under this scheme, at least 20 per cent of the imported gold had to be mandatorily exported before bringing in new lots.
While he did not specify what these distortions were, there have been apprehensions that the controversial 80:20 scheme was leading to increased smuggling of gold and giving undue benefits to a select importing entities.
Rajan said the "government decided that it was probably the best decision at this point to scrap this rule", adding there are some requests to change the duty structure and that government will view and take a decision on it.
The then government in 2013 had increased import duty on gold 10 10 per cent.
"There were arguments that while there were distortions, they were small relative to larger effective containment of gold imports, at the same time there was an argument that any distortion is bad and we are at a point where we can end such distortions," the Governor said.
The surprise move came at a time when the industry was actually expecting more curbs on imports of gold, which is seen as an unproductive asset-attracting household savings away from the financial markets.
"The decision to scrap the 80:20 scheme is a reasonable one and let us see how it plays out. I think the fact that we have a substantial fall in crude imports means that we have some room to sustain an expansion in another import," he said at the post policy meeting with reporters.
The governor said the decision to withdraw the scheme was taken by the government and RBI involvement was just to advise it on the same as there were some debates about the 80:20 scheme and the distortion it was creating.
He asked investors to look at other financial instruments for investments rather than just looking at gold.
"Hopefully, the performance of financial assets, both fixed income and equities, will convince more and more of them to put their money in those kinds of assets in a diversified and safer way rather than in jewellery," Rajan said.

(In the survey, 74% of respondents…)
CHICAGO: US chief executive officers are more pessimistic about their spending plans and the outlook for the economy, but are more bullish on their hiring prospects, according to a quarterly survey from the Business Roundtable released on Tuesday.
Of the 129 CEOs who responded to the survey, 36 per cent said they expected to increase their capital spending in the next six months, down from 39 per cent in the third quarter and an eight-point drop from 44 per cent in the second quarter.
The Business Roundtable CEO Economic Outlook Index - a composite index of CEO expectations for the next six months of sales, capital spending and employment - dropped slightly to 85.1 from 86.4 in the third quarter. The index is above the long-term average of 80.3, but more than 10 points below the second quarter when it stood at 95.4.
CEOs said they expected 2015 US economic growth of 2.4 per cent, the same as their forecast for 2014.
"The economy ended the year essentially where it started - performing below its potential," Randall Stephenson, chairman of Business Roundtable and chief executive officer of AT&T Inc , said in a release accompanying the survey results.
Stephenson added that the US Congress needs to extend a series of temporary tax breaks, including credits related to research and development, plus approve a trade promotion authority that would encourage business investment to help the economy grow and create more jobs .
"We are constantly asking ourselves what would get the economy" on a firmer footing, Stephenson said on a conference call with reporters. "You really don't have to look further than capital spending."
In the survey, 74 per cent of respondents said they expected sales to increase in the next six months, a slight increase from 73 per cent in the previous quarter.
But 40 per cent said they expected to hire more people over the next half year, up from 34 per cent in the last quarter but still below the 43 per cent of respondents who said in the second quarter they expected to add jobs.
In the fourth quarter the survey asks CEOs what their top cost pressures are and this year 39 per cent said regulatory costs were their leading concern over the next six months, followed by labor and healthcare costs. Regulatory costs also topped the list for CEOs in the previous two years.

No peace in sight with PalestiniansBy Jennifer Rubin December 2 Follow @JRubinBlogger
The Jerusalem Post reports that “the unity government established with Fatah over the summer has ended. The unity government’s six-month term has expired, Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said at a press conference in Gaza City, adding that talks would take place regarding a future government, the Palestinian Ma’an news agency reported.” This isn’t the first time a unity government has come undone, and the unraveling is hardly a surprise given Hamas’s war against Israel in Gaza and the absence of any real cooperation in jointly overseeing the West Bank and Gaza. Hamas refuses to abandon its terrorist objectives and has found its alliance with the Palestinian Authority both politically and financially unrewarding.

“Hamas is unsatisfied with the current arrangement. They had hoped that the fig leaf of PA oversight would herald the flood of hundreds of millions in reconstruction funds,” says Jonathan Schanzer of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. “However, funds are not flowing. The international community is concerned about diversion and leakage into Hamas coffers. This has all prompted Hamas to dispense with the charade that the latest Palestinian government was forged on a common political vision.” Where does that leave us? “We are back to where we have always been: Gaza and West Bank under two separate regimes, raising long-term questions about the viability of a Palestinian state, not to mention a two-state solution.”
This also highlights the utter impotence of the Palestinian Authority and its president, Mahmoud Abbas. He can’t hold elections, for fear of losing (again) to Hamas. He clings to power, well beyond his term and unable to either reform internally or stake out ground for a peace deal with Israel.
The collapse, temporary or not, of the unity government is another blow to the credibility of Secretary of State John Kerry, who inserted himself in the Gaza war truce negotiations essentially on behalf of Hamas’s sponsors. Moreover, it is one more sign that President Obama’s grand scheme of a final peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians and a reorientation in the Middle East with Hamas’s backer Iran are part of a foolish pipe dream, which fails to take into account the motives of Iran, the nature of the radical Palestinians and the interests of both the United States and our allies. The terrorists remain terrorists and have little interest in governing, let alone in peace.
The Obama administration is fond of saying that the status quo is unsustainable. On the contrary, the status quo is very much where we will remain for the foreseeable future. As Elliott Abrams , former deputy national security adviser, has argued, “[T]he status quo between Israel and the Palestinians is likely to be sustained for the foreseeable future, for the simple reason that a full Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank is safe neither for Palestinians nor for Israelis. That being the case, the demand for a comprehensive final-status agreement is unrealistic and should not be the goal of American policy today.” Instead, he and others argue for short-term improvements in the political and economic life for Palestinians and, most important, an effort to rebuild and strengthen the alliance of non-jihadist powers in the region. (“Israel, most of the Arab states, and the United States have a strong common interest in resisting the advance both of terrorist and jihadi Sunni groups and of the Iranian-led alliance. These threaten us all. Thus, instead of pursuing policies that divide—by, for example, seeking an accommodation with Iran, or pushing for an unattainable Israeli-Palestinian peace—Americans should grasp and run with this opportunity to rebuild our relations with Middle Eastern friends while strengthening relations among themselves.”)
Until the Palestinians solve their governance issues, dispense with or tame Hamas and are ready to forget the goal of wiping out Israel (i.e. genocide of the Jewish people), there will be no significant movement between the parties. Dealing with the dual problem of Iran and the Islamic State should demand our attention.

5 once-popular cars killed off with 'final editions'

LOS ANGELES -- Mitsubishi's Lancer Evolution remains one of the hottest-performing small cars on the market, but its heat hasn't extended to sales lately.
Mitsubishi officials said last week at the Los Angeles Auto Show that they're going to kill off the little Evo after the 2015 model year. But don't fret if you want one. It's one of the models from various makers celebrating their final years with long goodbyes designed to squeeze  a few more sales from nostalgic advocates.
They are usually classed as  "final editions."
Whether it's Volkswagen saying "adios" to the Eos hardtop convertible or Mercedes-Benz offering a "so long" to the AMG SLS brute, automakers are embracing a get-'em-before-they're-gone philosophy.
It's up to buyers to decide whether a model is, indeed, going away.
Mercedes turned right and created a new near-supercar, the Mercedes-AMG GT, to fill the void being left by the AMG SLS. Mazda sold out of 25th anniversary MX-5 Miatas earlier this year, but now has shown a shapely next-generation MX-5 Miata.
But often automakers just kill vehicle names outright and create for these a last, very public bow. Models on their last legs:
•Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution. The Evo will bow out next summer after a "special action model" is offered as a swan song. "It's a great 'halo" for for the brand, says  Don Swearingen, Mitsubishi's executive vice president in the U.S., of the Evo. "but at the end of the day, we only sell about 200 a month." Mitsu will move instead to hot-performing plug-in cars.
•Volkswagen Eos. The slope-backed steel droptop was a design marvel when it was introduced, but it has lagged on its high price. To make the Final Edition a "going out of business" deal at $39,985 including destination charges, VW has pounded on extras such as 18-inch allow wheels, backup camera and heated 12-way power seats.
"The decision to name the Eos 'Final Edition' was based on a desire to recognize the model for its unique content while celebrating the value it has brought to the VW lineup over the years," says spokesman Darryll Harrison. The naming protocol "has become a little bit of a tradition with some of our models."
•Mercedes-Benz AMG SLS. The supercar with nostalgic upward-opening "gullwing" doors became a favorite of car magazines as soon as it went on sale in 2010 because of its blistering performance and heritage.
The "Final Edition" made its debut at the auto shows last year, and the final run is limited to 350 units globally. A few remain "but are basically sold out," says Mercedes spokesman Christian Bokich.
As high-impact supercars go, though, it's being looked upon as a success. "The SLS definitely has a key place in automotive history and has gracefully exited the marketplace," he says.
•Toyota FJ Cruiser. Toyota says it built 2,500 of what it called the Trail Teams Ultimate Edition Cruiser as a swan song for the distinctive off-road vehicle.
The final FJ "pays tribute to the iconic Land Cruiser FJ40 of the 1960s, from which the FJ Cruiser draws its rugged DNA, inspiration and design," Toyota says.
"We created the Ultimate Edition to give the FJ a proper send off," says Sam Butto, a Toyota spokesman.
•Cadillac CTS-V Coupe. Cadillac said it would build 500 "limited edition" CTS-V performance cars based on the last-generation CTS for a 2015 model year even though a new V-Series is on its way for 2016.
Cadillac says the outgoing model is a way of celebrating the characteristics that defined the 2010 to 2014 models -- a 556-horsepower supercharged V-8 engine, Brembo brakes and magnetic-ride control.
But it is only a "stepping stone" to the next generation, Cadillac says.

Many shoppers apparently headed for car dealers rather than the malls over the Thanksgiving weekend, driving a big finish for already strong auto industry sales in November.
Total industry sales for the month were up 4.6%, to slightly more than 1.3 million, the best since 2001. The annualized selling rate was 17.2 million, according to Autodata.
Many makers promoted extra "Black Friday" deals to take advantage of the month's holiday weekend, and loans rates remain low.
"Clever advertising from a handful of automakers planted the seed in shoppers' minds that rather than standing in Black Friday lines at retail stores to save tens of dollars, they could instead pocket hundreds and even thousands by taking advantage of deals on cars," said Jeremy Acevedo, analyst for car-shopping website Edmunds.com.
"This message seems to have resonated, particularly for GM's Buick and GMC brands that offered 20% off sticker prices for all models," Acevedo said. GM's 6.5% sales increase for the month strongly beat expectations.
Chrysler Group kicked off today's cavalcade of November auto sales reports with  a healthy 20% jump vs. the month a year ago courtesy of its star brand, Jeep.
Ford, meanwhile, reported a 1.8% decline — which it said was expected as it works to increase availability of its redesigned 2015 F-150 pickup, the redone Mustang and the new Transit commercial van.
Among the biggest foreign makers, Toyota's overall sales were up 3% from a year ago, Honda gained 4.6% and Nissan was off 3.1%, though that still was better than expected.
Company-by-company details for the industry:
GENERAL MOTORS
General Motors, lately an also-ran in the sales-increase arena, posted a healthy 6.5% increase over a year ago, selling 225,818 new cars and trucks in November, best for that month since pre-recession 2007.
"Significantly better than expected," commented Ryan Brinkman, JPMorgan auto industry investment analyst. And it was accompanied by rising transaction prices, he pointed out, suggesting higher profits.
It wasn't without a big issue, though.
Luxury brand Cadillac was a sad story — down 18.7% as the collapse of its car sales and its midsize crossover SUV were too much for the big Escalade SUV's  booming sales to outweigh.
XTS, a big sedan that was supposed to edge the brand closer to its German rivals, withered 50.3%. ATS, the small entry sedan intended to match the BMW 3 Series, was off 33.7%. And CTS, recently redesigned, was down 7.5%.
Even Cadillac's stalwart SRX midsize crossover SUV, despite buyers' renewed SUV fervor, continued its vanishing act — down 30.9%.
GM's Buick premium brand and its GMC truck brand posted the biggest increases, 27% and 22.7%, respectively, as GM was able to sell to both ends of the buying spectrum.
Buick's heroes:
Encore, a subcompact SUV, among the pioneers of upmarket small SUVs, now is reaping the fruits of its daring as urbanites rush to trim, well-furnished SUVs. Encore's sales were up 71.9%.
Lacrosse sedan jumped 70.6%. It was heavily promoted on TV with ads suggesting that Buick is a hip brand, not a fogey's ride, and with 20% discounts later in the month.
GMC benefited from buyers' return to trucks as fuel prices slide and mileage becomes less important, and by GMC's affiliation with the NFL, advertising heavily on football games.
Sierra full-size pickup sales zoomed 57% ahead of November a year ago. The redesigned Yukon full-size, traditional, truck-based SUV was up 14.5%, while the smaller Terrain SUV rose 13.4%.
At GM's cornerstone brand, Chevrolet, the Spark minicar had the biggest jump, 64.3%, but that still was just a total 2,861 vehicles.
Cruze compact sedan was a lively seller, up 25.6%, in a very competitive segment where it's had trouble sustaining momentum. Chevy's midsize Malibu, on the other hand, tumbled 16.7% despite recent updates.
Silverado full-size pickup improved 24.5%, and the big, Silverado-based Tahoe SUV rose 10.4%.
Chevrolet's midsize Colorado pickup made its debut, snagging about the same number of buyers as the Corvette sports car. GM expects that to ramp up fast, based on big numbers of dealer orders before the truck hit the market.
GM's full-size Sierra and Silverado combined outsold the Ford F-Series, selling a combined 65,343 to Ford's 59,049 as the new-design, aluminum-body F-150 still is cranking up production.
GM shares closed up 1% to $33.26 on Tuesday.
FORD MOTOR
U.S. sales were 187,000 vehicles, and the decline came despite 22% growth for the Escape compact crossover to 25,528 and a 13% gain for the Explorer to 14,949.
Ford cars were down 5% overall, with only the Police Interceptor and the all-new Mustang posting gains. Ford sold 8,728 of the new Mustangs.
The redesigned version of the big F-150 pickup, the best-selling U.S. vehicle, was just arriving at dealers in November, and its sales, mostly close-out 2014s, were down 9.9%.
The Lincoln brand posted an overall 21% jump to 8,113, led by the refreshed Navigator's 88% growth to 1,433.
Ford shares bounced up 0.8% to close at $15.90.
CHRYSLER GROUP
The unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles said it sold 170,839 new cars and trucks this November,  making it the best November since 2001. Jeep was up 27%, setting a record for the month.
The Jeep Cherokee, long-delayed replacement for the Liberty, had been on sale only a short time a year ago. This year's monthly total was 66.6% better than the previous November.
The small Jeep Patriot, long in the tooth but still popular and benefiting from buyers' return to SUVs — especially small ones — was up 47%.
The new-design Chrysler 200 sedan  zoomed 155%, pulling up the Chrysler brand overall by 29.6%.

The big Japan-based automaker, No. 3 on the U.S. sales charts, took a hit in cars but was rescued by trucks and wound up reporting 183,346 sales in November, up 3% from a year earlier.
Toyota-brand cars were off 2.7%. Lexus luxury brand car sales were down 0.7%. Toyota's youth-oriented Scion sub-brand, which sells only cars, crashed 21.7%.
Toyota's only car to sell well in the month was the Corolla compact sedan, up 13.2%. The Camry midsize sedan, despite an update for 2015, was off 5.1%.

The smaller RAV4 crossover SUV was up 8.5%.
Lexus SUVs overall were up 3.2%.
"Auto industry sales during Thanksgiving weekend were even better than expected," said Bill Fay, Toyota division group vice president and general manager. "Consumer demand for light trucks continues unabated, and Toyota dealers set November sales records for light trucks and SUVs."
AMERICAN HONDA
The company said it sold 121,814 Honda and Acura vehicles in the month, up 4.6%, as a number of models set records.
Honda's CR-V compact crossover SUV, already the best-selling SUV of any kind in the U.S., jumped 37.7% to set a November record.
The redesigned Fit subcompact hatchback also broke its November sales record, zooming 55.1%. That helped offset significant declines by the company's two core sedans, Accord midsize and Civic compact.
Acura's TLX sedan, new to the lineup, was by far the brand's best-selling car, and it helped boost the premium marque's car sales 29.5%. Acura's SUV sales, though, ran counter to the industry and fell 11.4%.

Leading truck growth was a 43.7% gain for the redone Rogue compact crossover.
Sales for the Sentra compact sedan were up 6%, but sales for the brand's volume leader, the Altima midsize sedan, were off 7.2% to 22,832.

KIA
The Hyundai corporate sibling reported sales of sales of 44,936 units, down 1%, but enough to already give the brand a third consecutive year of 500,000-plus sales and put it on pace for another U.S. record.
Volume leaders were the Optima midsize sedan at 12,707, up 16,8% and the Soul boxy car at 9,146, down 28.9%. The brand's biggest percentage gainer was its all-new Sedona minivan with sales up 578% to 3,538.

71% voting in the second phase of J&K elections but slight dip in the valleyAbid Soffi , IBNLive.com | Dec 02, 2014 at  10:11pm IST
Srinagar: Just like the first phase, voters on December 2 came out in large numbers ignoring the boycott call given by separatist leaders and cold weather conditions to exercise their franchise in 18 constituencies of Jammu and Kashmir. Several seats recorded a remarkable voter turnout, continuing the positive trend set by the first phase which recorded over 70 per cent voting.
Amid unprecedented security arrangements provided by the state police and paramilitary forces in the hinterland and Army in the forests and hills, voting was by and large peaceful with around 71 per cent of the eligible electorate coming out to press the EVM buttons in 18 Assembly constituencies, spread over five districts after a dull start due to morning chill.
Even though the voter turnout in Kulgam district and Kupwara district can be considered as high if compared to the percentage of polling recorded in other states in recent elections, the former has actually witnessed a decline of over 4 per cent while voting in the latter dipped by over 1 per cent as compared to 2008 Assembly elections. In 2008 elections, Kulgam witnessed a voter turnout of 64.70 per cent while 69.32 per cent electorate exercised their franchise to vote in Kupwara. In Kashmir valley, Kupwara tops the voter turnout as 68 per cent people exercised their democratic right in five Assembly seats followed by Kulgam with 60 per cent.
Just like the first phase, voters on December 2 came out in large numbers ignoring the boycott call given by separatist leaders and cold weather conditions to exercise their franchise in 18 constituencies of Jammu and Kashmir.
The highest votes were polled in Reasi district with 80 per cent, followed by Udhampur with 76 per cent and Poonch district with 70 per cent in Jammu region.
Meanwhile, 40 families of Kunan and Poshpora in north Kashmir district of Kupwara boycotted the elections and protested outside their polling station. The protesters demanded justice for what they allege is one of the worst cases of human rights abuse and mass gangrape of over 40 women in these two villages by the Army in February 1991.
Minor incidents of stone pelting were reported in Khudwani, Redwani and Rampur areas in Home-Shalibugh constituency in Kulgam district.
Addressing a press conference, Chief Electoral Officer Umang Narula said around 71 per cent electorate cast their vote in Tuesday's polling for the second phase of Assembly elections across 18 constituencies spread in five districts of the state.
Handwara, which is a militant prone area, recorded a voter turnout of 71 per cent, against 75.55 recorded in 2008. Even though there are 12 candidates in the fray, there is a triangular contest on cards in this constituency between National Conference's (NC's) Chowdry Mohamad Ramzan - who is seeking re-election from the constituency, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate Sofi Ghulam Mohdi-Ud-Din and separatist turned politician Sajjad Gani Lone.
Kupwara, where three militants were killed after Army foiled an infiltration bid, recorded a voter turnout of 62 per cent, against 69.32 per cent recorded in 2008. The main contest in Kupwara is between NC candidate, who is seeking re-election for the fourth time from the constituency and PDP's Mir Mohammad Fayaz.
Karnah recorded 75 per cent voter turnout, against 79.19 per cent in the last Assembly elections, while 55 per cent voters came out to press EVM button in Lolab, against 68.12 per cent in 2008.
Langat witnessed an increase in the voter turnout, against 61.33 per cent polling in 2008, 71 per cent came out to exercise their franchise.
Kulgam recorded a voter turnout of 55.44 per cent, against 61.66 per cent in 2008. Even though there are eight candidates in the fray, the main contest is between CPI (M) state general secretary Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami, who is seeking re-election for the fourth time and PDP candidate Nazir Ahmad Laway.
He said Home Shalibugh witnessed a voter turnout of 36.50 per cent, against 54.36 per cent in 2008 while Devsar recorded 60.03 per cent. The voting percentage in Devsar was 68.68 per cent in 2008. There was an increase in the voter turnout in Noorabad, against 74.11 per cent polling in 2008, 77.60 per cent people came out to vote.
The prestigious Udhampur constituency recorded a voter turnout of 79.74 per cent, against 68.05 per cent in 2008. Ten candidates are in the fray for this constituency, which will witness multi-corner contest. BJP has been hit by rebellion in the constituency, where its former leader Pawan Gupta has decided to contest as an independent candidate after he was denied ticket. Gupta will be contesting against two times NPP MLA Balwant Singh Mankotia and BJP nominee Pawan Khajuria.
He said Chenani witnessed a voter turnout of 75.48 per cent while 75.19 per cent polling was recorded in Ram Nagar in Udhampur district.
Meanwhile, 80 per cent voters exercised their franchise in Reasi constituency, against 73.55 per cent in the last Assembly elections. As many as 14 candidates are in the fray for Resi Assembly constituency, where BJP has dropped its sitting Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Baldev Raj Sharma and fielded Ajay Nanda. Sharma, who is fighting the elections as an Independent candidate is likely to cut BJP vote bank in the constituency.
Gulab Garh saw 80.73 per cent polling while Gool Arnas witnessed 80.28 per cent voter turnout in Reasi district.
He said Surankote witnessed 65 per cent polling, Mendher 72 per cent and Poonch Haveli 73.39 per cent in Poonch district.
The Chief Electoral Officer said the constituencies that went to polls today were spread over five districts for which as many as ­­­­2186 polling stations were set up, which included 143 critical ones.
Web casting was done in 178 Polling Stations and 296 digital and 216 video cameras were deployed, he added.
Narula said that 199 micro observers and 10296 poll personnel were deployed during today's polling. The CEO said 175 candidates were in the fray for these 18 constituencies which comprised 1542737 numbers of electors including 818025 male, 724703 female and 09 third gender voters.

Buying a star for a holiday gift is like throwing money into a black holeBy Blaine Friedlander December 2
Every night, the stars are yours — for free! (Marek Nikodem via NASA APOD )
We’ve survived Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Now, as we continue full throttle into the holiday gift-buying season, the advertisements to buy a star for loved ones are ramping up.
Not to put a damper on your holiday cheer, but you can’t really buy stars. Let’s be clear: registering or purchasing a star is nothing more than a novelty gift. It isn’t real.
“Some commercial enterprises purport to offer such services for a fee,” according to the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in Cambridge, Mass., the only authentic body that can name celestial objects. Commercial so-called star-naming registries have no formal or official validity , says the IAU.
When you venture onto the web, you can easily find a half dozen companies that for your $54 or $19.95 or $14.95, you may get a printed certificate – framed or unframed – with the star named for your loved one or you could receive a printable, instant certificate via email. Some packages include wallet-size certificates, too.
The International Star Registry has been “selling stars” for a long time. In 1998, New York City’s Department of Consumer Affairs issued a violation against the International Star Registry, an Illinois company, for engaging in a deceptive trade practice – facing fines of $3,500 or more according to the agency’s press release. The city’s then-consumer affairs commissioner Jules Polonetsky said that paying to name stars after loved ones is “simply throwing money into a black hole.”
“Star-naming companies fool consumers into thinking that they can ‘become’ a star by attaching their name to one,” Polonetsky said, “but in reality, the star names are nothing more than a listing in the company’s own book.”
Professional and amateur astronomers – those who study the authentic cosmos – might be surprised to learn that the Better Business Bureau (Chicago and Northern Illinois) recently gave the International Star Registry an “A+” rating . Though the company does admit: “This listing is not, nor is it intended to be … recognized by the scientific community, but it is protected by copyright law.”
In the holiday film It’s a Wonderful Life, it didn’t cost Jimmy Stewart’s George Bailey $54, plus shipping and handling, to lasso the moon for Donna Reed’s Mary Hatch . Bailey roped our lunar neighbor for free – and you can too. If you want to give starry gift to a loved one or friend, simply get creative and make your own poster or certificate or perhaps invent your own proclamation claiming a star.  Yours has all the validity as any star registry, and it will be likely more precious.
 

Why Open Leadership Has Become Essentialreddit
You would not be reading this if open-source software did not exist. Without open-source standards, the Internet would not exist. This article would not exist. Those of you whose parents met on Match.com would not exist. All of you should be thankful for open source software. Now, as the world has changed, open source software's principles of openness, transparency and meritocracy have become essential standards for leadership in general.
Mike Milinkovich of Eclipse, "a community for individuals and organizations who wish to collaborate on commercially-friendly open source software," took me through his thoughts on those principles during a conversation at the HATCH experience.
Openness
Open source software design is open "to all comers." Anyone can contribute. Everyone is invited to contribute. This is about the wisdom of crowds with each contributing in their own way.
Transparency
Complete transparency. To every line of code. To every project parameter. To every decision. The objective is for anyone coming in to be able to see what has been done before and why. This way newcomers can get onboard and contribute faster.
Meritocracy
Everyone has to earn his or her way in. Those most committed and most deserving are invited in once they have earned those invitations.
Milinkovich is convinced that the miracle of chance that the World Wide Web was originally conceived at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, is the key to its rapid expansion. CERN had a requirement that all software developed there be made freely available. Without that open source start, WWW's rapid growth would not have been possible. Instead, the web went "from a technical novelty to a basic human right in 20 years."
Application to leadership
It seems to be just common sense that the principles of open source software development should apply to leadership. Who can argue against the advantages of openness, transparency and meritocracy?
Middle managers.
Open leadership points the way to self-regulating and self-directed teams. Teams like that don't require managers who add no real value beyond span breaking. So middle managers like that argue against open leadership because it's a threat to their positions. Of course that's not the way they argue the point. They argue for risk management and the need for process and discipline. But they're really just trying to justify their own existence.
Make them go away.
Not necessarily the managers themselves. Their roles as span breakers. Find them other things to do that actually add value. Don't let the old ways get in the way of a new, better form of leadership that can enable web-like growth.
Openness
You don't really have a choice about openness. Managers used to be able to control who had seats at the table, keeping out all but the few that had the knowledge and clout required to make meaningful contributions. But now information is everywhere. Skills are distributed. The "few" no longer have a monopoly on influence. Others can help. If you don't open up and let them in, your competitors will. Success will go to the open.
Transparency
The way Millennials gather information has made this a moot point. You're already transparent. There are no secrets anymore. Anyone on your team can figure out the value of your home in under five minutes. Stop worrying about whether they might figure out your organizations deepest, darkest secret financial statements. They already have. The only choice you get is whether to pretend you have secrets and let others control the dialogue or adopt a policy of transparency so you can lead the conversations.
Meritocracy
They know. They know who's doing real work. They know who got their jobs because of "connections." They know who has earned their way in and who has not. Your choice is either to ignore this and go on the way you have or to adopt meritocracy as a core principle. The #1 thing top performers want is for someone to get the poor performers out of their way. Do that or be prepared to lose those top performers.
Net, adopting open leadership is the only viable path to success in the new world.

Private stations promisedPrivate stations can be a win-win for railways, operators
Business Standard Editorial Comment | New Delhi Dec 02, 2014 09:38 PM IST
The idea of modernising and running India's large railway stations in the public-private-partnership (PPP) mode has been dusted and taken off the shelf. The prime minister has announced that this will be done initially in around a dozen stations, with trains running below and the space above developed as commercial property. The idea of modernising railway stations under a PPP arrangement was aired several years ago by the then railway minister, Lalu Prasad, who visualised attracting Rs 15,000 crore investment in 22 stations. A beginning was made in seeking to transform New Delhi Railway Station for the Commonwealth Games in 2010. But this was a non-starter as the Planning Commission and the railways could not agree on a model concession agreement for such projects. Now, with a more powerful prime minister, Narendra Modi, at the helm and the Planning Commission out of the way, it is quite likely that prominent Indian railway stations will be put under the PPP mode.
Running railway stations or owning rolling stock like wagons and even entire trains is not the core operation of the railways, which is to maintain tracks and signalling and run trains. So it is entirely logical that the prime real estate that every station represents be leveraged to unlock capital and build valuable commercial space and business. But the more important issues are how this should be done and whether the railways in their present condition are capable of doing a good job of it. Their experience in bringing in private partners has been at best mixed. As there are no private competitors in the railway business and railway services are a utility, it is critical to get the regulatory framework right. Catering on long-distance trains, for example, has been outsourced with negative results. Quality initially jumped but thereafter declined, indicating that the railways are neither very efficient nor sufficiently free of corruption to do a good job of monitoring private delivery.
The key task before Mr Modi is to have a railways minister who can bring about a culture change in the organisation, so that it can successfully venture out into new forms of management. He has already made a false start, and the railways minister has had to be changed. In the process, a crucial six months have been lost. Hopefully the new minister, Suresh Prabhu, who comes with a reputation for both efficiency and integrity, will be able to deliver. For private development and management of railway stations to succeed, the concession agreement has to get the pricing right, so that the operator can earn a decent return without overcharging passengers and incentives to improve efficiency. It is also critical to lay down minimum standards of service and ensure that they are maintained. There should be penalty for failing to make the mark and provision to get rid of a non-performer and bring in a new partner. None of this is rocket science, but the bureaucracy in the railways has to do much to get it right.

Heres why Republicans really shouldnt want a government shutdown  in 1 chartBy Scott Clement December 2 Follow @sfcpoll
Congressional Republicans are brainstorming ways to punish President Obama for unilaterally deferring deportation for millions of illegal immigrants. But GOP leaders seem to have ruled out a partial government shutdown a la 2013, according to The Post's Robert Costa and Ed O'Keefe:
The House GOP was still considering several possible funding bills as discussions continued, the leadership's favored Hill response to Obama's immigration moves, according to senior GOP aides familiar with the process -- a strategy that would demonstrate the party's defiance while avoiding the shutdown theatrics and public disapproval that plagued it last year.
Rank-and-file Republicans would be very wise to listen to their leaders. Check out the chart below that uses  Washington Post-ABC News polls  to track disapproval of Obama and congressional Democrats and Republicans in the fall of 2013.
Disapproval of Republicans grew from 63 percent immediately before the shutdown to 70 percent during its first week and 74 percent the following week. Congressional Democrats and President Obama started off with lower negative ratings, and they increased less during that same period. By mid-October, disapproval of Republicans was 13 percentage points higher than Democrats and 21 points higher than Obama.
After the shutdown, a separate  Post-ABC poll found 53 percent saying that Republicans in Congress were mainly responsible for it, compared with 29 percent who blamed Obama. The results were almost identical to a Post-ABC poll following the 1995-96 partial government shutdown, which found the public blaming Republicans more than President Bill Clinton by a margin of 50 percent to 27 percent.
In short, Republicans should listen to House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) -- as paraphrased in the New York Times this week . "Only Republicans, he said, would be blamed for a shutdown, just as they were last year." If past is prologue, Boehner is 100 percent right.

LBA gets final touches as PM set to visitBangladeshWritten by Madhuparna Das | Kolkata |
Posted: December 3, 2014 12:05 am | Updated: December 3, 2014 1:56 pm
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to visit Bangladesh in the new year. The implementation of the Land Boundary Agreement is therefore getting final touches and is likely to be completed before the expected visit, sources in Bangladesh government said.
Meanwhile, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is scheduled to hold a rally at Nayarhat, which is surrounded by four Bangladeshi enclaves (chitmahal) in Cooch Behar district. Banerjee is expected to interact with people of the enclaves on December 4.
Banerjee and her party were up against the Land Boundary Agreement (LBA) and opposed the implementation of the pact. The protocol that was signed between the Government of India and the Government of Bangladesh in 2011, could not be ratified in Parliament. In September, 2013, UPA II regime under Manmohan Singh tried to table the Bill in Rajya Sabha, though the bill was torn off by the protesting TMC MPs.
However, on December 1, the standing committee, which is led by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor and has TMC MP Sugata Bose, recommended that the LBA should be implemented. There was a complete turn around as far as the Trinamool Congress opposition was concerned.
Explaining the reasons behind the TMC’s approval to the Bill, Renuka Sinha, MP, Cooch Behar said that Didi “could feel the pain of the people living in Indian enclaves in Bangladesh which led to the clearance on the agreement”. “Our party had some serious issues with the protocol and its clauses. If the protocol is ratified, our state would lose a huge quantum of land too and there are certain other issues. But Didi wants the agreement to be implemented as she can feel the pain of the people living in Indian enclaves in Bangladesh,” said Sinha.
“We can say that the people living in Bangladeshi enclaves in India do not face difficulties everyday, but the people living in Indian enclaves go through so many issues everyday. Didi has further decided to hold a meeting at Nayarhat on December 4 where she will directly interact with the people of chitmahal.”
Excited with the news of expected ratification of the Bill, enclave dwellers swung into a celebration mood. The residents also celebrated the birth anniversary of late Dipak Sengupta, a Forward Bloc MLA who first spearheaded the movement for the residents of enclaves. Simultaneously, they held meetings to discuss how they would interact with the CM as this would  be the first interaction between residents of chitmahal and the head of the state.
Mamata will hold the meeting at Nayarhat that is surrounded by four enclaves including Karola, Papola, Shib-prasad, Poaturkuthi and Mustai. “At least 12,000 people from chitmahal will join the meeting. For last 66 years we have remained stateless and now our children would live a life of dignity,” said Saheb Ali, a leader of the movement by the enclave dwellers.
Zokey Ahad, deputy High Commissioner of Bangladesh, said, “We are hopeful that the agreement would be continued…

US auto sales continue torrid pace in November

(GM on Tuesday said November…)
DETROIT: The top six automakers sold more cars and trucks in November than analysts expected, with a healthy economy, generous discounts and low fuel prices luring consumers into US showrooms.
The industry's annualized sales rate in November was about 17.2 million vehicles, according to industry consultant Autodata Corp. That is the best pace for that month since 2003 and well ahead of the estimated 16.7 million in a Thomson Reuters survey of 41 industry economists and analysts.
November sales totaled 1.3 million, up 4.6 per cent from a year ago and higher than analysts' expectations of 1.27 million.
"This sustained demand for new vehicles was building for years during the recession, and it should continue unless a major shift in economic stability occurs," said analyst Karl Brauer of Kelley Blue Book.
General Motors Co , Chrysler Group, Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co all reported year-to-year sales gains in November, while Ford Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co Ltd had modest declines. All six topped forecasts from analysts surveyed by Reuters.
Early buzz and promotions tied to the post-Thanksgiving "Black Friday" retail blitz helped spur car sales, according to John Krafcik, president of online shopping service TrueCar.com. Krafcik said average transaction prices on full-size pickups in November topped $40,000 for the first time.
GM on Tuesday said November sales rose 6.5 per cent to 225,818 vehicles. Sales of GM's Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra full-size pickups climbed 34 per cent to 65,343.
"Lower gasoline prices are helping the entire market, not just SUVs and trucks," said GM spokesman Jim Cain, who also cited improving consumer confidence, higher wages and lower unemployment.
Chrysler Group sales rose 20.1 per cent to 170,839 vehicles on strong showings by its Jeep utility vehicles and Ram trucks. Ram pickup sales were up 21 per cent, while Jeep SUV sales jumped 27 per cent.
Ford reported a slight decline in sales to 186,334 vehicles, about what analysts had expected. Sales of the best-selling F-150 pickup were down 10 per cent to 59,049 as the automaker began a changeover to the redesigned 2015 model.
Ford chief economist Emily Kolinski Morris said plunging fuel prices have provided a "financial windfall" for buyers, bolstered by still-low interest rates.
"By any measure, households are reaping significant disposable income gains each week at current gas prices," she said.
Toyota said sales rose 3 per cent to 183,343, while Honda reported an increase of nearly 9 per cent to 121,814. Nissan said sales were down 3 per cent to 103,188. All three companies beat analysts' expectations.

Whats safe  whats not a single brain celldecidesWritten by Mihika Basu | Mumbai |
Posted: December 3, 2014 12:46 am
Terror attacks, war, natural disasters, sexual assault, serious injuries and even bullying in adults or children can lead to anxiety disorders, known as post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD). Now, researchers from the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research’s (TIFR’s) National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS) have discovered how the brain’s ability to distinguish safe from dangerous can go badly wrong, potentially leading to a state of generalised fear. Excess generalisation of the original fearful stimulus is a key symptom of PTSD.
The breakthrough findings reveal, for the first time, that the loss of one’s ability to determine what is safe and what is dangerous can happen at the level of a single brain cell. Their findings, published in the journal, “Nature Neuroscience”, can help in designing new treatments against PTSD.
“Psychiatric disorders like PTSD is a debilitating disorder triggered by a traumatic or life-threatening experience. In addition to repeated flashbacks, patients respond with intense fear and hyperarousal, similar to that experienced during the original traumatic event, reacting to things which pose no threat. Excessive generalisation of the original fearful stimulus is a major symptom of PTSD,” said NCBS professor Sumantra Chattarji, senior author of the study.
According to the findings of the fear-conditioning experiments, done with live rats, individual neurons in the emotional hub of the brain called the amygdala, which were initially capable of telling the difference between safe from dangerous stimuli, can start firing indiscriminately, causing one to become fearful of non-threatening situations.
“Fear memories are crucial for survival, but problems arise when one loses the ability to distinguish between what’s safe and what’s dangerous and starts fearing things which he or she should not. While we have known that the amygdala, a brain structure that forms memories of fearful experiences, becomes hyperactive in PTSD, how and why this happened was not known before. Our study shows that loss of ability to distinguish between what’s safe and what’s not can happen at the level of an individual brain cell and hence, it’s a very fine balance. Further, we have identified a specific biochemical signalling mechanism inside amygdala neurons that can cause this transition to generalised fear, which could potentially serve as a target for designing new treatments against PTSD,” said Chattarji.
In the experiment, rats were exposed to two distinctly different sounds, one was paired with a mild electric shock, while the other was not.
Thus, one tone predicted danger and another was “safe”. The rats quickly learned to discriminate between the two. As the animals learned, the researchers recorded electrical signals from individual neurons. These recordings revealed that the amygdala neurons fired more electrical signals in response to the dangerous tone, thus mirroring the animal’s behaviour. The authors also noticed that a small number of neurons did not possess this ability and fired indiscriminately to both tones.
“Strikingly, when the shock associated with the continued…

DC-AC rail track conversion delayed due to new rakes  says top CRofficialWritten by Priyal Dave | Mumbai |
Posted: December 3, 2014 12:32 am
The delay in commissioning new Bombardier Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) rakes will delay Central Railway’s (CR’s) plan to convert traction from 1,500 volt direct current (DC) to 25,000 volt alternating current (AC) between Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus and Thane by December 31.
The non-availability of trains that run on alternating current (AC) rakes will affect the conversion work, said Sunil Kumar Sood, General Manager, CR, during Idea Exchange on Tuesday.
The conversion work is being undertaken to run faster trains, save energy and cut down travel time of trains by avoiding change of engines for long-distance trains as the rest of the Indian Railways is powered by AC traction.
In August this year, Sood had announced that the CR would run all its trains on AC traction from January 1, 2015.
“The conversion will not take place until we get four additional rakes. We have completed all the work. However, due to delay in arrival of Bombardier rakes, we are unable to switch over to AC current,” said Sood during the interaction.
If the conversion is undertaken immediately, CR will have to phase out nine DC rakes, which mean withdrawing around 117 daily services.
Since the railways cannot reduce the number of daily services, it has no option but to wait for the approval of the two Bombardier rakes.
Sood said that apart from the two Bombardier rakes that are already in the city, CR will need two additional rakes, which he said may be sourced from Western Railway (WR), depending on the availability of rakes.
Currently, CR uses 75 rakes on its mainline, of which nine will become unusable after conversion work.
“We have sent all the documents related to the conversion for a review by the Chief Commissioner of Railway Safety (CCRS) on December 1,” said Sood.
The administration, which is ready to test-charge the section, is now waiting for a weekend to carry out the activity. With the next two weekends unavailable for any block due to major public events, CR plans to carry out the activity on December 20. Once the test charge is carried out, the Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) will conduct an inspection before giving the railways a green signal.
Until two of the 72 12-car rakes procured under the World Bank-funded Mumbai Urban Transport Project 2A, which arrived in Mumbai last year, are commissioned, CR will have little choice but to continue with the old traction.

On cue from CM  MMRDA dusts off old plans for BKC-type business hubs incityWritten by Manasi Phadke | Mumbai |
Posted: December 3, 2014 12:22 am
With the new Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis keen on creating more business districts on the lines of the plush Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC), the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) is hoping to revive stalled proposals for such projects.
After BKC, the authority had set its sights on transforming Oshiwara and Kanjur Marg into business districts. The lack of sufficient land in MMRDA’s possession in these areas, however, halted its plans.
U P S Madan, metropolitan commissioner at MMRDA, said, “The chief minister has desired that there should be more such centres. We are hoping to revive some projects. In fact, the Oshiwara business district had been in discussion with the previous government over the past few months as to what changes we could make to the existing plan for it to be viable.”
Creating more business districts was one of the prominent points of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s election manifesto. Besides, Fadnavis, after being sworn in as the chief minister, has said on several occasions that the city needs at least 10 more BKC-like commercial districts.
The concept of a business centre in Oshiwara over a 102-hectare area was first conceived in 1992. The idea was that MMRDA would acquire land from the owners at a rupee and then lease it back to them for 60 years with a high Floor Space Index (FSI).
Madan said, “However, for several years, this didn’t succeed. Many land owners didn’t want to be constrained with our rules. There is also a lack of adequate infrastructure in the area. Many may have had doubts about how many years it would be before the government’s plans take shape. We are trying to find different ways and means of how to make this more successful.”
According to the development authority’s website, MMRDA has so far acquired and leased back 22.39 hectares, which is barely a fifth of the project area.
The Kanjur Marg project, on the other hand, was proposed in 2008, but was stuck as the state government was unable to hand over land under its ownership to MMRDA for development despite having granted an in-principle nod for the project. According to an MMRDA official, the state owns about 600 hectares from Kanjur village to the Mulund check post, of which 261 hectares is vacant. Some of it is also stuck in litigation.
“While some land is under litigation, some belongs to the government. If the government can hand it over to MMRDA, we can develop it exactly on the lines of BKC,” Madan said.
BKC was created on 370 hectares of once low-lying land on either side of the Mithi River, Vakolla Nalla and Mahim Creek. The MMRDA fixed a development plan for the region, developed continued…

Pak artistes denied nod to perform at last hour  NCPA concert calledoffWritten by Kevin Lobo | Mumbai |
Posted: December 3, 2014 12:18 am | Updated: December 3, 2014 12:19 am
Two days after their performance at NH7 Weekender in Delhi, Pakistani artiste Ustad Nafees Ahmed and his six colleagues were waiting in the green room of Tata Theatre at the National Centre for Performing Arts (NCPA) in Mumbai with his bandmates from Sachal Jazz Ensemble on Monday evening.
It was past showtime, and the musicians were getting restless, ready to go on stage in their costumes, with their instruments tuned.
At 7.30 pm, an organiser approached and informed them that due to some problem with permissions, they had been forced to cancel the concert.
“It has been an unpleasant experience,” says the sitarist, who last performed in Mumbai 15 years ago. “We were hoping that people in India would like our music, that we could make a few friends here before going home. But that has not been possible because the concert was cancelled.”
According to the Mumbai Police, it was the state home department’s discretion to not allow the Pakistani musicians, who are part of the Sachal Jazz Ensemble, to play at the NCPA. “We were asked for our remarks. There was no threat as such posed by the participation of the Pakistani musicians on Monday. However, keeping in mind incidents in the city over the last two years when it concerned Pakistani artistes, we could not completely eliminate the possibility of trouble had they performed,” said Ravindra Shisve, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Zone I.
Subsequently, the no-objection certificate (NOC) required for the Pakistani artistes to perform in the city was not provided, after which the organisers decided to cancel the concert.
Malini Hariharan, who has been coordinating the band’s India tour, says, “This is clear discrimination. There were jazz musicians from the UK who were performing with the band, and they were provided an NOC. The police even said, ‘go ahead, organise your show, but you can’t let the Pakistani musicians perform’”.
In an official statement, the NCPA said, “Whenever the venue is given for hire, seeking the required licences is the organisers’ responsibility.”
The ensemble is the product of UK-based businessman Izzat Majeed’s dream to give session musicians from Lollywood, the film industry in Pakistan, another shot at music. Under the dictatorship of Muhammad Zia ul-Haq between 1978 and 1988, Lahore’s film industry was crippled by new conservative laws, as a result of which these maestros were left with little work. Majeed went to Pakistan in 2002 and tracked down a few of these artistes. A few of them were found running chai stalls while one ran an electrical store. As part of Sachal Jazz Ensemble, these musicians play jazz standards with a classical music twist.

NO MORE CRAMMING: The Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation system which sought to bring reforms in the traditional system of evaluation which placed students under enormous stress. Picture shows a student preparing for the board exams in New Delhi. Photo: S. Subramanium
TOPICS
test/examination
The Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation system may suffer from limitations, but it is important to move away from an exam-centric approach
A few ‘toppers’ from some Delhi schools affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE)have asked the Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani to reintroduce the board examinations in Class 10. The main argument presented against the Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE) system was that it did not prepare them for competitive exams such as the Joint Entrance Examinations for Indian Institutes of Technology and pre-medical exams. The students also demanded that content in the latest National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) textbooks be increased and reoriented towards clearing such exams.
Such grievances can be understood better if a perspective which regards schools as sites which select, eliminate and celebrate the high scores of a few meritorious students, who succeed by virtue of the social-cultural capital that they possess, is believed, as opposed to a view which regards schools as inclusive, egalitarian and just learning spaces. These demands also reflect a belief which equates ‘learning’ with ‘performing well’ in exams. To understand these concerns better, it is important to examine recent educational reforms initiated in India.
The much-awaited Right to Education (RTE) Act 2009, besides making education a fundamental right for children in the age group 6-14 years, also made it mandatory that “no child admitted in a school shall be held back in any class or expelled from school till the completion of elementary education.” It also proposed “Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation of a child’s understanding of knowledge and his or her ability to apply the same” and said, “no child shall be required to pass any board examination till completion of elementary education.”
While these provisions were to be applicable to all schools in the country, the CBSE made the Class 10 board exam optional for those students who wanted to continue studying in the same school. However, all students, including those who opted for CCE, would still have a choice to take the on-demand exam. This was in keeping with the recommendation of the National Focus Group Position Paper on Examination Reforms, National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005.
Providing equal opportunities
In a country which is still struggling to universalise elementary education, the dropout rate increases while moving up the educational ladder. In view of this, the purpose behind the ‘no detention’ policy was to give all children, especially the disadvantaged, equal opportunities to complete elementary schooling.
“The aspirations of students who want class 10 board examinations to be reintroduced are very different from millions of other students who to simply want to survive in the education system”
The CCE similarly was a result of several years of deliberation and reflection. It sought to bring reforms in the traditional system of evaluation, which had a written exam at the end of the academic term, placing children under enormous stress. The nature of this exam was such that it essentially tested students’ skills to memorise and reproduce textbook content, which in most cases presented disjointed information and facts as ‘ultimate truth,’ with little relationship with children’s experiences. The CCE on the other hand proposed a school-based, teacher-conducted continuous assessment, which would extend beyond the cognitive domain, and therefore serve as a tool for diagnosis and further learning. The idea underlying CCE was to integrate assessment with teaching-learning, so that it would seamlessly be woven with pedagogic processes, both inside and outside the classrooms. This marked a significant shift from an exam-centric system which dictated not just the way students approached learning but also determined the ‘worth’ of knowledge.
Despite the child-centred focus and enthusiasm with which these reforms were introduced, they were not only received uncritically, but viewed with scepticism as well. In 2012, the Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE) constituted a subcommittee for assessment and evaluation of CCE in the context of the ‘no detention’ provision of the RTE. The committee, which was headed by former Education Minister of Haryana, Geeta Bhukkal, pointed out in its report several limitations in the implementation of these provisions, placing them in the context of declining learning levels of children and migration of children towards private schools. The committee (not unanimously though) recommended implementation of ‘no detention’ in a phased manner, and reiterated the need to link assessment of learning outcomes with promotion of students to the next class beyond Grade 5. The committee also said that ‘no detention’ was often misunderstood as ‘no assessments’ or ‘no relevance of assessment’ and therefore adversely affected the drive to perform, as the policy seemed to indicate that performance did not matter.
It is important to ascertain the location and validity of such concerns. Both the CCE and the ‘no detention’ policy were meant to address the needs of especially those learners who are either disadvantageously placed or those who get pushed out of the school system with a low self-esteem, because of the lopsided view of learning which celebrates cramming of textbooks in examinations. The projection of such issues appearing in national dailies mistakes the concerns of a bunch of high scoring students from a few elite schools from a metropolitan city as being representative of all the student voices in the country. The aspirations of such students, which is to crack the prestigious engineering and medical exams straight after school, is sharply different from millions of those aspiring to simply survive in the system. It is this view of equating ‘performance in exams’ with ‘learning’ that the NCF 2005, and before that the Yashpal Committee report, tried to address by differentiating between learning and knowledge, and reiterating the need to view learning beyond textbooks. In line with this vision, the new textbooks developed by NCERT, post NCF 2005, recognised the agency of the learner, emphasised a constructivist understanding of knowledge and learning, and endeavoured to make learning more meaningful by presenting domain-specific perspectives by which children could relate to textbook content and make sense of the world around them.
Addressing challenges
Having said that, it also does not mean that the ‘no detention’ policy and CCE should not be examined critically. However, it may not be legitimate to expect them alone to bring about significant educational reform, ignoring the hugely deficit learning environments in which most schools exist, and also the challenging circumstances in which most children learn. The CCE, which is conceptualised differently and is being implemented by almost all States, suffers from several limitations both at the level of ‘design’ and ‘implementation,’ besides other school-related challenges such as inadequate teachers, absent/irregular students, huge pupil-teacher ratios and lack of basic infrastructural facilities. Similarly, the biggest challenge that the ‘no detention’ policy faces is the need to address learning gaps and suitably equip children with grade-appropriate competencies. There is also a problem when one associates CCE and the ‘no detention’ policy with ‘no assessment,’ equates absence of board exams with absence of learning, and confuses the achievement of educational objective with the success and glory of a minuscule minority over the ignominy of several thousands of students who are mercilessly pushed out of the formal school system.
India has witnessed some very significant developments in the education sector in the last decade — a long-pending landmark RTE, an NCF which brought the child to the forefront and linked the problems of quality of education with children’s experiences in schools, reforms in assessment, and strictures against use of corporal punishment. These need to be seen in perspective rather than being viewed in isolation. Rather than dismissing them in haste, the challenges confronting their implementation need to be identified, and mechanisms to support them need to be evolved.

Let`s start from percentage of allocations.to have a sound trading cum GREEN portfolio one should have at least 20to 40 counter this is my opinion and I do have 40plus counter rather just below 80active one.As a rule I donot allocate more than 5 to 7.5% of my liquid wealth to any counter.as if it is good even 5k stock will make you rich.
LIKE ALL MY STOCK a, FSL is great.Although it didnot move like Arvind or TVs or Asian or yes bank or many more but
Trust me I made most with Radici, FSL, vip, spice, binani, sail, fortis and idbi. They were so predictable. Buy at low hatch a week and you got 3-5%.
So anyway I was getting my0.5% daily average.is it bad to have this 100% gain per annum.
This market will continue till coming  usa election in two years.so be assured apart from small hiccups.
Trade in FSL
Hold and accumulate BASANT for three years.
I will still be scarce on board as very tight with time but I may drop few lines.
Good luck.

Schools consolidate at home but expand abroadEuropean business schools consolidate at home but expand abroad
Della Bradshaw
©Nick Lowndes
The past year for European business schools has been a tale of two economies. Economic stagnation at home has resulted in consolidation, while economic growth overseas, especially in Asia, has meant rapid expansion for European business schools into these markets.
For many, the bid to teach in Asia is about more than the business opportunity: it is about the aspiration to become a globally recognised business school and one of the world’s top education players.

Fiona Devine on leaping academic boundaries
A handful of leading institutions, such as London Business School, Insead, Iese and HEC Paris, have already made the leap to global recognition.
“There are now several business schools in Europe with strong programmes, franchises and faculty,” says Peter Tufano, who was appointed dean of Saïd Business School at the University of Oxford in 2011, joining from Harvard Business School. “European business schools have strengthened considerably in the past quarter century.”
But there are some notable regional exceptions: there are no German schools in this global elite, for example. This will change, believes Udo Steffens, president of Frankfurt School of Finance & Management. “In Germany there are a few universities that are moving towards what we feel is an international business school,” he says. “These schools recruit internationally and they place internationally. In five years there will be a world-class business school in Germany.”
Others are less optimistic about European schools. Kai Peters, chief executive of Ashridge Business School in the UK, says that for those in the middle ground the situation “will get uglier”, with few places to hide. “The only safe spaces are local provision and a solid undergraduate programme,” he argues.
This “holed middle” concept, as Insead dean Ilian Mihov calls it, has two causes. The first is the rise of online learning, the second the rise in fees. “Students are saying, ‘if I can’t get an MBA from a top school, why bother?’,” he says.
Culture and language are two of the hurdles for this emerging global model, but perhaps the biggest stumbling block is money, and the funds needed to achieve global reach. The past decade has seen French business schools, which operate outside the traditional university system, adopt a merger strategy to achieve scale and offset risk.
©Nick Lowndes
In the UK, the two most prominent standalone business schools have followed suit. Henley merged with the University of Reading in 2008 and earlier this year Ashridge announced its plans to merge with Hult Business School.
But mergers bring their own problems. Prof Peters says the Ashridge-Hult merger has raised questions about how to align UK and US degree-awarding powers, how to deal with accreditations and how to manage professors and programmes. “Who owns the programmes – the business schools or the professors?” he asks. “There is more centralised control in the UK and more faculty trust in the US.”
Even single-country mergers are not easy, says Frank Bostyn, dean of Neoma, the business school created by the merger of two French Grandes Ecoles in Rouen and Reims. “In a merger you always have to take the hard decisions up front,” he says. “You only need one finance director and you have two.”
The adoption of a new name – Neoma – has also created issues around brand recognition . In France, Neoma’s new name is already quite strong, Prof Bostyn says, but “in the rest of the world it is another story – we are not automatically known”.
For those that do make a bid to be global, differentiation is key, believes Dominique Turpin, president of IMD in Switzerland, the executive education specialist. “We are moving towards a commoditisation of products and prices. Business school deans have to be obsessed with differentiation.”
We are moving towards a commoditisation of products and prices. Business school deans have to be obsessed with differentiation
- Dominique Turpin, president, IMD
Overseas alliances at degree level are increasingly popular as a way to differentiate the global from the local and regional. This March, IMD announced the launch of an executive MBA with private business school Cheung Kong in Beijing, and in June, London Business School and Fudan University in Shanghai announced they would teach a double-degree masters in management programme.
In October, Spanish business school Esade joined the club. It is launching a dual-degree MBA with Guanghua School of Management at Peking University in September 2015. At around the same time two French business schools, Audencia and ESCP Europe, also announced alliances – Audencia with two Beijing institutions , Tsinghua University and Beijing Institute of Technology, and ESCP with Tongji University in Shanghai.
Frank Vidal, dean of Audencia, believes China is now a secure market for French companies. “We have many alumni working for French companies in China. China now is in the regular course of business.”
The big unanswered question is when Asian business schools will join the cadre of globally recognised players. The biggest obstacle is securing high-quality professors, says Insead’s Prof Mihov. “It is still difficult to attract top faculty to places outside the US and Europe. The attraction is increasing, but it is not a big movement and it takes time to build a vibrant academic culture.”
Twenty-five years from now there will be top Asian business schools, but they will be in addition to US and European schools, not in place of them, believes Saïd’s Prof Tufano. “I would be shocked if there were no top business schools in the UK and Europe,” he says.

Business students’ growing appetite for food and wine courses

Tempting choices: Jean-François Ley of Inseec says a fragmented market offers opportunities
Ever since the global crisis, when careers in the financial sector lost some of their allure, business students have been developing an appetite for industries that satisfy some of life’s more basic needs. Across Europe, schools that offer specialist courses in food and drink management are extending their scope and increasing their intakes as demand rises.
Inseec, a multi-centre business school with roots in Bordeaux in France , is planning wine marketing courses in Mandarin at universities in Beijing and Shanghai, seeking a partner in California and opening an offshoot in Beaune, in the eastern French wine region of Burgundy.

How ideas about inclusivity and funding are crossing the Atlantic
That throws down the gauntlet to Burgundy School of Business in Dijon, which has been training the region’s wine trade managers for a century and launched its School of Wine & Spirits Business in September 2013.
Meanwhile, the UK’s venerable Royal Agricultural University (RAU) in Gloucestershire, which offers two specialist food industry MBAs, aims to grow from 1,200 to more than 2,000 students within five years.
Jean-François Ley, director of Inseec’s wines and spirits division, says the drinks industry offers fascinating management challenges: despite annual wine revenues of $170bn and another $300bn from spirits, and its global scope, the industry is highly fragmented.
“The biggest spirits player commands only 2 per cent of the market,” says Ley. “The need to build brands and gain market insights is crucial. In this industry marketing is the management process.”
Inseec offers undergraduate training in wines and spirits management, as well as an MBA in wine marketing and management, an MBA in spirits marketing and management and a luxury brand management MBA with a focus on food and wine. The one-year wine MBA has more than 80 participants a year and the spirits course about 30. Both are taught in English, partly in Bordeaux and partly in London .
Given the estimated 3m-3.5m jobs in the wine industry worldwide, with as many as 600,000 in France alone, the number of business school places seems modest. “Our graduates have no difficulty finding jobs,” says Ley.

French business schools are building on historic expertise to lead management education in an industry that includes more than 60 wine-producing countries and where China now ranks fifth in the consumption league table.
Burgundy’s School of Wine & Spirits Business, which has a strong emphasis on research, is the latest development in response to global demand. To complement its long-standing French-language masters in international wine and spirit trading, the school started an MSc in wine business in 2008 and an MSc in wine management in 2012. The one-year wine management MSc, which has an optional six-month internship, costs €11,480.
The number of students at Burgundy rose 30 per cent in 2014. “What I observe is increasing interest from this generation,” says Jérôme Gallo, the wine school’s director. He puts that down to three factors: the industry’s international nature, its annual growth rate of 5 per cent and the “intimate” nature of its products, savoured by the palate but evaluated by the mind.

Bringing home the bacon: RAU students
Graduates of Burgundy’s masters programme in international wine are scattered throughout the industry, creating a network for placement of interns and graduates. Like Inseec, Burgundy is responding to strong demand for wine trade education from China, where the surge in consumption is driving rising production.
The rise of new consuming and producing regions is also a factor behind the expansion at the RAU, says Kanes Rajah, dean of the university’s School of Business and Entrepreneurship. The school offers a full-time or part-time MBA in advanced farm management as well as a one- or two-year full-time MBA in international food and agribusiness and a part-time MBA in business management in the food industries, that can be spread over two, three or four years.
Technology and trade are transforming farming: digital devices measure the fertility of european cows fed on Brazilian soybeans
Prof Rajah says an MBA is not excessive for someone running a farm, because the nature of the food chain is changing dramatically. Markets have become global and farms are bigger. Large-scale industrial farmers take multimillion-dollar decisions every month about production strategies that are vulnerable to weather or political risk. Technology and trade are transforming farming and food manufacturing: digital devices, for example, measure the fertility of European cows fed on Brazilian soybeans.
A college, then, that once trained the offspring of British farmers has become a university where students from diverse backgrounds and places such as Indonesia, Malaysia, China, continental Europe and Africa rub shoulders as they learn how to feed the world.
Many don’t go back to the farms they came from, says Prof Rajah, but 96-97 per cent are employed immediately on graduation – not surprising, perhaps, as while agriculture may account for just 1 per cent of gross domestic product in the UK, the figure is 10-15 per cent in many countries.
Ludovica Leone of Bologna Business School
But globalisation has also opened up world markets to what were once regional specialities. Bologna Business School in Italy has a tradition of training managers for the country’s food industry. Four years ago, drawing on local expertise in producing and marketing Parmesan cheese, balsamic vinegar and salami, it introduced a food and drink track in its MBA. Today that is undertaken by about 15 of the 70-strong cohort and attracts participants from as far afield as Latin America, Asia and Africa. Ludovica Leone, director of the food and wine track, says about half are mature managers from the industry, while the others are typically switching career to pursue a passion, often to launch a business of their own.
SDA Bocconi School of Management in Milan also capitalises on Italian skills to offer a one-year master of management in food and beverage, catering to the hospitality and retail industries. Essec Business School offers a masters in international food industry management in Paris and Singapore, and France-based Kedge Business School offers an executive MBA with a major in wine and spirits management.
It seems likely that with growing interest in food and drink courses, an increasing number of business school graduates will be spending at least part of their working lives in muddy boots or perhaps plying a corkscrew.

Lucy Kellaway gets tough on soft skillsLucy Kellaway gets tough on soft skills
Lucy Kellaway
I am a non-European at a European business school. In feedback I have been told I lack soft skills and need to be more appreciative of cultural nuances. However, I am top of my class in corporate finance, data analysis and models, and I am also considering two job offers. This lack of soft skills does not seem to have held me back so far and I’m not sure I see the point. Am I missing something?
Yes. You are missing something enormous. Even if you want to be a boffin who deals only with numbers, you still have to learn to get on with other people. You talk about “soft skills” in a dismissive way, as if they were self-evidently less important than the hard ones. That might be true when you are starting out, but in the long run the reverse is true.
More
Can I decline the job move collection?
Many people can master the numbers, but to be able to do that and know how to deal with the whims and mood swings of your clients and colleagues takes dedication and application – that is what sorts out those who make it to the top from those who don’t.
You say that lack of soft skills hasn’t held you back so far. Well, of course it hasn’t as you have not even started your new job. I suggest you learn everything you can about different cultural practices. Then you will reduce the chances of rubbing people up the wrong way. No one wants to work with such a person, no matter how good they are at data analysis.
. . .
I have received offers of an MBA place at two European schools. One is ranked very highly and is very expensive. The other is much cheaper but is not so highly ranked. Since there is no guarantee that, whatever school I go to, I will get the consultancy job (and high salary) I am aiming for, would it be better to go for the cheaper MBA?
No. So long as you can scrabble the money together it is better to go for the school that everyone has heard of. You are right that there is no guarantee that you will land the consulting job of your dreams, but at least that firm is likely to come to the better school on a hiring drive.
An MBA is as much a calling card as a set of skills, so it is generally a wise investment to get the most prestigious calling card you can afford. And if this particular consultant turns you down, at the better school your money will have bought you a better network and a better springboard to find something else.
. . .
My aim in life has always been to set up my own business, and I now have an idea that I think will be very successful. However, I have very limited knowledge about how to set up a business. Would a one-year European-style MBA help, or would it be better to just start now and study online when I need help in particular areas?
If I were you I’d just go for it. If you have a really great idea, what are you waiting for? I wouldn’t even do an online course – I would throw everything into the business, possibly finding someone as a partner who gets the more technical stuff. You will learn by seeking advice from everyone you know who might be even halfway useful. And you will learn from the mistakes that you will inevitably make.
If you spread yourself too thinly on a multi-campus programme you never build up the networks that are half the point of getting an MBA
The one thing most new businesses are short of is cash, so I can’t see that it makes any sense at all to saddle yourself with the debts that come with an MBA. There is time for that later, if things don’t go your way. If your company fails – as most small businesses do, with or without an MBA – then is the time to start thinking about spending a year at business school to help you decide what to do next.
. . .
I am planning to study for an MBA and have narrowed my selection of schools down to one in France and one in Spain. I prefer the Spanish school, but my boyfriend is French and is very keen that I study in France. I value our relationship and don’t want to upset him, but I am beginning to feel emotionally blackmailed. What should I do?
Tell your boyfriend that we live in the age of the railway and the plane and the motor car, and that France and Spain are neighbours. Tell him that we live in a connected age. If he is in France and you in Spain he can talk to you as many times a day as he wants on FaceTime and Skype. Above all, tell him to get off your case.
This is your career and your education and it’s up to you to do what is best for you. If he can’t understand that, you might consider telling him that he isn’t the boyfriend for you.
. . .
I am deciding between one-year MBA programmes. Will a multi-campus experience stand me in better stead than studying at only one campus, or will I just end up exhausted?
I feel exhausted just thinking about the multi-campus experience. If you can’t find a single campus where you want to study, maybe you shouldn’t be doing this at all. Also, if you spread yourself too thinly you never build up the networks that are half the point of getting an MBA. So no, I wouldn’t dream of it.
. . .
My father is a management consultant and has helped me with ideas and solutions to some class assignments. My class has been told to form small teams to tackle a project. Everyone wants me on their team. I don’t mind people thinking I am a genius, but I am afraid that I may be rumbled. What should I do?
Don’t even think of letting on. There is no reason why you shouldn’t hold your head high – there is nothing to be ashamed of in recycling ideas from other people. Even geniuses do that up to a point. The only problem is if your father is so overbearing that you can’t think at all without him breathing down your neck. But I bet that’s not the case. You wouldn’t have got into the school if it were. In my darker hours I wonder what management consultants are really for. Now I know the answer: they help their offspring succeed at business school.

Des Plaines
New McHenry sheriff warns of possible job cuts
Bill Prim was sworn in Monday as the new McHenry County sheriff and was immediately faced with difficult fiscal challenges that he warned could mean job reductions.
Prim announced plans to "streamline" operations and introduced a team of three new faces.
The retired Des Plaines police commander and resident of Cary said his first project will be the "reorganizing" of the McHenry County Jail.
For the first time in 17 years, McHenry County has a new sheriff. ( Lisa Black )
Prim said he may have to cut up to 40 jobs at the jail and will not fill 17 positions that are vacant. He cited the newly penned, "pretty constricted" county budget and the county's contract with the federal government to house immigration detainees at the jail, which the sheriff's staff said is insufficiently funded. The contract is up next year.
Prim said he will reorganize and "streamline" the sheriff's department, eliminating nonessential civilian and administrative positions. He also plans to expand the county's volunteer program.
"The biggest resource the county has is its civilians," Prim said. "We want to invite the residents to come in and build relationships."
Prim, a Republican who most recently worked for the Lake County sheriff's office, said he will not hire an undersheriff to replace Andrew Zinke, who last week resigned from the department.
Zinke lost to Prim in the Republican primary.
Instead, Prim said he has hired three "highly experienced managers from widely divergent backgrounds in law enforcement who will form the core of his management team."
He is dividing the responsibilities of the sheriff's office into two major divisions, each of which will report directly to him.
cComments
Given that ICE and Obama no longer are interested in "rounding up" illegals and sending them home---why do we need all the jail overhead anymore? In the old days I heard it was a money maker up there for that county, now with Obama, no ones getting arrested, detained or deported...

Former colleague and narcotics task force leader Ricardo Pagan, of Carol Stream, who worked 23 years with the FBI and has more than 30 years in law enforcement, will lead police operations.
He also has worked as a patrol officer and major crimes detective in his home state of Ohio. His most recent assignment was as assistant special agent with the Chicago FBI in charge of criminal/violent crimes.
David Devane, of Chicago, who has 28 years in law enforcement, 24 of them with the Cook County Sheriff's Department and four with the Cook County state's attorney's office, will be responsible for the jail and general officewide administration, Prim said.
Most recently, Devane worked in media relations for the U.S. secretary of energy in Washington and the Illinois Department of Health. Devane will handle most media and communications for the department, Prim said.
Sandra Fay Salgado, of McHenry, will lead the department's human resources, budget and management operations.
Salgado, the daughter of McHenry County State's Attorney investigator Ronald Salgado, recently worked as business manager for the Lake County sheriff's office. She recently left her post on the McHenry County Board.
She served the board for 14 years, having been chairman of the human resources committee, part of the senior services grant commission and been on the mental health court task force.
Prim, who said he anticipates working closely with the state's attorney's office, replaces former Sheriff Keith Nygren, who chose not to run again after 17 years in office. Zinke had worked under Nygren since 1997.
McHenry County State's Attorney Louis Bianchi, who had a publicly rocky relationship with Nygren in recent years — having been brought up on misconduct charges in 2011 that were later dismissed based on a lack of evidence — said he welcomes "new energy" in the sheriff's office.
"Our mutual offices will get along better and … as a result will run more efficiently," Bianchi said. "We will continue to fight as we have, fight hard to represent the sheriff and his office and their good work. We expect it to be more congenial, more relaxed."

Kharagpur IITian offered whopping annual salary of over 1.5 croreComments
In one of the fattest pay package offered to an IITian ever in campus placements, a student of IIT Kharagpur has been offered a whopping annual salary of over Rs. 1.5 crore.
IIT Kharagpur officials said the salary package was among the 163 offers made by 27 visiting companies on Monday on the first day of campus placements.
The highest domestic package was of Rs. 42 lakh and highest offer from abroad was of  $250,000 (Rs 1.54 crore), the officials said.
IIT authorities have refused to disclose details about the student or the company which made the offer, saying "this brings unnecessary attention to the student."
IIT sources claimed that the 1.54 crore offer is the highest ever package received by the Kharagpur unit and among the largest ever in all IITs.
The highest number of offers (24) was made by niche analytics consulting company EXL Service Pvt Ltd due to growth induced demand, followed by international brands like Visa, Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, Cisco, Microsoft IDC.
Analytics, IT and Finance are leading so far.
The first time visitors - Parthenon, TSMC , BMGI, VISA, Baker Hughes, and Auctus Advisors - gave an encouraging response and offered large number of positions to IIT Kharagpur talents.
Professor Sudhirkumar Barai, Chairman of Career Development Center, IIT-Kharagpur, said from this year onwards special emphasis will be given to boost the confidence of the graduating students with the help of corporate workshops, case study contests, alumni mentorship session, assessment tests and soft skill training.
"The preparation has shown an impressive success in terms of day one placement this year at IIT Kharagpur. Further, there has been renewed realisation in Indian industry for highly qualified engineering professionals in Quality Engineering, Product Design and Manufacturing. IIT Kharagpur has been quick to identify this need and accordingly have initiated a programme in this field," Barai said. The total offers received so far stands at 251, which includes 88 pre-placement offers.

RBI keeps interest rates unchanged  EMIs won t go down for nowNo EMI relief as RBI guv keeps rates intact
HT Correspondents , Hindustan Times  Mumbai/New Delhi, December 02, 2014

Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan dashed expectations of the government, consumers and business leaders as he kept lending rates unchanged on Tuesday despite plunging inflation and mounting pressure to ease borrowing costs to aid a revival.
RBI governor Raghuram Rajan laughs while replying to a question during a news conference after the bi-monthly monetary policy review in Mumbai on Tuesday. (Reuters)
Unchanged interest rates would imply your home loan EMIs, which eat away large chunks of household incomes, are unlikely to fall anytime soon.
High loan rates could influence people’s decision to buy houses, cars and other consumer goods, mostly bought through loans.
The benchmark lending rate has remained unchanged since January last year, demonstrating the RBI governor’s unwavering commitment to keep inflation firmly bottled up for longer period of time,  before softening of the rather hawkish stance.
Budding revival signs in the broader economy and falling inflation rates had rekindled hopes that the RBI would lower loan rates to assist companies’ investment plans, critical to spin jobs and multiply income.
Rajan retained the repo rate -- the rate at which banks borrow from RBI -- at 8%, and kept the cash reserve ratio (CRR)-- the proportion of deposits banks to have to park with the central bank -- at 4%, in the bi-month monetary policy review.
Retail inflation eased in to a three-year low of 5.52% in October, below the central bank's target of 6% by 2016.
India’s wholesale inflation rate -- the main gauge to capture country-wide price movements -- has also plunged to a five-year low of 1.77% in October, triggering a chorus of demand for lower borrowing costs to boost investment and consumer spending.
The next monetary policy is scheduled for February 3, 2015, but Rajan did not rule out a rate revision outside of the policy calendar depending on future price movements.
“A change in the monetary policy stance at the current juncture is premature. However, if the current inflation momentum and changes in inflationary expectations continue, and fiscal developments are encouraging, a change in the monetary policy stance is likely early next year, including outside the policy review cycle,” Rajan said.
Analysts said the RBI governor could wait for cues to come from the next year’s Union budget in February before initiating any rate action.
Industry leaders have been ratcheting up their demand for cheaper loans with the government also hoping that the central bank would signal a reversal of its prolonged hawkish stance that some see as affecting capacity expansion plans.
According to experts low and stable interest rates are critical to fast-track roads, ports, airports, and railways projects to create jobs, raise non-farm incomes and catalyse large scale industrialisation across India.
Rajan, however, made it abundantly clear that the RBI would not change its stance until the central bank was convinced to have fully tamed inflation.
“The way to sustainable growth is to have low and stable inflation. We are talking of years of sustainable growth,” he said.
The RBI governor said that the key to a turnaround in the growth path of the economy in the second half of the year is a revival in investment activity –- in new as well as stalled projects –- supported by fiscal consolidation, stronger export performance and lower overall inflation.

Prim released a statement late Tuesday, calling it a "tremendous experience" to "make it to the finish" in his first bid for elected office.
"I am once again in awe of the energy and the true grit of my supporters and volunteers. This was a grassroots working campaign composed of equal parts determination, shoe leather and Republicans ready to move in a new direction," he said. "Now that we see the voters of McHenry County approve and endorse that new direction, it will be full speed ahead on implementing our shared vision of an open, accountable and transparent sheriff's office."

Life in Assads Syria is great  tweets far right British politicianBy Adam Taylor December 2 Follow @mradamtaylor

Griffin, a veteran leader in the British National Party (BNP) until he was expelled in October, was in the Syrian capital recently as a guest of the Assad regime, and he tweeted approvingly about what he saw.

Griffin was in Damascus to attend a conference on terrorism and extremism organized by the Syrian Justice Ministry. The Syrian government claims that representatives from more than 80 countries were invited to the conference, according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz , though it's unclear who these people were. Griffin appears to have been the only Briton in attendance.

It isn't the first time that Griffin has been a guest of Assad's regime. Last year, he took two trips to Syria as part of a group of members of the European Parliament, in what he described as a "peace mission." At the time, Griffin was criticized for meeting only with the Syrian government and not with any rebels.

Griffin enjoyed that trip, too. He shot video showing his hotel pool and declared that "this place is really quite normal." However, he noted that there were explosions in the distance.
Britain's far right and the Syrian regime may seem like odd bedfellows, but there's history here. Griffin has reached out before to international pariahs in the hope of finding common ground: He tried to build contacts within Moammar Gaddafi's Libya  during the 1980s, for example, though he was ultimately rebuffed. Syria, for its part, is thought to have sheltered Alois Brunner , a fugitive from Nazi Germany held responsible for the deportation of 128,500 Jews to death camps, for decades.

Across Europe, far-right groups have expressed support for Assad's government. Hungarian far-right party Jobbik has said its members "stand for the Assad government," while Jean-Marie Le Pen, former leader of France's National Front, has said that it is “not abnormal for the Syrian state to defend itself." Their position aligns neatly with that of Russia, a big backer of the Syrian regime.
Only when here can you really see the full criminality of US/EU/UK plan to use Isis as excuse to bomb Syrian army & put Islamists in power.
— Nick Griffin (@nickjgriffinbnp) November 30, 2014
In the time between Griffin's 2013 visit to Syria and his most recent, more people have gravitated toward that line of thinking. Some analysts have even suggested working with the Syrian government to combat the Islamic State militant group — a statement that would have been unthinkable just a year ago, given the human rights abuses Assad's forces have been accused of.

For Griffin, however, its unlikely that there will be any vindication. Having lost his seat in the European Parliament and watching the populist and more-moderate U.K. Independence Party steal what little support the BNP had, Griffin was expelled from his party in October. He was accused of attempting to "destabilize" the BNP. His trip to Syria won him little praise from other Twitter users:

Why so many students are spending six years getting a college degreeBy Danielle Douglas-Gabriel December 2 Follow @DaniDougPost
(Michael Okoniewski/Bloomberg News)
College, as the saying goes, is supposed to be the best four years of your life. But there's increasingly a new norm for students: spending six years getting a degree.
Even the government now measures whether students graduate on time if they do it within six years, rather than four.
Taking longer to graduate isn't cheap. It costs $15,933 more in tuition, fees and room and board for every extra year at a public two-year college and $22,826 for every added year at a public four-year college, according to a new report by the nonprofit Complete College America.
At a time when total student debt has surpassed $1 trillion, getting students to graduate on time has become critical.
So what's the reason behind students spending so much extra time getting their degrees?
Colleges have added too many unnecessary degree requirements and remedial courses that keep students in school for much longer than needed, according to the report.
A recent Education Department study found that the average graduate had accumulated 138.4 credits by the time they received a bachelor's degree, when 120 is usually sufficient. Tack on another 20.3 credits for the average amount of courses that students fail, repeat or withdraw from and those credit hours jump to 158.7 credits earned or attempted. At an estimated cost of $361 per credit, those credits start to add up.
"Most colleges and universities raise tuition and fees each year, while financial aid stays nearly constant," researchers wrote. "As scholarships and savings run out, students and their families are left to borrow more of the costs of attending school."
Administrators at Temple University and University of Texas at Austin, for example, told researchers that two extra years at their campuses increase debt by nearly 70 percent among students who borrow.
If schools want to rein in costs for students, Complete College America recommends they streamline curricula and cap the number of credit hours needed for bachelor's degree at 120 hours and for an associate degree at 60 hours.
Those hours are the already standard for a majority of degrees, though some schools have let departments pile on additional course work over the years. Capping credit hours, the report says, would make it easier for students to graduate on time as long as they take 15 credit hours a semester.
Carrying a full course load, however, may not work for students juggling school, work and family, not to mention those who simply can't afford to the cost. Nearly two thirds of students at community colleges, for instance, attend part-time because of those sorts of obligations, according to data from the American Association of Community Colleges. Earning an associates in two years would certainly reduce costs for those students, but increasing their grant aid would arguably be more effective. 
Still, schools could do a better job of creating a more direct route to graduation, the report says. Offering more sections of core classes, accepting transfer credits or simply monitoring students' course loads are just some of the strategies colleges could use to increase on-time graduation.
As it stands, only 50 out of the more than 580 public four-year institutions report on-time graduation rates at or above 50 percent for their first-time, full-time students, according to the Education Department's Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, or Ipeds.
At the University of Arizona, only 34 percent of students graduate within six years, according to Department of Education data. At Michigan State University, it's 48 percent. Overall, at flagship universities, only 36 percent of students are getting their degrees within six years.
Another part of the problem, according to Complete College America, is the "broken" system of remedial courses that students with weak academic records are required to take.
About 20 percent of college students are enrolled in remedial classes, according to the most recent data from the Education Department. That means they must take courses in math or English to help them catch up to the rest of their classmates. But those classes don't count toward a degree and tend to delay students from graduating on time.
Complete College America wants schools to offer remediation alongside college-level courses, instead of having students take remedial classes before their core courses. Think of it as intensive tutoring.
The nonprofit has been promoting a plan it calls Guided Pathways to Success (GPS),which organizes majors into a set courses that allow students to graduate in two or four years. The way it works is students agree to stick to a structured schedule of courses and electives that represent the shortest distance to completion. And in return, schools provide degree maps, monitor student progress and make sure that necessary courses are available.
Rather than all incoming freshman taking algebra, for instance, GPS would let students with no interest in science or math degrees take math courses that are relevant to their major, like statistics or quantitative-reasoning classes.
Five states, including Massachusetts and Illinois, have launched GPS initiatives in science, technology, engineering and math programs, while Georgia, Indiana and Tennessee are working to scale up broader programs rooted in the GPS model.
The spartan approach to graduation is unlikely to win fans among students who want an array of courses or the professors who teach them. Placing students on a narrow path to graduation could also deprive them of the chance to explore subjects that don't neatly fit into their major.
But at a time when graduation rates have slumped and the cost of attending college has reached stratospheric heights, it's hard to argue against more streamlined programs—and a return to four years as the norm again for college.

The saga of the forensics expert in the Michael Brown caseBy Radley Balko December 2 Follow @radleybalko
Shawn Parcells speaks about findings in the autopsy of Michael Brown during a press conference at the Greater St. Marks Family Church on August 18, 2014 in Ferguson, Missouri. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)
Over the holiday weekend, CNN aired a pretty hard-hitting investigation of Shawn Parcells , the man who has become something of a cable news celebrity after assisting in an autopsy on Michael Brown.
Parcells became an overnight media star in August when he assisted in an autopsy commissioned by Brown’s family. He appeared time and again on major media outlets as a forensic pathology expert. He said over the years he’s testified in court dozens of times in several states.
But an investigation by CNN that included interviews with attorneys, law enforcement and physicians suggests Parcells isn’t the expert he seems to be . . .
Parcells, a Kansas native, says he became interested in death at age 12 when his grandfather passed away.
“I actually started doing autopsies my junior year in high school,” he said. “I’ve been doing this a long time. I love it.”
Right after high school, renowned pathologist Michael Baden made a visit to Kansas. Parcells snapped a photo with him.
By college, Parcells said, he was teaching first-year residents how to do autopsies. The campus newspaper, The Kansas State Collegian, wrote an article about him in 1999 headlined “Morbid Curiosity.”
He received a bachelor’s degree in life sciences from Kansas State in 2003, and he said he was immediately accepted to medical school in the Caribbean, but his wife got pregnant and he wanted her to receive her care in the United States, so he didn’t attend.
Earlier this year, Parcells’ LinkedIn page said he expected to start medical school at the International University of the Health Sciences in the Caribbean starting in September 2014. Later, the date was changed to 2015.
When CNN visited Parcells in his Overland Park, Kansas, home, he presented a photo of himself onstage at what appears to be a graduation ceremony at the New York Chiropractic College.
“I got a master’s degree in anatomy and physiology, with clinical correlation,” he said.
Asked where his diploma was, he replied that it was on the way. “It’s coming,” he said. “They mail it to you.”
The next day, at another on-camera interview, the conversation went like this:
CNN: So that master’s degree in New York, you have that degree?
Parcells: I will have it next month, yes.
CNN: I don’t mean the piece of paper. I mean have you been conferred that degree?
Parcells: Yes, I will. Next month.
CNN: Right now, as we speak, you have that degree?
Parcells: No, I do not.
Parcells doesn’t claim to have any specific license or certification to do the work he does. He knows how to do autopsies from “on-the-job training,” watching pathologists and assisting them at various morgues, he said . . .
He certainly sounded knowledgeable and authoritative on August 18 when he presented the findings of the Michael Brown autopsy to a nationally televised news conference.
[Dr. Michael] Baden, who conducted the autopsy, spoke first, and then introduced Parcells, saying he “has been instrumental in the autopsy evaluation.”
“First of all, I’m Professor Shawn Parcells,” Parcells said as he stood to address the reporters.
On his LinkedIn page and to CNN, Parcells said he’s an adjunct professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas — but a spokeswoman for the university told CNN that’s not true.
“(Parcells) is not now and has never been a member of the Washburn University faculty,” university spokeswoman Michaela Saunders wrote in an email to CNN, adding that at one point, Parcells spoke without receiving pay to two groups of nursing students about the role of a pathologist’s assistant and gave a PowerPoint presentation and answered students’ questions.
Law enforcement officials in other parts of Missouri say Parcells misrepresented himself as a doctor:
Grant Gillett, a deputy sheriff in Andrew County, Missouri, said Parcells told them he was a doctor — a pathologist specifically — when he walked into the funeral home to do the Forrester autopsy.
Dustin Jeffers, who was also a deputy at the time, said Parcells identified himself as a doctor. The Andrew County Sheriff’s Office incident report refers to him as “Pathologist Shawn Parcells” and “Dr. Shawn Parcells Pathologist.”
Parcells says he never told the deputies he was a doctor.
“If they want to think I’m a doctor, that’s their issue,” Parcells told CNN. “People assume stuff all the time. And they may never ask. It’s bad that they’re assuming and that they never asked. If they want to think I’m a physician, then more power to them.”
Officials in another county in Missouri filed a complaint with the Missouri Board of Registration for the Healing Arts when they found out Parcells “conducted (an) autopsy with no pathologist present.” The board reviewed the complaint about the 2011 autopsy and voted to close the case.
Pathologists interviewed by CNN say they’re concerned that a man who has no formal education in pathology is giving testimony in court that could possibly help put innocent people in jail or let guilty people go free.
The CNN report also mentions several specific cases in which Parcells appears to have conducted autopsies on his own without a doctor present, and one bizarre case in which he may have lost a man’s brain.
The autopsy for Michael Brown’s family was allegedly conducted by Dr. Michael Baden. He’s a fairly famous forensic pathologist, generally well-regarded and board certified. But in my own reporting on the ongoing controversy involving Mississippi medical examiner Steven Hayne , I’ve found Baden to be disturbingly tolerant of the bad actors in his profession. With Hayne, for example, Baden has criticized Hayne’s work in specific cases, but generally defended him to local media outlets like the Jackson Clarion-Ledger. That a famous pathologist like Baden will defend Hayne makes it appear as though Hayne’s critics are just outside agitators and anti-death penalty activists like the Innocence Project — and that the criticisms of his massive workload and less-than-credibile testimony are mere disagreements between professionals, not the product of a man operating well outside the bounds of respectable medical science. Baden’s defenses of Hayne have given cover to state officials who have refused to conduct a systematic review of the thousands of cases in which he has testified.
I suspect that just as Baden’s defenses of Hayne skewed discussion of Hayne’s credibility, his appearance with Parcells at that press conference at least temporarily immunized Parcells from criticism. That’s troubling, because CNN’s report wasn’t exactly breaking news. Parcells’s credibility problems were actually first reported in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in May of 2013 .  That article and other allegations then resurfaced when Parcells appeared with Baden at the press conference. Here, for example, is an August 21st post at the Pathology Blawg, written anonymously by a surgical pathologist:
I first wrote about Mr. Parcells in May 2013 after an article in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch discussed concerns some Missouri prosecuting attorneys and county coroners had that Mr. Parcells, who only has a Bachelor’s degree, was performing unsupervised forensic autopsies without the appropriate qualifications.  Readers can refer to my earlier article or the Post-Dispatch piece for details.
Mr. Parcells contacted me via email a few weeks after my article went out and stated he wanted to “clear the air and present the truth”.  I called him back and we spoke for about 10 or 15 minutes, and then he provided me with a written rebuttal to the Post-Dispatch story.
Fast forward to August 2014.  After 18 year old Michael Brown was killed by Officer Darren Wilson, St. Louis County Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Mary Case performed  an autopsy . The family (or its attorney) then requested a second, private autopsy.
I was not the least bit surprised to see the family had asked Dr. Baden to perform the second autopsy, as there are very few forensic pathologists in this day and age who have the visibility and name recognition Dr. Baden has.
But I was very surprised to see Shawn Parcells standing on Dr. Baden’s right during the press conference in which the results of the second autopsy were revealed.
The post notes that by the end of August, Parcells had not only been quoted in numerous media outlets as an authority, he had been erroneously identified as a “forensic pathologist” by CBS, the BBC, the Associated Press, and in at least one article  here at The Washington Post . (You can’t be a forensic pathologist without a medical degree.)
On September 1 , the Kansas City Star ran a long article on Parcells and his sudden, national notoriety. (Fox 4 in Kansas City also ran a report in August .) The article describes the prior accusations against him, and characterizes his new-found fame as “vindication.” This passage in particular is striking:
Parcells said his work on the Brown case has him thinking, more than ever, about the future. He said he now is pondering going back to school for a master’s degree or perhaps enrolling in medical school.
“I need to get more credentials,” he said. “I love forensics and helping families. I’m OK with going to the next level.”
Think about that for a moment. This has been one of the most volatile, closely-watched stories of the year, and a story in which much of America is still trying to figure out what happened. It is a story with profound implications on race relations and policing — one where the slightest change in a narrative could have cascading effects throughout the country. An autopsy won’t always tell you what happened, but it can certainly help guide the narrative. An unethical medical examiner can do a lot of damage. And yet here was someone quoted authoritatively in newspapers across the country as a forensic pathologist, who was being proclaimed as a medical expert on cable news show after cable news show . . . now admitting he “need[ed] to get more credentials” — and pondering that perhaps he’ll go to medical school . . . someday. And he continued to appear on cable news after those admissions.
How does this happen? I think Baden’s implicit endorsement certainly contributed. The entire field of forensics is also rife with problems. The courts  have also done a poor job keeping bad science out of criminal trials, keeping charlatans off the witness stand, and separating the good, science-based methods of analysis from subjective hokum. This is just another manifestation of that problem.
But the media outlets who continued to give Parcells a platform don’t get off the hook. (And that includes CNN itself .) As the Star article points out, one reason why Parcells became a regular on cable news is that he was one of the few people with inside knowledge who was willing to talk about the case. They were giving Ferguson saturation coverage. He was willing to talk. It was a good fit. Never mind that the guy had no business offering himself up as an expert. Cable news is more about stoking biases and inflaming partisans than about informing viewers.
And bias is part of the problem as well. Highly-charged, emotional stories continue to produce some strikingly unskeptical reporting, particularly stories that include a racial/political component. Several conservative websites, for example, picked up on Parcells’s  history back in August . But Parcells was hired by the Brown family, so progressive sites like Wonkette belittled the accusations against Parcells , and accused the conservative sites of pushing their own narrative. Both sides were doing the pushing, of course. And it’s worth noting that Gateway Pundit, the same conservative site that correctly warned about Parcells, was also quick to publish erroneous information that advanced its own preferred Ferguson narrative.
A climate like this doesn’t allow any room to be both skeptical of Parcells’s credibility problems and still troubled by the shooting of Michael Brown. As with the Trayvon Martin story, once the lines have been drawn, nuance is dead. You’re either all-in on all of the talking points, or you’re on the other side.
Once a story has been infected with this level of conflict, neither side is much interested in facts or truth. Pointing out that Shawn Parcells may be a fraud is just signalling that you support Darren Wilson. Mocking those who question Parcells’s credibility lets the world know that you’re with the Brown family. Unfortunately, whether or not the guy who assisted on Brown’s autopsy and has since been proffering his opinions on televisions across America actually is a fraud quickly becomes irrelevant.

The FTC just scored a victory in its suit against AmazonBy Brian Fung December 2 Follow @b_fung

A federal judge won't dismiss the Federal Trade Commission's lawsuit against Amazon over the company's practice of billing parents for in-app purchases their children made without parental approval.
The lawsuit alleges that Amazon failed to stop children from spending millions of dollars of their parents' money for virtual items in online games and other apps on devices such as Amazon's Kindle Fire tablet. Some of these individual purchases cost as much as $100 each. (Amazon founder Jeffrey P. Bezos also owns The Washington Post.)
Amazon argues that it adequately warns customers when an app allows for in-app purchases. It also says that the FTC couldn't prove that the bills that the kids racked up were "unauthorized" by parents.
But Judge John C. Coughenour disagreed with that reasoning  Monday, saying Amazon may still have violated federal laws against unfair billing, whether the charges were authorized or not. In any event, Coughenour added, it's Amazon's responsibility to prove that the charges were authorized, and it has not done that.
"Though notice of in-app purchases and the possibility of parental controls may have enabled some customers to avoid in-app purchases," Coughenor wrote, "the facts presently before the Court do not suggest so much care and clarity as to warrant dismissal. The FTC has sufficiently alleged that the injury to Amazon customers was not reasonably avoidable."
So now it looks like the FTC's lawsuit will move forward. An Amazon spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Wall Street rises  boosted by energy despite oil weaknessEnergy rally boosts Wall St. despite global growth woes
By Rodrigo Campos, Reuters

U.S. stocks rose in a volatile Tuesday session as energy shares rallied and investors bet the Federal Reserve will be cautious in removing support in the face of a more fragile global economy.
Futures had crumbled in early trading as the ruble neared 80 per U.S. dollar, down 21 percent. The Russian currency sharply pared its losses and was down about 3 percent, near 68 per dollar.

Brent crude fell as much as 4.2 percent but was last down 1.2 percent at $60.36 a barrel. U.S. crude, which fell as much as 4.1 percent, was recently up 0.2 percent at $56.04 a barrel after gaining as much as 2.2 percent.
Energy shares, up 2.9 percent, were the largest gainers on the S&P 500.
"There were many, many stocks, especially in the energy sector that were just trading at absolutely ridiculous prices to their fair market valuation," said Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in Charlotte, Vermont.

"That is really what started the rally, when investors really started to come into the energy stocks."
Chevron, up 2.6 percent, was leading the points advance in the sector. Chevron's forward price-to-earnings ratio was at 13.6 at the close on Monday, compared to the S&P 500's 16.1, meaning investors pay less for every dollar of Chevron's earnings than they do for the S&P 500 overall.
Among the top percentage gainers, Nabors Industries, up 7.6 percent, had a forward P/E of 8.6, while Denbury Resources' P/E was 8.9. Denbury rose 8.4 percent.
The 43 components of the S&P 500 energy sector were in positive territory.
At 12:57 p.m. EST (1757 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average rose 118.86 points, or 0.69 percent, to 17,299.7, the S&P 500 gained 12.12 points, or 0.61 percent, to 2,001.75 and the Nasdaq Composite added 11.51 points, or 0.25 percent, to 4,616.67.
Market participants also said bets on the Federal Reserve's next move were giving stocks support. Fed officials will decide this week whether to make a critical change to their policy statement that would widen the door for interest rate hikes next year. In October, The Fed repeated that benchmark rates were unlikely to rise for a "considerable time."
"Perhaps markets think the Fed will not be as on-schedule on taking out that language," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.
She said the market is betting the Fed will give consideration to rapidly changing financial conditions. A Fed statement and news conference are expected on Wednesday.
CVS Health Corp, rose 3.8 percent to $94.14 after a strong 2015 forecast. 3M lifted its dividend and was the top points gainer on the Dow industrials with a 2.2 percent advance.
Boeing, up 2.4 percent at $124.95, was among the best performers after it raised its dividend and perked up its buyback program.
NYSE advancing issues outnumbered decliners 2,018 to 996, for a 2.03-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,714 issues rose and 945 fell for a 1.81-to-1 ratio.
The S&P 500 was posting 10 new 52-week highs and 39 lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 22 new highs and 154 lows.

Anil Sinha appointed new CBI directorAnil Kumar Sinha appointed new CBI director
Mahesh Langa , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, December 02, 2014

CBI special director Anil Kumar Sinha was appointed CBI director late on Tuesday night, the first agency director to be appointed with bipartisan support. He has been appointed for two years.
Anil Sinha has been chosen as CBI director to succeed outgoing chief Ranjit Sinha after a meeting in Delhi.
The Bihar cadre IPS officer’s appointment came within hours of a meeting of a panel comprising Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge and the CJI. The committee had short-listed the names of two 1979 batch police officers, Sinha and National Investigation Agency chief Sharad Kumar, to lead the premier agency.
Modi later picked Sinha’s name and ordered his appointment. PK Mishra, additional principal secretary to the PM, confirmed Sinha’s appointment to HT.
As reported by HT on Tuesday, the government had discovered at the last minute that the high-powered panel did not really have the power to select the next director. Instead, it could only recommend a panel of officers.
This provision complicated the selection process, leading to procedural delays in Sinha’s appointment orders issued late Tuesday.
Government sources said Sinha was the natural choice, given his wide experience in fighting corruption. Other police officers in the running included 1977-batch Prakash Mishra, special secretary at the home ministry, and the police chiefs of Rajasthan and Maharashtra, Omendra Bhardwaj and Sanjeev Dayal, respectively.
Anil Kumar Sinha will succeed Ranjit Sinha, who had a tumultuous tenure of two years at the helm of affairs in CBI. Ranjit Sinha retired on Tuesday in the glare of a recent controversy with Supreme Court directing him to recuse from 2G scam probe a fortnight ago.

Supreme Court SC warns govt over gagging social mediaSC warns govt over gagging social media

The Supreme Court on Tuesday warned the Centre it would make inoperative certain controversial provisions of the Information Technology (IT) Act often invoked by authorities to muzzle free speech on social media, if it failed to clarify its stand within a week.

"Heavens are not going to fall if the provisions are stayed... because this country has been in existence for the past 60 years without these provisions," a bench headed by Justice J Chelameswar said.
"Either you file the affidavit within a week or we will stay the operation of the provisions until we dispose of the matter," the bench told additional solicitor general Maninder Singh as he sought two weeks to file an affidavit.
The Centre is to clarify its stand on a two-year-old petition seeking to declare unconstitutional sections 66A and 74 of the IT Act.
While Section 66A provides for maximum three-year imprisonment for sending 'offensive' or 'annoying' messages through a computer or communication device, Section 74 provides for two-year jail term for intermediaries hosting such content.
Citing the arrests made under the two sections by various state police, petitioner Shreya Singhal contended the arrests amounted to curtailment of freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. The provisions were vague and broadly worded, she contended.
As Singh insisted that the matter be adjourned for two weeks, the bench retorted, "We leave the choice to you. Either you file an affidavit within a week or we will stay the operation of the provisions. The choice is yours."
The SC’s warning came after the petitioner’s counsel Manali Singhal opposed grant of yet another opportunity to the Centre to spell out its stand. She said the PIL was filed way back in April 2012 and the Centre had not come out with any categorical stand.
The bench agreed with her, saying, "This matter cannot be treated lightly. Two years have passed and there is no definite answer from you (Centre)." It fixed December 9 to hear the matter further.
Shreya petitioned the SC assailing the arrests of two girls in Mumbai in November 2012 for a Facebook post against the shutdown of the metropolis during Shiv Sena supremo Bal Thackeray’s funeral procession.
Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasreen, facing a case in Uttar Pradesh for posting certain 'objectionable comments' in a tweet in 2012, is also a petitioner before the SC. She has sought quashing of the case, which was registered in Bareli district after her tweet criticising AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal for meeting Maulana Tauqeer Raza Khan, became public. Khan had issued a fatwa against Nasreen in 2007.
Last year, the Centre had issued a general circular to all the states and union territories mandating that prior permission of an Inspector General/DCP rank officer should be taken before arresting a person under these provisions.

Wyoming governor will push Medicaid expansionBy Reid Wilson December 2 Follow @postreid
Wyoming Gov. Matt Mead (R) (Photo courtesy Gov. Matt Mead’s office)
Wyoming Gov. Matt Mead (R) was once among the handful of state executives to sue the federal government over the Affordable Care Act. Now, he says he wants his state to expand Medicaid under the ACA to cover thousands of low-income residents.
In a Monday press conference, Mead said he would press the state legislature to act on a Medicaid expansion plan put forward last week by the state Department of Health.
“I agree it is not a good piece of legislation, but, as I see where we are, I think we have to be realistic and say this is the current law of the land and we need to either go forward with this or if the legislature wants to come up with a different plan, I certainly would be open to that,” Mead said Monday, according to the Casper Star-Tribune . “But I don’t think we can say to those people in Wyoming who are working who cannot get insurance that we’re not going to do anything.”
Wyoming is one of a handful of Republican-led states that has negotiated with the federal Department of Health and Human Services to come up with their own version of Medicaid expansion. The Wyoming Health Department’s plan, called the Strategy for Health, Access, Responsibility and Employment , would set up two tiers for Medicaid recipients: All participants would make co-payments, and those with higher incomes would pay monthly premiums of $25 to $50. Participants would have access to employment assistance programs like job search services and vocational rehabilitation programs.
The SHARE plan would cover an estimated 17,600 low-income Wyoming residents and help reduce the $200 million in uncompensated care state hospitals provide. The Health Department said it would add 800 jobs without any additional costs to the state. Accepting federal funding would mean up to $100 million for the state.
Republicans who control the state legislature have been extremely skeptical of Medicaid expansion plans. The state Senate voted 21-9 against expanding Medicaid in February, though they did allow the Health Department to negotiate with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to seek a waiver to conduct the program their own way.
Mead himself said last December he didn’t want his state to accept federal money to expand the program, in the wake of the ACA’s disastrous roll-out.
There’s no guarantee legislators will go along with the Mead-backed plan. State Sen. Charlie Scott (R) said a preliminary committee, meeting in advance of next year’s legislative session, will take up a version of Medicaid expansion that would use federal dollars to create health-savings accounts, similar to an approach taken by Arkansas last year.
So far, 27 states and the District of Columbia have agreed to expand Medicaid to cover low-income residents, including nine states with Republican governors . Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam (R) and North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) have also said they will consider ways to expand the program.
Many of those Republican governors, facing reluctant state legislatures, have negotiated with HHS to expand Medicaid in unique ways, often by calling expansion something else . Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) sought and received a waiver that allowed federal money to expand the Healthy Indiana Plan, which creates personal health funds linked to insurance plans with high deductibles. Outgoing Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett (R) sought a waiver that would have included work requirements.
Democratic governors who lead states with Republican legislatures have used alternative means to accept federal Medicaid expansion dollars. New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan (D) and Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe (D) pushed a version that would pay for private insurance for low-income residents, both of which won approval from Republicans in the legislature.
“There’s a lot of trying to say they’re not doing Obamacare so that they can call it something different,” Diane Rowland, a health policy expert and executive vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said in an interview earlier this year. “They’re trying to put some distance between the straight concept of a Medicaid expansion so they can build a coalition in the legislature.”

BJP’s offer: 4-5 Cabinet and 7 MoS berths
After a month of squabbling over the contours of its participation in the Devendra Fadvanis government, the Shiv Sena on Tuesday finally looked set to make up with the BJP and join the Maharashtra government as the Chief Minister embarks on first expansion of his Council of Ministers. This comes less than a week before the Maharashtra Assembly Winter Session in Nagpur scheduled on December 8.
The BJP is said to have offered the Sena four to five cabinet and seven Minister of State berths. Though there was no clarity on it, the Sena is billed to get the public works department, power, tourism, agriculture, and energy and water conservation ministries among others. After weeks of bargain in vain for anything less than the portfolios of home ministry and deputy CM, the Sena seems to have finally relented. After ending their 25-year-old relationship just before the elections due to disagreements on seat-sharing, the two parties engaged in a month-long stand-off on the Sena’s inclusion into the minority government.
The formal announcement of the alliance is likely to be made on Wednesday upon the return of Mr. Fadnavis who is currently in New Delhi for consultations with the central BJP leadership.
The expansion of the ministry is expected on December 5, as the state government has announced three-days of mourning after the death of state’s former Chief Minister A. R. Antulay.
After the meeting with the Sena on Tuesday, Mr. Fadnavis flew to New Delhi and briefed BJP chief Amit Shah about the development. "Talks have been positive. I'm sure a decision will be made soon," the CM said. Senior Sena leader and MP Anil Desai said echoed that a decision would be conveyed soon. “The BJP has given its proposal to our leader Uddhav Thackeray. He is directly co-ordinating with the BJP leadership.”
The Sena’s entry into the government will bring the minority government, which has 122 MLAs, a major relief and a comfortable majority of 185 seats in the 288-member Assembly. Not only will the alliance ensure a stable government but also effectively thwart the bargaining power of the NCP, which was providing unconditional outside support to the BJP with its 41 MLAs.
However, the NCP’s short liaison with the BJP, though not short on controversy and embarrassment for the ruling party, has done its part in reducing the negotiating power of the Sena vis-à-vis the BJP in allocation of portfolios.
The Sena and BJP met late on Tuesday night to thrash out the remaining differences in portfolio allocation after earlier in the day Mr. Fadnavis has said around 70-80 percent of the talks were completed.

On the front lines of the battle for Kobani, Kurdish female fighters have been playing a major role in helping defend the Syrian town from an onslaught by the Islamic State extremist group. Pervin Kobani, the 19-year-old daughter of a farmer, is one of them.
She is part of a team holding an eastern front-line position that comes under regular attack from the extremist fighters, who have been trying to seize the town since mid-September.
An exclusive report shot by videojournalist Jake Simkin inside Kobane late last month offered a rare, in-depth glimpse of the destruction that more than two months of fighting has inflicted on the Kurdish town in northern Syria by the Turkish border. It also illustrated what life is like for fighters like Pervin, who says she doesn’t really have dreams beyond the present.
“We must save our love for Apo, and Kurdistan and our martyrs,” she said, referring to Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, whose group has been fighting Turkey for Kurdish autonomy. Pervin left home and took up arms two years ago as the overstretched forces of Syrian President Bashar Assad withdrew from Kurdish areas in northern Syria. She joined the Syrian Kurdish women’s self-defence force, known by its Kurdish acronym YPJ. The female YPJ fighters are now integrated with the men’s units, the YPG.
“I didn’t really have any other ambitions. I just wanted to live a free life, as a woman, [to] be able to see our reality, and have our rights and just live,” she said.
Aided by a small Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga force and Syrian rebels, they have been stubbornly defending the town since mid-September and have been aided by over 280 airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition. “We won’t allow the terrorist groups in until the last drop of our blood,” Pervin said.
After half a year serving away from her hometown, she returned with Kurdish forces two months ago to Kobane. Most fighting happens at night. The fighters can only sleep during the day, with a rotating two-hour sentry watch. Three weeks ago, Pervin bumped into her father on a street corner. She was surprised to see him holding a gun. She didn’t know that he too had decided to fight.
Last week, Simkin traveled with Pervin to the western front, to see her father once again. She says he is now her comrade first but she hugs him like a father anyway.

The nation's top CEOs trimmed their forecasts for sales and capital spending but boosted their hiring plans over the next six months, according to the Business Roundtable's fourth-quarter survey.
Corporate leaders also predicted the economy will grow a modest 2.4% next year, below the forecasts of many economists who expect the nation's gross domestic product to increase about 3% in 2015, up from 2% to 2.5% this year.
On a conference call with reporters, Randall Stephenson, chairman of the Business Roundtable and CEO of AT&T, said overhauling corporate taxes and immigration and providing President Obama greater authority to negotiate trade agreements are critical to fueling stronger growth.
Monthly Markets Checkup: 6 things for December
"The economy ended the year essentially where it started -- performing below its potential," Randall Stephenson, chairman of the Business Roundtable and CEO of AT&T, told reporters.
The economy is expected to slow in the current quarter after strong growth the previous two quarters offset weakness early in the year that was largely due to  harsh winter weather.
Seventy-four percent of the 129 CEOs surveyed expect their companies' sales to increase over the next six months, up from 73% in the third quarter. But 9% expect sales to decrease, also up from 7% the previous quarter.
The CEOs also pulled back their investment plans; 36% expect capital spending to increase, down from 39% in the third quarter.
Hiring plans, however, picked up. Forty percent of the CEOs surveyed said their firms' employment will rise the next six months, compared with 34% in the third quarter. The survey was conducted Oct. 22-Nov. 12.
Stephenson urged Congress to extend corporate tax breaks that are set to expire and pass broader corporate tax changes that would encourage companies to invest in the U.S. He also said Obama's planned executive action to help about 4 million illegal immigrants is insufficient, adding that  Congress should pass a sweeping immigration bill.
Congress, he said, also should grant Obama trade promotion authority, which would give the president the power to negotiate trade pacts that Congress could not amend or filibuster but would still have to approve.
Stephenson said slowing global economies, such as in the euro zone and China, "can have nothing but a suppressive effect" on U.S. corporate sales as U.S. exports slow. But  he downplayed the effects of a strengthening dollar, which makes the nation's exports more expensive for overseas buyers.
He also said tumbling oil and gas prices "can be nothing but positive" for U.S. corporations, such as his own, AT&T. "It's more money in consumers' pockets for smartphones and iPhones," he said.

Money too little  justice toolateWritten by Milind Ghatwai | Bhopal |
Posted: December 3, 2014 1:16 am
Thirty years on, the quest for justice and rightful compensation continues for survivors of the Bhopal gas leak that killed thousands of people and left lakhs maimed.
From a lower court in Bhopal to the Supreme Court, several petitions are pending for bringing to justice the alleged perpetrators of one of history’s worst industrial disasters, for enhanced compensation, and for environmental remediation around the plant site.
The government has paid Rs 3,842 crore as compensation for 5.74 lakh victims, but this came from an amount settled with Union Carbide in 1989.
Following a revised estimate of casualties, and an enhancement of compensation rates by a group of ministers in 2010, the government has filed for another Rs 7,786 crore in a curative petition that the Supreme Court has admitted but is yet to hear.
The settlement was for $470 million, which worked out to Rs 3,097 crore by the time it was distributed, with government ex gratia making up the rest.
This was based on an original estimate of 3,000 deaths, which has since risen to 5,295 with more claims being filed, besides 20,000 cases of temporary disability and 50,000 of various other injuries, which the curative petition now puts respectively at 35,455 and over 5 lakh. Activists say even these figures are too low. A government source said only 42,000 of the victims have been paid the full, revised amount.
Prime accused Warren Anderson, then Union Carbide chairman, died in the US this year without having faced trial in India. He had been declared an absconder several times by the trial court but India never got the US to extradite him.
A lower court in 2010 sentenced eight others accused. The two- year jail term for a tragedy that killed thousands contrasts with the US government’s claim for billions of
dollars following 11 deaths due to a British Petroleum oil spill in the Gu
lf of Mexico.
A curative petition filed by the government in the wake of the uproar against the two-year sentence was rejected by the Supreme Court. The accused, all of them Indians including industrialist Keshub Mahindra, got bail immediately and their appeal against the verdict is pending.
When US President Barack Obama visits India on Republic Day, activists plan to highlight the matter of compensation and the refusal of Dow Chemical, which took over Union Carbide in 2001, to appear in the ongoing criminal case in Bhopal. A stay ordered by the MP High Court against summoning Dow was vacated in October 2012. Last month, the lower court again issued a notice asking Dow to send its representatives.
“Since Anderson died unpunished, the government should now move for continued…

Traffic police lauded on Facebook for goodworkBy: Express News Service | Mumbai |
Posted: December 3, 2014 1:13 am
In a word or rather Facebook post of appreciation for Mumbai traffic police, Nilesh Shah, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Axis Capital, Mumbai, detailed the efforts of two traffic constables posted Monday evening near Trident Hotel in Nariman Point. He lauded the two traffic constables and said he “was feeling proud the way those two constables managed the show.”
Overwhelmed with their sincerity, Shah took to the social networking site to share the incident that took place near the hotel in the evening.
Traffic constable Govind Shankar Pawar (42), a resident of Andheri was on duty at the Air India signal at 8 pm when a huge traffic jam was reported.
Shah was standing near Trident hotel when he noticed a heavy traffic jam due to a wedding celebration. With nearby roads dug up, the traffic jam only worsened.
In his post, Shah said that the cop was later seen requesting Trident Hotel staff to allow more cars in their porch, however, the hotel employees did not pay heed and refused to offer help. The staff also refused to call their managers despite repeated requests by Pawar.
Speaking to Newsline, Pawar, who was on duty from 2 pm to 10 pm at the signal, said, “I called a traffic cop on duty near the LIC signal as the traffic situation was growing worse. We approached the Trident security staff to clear two vehicles at a time but they did not listen.
They even refused to call their manager, following which I had to restrict vehicles from going inside the hotel. Only senior citizens or handicapped persons were allowed to go in cars.”
Shah, in his post, noted that due to the cops directive, many people were forced to get off their vehicles and walk for some distance.
Shah wrote, “Most importantly, the snobbish, rich customers who had to alight outside the porch and walk ten steps into the Hotel became furious. Most of them started abusing the traffic constables. All kind of expletives were freely used.”
Expressing his anguish on Facebook, Shah said that none of the well educated people who arrived in Mercedes, BMWs or Audis were interested in helping the cops.
“Most carwallahs (vehicle owners) were worth putting behind bars for obstructing and abusing a public servant,” noted Shah in his post.
Reacting to the incident, traffic cop Pawar said, “Sometimes during celebrations we do come across people who shout at us. We are in uniform and our only job is to uphold the Law. I just ignore when people abuse or shout back because I cannot do anything about it.”
Joint Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Dr B K Upadhyay said that it was a criminal offence to abuse or obstruct traffic cops from their duty and guilty are booked for such misbehaviour.
“People should cooperate with traffic cops and understand the difficult nature of their job. They stand in difficult circumstances all day long and it is unfair to behave in this manner with them. However, there are some citizens who do write to us to appreciate our men,” continued…

CR turns to Bollywood film to keep an eye onmiscreantsBy: Express News Service | Mumbai |
Posted: December 3, 2014 1:10 am
The Central Railway (CR) has turned to a Bollywood film script to keep a watch on miscreants, including thieves at railway stations, with the administration approaching private detective agencies in carrying out surveillance on railway premises.
Recent Bollywood film Bobby Jasoos, starring actor Vidya Balan in a detective role, appears to have been the inspiration behind the move.
Sunil Kumar Sood, General Manager of CR, during an Idea Exchange on Tuesday, said a private agency was approached recently for the purpose.
“We want to involve private detective agencies to spot and provide evidence against miscreants. We told the agency to not only provide photographs, but also ensure that a strong case is made to lodge an FIR against the culprit,” said Sood.
While talks are on, CR has also announced a reward of Rs 5000 for detection of serious crimes and Rs. 1,000 for simple crime like chain snatching for individuals or other agencies that might be interested in helping the railways.?
Under the scheme, individuals or detective agencies will report incidents of crimes on trains and railway premises along with substantial evidence against a person.?
The administration expects to get documentary evidences like photographs and videos in crimes like robbery, dacoity, chain snatching, theft of mobile phones and laptops or in cases of crime against women.
The railways will give cash rewards to detectives who are successful in submitting evidence that helps in the registration of an FIR.
While CR has sought inspiration from films, the Western Railway (WR) has opted for a similar ‘third eye’ project called ‘Mitra Yojana’, where people present or working at railway stations will keep a watch and tip-off the Railway Protection Force (RPF) about suspicious activities.Under the new scheme, the RPF has managed to make over 1,000 such friends like shoe-shine boys, railway porters, ragpickers among others, between Churchgate and Virar, who are providing ground intelligence to RPF officers.

Bird hits: HC tells BMC to ensure no garbage is dumped aroundairportWritten by Ruhi Bhasin | Mumbai |
Posted: December 3, 2014 1:06 am | Updated: December 3, 2014 8:32 am
Keeping in mind the safety of lakhs of passengers who travel by air, the Bombay High Court on Tuesday directed the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to come up with a scheme to ensure that no garbage is dumped in the vicinity of the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport. This is with the view to prevent instances of bird hits.
The petitioner Datta Mone, through his PIL, has sought cancellation of licences of Deonar abattoir and removal of all dumping areas within the 10 km of the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport.
“Keeping in mind the safety of lakhs of passengers traveling by air through the Chatrapati Shivaji International Airport, we direct the municipal commissioner for taking necessary action,’’ said Justices A S Oka and A S Gadkari.
The HC has asked the commissioner to appoint an additional municipal commissioner to file a compliance report under Rule 91 of the Indian Aircraft Rules, 1937, which prohibits animal slaughter and disposal of rubbish in the airport vicinity without a go-ahead from the DGCA.
“We direct the BMC to place a scheme before the court. Till the formulation of the scheme, BMC should take all possible steps to ensure that no garbage collects in the vicinity of the airport which is prohibited by Rule 91,’’ said the HC. The BMC has been asked to submit their compliance report by January 9, 2015.
During the last hearing, the petitioner had sought time to check the veracity of the claim made by BMC through an affidavit filed, in response to the court’s earlier orders, on removal of garbage from sites surrounding the airport along with preventive measure taken regarding bird hits.
The petitioner, on Tuesday,  submitted photos of his findings which reflected  a sorry state of affairs. “To put it mildly the photos submitted to us shows a sorry state of affairs,” the court observed.
The PIL states that as per provisions of Regulation 31, clause (f) of development Control Regulation for Greater Bombay, 1991, licenses cannot be issued to carry out or run abattoirs and dumping grounds in and around 10 kms of the Airport.
As per an earlier order, the municipal commissioner had accepted responsibility of the corporation to ensure necessary steps are taken including removing filth from the immediate vicinity of the Airport for the purpose of preventing bird hits.

View from the left: AgendaUnmaskedWritten by Ruhi Tewari |
Posted: December 3, 2014 1:04 am
Claiming that former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the “mask the RSS needed then to attract political allies to form the government at the Centre”, the CPM’s People’s Democracy has said the RSS no longer needs such a mask with Narendra Modi as prime minister. “With the BJP now securing a majority on its own under the leadership of Narendra Modi, albeit with a mere 31 per cent of the polled vote, the need for such a mukhota seems to have become unnecessary for the RSS,” an editorial states.
“If any reconfirmation of this was ever necessary, it has now come.
Addressing the inaugural session of the three-day World Hindu Congress on November 21 at New Delhi, Ashok Singhal, VHP leader, hailed Narendra Modi for leading the BJP to victory in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls and said that power had returned to a ‘Hindu swabhimani (proud Hindu)’ in Delhi after eight centuries,” it adds. It also believes that Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh “confirmed this unmasking” when he recently said that the RSS is not an external force.
The editorial alleges that a “revamp of the educational system to promote ‘Hindu’ values” is underway. “The RSS had always used its control of the Central government to change the syllabus and rewrite Indian history accordingly,” it states. “The recourse to promote obscurantism and religious fanaticism is aimed at buttressing communal polarisation through the spread of hate against the religious minorities particularly the Muslim minorities. Clearly, the RSS/ BJP have embarked on a concerted effort to completely change the country’s education system and to make it patently conducive for the propagation and advance of a ‘Hindu Rashtra’,” it adds.
Empty promises
The CPI’s New Age says that the first six months of the Modi government has been “marked by [a] game of figures to hoodwink people”.
“A day before the start of the winter session of Parliament, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was boasting that India will achieve a GDP growth rate of 8.5 per cent. He projected a very rosy picture of the economy. The very next day, newspapers carried reports that in the second quarter of the Modi regime, the GDP growth rate has come down by half a point,” an editorial says.
It also accuses the government of remaining “mum” on inflation. This silence, it argues, also “applies to the issue of bringing back the black money stashed away in foreign banks. During the campaign for the Lok Sabha elections, Narendra Modi had promised to bring back the entire black money within a hundred days of assuming power… Now he says he does not continued…

Four held for selling adulterated milk with fakelogosBy: Express News Service | Mumbai |
Posted: December 3, 2014 12:56 am
The Mumbai police’s Crime Branch has arrested four for allegedly selling adulterated milk manufactured in packets bearing forged logos of milk brands for the past two years.
The arrests were made by Unit VIII of the Crime Branch late last month, after the police got a tip-off about the racket.
The police said that after verifying a tip-off, they arrested three persons, Ramesh Jala (34), Mahindra Jala (30) and Alesh Boyja (28) from an apartment in Sambhaji Nagar, Vile Parle on November 24, and recovered 5,300 one-litre packets of adulterated milk from the apartment.
We went on to arrest the main accused in the case, Shankar Bimanaboyna (35), on November 27, who manufactured the milk packets in his residence in Goregaon. We have seized three sewing machines from his house,” said Deepak Phatangare, senior police inspector, Unit VIII.
The police said that the accused used to siphon small amounts of milk from packets of branded milk products and then fill it in the packets that they manufactured.
“These forged packets would have the logos of milk brands that would help the accused sell their adulterated items. Twenty five per cent of the packet would be filled with water and would be mainly sold in a frozen condition to small hotels, tea stall owners and housewives across the city,” Phatangare added.
According to the police, Bimanaboyna, during interrogation has said that he has been making the packets for the past two years.
The police has charged all the four accused for adulteration of food or drinks intended for sale, cheating, dishonesty and criminal conspiracy under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) in addition to various sections from the Food and Drug Administration Act.

U.S. stocks gained Tuesday after declining in the previous session -- with the Dow Jones industrial average hitting a new record close.
The Dow, S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite each ended up 0.6%.

Suspected family murderer still on the run | USA NOW
Dec 16, 2014

This is how the inevitable army of Obama robots will be createdPresident Obama stepped away from the White House Maker Faire last June to take in a novelty: A bust of himself printed out of plastic, created from a scan of his body.
This bust, to be specific:
(Smithsonian Institution)
The bust was created using handheld scanners, one of the two ways in which the president's likeness was captured. The other involved an array of cameras and lighting that looks remarkably high-tech but, by the time your grandkids see it, will seem as dorky and out-of-touch as footage of those eight-winged airplane prototypes . Such is life.
But text descriptions aren't always helpful. The White House published a video of the process  Tuesday that does a better job explaining (and showing) the process.
The Smithsonian took a 3D portrait of President Obama, creating the highest resolution digital model of a head of state. (The White House)
The idea appears to have come from the existing life masks of presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Those were created by applying plaster directly to the presidents' faces, resulting in a one-of-a-kind re-creation of the facial features. Two of Lincoln's life masks have been digitized by the Smithsonian already, however, letting you manipulate them in 3D space.
( Here is the other .)
The bust is an artifact of the "third Industrial Revolution," according to Tom Kalil of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. It's a relatively trivial application of technology that holds real promise. A few days ago, NASA began 3D-printing objects in outer space -- meaning that astronauts have the ability to fabricate new objects from where they are, instead of needing to be resupplied from Earth. (At least for small plastic widgets or, like, iPhone cases .)
The 3D model of the president doesn't appear to be available online yet, which is too bad, because enterprising 3D-printing wizards could get to work doing things like making sculptures of Obama riding a dinosaur while holding a rocket launcher. I mean, that already exists , but the likeness of the president isn't very good. (You can make a Lincoln-riding-a-rocket-raptor model if you want, though, from these files .)
Eventually, the bust pictured above will be added to the National Portrait Gallery. And once the 3D model is released, you too can print out a copy of President Obama to add to your own Neighborhood Portrait Gallery. The future is now.

Good or bad idea Kentucky school districts attempt to do away with snow daysBy Angela Fritz December 2 Follow @angelafritz

In Kentucky this winter, mom and dad will no longer the only people in the family that have the option to telecommute during inclement weather.
After last year’s brutal winter, which kept students at home for four times as many snow days as the previous year, Kentucky is launching an educational experiment. They’re attempting to do away with snow days all together, and instead will ask students to work on assignments from home, called “snow packets.”
The AP reports :
Thirteen school districts are part of an expanded program allowing students to complete assignments from home either by downloading them or working from packets prepared and sent home ahead of time. In exchange, the state will forgive up to 10 makeup days.
“If you could make this work, you would never have a snow day,” said David Cook, director of innovation and quality management for the Kentucky  Department of Education . “You would just have kids doing this kind of instruction and learning anytime you have snow.”
Schools in Owsley County, where 90 percent of the students qualify for free or reduced lunch, missed 30 days because of snow last year. Owsley officials say they embraced the program because interrupting schooling takes a disproportionate toll on high-risk students.
“It is going to impact us more if we don’t do something.” said Tim Bobrowski, the county’s school superintendent.
However, relying on the internet to connect with students on these un-snow days might not be that easy. Again from the AP:
Coping with fierce winter weather by teaching over the Internet has become more common in recent years, but it’s harder in states like Kentucky, which ranks 46th out of 50 states for availability of high speed Internet. The problem is most pronounced in rural counties, which is why the state is moving forward with a $200 million plan to lay 3,000 miles of fiber-optic cables.
Related: Growing Internet access opens the door to virtual school days
WKYT also reports that school staff will still need to be at the school on a snow day, giving the students an easy way to get in touch with teachers.
It’s not entirely clear how these days aren’t going to end up being snow days for the students, even if the schools aren’t counting them against a quota. Isn’t another term for “snow packets” just simply “homework?” And wouldn’t students need to complete their homework assignments the night before school resumed, anyways?
It’s also a little disconcerting that teachers and staff would be required to commute to school in potentially dangerous conditions, even if the children weren’t.
What do you think? Tell us in the poll, and feel free to elaborate in the comments.

"You'll be okay, probably." Satirical state ad aims to lure millennials into signing up for health
A new ad campaign from Illinois is making fun of a no-insurance mindset to try to get young adults to sign up for health insurance, using the tag line, "You'll be okay, probably."

The ads, which show young people cavorting around Chicago in cardboard splints and other homemade remedies, promote a fictitious "Luck Plan." The 30-second spots aired on network television in Illinois this week, the first week of open enrollment under the Affordable Care Act. The campaign targets millennials, whose participation in insurance is important to the health law's success but who have been more reluctant than others to sign up.
The ads, developed by Downtown Partners Chicago, are based on recent research, said Jose Munoz, chief marketing officer for Get Covered Illinois, the state's enrollment arm.
"To get people's attention you have to do one of two things — you have to be extremely funny or extremely offensive," Munoz said. "We went with funny."

A Groundbreaking New Law For Retail WorkersA Landmark Retail Workers 'Bill of Rights' Passes Unanimously In San Francisco

Amid growing concern over erratic work schedules, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors on Tuesday passed a first-of-its-kind law aimed at securing more stable hours for retail workers.
Dubbed " the retail workers bill of rights ," the law, which passed the 11-member, all-Democratic board unanimously, requires the city's large chain retailers to post workers' schedules at least two weeks ahead of time. Workers will be owed supplemental pay if unexpected changes are made to their schedules, or if they're required to be "on call" and their shifts are suddenly canceled.
The law, championed by Supervisor David Chiu, also requires that the employers offer any extra hours they have to their current workforces, rather than bringing on more part-time or temporary workers.
Passed as a set of two bills -- the first sailed through last week, the second on Tuesday -- the law marks a significant victory for labor groups and other advocates for retail and low-wage workers.
At a time when minimum wage and sick leave proposals are proving extremely popular, backers of the San Francisco legislation hope similar measures will now pop up in other cities and perhaps even states. California and its cities often find themselves on the leading edge of progressive labor policies.
Ann O'Leary, head of the children and families program at Next Generation, a San Francisco nonprofit that pushed for the legislation, said the law was fashioned partly in response to retailers' use of on-call and just-in-time scheduling. Modern scheduling technology may help retailers cut costs and become more efficient, but it also makes workers' hours less reliable, she said.
"It's not the manager thinking about people's needs -- it's a computer looking at the data," O'Leary said. "In San Francisco there's a higher minimum wage, but some weeks you're getting 10 hours and others you're getting 25. It's very hard to figure out what you're doing in terms of family income."
O'Leary also said the legislation was meant to address recent economic trends. With the high unemployment rates of the recession and recovery, many more workers than usual found themselves underemployed, working part-time but wanting more hours. The number of these so-called "involuntary part-time" workers has gradually dropped as the economy has rebounded , but it's still far from from its pre-recession levels.
Although popular among city supervisors, the San Francisco measures were opposed by the city's chamber of commerce. As Politico reported, the lobby sent a letter to the board last week criticizing the crafting of the law as opaque.
"These ordinances were drafted in large part behind closed doors, with last minute changes that brought numerous other employers within the scope of the ordinances, without notice or outreach," the letter stated.
Backers of the legislation tried to make it more palatable to the San Francisco business community by carving out smaller employers. The law only applies to what city law considers " formula retail " companies, which are retail and food chains with 11 or more locations nationally. So while companies like Target and McDonald's will have to follow the law, the local corner store and mom-and-pop boutique will get a pass.
Despite the chamber's concerns, O'Leary said advocates didn't encounter much opposition to the proposal, probably because of how it was limited to larger companies.
"Since we moved from something that would cover the entire workforce to more formula retail chains, we haven't seen big resistance from the employer community," she said.
The coalition of groups supporting the law was hoping to raise standards in general at large chains, according to Michelle Lim, an organizer with the San Francisco office of Jobs with Justice, a non-union labor group focused on low-wage industries. Groups like Lim's have been instrumental in winning labor-friendly measures like San Francisco's through city councils as well as the ballot box.
"What a retail worker bill of rights could do is really lift the floor not just for retail workers but for chain businesses," said Lim. "It's also creating lot of opportunities for organizing."
The San Francisco bill already has a federal companion of sorts in Congress: the Schedules that Work Act . The legislation would require businesses to compensate workers who show up for their scheduled shift but are turned away, as well as workers whose schedules are changed without at least 24 hours' notice. Sponsored by House Democrats, the bill has virtually no chance of passing the GOP-controlled House or the soon-to-be-GOP-controlled Senate.
With Congressional Republicans opposing a minimum wage hike and other legislation aimed at low-wage work, labor unions and their progressive allies have found much more success on the local level. Despite the drubbing that Democrats took in the midterm elections earlier this month, binding ballot initiatives on the minimum wage passed easily in four red states . A measure that will require many employers to provide their workers with paid sick days also passed in Massachusetts.
Polling shows that voters are highly sympathetic to minimum wage raises and sick-leave mandates. O'Leary said she suspects scheduling rights for retail workers will prove popular as well, even in cities that aren't as famously liberal as her own.
"There are a lot of eyes on San Francisco now," she said. "People are wondering if we can bring this citywide, and then to the state level, and then around the country."

As UB Group continues to face growing shareholder activism, its Chairman Vijay Mallya today resigned as a director of group entity MCFL without assigning any reasons.
“Dr Vijay Mallya, a Director on the Board of Directors of the company, has resigned with immediate effect,” MCFL said in a filing to stock exchanges.
There was no reason given for the resignation, which came within days of minority shareholders of United Spirits rejecting 9 out of 12 resolutions, including those pertaining to pacts with entities connected to erstwhile promoter Mallya.

Citi bolsters Sensex target to 33 000 for Dec2015Crude turmoil, rouble rout spook India, world markets
Following the continued positive stock market momentum for the better part of 2014, Citi believes the upsurge to continue in 2015. The brokerage expects Nifty to touch 9850 and Sensex to hit 33,000 for December 2015. The gains, according to them, will be “front-loaded with falling rate gains, back-loaded with an actual economic/investment recovery; and accompanied by steady regulatory/execution reform”.
Citi economists say policy rates should fall 75 bps in 2015 – with downside risks to inflation and they believe the rate engine will fire now, and in early 2015.
Citi, however, cautions that economic / earnings fuel will likely stay cool, till mid-2015. With still modest near-term visibility (loan growth/pipeline, investments), corporate caution/discipline and regulatory reform still underway, a consistent economic/earnings uptick is only likely in mid 2015.
In a note to clients, the brokerage expect reforms to be a ‘sober, travelling companion’ rather than ‘big bang’ and that they believe will lend continue support to markets.
The factors that could act as speed bumps in the bull case scenario include high ownership, economic /governmental expectations and slightly expensive valuations a little over mean. But the greater risk they foresee is that the “rapidly falling commodity prices have started becoming too much of a good thing”.
Citi has re-worked their model portfolio to go overweight on banks, energy, cement and pharma.

Spices exports to sustain growth on tightnormsGold futures fall 1.13% on weak global cues
India’s spices exports are likely to sustain their growth momentum during next few years mainly due to enforcement of stringent pre-shipment quality checking norms, a Spices Board official said on Monday.
The mandatory pre-shipment checking through dedicated quality evaluation labs located in  Chennai, Delhi and Tuticorin  prior to exports of spices has ensured that number of ‘alerts’ relating to pesticides residue presence in Indian consignments from European Union and the United States has declined from 121 in 2010-11 to only 16 in the last fiscal.
“We are aiming at reducing such alerts to  negligible level in the next three years through using quality evaluation labs,” Spices Board chairman A Jayathilak told FE.
Jayathilak said these labs have been equipped to detect chemicals or pesticides like sudan dyes in chilli and turmeric powder, aflatoxins in chilli, ginger and tumeric and pesticide residues in cumin and chilli exports consignments.
Meanwhile, as per the official data, spices exports mainly consisting of chilli, mint, pepper and turmeric increased by 9% to R6,962 crore in the first six month of current fiscal in comparison to R6,364 crore reported in the same period last fiscal.
In volume terms, spices exports grew by 12% to 4,21,570 tonne during April-September period of this fiscal as against 3,76,584 tonne in the corresponding period of the previous year.
In 2013-14, chilli, cumin, turmeric, coriander and fenugreek accounted for more than 70% of the total volume of spices exports whereas mint, chilli, spice oils and oleresins and cumin account for around 70% of the total value of exports.
Chilli, which has largest share in the country’s spices exports rose to 1.6 lakh tonne worth  R1,547 crore during the period. The exports rose by 17% in quantity and 23%  in value terms.
Exports of mint and mint products (mint oils, menthol and menthol crystals) were worth R1,463 crore. Cumin exports stood at R977 crore.
Spices Board, which operates under the commerce ministry, has a mandate to promote exports of 52 spices in any form, including curry powder, oils, oleoresins and other spice mixes, where spice content is predominant. Besides exports development of spices, the board also looks after production of cardamom (small & large).
More than six million tonne of spices are traded in the country annually with estimated turnover of R60,000 crore. More than five million growers and traders are engaged in the spices trade.

United Spirits stock brushes aside shareholderalarmCrude turmoil, rouble rout spook India, world markets
The United Spirits scrip slipped over 8% in early morning trade on Monday before recovering to end the session 0.5% lower than Friday’s close. While most of the institutional shareholders that FE spoke to said they had not sold shares, they confirmed they had voted against several resolutions put to vote at the extra ordinary general meeting (EGM) on Friday. Of the 12 resolutions put to vote nine were not passed. Some fund managers said they voted against the resolutions as they believed these would  favour Vijay Mallya and put unnecessary financial burden on the Diageo-controlled United Spirits.
The fall in stock price, dealers said, may have been the result of profit-taking.
As per disclosures on the exchanges, institutional shareholders were instrumental in deciding the fate of the resolutions at the EGM. Of the 4.04 crore shares held by the institutions — both domestic and foreign — 38.86% of votes were polled, while of the 1.93 crore shares held by non-institutional shareholders, including HNIs and retail investors, 0.62% of votes were polled.
Among the special resolutions proposed at the EGM, a property maintenance services agreement with Kingfisher Finvest was disapproved as 77.17% of the votes were against the resolution. A fund manager speaking on conditions of anonymity said, “The loan arrangements and property maintenance services arrangements with other companies don’t make sense. We feel these transactions would put unnecessary financial burden on United Spirits.”
As per the latest annual report, the company paid R14 crore to Kingfisher Finvest towards ‘property maintenance fees’ in FY14. Among other resolutions, a loan arrangement with United Breweires (Holdings) was also disapproved.
Special resolutions were proposed for sponsorship agreement with United Racing and Bloodstock Breeders (URBB) and United Mohun Bagan Football Team. Both the resolutions were shot down.
Another fund manager said that while there was some uncertainty on the stock, the company was expected to do well in the long term.
Diageo holds 54.78% in United Spirits through its wholly-owned subsidiary Relay BV after it bought an additional 26% from public shareholders for R11,488 crore in July.

China-US trade pact puts pressure on India to fast track electronics manufacturingChina-US trade pact puts pressure on India to fast track electronics manufacturing
Surabhi Agarwal | New Delhi Dec 03, 2014 12:44 AM IST
The Narendra Modi government will have to intensify its efforts to promote local manufacturing of electronics to counter the possible fallout from the US-China trade pact that removes import tariffs on a host of new electronic items.
In the wake of the pact, which was signed last month, India is facing renewed pressure to sign the extended Information Technology Agreement (ITA).
India has been reluctant to sign the pact, saying the ITA will only be beneficial to the country when domestic manufacturing is robust.
Signing the agreement will also go against Prime Minister Modi’s Make in India push as it will make importing goods cheaper than manufacturing them locally. A government official said although India has lost China’s support in opposing the extended ITA, it will not sign it as yet.
“From the perspective of promotion of electronics manufacturing, it is not in our interest to sign,” the official said.
The first ITA was signed in 1997 and has not been reviewed since despite massive technological innovations and additions in the past 17 years. The official said even last time, all the countries did not sign the agreement in one go. The countries that are supporting the agreement are the first ones to sign, gradually building pressure on others to come on board.
“Only if we expand exports and local manufacturing is the ITA in our interest”, said the official, adding “So, it puts pressure (on us) in the sense that in the next two years we have to develop manufacturing.” There are signs of local production picking up, he noted.
Under the first phase of ITA, almost all prominent electronic items were covered and import duties on them were removed by all member countries so the import costs go down. However, the decision to sign the agreement is often considered to be one of the reasons for India’s lacklustre domestic electronics manufacturing ecosystem.
The official said despite the past debacle, India would like to sign the agreement, as it would give local firms access to a huge market.
The agreement covers 200 new tariff categories covering $1 trillion in global sales trade, according to the US government. It is also expected to create as many as 60,000 jobs in the US and increase global annual gross domestic product by $190 billion, according to a White House fact sheet.
In a recent interview to Business Standard, Arun Kumar, assistant secretary of commerce for global markets and director-general of the US and Foreign Commercial Service, had said: “We want to have low tariffs on information technology projects all over the world, it is all about being competitive and having choices.”

Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti apologises after PM Modis warningBJP minister apologises after PM Modi’s warning
Yahoo India –  Tue 2 Dec, 2014
New Delhi: Minister of State in the BJP-led government Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti has apologised in the Parliament over her controversial "Muslims, Christians sons of Ram" remark.
However, the Congress has sought her resignation, calling this apology "too little too late".
Her apology comes after PM Narendra Modi asked his ministers to refrain from addressing the nation.
"I will not compromise on any such behavior," PM Modi reportedly said in a meeting of BJP MPs this morning, without taking any names.
Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, who came under strong criticism for using an abusive language while addressing voters in a campaign, had earlier defended herself saying that she did not mean to target any particular person or party but separatists.
"I did not take name of any particular individual, community or party. I was talking about separatist parties and leaders who think of dividing the country and who do not consider themselves to be a part of India," said Jyoti.
Earlier on Monday, the union minister had used abusive words to urge voters to choose between candidates, while addressing voters in west Delhi's Shyam Nagar.
Her choice of words garnered strong criticism from various political parties.

Memo to McDonald s: The Climate Deserves a Break Todayreddit
In the fall of 1960, my parents took my little brother and me to the first McDonald's in the Cleveland area. It looked like a spaceship, with bright yellow arches on either side of a gleaming white building adorned with red, horizontal stripes. In front was the chain's signature sign topped by Speedee the Chef -- Ronald McDonald's predecessor -- holding a neon placard emblazoned with "15¢," the price of a hamburger.
Needless to say, my brother and I were very excited. Sure, we'd been to Royal Castle and Manners Big Boy, but McDonald's seemed a lot cooler.
After sampling one of those flash-frozen, 15-cent burgers, however, I wasn't lovin' it. On the way out of the parking lot, I distinctly remember saying to my parents, "That place is never going to make it."
Boy, was I wrong.
A half century and untold billions of burgers later, McDonald's is the world's most profitable fast-food chain. In 2012, its 12,600 U.S.-based restaurants alone boasted $35.6 billion in sales -- nearly three times more than its nearest competitor, Subway, which has twice the number of U.S. outlets. Meanwhile, McDonald's 18,700 restaurants in more than 100 other countries grossed nearly $45 billion . The chain now serves more than 70 million people every day.
It's no secret that McDonald's global reach has had a huge impact on diet, prompting more than 3,000 health professionals and institutions worldwide to sign on to a letter urging the company to stop marketing junk food to children. Less known, however, is Mickey D's supersized impact on the environment, especially when it comes to global warming. Besides the fact that the chain sells a lot of beef, which is by far the worst meat for the climate, it's one of the top 10 largest users of palm oil, the world's most popular vegetable oil -- and a major source of carbon emissions.
Palm Oil Plantations Are Destroying Tropical Forests
Americans are likely more familiar with canola, olive and other vegetable oils, but palm oil -- which comes from the flesh of the oil palm tree's fruit -- is ubiquitous. Along with palm kernel oil -- which comes from the fruit's seeds -- it turns up in baked goods, packaged foods, personal care products and cleansing agents. In addition, it's a common cooking oil in developing countries, and used to make biodiesel fuel worldwide.
In and of itself, palm oil is not a bad choice. It's cheap, largely because growers can produce five to 10 times more vegetable oil per acre than from any other commercial oil seed. It is also one of the few naturally saturated vegetable oils, which makes it solid at room temperature and affords it a long shelf life. And it contains no trans fats, which have been linked to heart disease.
That's the good news. The bad news is oil palm trees only grow in the wet tropics and, all too often, producers destroy tropical forests to plant them. Most of these plantations -- about 85 percent -- are in Indonesia and Malaysia. Clearing tropical forests, which contain enormous amounts of carbon, releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Some Southeast Asian palm oil plantations also devastate critical habitat for elephants, orangutans, rhinoceros and tigers. Still others grab land from local communities or exploit child labor.
And if that weren't bad enough, some palm oil plantations wipe out peatlands, which are wetlands topped with a thick water-logged layer of dead and decaying plant material. Peat soils store 18 to 28 times more carbon than tropical forests, and they can be as much as 60 feet deep. Dry peat is extremely flammable, and one of the ways producers clear land is by burning it, which sends tons of carbon dioxide and toxic pollutants into the atmosphere.
Palm oil plantations deforested some 6,100 square miles in Indonesian Borneo between 2000 and 2010, according to a 2012 study in Nature Climate Change.
International Efforts Are Beginning to Pay Off
In 2004, palm growers, processors, traders, consumer goods manufacturers, retailers, investors, and environmental and social justice organizations established the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) to develop voluntary standards to protect tropical forests. The organization now has more than 1,600 members, which represent 40 percent of the palm oil industry.
RSPO standards address a number of key issues, such as pesticide use and labor conditions, but don't go far enough to protect the climate. RSPO certification, for example, still allows producers to clear forests and peatland to create or expand plantations. Only pristine, or "primary," forests are off-limits. The standards also don't restrict carbon emissions from plantation development. They only offer guidelines for reporting emissions from forest conversion.
Equally problematic, RSPO standards allow companies to buy inexpensive credits, called "GreenPalm" certificates, in lieu of buying RSPO-certified oil. The proceeds from the sale of those credits go to RSPO-certified palm oil producers, but the revenue generated doesn't remotely cover the true cost of ensuring that the palm oil is produced responsibly. In other words, GreenPalm certificates -- which may have made sense 10 years ago -- allow companies to claim they're doing something when they're still buying palm oil that may very well come from plantations that destroyed forests.
Over the last decade, Amnesty International, Greenpeace, Rainforest Action Network, the Union of Concerned Scientists, World Wildlife Fund and others have been shining a light on unethical palm oil production and pressuring producers and consumers -- which include some of the world's largest food and cosmetic companies -- to commit to ending forest destruction and social abuses.
In November 2012, scientists from leading academic and research institutions worldwide weighed in, issuing a statement calling on the RSPO to strengthen its standards. Ultimately signed by more than 200 scientists, the statement urged the organization to completely ban palm oil development on peatland and "high carbon stock forests," including "secondary forests," which are forests that have recovered after being logged.
A year later, four RSPO producers -- Agropalma in Brazil, Daabon in Colombia, New Britain Palm Oil in Papua New Guinea, and Golden Agri-Resources, Indonesia's largest palm oil producer -- joined with a handful of environmental and social justice groups to launch the Palm Oil Innovation Group to promote "ambitious standards that stretch" RSPO guidelines. "We are building a strong case that palm oil does not need to be linked to forest destruction and exploitation," POIG said in a November 13, 2013, statement . "From producers and traders, through to palm oil consumers, we are creating an approach that can be replicated across the industry, and which will increase demand for responsible palm oil."
These efforts, coupled with pressure from millions of people around the world, have spurred a dramatic turnaround. Last December, the world's largest palm oil trader, the Singapore-based Wilmar International, pledged to stop selling palm oil linked to deforestation or peatland development. Following Wilmar's announcement, vegetable oil giants Bunge and Cargill fell in line. Add Golden Agri-Resources, and they represent more than half of the global palm oil trade. Public pressure also has prompted L'Oréal, Nestlé, Unilever and other major corporate palm oil consumers to commit to completely eliminating deforestation from their supply chains. And in September of this year, 34 corporations joined national governments, indigenous peoples and nonprofit advocacy organizations to sign the nonbinding New York Declaration on Forests at the U.N. Climate Summit, vowing to cut deforestation in half by 2020 and ending it in 2030.
McDonald's Do-Nothing Palm Oil Policy
This rush to embrace climate-friendly principles was hastened by a March 2014 Union of Concerned Scientists report analyzing top U.S. brands' palm oil policies. UCS rated the 30 largest companies in the packaged-food, personal-care and fast-food sectors on their commitments to use deforestation-free, peat-destruction-free palm oil that is traceably and transparently sourced. Packaged-food companies had the strongest commitments. Fast-food companies, on the other hand, had the weakest.
And that brings us back to McDonald's.
McDonald's, an RSPO member and a signatory to the New York Declaration on Forests, received the second highest score among the 10 fast-food chains in UCS's survey, just behind Subway. But that's not saying much. McDonald's earned only 21 points out of a possible 100, a failing grade no matter how you slice it. The other eight, including Burger King, Wendy's and Yum! Brands -- parent company of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell -- all rated a zero.
According to the most recent report McDonald's filed with the RSPO, the company used 103,336 metric tons of palm oil in 2012. Less than 13 percent of that oil --13,000 metric tons -- was RSPO-certified, and the company claimed nearly a quarter of that oil -- 3,000 metric tons -- by purchasing GreenPalm certificates.
McDonald's goal, as the company explains on its U.S. website, is for 100 percent of its palm oil to be "verified as supporting sustainable production by 2020." How does it plan to do that? By buying more RSPO-certified palm oil, which is not guaranteed to be deforestation-free, or purchasing more GreenPalm certificates, which at most provide a fig leaf for continuing to buy palm oil associated with deforestation.
Contrast McDonald's do-nothing policy with that of Dunkin' Brands, the parent company of Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins. The company was one of the eight fast-food chains that scored zero in UCS's review of U.S. corporate palm oil commitments, but since then it has taken a 180-degree turn.
In September, Dunkin' Brands announced it would buy only 100 percent deforestation-free palm oil by 2016, which goes way beyond McDonald's support for inadequate, outdated RSPO standards. Among other things, Dunkin' said it would ensure that its suppliers protect forests and peatland as well as cut carbon emissions from existing plantations.
"Sourcing even limited amounts of palm oil irresponsibly can contribute to deforestation, loss of natural habitats, and other environmental and human rights concerns," said Christine Riley Miller, Dunkin' Brands' senior director for corporate social responsibility, in a September 16 press release . "Therefore, Dunkin' Brands has created clear guidelines for our suppliers, and to ensure independent verification that our principles are being met, so that by 2016 we can meet our targets of sourcing only responsibly produced palm oil."
Besides Dunkin' Brands, eight other companies -- ConAgra, Colgate-Palmolive, Danone, General Mills, Kao, Kellogg's, PepsiCo and Procter & Gamble -- either initiated or strengthened their palm oil policies after UCS called them out in its scorecard. Those conversions, however, wouldn't have happened without a great deal of nudging. Take Dunkin' Brands' change of heart, for example. UCS and other groups, including Forest Heroes and SumOfUs, inspired tens of thousands of people to contact the company, and Forest Heroes even staged a demonstration outside of its annual shareholder meeting in May. Dunkin' Brands took note, and just a day after its mid-September announcement, one of its main competitors, Krispy Kreme, announced it also would upgrade its palm oil policy.
If those corporate Goliaths can make the switch, surely public pressure can persuade McDonald's -- as well as Burger King and Yum! Brands -- to do the right thing, too. Want to help? You can join UCS's campaign by sending a message to McDonald's and other fast-food laggards by clicking here . Tell McDonald's the climate deserves a break today.

71% polling in 2nd phase in J&K polls71% polling in 2nd phase in J&K polls
Press Trust of India | Srinagar/Jammu Dec 03, 2014 12:42 AM IST
In a re-run of record polling in the first phase, a 72 per cent voter turnout was registered in the second phase of incident-free Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir on Tuesday with people again ignoring boycott calls by separatist groups and braving chilly weather.
Election commission officials said the figure for the polling in 18 constituencies in five districts — two in the Valley and three in Jammu — could go up a little once the final tally is available.
Dealing a serious blow to separatist politics, enthusiastic voters stood in serpentine queues at several polling stations waiting for their turn after they walked in fog and cold.
The first phase of the five-phase polls for 15 seats on November 25 had witnessed a record 71.28 per cent polling.
Election Commission officials said tonight that according to latest updates voting had touched 72 per cent.
Deputy Election Commissioner Vinod Zutshi at a press conference in Delhi shortly after the conclusion of polling in the evening said there was a 71 per cent turnout and that it could go up by two per cent.
Zutshi said during the entire phase there was “no untoward incident” and the entire poll process was peaceful.
“There was no incident that vitiated the poll process in the state during this phase,” he said, adding that “pretty heavy” voting was reported in Reasi and Udhampur districts.
Tuesday’s poll percentage, the Deputy EC said, is higher than 61.04 per cent polled during the 2014 Lok Sabha polls and 68.79 per cent recorded during the 2008 Assembly elections.
Voters came out in large numbers in Kulgam district (over 60 per cent) in the Valley unmindful of the back-to-back attacks by militants on two sarpanches over the last two days in adjoining Shopian district. The attacks led to the death of one sarpanch on Sunday night. There was a tight security cover in Kulgam and Kupwara districts.
The corresponding figures for voting today in the other four districts were: Reasi (80 per cent), Udhampur (76 per cent), Poonch (75 per cent) and Kupwara (68 per cent).
Zutshi said the weather was “very supportive” during the polls and there was no snowfall. The phase involved an electorate of 15.35 lakh. A total of 175 candidates, including four sitting ministers and 11 other sitting MLAs were in the fray.
Of the 18 constituencies, Handwara in north Kashmir's Kupwara district was in focus as separatist-turned-mainstream politician Sajad Gani Lone is making a debut in Assembly elections after unsuccessfully contesting the Lok Sabha polls in 2009.
Although the cold weather conditions and heavy fog posed a hindrance in some areas in the early hours, voters started flocking the polling stations as the day progressed and the sun came out.
In Jammu, the state's Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) Umang Narula told reporters that there were 4 polling booths where there has been zero poll turn out due to some local issues in Kulgam district.

After eating into Apple s share in China  Vivo sets eyes on IndiaAfter eating into Apple's share in China, Vivo sets eyes on India
BS Reporter | New Delhi Dec 03, 2014 12:45 AM IST
Vivo, a brand of BBK Communication Technology that makes smart devices such as 4G Xshot handset, is now set to enter the fastest-growing smartphone market in India with the first launch planned later this month.
Last quarter, it sold more smartphones in China than Apple did.
From about a two per cent share in Chinese market, Vivo has jumped up to capture six per cent (Canalys report) by the end of September 2014 to emerge the sixth largest smartphone company in China, as Apple dropped to the seventh position in the world’s largest smartphone market. Vivo was at 11th spot last year.
“Vivo was launched in China in 2011 and we started entering the other markets only this year. We will bring four-five models in India in the first year with a price range between Rs 7,000 and Rs 40,000. Of the first lot, at least three will be priced above Rs 20,000,” said Jacky Liao, director, Vivo Mobile India.
While the company will import devices in the initial years, Liao said the firm will establish its manufacturing unit in India over the next three years. “We’ll start looking for location and finalise plans in details sometime next year,” he added.
Vivo, which sells about three million units a month in China, has also entered Thailand, Indonesia, Malyasia and Myanmar, besides India. The company has plans to enter about 100 markets outside China. In India, it has inked pact with 20 distributors in 20 states, and the number will go up to 25 over the next year.
The company has also entered into a partnership with Viacom18 Integrated Network Solutions, which will provide marketing and communications support for building brand Vivo in India. The partnership with Viacom18 is not just for India, and it also supports Vivo in other markets.
As part of its mandate, the Viacom18 entity will put to use large impact live properties and genres such as music to comedy catering to various target audiences, and also key broadcast properties of the network across brands, the company said in a statement. All other marketing and brand communication activities will also be conceived and executed by Viacom18 Integrated Network Solutions, it added.
“The collaboration opens new avenues for media conglomerates to go beyond the perception of being a mere vehicle for advertisement. With a network like ours – with multi-screen, multi-platform, multi-regional presence - that caters to Vivo’s core TG of 18 to 34, we make for an ideal partner to provide complete brand solutions,” said Sudhanshu Vats, group chief executive officer, Viacom18 Media. The association between Vivo and Viacom18 will be across broadcast and live platforms in the youth, music, and comedy genres with Brand such as MTV, Vh1, Comedy Central and Colors.

During the holiday season, many of us are flooded with phone calls and letters requesting contributions to various charitable organizations—and we respond. About 95 percent of households donate to charities, averaging about $3,000 per household contribution, according to the  National Philanthropic Trust .
Charitable giving is one of the top financial priorities of many individuals and families, along with saving for retirement and college.
"We hear very consistently that it's an important element of their financial planning," said Fidelity Investments' Kathleen Murphy, who oversees $1.7 trillion in assets as president of the firm's personal investing business. "Almost regardless of the affluence they have, people want to give back."
But when people give, they should be certain that the charity isn't a scam and that the contribution—big or small—will have the greatest impact. Here's a checklist to make sure you're choosing a charity wisely.
1. Find a charity whose mission you believe in. 
If it's a local nonprofit or a national organization with programs in your community, you can volunteer your time or go in person to see some of the programming in action. Check out the company's website as well as independent reviews and evaluations.
2. Make sure it's a legitimate, reputable charity.
Verify that it is a tax-exempt organization registered with the Internal Revenue Service by reviewing its  Form 990 .
3. Determine how your donation will be used.
GuideStar ,  CharityNavigator ,and  CharityWatch are a few websites that will give you an overview of an organization's financial health and budget breakdown.
4. The typical charity spends 75 percent of its budget on programs, according to CharityNavigator.Look for nonprofits that hit or come close to the benchmark.
The rest of a typical charity's budget goes to administrative costs (15 percent) and fundraising (10 percent).
CharityWatch delves a bit deeper into an organization's fundraising and other accounting practices, including how much is spent to raise each $100 of funds that are collected.
5. Also, be sure to assess the impact of the charity's work. 
GiveWell does in-depth research on programs that it determines have had the most impact on people's lives and then suggests a handful of charities it deems best at delivering these programs. It also suggests questions that you should ask a charity to evaluate whether the organization is actually "doing good" and having a measurable effect.
6. If you don't have time to do the research and can't decide which charity to choose, you can still make a tax-deductible charitable contribution to a donor-advised fund. It's like a charitable savings account.
You can contribute to the fund as often as you'd like and recommend grants to your favorite charity when you're ready. A number of investment firms, including Vanguard,  Charles Schwab and  Fidelity , offer donor-advised funds.

Nigerian cooking pops-up in Northeast this weekendBy Maura Judkis December 2 Follow @MauraJudkis
The key ingredients to Nigerian food, according to chef Tunde Wey, are "A lot of wit, a lot of jokes."  The Detroit-area chef will be bringing those -- as well as jollof rice , egusi , isi ewu , abacha , and other dishes from his Nigerian heritage -- to dinner at Mess Hall on Saturday and Toki Underground on Sunday. Wey, who moved to the U.S. when he was 16, co-owns Revolver, a pop-up dining venue in Detroit. He's on a tour of eight U.S. cities; he's calling the dinner series Lagos , after the largest city in Nigeria.
Tunde Wey (Courtesy of Tunde Wey)
Wey has been cooking huge family-style meals of traditional Nigerian dishes, utilizing ingredients such as goat heads and stewed cow feet. He wants to introduce Nigerian cooking to Americans in a way that doesn't "peddle tired stereotypes or gimmicks; none of that 'coming-to-America-mud-cloth-and-zebra-print-wearing-spear-chucking-natives-in-ceremonial-masks' going on here," he wrote on the supper club's site.
"I’m no means representative of 150 million people. This is my unique perspective," he said.  "I just want people to come out to a dinner and have a good time, meet people, vibe."
Wey talked with The Post about what guests can expect to eat, why he's hesitant to describe it, and why you'll like it, even if your smartphone camera doesn't.
Nigerian food is not monolithic. "Nigeria is a colonial construct . When I’m saying Nigerian food, I’m really only cooking food from Yoruba and Igbo [cultures]," said Wey. Ethnic groups throughout the region may have dishes in common, but utilize different flavors and technique. "They all share a similar taste profile," he said.
Nigerian dishes by Tunde Wey (Courtesy of Tunde Wey)
Nigerian food isn't pretentious, either. "Nothing is being deconstructed, foamed, jellified, gelatinized whatever. It’s just really honest food."
Even if Wey could describe Nigerian food to you, he wouldn't. "I don’t think there is vocabulary for the flavors that are Nigerian food," he said. "Part of what I’m trying to do is to be as least descriptive as I can, because for me it’s my response to what I think is the current food philosophy, or foodie preoccupation with flavors, and parsing a meal into constituent flavors and understanding the terroir or mouthfeel or whatever. I tell people it’s going to be delicious and there’s no mistaking what’s going to be in your mouth." He continued: "I think people have glamorized subtleties of flavors. Bold flavors seem to have fallen from grace. Nigerian food is about bold flavors. When you eat a dish I make, you know exactly what happened. You know it’s spicy, rich ... there’s no investigation necessary."
The building block of Nigerian cuisine, according to Wey: "Bouillon cubes ... That [expletive] is the bomb." Other critical ingredients include palm oil, curry powder, ground crayfish and calabash nutmeg.
He hasn't had any trouble getting guests to eat goat head. "Part of what I’m trying to do is normalize and contemporize West African traditional food," Wey said. "My approach is to disabuse people of any fetishes they have about food that is different."
Wey has no formal training, but he comes from a family of culinary talent. "Of all of my family members that I know, I’m probably the worst cook. But I’m the best Nigerian cook an American would ever meet."
It will not look good on Instagram. Many Americans, said Wey, think of beautiful food as "A white plate and a tweezer amount of corn and some jus of some green paste, and some nice thinly sliced meats." The colors and textures of Nigerian food, though, don't fit that mold. "Food comes in many shapes and sizes, and they’re all beautiful," said Wey. But if you must: He recommends the X-Pro and Lo-Fi filters.

9 p.m. Saturday, Dec. 6 at Mess Hall, 703 Edgewood St. NE. $85, including drinks. Tickets available here .
6:30 p.m. Sunday, Dec. 7 at Toki Underground, 1234 H St. NE. $55. Tickets available here.

#Shirtgate inspires a Kickstarter for shirts covered in (science) ladiesBy Rachel Feltman December 2 Follow @rachelfeltman
STEM: Women are all over it (Elly Zupko)
Want to support women in science? Put them all over your torso . A recently-launched Kickstarter aims to make T-shirts covered in the faces of the greatest women in science history. The idea is to remind the public who these women are, and to give young women the sense that being a female science star is cool -- plus, proceeds will go to support women in STEM .
But the inspiration for the campaign came from a very different kind of shirt.
Maybe you were offended by that shirt covered in scantily-clad women that was worn in mission control during the Rosetta comet landing livestream. Maybe you were offended by the people who were offended by it . Maybe you have no idea what the big deal is, either way.
But whatever you think of the whole #shirtgate debacle, the fact remains: Women are under-represented in science, technology, engineering and math. And anything we can do to make these fields more welcoming to women is a great thing. So one woman is working on swapping out a bad shirt for a good one.
Elly Zupko , a Baltimore-area artist and writer, wasn't amused when she saw Rosetta scientist Matt Taylor's choice of apparel -- but she wasn't too concerned at first.
"My first reaction wasn’t that it was insidious or malicious, but that some guy had done something kind of dumb," Zupko said. "Honestly, I felt bad for the people he works with who had to deal with it. It was the kind of 'little thing' that wears on you over time when you’re a woman in a professional environment. But I know it’s worse for women in STEM fields, which have historically been — and currently are — dominated by men."
But when she realized that Taylor was a prominent scientist with a very public platform -- an internationally streamed news briefing -- it struck her that the shirt was more than just a dumb mistake.
"It was a message being broadcast to impressionable people, including students — and that message was negative. I also realized that the mistake wasn’t just Dr. Taylor’s. No one on his team, nor anyone at ESA, stopped him from publicly displaying sexualized imagery that was incredibly unprofessional, distracting  and inappropriate for his environment and audience," she said.
So Zupko tweeted a revision:
there, I fixed it pic.twitter.com/Z3gZQGh4GE
— Elly Zupko (@SMLXist) November 13, 2014
But what started as a joke is now about to be a reality: People asked Zupko if she planned on making the shirt and selling it, but with a book in the pipeline and a wedding to plan, she demurred. Until someone suggested that the proceeds could go to a charity that helped women get into science.
"The idea went from 'what if' to 'let’s do this!' in one tweet," Zupko said.
Zupko's campaign isn't the only one inspired by #shirtgate. Another raised omore than $20,000 to buy scientist Matt Taylor a watch in support of his hard work on the Rosetta landing -- but at Taylor's request, the money will be donated to an organization that aims to get children interested in science .
While some have accused Zupko of profiteering or being uptight, she said, the response has been overwhelmingly positive.
The initial Kickstarter is a modest one -- backers can simply pre-order shirts, and the project only needs to hit a $5,000 goal for the first line of products (a Hawaiian shirt and a T-shirt) to get made and shipped. The only other reward available is at the $500 level, where you can nominate your own favorite notable woman in STEM. But the list is already extensive, including several women who were neglected while their male collaborators received Nobel prizes.
There may be other products once the initial goal is reached -- leggings and scrub tops are next on Zupko's list. And anything that doesn't go towards production will go to the National Girls Collaborative Project , which aims to get young women into STEM fields. Zupko emphasized that she's running the project as a volunteer. She's already in talks with retail outlets to pick up larger runs of the shirts, and plans to work with them to ensure that the sales continue to benefit women in STEM.
The project may have started as a cheeky rebuttal, but now Zupko has a greater cause in mind. "The purpose of making the shirt real is threefold: awareness, inspiration and change," she said.

Major power outage sweeps through downtown Detroit— Jamal Bransford (@VideoManJamal) December 2, 2014
Schools let out early, reported Fox affiliate WJBK . City Hall was evacuated and the City Airport’s power also went out, reported  ABC affiliate WXYZ . The Detroit People Mover transit system  also lost power .
Firefighters used radio to communicate with each other and firetrucks were moved out of garages so they could respond to calls as all stations lost power, officials said Tuesday. The 911 dispatch center never lost power, and police departments relied upon a back-up system, officials said.
A  DTE Energy outage map  showed the blackout was concentrated in downtown Detroit. WJBK reported about 100 customers were affected by the outages, and they were non-residential, public buildings.

Similar major outages hit downtown Detroit in 2013 , which also affected the Frank Murphy Hall of Justice and the People Mover. The city had to shut off power to a major portion of the power grid to fix a cable failure.
As part of its bankruptcy process, Detroit is transitioning from running the PLD to having DTE Energy run the grid — a handover that will take four years, Duggan said.
Over the summer, DTE Energy focused on inspecting the most error-prone circuits, with the inspection process expected to be completed next year, Duggan said. The circuit that failed this morning hadn’t been addressed yet, “but obviously it’ll become the focus of inspections right now,” the mayor said.
Inspecting circuits “will make an event like today far less likely to occur again,” Duggan said. “We will, for another few years, have some risk of this happening.”

Shares of Digital Ally DGLY   rocketed 46% to $18.83 and Taser TASR   climbed 6% to $23.34 Tuesday, adding on to Monday’s gains  after President Obama proposed spending $75 million to finance the purchase of body mount video cameras for cops.
The cameras, used by scores of law enforcement agencies, provide real-time video of engagements with suspects, and have become more popular among local and state agencies since Ferguson, Mo., police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed teen Michael Brown. Digital Ally CEO Stanton Ross told USA Today in August that inquiries over video surveillance products increased five-fold in the weeks following Brown’s August death.
For its latest quarter ended Oct. 30, the company said that 665 law enforcement agencies are testing or evaluating its FirstVU body cameras.
Shares traded below $4 a share pre-Ferguson. Digital-mania peaked Sept 2, when the stock  peaked at $33.59 before a sellofff pushed it below $10 by mid-October.
Taser, best known for stun guns, has had a less volatile – and mostly upward – ride on Wall Street. Shares climbed from a pre-Ferguson range of about $12.40 a share to  $24.44 in early Tuesday trading – a 10-year high.
Its latest order came last week from the Winston-Salem Police Dept., which is purchasing more than 600 AXON body cameras in addition to nearly 300 already purchased.

How powerful synthetic drugs will upend drug markets globallyBy Keith Humphreys December 2
A packet of Spice, a popular synthetic drug. Flickr user Matto Fredriksson , CC.
Keith Humphreys is a professor and director of mental health policy in the Stanford University Department of Psychiatry.  
In a 2011 raid, Slovakian police seized over 4 kilograms of a powerful opioid ; enough to cause over 2,000 fatal overdoses. But the opioid wasn’t heroin sourced from Afghanistan, Thailand, Iran or some other far away home of the opium poppy. The drug was far more powerful fentanyl, synthesized on the spot.
The Slovakia bust was a dramatic example of a European trend : Illicit drugs made from plants (e.g., cocaine, heroin) are being replaced in some national drug markets by those that are synthesized (e.g., methamphetamine, fentanyl). The U.S. has had a parallel experience in the past decade with the rise of illicit consumption of synthetic opioids and cannabinoids . If illicit drug markets continue to separate from an agricultural base, it would upend traditional understandings of drug markets and drug policy.
Relying on plants grown in far-off locales increases production prices for drug traffickers. Their product is vulnerable to bad weather, blight, wars, eradication efforts and in transit seizures. The speed at which they can produce drugs is captive to the growth cycle of cannabis sativa, coca and the opium poppy and the time required for long-distance transport. When illicit drugs are synthesized in laboratories close to market, all these risks, costs and constraints vanish. The cost-efficiencies of local, synthetic production would allow drug dealers to lower their prices, thus stimulating more use.
Some traditional approaches to drug interdiction would be obsolete in a drug market dominated by synthetic drugs. With drugs being created domestically, there would be little point in spraying Colombian hillsides or chasing down speedboats and airplanes in the Caribbean. On the positive side, the eclipse of international interdiction efforts would ease the understandable resentment of consumer nations among people in drug source and transit countries (e.g., Peru, Afghanistan, Mexico).
Domestic law enforcement would face new challenges in a synthetic-dominated market.
Most obviously, hiding a kitchen sink-based meth lab is much easier than hiding a field of coca plants. Complicating enforcement further, synthetic drugs can be altered at a molecular level by chemists such that they fall outside current legal definitions of prohibited substances. This is in fact already happening with a new, rising class of drugs called either “legal highs” or “new psychoactive substances”.
Law enforcement might be able to reduce synthetic drug supply by controlling precursor chemicals used in drug production. This approach can work -- putting ephedrine-containing cold medicine on prescription wiped out meth labs in Oregon , for example -- but some precursors are available in such bulk and have so many legal uses that controlling them would be daunting.
Given the economic and enforcement-evasion advantage of synthesizing drugs at market rather than creating thousand mile long agricultural production chains, why hasn't this transformation in drug markets happened long ago?
One of the effects of prohibition is to make industries less efficient , including in adopting innovations. When Apple wants customers to abandon old iPhones for the latest model, it conducts a huge press launch with a coordinated marketing campaign and worldwide product rollout. An illegal drug trafficking organization wanting users to supplant, say, cocaine with methamphetamine, has no such options.
Also, drug policy expert Peter Reuter of the University of Maryland points out that established drug users have narrowly defined preferences. “Even with the vast array of psychoactive substances, there is strong loyalty to the tried and true," he says. "Cocaine users in particular show little enthusiasm for trying new stimulants that would seem to provide even better experiences."
Addiction, by definition, narrows people’s focus and may therefore prevent many heavy users from switching to synthetics.
But every year a new cohort of mostly young people newly become drug users. If they start on synthetics they could come to show the same fealty to them that established users have for old line drugs, thereby converting illicit drug markets of the future to an utterly unfamiliar shape.

Shannon Sharpe offers the ultimate RGIII takeBy Dan Steinberg December 2 Follow @dcsportsbog
(Fox)
While there have been plenty of mid-stream season obituaries written for Robert Griffin III over the past week, there will be more, written at greater length, and with a greater range of topics. Some — like ours — will be incisive and thought-provoking and subtle. Others will be scalding in their hotness.
Shannon Sharpe, amazingly, has already offered the apotheosis of hot RGIII season obituary takes. During an appearance with Pat Kirwan and Vic Carucci on SiriusXM NFL Radio over the weekend, Sharpe hit every possible off-field critique in just a few minutes of talking: the branding, the endorsements, the family involvement, the playcalling lobby, the practice habits, the documentary, the Kentucky Derby, the Shanahan feud, the locker room relationships.
I mean, this is magisterial.
The Branding
“I’ve said this early on,” Sharpe said. “I felt that he was more concerned about building a brand instead of playing football. And maybe the worst thing that could possibly happen was being in the Andrew Luck draft. Because Andrew Luck was building his brand of football that he played on Sundays and Mondays. Robert Griffin was trying to sell sandwiches and trying to sell T-shirts and tennis shoes.”
The Offense
“Even though [Griffin] won rookie of the year, everybody was talking about how ahead of his time Andrew Luck was, because he was able to throw the ball from the pocket,” Sharpe said. “But what RGIII didn’t realize, Andrew Luck had played in a pro style system his whole life. So throwing from the pocket was nothing for him….And so [Griffin] says ‘Well this is what I want to do,’ but you’ve never done it before. You played in a spread system in high school, you played in a spread system in college, and you’re coming off an injury. And you want to just be able to say okay, I’m not running anymore, I’m not running the spread anymore, I’m throwing from the pocket. But you’ve never done it.”
The Distractions
“Look at what happened in the offseason when he had the surgery,” Sharpe said. “He did a documentary. He gets married. He goes on a honeymoon. He goes to the Kentucky Derby. Are you really really serious about football, or are you serious serious about what football can provide for you? Because there’s a difference in the two. The guys that are serious serious about football — your Peyton Mannings, your Tom Bradys — I’m not saying don’t advertise or do endorsements dollars. But there’s a time and a place for everything. And I think he jumped on that and said ‘Okay, this is what I want to do, but I don’t think he thought it through far enough.’ ”
The Family
“And for me, look, you’ve got to get your parents out of your business,” Sharpe said. “You’ve got to be a man. You’ve got to grow up. Mom, dad, I love you, but I’ve got to do this on my own now. This is what I’ve got to do. This is what’s gonna be best for my career. And I don’t see it happening.”
The Shanahans
“I said this before, I don’t know if any professional athlete has had a more dramatic rise and precipitous fall than what we’ve witnessed,” Sharpe said. “But what we’re seeing right now is that what Mike saw — because now you can’t blame Mike and Kyle. Well they don’t support him, they didn’t want him. Well here’s a guy that comes in and one of the reasons he got the job is because he said I can get Robert Griffin [going], look at what I did with Andy Dalton.
The Practice Habits
“See a lot of people mistake habit for hard work,” Sharpe said. “Doing something over and over again is not working hard. Just because you show up to work every day at 8:30 and you don’t have to be there until 9:30, don’t mistake that [for hard work]. And I don’t want fans who are listening to think well he shows up an hour early, he’s working hard. Nahhh. Nah nah nah. That’s habit. There’s a difference between the two.”
The Locker Room
“You can get in front of the media and say ‘Yeah, I’m working hard,’ ” Sharpe said. “You can’t do it in front of those other 52 guys in the locker room. You can’t fool your teammates, because they see you. They see you every day, and they see you more than your family sees you. So if you think you can fool those guys in that locker room? Nah.”

The nation's top CEOs trimmed their forecasts for sales and capital spending but boosted their hiring plans over the next six months, according to the Business Roundtable's fourth-quarter survey.
Corporate leaders also predicted the economy will grow a modest 2.4% next year, below the forecasts of many economists who expect the nation's gross domestic product to increase about 3% in 2015, up from 2% to 2.5% this year.
On a conference call with reporters, Randall Stephenson, chairman of the Business Roundtable and CEO of AT&T, said overhauling corporate taxes and immigration and providing President Obama greater authority to negotiate trade agreements are critical to fueling stronger growth.
Monthly Markets Checkup: 6 things for December
"The economy ended the year essentially where it started -- performing below its potential," Randall Stephenson, chairman of the Business Roundtable and CEO of AT&T, told reporters.
The economy is expected to slow in the current quarter after strong growth the previous two quarters offset weakness early in the year that was largely due to  harsh winter weather.
Seventy-four percent of the 129 CEOs surveyed expect their companies' sales to increase over the next six months, up from 73% in the third quarter. But 9% expect sales to decrease, also up from 7% the previous quarter.
The CEOs also pulled back their investment plans; 36% expect capital spending to increase, down from 39% in the third quarter.
Hiring plans, however, picked up. Forty percent of the CEOs surveyed said their firms' employment will rise the next six months, compared with 34% in the third quarter. The survey was conducted Oct. 22-Nov. 12.
Stephenson urged Congress to extend corporate tax breaks that are set to expire and pass broader corporate tax changes that would encourage companies to invest in the U.S. He also said Obama's planned executive action to help about 4 million illegal immigrants is insufficient, adding that  Congress should pass a sweeping immigration bill.
Congress, he said, also should grant Obama trade promotion authority, which would give the president the power to negotiate trade pacts that Congress could not amend or filibuster but would still have to approve.
Stephenson said slowing global economies, such as in the euro zone and China, "can have nothing but a suppressive effect" on U.S. corporate sales as U.S. exports slow. But  he downplayed the effects of a strengthening dollar, which makes the nation's exports more expensive for overseas buyers.
He also said tumbling oil and gas prices "can be nothing but positive" for U.S. corporations, such as his own, AT&T. "It's more money in consumers' pockets for smartphones and iPhones," he said.

IIT-Madras placement day 2: Flipkart offers highest number of jobsIIT-Madras placement day 2: Flipkart offers highest number of jobs
BS Reporter | Chennai Dec 03, 2014 12:44 AM IST
The second day of the placement season at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Madras on Tuesday saw e-commerce major Flipkart Internet Pvt Ltd recruiting 19 students — the highest offer so far this season. Citigroup firm Citicorp Services came in second with 18 job offers.
A total of 77 students were placed on Tuesday during the forenoon session. In all, as many as 235 IIT-Madras students were selected by various companies.
Eaton Technologies offered jobs to 14 students, while Intel Technology picked nine students. Inasra Technologies (Stayzilla.com) offered jobs to three students during the day. Students who received offer letters from one company were not eligible to attend another interview.
On Monday, a total of 158 job offers had been made between the forenoon, afternoon and the graveyard sessions. Sixty-four students were selected by multinational companies, both foreign and Indian. Investment banker Goldman Sachs hired 13 students on Monday, becoming the top recruiter on Day-1.
Day-1’s afternoon session on Monday witnessed 77 job offers being issued, while the graveyard session, conducted from midnight to 6 am, saw 17 job offers being handed over.
The number of companies registered to attend the campus recruitment at IIT-Madras this year has doubled, while the number of students opting for placement has come down from last year, according to an announcement by the IIT.
Samsung R&D Institute India, Bengaluru, came in second on Day-1 in issuing offer letters. It offered eight jobs, while Visa Inc and Microsoft offered seven jobs each and Shell India Markets recruited six students. ITC offered jobs to five students, The Boston Consulting Group to four, McKinsey & Company, Xerox Research Centre India and IBM Research India to three each and Auctus Advisors and Hindustan Unilever to two each. Works Applications Japan recruited one student.

This year, 1,391 students have registered for placement - which is far less than last year’s 1,435 students. However, the number of companies registered for recruitment has seen a jump from 372 in 2013-14 to 762 this year, out of the 1,000 invited.
Students have also opted for deferred placement for the first time this year, with 10 students opting for this. The deferred placement was announced last year, but there were no takers. Under the deferred placement programme, students who are pursuing business ventures on their own can sit for the interview next year.
The highest offer from a foreign company during the Day-1 recruitment was of $129,500 a year, while the highest offer from an Indian company was of Rs 30 lakh, according to sources.

Number of failures on rise  MLC wants system scrappedWritten by Dipti Singh | Mumbai |
Posted: December 3, 2014 1:47 am
Stating that the negative marking system of evaluation — recently implemented by the Directorate of Vocational Education and Training (DVE&T) — has affected results of several students studying at industrial training institutes (ITIs), the MLC of teachers’ constituency has written to the state education minister, requesting him to get the system scrapped.
According to DVE&T officials, overall results of the July 2014 exam came down by almost 25 per cent owing to the new rule and hundreds of students have managed to “just pass”.
The letter by MLC Ramnath Mote claims that in some colleges, the failure rate rose to a staggering 80 to 85 per cent, while it was 40 to 50 per cent in others. The pattern was introduced in August 2013 by the Directorate General of Employment and Training (DGE&T) in New Delhi and implemented by the state government in the July exam this year.
According to principals and college managements, exams were conducted in the annual pattern till 2013, and was converted to the semester pattern from February 2014. “There was a lot of chaos with the last minute changes in our exam schedule. To make matters worse, even the paper pattern was changed. After the July exam, we found out that they have introduced negative markings, which we were totally unaware of,” said Xavier Mendonca, a student of an institute at Bandra. “We’ll end up losing a year if the authorities don’t take this seriously and scrap this faulty marking system,” he added.
According to the new system, if a student answers four questions wrong, he or she will get negative marks for the fifth answer, even if it is correct. “The system is faulty and will discourage students opting for ITI. If need be, we will meet officials of DGE&T. But we will get this negative marking system scrapped,” said Mote.
Nearly 215 from a batch of 250 students had failed at an ITI in Borivli, claimed the management of the institute. “The directorate recently introduced a new marking system, which gives negative marking to students. This seems to have been the main issue behind students losing so many marks,” said an official from ITI, Borivali.
An official from Father Agnel Technical Institute in Bandra, said that even the syllabus has shifted focus from practical-based assessment to more emphasis on theory, defeating the purpose of the course. “In the July exam, we found out that many questions asked in the paper were not even part of the syllabus,” he added.

Cops watching  taxi  auto drivers will pay for refusing to ply short distancesPosted: December 3, 2014 1:41 am
By Rohit Alok
The traffic police has started deploying officers in civil clothes across the city to specifically penalise autorickshaw and taxi drivers who refuse to ply short distances. Senior officers said the recently-adopted tactic has proven to be effective in the traffic police’s drive against errant auto and taxi drivers.
“We began this initiative 15 days ago. We deployed one woman police constable and one man constable from each traffic police chowky in civil clothes. They would approach autorickshaw or taxi drivers and ask them to take them to nearby areas. If the drivers refused, they were taken to the concerned chowky and penalised,” said Dr B K Upadhyay, Joint Commissioner of Police (Traffic).
According to the Maharashtra Motor Vehicle Rules (MMVR), a fine of Rs 100 can be levied on an auto or taxi driver if he or she refuses to ply a customer. “On November 22, around 5 pm, I was penalised for not plying a short distance to VP Road from Mumbai Central station. I tried explaining to the officer that I did not have fuel, but he refused,” said taxi driver V Singh, who operates in the Mumbai Central area.
Upadhyay said the police were focusing on crowded areas outside suburban railway stations, where most of such incidents take place. “We don’t have a sound public transportation system. Some travellers depend on taxis and auto rickshaws to take them to their destinations. Drivers are breaking the law by refusing to ferry them,” he added.
The idea of enforcing traffic rules and penalising offenders in plainclothes was initially applied for all violators. However, this ended up causing more inconvenience than benefits.
“Most of the violators would end up with an argument with the officer, mainly because they refused to believe that the plainclothesmen were indeed police officers. This would often create a commotion and, more importantly, impede the work of the officer on duty,” Upadhayay said. He clarified that his officers are permitted to carry out their job in civilian clothing.
According to the police, while enforcing the drive, uniforms will not act as a deterrent for auto or taxi drivers, and there will be no long-term benefits as the drivers will simply look around for uniformed policemen before refusing a passenger.
“If we were in our uniforms, the drivers would oblige but not learn a lesson. By this method at least, we can create an impact,” said S P Patil, police inspector with the Byculla traffic division.
Senior police inspector A A Sheikh of the Colaba traffic division, admitted that though the tactic is unique and a success, there is a deficit of officers in his division to regularly implement the initiative — given the heavy traffic in his jurisdiction.
“Three to four persons are inadequate to carry out this operation in a place like south Mumbai. Penalising errant auto and taxi drivers is necessary, but it can’t be enforced regularly, especially around the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, where a majority of these violations are reported,” Sheikh said.

Handwara sees tough battle between Lone  ChoudharyWritten by Muzamil Jaleel , Bashaarat Masood | Handwara/ Kupwara |
Posted: December 3, 2014 1:30 am
The entire market was shut and there was hardly anybody on the street. But this time, the strike in Handwara wasn’t to mark a protest, it was for polling.
In fact, it was a sort of fair behind the walls of the compound of the local girls school. Men and women waited in queues for their turn to cast their vote. Cups of kahwa and salt tea was served with a variety of bread from local bakers. The turnout was 71 per cent.
The excitement in the constituency increased with People’s Conference chief Sajjad Lone joining the electoral battle. Lone and his National Conference rival Choudhary Ramzan are locked in an intense battle. While Choudhary is contesting elections in the name of development, Sajjad talks of “change”.
“He will bring a change here,” said Mohammad Shafi, a college student.
“Like others, he doesn’t talk of giving jobs. He (Sajjad) will bring big factories to Handwara. He will change the face of forgotten Kupwara districts,” says Shafi.
By 12.45 pm, 391 votes have already been polled. A large number of them are the first timers. “I am here to vote for Choudhary sahib,” said Omar Rashid, 18, a Class X student. “He has helped us a lot. He gave a (government) job to my father. My father told me to vote for him.”
Choudhary supporters say they have everything in the town — macadamized roads, a well-equipped hospital, schools and the Anganwari centres. The only thing they want from him is district status to the town. But Sajjad’s supporters want an end to Choudhary’s “tyranny”. “We want an end to Choudhary rule in Handwara,” says Abdul Gafar Banday, a retired engineer. Banday’s brother Mohammad Yousuf was killed by paramilitary forces in 2008. “I didn’t vote in last elections but today I am out to vote him (Choudhary) out”.
Of the 15.42 lakh electorate, 71 per cent exercised their right to franchise sealing the fate of 175 candidate in fray at 18 assembly constituencies that went to polls on Tuesday.
While Handwara was gripped in poll fervour, this euphoria was missing in Kupwara. Though 62 per cent voters cast their ballot, there was silence at the polling booths as people came, voted and left. Although Kupwara has a triangular contest between Law Minister and sitting NC legislator Saifullah Mir and PDP’s contender Fayaz Mir and Sajjad’s candidate Bashir Dar, the contest lacks a star power.
Meanwhile, festivity was at its peak outside NC leader and Social Welfare Minister Sakina Ittoo’s house at Damhal village in Noorabad constituency from where she is seeking re-election. PDP candidate Abdul Majid Padder also hails from the village but Ittoo’s supporters turned the village red with NC buntings and posters. “I can sacrifice my life for Sakina madam. She has done everything to help continued…

SRA scam in Bandra: ACB books principal secys  HDIL Group chairmanBy: Express News Service | Mumbai |
Posted: December 3, 2014 1:28 am
The Maharashtra Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) on Tuesday registered a case against Principle Secretary (Housing) Debashish Chakrabarty, Principal Secretary (Woman and Child Development) Ujjwal Uke, HDIL Group Chairman Rakeshkumar Wadhwan and several others in connection with an alleged Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) scam in Bandra.
According to ACB officials, the complainant owned a commercial space in the Motilal Nehru Nagar at Bandra (East). While the area was redeveloped under the SRA scheme by HDIL in 2005-2006, the complainant was excluded from the benefits of the scheme.
“The complainant was declared ineligible in spite of having had a shop in the area before the redevelopment project began and not given a commercial space in the building that was constructed in the area. However, other shopowners, who were ineligible, were given shops in the building. This was done in connivance with several government servants, where forged documents were submitted and more than the allotted area was used in the redevelopment,” said an ACB officer.
The complainant subsequently approached the sessions court and Special Sessions Judge S V Ranpise directed the ACB to take action in the matter under Section 156 (3) of the Criminal Procedure Code.
“Based on the court’s directions, we have registered an offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act and the IPC against Uke, Chakrabarty, Wadhwan, as well as the then additional collector of the area, the current office bearers of the Motilal Nehru Nagar Cooperative Housing Society, and 10 directors of the HDIL,” said the officer.
The case has been registered for cheating, disobedience of law and framing of incorrect documents by public servants, criminal breach of trust and forgery under the IPC as well as for abuse of position for pecuniary advantage under the PC Act.

Landowners refute govts claims  say no encroached landBy: Express News Service | Mumbai |
Posted: December 3, 2014 1:26 am
A day after Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis announced that the state government will acquire large tracts of encroached private land where owners have, over the years, failed to redevelop slums, two of the landowners on Tuesday termed the government’s claims as untrue.
Fadnavis had said that over 2,000 acres of land belonging to five of Mumbai’s largest landowners are occupied by four lakh shanties and that the state will initiate acquisition proceedings against each in case they do not come forward with proposals to rehabilitate the slums under the Slum Redevelopment Act (SRA).
SRA CEO Nirmalkumar Deshmukh had named five of Mumbai’s traditionally large landowners as those responsible for harbouring shanties on their plots. He had added that once acquired, the slum residents will be free to appoint a developer of their choice to implement the redevelopment scheme.
The list include land parcels belonging to FE Dinshaw Trust in Goregaon, AH Wadia Trust in Kurla, Mohammad Yusuf Khot Trust in Bhandup, VK Lal Investment Company Pvt Ltd in Dahisar-Borivli and Byramjee Jeejeebhoy pvt ltd in Malad.
Speaking to Newsline on Tuesday, spokespersons for Byramjee Jeejeebhoy Pvt Ltd and V K Lal Investment Co Pvt Ltd each pointed out gaping holes in the government’s version. A director with Byramjee Jeejeebhoy Pvt Ltd, which once owned 12,000 acre of land in Mumbai, but is now left with 1,000-odd acre, said: “To begin with, not an inch of our land is encroached upon. Moreover, we do not have any land in Malad, our plots are in Jogeshwari, Borivli and Lalbaug.”
Denying the charge that they have neglected their encroached land, an official of V K Lal Investment Co said: “We in fact specialise in slum redevelopment and have four to five ongoing SRA projects in Dahisar currently.”
The Nusli Wadia-administered FE Dinshaw Trust — Mumbai’s largest private land holder — refused to comment. Spokespersons for A H Wadia Trust and Mohammad Yusuf Khot Trust both accepted that parts of their land are encroached by slums, but said they will think of a course of action only once they receive any kind of notice from the government.
Despite attempts, Deshmukh was unavailable for comments.

Bhopal gas tragedy: 30 years later survivors tell their taleWritten by Milind Ghatwai | Bhopal |
Posted: December 3, 2014 1:26 am | Updated: December 3, 2014 1:06 pm
Zaharlal, 30
He was born during his mother’s effort to escape the leak, in an open  field near a crematorium
Born in the midst of poison, named after it
Zaharlal was so named because he was born the night poisonous gas leaked from Bhopal’s Union Carbide plant, and slumdwellers thought he would not survive. The delivery took place at an open field near a crematorium.
“I did not choose the name; I was too unwell. Others thought it up because they had to enter some name when surveyors came,” says Pano Bihari, who had moved to Bhopal from Orissa after marrying Bhodev in the 1970s, and who now lives with her family in Oriya Basti in Nishatpura.
“I never liked the name because people made fun of me. Jawaharlal would have sounded much better,’’ says Zaharlal, now 30.
Pano recalls the birth: “My eyes started burning as if someone had stuffed chilli into them. I was heavily pregnant and ran a few kilometres and collapsed. The women ensured the delivery. I cannot remember the exact circumstances.” She could not see for weeks and has no idea who took her to the hospital.
She recalls having had many foreign visitors, some of whom wanted to take Zaharlal away for treatment and research. “I gave him birth after inhaling poison. How could I let them take him away?”
There is, however, a discrepancy between records and claims. The date of birth on Zahar’s age school leaving certificate and mark-sheets, issued in Orissa, is not December 2, 1984. Zaharlal says his relatives had taken him to Kalahandi, where they apparently lied so that he could get admission in the first standard. Gangaram Bidgar, a volunteer in the Oriya Basti, vouches that Zahar was born that night and that he was one of those who thought about the name because it sounded appropriate.
In the eight-odd years since he returned to Bhopal, Zahar has not found a job. He says he works as a construction worker for Rs 250 to
Rs 300 a day.
Inhaled fumes a day after birth, still suffers
‘I didn’t even have a name’
She was a day old and her family of 12 had not even had time to name her when the gas leak drove them out of their small house. They boarded a truck to Parwalia, 20 km away. “We were packed like fish,’’ her mother Naeema says.
“For days I did not have a name.  When it came to registering my name someone just wrote Bai,’’ says Shabana, 30, now married in Guna to an advocate. She says her cousins teasingly called her Gas Kand for years.
Shabana got used to queuing up with her mother in hospitals for treatment.
“The gas took its toll on my mother’s vision and she still suffers from stomachache,” says the youngest of 10. She says all her three children have some ailment or the other. “My eldest is nine but continued…

Cop beaten to death by thief to be honoured with a statueWritten by Srinath Raghvendra Rao | Mumbai |
Posted: December 3, 2014 1:23 am
Constable Ajay Gawand of Dongri police station, who died after a brutal assault by a thief three weeks ago, will be commemorated with a statue and community hall named after him, both located across the road from the police station where he was posted.
Colleagues of Gawand, apart from superior officers have been raising money to create a permanent memorial for the slain constable near Dongri police station. Gawand, 43, was part of the detection squad of the Dongri police station and had been serving in the Mumbai Police since 1993.
“At first, we thought of commissioning a bust in Plaster of Paris, but realised that it would deteriorate with time. We have now decided to have a bust in bronze installed opposite Dongri police station. Gawand’s family has given us a good picture of his for the purpose,” said Ravindra Shisve, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Zone I.
The Mumbai Police is looking to fully fund the small project through contributions from the staff at Dongri police station and senior officers. “We are looking to raise about Rs 25,000 and hire a sculptor. It will be a small project for which we expect everyone to chip in a bit. We have already finalised the text we want to have etched below the bust. We hope to have it ready in a fortnight,” he said.
Once completed, the memorial to Gawand will be the first bust of a slain Mumbai Police personnel since the statues of those killed in the 26/11 terror attacks in 2008.
Immediately, there are plans to name a newly constructed community hall in Dongri after Gawand. “In the past year, we have completely transformed a barren patch of land opposite the police station and built a multipurpose air-conditioned community hall there. We plan to name it ‘Shaheed Ajay Gawand Smriti Sabhagruha’ and will invite Police Commissioner Rakesh Maria to inaugurate it in a fortnight’s time. The hall will be used to conduct meetings of the local mohalla committee among other events,” Shisve said.
Gawand was among a team of policemen to respond to a call of theft at the Bharat Petroleum building in Wadi Bunder on November 16. Histotry-sheeter Santosh Salvi had climbed to the roof of the building and was pelting stones at the policemen below.
Gawand then rushed ahead of his colleagues and onto the roof to confront Salvi alone. However, Salvi allegedly attacked him with a large wooden plank and continued to batter him on the head even after he fell to the ground.By then, other policemen had also reached the roof and overpowered Salvi, but Gawand was declared dead on arrival in J J  Hospital. Gawand had earned a reputation as a daredevil policeman, often confronting criminals without the assistance of his colleagues.

Conservative same-sex marriage proponents push for changes in Republican platform in South CarolinaBy Hunter Schwarz December 2 Follow @hunterschwarz

Representatives from the group Young Conservatives for Freedom to Marry are meeting with Republican leaders in South Carolina this week as part of a campaign across early primary states to change the GOP platform’s language on marriage.
“There has to be room in the party for people with both points of view,” Tyler Deaton, campaign manager for Reform the Platform, told The Washington Post in an interview.
Marriage for same-sex couples became legal in South Carolina last month , and is now legal in all early primary states like New Hampshire and Iowa. Deaton said the group hopes it can convince the party by 2016  to swap out five sections in the platform on marriage with new language.
“We’re starting this campaign very early,” Deaton said. “We’re trying to create the space for Republicans to step out on this issue.”
The proposed language says “marriage matters both as a religious institution and as a fundamental, personal freedom” and encourages “a thoughtful conversation among Republicans about the meaning and importance of marriage.”
“Because marriage — rooted in love and lifelong commitment — is one of the foundations of civil society, as marriage thrives, so our nation thrives,” the proposal reads . “We recognize that there are diverse and sincerely held views on civil marriage within the Party, and that support for allowing same-sex couples the freedom to marry has grown substantially in our own Party.”
Marco Nuñez, Jr., a member of the campaign’s leadership committee who’s previously worked on campaigns for presidential campaigns for George W. Bush and John McCain, called the platform language “very neutral.”
“We’re not trying to ram anything down anyone’s throat,” he said. “We’re looking for language that reflects the party I know and love. We’re just looking for language that all Republicans can agree on.”
Young Conservatives for the Freedom to Marry are meeting with lawmakers, college Republican groups and activists Tuesday and Wednesday throughout South Carolina, and have previously met with leaders in New Hampshire, Iowa  and Nevada.

But both indexes were well off their highs for the day, with consumer discretionary shares the biggest drag on the S&P, while the Nasdaq was lower. Shares of Amazon were down 2.5 percent.
The S&P 500 moved more than 40 points from its high of the day to its low.

Futures crumbled in early trading as the ruble neared 80 per U.S. dollar, down 21 percent. The Russian currency sharply pared its losses and was down about 3 percent, near 68 per dollar.
Brent crude fell as much as 4.2 percent but was last down 2.3 percent at $59.65 a barrel. U.S. crude, which fell as much as 4.1 percent, was last down 31 cents at $55.60.
Still the S&P energy index was up 1.6 percent, leading gains on the S&P 500, as investors snapped up beaten down shares. The index is down 15.6 percent for the year so far following a sharp selloff in oil prices since June.
"There were many, many stocks, especially in the energy sector that were just trading at absolutely ridiculous prices to their fair market valuation," said Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in Charlotte, Vermont.
At 1:43PM the Dow Jones industrial average rose 64.46 points, or 0.38 percent, to 17,245.3, the S&P 500 gained 5.82 points, or 0.29 percent, to 1,995.45 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 4.18 points, or 0.09 percent, to 4,600.98.
Chevron, up 2.6 percent, was leading the points advance in the sector. Chevron's forward price-to-earnings ratio was at 13.6 at the close on Monday, compared to the S&P 500's 16.1, meaning investors pay less for every dollar of Chevron's earnings than they do for the S&P 500 overall.
Among the top percentage gainers, Nabors Industries, up 7.6 percent, had a forward P/E of 8.6, while Denbury Resources' P/E was 8.9. Denbury rose 8.4 percent.
Market participants also said bets on the Federal Reserve's next move were giving stocks support. Fed officials will decide this week whether to make a critical change to their policy statement that would widen the door for interest rate hikes next year. In October, The Fed repeated that benchmark rates were unlikely to rise for a "considerable time."
CVS Health Corp rose 3.8 percent to $94.14 after issuing a strong 2015 forecast. 3M lifted its dividend and was the top points gainer on the Dow industrials with a 2.2 percent advance. Boeing, up 2.3 percent, was among the best performers after it raised its dividend and perked up its buyback program.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,841 to 1,188, for a 1.55-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,601 issues rose and 1,081 fell for a 1.48-to-1 ratio.

Rajan scores one for RBI s independenceRajan scores one for RBI's independence
Ishan Bakshi | New Delhi Dec 03, 2014 12:30 AM IST
The decision to hold policy rates, in the face of intense pressure from the finance ministry and industry, is likely to be unpopular with some sections of this country’s political and business elite. But actions of the central bank, as RBI governor Rajan has pointed out in the past, “will not be popular. The governorship of the central bank is not meant to win Facebook likes.”
With the political class often trying to influence their decisions, maintaining central bank independence is a challenge. Politicians, guided by short-term considerations to please their electorate, often end up ignoring the long-term ramifications of their actions, which central bankers have to be mindful of.
The independence of central bankers is contested across the world. The Bank of China isn’t politically independent. Brazil’s central bank chooses an inflation target jointly with the government. In Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has exerted pressure on the Bank of Japan to print money to get the economy going.
In India, according to the 1934 RBI Act, governments have the power to issue policy directions. But while past central bankers have managed to retain a degree of operational autonomy, in their 2013 study on global central banks’ transparency and independence, N. Nergiz and Barry Eichengreen have ranked RBI as one of the least independent central banks. According to the authors, the manner in which governors are appointed and the lack of independence in policy formulation are some of the reasons for the low score.
Economists like Eswar Prasad argue that central banks in developing countries attempt to limit politicians’ influence by adopting inflation targets for their monetary policy. With monetary policy explicitly guided by these targets it reduces the interference from the political class. In the Indian context, one of the first initiatives undertaken by Rajan was to move towards an inflation targeting regime. Consistent with his past arguments that “focusing on a single objective – low and stable inflation is ultimately the best way that monetary policy can promote macroeconomic and financial stability”, monetary policy is now guided by meeting the inflation target of 6 per cent by January 2016 that Rajan has explicitly laid out. By moving towards an inflation targeting regime, Rajan is clearly transitioning towards a regime that gives the central bank its independence.  
The case for a loose monetary policy is largely based on the superficial view that inflation is now firmly under control and that high interest rates are holding back investment. Further, with the government expected to cut its expenditure sharply in the coming quarters to meet its fiscal deficit target, lower rates, the argument goes, would propel private investment which would boost growth.
But rather than succumbing to pressure, Rajan has wisely opted to maintain a status quo on monetary policy, choosing to wait for conclusive evidence that inflation is firmly under control. The monetary policy statement clearly states that the “favourable base effect that is driving down headline inflation will likely dissipate and inflation for December (data release in mid-January) may well rise above current levels” and that “it is reasonable to expect some firming up of these prices (of food) in view of the monsoon’s performance so far and the shortfall estimated for kharif production.” Thus the decision to reverse the current monetary stance is premature.

Are IPL team owners set for a better run next seasonAre IPL team owners set for a better run next season?
Sounak Mitra | New Delhi Dec 03, 2014 12:46 AM IST
It has made cricket more popular than ever before and made players much richer — even those who could not qualify for the national cricket team — but the Indian Premier League (IPL), hit by scams in recent times, is yet to prove a good business move for its franchisees.
Even as the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and players have made good money, all but two team owners in the T20 cricket tournament continue to report losses.
The only exceptions are Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan’s Knight Riders Sports, the owner of the Kolkata franchise that has won the IPL title twice, and GMR Sports, which owns Delhi Daredevils. While Knight Riders Sports has been reporting profits consistently since 2011-12, GMR Sports reported its first profit in 2013-14 despite its team neither winning a title nor ever reached the final tie.
Knight Riders Sports has been the most successful franchisee, with net profits of Rs 10.42 crore, Rs 6.34 crore and Rs 9.18 crore in 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14, respectively. This was after it reported a net loss of Rs 11.28 crorere in 2010-11, according to details filed with the Registrar of Companies (RoC). The company’s revenue fell a little to Rs 129.48 crore in 2013-14 from Rs 138.65 crore the previous year.
GMR Sports has made its maiden profit, of Rs 7 crore, in 2013-14 — a sudden recovery from a loss of Rs 4.90 crore the previous year. Its revenue increased from Rs 151.11 crore in 2012-13 to Rs 159.11 crore. By revenue generated from the tournament, GMR Sports has been the most successful franchisee.
Indiawin Sports — controlled by industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s wife Nita Ambani — the owner of the Mumbai Indians IPL team, has an accumulated loss of Rs 101.05 crore, according to its filings with RoC. In 2013-14, it reported a loss of Rs 5.04 crore, against Rs 4.4 crore the previous year. The company does not disclose its revenue figures in its RoC filings.
K P H Dream Cricket, co-owned by Bollywood actor Preity Zinta and the owner of Kings XI Punjab, reported a loss of Rs 4.35 crore in 2013-14. It had made a profit of Rs 78 lakh in 2012-13 and losses of Rs 1.5 crore and Rs 35 crore in 2011-12 and the previous year, respectively.
Rajasthan Royals owner Jaipur IPL Cricket, and Royal Challengers Sports that owns Royal Challengers Bangalore, did not file financial details for 2013-14 with RoC.
India Cements, which owns Chennai Super Kings, and SUN TV Network, which owns Sunrisers Hyderabad, run other businesses as well.
Rajasthan Royals, the winner of the inaugural edition of IPL and Chennai Super Kings, which won the title twice, are likely to be defranchised for next year’s eighth season of IPL. This could eventually lead to a revenue loss of more than Rs 1,000 crore to the tournament.
More than 50 per cent of an IPL team’s revenue comes from BCCI, primarily through central sponsorship and fees for digital & broadcast rights that the board shares with team owners. Besides, there are other sponsorships that teams get and earnings from ticket sales. On a game day, a team owner gets about 40 per cent of the stadium revenue as well.

Las Vegas and the Global Casino We Call Wall StreetCross-posted with TomDispatch.com
[The following Rebecca Solnit piece is slightly adapted from photographer Michael Light’s new book, Lake Las Vegas/Black Mountain , and appears at TomDispatch.com with special thanks to his publisher, Radius Books.]
“Oh my God, I’m in hell,” I cried out when the car that had rolled  for hours through the luscious darkness of the Mojave night came to a  jolting stop at a traffic light on Las Vegas Boulevard, right by the  giant oscillating fuchsia flowers of the Tropicana. Back then, in the  late 1980s, the Strip was the lasciviously long neon tongue a  modest-sized city unfurled into the desert. Behind the casinos lining  Las Vegas Boulevard was the desert itself -- pale, flat, stony ground  with creosote bushes here and there, a vast expanse of darkness,  silence, and spaciousness pressing in on the riotousness from all  directions.
Las Vegas was so bright you couldn’t see stars anywhere near the city, and you could see the glow on the horizon from dozens of miles away. (They say astronauts could see it from space.) But the old Las Vegas celebrated deserts and the West: Its early casinos were the Apache (1932), the El Cortez (1941), the Pioneer and the Last Frontier (1942), the El Rancho (1947), the Desert Inn (1950), the Sahara (1952), the Stardust and the Dunes (1955). Most of them were technically in Paradise, the unincorporated area outside the Las Vegas city limits.
They were vulgar, they were garish, and they were also a confident new American architecture, something unprecedented, designed to be seen from cars on the Strip, named to celebrate the mythic desert and the romanticized West (and the Arabic east of casbahs and oases), though their architecture and lavish applications of neon were futuristic in a Jetsons kind of way. Maybe that past begat that future; maybe covered wagons led to outer space -- the final frontier, as Star Trek told us, with similar colonial possibilities. The iconography of the casinos was about the here and now, drawing on the past but looking forward to what still felt like the American century with decades to go.

The Europeanate past was used up in that equation, dust to be shaken off en route to an optimistic version of the future.
Sometime in the 1980s that confidence in the country and in the future fell apart and Americans began to genuflect to Europe again -- to a hackneyed, imagined past that conveyed tradition, privilege, and classiness of the kind that has a lot of upper-class aspiration to it. You can see it in the metamorphosis of the casinos. Cowboys and Arabian Nights in the desert were over; the anywhere-but-here era had arrived in a torrent of faux-Provence and pseudo-Tuscany.
In 1989, the Mirage opened, said to be the first casino built by Wall Street -- with junk-bond money -- though its décor was about being in Polynesia, not Manhattan. To draw in onlookers, a volcano erupted in front of the casino at regular intervals with jets of water, red lights, and a roar. Magnate Steve Wynn built Treasure Island next door in 1993, with a small ocean out front in which a nautical brawl took place over and over, a casino inspired by a picaresque novel written by a tubercular Scotsman (as were Disney’s Pirates of the Caribbean ride and blockbuster films). By 1998, the Bellagio -- named after the peninsular resort town on Lake Como, Italy -- had opened. It featured a small gallery of multimillion-dollar art trophies -- a Van Gogh! a Monet! -- and was fronted by an eight-acre lake whose fountains spurted water on the half-hour during afternoons and every quarter hour in the evenings.
The new casinos flaunted water as a luxury good and a display of power here in a desert so hot and dry that nearby Lake Mead loses up to a million acre-feet to evaporation annually, about three times the water that the Sierra Nevada’s considerable Hetch Hetchy reservoir holds. (Think of it as a lake thrown up into the sky to disappear, over and over.) These pedestrian-oriented attractions also may signal the perpetual traffic jam on the Strip, which had developed as a place one sped through in a car but is now a sort of Mojave Champs-Élysées, on whose sidewalks tens of thousands of tourists meander even on the hottest days, while everywhere else in Clark County remains car-dependent.
The new Las Vegas invites you to defy or deny outright the desert that the old Vegas celebrated, and Paris, New York City, and other fantasias have sprung from the ruins of the old attractions. Maybe it was the shift from an earnest modernism, with its faith in the future, to a chameleon postmodernism; certainly, it marks a shift from a rough populist vision to fantasies of aristocracy and elitism.
Wynn blew up the iconic Dunes on October 27, 1993. The futuristic Landmark was imploded in 1995, the Sands and the Hacienda in 1996, the Aladdin in 1998, the former Thunderbird/El Rancho in 2000, and the Desert Inn was demolished in stages, with the major implosion in 2001. The jaunty outer-space-and-neon-themed Stardust was blown up in 2007. As structures, these casinos were in their prime, but as concepts, they were out of fashion, and so they were disposable and then disposed of.
The implosions are popular YouTube videos. You can watch the casinos’ annihilations over and over, their signs wavering as their whole structures appear to become liquid, undulating and flowing for a moment before they collapse into dust. The implosions look like little homages to the nuclear detonations that were visible from Las Vegas before the Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963 sent the radioactive explosions underground (where they still sometimes rocked the city).
The Las Vegas Sands Corporation owns the casinos named the Venetian and the Palazzo. The Venetian stands where the Sands once stood, and the corporation’s principal owner, Sheldon Adelson, the 14th richest man in the world and a huge funder of the Republican Party, tried hard to buy the outcome of the 2012 presidential election -- a $150 million gamble he lost. Maybe what had failed in America was what was failing in Las Vegas: the idea of a democratic, forward-looking society with room for everyone.
At War in Nevada
The sprawl of Clark County contains almost three-quarters of all the people in the state of Nevada, which means statewide elections are swung by a population that mostly just got here and often doesn’t have much idea of where here is. Maybe that’s why water use per capita is so much higher here than in a place like Tucson, Arizona, whose citizens seem to love the desert and plant their front yards with cacti, not grass. About 70% of the water in Clark County goes to lawns, parks, and golf courses, to planting green in a place whose colors are warm and dusty, browns and greys and rusty reds under the burning blue sky.
Nearly 40 million people pass through Las Vegas and its satellites annually, mostly inhabiting the 140,000 hotel rooms in the area, though second homes have increased. Transience defines the place. Imagine the tourists, the traffic, the airplanes, and the semi-trucks all sped up; imagine the place as a pulsating hive of comings and goings; and then imagine the massive engineering that sends power here from the Navajo Generating Station in Arizona, from Hoover Dam’s hydroelectric works, and elsewhere; and finally imagine the water pumped in from the Colorado River. The place is a vortex of material consumption, a mirage of habitability created by massive imports from elsewhere.

Little of substance is produced here. Food, water, building materials, people, and power, all arrive in trucks, trains, planes, pipelines, and over transmission lines. Transience might be the most salient marker of the place, along with evanescence. One notable material item was produced here in the past, however: Ammonium perchlorate -- an oxidizer for rocket boosters and missiles -- was made at the PEPCON factory in Henderson, the cobbled-together town that includes the exclusive Lake Las Vegas and Ascaya gated developments that Michael Light details in the pages of Lake Las Vegas/Black Mountain . After the Challenger explosion in 1986, supplies of the stuff backed up on-site, so that when the factory exploded in 1988 the impact was equal to a one-kiloton nuclear bomb.
Nuclear bombs were still exploded regularly in those days 60 miles north of Las Vegas at the Nevada Test Site, but even the bombs were designed and made elsewhere. The Nevada Test Site was carved out of Nellis Air Force Base, an expanse the size of Connecticut set aside during the Second World War and in use ever since. Nevada is a place in which the only wars fought were skirmishes against its own native people -- the Paiutes, Shoshone, Washoe, and Goshutes. It’s also where wars abroad are rehearsed.
And these days it’s where drones on killing missions in Afghanistan and Pakistan are operated. Pilots sit in rooms and decide whether to kill groups of people based on aerial video footage; the drones are both flying cameras and killing machines. The drone operators are gambling that, based on limited low-grade data, they are killing "militants." Over and over again they kill people who, even under their own dubious guidelines, are often not appropriate targets. But then, for drone operators, the losses are as low as the odds are bad. Maybe death, pleasure, security, and risk are the products of this region. The risk: One day driving down the Strip about a decade ago, I realized that every hotel tower, every fountain, and every chandelier was largely paid for by losing bets.
I understood for the first time what gambling really means.
Parting With Your Money and Your Spouse
Nothing has lasted here. A Mormon outpost had been set up in the oasis that Las Vegas’s name (“the meadows” in Spanish) memorializes, but it failed in the 1850s. There were various mining booms and busts in the vicinity, but the gold deposits all were further north, in Goldfield and Tonopah and some of the little towns whose ghosts now lie within the precincts of the Test Site. Nevada was so depopulated by 1900 -- Las Vegas’s total population was a booming 25 at the time -- that it was faced with losing its statehood.
The Union Pacific railroad turned Vegas into a maintenance depot for its lines, which brought a modest prosperity and some population growth. Then, when the workers tried to unionize in the early 1920s, the railroad “signed the town’s death warrant,” as Las Vegas-based historian Hal Rothman has put it, by moving the maintenance yard and the 300 jobs down the line to Caliente, near Utah. The town withered again.
Boulder Dam (now Hoover Dam) was the next thing to bring people to the region. From 1931 to 1935, hordes of Depression-era workmen lived in inhumane heat and working conditions and sometimes died in them as they built what was then the world’s biggest dam. Though people like to suggest that there’s a correlation between the massive dam -- still one of the world’s 20 largest -- and the neon on the Strip, about half the electricity generated at Hoover goes to southern California and another 18% to Arizona.
Nevada legalized gambling in 1931 and easy divorce around the same time: Money and spouses were easier to part with in the Silver State than elsewhere in the U.S.A. The Las Vegas region began to grow, doubling its population over and over again, going from nearly nothing in 1900 to 273,000 in 1970, 741,459 in 1990, almost 1.4 million by 2000, and two million today. Gambling, more politely called gaming, became its principal economy, broadened into tourism, and growth itself produced jobs in construction. The region grew so fast a local mapmaker issued a new map monthly for delivery people seeking addresses that had just come into being.
I watched the Strip go, in little more than a decade, from that neon line in the desert to the center of a metropolis that spread for perhaps 10 miles on either side. The various development projects, from humble apartments to gated communities, each made to enclose a cluster of lives and to feed profit to someone somewhere else, seemed like a quilt of randomly developed patches: here a shopping center, there some light industry, here a fortified condominium multiplex, there some luxury homes on what would cease to be an urban edge as development moved outward again.
Casino-era Las Vegas had always had two faces. Visitors came to take a chance at getting rich or going broke at the slot machines and gaming tables and betting sites. Locals eventually made Las Vegas the last great unionized city in the country, a place where, people liked to say, a hotel maid could own a home and send her kids to college. It might have been hot and sprawling and a place where addiction (to gambling, as well as substances) was rife, but it was a place where the modest dream of getting by and maybe even getting ahead on honest work throve for a while, a place of security as well as risk.

Toward the millennium, that changed. Rothman wrote not long afterward, “While only a very few can afford to live in places like Lake Las Vegas, such construction altered the housing market. High-end construction pulled the housing market upward. In 2000 the median housing price climbed by a remarkable 10.9%.” Housing prices climbed far more after 2003. Within a few years, what constituted “affordable” mutated, as people took on interest-only mortgages, subprime loans, and bought houses they could only keep if the market continued to skyrocket. They were gambling, though the one thing you should learn in Las Vegas is that the house always wins.
After the crash in 2008, southern Nevada became the foreclosure and unemployment capital of the nation. Lined up like cherries on depression’s slot machine, all three of Las Vegas’s industries -- tourism, gaming, and construction -- collapsed. Clark County itself imploded for a while. It has faltered toward recovery, but it still has the least stable housing market in America as of March 2014, and 37% of Las Vegas properties are, in that ironic word, underwater. Maybe the region was the last frontier of getting by. And then it wasn’t.
Europe in the Desert
The historian Frederick Jackson Turner announced the closing of the American frontier in 1893. He both praised and excoriated the characteristics of frontier-dwellers, in terms that still sound like Nevada:
"As has been indicated, the frontier is productive of individualism... But the democracy born of free land, strong in selfishness and individualism, intolerant of administrative experience and education, and pressing individual liberty beyond its proper bounds, has its dangers as well as its benefits. Individualism in America has allowed a laxity in regard to governmental affairs, which has rendered possible the spoils system and all the manifest evils that follow from the lack of a highly developed civic spirit. In this connection may be noted also the influence of frontier conditions in permitting lax business honor, inflated paper currency, and wild-cat banking."
The Frontier casino and hotel, opened in 1942, was blown up in 2007 (after surviving a seven-year strike in the 1990s by union workers who picketed out front continuously during that time). Something was supposed to be built in its place, but pale, dusty ground now interrupts the series of fantasies that constitute the casinos of the Strip. Imagine dressing up a weather-beaten old monk in various costumes: magician, archduke, pharaoh, contessa, gangster, and you’ve imagined the endless architectural guises in which the desert has been draped. It’s treated as a blank slate, but in the long run it’s neither neutral nor malleable; rather it’s a force whose identity inexorably reasserts itself, whether as windstorms that blow down the signs, flash floods that fill the underpasses, or dry heat so withering that moisture is drawn out of your body with every breath, your sweat evaporating so efficiently you don’t realize you are losing water.
There was a long period when Las Vegas was a discordant place in the United States, one where the rules elsewhere about propriety and prudence were broken. Las Vegas was not like the United States, but then the United States became like Las Vegas. Wall Street morphed into a great deregulated casino, buying and selling, among other things, bundled mortgages whose solidity was unclear to anyone. And then it all turned out to be a house of cards and the global economy collapsed, devastating countless lives. The house always wins; Wall Street rose from the ruins, but many of the ordinary people of Las Vegas, among other places, did not.
Their losses are not the only reason the place has no easy future. Someday the arid West will have to come to terms with its limits, as dissidents have been saying since the nineteenth century. Some places already have to a degree, or will not have to be reined in as hard, but Las Vegas will come crashing -- is coming crashing -- to its withered, desiccated knees. The heat is already brutal, with summer days of 110- to 115-degree Fahrenheit weather, and it will get hotter. Water is nearly always the limiting factor of growth in the arid West, and Vegas drained its own local supply long ago, then put a straw in the Colorado River and sucked hard, getting 90% of its water from the river, or rather from Lake Mead, the reservoir penned in behind Hoover Dam -- which is running dry. The reservoir is at its lowest level “in generations,” the Los Angeles Times reported in the spring of 2014.
Lake Mead’s water is dropping so dramatically that the city is drilling a billion-dollar intake tunnel through bedrock, well below the current intake pipelines, a new straw with which to drink from the reservoir. That, too, may before long be above waterline if drought, evaporation, and over-allocation of the river’s water continue. In the foreseeable future, the reservoir will likely reach “dead pool,” the point at which water no longer turns the turbines of the dam generators (though one desperate measure now being aired proposes abandoning Lake Powell and Glen Canyon Dam upstream on the Colorado River to salvage this complex). Clark County recently spent $200 million getting residents to remove their lawns, and at some point in the near future water rationing will begin.
Las Vegas has also been on a hunt for new water sources for the past 20 years. The preferred scheme is to drain the beautiful rural and wild lands of eastern Nevada into a 300-mile pipeline so that the golf courses stay green and the showers keep running. Eastern Nevadans regard this as a death warrant for their region’s ranches, small towns, and wildlife and have been fighting back, rural Davids against an urban Goliath. They won the most recent round in court, though Goliath is not giving up. Even so, someday Las Vegas will have to face, again, the fact that it is in the deep desert. In the meantime, the place is currently building monuments to the fantasy of being anywhere and everywhere else.
Lake Las Vegas, the subject of Michael Light’s aerial photographs in Lake Las Vegas/Black Mountain , is such an explicitly European fantasy that a replica of Florence’s famous Ponte Vecchio bridge crosses a stretch of its artificial lake, and the houses are mostly in the stucco-and-tile-roof mode called “Mediterranean.” From near the earth you see into yards and houses, terra cotta roofs, pieces fitting together like a puzzle, tight to each other, despite the expanse all around, or you see the texture of the earth that has been groomed and scraped and graded into something you can drop a mansion onto. From a little ways higher, you see the layout of the streets, like a fingerprint pressed into the landscape, the whorls and cul-de-sacs of the curvilinear layouts beloved of developers.
If Light’s airplane went higher still, the fingerprint would disappear into the sprawl and from high enough you’d see the vast built-up region of Clark County, that compound of urban entities usually referred to collectively as Las Vegas. Lake Las Vegas is technically in Henderson, a hamlet that obligingly adjusted its city limits to incorporate the new developments. Lake Las Vegas is all the things that are contemporary Las Vegas: a gated community, a place of second homes, a lot of architectural and verbal references to anyplace but this one (that Florentine bridge, those subdivisions named Marseilles and Barcelona), water under an evaporative sky, golf courses, some still startlingly green in that dry landscape, some abandoned in bankruptcy to turn a more harmonious gold.
It is a place in which time lurches and stalls. Ground was broken to create this planned development in 1987, and its dam was begun in 1990. Water coming down the Las Vegas Wash was sent through two underground conduits, each eight feet in diameter, beneath the reservoir. The reservoir -- the “lake” of Lake Las Vegas -- that arose behind the dam is an artificial and unmoving body of water perched atop real water flow that has been hidden and buried. The official timeline provided for the place is a history of luxury hotels and golf tournaments and subdivisions. That casinos and hotels have gone broke, closed, been renamed and reopened, born again and again and again, but dying repeatedly too, amid lawsuits, is not so evident, and the timeline stops in 2007.
“Lake at Las Vegas Joint Venture Limited Liability Corporation” filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on July 17, 2008, early in the crash, reemerging two years later with half a billion to a billion dollars of debt swept away and new development plans and financing. And also with a lawsuit by creditors against developers, and resort property owners against lenders, because the whole thing was a gamble, a hustle, the use of some arid land in Nevada by men far away to juggle money among various parties and into their own pockets. You look at these pictures and see the reality of real estate, the solidity of place, something as concrete as, well, concrete, but it was all numbers in accounts moved around by distant men, all just another wager, as though these houses were just poker chips on the great gaming table of the desert.
The Wall Street Journal reports that homeowners at Lake Las Vegas and three other resorts
"are suing Credit Suisse Group AG for $24 billion, accusing the Swiss bank of running a ‘loan-to-own’ program that loaded the resorts up with debt so it could foreclose on their assets when the debt couldn’t be repaid. They allege that Credit Suisse knew the resorts wouldn’t be able to perform under the loans, which would allow the bank to take the reins to the debt-saddled resorts cheaply."
So when you look at this place from Michael Light’s aerial perspective you see a vertiginous compression of place: the austere beauty of Nevada itself, the mountains being carved away into terraces on which homes will be built to resemble parts of Europe, the Mediterranean mashed up with Scottish golf, built mostly by Latino labor with materials from China and other parts of the world, with financing and profits that have become part of the global casino we call Wall Street.
Looking from above, you see the aggressiveness of these developments: the forcing of green, of trees and bushes and vines in a dry place, the forcing of the iconography of distant places on one so different, one whose essential characteristics -- other than sunshine -- are irrelevant to builders and buyers. Every planted bush is a little soldier marching on the desert, but the desert pushes back with power far grander than anything landscaping can muster, with heat, with scalding sun, with time itself.
Because what you also see in Light’s aerial pictures is that all this is transient, fleeting, precarious: It will go dry, crumble into ruin; the restless, rootless populations will move on. Though all this fleeting hubris and bustle has reshaped and scarred the land, what will be here when they are gone are geology and the primordial forces of weather, water, and wind. The earth endures.

17-day boys private part chopped off due to  family rivalry  in RajasthanComments
The private part of a 17-day-old boy was chopped off out of an alleged family rivalry in Rajasthan , which the doctors say can’t be reconstructed till the boy attains the age of 5 years.
The incident took place in Jaipur where the boy’s father alleged that the suspected family member had earlier  threatened to bring ruin upon his married life. He demanded immediate arrest of the culprit.
However, DCP Jaipur (East) Kunwar Rashtradeep said the police could not take any action before probing it cautiously as it was a sensitive issue.
The boy’s father, Akhil Jain, told HT that he came to know about the incident from his wife Parul when he was away on an official visit to Banswara on November 27. 
He said his wife was taking bath at around 7am that day when his father heard the baby cry. Both rushed to the baby’s room and found his sexual organ cut off.
They rushed the bleeding boy to a nearby hospital and later to SMS Hospital, where he was kept in the surgical ICU for two days. Later, the doctors told the family that the reconstructive surgery was not possible until the boy attained 5 years of age.
The family lodged the FIR against an unnamed family member with the police on November 28.
Dr GS Kalra, head of Plastic Surgery department of SMS Hospital, said, "The reconstructive surgery is likely to take close to five hours.  We cannot put such a small child under general anaesthesia for so long."
Sources claimed that the police too were suspecting the role of a family member, but they weren’t committing it before establishing the motive of the heinous act.

Thanksgiving Is Over But "Shopmas" Has Just Begun"Anyone who lives within their means suffers from a lack of imagination." -- Oscar Wilde
If Oscar Wilde was correct, Americans have no limit to their imagination during the holiday season.
The National Retail Federation estimates that over 55 percent of all holiday shoppers intended to shop for Christmas gifts during the four day Thanksgiving weekend. With almost 75 million young people under the age of 18, the pressure is really on the oldsters to deliver the "goods." See table ...
In too many households, gifts are charged to credit cards which can add double digit interest rates to the cost of purchases. This creates downward pressures on credit scores if cards get loaded up. According to AOL's DailyFinance , a pocket full of maxed out credit cards will  devastate your credit score and the best credit score can only be maintained by limiting card usage to 30 percent of your available credit. This requires a tremendous amount of self discipline when faced with children from toddlers to teens who want the latest and greatest gizmo.
To burden the obvious, the holiday season has devolved into a manipulative profit driven machine that's designed to shame us into buying things for others that we can't afford and they don't need.
The herd syndrome associated with shopping on Black Friday adds an undeniable layer of stress and stupidity to our lives because we are surrounded by ads that tell us to buy, buy, buy at the same time other ads tell us to celebrate and relax.
The mixed message of Thanksgiving is so absurd that to many, Black Friday has become the annual practical joke that we play on ourselves.  Each year, the pressure to buy earlier and buy more increases as big retailers choose to stay open on Thanksgiving Day.
Bloomberg View's  columnist Barry Ritholtz called Black Friday a hoax and dubbed the time between Thanksgiving and Christmas as "Shopmas" in this article .
It's time to say "enough already." Enough of the manipulation. Instead of shortening Thanksgiving to a single rushed meal between the pressures of work and shopping, let's extend Thanksgiving to include two official national holidays.
Thursday will continue to be a day celebration and Friday will become the National Day of rest and relaxation. Then, start the crazed shopping on Saturday morning. NO, that doesn't translate to opening at midnight. Don't even think about it. Open the stores at 10 a.m. on Saturday MORNING. A full eight or nine hours of sleep will help everyone, thank you.
Obviously, law enforcement, fire fighters, essential medical professionals and other first responders have unique responsibilities that limit Thanksgiving celebrations, but by extending the "official" holiday to 48 hours, everyone will have a better opportunity to spend a full day with family and friends while being paid for both days which is an important adjunct of the plan. Most assuredly, waiting until Saturday to shop won't destroy the business model of any retailer, all their protestations notwithstanding.
If Saturday ever replaces Black Friday as the holiest of shopping days, some special name or acronym must be chosen that's befitting of it's status. Several names come to mind. Names like "Bargain Saturday," or "Bountiful Saturday" or, for the more jaded, SH*#%Y Saturday.
We could throw creativity to the wind and coin the day "Black Saturday" or just shorten it to "BS Day" because BS is the acronym most deserving of the activity.
Better yet, we could ignore the madness and sit on the couch with someone we love and watch It's A Wonderful Life and The Wizard of Oz

US  Iraqis helping to train Sunni fighters ...Haider al-Abadi
(US forces and their Iraqi…)
BRUSSELS: US forces and their Iraqi counterparts have trained about 2,000 Sunni fighters in Iraq as part of efforts to defeat the Islamic State extremist group, a senior US official said Tuesday.
Iraq's Shiite-led government, trying to reverse the marginalisation of Sunnis, is seeking to form a "bridging entity" where Sunnis tribesmen defend their provinces before they are brought into an Iraqi national force, the State Department official told reporters on condition of anonymity.
The official disclosed the information as US Secretary of State John Kerry prepared Wednesday to host talks in Brussels with foreign ministers from scores of countries which are trying to help defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
The official said the training was occurring at Al-Asad air base in Anbar province and elsewhere.
Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi , a Shiite whose more inclusive government was formed in September, "is committed ultimately to bringing the Sunnis into the mainstream," the official said.
IS proclaimed a caliphate in Syria and Iraq in June after making dramatic advances across a swathe of Iraq, partly as a result of appealing to a marginalised Sunni population.
The members of Iraq's government "are working to empower Sunni fighters. They are already graduating Sunni fighters out in Al Asad in the Anbar province," the official said.
Citing figures from Abadi, he said some 2,000 fighters had graduated from Al-Asad and elsewhere and they will eventually form a national guard.
He confirmed the US forces, along with their Iraqi counterparts, were training the Sunnis from tribes in Anbar province, while the Iraqi troops were providing them with equipment.
The government is also aiming to form Shiite national guards in Shiite areas as well as mixed forces in areas where both sects live, he added. Ahead of building up a national force that defends Iraq's territory, "it recognises there needs to be a middle tier that can respond to terrorism and criminality at the provincial level," he said.
"That is the concept behind the national guard," he said. The official said foreign ministers from European, Arab and other states that are part of the 60-member coalition against IS will discuss strategy Wednesday at their first ministerial meeting.
Besides discussing the military aspect, they will discuss how to stem the flow of thousands of foreign fighters, delegitimise the IS "brand," disrupt IS finances, and provide humanitarian aid to people affected by the violence, the official said.

Ashton Carter likely next US Defence Secret...Ashton Carter
(Former US Deputy Secretary…)
WASHINGTON: Former US Deputy Secretary of Defence, Ashton Carter is President Barack Obama's pick to be the next Defence Secretary, multiple media reports said today.
Obama has not made an announcement in this regard yet. Carter served in multiple positions in the Obama administration at the Pentagon; the last one being that of the Deputy Secretary of Defence. In that capacity, he was instrumental in launching the path breaking Defence Trade and Technology Initiative (DTTI) with India.
The former number-two ranking official at the Pentagon, Carter, likely will be named as the next US defence secretary, CNN reported today.
Obama was set to name Carter to replace outgoing Pentagon chief Chuck Hagel, "barring any last minute complications," CNN said, citing several unnamed administration officials.
Outgoing Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel resigned last week, with officials privately saying he was forced out after losing the confidence of the White House.
Carter, 60, has acquired a reputation as an expert on hi-tech weapons and military spending, conveying himself as a reformer aiming to make the vast Pentagon bureaucracy more efficient.
While Carter is well-versed with weapons programmes and technological issues, he has less experience overseeing war strategy and has never served in the military - unlike Hagel, who saw action in the Vietnam War.
An academic with a doctorate in theoretical physics from the University of Oxford, Carter worked in the Pentagon during Bill Clinton's presidency overseeing nuclear weapons policies and aided efforts to remove nuclear weapons from Ukraine and other former Soviet republics.
A former professor at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, Carter served as the Pentagon's top weapons buyer from 2009 to 2011 and then as deputy defence secretary until 2013.

EU may lift ban onIndian mango  veggiesEU may lift ban on Indian mango, veggies
Prasun Sonwalkar , Hindustan Times  London, December 02, 2014
First Published: 22:42 IST(2/12/2014) | Last Updated: 02:17 IST(3/12/2014)
Comments
The European Union (EU) is likely to announce the lifting of a ban on the import of mangoes and some vegetables from India following an audit of packaging systems in India by a team from Brussels in September.
A report following the EU’s Food and Veterinary Office visit to India to evaluate the system of official controls for the export of plants and plant products from India to the EU was presented and discussed during the committee’s meeting on November 25 and 26, official sources said on Tuesday.
The ban, imposed due to concerns over pests and insects in consignments from India, was announced by the European Union’s Standing Committee on Plant Health on March 26, 2014.
Businessmen from London and elsewhere who cater to the Asian clientele said that the ban had a “devastating” impact on them, and also on growers and importers based in India. Losses due to the ban have been mentioned as running into “hundreds of thousands of pounds”.
Besides protesting against the ban, India has conveyed to EU, details about its upgraded packaging facilities. Officials said that pests and insects were found in 207 consignments of fruits and vegetables imported into the EU from India in 2013. The prohibited items represent less than 5% of the total fruits and vegetables imported into EU from India.
A revision of the ban was originally scheduled to take place before December 31, 2015, but following the team’s visit to India, it is expected to be lifted shortly.

Shahim Tanki wants to return to India too: AreebComments
Areeb Majeed, the 22-year-old college student who is in the custody of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) after his return from the Islamic State of Syria and the Levant (ISIS), has told investigators that his 25-year-old friend Shahim Farooque Tanki also wants to head back to India.
Shahim, who used to work at a call centre, was among the four young men from Kalyan who joined the ISIS’ campaign to create a Caliphate in Iraq and Syria.
Areeb has told investigators that he was in touch with the three other youngsters who went with him to work for the ISIS, and that they were his friends. Areeb said he kept in touch with Shahim, Aman Tandel and Fahad Shaikh through the messenger of a social networking site, while all four were in Iraq.
It was during one of these chat sessions that Shahim expressed his desire to return home, said police sources.
The national anti-terrorism agency, which has been closely monitoring the status of the youngsters, is expected to draw up plans if Shahim or any of the other young men contact their family members and say they want to return, said police sources.
NIA, which is investigating the way in which the four young men were radicalised, has learnt from Areeb that apart from online chat forums where his handler would talk to him about the need for ‘jihad’ to establish a ‘Caliphate’, he was also asked to go through videos containing first person accounts of foreign nationals who had joined ISIS.
ISIS has been making pervasive use of social media platforms in order to publicise its recruitment videos. “These videos portray how young people from countries such as Canada, France, Britain and the United States have let go of their good lives to join ISIS. Laced with slogans, such videos are persuasive enough to attract certain young people,” said a senior police officer, requesting anonymity.
Areeb’s initial radicalisation took place through local contacts, who later introduced him to closed internet groups that indoctrinated him further. NIA will also be questioning men who are under the scanner for having allegedly indoctrinated the four young men.

Pols arent helping heal racial divideBy Jennifer Rubin December 2 Follow @JRubinBlogger
The latest Post-ABC poll confirms that in the Obama era we are very divided on racial and political lines. Forty-eight percent of all adults surveyed approve of the St. Louis grand jury’s decision not to indict police officer Darren Wilson while 45 percent do not; among registered voters 52 percent approve, and 40 percent do not — a far cry from the portrayal one sees in the mainstream media, which almost uniformly view the grand jury decision as appalling. Meanwhile, 58 percent of whites and only 9 percent of African Americans approve of the decision, while 35 percent of whites and 85 percent of African Americans disapprove. The party divide is nearly as great: Republicans approve of the grand jury’s decision by a 76 to 18 percent margin, while Democrats disapprove by a 68 to 27 percent margin.
Student activists stage a “die-in” at Washington University in St. Louis on Monday as part of a protest demanding justice for the shooting of Michael Brown. (Adrees Latif/Reuters)
Put differently, half of the country thinks the other half is in another universe, and in a sense they are. If you are white or a Republican, you more likely than not view the riots and the feds as the problem, exacerbating racial tension and promoting mob justice. If you are black or Democrat, you more likely than not think the jury and/or prosecutor were out to lunch and the judicial system is rigged along racial lines.
We can argue about whether both the media and the political opportunists (on both sides) have made things worse, but certainly we have seen in a series of recent incidents (Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., Trayvon Martin and now Ferguson, Mo.) that we are far from the promise of a post-racial country. That does not mean that we are back to the days of Jim Crow or that we have not made huge strides in the past 5o years. But there is a certain incomprehension across racial lines. How can they think that way? Don’t they get it?
We cannot expect restraint from the cable TV shows, which delight in round-the-clock airtime to inflame (they would say “engage”) their audiences. But what of the political class?
For Republicans, the danger goes both ways. If you clamber on board the “police are racists/the system is rigged” bandwagon before even the basic facts are known, as Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) did , you risk infuriating the large majority of the party, which will see this as grandstanding and out of touch. For better or worse, the GOP remains the party of law and order and generally will afford law enforcement the benefit of the doubt. However, if a politician engages in histrionics about the protesters and denies the necessity of reforms in policing, he or she risks alienating those outside the GOP (although independents do view the grand jury decision positively by a 50 to 41 margin).
Democrats are on rocky terrain as well. The president gets rotten marks for his handling of the situation. Registered voters disapprove of his handling of the matter by a 52 to 40 percent margin; Republicans disapprove (72 to 21 percent) and independents by a margin of 53 to 37 percent. His tepid support from Democrats (58 to 35 percent) hardly makes up for the overwhelming criticism from non-Democrats. Had he been more critical of the grand jury and of the police, he might have improved his numbers within the Democratic Party, but lost others by an even bigger margin. In some respects, it is disappointing that his rather balanced approach seemed to disappoint most everyone, rather than garner grudging appreciation. That said, the president and his attorney general have become such divisive figures that at this point Obama and his advisers have ironically become among the least effective figures in such situations.
Can any politician get this “right”? It helps not to pontificate in a vacuum; these are events in a context of specific facts. It helps to call for people to respect the rule of law; we cannot convert criminal proceedings with the presumption of innocence into show trials or venues for much larger social issues. But no matter how precise one can be (e.g. distinguishing between the grand jury, the peaceful protesters, the violent protesters) or how much you talk about it (any discussion is too much for some, no amount is sufficient for others), there is no magic formula. Perhaps pols should focus first on not making things worse — which sometimes means waiting for actual facts and imploring others to do the same. Modesty and empathy — the recognition that people see the same event very differently — are a starting point.
Ultimately, the “solution” in these cases is to break down the them-vs.-us standoff between police and minority communities and to have those on the scene be responsive and accessible. If police and political leaders are estranged from segments of society, they cannot heal that breach in moments of high crisis.
And while there is no shortage of “discussions about race,” there is a shortage of good-faith discussions about upward mobility, anti-poverty measures and efforts to build more inclusive communities. It is among the great disappointments with this president that so little has been done in this regard and that we have, sadly, hopped from one crisis to another. His penchant for sticking it to Republicans is not matched by his ardor in seeking common ground.
We could use a less divisive president with a better sense of connection to all Americans.

Hawking s software goes open source for disa...Stephen Hawking's speech software goes open source for disabled
By AFP | 3 Dec, 2014, 12.07AM IST
The communications system will be made available to researchers on the Internet as "open source", although it would still have to be adapted for individual users.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
LONDON: The system that helps Stephen Hawking communicate with the outside world will be made available online from January in a move that could help millions of motor neurone disease sufferers , scientists said Tuesday.
The wheelchair-bound theoretical physicist, who shot to international fame in the 1980s with his book "A Brief History of Time", hailed the decision by US tech giant Intel at a press conference in London.
"By making this technology freely available, it has the potential to greatly improve the life of disabled people all over the world," said Hawking, his words relayed by the robotic voice of his computer.
"Without this, I would not be able to speak to you today," said the 72-year-old, who was diagnosed at the age of 21 with a motor neurone disease related to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
The communications system will be made available to researchers on the Internet as " open source ", although it would still have to be adapted for individual users.
Hawking, who teaches at Cambridge University, can write on his computer using a cheek sensor which is detected by an infrared switch mounted to his glasses and helps him select characters.
His current system, developed by Intel over the past three years, reduces the number of moves needed to spell out words, as well as giving him new functions for the first time such as sending email attachments.
"Hawking's typing speed is twice as fast and there is a tenfold improvement in common tasks," Intel said in a statement.
The British company SwiftKey has also digitized all his works to help the computer guess more quickly what he is trying to say.
Hawking, who is almost entirely paralysed, demonstrated the new system in public for the first time on Tuesday.
In a press release, he said: "Medicine has not been able to cure me, so I rely on technology to help me communicate and live."
Quadriplegia and motor neurone disease affect over three million people worldwide.
Lama Nachman of Intel Labs said: "Technology for the disabled is often a proving ground for the technology of the future."

Sources said the Prime Minister, while addressing the BJP Parliamentary Party, told the MPs to be cautious while making public comments and asked them not to give any "address to the nation."
Sources said the Prime Minister did not name anyone but later conveyed to minister concerned to regret the remarks made by her at a public rally in the national capital.
The remarks triggered a major controversy with the opposition forcing her to apologize. The issue also rocked Parliament, paralysing the functioning of the Rajya Sabha.
BJP has asked all party MPs to address public meetings in Delhi during the current winter session ahead of assembly elections slated early next year. Of them, 225 have given their approval and their programmes are being fixed, minister of state for parliamentary affairs Rajiv Pratap Rudy said.
Rudy later said the meetings will be held every evening from 6pm to 10pm in every area of Delhi. The party MPs will be briefed accordingly in the next three days at separate meetings for first-timers, second-time MPs and senior party parliamentarians.
During such meetings, party MPs will be asked to make their strategy and chalk out programmes for campaigning in Delhi.

Fairfax officials agree on terms for Silver Line financingBy Lori Aratani December 2 Follow @loriara
Commuters wait for the silver line to depart during the first day of operation at the Wiehle-Reston East station on July 28  in Reston, Va. (Amanda Voisard for the Washington Post)
Fairfax County officials formally agreed Tuesday to the terms for a $403 million, low-interest federal loan they will use to help pay their share of construction costs for the second phase of the Silver Line.
The loan,  which comes from the U.S. Department of Transportation as part of the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA), will cover roughly 45 percent of the county’s estimated share of $915 million. Under the terms of the loan, they money does not have to be paid back until five years after the completion of the $5.6 billion project. Phase 2 of the Silver Line will extend service to Dulles Airport and into Loudoun County, is expected to cost $2.7 billion and be completed in 2018.
The first phase of the rail line opened in July . The rail line was six months late and, with bills still being totaled, could very likely exceed its $2.9 billion price tag.  Still, the rail line has proved popular with the public. Metro officials said ridership is strong , even though Metro ridership overall is down to 2005 levels. The first phase of the rail line includes four stops in Tysons Corner and one in Reston at Wiehle Avenue.
“With Phase 1 on track to meet or even exceed ridership projections, I am very pleased to have approved low-interest federal financing for Phase 2,” said Sharon Bulova, chairwoman of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, in a news release announcing the board’s action.  “The funds made available through the TIFIA loan keep the project on target for completion in 2018 and reduce costs for toll road users and taxpayers. The Silver Line is vital to the economic growth of Fairfax County, the region and the Commonwealth, and I am proud of the work we’ve done to make it a reality.”
Fairfax officials will use money from the Dulles Rail Phase 2 Transportation Improvement District and Commercial and Industrial Tax Fund to repay the loan. The county use $218.2 million from this voluntary tax district and $185.1 million in commercial and industrial taxes.
The federal money was key to a 2011 financing deal to build the rail line’s second phase. In total, Fairfax County, Loudoun County and the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority received nearly  $1.9 billion in TIFIA loan money. It was the largest loan in the history of the TIFIA program. The money also helped stave off further increases for users of the Dulles Toll Road, who are financing the bulk of the Silver Line’s costs. The federal dollars, combined with $300 million from the state of Virginia, likely mean that there will be no more toll increases until 2018, MWAA officials said. Tolls on the 13.4-mile road have increased for five straight years.
As part of the Silver Line funding agreement,  Fairfax County will pay 16.1 percent by Fairfax County, Loudoun County will pay 4.8 percent and MWAA will pay 4.1 percent. The remaining 75 percent comes from Dulles Toll Road users.
The line’s second phase will extend from Wiehle Avenue in Fairfax County to Route 772 in Loudoun County.

FinMin looks forward to RBI plans to support growthFinMin looks forward to RBI plans to support growth
BS Reporter | New Delhi Dec 03, 2014 12:42 AM IST
The finance ministry on Tuesday pinned hopes on the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)'s plans to adopt a dovish approach on interest rates in the coming months, even as the central bank refrained from cutting the policy rate in its bi-monthly monetary policy review. The ministry also exuded hope the proposed monetary policy framework would help its plans to support investment and growth.
"The government looks forward to RBI supporting the revival of growth and employment," the finance ministry said in a statement here.
Though RBI pointed out headline inflation had been receding steadily and current readings were below the January 2015 target of eight per cent, as well as the January 2016 target of six per cent, the central bank, listed out a slew of upside risks going forward.
The statement said the government and RBI would work in the weeks ahead towards a monetary policy framework that would help institutionalise the gains achieved on the inflation front, to reduce inflationary expectations and further support the revival of investment and growth.
The finance ministry and RBI are currently in talks to set up the framework by this month-end or next month. In the new mechanism, the target for inflation is likely to be set by the government, though it is likely to consult RBI and Parliament in this regard.
However, RBI is likely to retain autonomy over monetary tools it would like to adopt to achieve those targets.
The central bank pointed out the investment cycle was still weak in the economy but maintained the status quo on the policy rate.

Falling oil prices this year have sent investors running out of energy stocks. But Tuesday, energy stocks were a gusher of gains for speculators.
The average energy stock in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index is up 1.2%, a pleasant reversal of fortunes for energy investors pummeled all year. The average S&P 500 energy stock is down 12% this year, while the S&P 500 itself is up 11%.
Some of the energy stock gains are impressive. Among the energy stocks posting the largest gains include:
BIGGEST GAINS BY S&P 500 ENERGY STOCKS
Company
3.1%
Sources: S&P Capital IQ, USA TODAY research
Even some of the majors are having a good day. Shares of Chevron (CVX) are up 2.4% and Exxon Mobil (XOM) is up 2.2%.
Why are energy stocks bouncing? It’s not oil prices. The price of West Texas Intermediate fell another 1.5% today. The iPath S&P GSCI Crude Oil exchange-trade note, which trades the prices of oil, is down a crushing 30% this year, punishing oil investors.
But what’s working in energy stocks’ favor? Lower prices, says Sam Stovall, strategist at S&P Capital IQ in a note to clients. Over the past 12 months, the S&P Energy Index is 20% below the S&P 500, he says. Energy stocks have traded this poorly just six times since 1990, and in all six times the index posted positive gains in the following 24 months and beat the S&P 500 five of those six instances, Stovall says.
Speculators are betting the pain will soon be their gain. “Domestic and global energy stocks and sectors have taken it on the chin in the past year on worries surrounding global economic growth and oil supply. And while it’s too soon to say that the end of the concern is behind us, (as well as the resulting pressure on oil prices), it may be time to begin thinking about increasing exposure to domestic and global energy sector ETFs, provided you have the patience to wait anywhere from 12 to 24 months,” Stovall says.

Cabinet clears 14 changes to Companies ActCabinet clears 14 changes to Companies Act
Deepak Patel |  Dec 03, 2014 12:38 AM IST
The Cabinet on Tuesday cleared 14 changes in the Companies Act, 2013, paving the way for tabling the amendments in the ongoing session of Parliament.
The move is aimed at making it easier to do business in India, which is placed at 142 among 189 countries in the recent World Bank report, and addressing concerns raised by India Inc regarding the Act, which was enforced just this financial year.
The amendments include replacing ‘special resolution’ with ‘ordinary resolution’ for approval of related-party transactions by minority shareholders.
This means that the companies only need to have the consent of 50 per cent of the minority shareholders present instead of the 75 per cent, which is prescribed in the current law.

Recently, a special resolution moved by liquor maker United Spirits through postal ballot to approve four related party transactions was defeated by minority shareholders, as per the provisions of the existing Act. Against the 75 per cent favourable votes required, the resolution garnered only 70.2 per cent votes. The proposed amendments, if enforced by now, would have helped the resolution sail through. The new amendment also empowers the Audit Committee to give omnibus approvals for related party transactions on annual basis. The statement said that this is in line with the Sebi policy and to increase the ease of doing business.
Heeding to the corporate demand, the new amendment also proposes to exempt related party transactions between holding companies and wholly owned subsidiaries from the requirement of minority shareholders’ approval.
The amendments also include a new provision which prohibits the public inspection of the board resolutions filed with the Registrar of Companies, according to an official statement issued here.
Company professionals have been complaining to the ministry of corporate affairs that board resolutions, if made public, would reveal the company strategy, helping the competitor inadvertently.
The Cabinet also approved an amendment to ensure that frauds, which are only beyond a certain threshold, would need to be mandatorily reported by the auditors to the government. Any such fraud, which is above the threshold, will also need to be disclosed in the board report.
In the current Act, there is no such threshold, which means that auditor has to report even a small fraud of a thousand rupees to the ministry.
In order to restrain companies from raising illegal deposits, the Cabinet has also okayed provisions prescribing specific punishment for deposits accepted under the new Act. “This was left out in the Act inadvertently,” said the government in the statement.
The new Companies Act, which came into force with effect from April 1 with some provisions yet to become operational, has faced stiff criticism from various quarters for many provisions.
The Companies Act, 2013, was notified in August last year by the previous United Progressive Alliance government. Out of 470 sections in the Act, 283 sections and 22 sets of rules corresponding to such sections have so far been brought into force. This means that around 40 per cent of the Act is yet to be enforced.
The new government has been indicating for quite some time that it would bring in necessary changes to address concerns raised by various stakeholders including corporates.
The Companies (Amendment) Bill, 2014 would now go to the Parliament to bring into effect necessary amendments to the existing Act. Sources said it is likely to be tabled in the current session.

TARC seeks separate cell for the rich  tax on largefarmersBy: ENS Economic Bureau | New Delhi |
Posted: December 3, 2014 2:17 am
A high-level panel set up to review tax laws has suggested a slew of significant changes including bringing large farmers in the tax net, re-introduction of fringe benefit and banking cash transaction taxes, separate cell for high-networth individuals (HNIs) and discouraging cash transaction among other things.
The tax administrative reforms commission (TARC), headed by Parthasarathi Shome, in its third report released on Tuesday, suggested that in order to widen the tax base that has remained largely static, “large farmers should be brought into the tax net. Against a tax free limit of Rs 5 lakh on agricultural income, farmers having income above much higher threshold income, such as Rs 50 lakh, could be taxed.”
The commission said that while small traders should be encouraged to use debit cards extensively, measures should be put in place to discourage cash transactions. The TARC also made a case for increasing the wealth tax base by including intangible financial assets while raising the threshold and decreasing the wealth tax rate.

First time  PM calls all CMs formeetingBy: Express News Service | New Delhi |
Posted: December 3, 2014 2:17 am
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called all chief ministers on December 7 to discuss the future of the Planning Commission, an institution which he publicly said had outlived its utility and needed to be replaced with a new one. This will also be Modi’s first meeting with the chief ministers since taking charge as the Prime Minister.
A senior government official told The Indian Express there was a sense of urgency in the Prime Minister’s Office to finalise the new institution’s design and structure because it has been more than 100 days since the Prime Minister himself made this announcement on August 15. In his Independence Day address, Modi had said the government will “very shortly” move in a direction to make the new institution functional.
“After his return from the G20 Leaders’ Summit and bilateral meetings in Australia, the Prime Minister met senior Cabinet ministers and secretary-level officers to take stock of the action taken by their respective departments over announcements made by the government and by him.
Several were pulled up for poor follow up,” another official said.
Officials said the Planning Commission was set up following a March 15, 1950 Cabinet resolution. Any proposal to replace the Planning Commission with a new institution has to be therefore placed before and approved by the Cabinet.
In fact, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, had in mid-2010 said the Commission must be an “essay in persuasion” and transform itself into a Systems Reforms Commission. The Plan panel then had envisaged that the Commission would restructure itself to build a larger network with opinion makers, produce thought papers and communicate more lucidly.
According to government officials, the PMO is keen that the new institution work closely with states, rather co-opt states, to take the country to the next level of development and reforms. The new institution, one official said, may be christened as the National Development Reforms Commission.
In his Independence Day address, Modi had said the Planning Commission was a very old system and will have to be changed a lot to meet the needs of changing times. “Sometimes it costs more to repair the old house, but, it gives us no satisfaction. Thereafter, we have a feeling that it would be better to construct a new house altogether and therefore within a short period, we will replace the Planning Commission.”
He envisaged the institution as a new body, a new soul with new thinking and direction. “…(It will work) to promote the aspirations of state governments seeking development, to empower the state governments and to empower the federal structure,” he had said.

Delhi Confidential: CountinggameBy: Express News Service | New Delhi |
Posted: December 3, 2014 2:15 am
Bhagwant Mann of the AAP had many Lok Sabha MPs in splits when he started counting the number of times the salutation “Puratchi Thalaivi” (Revolutionary Leader) was used by AIADMK’s P Kumar for his party’s chief J Jayalalithaa during a discussion on natural calamities in the Lower House Tuesday. The AIADMK MPs generously use the expression whenever they rise to speak up in the House. They also follow it up by thumping the desks whenever any of their fellow partymen utters the salutation. But on Tuesday, it was Mann who not just started counting the number of times Kumar said “Puratchi Thalaivi” (by gesturing the count with his fingers), he also engaged Moon Moon Sen, Satabdi Roy and some more Trinamool MPs to thump their desks each time the expression was uttered. At final count, Mann gestured that Kumar had used the words six times in his speech.
BJP’S BLOOPER
West Bengal BJP brought back Rituparno Ghosh, back from the dead, on Tuesday. It sent out a message saying Ghosh is joining the party, along with singer Kumar Sanu. An internationally acclaimed director, Ghosh died in May 2013. Trinamool was quick to grab the opportunity to lambast the BJP as a party which does not even know Bengal and its icons. Soon, a revised message came that had actress Rituparna Sengupta’s name instead of Ghosh. Interestingly, singer Kumar Sanu had also joined the BJP officially in May 2004 and had then said that he was attracted to the party because of former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
UNDER WATCH
Congress chief Sonia Gandhi is learnt to have told Congress Lok Sabha MPs to remain present in the House as much as possible. At a meeting of the party’s parliamentary affairs committee Tuesday, she is also learnt to have spoken about MPs going missing in the post-lunch session. The suggestion was welcomed given the fact that the party is yet to get its act together in the Lower House. But Rahul Gandhi was seen in the House only twice in this session. In the last Lok Sabha, Rahul’s attendance was less than 50 per cent.
EXPERT CALL
Looks like Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu wants ‘Metro Man’ E Sreedharan to be involved more in the present-day railway system. On Tuesday, Sreedharan was named head of yet another expert committee. The panel is entrusted with addressing the long-pending impasse over which alignment would be ideal for the crucial Katra-Banihal railway link of the long-delayed Kashmir rail project. The matter is also entangled in a court case. The committee would freshly deliberate the matter and advise the minister. Apart from Sreedharan, the panel has experts V K Raina, S C Gupta and B M Kheda.

Speaking on the occasion, Sudhanshu Pandey, joint secretary, department of commerce said, “Last few years have been tough on the pharma sector due to various issues and challenges with regards to regulatory norms. But we must address these challenges in the right spirit. It’s a long way for Indian pharma industry, but we are on the right track.”

Day after haramzaadon  BJP MPs told to watch theirwordsWritten by Pragya Kaushika | New Delhi |
Posted: December 3, 2014 2:14 am
The BJP was treading cautiously on Tuesday, a day after Union Minister Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti’s comment during a Delhi poll campaign sparked a controversy and created a furore in Parliament.
Sources in the BJP said a directive has been issued to all MPs to use restraint in their speeches while campaigning. The advice came after political parties disrupted proceedings at Parliament on Tuesday and demanded an apology from Niranjan Jyoti.
BJP sources said MPs have been reminded that they are no longer in the Opposition and thus they attract more attention.
A source said the directive from the party brass was on the lines of, “We are on Constitutional posts now and we should be civilised and also should show some restraint. Everybody, especially the media, is watching us and we should not use a language that many of us did when we were not in power. Now, we have to act responsibly as we are in power. We should remember we are campaigning in the capital.”
The MPs have also been asked to focus only on positives and not speak about the negatives of other political parties. “We should highlight positive achievements of our Central government and not delve too much into the negatives of what other parties did to the capital. We should focus our energy on promises that we can make to the people. Engage with them,” high command is learnt to have told the MPs.
MPs started taking part in the Delhi campaign after party president Amit Shah directed them to do so while Parliament is in session.
Party sources said Delhi BJP unit has also been asked to be cautious about allocating areas to MPs who are available for the campaigning.
“The BJP leaders are now treading cautiously on allocating areas to MPs. It has become a sensitive issue,” a senior BJP leader said.

Fuel excise hiked  pricesunchangedBy: ENS Economic Bureau | New Delhi |
Posted: December 3, 2014 2:13 am
Facing the uphill task of reining in the fiscal deficit, the government on Tuesday raised the excise duties on petrol by Rs 2.25 per litre and on diesel by Rs 1 per litre with immediate effect to shore up revenue collection. This is the second such hike in two months.
The first hike was done in mid-November in order to reap the benefit of falling international oil prices. On November 12, the government had raised the excise duty by Rs 1.50 per litre on both petrol and diesel. However, the move did not have any impact on end users. In view of the declining prices of crude, oil marketing companies had on Monday cut petrol price by 91 paise a litre, the seventh reduction since August, and diesel by 84 paise per litre, the third consecutive reduction.
The government is expected to generate an additional revenue of about Rs 4,000 crore in the remaining period of the current fiscal, official sources said adding that the current hike will also have no impact on the retail prices.
“Duty hike is unlikely to lead to any increase in retail fuel prices. Falling international oil prices have given the government cushion to raise duty,” the source said.
The step is a measure to give a fillip to contracting excise duty collection, which contracted 0.6 per cent during the April-September period.

Insurance bill may get RS nod as Cong softensstandBy: Express News Service | New Delhi |
Posted: December 3, 2014 2:13 am
The prospects of the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill clearing the Rajya Sabha seem to have brightened, with Congress sources indicating that differences between the ruling BJP and the principal opposition party have narrowed down.
Congress representatives at the Rajya Sabha select committee meeting Tuesday seemed to be going along with the provisions of the Bill. However, they insisted on the incorporation of their suggestion to keep the foreign direct investment and foreign institutional investors separately defined.
Among representatives of other parties attending the meeting, Derek O’Brien of Trinamool Congress staged a walkout, while P Rajeev of the CPM and K C Tyagi of the JD(U) objected to some key clauses of the Bill.
The 15-member committee, headed by senior BJP member Chandan Mitra, is required to submit a final report by December 12. The panel is scheduled to meet again Wednesday.
Congress sources said an agreement (with the BJP) was likely given the likelihood of the acceptance of its suggestion to keep FDI and FII separately defined so that the foreign money which came in did not breach the sectoral cap of 49 per cent.
On Tuesday, the committee undertook a clause-by-clause examination of the bill and official amendments. As many as 49 of the 111 clauses were discussed. O’Brien walked out after complaining that the list did not contain all the amendments suggested by the 20-odd witnesses. Mitra overruled his his objection. Later, while speaking to The Indian Express, O’Brien said he would table the amendment that was missed out when the committee meets next. “Then, today’s meeting will become infructuous,” he said.
Regarding Congress’s reported willingness to explore middle ground on the Bill, O’Brien said: “The BJP took a U-turn and the Congress decided to ride pillion”.
CPM’s P Rajeev primarily objected to clause III of the bill, which seeks to enhance the FDI cap from 26 per cent to 49 per cent, and official amendment number 8, which deals with foreign institutional investors.
Tyagi reminded the committee of the recommendations of the Standing Committee on Finance, headed by BJP leader Yashwant Sinha, in December 2011. The panel had rejected the government’s proposal to hike the FDI cap, saying this could expose the economy to global vulnerability.

Cabinet clears changes in Companies Act to better ease of doingbizBy: ENS Economic Bureau | New Delhi |
Posted: December 3, 2014 2:12 am
In a bid to improve ease of doing business in India, the government on Tuesday cleared a host of significant amendments to the new Companies Act, 2013, attempting to do away with thorny issues.
In a meeting on Tuesday, the Cabinet also cleared changes to ensure severe punishment for those raising illegal deposits from the public.
Soon after taking over, the BJP-led government had assured that the concerns of the industry regarding the Act will be addressed. Commerce minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who was earlier holding ministry of corporate affairs (MCA) as well, had said that several hindrances can be removed by just amending certain provisions of the Act for improving the business environment of the country.
The 14 odd provisions cleared by the Cabinet include a breather to auditors regarding their responsibility of reporting frauds to the government. The Centre has defined materiality of fraud in terms of percentage or absolute value as a threshold above which the auditors would be required to report to the government. Below that threshold, the auditors will need not report to the government. As per the current provision, the auditors have to report all frauds to the secretary, MCA, adding to the compliance cost.
Further, the norms regarding related-party transactions (RPT) have also been relaxed. The current provision under Section 188 (1) says that RPTs of specified nature require approval by a board resolution or special resolution. It also bars a related-party member of the company from voting on special resolution. The Cabinet has done away with this for situations where, say, holding companies and their wholly owned subsidiaries are involved. Also, resolutions passed by the companies’ boards would not be subjected to public inspection, as required currently.

Speaker suspends Sivankutty for one day

Tweet
Four other LDF MLAs warned for disrupting House proceedings
V. Sivankutty was suspended from the Assembly for a day and four other Left Democratic Front MLAs warned for indiscipline on Tuesday for forcing their way to the Speaker’s dais and disrupting the proceedings by raising slogans.
The drama unfolded while Home Minister Ramesh Chennithala was replying to Leader of the Opposition V.S. Achuthanandan’s submission for filing an FIR and registering a case against Finance Minister K.M. Mani who is facing bribery charges from bar owners. Mr. Achuthanandan accused the government of ignoring a letter he had given to Vigilance Director Vinson M. Paul demanding a probe against Mr. Mani and other Ministers involved in the bribery row. Mr. Chennithala instead ordered for a quick verification.
Mr. Achuthanandan said Chief Minister Oommen Chandy and Mr. Chennithala also tried to absolve Mr. Mani in advance, for destroying evidence and sabotaging the probe. Mr. Chennithala responded that the letter was based on news reports and did not have sufficient facts for initiating legal action. The quick verification was ordered by Mr. Paul. Deputy Leader of the Opposition Kodiyeri Balakrishnan also accused Mr. Chandy and Mr. Chennithala of clearing the charges levelled against Mr. Mani. Mr. Chennithala said the meeting only declared political solidarity with Mr. Mani. LDF members T.V. Rajesh, Babu M. Palissery, R. Rajesh, P. Sreeramakrishnan, James Mathew, A. Pradeep Kumar, Chittayama Gopakumar and G.S. Jayalal led by Mr. Sivankutty stepped onto the dais, surrounded Deputy Speaker N. Sakthan and started raising slogans through the mike. Mr. Sakthan then suspended the proceedings, at 11 a.m.
On resuming business at 12.22 p.m., Mr. Sakthan announced the decision to suspend Mr. Sivankutty and warn four others. Opposition members then moved to the well of the House and raised slogans in protest. The House was then adjourned for the day at 12.30 p.m.

Should a kids menu include mocktailsBy Maura Judkis December 2 Follow @MauraJudkis
Kids love chicken fingers, french fries and burgers, but many parents have long been fed-up with the unhealthy and monotonous offerings on kids' menus , beige foods that can stymie the development of a well-rounded palate. But, as we reported in October , some restaurants have been creating kids' menus that are closer to their grown-up counterparts. Harth is one of them: The McLean Tysons Corner Hilton restaurant announced yesterday the debut of a "Foodie-in-Training" menu, with dishes such as celeraic soup and a fish of the day.

But one section of the menu , intended for children ages 10 and younger, is perhaps a bit too sophisticated. Kids at the restaurant won't just eat like their parents: If they order from the kids' mocktail menu, they'll drink like them too. The apple snap (apple cider, fresh lemon, homemade ginger beer), and the "no-jito" (white cranberry & apple juice, muddled mint, lime, soda) are $7 each.
To be clear, this is a labeling issue. Kids have been drinking Shirley Temples for decades, but you don't often see them labeled "mocktail," with its suggestion of alcohol, on a kids menu. They're just called drinks.
But hey, maybe after a tough day at kindergarten, your 5-year-old wants to knock one back. I bet he or she can drink you under the table. (Literally, sitting under the table playing with toys after getting a sugar buzz from these drinks.) Start 'em young!

Energy shares lead Wall St. higher in broad advanceDow, S&P 500 edge up as energy shares rebound; Nasdaq slips
By Caroline Valetkevitch, Reuters
CVS Health
The Dow and S&P 500 were holding onto small gains in volatile trading Tuesday afternoon, helped by a rebound in energy shares and investor bets the Federal Reserve will be cautious in removing support in the face of a more fragile global economy.

But both indexes were well off their highs for the day, with consumer discretionary shares the biggest drag on the S&P, while the Nasdaq was lower. Shares of Amazon were down 2.5 percent.
The S&P 500 moved more than 40 points from its high of the day to its low.

This article has scant reference to the biggest story on the international scene today, the free fall of the Russian Rouble now at 79 to the dollar, up from the 30s just a short time ago. BBC said today, "Russia's rouble went into free-fall in Tuesday trading, falling repeatedly to...

Futures crumbled in early trading as the ruble neared 80 per U.S. dollar, down 21 percent. The Russian currency sharply pared its losses and was down about 3 percent, near 68 per dollar.
Brent crude fell as much as 4.2 percent but was last down 2.3 percent at $59.65 a barrel. U.S. crude, which fell as much as 4.1 percent, was last down 31 cents at $55.60.
Still the S&P energy index was up 1.6 percent, leading gains on the S&P 500, as investors snapped up beaten down shares. The index is down 15.6 percent for the year so far following a sharp selloff in oil prices since June.
"There were many, many stocks, especially in the energy sector that were just trading at absolutely ridiculous prices to their fair market valuation," said Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in Charlotte, Vermont.
At 1:43PM the Dow Jones industrial average rose 64.46 points, or 0.38 percent, to 17,245.3, the S&P 500 gained 5.82 points, or 0.29 percent, to 1,995.45 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 4.18 points, or 0.09 percent, to 4,600.98.
Chevron, up 2.6 percent, was leading the points advance in the sector. Chevron's forward price-to-earnings ratio was at 13.6 at the close on Monday, compared to the S&P 500's 16.1, meaning investors pay less for every dollar of Chevron's earnings than they do for the S&P 500 overall.
Among the top percentage gainers, Nabors Industries, up 7.6 percent, had a forward P/E of 8.6, while Denbury Resources' P/E was 8.9. Denbury rose 8.4 percent.
Market participants also said bets on the Federal Reserve's next move were giving stocks support. Fed officials will decide this week whether to make a critical change to their policy statement that would widen the door for interest rate hikes next year. In October, The Fed repeated that benchmark rates were unlikely to rise for a "considerable time."
CVS Health Corp rose 3.8 percent to $94.14 after issuing a strong 2015 forecast. 3M lifted its dividend and was the top points gainer on the Dow industrials with a 2.2 percent advance. Boeing, up 2.3 percent, was among the best performers after it raised its dividend and perked up its buyback program.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,841 to 1,188, for a 1.55-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,601 issues rose and 1,081 fell for a 1.48-to-1 ratio.

Thanks. I guess to each his own (or her own). There are several ways to trade and profit from markets. You seem comfortable with your analysis and your methods so keep going. Instead of following others, it is always better to create your own strategy - one that you believe in and can follow all the way.
The RBI policy announcement was pretty much in line with the general consensus; which was no rate change but a positive tone. In fact, it would have been concerning if there were a rate cut because then the economy could have easily spiraled back into high inflation and low growth situation. Basically, it would have been "premature" as Rajan puts it.
Global concerns will remain. In September, Draghi cut of all policy rates bringing the headline rate down to another historic low of 0.05% and the deposit rate to -0.20%. Both rates were lowered by 10 basis points from previous levels. At that time he announced that the central bank was readying for Asset-Backed Securities (ABSs) and Covered Bonds purchases programme. Operation details came in October and November. In November`s policy meeting the Bank said that it started purchasing covered bonds under our new programme in Oct and it will also soon start to purchase ABS. The programmes will last for at least two years. Together with the series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations to be conducted until June 2016. As ECB positions itself for a full-scale quantitative easing program the regions should benefit from increased liquidity. With this aggressive monetary package, ECB became the first major central bank to impose a negative bank deposit rate so as to spur lending activity to credit-starved businesses. Now we all know what QE programs have achieved in US and Japan. The move should also help stabilize our currency as the US Fed positions to increase its interest rates sometime next year.
But again I am not so worried about external factors. I know I have a wallet that has market price of Rs 520, but only few people know it has Rs 200 in it. So I am basically getting a discount.
Anyway good luck with your strategy.

How to store your car for winter0
Maintaining the battery's charge makes more sense here. Choose a smart charger. Once the battery is fully charged, a smart charger (or battery maintainer), cycles on and off, allowing the battery to discharge slightly, then bringing it back to full charge. Dumb trickle chargers can overcharge and damage the battery.
Moisture may collect in the muffler and exhaust system, especially if you don't fully warm the car to cook the moisture out of the exhaust system. This typically happens if you start your car periodically during storage. If your muffler does not already have a weep hole, make one in the lowest spot using a 1/8-inch drill. Even though the exhaust system may be stainless steel, it won't last forever.
To keep vermin out of the engine compartment, generously spray the engine compartment with a rodent repellent. The jury is still out on whether mothballs or toilet deodorant tablets keep critters away. Although some people suggest poisons like D-Con, we think the risk (and the odor) of finding a dead animal would be unpleasant. Stuff some steel wool in the tailpipe and air cleaner intake to prevent animals from entering and setting up house.
Inside the car, clean and treat leather to keep it supple. Treat any vinyl surfaces for the same reason as well as to reduce out-gassing — the evaporation of certain polymers that keep it supple (and make the windshield smeary). Leave the windows open just a crack to allow air circulation, but not so much than any animals can get in.
We have heard that some people hang a light bulb inside the car to keep it dry, but we feel this is a dangerous practice. We prefer silica gel to absorb moisture, which could lead to mold or mildew. To keep the interior from smelling musty, place some trays of activated charcoal in the footwells.
To keep the wiper blade edges from being deformed, lift the wiper arms just enough to place small wood blocks under them. If your wipers can lock in the upright position, you may choose to do that, but it makes it hard to cover the car.
If you want to cover your vehicle, do not use one of those cheap blue plastic tarps from the home center store. You need a breathable cover that will protect the paint yet allow moisture to escape. Outdoors, a cover shields against the sun's damaging UV rays, acid rain and animals that may frolic on your Ford. During indoor storage, a cover protects the car from airborne contaminants and animals' frisky feet.
Do not set the parking brake. Not only is it unnecessary, the cables could seize or the brakes may not release properly when you take the car out of storage.
Finally, to avoid flat spots on the tires, you may want to raise the car and place jack stands under all four corners.

The tastes of American Internet-users are both well-known and much-derided: Cat videos. Personality quizzes. Lists of things that only people from your generation/alma mater/exact geographic area "understand."
But in France, it turns out, even viral-content fiends are a bit more . . . sophistiques.

"In France, articles about cats do not work," Buzzfeed's Scott Lamb told Le Figaro, a leading Parisian paper. Instead, he explained, Buzzfeed's first year in the country has shown it that "the French love sharing news and politics on social networks — in short, pretty serious stuff."
This is interesting for two reasons: first, as conclusive proof that the French are irredeemable snobs; second, as a crack in the glossy, understudied facade of what we commonly call "Internet culture."
When The New York Times' David Pogue tried to define the term in 2009, he ended up with a series of memes: the "Star Wars" kid, the dancing baby, rickrolling, the exploding whale. Likewise, if you look to anyone who claims to cover the Internet culture space — not only Buzzfeed, but Mashable, Gawker and, yeah, yours truly — their coverage frequently plays on what Lamb calls the "cute and positive" theme. They're boys who work at Target and have swoopy hair, videos of babies acting like "tiny drunk adults,"hamsters eating burritos and birthday cakes.
That is the meaning we've assigned to "Internet culture," itself an ambiguous term: It's the fluff and the froth of the global Web.
But Lamb's observations on Buzzfeed's international growth would actually seem to suggest something different. Cat memes and other frivolities aren't the work of an Internet culture. They're the work of an American one.

Orient-Express rejection proves to be a blessing in disguise for TataOrient-Express rejection proves to be a blessing in disguise for Tata
Swaraj Baggonkar | Mumbai Dec 03, 2014 12:47 AM IST
Rejecting the buy-out offers made by India’s largest hotel company twice has proved to be a rueful decision for Bermuda-based Belmond and a boon for Tata group-promoted Indian Hotels Company (IHCL).
Belmond’s rejection of the $1.2-billion unsolicited takeover bid by Indian Hotels Company two years ago, saying the offer was ‘too cheap’, has proved to be a costly affair for the former. The Tata group company’s offer of $12.63 a share for Orient-Express Hotels, later rebranded as Belmond, made in 2012, still beats the company’s Friday traded price of $11.32 a share on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
In each of the six succeeding years from the time Indian Hotels Company and its subsidiary Samsara Properties invested in Belmond (formerly Orient-Express Hotels) back in 2007, the struggling NYSE-listed company has only posted losses. Last year, Indian Hotels officially withdrew its offer more than a year after it was rejected for the second time.
Mounting losses innately disallowed the company to reward its shareholders during the period with the last dividend paid more than six years ago. Belmond has been selling properties to reduce its debt burden, which stood at $621 million at the end of September quarter.
Bermuda-based Belmond has 45 hotels, trains and river cruises spread across Americas, Europe, Asia and Africa. The company has been facing challenges.
For instance, the average age of its guests is 55 years and only three per cent of its guests have stayed at more than one property. Many of its historically-significant properties such as the one in Venice are in need of investments for upgrades.
Although both companies are very different in their business operations, their market capitalisation is at par with each other. While Indian Hotels had a market capitalisation of Rs 8,975 crore as of last Friday, Belmond had a market capitalisation of Rs 8,494 crore. While IHCL operates through four brands stretching from luxury to budget hotels, Belmond operates only its own brand, which is luxury.
IHCL, which was planning to take over Belmond through a mix of debt and equity, is battling its own debt pile made worse by a weak global operation from where 40 per cent of its revenues come.
At the moment, the company is sitting on a debt of Rs 3,300 crore.
In addition, fighting competition at home against global giants such as Marriott, Hyatt, Accor, Starwoods and Intercontinental has led to pressure on revenues due to discounts offered. It was forced to sell a prized property, the Blue Sydney in Australia, earlier this year to use the proceeds to cut debt.
Although with a significantly reduced stake, IHCL still holds 6.9 per cent stake in Belmond's class shares.
IHCL did not participate in the numerous rights issue Belmond came out with after the target company decided for a new class of non-traded shares that control majority of the voting rights, leaving the listed shares with very little control of the company.
A mail sent to Indian Hotels Company seeking clarity on its future plans with regard to its stake in Belmond remained unanswered. IHCL made total investments of Rs 1,200 crore in picking up shares of Orient-Express Hotels.
However, the owner of brands such as Taj, Vivanta By Taj, Gateway and Ginger, took an impairment hit of more than Rs 700 crore on its investments in Belmond.

Locks and hinges: A graphite-based or synthetic lubricant is recommended for locks, oil for hinges. Squirt on door, hood, trunk hinges and hood latch/release mechanism.
Tires and brakes: Install winter tires on all four wheels or rotate your all season tires. Inspect the brake pads or shoes while tires are off. If rotors of drums are scored or worn, replace them. Check the air pressure on all tires, including the spare. In winter, tires lose 1 pound of pressure for each 10-degree drop in temperature. Look for worn or uneven treads.
Paint: Use automotive touchup paint to seal any scratches or dings. After washing the car, protect the finish and give it a solid shine by waxing.
Lights and light bulbs: Turn the lights on and walk around the vehicle to check for burned-out bulbs. Have a friend sit inside and operate the brakes, turn signals and flashers. Do not forget the high beams. Make sure your headlights are properly aimed. Owner's manuals list replacement bulbs.
Interior
Windows: Clean with vinegar and water or automotive glass cleaner to cut through the dirt and haze; it may take a few times to end streaking. Check your defroster and rear window defogger.
Floor mats: For winter, substitute carpet remnants, which can be placed under a tire for added traction when stuck in snow. Consider deep rubber mats to collect melting snow.
Upholstery: Clean the seats top to bottom and apply protectant to all leather, vinyl and fabric.

SBI chief Arundhati Bhattacharya says banks get little from money market to cut rates

(Terming today's monetary…)
MUMBAI: With RBI chief Raghuram Rajan blaming banks for high interest rates and not transmitting the money market benefits, top lender SBI countered the charge and said that banks get very little resources from this market.
"Banks get very little resources from the money market. For instance, SBI does not have a single CD (Certificate of Deposit) in the market and so to that extent the rates coming down in the money market won't really impact us. Therefore, there is no question of transmission.
"My resources are deposits and not money market instruments. I have no CDs in the market and so transmission from my side doesn't come in at all," Arundhati Bhattacharya, SBI Chairperson, told reporters at an event here when asked to comment on Rajan's view.
She said Governor was talking about the money market where there has been some softening in the rates.
At the press meet after the policy meeting, where he left all key rates unchanged, Rajan blamed banks for the prevailing high interest rates despite a steep fall in money market rates thereby preventing monetary transmission.
He also termed India Inc's repeated calls for lower rates as a myopic way of looking at growth-inflation dynamics and asserted that the central bank is all for the "strongest possible growth".
Explaining her view further, Bhattacharya said sentiment is a very important piece in the whole monetary policy framework.
"I think there is a lot of liquidity in the system and very little credit demand, so there will be transmission going forward. When there is very little liquidity and also if inflation is high and you are not able to bring down deposits rates, then transmission becomes difficult.
"But when inflation is low, you can bring down deposit rates, liquidity is ample, credit growth is not great, then transmission is bound to happen," the SBI chief said.
Terming today's monetary policy statement as "pretty dovish," Bhattacharya expressed the hope that low interest rate regime is closer than expected.
"The Governor has left the window open which means that it (rate cut) could happen at any point of time. Also the expectations as they have put out...the inflation band from 11 per cent to 4 per cent, clearly, the expectations are disinflationary and so they are also convinced that the downward trend is entrenched," Bhattacharya said.

In Defense of College: What Peter Thiel Gets Wrong  Once Againreddit
In a Washington Post opinion piece , billionaire Peter Thiel asserts that college is the final stage of a competitive tournament in which kids at the top enjoy prestige because they've defeated everybody else. He claims that college education is a bubble and doesn't provide more value than an insurance policy; that the college admissions process is all that is important because it anoints an "already-proven hypercompetitive elite."
Thiel is mistaken on all fronts.
If indeed the value came from the college admissions filter, employers would simply replicate this by requiring applicants to supply the same material required by admissions offices: SAT scores and high-school records. They would hire former college admissions officers to assist in hiring, or recruit freshmen who have been admitted to a selective col­lege. After all, that is what pro­fessional sports leagues do: hire play­ers as soon as league rules allow. Why wait for them to graduate if college education is just a waste of time and money?
In a paper titled " Our Colleges and Universities Failing Us ," Stanford's Provost, John Etchemendy, postulated that if employers were primarily using college as a signal of general intel­ligence, as well perhaps as the ambition to apply and get into a selective college, we would see much more hiring behavior like that of professional sports leagues. We would surely not see a premium for college education unless it provided real value.
The facts are that college graduates earn more than those who do not go to college and that the gap is increasing. A study by Daron Acemoglu and David Autor found that the earnings of the average college graduate in 2008 exceeded those of the average high-school graduate by 97 percent. Another study , by Carnevale, Rose and Cheah, estimated that the projected median lifetime earnings of those with a bachelor's degree are 74 percent higher than the earnings of those with just a high-school diploma, and that there was a premium on tertiary education in almost every line of work, even those that do not require a college degree. For example, food-service managers and retail salespersons -- occupations open even to those with no high-school diploma -- benefit from a college education: in these roles, workers with a bachelor's degree earn between 50 and 65 percent more than those with only a high-school diploma.
It isn't that employers are being delusional in paying higher wages to workers with a higher education, Etchemendy explains. They are rewarding traits and skills that are acquired or honed during college, as well as intangibles such as general intelligence and persistence.
Four years ago, Thiel launched a fellowship to pay students $100,000 each to drop out of college. He claimed that, enabled to bypass college, gifted students would create "breakthrough technologies that will take civilization to the next level." The Thiel Foundation has, to date, failed to produce even a single world-changing company, despite having funded nearly one hundred exceptional students who came up with their ideas while they were still in college -- as did Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, and Bill Gates, the most famous dropouts of all. It is telling that an early-stage fund that Thiel later launched, Breakout Labs, invests in start-ups mostly led by teams of academics, including PhDs and research scientists -- not by college dropouts.
College teaches basic skills such as management, finance, and communications. It also teaches students how to interact and work with others, make compromises, deal with rejection and failure, and learn. It inculcates ethics and social values. That is why Jobs, Zuckerberg and Gates extolled the virtues of higher education and encouraged children to finish college -- and why their companies rarely hire college dropouts. As well, entrepreneurship is hard enough for people with experience, maturity, and connections. For the vast majority of young people, gambling their future on a high-risk entrepreneurial venture is ill-advised, because they will not have developed the basic skills and values necessary to success.
Thiel and others have raised the alarm about the growing student-debt burden. They play on stories of students borrowing more than $100,000 to fi­nance their bachelor's degree. These are true stories, but the examples are rare. In fact, in 2007-08, the median debt nation wide of graduating seniors at non-profit colleges and universities was roughly $10,000, and 36 percent graduated with no debt at all. At one of the most expensive universities in the country, Stanford, students graduated with less than $5,000 average debt, and 77 percent of the Class of 2013 graduated debt-free. Of the 23 percent who graduated with some debt, the median amount of debt was $13,000.
If indeed investment in college is a bubble, it is the longest-lived bubble in economic history," said Etchemendy in an e-mail to me. "College graduates have earned more than high-school graduates as long as comparative wage data has been available, and for the most part it has steadily widened as technology has become a more essential part of the workplace. And this is no accident, technology increases economic productivity, but its invention, operation, and maintenance requires high-level skills obtained through education," he added.
The reality is that we are no longer preparing our children to work in factories; we are readying them for today's knowledge-based economy. This requires mastery of a wide assortment of technical skills, ability to work in groups, and continual learning. With accelerating technology advances, careers no longer last a lifetime. Entire industries will be decimated and new ones created within years -- not the centuries it took in previous generations. Constant reinvention is required, for which higher education provides the foundation.
There surely is a competitive tournament, but it takes place on a global scale: whichever country has the most highly educated workforce benefits. How much so? The Milken Institute documented that for each additional year of college education that the average worker in a region receives, the per-capita GDP of the region increases by a remarkable 17.4 percent and the region's average worker's wages are boosted by 17.8 percent. To put it starkly: Thiel's prescriptions are a race to the bottom of the global economic ladder.

Cause Celeb: Tom Colicchio lobbies Hill on food labelingBy Emily Heil December 2 Follow @emilyaheil
Chef Tom Colicchio speaks at a news conference on Capitol Hill. (Emily Heil/The Washington Post)
Celeb: Move over Clooney. Chef/restaurateur/”Top Chef” host Tom Colicchio is getting to be one of the most visible famous faces advocating for a cause in Washington. The James Beard award-winner is as serious about food policy as he about the marbling of his famed steaks.
He’s formed a nonprofit organization, Food Policy Action, lobbied Congress on the farm bill, and is looking at school lunches as the next frontier. But his mix of equal parts celebrity and activism recently got a bad review, when a Wall Street Journal opinion column  urged him to “stick to [his] pots and pans.”
As Colicchio, looking intense during a Tuesday visit to Capitol Hill in a fitted suit and power tie, geared up for a day of lobbying, it seemed there was little chance of that happening.
Cause: Labeling of genetically-modified foods, specifically a bill espousing a customer’s “right to know” whether the food they purchase has had its DNA tinkered with.
Scene: A group of 26 chefs (including boldface toques like Jose Andres, Art Smith, and “Top Chef” contestant Sam Talbot) hit the Hill for meetings with dozens of lawmakers. The groups started things off with breakfast and lobbying training session at nearby Bearnaise (nothing like some eggs Benny to fuel you up for arm-twisting), which is owned by another T.C. alum, Spike Mendelsohn. Then it was on to a news conference, where they and Sen. John Tester (D-Mont.) were peppered (get it?) with food-policy questions before making their way around the marble halls to meet with senators and congressfolk.
Soundbite: Colicchio clearly is fluent in the ways of Washington, name-checking a well-known trade reporter, invoking concern for his own children, and making the issue out to be a common-sense solution.
“Labels that are used for marketing purposes are purposely done to confuse the consumer,” he said during the presser. “This is about giving consumer the knowledge to not be confused when they go to the marketplace to shop for their families.”

5 once-popular cars killed off with 'final editions'

LOS ANGELES -- Mitsubishi's Lancer Evolution remains one of the hottest-performing small cars on the market, but its heat hasn't extended to sales lately.
Mitsubishi officials said last week at the Los Angeles Auto Show that they're going to kill off the little Evo after the 2015 model year. But don't fret if you want one. It's one of the models from various makers celebrating their final years with long goodbyes designed to squeeze  a few more sales from nostalgic advocates.
They are usually classed as  "final editions."
Whether it's Volkswagen saying "adios" to the Eos hardtop convertible or Mercedes-Benz offering a "so long" to the AMG SLS brute, automakers are embracing a get-'em-before-they're-gone philosophy.
It's up to buyers to decide whether a model is, indeed, going away.
Mercedes turned right and created a new near-supercar, the Mercedes-AMG GT, to fill the void being left by the AMG SLS. Mazda sold out of 25th anniversary MX-5 Miatas earlier this year, but now has shown a shapely next-generation MX-5 Miata.
But often automakers just kill vehicle names outright and create for these a last, very public bow. Models on their last legs:
•Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution. The Evo will bow out next summer after a "special action model" is offered as a swan song. "It's a great 'halo" for for the brand, says  Don Swearingen, Mitsubishi's executive vice president in the U.S., of the Evo. "but at the end of the day, we only sell about 200 a month." Mitsu will move instead to hot-performing plug-in cars.
•Volkswagen Eos. The slope-backed steel droptop was a design marvel when it was introduced, but it has lagged on its high price. To make the Final Edition a "going out of business" deal at $39,985 including destination charges, VW has pounded on extras such as 18-inch allow wheels, backup camera and heated 12-way power seats.
"The decision to name the Eos 'Final Edition' was based on a desire to recognize the model for its unique content while celebrating the value it has brought to the VW lineup over the years," says spokesman Darryll Harrison. The naming protocol "has become a little bit of a tradition with some of our models."
•Mercedes-Benz AMG SLS. The supercar with nostalgic upward-opening "gullwing" doors became a favorite of car magazines as soon as it went on sale in 2010 because of its blistering performance and heritage.
The "Final Edition" made its debut at the auto shows last year, and the final run is limited to 350 units globally. A few remain "but are basically sold out," says Mercedes spokesman Christian Bokich.
As high-impact supercars go, though, it's being looked upon as a success. "The SLS definitely has a key place in automotive history and has gracefully exited the marketplace," he says.
•Toyota FJ Cruiser. Toyota says it built 2,500 of what it called the Trail Teams Ultimate Edition Cruiser as a swan song for the distinctive off-road vehicle.
The final FJ "pays tribute to the iconic Land Cruiser FJ40 of the 1960s, from which the FJ Cruiser draws its rugged DNA, inspiration and design," Toyota says.
"We created the Ultimate Edition to give the FJ a proper send off," says Sam Butto, a Toyota spokesman.
•Cadillac CTS-V Coupe. Cadillac said it would build 500 "limited edition" CTS-V performance cars based on the last-generation CTS for a 2015 model year even though a new V-Series is on its way for 2016.
Cadillac says the outgoing model is a way of celebrating the characteristics that defined the 2010 to 2014 models -- a 556-horsepower supercharged V-8 engine, Brembo brakes and magnetic-ride control.
But it is only a "stepping stone" to the next generation, Cadillac says.

Rob Portman would probably be a good president. Hed never get elected though.By Chris Cillizza December 2 Follow @thefix
Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, center, speaks with reporters. (AP Photo)
Ohio Republican Sen . Rob Portman announced Tuesday morning that he would forego a presidential bid in 2016 in order to run for reelection.  “With the new Republican majority, I see a real opportunity over the next two years to break the gridlock in Washington and actually get things done to help Ohioans and all Americans," he said in a statement announcing the decision. "That's where I believe I can play the most constructive role. I don't think I can run for president and be an effective senator at the same time."
That's the right call by Portman -- but not necessarily for the reasons he outlined. (Also on Tuesday, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who is going to run for president, announced he is seeking reelection to the Senate too .) The truth of the matter is that Portman's odds of being the 2016 presidential nominee were hovering in that space between "very very slim" and "absolutely none at all".  And, it's not because Portman is too moderate -- he supports same sex marriage and is generally a centrist in terms of his legislative approach. It's because he's a governance guy, not a campaign guy.
The truth of politics is that it is largely split into two camps: People who are good at the governance side of things and those who are good at the campaign side. The lines are not absolute, of course, and, on rare occasions the country produces a politician who can do both at a very high level. (For Democrats, that's Bill Clinton. For Republicans, it's Ronald Reagan.)
The governance people tend to be efficient and effective managers, usually quiet types who are smart operators that everyone wants on their team.  The campaign people are the charismatic ones, less versed (typically) in policy and management but able to inspire and lead through the force of their personality and their rhetoric.  If you think hard enough about it (and, in truth, you don't even need to think that hard) you can divvy up almost every politician currently on the national stage into one of those two groups.
Take the Republican field. Jeb Bush is the governance type. Rand Paul, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio are the campaign type.  (Just to reiterate: This does not mean that Jeb is ALL governance or Rubio or Rand are ALL campaign.  But, if you had to push them into one of the two categories, those are the ones where they most naturally fit.)
Portman is one of the best "governance" types in recent memory.  Look at his resume: 12 years in the U.S. House, head of the Office of Management and Budge, U.S. Trade Representative, Senator.  Packed into that resume is Portman's status as the guy-who-plays-Barack-Obama-in-mock-debates and his time in the 2014 election as the chief fundraiser for the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
The guy -- whether you agree or disagree with his politics or not -- is demonstrably hyper-competent. During his relatively brief period as a potential 2016 candidate, I talked to several Democrats who acknowledged that Portman would likely be a solid president -- ideology aside. (They also all noted, correctly, that Portman could never win an open primary contest to be the party's nominee.)
Portman's problem is that being a measured, reasonable legislator who excels in the sort of deal-making that was once the lifeblood of Congress is not exactly the stuff of inspirational stump speeches in Iowa. Or the kind of thing that fires up base conservatives in New Hampshire or South Carolina.
We elect campaigners president more often than not.  Take 2012.  Mitt Romney, in his heart of hearts, was a governance guy. He liked taking over big organizations -- the Winter Olympics, for one -- and figuring out ways large and small to make them better. But, he was in a campaign -- one in which he was badly outmatched by President Obama, who is more a campaign guy than a governing one. (Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, was a campaign guy too.)  Romney's awkwardness as a candidate was made even starker by Obama's ease on the trail.
That we are amazed when the campaign types we elect are, more often than not, less skilled at governance than they were at campaigning speaks to our tremendously short collective memory and our tendency to prize style over -- or at least equal to -- substance.
Portman is on the far end of the governance/substance side of the politicians' continuum.  And so, he never really had a chance at getting elected president in 2016.  That he was smart enough to see that reinforces his uber-governance credentials.

Much-needed rain drenches California  but hardly puts dent in droughtBy Jason Samenow December 2 Follow @capitalweather
Simulation of storm off of California coast (earth.nullschool.net)
A vigorous storm system off of California’s Pacific coast is pumping streams of moisture inland, depositing welcome rain in the drought-afflicted state.
The San Francisco Bay area has received 1-1.5 inches of rain so far today.  Through 11 a.m. Pacific time, 1.28 inches had fallen downtown, making it the 5th wettest day there since  2009 – according to Jan Null, a consulting meteorologist based in San Francisco.  Additional rain is likely this afternoon with daily amounts nearing 1.5 inches, which would make it the rainiest day since February 15, 2009.

The rain is helpful, but substantially more is needed to ease the drought. “The 3-season deficit for San Francisco at the beginning of the rainfall season was 26.07 inches,” writes Null. “If you add that to the 23.65 inches needed for this season to ultimately reach normal we would need 49.73 inches to be at ‘normal’.”
Around Los Angeles, 0.25-0.5 inches of rain has fallen thus far today, though parts of southern California have received substantially more, where it hasn’t necessarily been entirely beneficial.
“The season’s biggest rainstorm is lashing Southern California, bringing down power lines, flooding residential streets and closing park trails,” reports the LA Times .

More than 200 U.S. companies came together Tuesday to support a major reduction in carbon pollution from power plants proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency.
"As businesses concerned about the immediate and long-term implications of climate change, we strongly support the principles behind the draft carbon pollution standard for existing power plants," states a letter that was sent to the EPA, the Obama administration and congressional leaders.
Major brand names and Fortune 500 companies — including Kellogg's, Starbucks, Ikea, Levi Strauss and Nestlé — were among the 223 companies that signed the letter.
The proposed EPA rule aims to reduce carbon pollution from the nation's power plants by 30% from 2005 levels. It represents one of the most significant actions ever taken by the U.S. government to fight climate change. The public comment period for the plan ended Monday, and the EPA should announce a final rule next summer.
Carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels is the greenhouse gas that's most responsible for global warming, according to the near-unanimous conclusion of climate scientists.
"Our support is firmly grounded in economic reality," the letter states. "We know that tackling climate change is one of America's greatest economic opportunities of the 21st century, and we applaud the EPA for taking steps to help the country seize that opportunity."
Poll: 83% of Americans say climate is changing
"These companies recognize that the EPA's power plant rule is a critical step in mitigating climate risks and accelerating low-carbon technologies that hold enormous economic promise," said Mindy Lubber, president of the non-profit sustainability group Ceres, which helped organize the letter.
She added that there are some unfounded assumptions that environmental regulations are bad for the economy and bad for jobs, but the facts don't bear that out.
"Achieving the proposed carbon reductions from existing power plants through energy efficiency retrofits of existing buildings will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and our impact on the planet, reduce costs for both power companies and consumers, and help drive the economy by creating jobs," said Dan Probst, Chairman of Energy and Sustainability Services at JLL, a global real estate management and investment firm headquartered in Chicago.
As an example, Probst said that retrofitting old buildings in Illinois alone should create more than 7,000 jobs.
"We as a company believe we all need to play our part in moving toward a more low-carbon society and economy," said John Gardner, VP and Chief Sustainability Officer at Novelis, the world's largest manufacturer of rolled aluminum.
"It's a win economically and win environmentally," he said.
"As the world's largest food and beverage company, Nestlé places a great deal of importance on environmental responsibility," said Tim Brown, president and CEO of Nestlé Waters North America.  "Nestlé is 148 years old, and we want to be here for another 148 years," he said, and that's "dependent on a stable environment to operate in."
Other business groups don't see such a rosy picture: This week,  the Competitive Enterprise Institute and 11 other free-market organizations submitted their own public comments to the EPA, saying the Clean Power Plan would increase electricity prices and raise reliability concerns across the country.
According to CEI senior fellow Marlo Lewis, the Clean Power Plan is illegitimate and unlawful: "The plan's putative climate benefits are illusory — the regulation should be withdrawn."

Scott Van Pelt calls Bruce Allens Harvest Fest answer disingenuous  embarrassing and rudeBy Dan Steinberg December 2 Follow @dcsportsbog
(By Jonathan Newton / The Washington Post)
After several months out of the spotlight, Redskins GM Bruce Allen has gotten a bit of national publicity this week. Pro Football Talk did an Allen item :
President and General Manager Bruce Allen hasn’t said anything this season, and he won’t be saying anything until after the season ends. Dianna Marie Russini of NBC 4 in D.C. reports that she has asked for an opportunity to interview Allen, and that the team has declined the request. The team added that Allen will be available in the offseason.
Some have begun to wonder whether Allen should remain employed by the franchise in the offseason. The rare G.M. who was fired (in Tampa) and then resurfaced as a G.M. elsewhere, Allen arrived as the perceived table-setter for Shanahan. While apparently not running the show during the Shanahan tenure, the organization currently shows a smudgy cluster of his fingerprints.
ESPN.com’s John Keim did a Bruce Allen item :
For those wondering, many requests have been made to talk to general manager Bruce Allen about what’s transpired this season. They’ve been denied. Word is he’ll talk after the season. Yes, I still believe they need to hire a strong football man and let Allen just serve as team president.
And ESPN’s Scott Van Pelt did a Bruce Allen item on his national radio show. He began by explaining what happened in Allen’s pre-game interview with Redskins senior vice president Larry Michael . To recap that:
“What about the focus of this team?” Michael asked Allen at the end of the brief interview. “A lot of things off the field this week. Is this team ready to go?”
“Yeah, you know, we had a lot of great things off the field,” Allen responded. “We had the Harvest Fest at FedEx Field. We had a great event in Richmond on Friday helping some people who need some help. Our team is focused. We’re hungry for a win. And it’s going to be a tough challenge today.”
Now, some fans reacted negatively to that answer, since the question had concerned the benching of the franchise quarterback, and the answer had concerned something else entirely. Put Van Pelt in that category .
“Whatever the Redskins did to help some folks that needed food at Thanksgiving, that’s great,” Van Pelt said this week. “That’s understood. But you’re the GM of the team, and you’ve just been asked about your team’s focus, and you just talk about the Harvest Fest. It’s disingenuous, it’s embarrassing, it’s rude. And you’re the general manager of the team.
“Now, does anyone expect you to be as honest as Rich Rodriguez is when he’s asked a question?” Van Pelt said, explaining that no, that was not expected. “Allen could have said a hundred thing,” he went on: “It’s been a challenging week, but we’ve got faith in Robert, we’ve got faith in Colt, we’re going to see what happens. But we’re talking about Harvest Fest, and Richmond, and feeding people. And again, that’s great, but that’s not what you were asked. Just add this to the list of tone-deaf, idiotic things that this franchise does. Then they went out and gave up about 100 points. Hail to the Redskins.”

Shiv Sena moves closer to joining FadnavisgovtWritten by Shubhangi Khapre | Mumbai |
Posted: December 3, 2014 2:32 am | Updated: December 3, 2014 9:36 am
Three days after the two estranged allies resumed power-sharing talks, the Shiv Sena  Monday seemed set to join the BJP-led government, paving way for the expansion of Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis-led Cabinet which could take place as early as Friday.
Senior Sena leaders were huddled with the CM at his official residence in Mumbai till late Monday night. Early on Tuesday morning, Fadnavis left for Nagpur. Sources said the talks would resume after he returns.
The Shiv Sena is learnt to have given up its claim for deputy chief ministership and home department and agreed to a deal that gives the party 12 berths in the Cabinet, of them five are of Cabinet rank and the rest with the minister of state rank. The four important portfolios offered to Sena are industries, public works department, energy and water resources.
Shiv Sena MP Anil Desai said Tuesday, “Sena president Uddhav Thackeray has received a formal proposal from the BJP. CM Fadnavis and Thackeray are directly talking on the matter.” He said a formal decision would be announced in a few days.
At present, the Fadnavis cabinet has nine ministers. The total strength of his Cabinet is likely to be 36. Both the BJP and the Sena are said to have begun short-listing names of candidates to be inducted in the Cabinet.

Tough administrator  last of Congs old guard inMaharashtraBy: Express News Service | Mumbai |
Posted: December 3, 2014 2:31 am | Updated: December 3, 2014 11:37 am
The last of the old guard of the Congress party in Maharashtra, and an Indira Gandhi loyalist, former Maharashtra chief minister Abdul Rehman Antulay passed away in Mumbai on Tuesday morning. He was 85.
Antulay was the first chief minister of the state to have to battle a prolonged court case following the cement scandal that led to his exit from the top post, simultaneously marking the decline of his political career in Maharashtra, although he later served as minister for minority affairs in UPA-1.
The state declared a three-day mourning. The funeral will be held in his native district of Raigad Wednesday.
Antulay, the state’s first Muslim chief minister, headed the government between June 9, 1980 and January 12, 1982. But in this short time span, he left his mark as a decision-maker whom bureaucrats feared. In his condolence message, Governor C Vidyasagar Rao said although Antulay’s tenure as chief minister was brief, he was admired for efficiency and administrative acumen.
Known for his outspokenness, Antulay was a party loyalist who was handpicked by Indira Gandhi to lead Maharashtra. But he got embroiled in a controversy after the Bombay High Court ruled that he had illegally led builders in Mumbai to make donations to the India Gandhi Pratishthan trust, one of several trust funds he established, allegedly in exchange for extra cement than the quota allocated to them by the government.
In a series of articles, The Indian Express exposed the cement scam, leading to a case being filed in the court and the court subsequently indicting him. Following this, Antulay was forced to quit as chief minister in January 1982, when Indira Gandhi was the prime minister. Antulay fought a legal battle over this for more than a decade. He took up the matter in the Supreme Court and was acquitted due to lack of evidence. But by then his career in Maharashtra had waned. And he shifted to Delhi as a Lok Sabha MP.
Calling the veteran Congressman a “thoughtful and aggressive leader”, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said,  “Beginning his public life as a social worker, Antulay remained firm on his principles, and even took on the administration on occasions.”
Antulay was born in Ambet village in Raigad district. After graduation from Bombay University, he studied Barrister-At-Law at Lincoln’s Inn, London. He was married to Nargis and has a son and a daughter. His son Mushtaq is a Congress leader.
After the November 26, 2008 terror attack in Mumbai, he sparked a controversy, saying that the then ATS chief Hemant Karkare, who was killed in the attack, may have been targeted for his probe into the 2006 Malegaon blasts. Later, he told Parliament he had not been talking about who killed Karkare, but that Karkare may have been sent in the wrong direction. The Congress distanced itself from his statements.

Energy leads Wall St higher; Dow sets recordDow, S&P 500 edge up as energy shares rebound; Nasdaq slips
By Caroline Valetkevitch, Reuters
CVS Health
The Dow and S&P 500 were holding onto small gains in volatile trading Tuesday afternoon, helped by a rebound in energy shares and investor bets the Federal Reserve will be cautious in removing support in the face of a more fragile global economy.

But both indexes were well off their highs for the day, with consumer discretionary shares the biggest drag on the S&P, while the Nasdaq was lower. Shares of Amazon were down 2.5 percent.
The S&P 500 moved more than 40 points from its high of the day to its low.

Futures crumbled in early trading as the ruble neared 80 per U.S. dollar, down 21 percent. The Russian currency sharply pared its losses and was down about 3 percent, near 68 per dollar.
Brent crude fell as much as 4.2 percent but was last down 2.3 percent at $59.65 a barrel. U.S. crude, which fell as much as 4.1 percent, was last down 31 cents at $55.60.
Still the S&P energy index was up 1.6 percent, leading gains on the S&P 500, as investors snapped up beaten down shares. The index is down 15.6 percent for the year so far following a sharp selloff in oil prices since June.
"There were many, many stocks, especially in the energy sector that were just trading at absolutely ridiculous prices to their fair market valuation," said Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in Charlotte, Vermont.
At 1:43PM the Dow Jones industrial average rose 64.46 points, or 0.38 percent, to 17,245.3, the S&P 500 gained 5.82 points, or 0.29 percent, to 1,995.45 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 4.18 points, or 0.09 percent, to 4,600.98.
Chevron, up 2.6 percent, was leading the points advance in the sector. Chevron's forward price-to-earnings ratio was at 13.6 at the close on Monday, compared to the S&P 500's 16.1, meaning investors pay less for every dollar of Chevron's earnings than they do for the S&P 500 overall.
Among the top percentage gainers, Nabors Industries, up 7.6 percent, had a forward P/E of 8.6, while Denbury Resources' P/E was 8.9. Denbury rose 8.4 percent.
Market participants also said bets on the Federal Reserve's next move were giving stocks support. Fed officials will decide this week whether to make a critical change to their policy statement that would widen the door for interest rate hikes next year. In October, The Fed repeated that benchmark rates were unlikely to rise for a "considerable time."
CVS Health Corp rose 3.8 percent to $94.14 after issuing a strong 2015 forecast. 3M lifted its dividend and was the top points gainer on the Dow industrials with a 2.2 percent advance. Boeing, up 2.3 percent, was among the best performers after it raised its dividend and perked up its buyback program.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,841 to 1,188, for a 1.55-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,601 issues rose and 1,081 fell for a 1.48-to-1 ratio.

Govt appoints Anil Kumar Sinha CBI directorGovt appoints Anil Kumar Sinha CBI director
Press Trust Of India | New Delhi Dec 03, 2014 12:50 AM IST
Indian Police Service (IPS) officer Anil Kumar Sinha was on Tuesday night appointed the new Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) Director to succeed Ranjit Sinha, who retired with the Supreme Court directing him to recuse self from the 2G telecom allocation spectrum case probe.
Sinha, a 1979 batch IPS officer of the Bihar cadre, was the special director in the CBI.
The appointments committee of the Cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, cleared the name of Sinha who was among the candidates shortlisted by the committee earlier on Tuesday evening.
Sinha's term will be for two years from the date he takes charge, an official notification said.
Earlier on Tuesday, Modi held discussions with the Chief Justice of India and the leader of the main Opposition party in the Lok Sabha to select a CBI head.
The panel discussed the names of more than 40 officers shortlisted by the department of personnel and training, sources said.
Ranjit Sinha retired on Tuesday after a tumultuous tenure of two years at the helm of affairs in the CBI.
Sinha's tenure as the CBI chief saw highs like the busting of some bribery cases involving a railways board member, the chairman and managing director of a public sector bank and the chief executive officer of censor board.
The lows were mainly the criticism he faced from the Supreme Court that asked him to withdraw from the 2G probe; criticism from a court for shoddy probe in coal scam cases; sharing of status report in the coal case with the then law minister Ashwani Kumar, after which the agency earned the name of "caged parrot" from the apex court.

NHTSA Investigates Graco Over Child Car Seat Recall
This cancer patient wrote his own obituary. Civilians will recognize him best as Spider-Man  it reads.By Sarah Larimer December 1 Follow @slarimer
Before he died, Aaron Purmort sat down with his wife, Nora. Together — she later wrote on her blog — they penned ­Purmort's obituary.
"Purmort, Aaron Joseph age 35, died peacefully at home on November 25 after complications from a radioactive spider bite that led to years of crime-fighting and a years long battle with a nefarious criminal named Cancer, who has plagued our society for far too long," reads the obituary , which ran in the Star Tribune on Sunday. "Civilians will recognize him best as Spider-Man, and thank him for his many years of service protecting our city."
Here's what else it notes: Purmort's "long, entertaining stories." A high school band. A college degree. A job with Colle + McVoy, a Minneapolis agency . A son, Ralph, who will "will grow up to avenge his father's untimely death."
"I've never laughed and cried more in one sitting," Nora wrote on her blog, My Husband's Tumor , "but I’m so glad we got to do this."
I'm not sure if an obituary can be charming (I guess that's the right word for this?); but then again, it's your obituary, it can be whatever you want it to be, I suppose. And ­Purmort's is funny and warm, creative and bright. It even mentions Gwen Stefani. Apparently it made his wife laugh, at least, and how many obituaries can do that?
“There is so much beauty if you can face the hard part of life, " Nora told the Star Tribune . "And I learned that from Aaron."
You can now read about the Spider-Man obituary on Slate and Jezebel and Mashable and … well, it's gone viral, so a bunch of places , really, including the Daily Mail , which spoke with Nora.
According to the Daily Mail:
Nora said: 'Living with cancer is no battle -- you show up and hope you don't die is the battle.
'What sets Aaron apart is not just the obituary but literally the entire way he lived his life. He had this unbridled joy about him.
'We spent so much time in hospital, where mostly other people are in terrible moods and feel sorry for themselves, and Aaron didn't feel spend one second of his entire 35 years on earth feeling sorry for himself.
'When we were writing this we were laughing so hard, we had to take some parts out. ... We had so much fun these past three years.
'A lot of the stuff we went through was pretty terrible but it didn't feel as bad as it looked'.
Nora and Aaron Purmort have publicly discussed their story before. They were featured on the local news before their wedding , then again in the Star Tribune after a police officer's act of kindness .
And Nora Purmort has for some time been documenting her husband's illness on her blog, including this post , which details his first seizure.
"My mother is excellent in times of tragedy," she wrote. "She doesn’t believe in hysteria, and as my body warms up and I start to breathe a little heavier she stops me short of choking on my own sobs as we pull up in front of the dark doors of the Emergency Room.
" 'Go in there and be a woman,' she says. And even though I’m not sure quite how to do that, I open the car door and go."

Infosys plunges nearly 3% after going ex-bonusBSE
(At the NSE, it was down…)
MUMBAI: Shares of Infosys fell by nearly 3 per cent in intraday trade as the stock price factored in the issuance of bonus shares tomorrow to existing investors.
The stock of the IT major fell as much as 2.72 per cent to Rs 2,116 on the BSE today.
It ended the day at Rs 2,127.95; 2.18 percent, on the BSE.
At the NSE, it was down over 2 per cent to Rs 2,115. Marketmen said that profit-booking pulled down the stock as the company went ex-bonus.
The bonus issue was announced in October, when Infosys reported its second quarter numbers. It had recommended a bonus issue of one equity share for every share held.
Infosys had informed stock exchanges last month that the company has fixed record date as December 3, 2014 for the purpose of allotment of bonus shares/stock dividend.
The issuing company fixes a particular date which is termed as record date when the investor must own shares in order to be eligible to participate in events like receiving dividend, bonus shares.
Bonus shares are free shares given to the existing shareholders of a company.

Police investigating death of man whose body was found after protests in Ferguson last weekBy Wesley Lowery December 2 Follow @WesleyLowery
A protester stands in front of police vehicles with his hands up during a demonstration in Ferguson, Mo., on Nov. 24. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)
The man was 20-year-old Deandre Joshua . His body — found the morning after a grand jury declined to indict Darren Wilson — had been burned.
But did his death have any connection to the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown or the unrest that followed in this St. Louis suburb?
The timing and brutal nature of Joshua’s death — his partially burned body was found with a bullet in the head — spurred speculation that it might be connected to protests that occurred after St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch’s announcement of the grand jury’s decision on Nov. 24. On Internet message boards, some suggested that Joshua was a grand jury witness and wondered whether his death was in retaliation.
After all, just up the street, more than 60 shell casings were found in the parking lot of a BBQ restaurant. Around the corner, someone spray-painted the phrase “snitches get stitches” on the side of a building.
According to family members, friends and law-enforcement officials, however, Joshua was nowhere near Canfield Drive when Brown was killed during a confrontation with Wilson on Aug. 9 and couldn’t have witnessed the shooting. And McCulloch’s office — which remained tight-lipped about the Wilson investigation — this week confirmed that Joshua didn’t offer testimony during the proceedings.
“He was not a witness,” said Ed Magee, a spokesman for the county prosecutor.
Joshua grew up not far from Ferguson, one of four children in his family. He had an identical twin and a job at a local Walmart. He had recently started dating a woman who lived near where his body was found.
“He loved being with family,” said Diamonique James, Joshua’s cousin, who saw him Nov. 23 in Ferguson. “He was the life of the party.”
Family members told the New York Times that Joshua had considered joining the military or applying to community college but had decided to stick with his gig at Walmart, working the night shift. Joshua was also a close friend of Dorian Johnson, who was with Brown on the day of the shooting.
“It’s tragic. He was a good kid,” Johnson said on MSNBC after his death . “It’s a tragedy what happened to him.”
His relationship with Johnson, some close to his family noted, underscore how off-base the rumors about Joshua were. What are the chances that Johnson’s childhood friend, who didn’t live nearby, would happen to be on that street on that day? And if he was, why didn’t Johnson say anything to his attorneys or investigators about it?
“Dorian has known this guy since kindergarten,” said Adolphus Pruitt, a local NAACP president who helped Johnson locate witnesses after the Brown shooting. “If this guy had been around and saw anything, Dorian would have told us.”
Some have floated theories about Joshua’s death that aren’t connected to the Brown shooting. (The investigation remains active and ongoing.) Perhaps it was a robbery attempt gone awry, or a set-up. After the body was discovered, one Ferguson resident told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that he had spotted four armed men the night prior discussing killing someone.
“I knew it was going to be true,” Richard Taylor told the local paper last week. “When I got up this morning, I saw this.”

Treasury secretary: Obama is open to short-term tax deal with House GOPBy Lori Montgomery December 2 Follow @loriamontgomery
(Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)
Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said Tuesday that President Obama is willing to consider a House GOP proposal to extend an array of special interest tax breaks for just a few weeks, calling the measure preferable to a much larger deal under negotiation last week that would have left out White House priorities for poor and working families.
In a meeting with House Democrats, Lew "underscored the Administration’s strong preference for a tax extender agreement that both addresses the needs of working families and is fiscally responsible," Treasury officials said in a written statement. Lew "indicated the Administration is open to supporting shorter-term alternatives."
Facing a year-end deadline to extend the tax breaks, the statement appears to resolve a dispute that divided Republicans and Democrats but also moderates and liberals within the Democratic Party. Senate Democratic leaders said they too are open to approving the House GOP bill, which would revive the perks only through the end of December.
The provisions, which expired one year ago, benefit commuters, residents of states without income taxes, NASCAR track owners, Puerto Rican rum-makers, wind energy producers and corporations of all sizes.
Last week, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) was talking to Republican leaders about a larger measure that would have made some provisions permanent and extended the others through next year. But the talks blew up after Obama threatened to veto the emerging deal because it did not include the low income tax credit.

(The companies announced…)
DETROIT: Automakers that sell cars equipped with air bags made by Takata Corp. are teaming up to investigate why the bag's inflators can explode with too much force and spew shrapnel into the passenger compartment.
The companies announced the plan Tuesday and said they want to supplement tests that are under way now at Takata, the Japanese supplier at the center of a growing recall crisis.
So far 10 automakers have recalled 14 million vehicles worldwide due to problems with the air bag inflators, including 8 million in the US The recalls started a decade or so ago, and Takata has given various explanations for why the inflators can malfunction.
In a statement, Toyota said it will seek industrywide coordination to hire an independent engineering company, and all the affected companies would share in the results to figure out recall repairs. Other automakers, including Honda and Ford, agreed to cooperate.
The announcement came as Takata edged closer to a midnight deadline to agree to a national recall of driver's side air bag or face civil fines and legal action from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration . The agency said Tuesday afternoon that it has yet to receive a response.
A nationwide recall would cover millions of additional vehicles. Some of the biggest recalls so far have been limited to high-humidity areas in the Southern US, plus Hawaii and some territories. NHTSA has said that prolonged exposure to airborne moisture can cause the inflator propellant to burn faster than designed. That can rupture metal inflator canisters. At least five deaths worldwide have been blamed on the problem.
Takata issued a statement Tuesday saying it had formed a panel to investigate its process for manufacturing inflators, but it didn't specify whether it would agree to the national recall.
The industry's plan also comes a day before a US House subcommittee hearing concerning the air bags.

The federal government spent $3.1 trillion in the states in the 2013 fiscal yearBy Niraj Chokshi December 2 Follow @NirajC
(Credit: Ieva Geneviciene.)
The federal government spent more than $3 trillion in the states during the 2013 fiscal year, according to a new report.
That estimate, along with state-by-state spending breakdowns, comes from new Pew Charitable Trusts research — an attempt at filling a hole left by a discontinued federal report. The latest Pew research is the result of more than a year’s worth of work by one researcher, but it’s not the only such effort. Two months ago, we covered  the attempt by Pew and another think tank — the National Priorities Project — to replicate that lost federal report:
The Consolidated Federal Funds Report that both are seeking to replace was created in 1982 and was largely an aggregated product, a roundup of data produced across several federal agencies. It covered retirement and disability payments, direct payments, grants, procurement contracts, salaries and wages, direct loans, and insurance. It was imperfect, as the data came from different sources using different methods, but it offered a bird’s-eye view of federal spending on the states, researchers say.
The loss of the report was barely noted in the press at the time, though The Economist lamented its loss in a blog post, wryly noting  that “it seems the federal government does not have enough money to find out where its money is spent.” It was crucial to the work of a small set of researchers, academics and journalists, offering a broad view of how federal money is transferred to states.
Like NPP’s October attempt, Pew’s report seeks to replicate and replace the methods used by the Census Bureau. Pew breaks down federal spending into five categories: retirement benefit payments; non-retirement benefit payments; grants; contracts; and salaries and wages.
Per capita federal aid is lowest in Utah
(CORRECTION: An earlier version of this post incorrectly states estimates for per-capita federal aid by the National Priorities Project. It has been updated.)
The two analyses come to similar conclusions in looking at per-capita federal spending. Virginia is the state that receives the most per-capita federal aid, according to both analyses. Pew estimates that number to be $16,710 per person, while NPP pegs it at $17,069. Utah received the least federal aid per capita—$7,108, according to Pew, and $7,239, according to NPP.
Federal spending in the states grew 26 percent over the decade
Between the 2004 and 2013 fiscal years, federal spending rose 26 percent, with all categories except grants posting increases, according to Pew.

Federal spending accounted for about a fifth of state economic activity
Pew found that federal spending in the states in the 2013 fiscal year accounted for about 19 percent of state economic activity overall. Its economic share was largest in Mississippi, where it accounted for about a third of activity — 32.9 percent — and smallest in Wyoming, where it accounted for 11.6 percent of economic activity. (In D.C., it accounted for 42.3 percent of activity.)

The mix of federal spending is different in each state
States not only vary in the share of economic activity accounted for by federal spending, but also in the mix of federal spending received. Here’s one example from Pew:
For instance, in both Louisiana and Alaska, total federal spending was equivalent to about 18 percent of state GDP in fiscal 2013, just below the national average. But spending on salaries and wages was equivalent to 4.4 percent of Alaska’s economic activity compared with 1.4 percent  of Louisiana’s.

Most federal spending went out as benefit payments
The majority of federal spending in states came in the form of benefits payments to individuals, according to Pew. A full third — 34 percent, or just over $1 trillion — went out in retirement benefit payments. Non-retirement benefits accounted for 27 percent of spending. Grants accounted for 16 percent, while contracts accounted for 13 percent. A tenth of the money spent went to pay salaries and wages.

Fiery Niranjans Rajouri Garden event wasnt in BJPs planAWritten by Pragya Kaushika | New Delhi |
Posted: December 3, 2014 2:41 am | Updated: December 4, 2014 8:10 am
When BJP president Amit Shah asked MPs to pitch in for Delhi poll campaigning, the criterion was that the majority population in the area should be from the state to which the MP belongs.
But when Union Minister Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, a first-time MP from Fatehpur in Uttar Pradesh, was sent to West Delhi’s Khayala, which falls under Rajouri Garden Assembly constituency — a Sikh majority area, this was not the case.
Niranjan Jyoti was sent there because many in the party believed that she is a “good and fiery orator”. In addition, the lack of a Sikh leader who can spear head campaigning in a Sikh-dominated area, prompted party leaders to use Niranjan Jyoti on the first day of the MP campaigning programme.
“The MLA of that area, Manjinder Singh Sirsa, said he would bring Akali leaders for campaigning, but he could not secure time from them. After that, we tried to get one of our own Sikh leaders, but he too was unavailable for campaigning. The idea then was to enlist fiery leaders for Day One of campaigning in the capital. This was how Niranjan Jyoti was shortlisted,”a senior party leader said.
However, making Giriraj Singh campaign in Dhirpur ward, which falls in Adarsh Nagar constituency, met the criterion set by the party for allocation of campaigning areas. While he too was listed in  the “good orator” category, Giriraj Singh, who is an MP from Bihar, campaigned in Adarsh Nagar where many Purvanchalis reside.
“We have Azadpur Mndi and Wazirpur Industrial Area, where a majority of the labourers belong to Bihar and UP. There are other areas like Trinagar and JJ clusters of Wazirpur and Shakurpur, where a large number of Purvanchalis reside. Having Giriraj Singh with us boosted the party’s relations with them,” a party leader  said.
The leader said the idea of MPs from other states campaigning in Delhi came after many felt that voters from a particular state would be delighted to meet an MP of that state. “Voters would always say that my state MP had come and met me and this would establish a bond with migrants in the city,” he said.
Minister should not have used that language: Sirsa
Manjinder Singh Sirsa, MLA from Rajouri Garden, who was present at the event where Union Minister Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti made the controversial comment, said in an urban city like Delhi such language should not have been used. Sirsa, who shared the stage with Niranjan Jyoti, said, “This kind of language is not acceptable to anyone and that is the reason why even she apologised. The matter ends with the apology. That means she too feels that what she said was not appropriate.” - ENS

Back home in UP  she throws her weight aroundtooWritten by Lalmani Verma | Lucknow |
Posted: December 3, 2014 2:40 am | Updated: December 4, 2014 8:56 am
At the centre of a storm over her ‘Ramzaadon-versus-haramzaadon’ remarks, Union Minister of State Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti has been throwing her weight around in home state Uttar Pradesh ever since her election to Lok Sabha. She has had run-ins with officials over alleged denial of protocol and her supporters have sent complaints to the PMO and Chief Minister.
READ: Opposition ups the ante, asks PM Modi to sack Sadhvi Jyoti for her controversial remark
On November 24, a week before her highly offensive remarks at a BJP meeting in Delhi, Jyoti showed up at the Kanpur Central railway station at 7.30 pm, on way to her ashram in Moosa Nagar, Kanpur Dehat. When she realised that no police officer or district official was waiting to receive her at the station, she lost her temper.
Local BJP leaders said Jyoti contacted the district police and asked for security cover. A Maruti Gypsy with two policemen was sent to the party office. But by then, she had already set out for her ashram in a BJP vehicle, party leaders said.

Kanpur Mahanagar president Surendra Maithani said: “We sent a complaint to the Prime Minister’s Office and Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh on protocol not being accorded to an Union Minister. I have also written to BJP national president Amit Shah and state president Laxmikant Bajpai, informing them that the minister was not provided the desired protocol.” Maithani said he is yet to receive a response to the complaint.
In the last week of October, Jyoti landed at the office of the District Magistrate in Mathura. She wanted to hand a memorandum seeking compensation for villagers. Mathura BJP leaders claimed that she sought an 11 am appointment to meet DM Rajesh Kumar but reached his office at 12.30 pm. By then, the DM had left for a meeting. The BJP leaders claimed Jyoti’s staff contacted the DM but he did not return to meet her. BJP youth wing workers even staged a demonstration, claiming protocol had been denied to the MP.
When The Indian Express sought his comments on Tuesday, DM Rajesh Kumar said the MP had reached his office at 12.35 pm without seeking any appointment. He said he was attending a monthly meeting related to security at the Krishna Janmabhoomi.
“I got a call from my staff that the MP had come to my office to meet me. I said I will reach there within 15 minutes after the meeting. I sent the ADM to her but she refused to speak to him and left without giving any memorandum,” he said.
When Jyoti visited Mathura, she was not a minister, only the continued…

Abki Baar  Hamara Adhikar: Rally remindsGovtBy: Express News Service | New Delhi |
Posted: December 3, 2014 2:40 am | Updated: December 3, 2014 3:48 pm
“This government is trying to snatch away our rights, of both employment and land. We have come all the way to fight such injustice. Several people in my village voted for this government hoping they would improve our lives but they are doing just the opposite,” said Lal Singh from Rajsamand district in Rajasthan.
At a time when the NDA government’s proposals to bring changes to some key legislation like the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) and the new Land Acquisition Act have come under criticism from various quarters, including economists, more than 15,000 protesters from across the country held a rally at Jantar Mantar on Tuesday to protest against such changes. Lal Singh, an MGNREGA beneficiary and activist, was among those present at the venue.
Gathered under the banner “Abki Baar, Hamara Adhikar”, the rally saw social activists Aruna Roy, Medha Patkar, and Nikhil Dey in the lead. The activists alleged that the way the new government had decided to “attack progressive Acts” meant for the common people was an indicator that the government was pushing a “clear pro-corporate agenda”.
“This (rally) has brought us back to the fore of the political discourse. There cannot be an India without us or without our issues. A legislation is not passed by a government, it is passed by Parliament. A new government cannot change what Parliament has passed,” said Roy, former member of the National Advisory Council headed by Congress president Sonia Gandhi.
“With this we hope to create a strong people’s political force that will reach out to the government and to the corporate sector,” Patkar said.
Voices of protest against the alleged dilution of MGNREGA were perhaps the loudest. Reena Pandey, part of a pro-MGNREGA movement in UP’s Sitapur — one of the worst performing states under the Act — said it was important to retain the Act in its fundamental form while correcting shortcomings in its implementation. “There were problems with the Act but that does not mean one can restrict it. We need such a guaranteed scheme, especially for women who are the biggest beneficiaries. While there were problems even earlier, now they have become more acute — planning and availability of works is a huge problem and delays in wage payments have gone up,” she said.
Fears of possible adverse changes in the Right to Education Act brought many together. The RTE Act, 2011 introduced by the UPA government, was tweaked by Gujarat in 2012, when Narendra Modi was the CM. The rules framed by the Gujarat government granted some relaxations to schools in terms of infrastructure or teacher-student ratio.
Delhi-based RTE activist Shashi Kaur said, “The present (central) government has done nothing to ensure implementation of the RTE. There are schools without toilets or water. continued…

Nitish targets Modi on governance growthPosted: December 3, 2014 2:37 am | Updated: December 3, 2014 11:04 am
BY: GARGI VERMA
Former Bihar chief minister and erstwhile NDA ally Nitish Kumar Tuesday targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Union government, questioning why there was not a single Member of Parliament from minority communities among the BJP’s 282 elected members. Kumar also questioned the BJP’s development plank and emphasised that good governance was always inclusive.
“How is it that no member of India’s minorities, not even one from the largest minority, found a place in the tally of 282 BJP members elected to the Lok Sabha? Even in the BJP governed states, there are only 22 Muslims out of 1,359 MLAs. Likewise at the ministerial level, out of 151 Cabinet and Ministers of State in these nine BJP ruled states, just one belongs to the Muslim community. This surely is not a growth-for-all model, and thus can’t be held as an example of good governance,” said Kumar.
Kumar was delivering the 35th Bhim Sen Sachar memorial lecture held at the India International Centre.
Kumar emphasised that “good governance is a mix of transparency, justice, growth-for-all and communal harmony”. Targeting the Modi government on all of the above mentioned points, he said any government in India needs to follow the freedom fighters’ ideals for the uniform development of the country. Without naming any organisation, he added, “Of course, we can’t expect an organisation that didn’t even get involved in the freedom struggle to know and follow those ideals.”

Painful neighbours to labour pains  womens helpline is allearsWritten by Mayura Janwalkar | New Delhi |
Posted: December 3, 2014 2:36 am
A hacked tree, an unleashed dog, parking tiffs and home renovation woes — Delhi’s distressed women call the Delhi Commission for Women on its helplines for troubles of all sorts.
While the commission or DCW and its counsellors are trained to offer support to women facing serious crimes such as rape, sexual harassment, abduction and domestic violence, they have been patient even with those reporting other problems, sometimes trivial.
“They call DCW because they feel that they will be heard. A woman called saying that her neighbour had unleashed his dog on her. Another called to say that someone was dumping garbage in front of her house. What action can the DCW take in such cases? But we never turn them down. We either refer them to the appropriate authority or try to resolve their problems,” Barkha Singh Shukla, chairperson of DCW, said.
Between April 2013 and March 2014, the commission received 2,111 complaints. Of these, 106 were categorised under “harassment by neighbour”. In the same period, the commission also received 152 miscellaneous complaints, of which, it settled 59.
“A man called saying that his wife was going into labour and needed to be taken to hospital. He should have ideally called an ambulance but we tried to help him. We politely told him to take his wife to the same hospital where he had taken her for her first delivery,” a helpline coordinator said.
A DCW official said, “A woman called and said a man was dumping garbage outside her house. If the complaint was solely that it would not come under our purview. But she told us that when she scolded the man, he verbally abused her. So we had to step in.”
The DCW runs four helplines — general, rape crisis cell, pre-marital counselling cell and a mobile helpline.
Although they offer help to women facing harassment, several helpline operators said they had been harassed by “abusive callers”. “Some callers use such filthy language that it hurts our ears. Some people get drunk at night and make obscene calls. We complain to police and hand over their numbers,” a helpline coordinator said.
However, not all late-night callers are abusive, officials said. “A medical student, who used to study at night, once called the helpline number just to chat. He said he had no one else to talk to during the night. But he didn’t have a complaint either,” the coordinator said.

You decide your boundary  I will decide mine: Mamata toShahBy: Express News Service | Kolkata |
Posted: December 3, 2014 2:35 am
Returning the salvo fired at Trinamool by BJP leaders, including party chief Amit Shah, where the West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was accused of shielding the guilty in the Saradha scam and allegedly using the Saradha money in the October 2 Burdwan blast during a rally here Sunday, TMC chief Mamata accused the saffron party of indulging in lies against TMC as it is the main Opposition party in Parliament.
While addressing a workers’ meeting in Siliguri Tuesday, Mamata said, “TMC is under attack because it is the only thorn on BJP’s way now. It can’t be swept under the carpet just like that. It will continue to play the role of Opposition. This is precisely why they have got down to such heinous acts of launching personal attacks and character assassination.”
Without making any direct reference to Prime Minister Narendra Modi or Shah, she said: “May God pardon them for indulging in such lies and spreading canards. You can not say anything just because you have a microphone before you. There is a limit to everything. There is a boundary to geography, a boundary to politics, a boundary to Teesta, a boundary to the sky and even to the air,” she said. “You decide your boundary and I decide mine.”
Further, she said: “Delhi has been sold, the country has been sold. The railway, the retail market, the defence sector, has been sold. Why will the TMC be a party to these crimes? No one had agreed to share Valmiki’s sins. We will not do, either. People are simply being cheated. Transparency has been a casualty.”
Mamata also slammed the Centre for stopping the payment of the state’s share of the 11 days’ work programme despite knowing that Bengal is reeling under debts worth Rs 5,500 crores. “It is an attempt to starve the poor. The TMC will not accept it lying down. Like the past few days, the party will organise dharnas in Delhi for food soon,” she said.

Biogen Idec (BIIB) shares jumped nearly 7% Tuesday on news the company’s experimental Alzheimer’s disease treatment shows promise.
The biotech company’s research chief on Tuesday said it plans to conduct further testing on the Alzheimer’s treatment after seeing success in early testing at reducing mind-destroying brain plaque.
Shares of Biogen Idec gained $20.19, or 6.6%, to $328.63. Investors reacted to Biogen’s Douglas Williams’ comments at Deutsche Bank’s BioFEST conference.
Alzheimer’s is a disease that seriously damages the brain’s ability to recall memories, forming a form of dementia. There are other treatments in testing or at different points of development, but few have proven to be very promising.

Ranjit Sinhas deputy Anil Kumar Sinha is new CBIchiefBy: Express News Service | New Delhi |

Anil Kumar Sinha, a Bihar-cadre 1979-batch IPS officer posted as CBI Special Director, was appointed CBI Director on Tuesday, after a panel comprising Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Justice of India H L Dattu and leader of the single largest opposition party in the Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge met in the evening at 7 Race Course Road.
Anil Sinha, who was serving as second-in-command in the CBI, will take over from Ranjit Sinha, another Bihar-cadre officer who retired on Tuesday.

He served as Additional Director General of Police, Law & Order, and later as Additional DG heading the Vigilance Investigation Bureau in Bihar. He was involved in investigating a number of sensitive cases, including a large number of disproportionate assets cases against public servants. Sinha has also served as DIG and IG in the SPG.
A post-graduate in Psychology and M.Phil in Strategic Studies, he received the Police Medal for Meritorious Service in 2000 and the President’s Police Medal for Distinguished Service in 2006.

Gold dips as dollar strengthens and oil returns lowerGold dips as dollar strengthens and oil returns lower

(Gold prices consolidated…)
NEW YORK/LONDON: Gold slipped on Tuesday as a strong dollar and signals the US economy is benefiting from a decline in oil prices renewed expectations of a tightening in monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve around the middle of next year.
Spot gold dipped 0.95 per cent to $1,198.77 an ounce by 2:52 p.m. EST (1952 GMT), having gained nearly 4 per cent on Monday in its biggest one-day jump since September 2013. US gold futures fell 1.5 per cent to settle at $1,199.40 an ounce.
Gold prices consolidated after the spot market fell on Monday to a near-three-week low after Switzerland voted against boosting its gold reserves, then rallied to $1,220.99, its highest in a month, as oil prices recovered.
"Technically, it is important that gold holds the $1,190 area, as a breach through that level could generate further losses to that $1,140 to $1,150 range that we have seen on Monday," ActivTrades senior analyst Carlo Alberto de Casa said.
Bullion has fallen in tandem with oil in recent sessions on expectations that weaker crude prices could reduce inflationary pressures. The metal is usually seen as a hedge against oil-led inflation.
The dollar was up 0.8 per cent against a basket of leading currencies at the highest since 2010, underpinned by comments from Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer and New York Fed President William Dudley at separate events on Monday.
"If the economy continues to strengthen, you'll see the chances for that rate hike sooner rather than later and higher interest rates are always bad for gold because gold is a non-interest bearing vehicle," Phillip Streible, senior commodities broker for RJO Futures.
BofA Merrill Lynch analyst Michael Widmer noted trading is extremely choppy.
"Concerns over the impact of lower prices on inflation and what lower inflation does to a central bank's policy are driving factors," Widmer said.
Physical demand from Asian buyers supports gold, but prices in top consumer China were trading at a premium of less than $1 an ounce on Tuesday.
Platinum lost 2.1 per cent to $1,211.25 an ounce, while silver was flat at $16.42 an ounce and palladium edged 0.6 per cent lower to $798.50 an ounce.

Are book clubs the wave of the future at work2
"I've worked with managers in the past to assign them a book that we think will help them learn the things they need to learn or develop a skill they're not being exposed to," Eubanks said. "People who are successful are often crazy about reading. They make time for that because they understand how important it is, and it's kind of like a secret weapon."
A growing nonprofit program called Books@Work is finding that the books workers read don't have to just be about the workplace. Wading into literature can go a long way toward expanding minds and bringing colleagues closer together.
The Cleveland-based program — now operating in five states — finds professors from nearby colleges and universities to lead workplace literature seminars. Workers who participate will read a book or a series of short stories each month and, as a group, meet weekly with the professor. Ideally, this will continue for up to six months, with different professors handling different books.
"We have really had fun taking this program to different places, and so far we haven't found a sector that it doesn't work in," said Ann Kowal Smith, the program's founder and executive director. "What we've learned is that we're affecting people, affecting the companies and having an impact on society as these employees bring home the books and talk about them with their children and families."
Smith said the Books@Work program was implemented with administrators at a company that had been through a series of mergers and acquisitions. The merging of different work cultures and management styles had caused some problems.
The administrators read the book "Snow Falling on Cedars" by David Guterson, which deals with the looming post-World War II distrust between white residents and the Japanese-American community.
"That book enabled them to have conversations about what it's like to be the 'us' and the 'them' in a merger," Smith said. "The conversations were richer as a result of that."
So even if the book is fiction, the subject matter can lead to discussions about the workplace and examinations of how themes in the novels or short stories relate to a company, its people or its culture.
"When you open people up to fiction and poetry and short stories, you open up the aperture to what issues they can talk about," Smith said. "The book is an entree for people to realize that their life experiences are, in and of themselves, a form of expertise. They can tackle issues together and build on each other's ideas. Literature opens up conversations so much more than a management book does."
That doesn't mean it's bad or ineffective to encourage workers to read management books that tie in with the skills and ideals a company is trying to foster. But by looking beyond just business books, you might foster unexpected connections or create a deeper understanding among different people.
If you want to learn more about Smith's program, go to booksatwork.org .
And if you want to try introducing literature into the workplace on your own, Smith has three pieces of advice:
•Pick a piece of literature that is "respectful, opening and inviting to perspective." There are a number of examples of books used in the Books@Work seminars on the program's website.
•If you can't find a professor willing to help, make sure you have someone there to facilitate the discussions, ideally a person who's "eager to learn from the group."
•Off the bat, discourage people from talking about whether they liked or disliked the book. "I think that's a fairly destructive conversation," Smith said. "Sometimes we learn the most from the books we really wrestle with." Get people to focus instead on characters or on the plot.
One of the nicest aspects of encouraging reading in the workplace is there's no right or wrong path. You can experiment and see where people find value.
The worst that happens is you learn something. And I'm told that learning is good. Maybe even better than watching television.

Agent s closing gift to buyer won t violate real estate law0
In plain English, you cannot give anything of value for a promise to provide you with a client or business. For example, recently the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reached a settlement with a Michigan title company that entered into agreements with companies as quid pro quos for the referral of settlement business. The company agreed to pay a $200,000 penalty and to cease their practice
In your case, you are going to give a gift, with no strings attached. It is nothing more than a thank you for being a client. I would consider giving a prepaid gift card from a local company. It's a nice gesture, but it also is a way to build client relationships. Your client will remember you and will most likely refer other clients to you.
Q: My mother recently passed away. Because my dad's sole income to care for the home is fixed, I helped him pay off his mortgage with my insurance policy money received for my mother's death. My gift was a little more than $17,000. Can I claim that gift on my taxes?
Also, I learned my parents had a $22,000 equity line of credit that my father cannot afford to pay off. If I take the money from my 401(k) to pay off the loan to save the family homestead, is there any tax penalty that can be offset by a tax break holding a mortgage with my father if he pays me for doing this?
A: The first question is easy. For gifts made in 2014, there are no tax consequences if the gift is not over $14,000. Since you have gifted $17,000, you will have to file a gift tax return (IRS Form 709) for the $3,000 excess. Talk to your tax adviser about this.
The second question is more complicated. Although there are some exceptions, if you withdraw money from a retirement account before you reach 59 1/2, you will be subject not only to ordinary income on the amount of the withdrawal, but also a 10 percent additional tax. Some of the exceptions include: a rollover to another qualified plan no later than 60 days after the withdrawal or distributions on death or disability. There are also some hardship exceptions, but they apply to the taxpayer's hardship; in your case, the hardship is on your dad.
Why don't you consider buying the house from your dad for market value, less about 6 percent because you don't have to pay any real estate commission. Your dad will take back a mortgage, and you will be paying him monthly (or quarterly) based on an acceptable mortgage interest rate. Presumably, since he has owned and lived in the house for at least three years, he will be able to exclude up to $250,000 of any gain. If he sells it to you within two years from the date your mother died, he should be able to exclude up to $500,000 of the gain.
As for the home equity loan, since it appears to be a small amount, talk to the lender about letting you assume that loan. However, they may want to be in first trust position, which means that your dad's mortgage will have to be in second place.
It's a little confusing, so please discuss all these issues with your legal and financial advisers.

This Ocean  Documentary  Will Change How You See  GTAreddit
"Grand Theft Auto V" has become synonymous with portrayals of intense violence and graphic sex , but a team of YouTube filmmakers put it to a more peaceful purpose -- creating a fake ocean documentary using the game's engine.
The three-man group known as 8-BIT BASTARD started by creating video game comedy videos, but the new video , released last Saturday, is closer to an homage: The group says it was inspired by the nature documentaries of Sir David Attenborough , a documentarian known for his enthusiastic, up-close stories about animal life.
"I've had a big interest in marine biology for quite a few number of years now, and have always been a big admirer of Sir David Attenborough, and I've always wanted to create some what of a spoof of one of his documentaries," Alec Chaney, one of the 8-BIT BASTARD filmmakers and the main one behind this project, told The Huffington Post via email.
The new "documentary" shows a blue whale encountered in "Grand Theft Auto V."
Titled "Into the Deep," the faux documentary showcases underwater life in the "Grand Theft Auto V" world viewed from the game's submarine vehicle. Players can take a break from the story, access the submarine, and dive into the world's ocean. The first-person view included in a recent re-release of the game on Playstation 4 and Xbox One helped make the video possible, Chaney said, as did the addition of new marine life.
"I was very lucky to have captured the footage that I did," Chaney said. "There have been some speculations as to how I captured some of the animals I came across on my journey -- I just want to say that everything I filmed was all natural, I didn't manipulate any of the animals in any way."
As for why "machinima," or videos created using computer graphics like those seen in video games, is compelling as a medium, 8-BIT BASTARD member Craig Evans said it has an appeal similar to song covers.
"There's something oddly captivating about creating or recreating something in a digital world and drawing parallels to a real-life equivalent," Evans said. "For those unfamiliar or ill at ease with the concept, I always equate our video parodies and recreations to covers of songs. If they can accept that an artist can adapt and cover a song, they can start to get their head around the attraction of recreating something visual in a digital realm."

Deflation looms as Europe's economic bugbear
AP Dec 3, 2014, 12.30AM IST
Tags:
(Deflation, which is generally…)
LONDON: It's the D-word that's pushing the European Central Bank into a corner.
But it's not debt Europe's main economic problem in recent years that is driving speculation the ECB will switch on the printing press to help the economy.
It's deflation.
At first glance, deflation, which is generally defined as a sustained drop in prices, sounds good getting goods cheaper surely warms the heart of any consumer.
The problem lies when prices fall consistently over time, as opposed to temporary declines, which can give economic activity a boost. The recent sharp fall in the oil price, for example, is expected to help growth.
Longer-term deflation encourages people to put off spending and can prove difficult to reverse because it requires altering people's expectations. It can lead to years of economic stagnation, as in Japan over the past two decades, or at worst, into something more pernicious, such as the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The determination to avoid another Great Depression was largely behind the US Federal Reserve's activist response to the financial crisis of 2008 and the ensuing recession.
Former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke spent much of his academic career studying deflation and in a major speech in 2002 before taking the helm he laid out a strategy to counter deflation should it rear its head again. Much of his prescription was put into action during the financial crisis slashing interest rates to near zero, injecting new money into the economy through a program of government bond purchases. The ECB has long held off the last bit the large-scale bond-buying but as the risk of deflation grows in the 18-country eurozone, it is finally considering it.
"Sustained deflation can be highly destructive to a modern economy and should be strongly resisted," Bernanke said in his speech. "Prevention of deflation is preferable to cure."
  Deflation in Action
Deflation has been a rarity in modern economic times compared with high inflation, in which the price of goods spirals higher. However, both can cause economic havoc.
A consistent drop in prices chokes an economy mainly by enticing consumers to delay big purchases beyond everyday needs such as food and energy in the knowledge that they will cost less down the line. Keeping money under your mattress suddenly becomes an appealing investment strategy.
And faced with lower prices, businesses also make less profit and start looking to reduce costs. That means job losses, wage cuts and a growing reluctance to invest and innovate. The economy is weighed down further, prompting businesses to cut costs further, exacerbating the deflationary spiral.
Deflation can also worsen public debt and that's not what Europe needs. Though the nominal amount of debt remains the same, it in effect grows because prices are lower.
Europe on the Deflation Edge
Unlike the Fed and many other major central banks, the ECB has held off massive bond-buying to fight deflation, not least because it is technically more difficult across a bloc of countries.
However, ECB President Mario Draghi has hinted recently that the bank is ready to launch such a program, called quantitative easing, if needed to get inflation back toward target.
The eurozone is not witnessing deflation at the moment though several member countries, notably Greece, are seeing sustained price falls. At 0.3 per cent in the year to November, consumer price inflation in the eurozone is perilously low and way below the ECB's target of just under 2 per cent.
In effect, a central bank creates new money when doing quantitative easing. By buying the bonds, it can keep a lid on longer term interest rates and the value of the currency, helping exporters. And financial institutions, awash with cash after selling their bonds, can lend the money on to households and businesses. All in all, the hope is such a program stokes activity and gets rid of the deflation.
In Germany, the idea is met with caution.
As well as conjuring up images of the 1920s hyperinflation, there are more immediate concerns bond-buying could lead to German taxpayers being lumbered with the debts of countries like Greece, Italy and Portugal. A belief in sound finances is as German as Bavarian beer.
"What Germans are worried about right now is the cancellation of southern European debt," said Albrecht Ritschl, a professor of economic history at the London School of Economics.
  Deflation Stickiness
What historical bouts of deflation do show from the US experience in the 1930s to Hong Kong after the Asia crisis of 1997 is that, once embedded, it can be awfully difficult to get rid of.
Cue Bernanke's warning that preventing deflation is better than curing.
In theory, the best option available to a central bank to deal with deflation is to cut interest rates to stimulate demand and stoke inflation. Lower borrowing costs can boost consumption and help increase demand for credit.
But when interest rates are already at rock-bottom levels, as they are currently in the eurozone, other methods have to be pursued. And that is where bond-buying comes into play. Its effectiveness, however, is a matter of debate.
Proponents say it helped in the US and Britain, where growth has rebounded. Not so in Japan, the country that can best testify to deflation's stickiness. Two decades on from when deflation took root following a stock and real estate collapse, Japan is still trying to rid itself of deflation.
Over the past couple of years, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has launched Japan's most sustained effort to combat deflation. So-called "Abenomics" involves huge amounts of stimulus from the Bank of Japan, heavy government spending and wide-ranging economic reforms.
The jury is out on whether it will work Japan fell back into recession in the third quarter.

Lia Sophia going out of businessJewelry company Lia Sophia going out of business
Chicago Tribune

Direct-sales jewelry company Lia Sophia to close by end of February
Lia Sophia, a direct-sales jewelry business that enlisted thousands of women as independent sales reps in the tradition of Avon and Tupperware, is going out of business after 28 years, the Wood Dale-based company has announced.
Creative director Elena Kiam wrote in a blog post on liasophia.com Monday that "given the challenging business environment, we made the painful decision to wind down Lia Sophia in the United States and Canada by December 31, and cease operations by the end of February."

Kiam and her husband, Tory Kiam, the company's CEO, were not immediately available to comment.
The couple took over the fashion jewelry business from Tory Kiam's father, Victor Kiam, onetime owner of the New England Patriots and president of Remington Products. Victor Kiam was famous in the 1980s for featuring himself in Remington commercials in which he said he liked the shavers so much, he bought the company.
Victor Kiam bought direct-sales jewelry company Act II in 1986 and renamed it Lady Remington. His son renamed it Lia Sophia, after the names of two of his daughters, in 2004.
This company is a complete joke. They wont even honor the orders that were placed before their big announcement. My rep can't give me an honest answer and she owes me cash! This is a joke of a company

A 2008 Chicago Tribune story said Lia Sophia had 27,000 independent sales representatives nationwide who collectively sold more than $100 million worth of costume jewelry a year.
According to the Lia Sophia website, entry-level "advisers," who take home 30 percent of their sales, on average made $7,420 annually in 2012. Earnings rose as they climbed the ranks, to an average of $357,872 annual income for a "zone leader."
Sales representatives took to the company's Facebook page Monday to express surprise about the announcement, gratitude to the business and frustration about recently ordered starter kits that would go unused. They also decried the "vultures" from other direct-sales companies that swarmed the page to recruit Lia Sophia reps.
The company is selling thousands of pieces of jewelry at up to 50 percent off when purchased through its representatives through December.
Dawn Grelyak, of Schaumburg, who has been selling Lia Sophia jewelry for six years, said she was surprised to learn that the company is shuttering just as she is closing out on her best sales year. Grelyak, who said she is one of about 800 Lia Sophia sales representatives in Illinois, said they were told the news during a conference call Monday morning.
Grelyak, 45, said she signed on with the company because she was a stay-at-home mom accustomed to working and needed to get out of the house. But as it became more lucrative, her family came to depend on the additional income for "fun money."
"It has been a wonderful company to work for, and it has been generous all the way to the end," said Grelyak, a team leader with 12 women on her team. She expects to continue direct jewelry sales with another company.
"I had my first recruiting call within two hours" of the announcement, she said.

The Gender Employment Gap Is Alive and Well  Thank Youreddit
In a country that seems almost embarrassingly desperate to prove that it is making headway in regards to women's wage equality and employment opportunities, there is nothing particularly incendiary or groundbreaking in the statement that this is not the case. And, perhaps, that is a quite sugary-sweet way to phrase it. While the media often self-consciously reminds us that we have women in power positions at such behemoths as YouTube, PepsiCo and H-P, these assertions and namedrops seem touted more to distract us from reality than provide truthful accounts of the situation. These women, quite bluntly, are diamonds in the rough . In fact, the statement that women still make only 78 cents for every male dollar is not far off. As Jenna Goudreau so un-ironically put it back in 2012: "It's been a standout year for women in business. For the first time in history, there are now 20 female CEOs at the 500 biggest U.S. corporations." Wow. Go us.
These statistics have more subtle, real-world implications as well. In my experience in the male-dominated world of entertainment, the situation is heart-rending. Take, for example, the summer smash hit Guardians of The Galaxy. The writer, Nicole Perlman, is the first female to ever have a writing credit on a Marvel movie. E-ver. And I'd task you to find ten people outside of the industry who know her name. What "might have been a watershed moment for female filmmakers hoping to be taken seriously in a wildly popular movie genre that is often considered reserved for men " was instead barely a footnote. When I attended AFI's Female Directing Workshop showcase earlier this year, in order to support a talented friend of mine who had been accepted into the program, Kim Peirce put the situation quite eloquently , speaking of the question that was posed to her repeatedly on her press tours. "Why did it take so long to make a second movie? I feel that I can safely say that none of the women directors in this room would probably ever ask that about another woman director. We all know why. Less than 6% of the top 250 films and only 14% of television episodes in 2013 were directed by women."
And anyone who tries to fight their way around the realities of this gender-income gap is kidding themselves. How about the article in the Daily Beast, in which Christina Hoff Sommers tries to explain-away the situation by pointing out the fact that women are perhaps choosing more superfluous careers . "Women, far more than men, appear to be drawn to jobs in the caring professions; and men are more likely to turn up in people-free zones." As if that is something to hang a bonnet on. And, it just so happens, is completely untrue.
So what about males and females with exactly the same college degrees and majors, pursuing exactly the same career path? Of all of the promotions that I have seen since my graduation in 2010, I can state definitively that majority of them have been my male friends. Of two friends who started at the same company in 2010, one male and one female, my male friend has already been promoted twice, as well as garnered some widespread industry acclaim for his work. My female friend, by contrast, is just as capable and talented, and yet has not enjoyed the same benefits and accolades. She is a hard worker and damn good at what she does, and has been that way since high school. Recently, three male friends of mine were all promoted simultaneously, while two of my female roommates in the same industry have yet to move up in rank. We even had a party to celebrate their simultaneous good fortune. While these men are similarly talented, these instances seem too curious to be coincidental.
Two-to-twelve? Not too shabby.
Now, you could say that these are just the growing pains of fledgling careers. That we will all catch up in the end. But it gets bigger.
Way bigger.
One of the best gifts I've been given in my life was the good fortune to grow up the daughter of a strong-willed, working mother. When I was four years old, and she was pregnant with my second brother and her third child, she was elected First Selectman in my hometown of Simsbury, Connecticut. My childhood quickly became a whirl of endless parades, ribbon cuttings, and those exciting fall campaigns during election time. I felt a part of the town.  The residents were good to us. And so, in turn, was my mother to them. During her sixteen years as First Selectman (there are no term limits, so long as you have enough overwhelming support to win an election every two years) she has helped put Simsbury on the map. In 2013, Money Magazine voted Simsbury as one of the best places to live in the country .
This morning, my mother was forced to resign when Republican members of the Town Committee voted to cut her pay by 35% in the middle of her term . Thirty-five percent, for a woman who had served the town in head office for sixteen years, helping change the very fabric of it with the establishment of the Connecticut Greenway and bike share program, as well as a Summer Concert Series, which brought in the likes of Allison Krauss and Harry Connick Jr. She had even been tapped by current governor Dannel Malloy to run by his side for lieutenant governor in 2006, and again by businessman Ned Lamont in 2010. This woman's got talent, and everyone can see it.
In 2007, my mother was tapped as Chief of Staff for Lieutenant Governor Kevin Sullivan. During that time, Republican Tom Vincent was elected in her stead, and the same Republican committee voted to increase his salary. TWICE. When he first turned down a proposed 3.4% pay increase, the Republicans seemed intent on pushing it forward anyway , voting 3-2 to raise his salary by 13.4%. The salary was bumped up again by 3.5% the next year. Tom Vincent was only in his third term, while my mother had served over four without a pay raise of this caliber. Watching my mother, who had grown up fatherless and put herself through law school, work her way up to a highly-respected leader of a small town, is an ascent which has left a mark on me.
And this event, no doubt, will leave an even bigger one. For if what us women see at twenty-seven, with our male friends often enjoying faster career growth and larger salaries than us, is destined to continue through the peaks of our careers, how can we say that equality exists? When a male political figure can assume office and quickly enjoy the benefits of an inflated salary, yet that salary can be cut haphazardly by the same committee for a woman with a long-term commitment to a town, where is the precedent for protection and proper treatment of working women?

Endorses Campaign Finance Reform... Inadvertently.reddit
In the heat of the last two weeks -- Immigration, Ferguson -- we shouldn't miss that in its November 20th issue, The Wall Street Journal editorialized that the only reason Democratic senators blocked the Keystone Pipeline was that environmentalist billionaire Tom Steyer contributed to them.
Gee, I thought conservatives believed that campaign donations were no big deal:
"It looks as if Tom Steyer did get something for the $74 million he spent on the midterm elections. The billionaire environmentalist bought what is left of the Democratic Senate. That's the story behind the remarkable display Tuesday night in which 41 Democrats voted to abandon a Senate seat rather than cross Mr. Steyer and the big green money machine... The party of the private union working class is gone. Green money rules... With a few exceptions, the Democrats who will remain in the Senate next year are either gentry liberals themselves or are too afraid to risk losing the green cash on which they have become dependent. Either way, Tom Steyer owns them."
Hmmm... If Steyer is buying liberals, then what are the Koch Brothers, Sheldon Adelson, etc. getting from the Republicans? Votes and women? Given how shrewd they are at business, they must be getting something more than votes since their donations exceed Steyer's.
Given its support for the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, which enabled this spending spree, it appeared that "owning" Senators was actually OK with the Journal. (Unlike John McCain, who called it the Supreme Court's "worst decision ever." The Court then accepted McCain's challenge with an even worse decision in McCain's home state: American Free Enterprise Club vs. Bennett.  There the Court struck down a law which provided public funding to a candidate who is considerably outspent by his opponent.  This was said to violate the free speech of the big political money raiser!!!  Oh, I'm sorry...in the WSJ's campaign finance analysis:  the free speech of the big political "whore.")
So, WSJ, welcome to the fight to clean up our political system.  Ready to support campaign finance reform?
Or is it only OK when conservative officeholders are purchased?

Hey  Divorce Lawyers: You re About to Get Fired!reddit
If you're a divorce lawyer, chances are pretty high that you're an email away from getting dumped by your client.  The "Dear John" email is likely already written and saved in your client's draft folder.  She's waiting for the next time you blow her off or insult her to click send.  Odds are, she won't have to wait very long.
Getting canned will come as a total surprise to you.  You're actually doing good (or at least good-ish) work on her case.  So, why are you about to be fired?  Because your client doesn't like you.  And why would she?  You treat her like garbage.
You talk down to her. We all get it.  You have a fancy law degree and tons of experience handling divorces, and your client has neither.  But that doesn't give you a license to treat her like dirt for not knowing all the important stuff that you know.  The fact that you have skills and qualifications that she lacks is exactly why she ponied up that hefty retainer and hired you to begin with.  If she had your credentials and knowledge, she wouldn't need you at all.  You're the store and she's the customer.  If you want her to keep buying what you're selling, act like you value her business and make her feel like she's come to the right place.
Here's an exercise that will give you insight into how to treat her: Put your massive ego to one side for a minute and walk a mile in her shoes.  Imagine that you're going through the scariest time of your entire life and that everything that matters to you hangs in the balance.  Next, imagine that you've hired a super-duper expensive person to pilot you through the terrifying and confusing legal process that you have no choice but to go through.  Then, the next time you communicate with your client, treat her the way you'd want to be treated if you were in that exact same position.
You don't keep your word. I realize that from your standpoint most of her questions don't seem very pressing or important.  In fact, some of them are silly and annoying.  So, what's the big deal if you promised that you'd call today with answers to her pesky questions, but you don't actually get around to calling until tomorrow?  You're fighting a million fires and you have to prioritize.
The problem is this:  She doesn't know her question is no big deal.  If she did, she wouldn't have asked it.  She also doesn't know that the reason you didn't call her is that you were so busy with other, bigger fires that you honestly could not come up for air.  And she sure as heck doesn't know that you plan to call her as soon as you get out of that hearing tomorrow afternoon.  You know why she doesn't know any of these things?  Because you never bothered to tell her.  All she knows is you didn't call like you said you would, and it's anybody's guess when she'll hear from you again.  And she's left to wonder what else about her case you're ignoring.
She's not the only one who doesn't know stuff. There are things you don't know, too.  And some of those things are important, like the fact that tomorrow afternoon is a terrible time to call because she'll be driving carpool, and she really can't talk about Daddy draining the bank account and taking that hooker to Hawaii when she has a minivan stuffed full of kids.  So try your best to keep your word.  And for the times you can't, at least give her a head's up rather than simply blowing her off.
You make her list of worries longer. When she doesn't know what's going on with you, that actually adds more items to the already long list of things she loses sleep over.  In addition to tossing and turning over her life being turned upside down, she now has to worry about whether you're lazy, or unorganized, or forgetful, or too busy, or disinterested, or undependable, or unethical. She has to questions if her trust in you was misplaced.  She second-guesses whether she's picked the right lawyer.  She wonders if it's too late to fire you and hire someone else.
Her impression of how things are going with the legal end of her divorce is based on the updates you give her; and her impression of you is based on how you treat her when you're giving her those updates.  Even if you're doing everything else right, if you botch these two things, your client's confidence in you will be seriously undermined.  And it will be your fault, not hers.
You drop stuff on her at the last minute.  You know that statement you told her to whip up over the weekend and email to you by Monday so you can have it for mediation?  You've known for weeks that you were going to need that from her.  You could have let her know about the assignment and its due date a long time ago.  But you didn't.  Why?  Because in your view, it's a no big deal project.  It doesn't take a law degree to write it.  There's no research or careful drafting required.  You routinely have to pull together projects that are a hundred times more complicated in a fraction of the time, and you don't come unglued.
What you don't get is this: The projects you drop on her without even thinking are actually much harder than anything that you have to routinely do for you job.  You know why?  Because to her, they're not routine.  This is not her job; it's her personal life.  Surprise divorce assignments at a time like this can completely derail her.  If she has her kids, the assignment will cause her to be too preoccupied and stressed out to fully be with them.  If she doesn't have her kids, she'll be too busy obsessing over the daunting last-minute assignment to relax.  Either way, you've detonated a bomb that's totally ruined her weekend.  And she's paying big money for that treatment.
You berate her if she misses a deadline. From her perspective, deadlines don't seem to mean much to you.  You blow off calling her when you say you will.  Court dates and various deadlines routinely get moved around -- often without checking with her, and sometimes even without telling her until the very last minute.  But if she fails to get you something when you ask for it -- like discovery responses, for example -- you treat her like a she's a complete screw up.  You drone on and on about how her irresponsible behavior is jeopardizing the outcome of her case.
You can't have it both ways.  If you want her to respect deadlines, then you need to act like you respect them, too.  Keep the deadlines you make for yourself; notify her when something has to be changed; and give her the courtesy of explaining why.
You treat her like she's both crazy and boring.  Anyone who has ever worked with divorce clients knows that they are a not-so-charming combination of crazy and boring.  They're crazy because divorce causes people to lose their minds.  And they're boring because they all seem to lose their minds in exactly the same way. Crying jags. Screaming tirades.  Public meltdowns.  Ten page long emails to you at 2:00 a.m. Twenty page long emails to their ex at 4:00 a.m.  You haven't just seen it all; you've seen it all a million times.
But here's the deal: This may be the millionth time for you, but it's not the millionth time for your client. This isn't just another divorce. This is her divorce.  So if you can't be sympathetic and supportive while you charge her however many hundreds of dollars an hour to represent her, then it's time for you to find another job -- and preferably one that doesn't require you to be both a decent human being and a competent lawyer.  I hear lobbying firms might be looking for your type.  Your client may even be willing to write you a recommendation letter -- but don't drop that request on her at the last minute.  She's got a lot on her mind right now.

Bangladesh bullish on energy ties with IndiaBangladesh bullish on energy ties with India
Pratim Ranjan Bose
Hopes to meet half its demand in 10 yrs from India, Nepal, Bhutan
Kolkata, December 2:  
With the Saarc Framework Agreement for Energy Cooperation (Electricity) in place, Bangladesh is gearing up to meet half its projected 10,000 MW incremental demand in the next 10 years from India, Nepal and Bhutan.
According to Taufiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, energy advisor to Bangladeshi Prime Minister Seikh Hasina, Dhaka is bullish on enhancing the scope of energy cooperation with Delhi.
While India has granted in-principle approval to Bangladesh’s request to enhance (thermal) electricity sales from 500 MW to 1,100 MW (mostly through open market purchase), discussions are also on to collaborate in harnessing renewable energy sources.
‘Power in North East’
According to the arrangement for hydro-electricity development, harnessing hydro resources in the North-Eastern States (many of which share a border with Bangladesh) will be crucial to this initiative.
India currently taps a mere 2 per cent of the nearly 69,000 MW hydro-power potential in the North-East.
Dubbed as “Power in Northeast”, the joint initiative aims to develop hydro-electric projects (in India) to meet the energy needs of both nations.
“The discussions have been on between the Governments for some time. Now, it is possible to develop the projects,” said Chowdhury.
India has in place a collaborative agreement with Bhutan that has attracted huge investments from Delhi in developing a number of large hydro-electric projects and earning money on sale of excess power to India.
Chowdhury says creation of a common market should help India create a demand for solar power. Competition from cheap coal-based power is a major hurdle to the wider use of solar energy in India (and China). Considering that Bangladesh is run on costlier gas-based electricity, it has a greater appetite for solar energy.
The market potential, he argues, is particularly high due to vast time difference between solar power hubs of Rajasthan and Gujarat in Western India and Bangladesh on the Eastern border.
Though India has one time zone for the entire country; the sun sets in Rajasthan a clear two hours behind Bangladesh, opening up an opportunity for solar power companies in India to meet a part of the peak evening shortage in Dhaka.
Bangladesh joins TAPI
Meanwhile, the Saarc agreement has finalised Bangladesh’s entry into a consortium for the Trans-Afghanistan gas pipeline project, referred to as the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) project. “Bangladesh first expressed its interest to join the TAPI project nearly two years ago. The energy cooperation deal made Bangladesh’s entry a certainty,” Chowdhury said. He wants to rechristen the project TAPI-B.

Says central bank not responsible for higher borrowing costs in the market
Mumbai, December 2:  
Corporate India, which has been clamouring for a rate cut, may have been disappointed with the RBI but Governor Raghuram Rajan had a strong message: don’t take a short-term view. Terming corporate India’s belief that the RBI is not concerned about growth as a “misconception,” Rajan said corporates should instead manage their risk profiles better.
“I think it is very short-sighted when people comment that you are not helping growth this quarter. We are not talking about quarters, we are talking about years of sustainable growth.
In order to get that, you have to fight inflation, beat it and then you can get the sustainable growth. I think that is a message that needs to seep through,” Rajan said.
Industry demands
After the latest provisional reading suggested that growth moderated to 5.3 per cent in the July-September quarter, from 5.7 in the preceding quarter, the rate-cut chorus among industry participants grew louder. Industry body CII (Confederation of Indian Industry) even expressed disappointment after the RBI status quo on policy rates.
In a written statement, it said, “CII feels that at this juncture, even a symbolic cut in policy rates would have sent a strong signal down the line that both the Government and the RBI are acting in concert to harness demand and take the economy to the higher orbit of growth.
“Industry was particularly hopeful of a rate cut… A rate cut would have propelled investment demand, spurred spending in rate sensitive consumer durables and given a fillip to construction activity.” Rajan said that corporate India should not blame the RBI because of the higher borrowing costs in the market.
“The immense risk premium that is being demanded of some corporates is because of the state of their leverage, the risks they have taken and their unwillingness or their inability to repay should not be attributed to the RBI,” Rajan added.
He added that by bringing down expectations of inflation, the bond yields have come down by 60-70 basis points since July.
“That is a fall in borrowing rates. Short-term rates have come down. These are the positives for corporate India,” he pointed out.

Mitch McConnell: We cant repeal Obamacare  but Supreme Court may take it down insteadBy Greg Sargent December 2 Follow @theplumlinegs
The current legal challenge that could gut Obamacare subsidies in three dozen states is regularly described by its proponents as an effort to enforce the law as written. As Dave Weigel has noted , from time to time, champions of the lawsuit acknowledge their real goal is to destroy the law by any means necessary, a frank admission of the goals of this particular exercise in right wing legal activism.
But now this link between the lawsuit and the goal of taking down the law has been drawn tightly by none other than the incoming GOP Senate Majority Leader.
In a very candid moment, Mitch McConnell flatly describes this legal challenge as a substitute means through which an end — repeal — will be accomplished that Republicans failed to accomplish through the political and legislative process.
The moment, which was flagged by a Democrat, comes in an interview that McConnell gave to the Wall Street Journal’s Gerald Seib this morning (see second video). Seib notes that some Republicans have advocated for repeal, and asks: “How do you approach the Affordable Care Act now?” McConnell answers (emphasis added):
“It bears the president’s name. The chances of his signing a full repeal are pretty limited. There are parts of it that are extremely toxic with the American people. The elimination of the 40 hour work week. The individual mandate. The medical device tax. The health insurance tax. I think you could anticipate those kinds of things being voted on in the Senate. Such votes have not been allowed in the past.
“Who may ultimately take it down is the Supreme Court of the United States. I mean there’s a very significant case that will be decided before June on the question of whether the language of the law means what the language of the law says, which is that subsidies are only available for states that set up state exchanges. Many states have not. If that were to be the case, I would assume that you could have a mulligan here, a major do-over of the whole thing — that opportunity presented to us by the Supreme Court, as opposed to actually getting the president to sign a full repeal, which is not likely to happen.”
McConnell suggests the new GOP-controlled Senate will vote to repeal parts of the law, but acknowledges legislative repeal is unlikely to succeed, before stating that there is now a real possibility that instead, the Supreme Court will “take it down,” giving “us” the opportunity of a “mulligan” and a “major do-over of the whole thing.” Even if McConnell is simply describing this as the objective outcome that will result from a SCOTUS decision against the law, it represents a noteworthy level of candor.
On the legal argument, McConnell says the “language of the law” unambiguously “says” that “subsidies are only available for states that set up state exchanges.” That claim — that the key phrase “established by the state” means Congress did not extend subsidies to people in the three dozen states on the federal exchange — has already been widely challenged by legal observers. They note that even a purely textual interpretation of the whole law — putting the contested phrase in its broader statutory context — upholds the government’s interpretation of the disputed phrase, and not that of the challengers.
Some, such as Brian Beutler , have argued that read in context, the key phrase unambiguously supports the reading that Congress intended the law to make subsidies available to people in all states. Others have argued that even if the phrase’s meaning in context is merely ambiguous, the court should side with the government.
In this context, McConnell’s new quote takes on particular interest. As law professor Nicholas Bagley notes in his response to the challengers’ claim , even if you grant that the challengers’ reading of the phrase is reasonable, the government’s reading of it in context can also be reasonable. Which presents the court with a challenge, as Bagley notes:
Even if you think [the challengers'] claim is plausible, maybe even attractive, the contrary interpretation offered by the government is at least reasonable. That brings me to the scope of their argument that troubles me the most: their unyielding conviction that they’ve identified the only possible construction of the ACA. Nowhere do they acknowledge that maybe, just maybe, they’re wrong.
That’s because they can’t admit to doubt. Because of the deference extended to agency interpretation, doubt means they lose. But their unwillingness even to acknowledge ambiguity reflects an important difference between legal advocacy and neutral interpretation. To be clear, [the challengers] deserve immense credit for their lawyerly ingenuity: they’ve constructed a facially plausible argument in support of an exceedingly strange interpretation of the ACA. But the courts would violate their obligation of fidelity in statutory construction if they mistook that ingenuity for genuine obeisance to Congressional will. The latest challenge to the ACA is political activism masquerading as statutory restraint.
Asked for comment on McConnell’s latest, Bagley told me:
“McConnell confirms here that the litigation is politics by other means. It sounds like McConnell is treating the Supreme Court as another political institution.”

Portman opts for Senate  Paul for defying his states election rulesBy Jennifer Rubin December 2 Follow @JRubinBlogger
In the pre-presidential primary jostling, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) announced he will run for reelection, not the presidency. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) announced he will run for reelection but has already made clear he will not be deterred by Kentucky state law, which bars him from also appearing on the ballot for president. As we have pointed out , Paul’s poll numbers have been slowly sinking. In the last CNN poll he is at 8 percent without Mitt Romney in the field, 6 percent with Romney in the race; about a year ago he was at 15 percent. Keeping his Senate seat is a smart move, then.
The contrast between these two is striking.
Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, center, speaks with reporters in May.  (AP Photo)
Portman is the sort of politician who should be president — experienced in the House, Senate and executive branch, squeaky-clean, mainstream conservative and serious on both domestic and foreign policy. But you have to run for the White House to get there, and Portman did not see that as an enticing prospect. “I don’t think I can run for president and be an effective senator at the same time. While I appreciate the encouragement I have received from many to run for president, my focus will remain on Ohio and running for re-election to the Senate in 2016,” he said in a statement. “With the new Republican majority, I see a real opportunity over the next two years to break the gridlock in Washington and actually get things done to help Ohioans and all Americans.” He might be right about the latter, although it might be more like “a real opportunity to show what Republicans could get done when President Obama is not there.”
Portman is a thoughtful person with expertise in the public and private sector and particular skill on budget matters, as a former head of the Office of Management and Budget, and on trade, as a former trade representative. In an interview this fall with Right Turn, he sketched out plans for a number of initiatives including a robust domestic energy plan.
Paul, who has a total of four years in elected office and not a single legislative achievement to put his name to but dozens and dozens of cable TV news appearances, proclaimed, “I ran for office because, like many Kentuckians, I was alarmed at the problems facing our country: a stagnant and uneven economy, a growing national debt, out-of-control federal spending, a disastrous health care plan, the assault on our civil rights and liberties, and a misguided foreign policy. I have drawn attention to these problems and others here in Kentucky, like the War on Coal, an overzealous EPA and Army Corps of Engineers, and the ban on industrial hemp. I have sought to work with any and all who are eager to find solutions and promote reforms. I stand with Kentucky in this fight, and I hope to continue together in the task of repairing and revitalizing our great nation.” Well, maybe with Kentucky only if the presidential thing doesn’t work out.
Now in fairness to Paul, he probably can run for office and keep doing what he is doing in the Senate, since he is not one to immerse himself in detailed negotiations or draftsmanship nor to master the details of ongoing legislation. He surely can run for president and parachute in for an impassioned floor speech now and then or send an op-ed over the transom.
Right now the potential GOP presidential candidates more like Portman (with experience and a record of executive leadership) are sprinkled at the top (Jeb Bush, Chris Christie) and the bottom (Bobby Jindal, Scott Walker, Mike Pence) of the very early national polls. The question for voters is whether they will want to pick a man or woman of substance and proven temperament or take a flier on their own Obama, a lightly credentialed ideologue. I’m betting it is the former, but one or more of those guys has to run to be president.

Backup Peters stays positive after tough outing vs. TorontoBy Alex Prewitt December 2 Follow @alex_prewitt
(AP Photo/Canadian Press, Darren Calabrese)
Justin Peters sat down on the Washington Capitals ’ bench Saturday night in Toronto, baseball cap atop his head, and tried to navigate the tricky task of balancing anger with encouragement. He had allowed two goals during the first period. One deflected off a stick, then a thigh, then into the net. Another deflected off a stick and zoomed through his legs. In the locker room, Coach Barry Trotz told Peters he needed spark, so Braden Holtby would replace him after intermission.
“As soon as I was told I’m not going in, I have to go from being [ticked] off at myself to being a supporting cast for Braden, supporting cast for the team,” Peters said Tuesday. “If I’m going to sit there and pout about it, it’s not going to be a good vibe for the team, it’s not going to have any positive effect on anyone else, including myself.”
After Holtby allowed three goals during the second period and a 6-2 blowout kept chugging toward its inevitable conclusion , Peters returned and completed his shortest outing of the season. In seven games with the Capitals since signing for two years in free agency, Peters’ .872 save percentage ranks 63rd among 67 NHL goaltenders. He hasn’t allowed fewer than three goals over his past five appearances dating to Oct. 18.
But with 14 games in December ahead and only one back-to-back – Dec. 22 at home vs. Ottawa, Dec. 23 in New York against the Rangers – Peters might have several weeks to work out the kinks. Tuesday after Washington’s morning skate, while the scratched skaters worked with assistant Blaine Forsythe, Peters and goaltending coach Mitch Korn returned to basic fundamentals, slowing down the drills and working on simple things like sliding to block shots.
“For me, when you’re not in there every night, you’ve got to truly find a way to be sharp in practice,” Peters said. “I’ve been trying to treat the practices like my games. Get a good warmup before, really bearing down in practice and staying and helping, getting some extra work after.
“You’ve got to learn from what happened. The only way to take a positive from it is learning from it. There’s no point just trying to forget about it or trying to move on from it, pretending it didn’t happen. We’ve got to realize what went wrong, areas we can improve. That’s what I’m trying to do.”
Some of what went wrong, Peters said, was best forgetting. Morgan Rielly’s unassisted goal caromed off Evgeny Kuznetsov’s stick, then flicked off Nate Schmidt’s thigh and past Peters.
“That’s when it really tests you mentally to stick with the process,” Peters said. “Such an unfortunate bounce, in something like that you can only laugh really.”
The next goal, 23 seconds before the period ended, came because another stick deflected Cody Franson’s point shot on Toronto’s power play. But Peters let it slip through his five-hole. The Capitals had fallen behind 2-0, their largest first-intermission deficit since Oct. 14, coincidentally when Peters made his Washington debut because Trotz pulled Holtby less than 10 minutes after the puck dropped. Now, Trotz approached Peters in the visiting locker room and informed him Holtby would go in.
“He wanted to make a change to get the guys going, and I believe in his process and what he’s doing and I respect that,” Peters said. “Obviously I want to stay in there, I don’t want to come out of the game, but that’s his call.”
Now, with Holtby starting Tuesday against Vancouver and for the foreseeable future, Peters received some extra work with Korn. During Trotz’s years in Nashville, he had seen Korn use additional time to help Tomas Vokoun, Mike Dunham, Chris Mason and Carter Hutton become serviceable NHL netminders. He will hope for the same with Peters.
“It’s just fundamental things, it’s all those things you want,” Trotz said. “As long as you’re using the knowledge Mitch is providing, you’re going to improve.”
Sitting at his locker Tuesday, Peters thought back to Saturday, specifically those 20 minutes of limbo between when he got yanked and when he returned. He had experienced this situation before, as had Holtby, and understood the reasoning behind Trotz’s decision. After all, what more could he do besides watch, cheer and wait?
“If you sit there and you’re [mad] and cursing and swearing, feeling sorry for yourself, if you’re asked to go back in there and you’re not ready to go back in there,” Peters said. “Obviously you need to be disappointed. It’d be unhealthy if you’re not, but as soon as you can turn it into, ‘Okay, I need to help this team get going, get rah-rah, be supportive for Holts, for the guys,’ it allows you to get back in the right frame of mind to get back in there.”

Pakistan running special trains for terror mastermind Hafiz Saeed

Hafiz Saeed
(Pakistan government is…)
LAHORE: In a sign of official patronage to Mumbai attacks mastermind Hafiz Saeed-led JuD, Pakistan government is running two special trains to transport people to Lahore for the terror group's two-day congregation here.
The chief of Jamaat-ud-Dawah , a front for terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba , Saeed told reporters here on Tuesday that thousands of people would participate in the congregation starting on December 4 at the ground of Minar-i-Pakistan monument.
Pakistan Railways is operating the first train from today from Hyderabad, Sindh province, that will arrive in Lahore on Wednesday night.
Another train will leave from Karachi and arrive here on December 4. The two special trains will also take the people back to their hometowns on the conclusion of the congregation.
The JuD leadership had spoken to railways minister Saad Rafique for his permission to run special trains for its congregation, official sources told PTI.
Spokesman for the country's railways Rauf Tahir said there had been a "uniform policy" to run special trains on the request of political and religious parties.
"The railways has a uniform policy for everyone. Pay and hire a train. Two special trains will be run for JuD congregation but not free of cost," he said.
In a related development, Imran Khan's Pakistan Tahreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has also postponed its call to block Lahore on December 4 on the "request" of the JuD leadership.
"Yes we have changed Lahore's plan on the request of JuD. The JuD told us that thousands of people are coming to Lahore on December 4 and it cannot afford any hurdle in it," a senior PTI leader said on condition of anonymity.
Tightening its noose around Lashkar-e-Taiba, the US in June added its affiliates, including the JuD, to its list of designated terror organizations.
India has maintained that Saeed is the mastermind behind Mumbai terror attacks in 2008, conspiracy for which was hatched, planned and executed out of Pakistan. The attacks claimed 166 lives.

Church fire an attack on Christians  says Giriraj  a short distanceawayWritten by Aniruddha Ghosal | New Delhi |
Posted: December 3, 2014 2:54 am | Updated: December 3, 2014 2:21 pm
One of the BJP’s masters of controversy on Tuesday addressed a campaign rally in the neighbourhood where the burning of a church had left the city’s Christians distressed.
But there were words of reconciliation this time. Union Minister Giriraj Singh, who was speaking at a campaigning event, lamented the fire incident. He began addressing the rally by speaking about the fire. “What happened at the church was an attack… (“Church ke upar… ise hum humla hi kehte hain) . I criticise this. There is no space for any sort of mischief at places of worship,” he said.
On Monday, a portion of the St Sebastian Church in Dilshad Garden was destroyed after a fire broke out. Parish members have alleged that the fire was deliberately started with kerosene.

The minister from Bihar, who had made controversial statements on Monday, said he was secular and he believed in everybody’s freedom to practise their religion. “But I am anti-appeasement. The Congress government in the past years has, in the name of secularism, carried out their politics of appeasement. This is harmful for the country,” he said.
He alleged that his statements are consistently “misinterpreted by the media” and as a result he couldn’t take names. “Naam nahi lunga, bolenge rakshas se tulna kar di (I won’t take names, they’ll say I compared them with demons).”

On Monday, he had recalled a story from his village where he compared Arvind Kejriwal to Maarich (a mythical character who could disguise himself). “We used to have Ramlilas in our village. A youth once demanded that he be given a chance to play Hanuman’s role. He had no experience. And he ran away from the stage. Kejriwal wohi nakli Hanuman hai. Kejriwal un rakshasho mein bhi Maarich hai, jo vesh badalta hai par kabhi na kabhi pakda jata hai.”
At Seemapuri on Tuesday, he repeated the same story. But without mentioning Kejriwal by name or making any direct reference to Maarich. Instead, he said, “Kejriwal also ran away from the stage. He went back to sitting on dharnas with Anna Hazare.”

Clarify stand on IT laws or be ready for stay on them: SC togovtWritten by Utkarsh Anand | New Delhi |
Posted: December 3, 2014 3:48 am
The Supreme Court Tuesday gave an ultimatum to the Centre to either clarify its stand on Information Technology Act provisions that envisaged arrest for contentious posts on social media or be ready to have such laws stayed.
The court cautioned it would make such generic provisions inoperative if the government failed to file a comprehensive affidavit and explain its stand within a week.
“Heavens are not going to fall if the provisions are stayed. This matter cannot be treated lightly. Two years have passed and there is no definite answer from you (Centre)… either you file your affidavit or we will stay the operation of these provisions,” said a bench led by Justice J Chelameswar.
The bench gave the government a week’s time to file the affidavit into a bunch of petitions that have sought declaration as unconstitutional Sections 66A and 74 of the IT Act.
Section 66A provides for maximum three-year imprisonment for sending ‘offensive’ or ‘annoying’ messages through a computer or communication device while Section 74 provides for two-year jail term for intermediaries hosting such content.
Citing the cases where arrests had been made by police over Facebook posts or messages on other social media websites, the petitions have stated that the IT Act provisions empowering police to arrest at whims trampled upon freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. The court will hear the case next on December 9.

Slum residents move court against feareddemolitionBy: Express News Service | New Delhi |
Posted: December 3, 2014 3:47 am
A week after 400 jhuggis in south Delhi’s Rangpuri Pahadi were demolished, residents of two JJ clusters in the area have moved the Delhi High Court, fearing that their houses too would be demolished.
Residents of the JJ cluster at Rangpuri Pahadi nalla and a slum at the Dalit Ekta Camp in Vasant Kunj approached the court on Tuesday, alleging that the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and other agencies were threatening to demolish the JJ clusters without following proper procedures.
The residents, in their pleas, said they feared they too would be evicted like the residents of Rangpuri Pahadi and their hutments demolished.
The separate pleas were heard before two single Benches, which asked the government to respond on the issue of rehabilitation and resettlement of the slum residents. “You can’t throw them out on the road in this cold,” the court said.
The government told the court that the decision to demolish the illegal JJ colonies was taken on the basis of directions issued by the National Green Tribunal (NGT), which on November 11 directed the civic agencies to remove all encroachments from the Ridge and forest areas in Delhi to preserve the green cover.
The case, filed by the residents of the Dalit Ekta Camp was heard before the court of Justice V K Shali, who directed the DDA not to go ahead with Wednesday’s planned demolition.
The residents, represented by advocate Prashant Bhushan, claimed no survey or inspection had been carried out to determine how long the residents had been living there.
The court also took note of the argument that the JJ cluster was surrounded by DDA colonies C-6 and C-8, Vasant Kunj, and the institutional area nearby. “This is not forest area. It’s in the midst of a concrete jungle,” Bhushan said.
The court asked the residents and the DDA to submit the map of the area to determine whether the JJ cluster is in forest land.
The court also asked the government and the DDA to file copies of the orders issued by the appropriate authority for the demolition of the clusters. The case will be heard on Wednesday.
The case filed by the residents of the Rangpuri Pahadi nalla JJ colony was heard before the court of Justice Vibhu Bakhru, who too asked the government not to go ahead with the demolition. It will hear the matter further on Thursday.
Justice Bakhru, however, noted that since the NGT had issued clear directions, the demolitions will have to be carried out.

Centre went ahead with DBT for LPG subsidy after A-GnodWritten by Ruhi Tewari | New Delhi |
Posted: December 3, 2014 3:47 am
The NDA government’s decision to relaunch the Direct Benefits Transfer (DBT) scheme for LPG subsidy in mid-November, albeit in a modified form, came only after Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi gave his unequivocal go- ahead to it, even as Solicitor General Ranjit Kumar had said re-starting the scheme would be in “clear contempt” of the court.
The UPA government had suspended the Aadhaar-based DBT scheme after a Supreme Court order that the government could not make Aadhaar numbers mandatory for people to avail of the benefits of government services and subsidies, including subsidy for cooking gas.
However, the BJP-led government re-launched the scheme from November 15 this year in 54 districts, but provided an alternative by introducing the option of consumers availing of the subsidy and receiving it directly in their bank accounts, in case they didn’t have Aadhaar numbers, though the latter was kept as the primary option.
This decision came after Rohatgi, in his opinion dated November 11 — four days before the scheme was re-launched — said he was of the “clear view” that last year’s Supreme Court order does not bar the launching of the new scheme as proposed by the government “in view of the alternative provided”. The Attorney General said even though “primacy” was given to an Aadhaar card holder, no beneficiary would be deprived of the benefits even if he/she did not possess one. The opinion went on to say no clearance or permission was required from the Supreme Court before launching the modified scheme and added it could be launched on November 15 as decided by the government.
The Union Cabinet had cleared the scheme on October 18. Solicitor General Ranjit Kumar, however, had opined on September 11 that the DBT scheme, if started, will be in “clear contempt”. Kumar had noted that “any action to be taken for restarting the scheme should require the prior approval of the court”.
Government sources claim it is likely that the government did a rethink after the SG’s unfavourable opinion and subsequently introduced the alternative of beneficiaries receiving subsidy directly in bank accounts, if they don’t have Aadhaar numbers.

IIT-Kharagpur student gets Rs 1.5-crofferBy: Press Trust of India | Kolkata |
Posted: December 3, 2014 3:44 am
In one of the fattest pay packages offered to an IITian ever in campus placements, a student of IIT-Kharagpur has been offered a whopping annual salary of over Rs 1.5 crore.
IIT-Kharagpur officials said the salary package was among the 163 offers made by 27 visiting companies Monday on the first day of campus placements. The highest domestic package was of Rs 42 lakh and highest offer from abroad was of US$ 250,000 (Rs 1.54 crore), the officials said.
The IIT authorities have refused to disclose details about the student or the company which made the offer, saying “this brings unnecessary attention to the student”.
IIT sources claimed that the 1.54 crore offer is the highest ever package received by the Kharagpur unit and among the largest ever in all IITs.
The highest number of offers (24) was made by niche analytics consulting company EXL Service Pvt Ltd due to growth induced demand, followed by international brands like VISA, Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, Cisco, Microsoft IDC. Analytics, IT and Finance are leading so far. The first time visitors — Parthenon, TSMC , BMGI, VISA, Baker Hughes and Auctus Advisors — also gave an encouraging response.

Shadowy Islamic cult in Thane probefocusWritten by Praveen Swami | New Delhi |
Posted: December 3, 2014 3:42 am
The  National Investigation Agency (NIA) has begun questioning members of the shadowy Mumbai-based religious cult, Islamic Guidance Society, whose members are suspected to have funded and facilitated the travel of four men from the city’s suburbs to fight with the Islamic State (IS) in the Middle East.
The widening investigation comes days after the arrest of Thane student turned IS jihadist Areeb Majeed, who returned home with bullet injuries. NIA sources said the agency on Tuesday questioned IGS activists Anil Dolare, Atif Inamdar and Sufian Sheikh, the last a lecturer who taught Anjuman-i-Islam Kalsekar Technical Campus, where Areeb Majeed was a final-year engineering college student.
The NIA’s investigation seeks to determine how Majeed and the three men he travelled with to Iraq obtained the Rs 60,000 each of them paid for their tickets. Majeed, the sources said, has told investigators he saved Rs 25,000 for the trip over six months, but has said nothing on how the group raised the remaining money, which they paid in cash to local tour operator Shaheen Travels.
Majeed, along with Shaheem Tanki, Fahad Sheikh and Aman Tandel flew to Iraq on May 23 as part of a pilgrims’ group. The four men then caught a taxi to Mosul, travelling through Fallujah.
The IGS, which has an estimated membership of 50-60, has held regular meetings in and around Mumbai for the past two years. Police sources say the group preaches an end-of-times theology, urging members to embrace its neo-fundamentalist conception of Islamic orthodoxy in preparation for the coming apocalypse.
Its core tenets include the belief that the apocalypse will be heralded by the Ghazwa-e-Hind — a prophesied war on India by an Islamic army.
Early this year, investigators say, Majeed was introduced to the IGS by a friend, Mumbra resident Fayaz Khan. He allegedly lost interest in studies thereafter, and began spending hours watching speeches by neo-fundamentalist preachers. Following the rise of the IS, he became increasingly convinced that the end of time was nigh — and decided to fight on the side of the “Caliph’s army”.
From Majeed’s Facebook account, investigators have determined that his contact was made through an account operated by Tahira Bhat, a pseudonym for a still unknown individual. ‘Tahira Bhat’, whose now-defunct Facebook page claimed to offer access to the IS, provided Majeed with contact details for an “Abu Fatima” in Baghdad, would would lead them to the group.
In a statement to the Mumbai Police — which, under Indian law, is not admissible for the purposes of his trial — Majeed  said the group took a taxi to Mosul, and stayed at a mosque. There, an individual named “Ali” put them in contact with the IS.
The group, according to investigators, trained at a camp on the Euphrates, some 40 km from the IS capital of al-Raqqa. They were put through basic fitness drills, taught how to use small arms, and received basic instruction continued…

Intelligent parking system debuts at ConnaughtPlaceWritten by Shalini Narayan , Aditi Vatsa | New Delhi |
Posted: December 3, 2014 3:39 am
Taking a step closer to its plan to introduce online booking facilities for parking, the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), has installed variable message signs (VMS) at Baba Kharak Singh Marg and vacancy information boards in Connaught Place.
This was done recently in collaboration with Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS). The mobile application for online booking of parking lots will be launched in the coming weeks, officials said.
DIMTS officials said vacancy information boards have been installed near the entry gates of parking lots in Connaught Place. Each parking lot has at least one or two such boards displaying specific information about availability of lots for different kinds of vehicles. “The boards display information on how many two-wheelers and four-wheelers are already parked there and how many more slots are available,” the DIMTS spokesperson said.
The official said VMSes will also be installed at three sites and these will give out information on the overall parking space.
“One has been installed at Baba Kharak Singh Marg. The remaining two locations are yet to be decided on. The VMS will help drivers find their convenient place for parking, according to the information on hand,” the spokesperson said.
NDMC Director (Projects) O P Mishra said, “Currently, we are conducting an experiment in some NDMC areas to check the system. Depending on the feedback we get by February 15, the system will be replicated in other areas under our jurisdiction.”
The installation of these boards are part of the NDMC-DIMTS plan to make parking in the area hassle-free. “From providing WiFi in Connaught Place, installing these parking screens and providing online booking facility for parking in future — we are looking at an integrated parking scheme for NDMC area. The mobile application will show vacancies in parking lots. Tenders for the app have been invited and we have received three entries so far. Orders are going to be issued in the next few days,”Mishra said.
“Once the app is downloaded, those visiting CP can know in advance as to whether parking will be available by the time they get there. This will save fuel and, to some extent, prevent traffic jams. Also, the hand-held machines that have been installed at almost all parking sites, help keep track of the transactions in real time and send data to the control room. We have also developed back-end data management to track and monitor transactions,” the DIMTS spokesperson said.
Sources in DIMTS said the boom barrier-controlled automated parking system will come up at 20 sites. One site would be Block F in the Inner Circle of Connaught Place. Two sites in Janpath have already been completed and work is on at the rest of the sites.
The council has handed over around 94 parking lots in its area continued…

Udit Raj  BJPs Dalit face  gives mahasabha themissWritten by Pragya Kaushika | New Delhi |
Posted: December 3, 2014 3:31 am
In a major embarrassment for the Delhi BJP, its Dalit face and MP from Northwest on Tuesday gave a miss to the Akhil Bharatiya Dalit Mahasabha, which had BJP chief Amit Shah in attendance. It is understood the party leadership has taken note of his absence from the Dalit conference.
Meanwhile, Udit Raj is also planning to hold a ‘maha’ rally in the capital. When contacted and asked about his absence from the Dalit mahasabha that saw the presence of Prabhat Jha, BJP Delhi unit president Satish Upadhyay, Rajya Sabha MP from Rajasthan and former Delhi unit chief Vijay Goel besides Shah, Raj said, “I was not supposed to come and it is not necessary to attend all such events.”
The chairman of Valmiki Mahapanchayat More Singh, when asked whether he had invited Raj to the event, said, “Arey Raj is a big brother, unhe invite karne ki zaroorat thodi hai.”
The event did highlight the fissures among the Dalit leaders, party leaders said. “At an event which is attended by the BJP leadership, it is surprising that the lone Dalit face of the party is missing,” a senior leader said.
Upadhyay made two announcements that will also become part of the Delhi BJP manifesto — one, jobs for Dalits and, two, laptops for Dalit children.

Uber Suspends Operations In NevadaUber Suspends Operations In Nevada
Reuters
reddit
(Reuters) - Ridesharing company Uber suspended its operations in the U.S. state of Nevada late on Wednesday in a setback that it said would cost nearly 1,000 jobs.
Companies such as Uber allow passengers to summon cars using apps on their smartphones, rather than calling a taxi company, and have gained popularity in dozens of U.S. cities over the past few years.
But they face opposition from taxi companies and some officials who argue the upstarts do not face the same stringent regulations as do traditional cabs, and insurance companies want their drivers to carry more expensive insurance policies.
Uber's decision to temporarily suspend its service in Nevada came after a legal setback.
On Tuesday, a Washoe County District Court issued a preliminary injunction preventing the company from statewide operations, siding with Nevada over regulatory concerns in a case that was referred to the court by a split panel of the state's Supreme Court, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.
"It's unfortunate that Nevada is the first state in the nation to temporarily suspend Uber," spokeswoman Eva Behrend said in a statement, adding the shut-down would cost nearly 1,000 jobs.
"We remain committed to working with Nevada's leaders to create a permanent regulatory framework that affords Nevadans the flexibility and innovation offered by Uber," Behrend said.
Requests for comment were not immediately returned by Nevada's Attorney General's office.

Political debate obscures impact of immigrationAfghanistan ‘This is not over yet’
There are certainly signs that, as the global economy recovers unevenly from the effects of the 2008 global financial crisis and the economic malaise that followed, some migrants are seeking opportunities in those countries where the recovery is strongest. Britain last week reported that net migration reached a record 260,000 in the year to June 2014, a result derided by critics as a government failure and hailed by business groups as a needed tonic for a recovering economy.
But, viewed globally, the situation is neither as simple nor as new as the heat in the political debates might have you think. In fact, when you consider the data, migration today looks more like an odd paradox of globalisation than a consequence of it.
We live in a globalised world in which the opportunities for mobility are much greater than before. However, the reality is that we are just as prone to stay home as we were half a century or more ago. There are more migrants today than there have ever been – more than 232m, according to the UN. But then there are more people in the world than at any other time.
Today, as was the case in 1960 and as has largely been true for the five decades since, just 3 per cent of the global population live outside the country of their birth.
“Why is it that 97 per cent of the world population doesn’t migrate, at least internationally?” asks Mathias Czaika, a researcher at Oxford university’s International Migration Institute.
“The phenomenon is not migration. The phenomenon is non-migration.”
That, he argues, should be at the core of the political debate. But politics have always been volatile in economic downturns and history tells us that migrants have often been targets for the disgruntled when economies slow.
The reality is that migration in history tends to track economic opportunity and that this time is no different.
According to UN data, there are now a million less migrants in the world each year – 3.6m on average in recent years – than there were before the crisis. According to the OECD, the number of migrants seeking jobs in its predominantly rich member countries almost halved from 4.4 persons per thousand population in 2005-08 to 2.6 persons per thousand in 2009-2012.
Illegal migration, often driven by a search for economic opportunity, also appears to have slowed in recent years in the US and Europe. In the EU, illegal immigration has fallen largely as a result of the expansion of the union and the drawing in of countries such as Romania that had at one time been big sources of illegal migrants.
People continue to flee conflict: more than 3m people have registered as refugees from the war in Syria alone. But the great migrations today are taking place inside countries rather than across borders.
China has 200m more urban residents than it did a decade ago and plans to house 100m more migrants from rural areas in its cities by 2020. The world as a whole now has a little over 230m international migrants and added 77m between 1990 and 2013, according to UN data. There is a vast difference in rate also. China is urbanising at a rate of 1.8m new city residents each month, according to the World Bank. The US, which remains the biggest destination for immigrants, gains just over 1m new legal immigrants each year.
Spend some time looking at the data and it becomes clear that politicians may be having the wrong immigration debate.
Global movement: Steady flows
There are more people living outside their home country than ever, with the UN classifying 232m people as international migrants in 2013. But that is largely a result of population growth. Since 1960, the percentage of the global population classified as migrants has remained steady at roughly 3 per cent.
Arrivals and departures: American dream reigns while Indians and Bangladeshis lead exodus
The US remains by far the biggest destination for migrants. There are now almost 46m people in the US classified as international migrants, or one in six of the population. India and Bangladesh have been the biggest net exporters of people in recent years.
Crisis takes toll: Slowdown restricts movement
The crisis of 2008 had a big impact on migration, with a million fewer people a year moving to another country on average after 2010 than in the 10 years before, when the average was 4.6m, according to the UN. Average net migration between OECD countries fell to 2.6 persons per thousand in 2009-12, according to the OECD.
Traffic signals: US tightens border with Mexico
The US-Mexico border is the world’s biggest immigration corridor. But both legal and illegal immigration have slowed. In the 1990s, more than 500,000 migrants a year crossed into the US from Mexico. Since 2010, that number has fallen below 200,000 a year, according to UN data.
Levelling off: Downturn deters illegal workers
Illegal migration to the US has fallen in recent years – a phenomenon that some economists attribute to dwindling economic possibilities since the 2008 crisis. According to the Pew Research Center, the US’s population of illegal immigrants has stabilised just above 11m in recent years after peaking at 12.2m before the crisis.
Continental shift: EU anxieties drive churn
The crisis in the EU has caused significant churn in its migrant population. Those countries hit the hardest by the economic crisis, such as Greece and Spain, have seen significant net emigration in recent years. Countries that have done better economically, such as Germany and the UK, have attracted more migrants.
Blighty bound: UK recovery attracts EU citizens
The recovery in the UK economy has been drawing migrants back, with net migration to the UK reaching 260,000 in the year to June 2014. But the number of non-EU migrants coming to the UK has been declining, even as the number of people moving to the UK from other EU member states has been rising.
Educated and mobile: Skills are coveted
The battle is on to attract skilled migrants and it shows in the data. According to the OECD, the number of tertiary-educated migrants to its largely rich member countries has risen by 70 per cent in the past decade. Some 35m of the 115m migrants living in OECD member countries now have university degrees.
Cost concerns: Impact is broadly fiscally neutral
Opponents of rising migration say governments cannot afford the cost. Economists and business groups have long said the opposite is true: new arrivals do not just consume resources, they spend money and pay taxes. The OECD last year found that if there was a cost from new migrants it was generally small.

Nationals have decisions ahead of non-tender deadlineBy James Wagner December 2 Follow @jameswagnerwp
Ross Detwiler. (Thomas B. Shea/Getty Images)
The deadline to tender contracts to players eligible for arbitration comes Tuesday at 11:59 p.m. The Nationals entered the offseason with 11 players, potentially 12 with Bryce Harper’s dispute, eligible for arbitration. The Nationals already agreed to a deal with Kevin Frandsen last month and avoided arbitration. So the Nationals have to decide whether to tender contracts to only 10 arbitration-eligible players ahead of the deadline.
This large group of arbitration-eligible players have helped form the core of the Nationals during this recent run of division titles. They have become more expensive over the years — this current group of arbitration-eligible players is expected to command just under $50 million — but many are approaching free agency. Four of the 10 players could be free agents after the 2015 season, and that doesn’t include Ian Desmond and Jordan Zimmermann who both agreed to two-year deals last winter to cover their final two arbitration seasons.
The Nationals appear poised to tender contracts to all 10 players, but Ross Detwiler remains the biggest question mark. A quick rundown of the arbitration-eligible players, with the projected salaries according to MLBTradeRumors.com: (The actual salaries are determined in January.)
Final Year of Arbitration
SP Doug Fister ($11.4 million): A candidate for a long-term extension, along with Zimmermann and Desmond, but also for trade fodder, too. Even though he missed the first month of the season, he had a stellar season, his first in Washington, and was a rotation leader.
RP Tyler Clippard ($9.3 million): This price tag is expensive for a set-up man, and gives you pause, but he has been so valuable and durable despite such a heavy workload over the past few years it’s hard to see him not being tendered a contract. He could also be dangled as trade bait, but a reliever with one year left at that price may be too hard to move for anything worthwhile.
RP Ross Detwiler ($3.3 million): The left-hander saw his role diminish beginning in spring training when he was moved to the bullpen, then throughout the season with occasionally sporadic use and he didn’t even make the playoff roster. The Nationals could save some money by non-tendering Detwiler and using a cheaper left-hander to fill this spot, such as Xavier Cedeno or Matt Grace, or tendering him a contract and trading him later. The Nationals have said they plan to use Detwiler in similar fashion next season, but they also know he is open to being traded .
RP Jerry Blevins ($2.2 million): Although he struggled last season — a 4.87 ERA, highest in the bullpen, which seems like non-tender material — the left-hander was effective when used properly. He was incredibly tough on left-handed batters and finished the season strong, coming up big in the playoffs in key spots.
Third Year
RP Craig Stammen (Super Two, $2.1 million): Because the durable reliever was eligible for Super Two status after 2012, which grants an extra year of arbitration, he is entering his third year of arbitration and his final one is in 2016.
Second Year
C Wilson Ramos ($3.2 million)
C Jose Lobaton (Super Two, $1.2 million)
SP Stephen Strasburg ($8.1 million)
RP Drew Storen ($5.8 million)
First Year
INF Danny Espinosa ($2.3 million): After just missing the Super Two cutoff last winter, he finally reaches arbitration eligibility. He struggled offensively last season, so much so that dropping switch-hitting came up. But Espinosa offers elite defense and the versatility to play second base and shortstop, if Desmond is injured or resting. And although the Nationals are looking for a second baseman this winter, Espinosa is the backup plan. If the Nationals find a second baseman, Espinosa could fill the same role as much of last year, as a backup middle infielder.

The Most Powerful (Yet Simple) Advice I ve Ever Receivedreddit
I used to be a bit weary to start my own business, to tell you the truth.
I thought owning a business would make me feel free. Free to do what I loved, free to help others, free to make a difference in my own way.
But I saw so many examples of entrepreneurs that seemed to be enslaved by their business. I watched people I admire become consumed by their job and work themselves into the ground.
I heard over and over that you need to put in a ton of hours and hard work into your business, especially at the beginning. I thought that if I didn't wake up at 5 a.m. and work 14-hour days that it would mean I wasn't going to make it. In order to be successful, I had to work myself to the extreme. Then, once I had achieved success, only then could I take a step back and start to relax.
I was petrified. I saw business owners working crazy hours and pushing themselves to the limit. I heard so many stories about successful people getting completely burnt out, often ending up in the hospital for one reason or another. That was something I didn't want to experience. I didn't want to burn out. I get overwhelmed and have high enough anxiety as it is.
So instead of just taking precautions and preparing myself to not get burnt out, I became paralyzed. I couldn't do anything. I wanted so badly for everything to fall in my lap and be easy because I was so afraid of becoming overworked. I was frozen out of fear.
Fast forward several months. I was working three side jobs to support myself while I gave a half-assed attempt to grow my business. I finally got fed up. I was afraid of burnout, but this was not what I wanted either. I had to figure out a way to put energy into my business without going overboard. Without working ridiculous hours. Without flirting with burnout.
I sought help from a business coach, and the advice she gave me was both incredibly simple and powerful:
Make boundaries.
A lightbulb went off in my head. Boundaries!
Instead of avoiding burnout, which basically amounted to me not working much at all, I needed to prevent burnout. By setting up boundaries, my business could function the way I wanted it to.
Yes, building a successful business is hard work. But it doesn't have to mean pushing yourself to a breaking point.
I think all business owners should set boundaries in their business, especially at the beginning. It's much easier to set boundaries from the start than to work yourself to a pulp and then try to scale back your hours.
There are three main boundaries that everyone should set:
1. When you work.
Sometimes this is hard for entrepreneurs since you don't have a real "schedule" to stick to. There's no one telling you when to clock in and clock out.  So you have to set those times yourself.
Personally, I hate waking up early. So as a general rule, I have told myself that I will show up for work Monday through Thursday, 10 a.m. - 6 p.m. (with breaks throughout the day, of course).
2. When you don't work.
This is the most important one.  You need to know when to stop and unplug.  You need to know when work is completely off-limits.
I have 2 rules: I won't work after dinner, and I won't work on the weekends. I try to cut myself off at 6 p.m., but sometimes I work right up until it's time to eat dinner. But after dinner? Nope. I won't even respond to emails. That's my time to relax and hang out with my man. Same with weekends.
3. Vacations
Vacations aren't an option; they're a necessity. Everyone needs time to get away from their routine once in a while, to rest and recharge.
Some people like to set up a type of vacation schedule, like taking a vacation every six weeks or something like that. I tend to mostly base it off of how I feel. Vacations are my answer to everything. Feeling stressed or overwhelmed? Vacation. Antsy or bored? Vacation. Depressed or unmotivated? Vacation!
The best thing about boundaries is that you are in control. You get to decide where your boundaries are. My boundaries probably wouldn't work for most people, but they work for me. That's all that matters.
 
And boundaries can change. If there's ever a point where something doesn't feel right, adjust your boundaries. You are in control. Own your business, don't let your business own you.

The shutdown squad never learnsBy Jennifer Rubin December 2 Follow @JRubinBlogger
I had to laugh when an e-mail blast from oh-so-predictable Heritage Action came out, imploring the House to impale itself on the immigration issue:
From left, House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and President Obama last month. (Dennis Brack/Pool photo via Bloomberg)
According to reports, the Republican-controlled House is preparing to allow “GOP lawmakers an outlet to vent some of their frustrations” with the President.  The process described would do nothing to block his unilateral, unlawful changes which include granting quasi-legal status, work permits and Social Security numbers to those who are in the country illegally. Heritage Action released the following statement from chief executive officer Michael A. Needham:
“The fight is now, not next year. Americans expect real action, not a show vote. Conservatives in Congress must use the power of the purse to block President Obama’s executive actions — actions which are opposed by some in his own party. Rather than hand the President a blank check for amnesty, the House should attach a rider to their appropriations bill that stops the President’s unlawful amnesty program.”
Where to begin?
For starters, the people who ginned up the government shutdown might want to refrain from pronouncing on what will work and won’t work.
Second, why in the world would they want to have the fight now, when the GOP does not have the Senate, rather than in 2015, when it does? It makes as much sense as the 2013 shutdown — the last time they said the other guys would blink. (If, however, you want to pick a fight with the “establishment,” knowing grown-ups will not take your advice, this is the way to do it.)
In addition, they misrepresent or are unaware of what House Speaker John Boehner actually presented to the Republican conference today . In addition to a bill declaring the president’s move illegitimate, the House would pass a long-term funding bill for the rest of the government and a short-term funding bill for the immigration functions at issue — which allow the GOP to fight about this some more in 2015.
Finally, the American people overwhelmingly don’t want a shutdown, and a majority would blame the GOP if one occurred. Oh, and the sort of candidates who backed stunts like the shutdown lost in primary after primary this year.
In sum, there is no way to achieve what Heritage Action wants now with no Senate majority and Obama in the White House. (Sound familiar?) The GOP can take a run at separately withholding funding on immigration after a short-term funding measure runs out next year, but even then the fee-based system will likely continue. (The best chance of stopping the president may be in a lawsuit filed by the states.)
You don’t suppose Heritage Action knows all this and is simply trying to juice up year-end fundraising and get some attention after a disastrous year, do you?

GM's 79th recall: Bum headlights on 273K cars, SUVs
Chris Woodyard , USA TODAY 4:39 p.m. EST December 1, 2014
A 2009 Buick LaCrosse
261 CONNECT 117 TWEET 6 LINKEDIN 13 COMMENTEMAILMORE
General Motors is recalling 273,182 midsize SUV's and Buick LaCrosse sedans in the U.S. because the low-beam headlights can cut out, temporarily or permanently.
Besides 2006 to 2009 LaCrosse sedans, the recall includes a raft of SUVs under various GM brands. They include the 2006 and 2007 Chevrolet TrailBlazer and 2006 TrailBlazer EXT; 2006 and 2007 GMC Envoy and 2006 Envoy XL; 2006 and 2007 Buick Rainier; 2006 to 2008 Saab 9-7X and 2006 to 2008 Isuzu Ascender midsize SUVs.
The problem has been traced to the headlamp driver modules. If they aren't working properly, the low-beam headlamps and daytime running lamps could intermittently or permanently fail to illuminate, GM says. But this condition does not affect the high-beam headlamps, "marker lamps," turn signals, or fog lamps.
GM says it doesn't know whether the defect has resulted in accidents. But, like many of its recalls this year, it is bigger than just the U.S.: When vehicle in other countries are included, the total climbs to 316,357.
The headlight recall brings the total number of GM recalls this year to 79, the company said in a running tally that it keeps. The total number of vehicles involved is 24.5 million.
At the center of all the recalls is the continuing furor over defective ignition switches on thousands of cars from the past decade that can move out of the "run" position, disabling a car's air bags, power brakes and power steering. GM's independent administrator for compensation arising from deaths and injuries due to the switches on Monday increased the death count to 36, up one from the previous week.

Court dismisses sons property suit  says debt to mother can never berepaidWritten by Aneesha Mathur | New Delhi |
Posted: December 3, 2014 4:03 am
Observing that the “debt to mother can never be repaid”, the Delhi High Court has dismissed a civil suit filed by a man against his mother, seeking partition of a three-storey residential property in Jangpura. The court, in its order, also declared that the 92-year-old woman, Kaushal Kumari, was the owner of the entire premises.
The court of Justice Manmohan Singh dismissed the plea filed by Harish Relan, in which he had sought partition of the property as well as injunction against his mother and siblings from “interfering” in his family’s residence on the third floor of the house, on grounds that the plea was barred by limitation.
According to the judgment issued on Friday, the residential property at Jangpura was owned by Aishi Lal Relan, who died in 1999, leaving behind his wife and four children. His wife, Kaushal, then decided to reconstruct the house to three storeys.
In 2001, Harish shifted to the third floor with his wife and children, while his mother continued to occupy the ground floor. Due to financial problems, Kaushal first gave out the first floor on rent and then sold the second floor.
Later, she also sold the ground floor and filed a plea before court, seeking maintenance and right of residence in the Jangpura house. In 2006, Harish filed the suit for partition and sought a declaration from court that he was the absolute owner of the floor.
The court, however, noted that the siblings had signed relinquishment deeds in favour of their mother and given up claim to the property.
The court also noted that Harish had been aware of the sales made by his mother and approached the court after a long time.

Green tribunal wont back off on its order to ban 15-year-oldvehiclesBy: Express News Service | New Delhi |
Posted: December 3, 2014 4:01 am | Updated: December 4, 2014 5:02 pm
After an informal meeting between various stakeholders to devise a plan to execute the National Green Tribunal (NGT)’s order to ban 15-year-old vehicles on Delhi’s roads, sources said the tribunal gave indications that it won’t go back on its decision.
The meeting, which lasted two hours, was attended by officials from the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Petroleum Ministry, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), Delhi Police and various other departments.
The tribunal’s order had come on a petition by Vardhaman Kaushik, who contended “the level of particulates in Delhi is rising manifold and the reasons for this should be identified and curbed”.
Sources said the purpose of the meeting was to have a discussion on the issue and devise a method for smooth implementation of the order. The DPCC, which is Delhi’s pollution watchdog, has said pollution needed to be seen in its entirety. “Delhi’s pollution can’t be stopped without the cooperation of its neighboring states. Every aspect of pollution needs to be seen,” an official said, while noting that every scientific study has stated that pollution is increasing in the national capital.
The tribunal’s order on November 26 that all vehicles, which were more than 15 years old, wouldn’t be permitted to ply on the roads due to air pollution had led to jitters in the Delhi government. An official explained that implementation would require large-scale coordination between departments and manpower, which they don’t have. “Shortage of manpower is a big problem. We’ll have to fine the cars on the road and then bring them in. The police doesn’t have place to store them either,” the official said.
Reiterating that they lacked the required manpower, Delhi Traffic Police said they can only levy penalty for illegal parking but that does not deter people. The tribunal had responded by saying that if a car is towed away from Moolchand, it should be sent to Narela — to discourage future violations.
The NGT had also directed CPCB and DPCC to check all DTC buses, even if operating on CNG, and if the buses are found emitting in excess of prescribed standards, they must not be permitted to ply. Lawyers appearing for Delhi’s municipal bodies welcomed the meeting and said it had been “very fruitful”.

AAP says its the only party with transparentfundraisingBy: Express News Service | New Delhi |
Posted: December 3, 2014 3:57 am
A day after the BJP raised questions on its methods of funding, the AAP on Tuesday shot back a volley of questions and said it was the only party to practise transparency in financial dealings. The party said every donation it receives finds its way to AAP’s website.
Yogendra Yadav, the party’s chief spokesperson, said, “The AAP challenges the BJP to prove its motivated and uninformed allegations. The AAP is the only political party in India whose entire donations are in public domain and every penny collected is reflected on the party website. Any individual or organisation, including the BJP, are welcome to check all details about the donations and donors of the AAP. If someone pays by credit card, the transaction is on the site. It is similar with those who pay by cheque and with our new app, those that pay by cash are covered as well.”
Yadav said the AAP also wanted to pose five questions to the BJP on its financial dealings. “Is it not a fact that on March 29 this year, the Delhi High Court found the BJP guilty of receiving foreign funds in violation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act? Is it not a fact that the BJP has accepted donations of Rs 1.18 crore from the owner of Goa-based Timblo Pvt Ltd, Ms Radha Timblo, who was recently named by the Central government in its list of black money account holders abroad?” Yadav said.

Pvt schools will soon get common nurseryrulesBy: Express News Service | New Delhi |
Posted: December 3, 2014 3:56 am
Private schools have decided to formulate a common admission policy for all schools to follow this year. The committee for unaided schools has also said it will act strongly against any school found to be taking donations during the admission season.
“In order to make the system more transparent, we have decided to evolve a common admission policy that will contain broad terms of reference for all schools to follow this nursery admission season. We have already constituted a committee to do this and the committee will submit its report by December 7,” S K Bhattacharya, president of the action committee for unaided private schools, said.
He said once ratified, schools will be given directions to follow them. “We have also decided to form a redressal cell to address parent grievances related to admissions. The cell, consisting of seven people, will be independent, consisting of retired bureaucrats and government officials. We understand that we need to self-regulate ourselves and this is a step in that direction ,” Bhattacharya added.
The body will put up all information related to the guidelines on its website and will also direct schools to put them up on their notice boards.
Maintaining that the guidelines will be “flexible and offer maximum autonomy to schools”, the committee has also said that it will act strongly against any school found to be taking donations during the admission season.
“We will not be dictating any rules, but just communicating parameters within which all schools can make their admission criteria. That said, it will be communicated to schools that the committee does not support collecting donations, building fund or capitation fee during admission season. Parents can file complaints of schools found asking donations with the grievance cell,” Bhattacharya said.
Although schools have welcomed the move, some have expressed apprehension over how it will be executed. “It’s a good move and will streamline the nursery admission process. Parents will no longer have to run from pillar to post,” Jyoti Arora, principal, Mount Abu School, Rohini, said.
“It’s all a question of autonomy. As long as schools are given autonomy, it works. But we will only know how good the policy is once the guidelines are out,” principal of a leading school told Newsline, wishing not to be named.
“It looks like a good move on the face of it. But we will have to see what schools come out with,” Pooja Thakur, a parent from East Delhi, said.

CBI files chargesheet against GreenIndiaWritten by Debabrata Mohanty | Bhubaneswar |
Posted: December 3, 2014 3:55 am
Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) — which is probing the Orissa scam — Tuesday filed its first chargesheet against chit fund group Green India, accusing the company of defrauding depositors to the tune of Rs 30 crore at least.
The 188-page chargesheet filed in the special CBI court here, by investigating officer of the case S K Samal and CBI counsel Kalicharan Mishra, charged three top executives of the company under various sections of the IPC and under section 456 of the Prize Chit and Money Circulation (Banning) Scheme Act, 1978. The charge- sheet names as many as 300 people as witnesses in the case.
Chief Executive Officer of Green India Pradeep Singh and directors Sunil Panda and Jitendra Mishra have been charged under sections 420 (cheating), 120 B (criminal conspiracy), 409 and 509 of the IPC. Two of the three are now in judicial custody. CBI sources said it was only a preliminary chargesheet to adhere to the 180-day deadline after the filing of FIR. CBI had filed 44 FIRs against as many chit fund companies in June this year after taking over the probe from state CID and Bhubaneswar Police.
Meanwhile, the special CBI court on Tuesday rejected the bail plea of BJD MP Ramachandra Hansda, who was arrested by CBI for his alleged links with chit fund firm Nabadiganta Capital Service Limited. The court also turned down the bail petition of fixer Subhankar Nayak, whose diaries led to the interrogation of DIG Rajesh Kumar and SP Satish Gajbhiye Sunday in connection with the scam.

Stephen Hawking hails "life changing" speech upgrade0
“My old system was more than 20 years' old and I was finding it very difficult to continue to communicate effectively and to do the things I love to do,” he told reporters on Wednesday.
“With the improvements made I am now able to write much faster and it means I can continue to give lectures, write papers and books, and meet with my family and friends more easily.
”This new system is life-changing for me and I hope it will serve me well for the next 20 years.“
Intel said it had been working on the new platform, called ACAT (Assistive Context Aware Toolkit), in collaboration with Hawking for three years.
The new system, which is controlled by an infrared switch mounted on Hawking's glasses, has doubled his speech rates and sped up common tasks, such as finding a computer file, by about 10 times, Intel Labs engineer Lama Nachman said.
It uses predictive text algorithms developed with six-year-old British software company SwiftKey, similar to those found on smartphones, to select words after inputting just 10-15 percent of letters, significantly reducing the effort and time required.
The software will be made public early next year so it can be used to help other people with motor neuron diseases, quadriplegia and other disabilities.
”By making this technology freely available it has the potential to greatly improve the lives of disabled people all over the world,“ Hawking said.
One element has not been updated, however. Hawking, who has spent much of his career at Cambridge University, specified that his distinctive computerized voice, complete with North American accent, should not be changed.

15 scary facts about your lack of sleep  from new NatGeo docBy Emily Yahr December 2 Follow @emilyyahr
A new documentary by National Geographic illustrates the perils of sleep deprivation. (National Geographic TV)
You just enjoyed a long Thanksgiving weekend, so presumably you’re fairly well-rested, right? If not, prepare to be scared by some facts unleashed in a new National Geographic Channel documentary.
The two-hour “Sleepless in America,” a collaboration by NatGeo, National Institutes of Health and The Public Good Projects, debuted on Sunday night. The gist: Everyone is tired. No one gets enough sleep. And then this: Chronic sleep deprivation could have irreparable damage to your health.
NatGeo airs many documentaries, but with this one, they combined a timeless issue with a very timely topic: A lack of sleep hits close to home for pretty much everyone these days. “Sleep right now is one of those conversations that’s long overdue,” Army Surgeon General Patricia Horoho says in the film. “But it’s getting the national attention that it needs.”
It was a riveting two hours — no, really! — packed with anecdotes and interviews with experts who urge the need for change and more scientific research to help an increasingly sleepless culture. If you missed it (“Sleepless” airs again Dec. 7 at 9 a.m.), here are some of the facts that make us want to start going to bed very early every night:
1) Although there is debate about the magic number of sleeping hours, experts here recommend a solid eight. That said, 40 percent of American adults are sleep-deprived; the average American sleeps less than seven hours per night during the week. Meanwhile, 70 percent of adolescents also fall behind the recommended amount.
2) Lack of sleep is a serious problem in our constantly moving, 24/7 society: People are getting thousands of hours less sleep than they once were. As the documentary puts it, sleep is being “decimated” by our overstimulated culture with so much technology and gadgetry that distracts everyone all the time. Plus, people are overworked, so they no longer have enough time to do the things they want during the week. As a result, they stay up even later on weekends so they can compensate.
3) Sleep is “just as important as good nutrition, physical activity and wearing your seatbelt” — but many people greatly underestimate their need for it.
4) This quote from Mark Rosekind, member of the National Transportation Safety Board: “Every aspect of who you are as a human, every capability is degraded, impaired, when you lose sleep. What does that mean? Your decision-making, reaction time, situational awareness, memory, communication, and those things go down by 20 to 50 percent.”
5) When sleep gets shorter than seven hours a night, there’s evidence that there’s an increased risk for obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and even Alzheimer’s disease. The film also interviewed David Gozal at University of Chicago, a doctor who conducted a study linking an increased risk for cancer to lack of sleep.
6) An NIH study reduced subjects’ sleep to four hours a night and saw the impact on their weight. Turns out, sleeplessness increases an appetite for fatty foods, and the study showed that “short sleepers” consume 500 more calories a day than people who get enough sleep.
7) Almost all mental illnesses have associated sleep problems, experts say. In fact, sleep deprivation is nearly universal in every psychiatric condition, from bipolar disorder to anxiety disorders.
8) When you sleep, the brain clears out toxic chemicals — and one of the proteins that accumulates in the brain while you’re awake is associated with Alzheimer’s disease. Jeffrey Iliff, a doctor at Oregon Health and Science University, talks about his research into the link between poor sleep, clear thinking and Alzheimer’s.
9) Many factors are out of our control when it comes to sleep, particularly due to long hours at work or the type of job you have. The documentary looked in particular at health problems in shift workers required to work overnight, as it becomes much more difficult to manage blood sugar with those hours.
10) Another issue is people who operate machinery in late hours. “People that try and operate (driving their car, flying an airplane, running a train) during the night — they basically have to overcome physiological programming in their brain that says you’re supposed to be asleep,” Rosekind said.
11) The top cause of high-severity crashes on the road is fatigue.
12) There’s a term known as “microsleep,” defined as “momentary bouts of sleep that occur involuntary and can last up to 5 or 10 seconds.” It could occur at any time and have fatal consequences; the film profiled a man who lost his wife and two of his children after they were hit by a sleep-deprived driver.
13) Adolescents are biologically programmed to stay up later and wake up later, yet high schools force their students to wake up absurdly early. There’s a battle going on in high schools about later start times. The documentary featured one fight at Fairfax County Schools, where school starts at 7:20 a.m.
14) Studies show that high school school students who sleep more have higher test scores and lower rates of depression; the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends high schools should start at 8:30 a.m. or later. ( An update since the documentary was produced: Fairfax County Public Schools approved a change, and high school will start between 8 and 8:10 a.m. beginning in Fall 2015.)
15) One of the most frightening facts was all the benefits that we’re missing out on if we stay up too late every night. The good news is that sleep can “inspire creativity, re-balance emotions, help refresh cardiovascular health, metabolic health and boost our immune system.” We just have to figure out how to get it.
According to “Sleepless in America,” we’re supposed to sleep as soundly as this. (Olesia Bilkei/iStockphoto)

Minimum wage hike draws ire of business groupsMinimum wage hike draws ire, praise
Chicago Business Owners React To Minimum Wage Increase

With a new $13 minimum wage, will higher paychecks help or hurt Chicago businesses?
Chicago on Tuesday joined the growing ranks of major cities that have raised their minimum wage, a move decried by business groups as a jobs killer but touted by labor groups and other supporters as a way to lift Chicago workers and their families out of poverty.
The City Council overwhelmingly approved gradually raising Chicago's minimum wage to $13 an hour from $8.25 by mid-2019, with the first incremental hike to $10 coming in July. Meanwhile, state legislative leaders pulled the plug on a proposal to raise the statewide pay floor to $11 until January at the earliest.
Chicago's vote comes as concerns escalate about widening income inequality, and as cities and states across the country enact laws to boost the earnings of their lowest-paid workers.
Doormen at several luxury hotels in downtown Chicago scoffed at the notion they don't deserve a raise because they take in "unbelievable yearly incomes," the result of large tips. ( Alejandra Cancino )
In November, voters in Oakland, Calif., approved a referendum to push the minimum wage to $12.25 per hour from $9, and to $15 per hour from $10.74 in San Francisco, while voters in Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota approved measures that would raise the pay floors in those states to as much as $9.75 per hour.
"We look in our city, and we see the growing chasm between those who have and those who don't," said Ald. Will Burns, 4th, who led the Chicago council's charge to boost the minimum wage. "Raising the minimum wage is not the solution to all of these problems, but it is a key step toward bringing greater equality, bringing greater justice and bringing greater democracy to our city."
8
Business groups have vehemently opposed the city ordinance in favor of a state plan that would offer a more level playing field, warning that Chicago's hike would drive many of their members out of the city and force others to fire employees or close their doors. The minimum wage, they said, has a domino effect. If the lowest-paid employees get a raise, the rest of the workforce would also expect a raise, putting additional pressure on small businesses.
"Make no mistake, this will cost thousands of low wage jobs throughout Illinois as businesses flee," said a joint statement from the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce, the Illinois Restaurant Association, the Illinois Retail Merchants Association and the Illinois Hotel and Lodging Association.
"Further, it puts at severe risk the small businesses in border communities throughout Chicago that neighbor the suburbs and Indiana," the statement continued. "Such an increase will permanently depress new business development and hiring."
Theresa Mintle, chief executive of the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce, said the City Council vote was "disappointing." The focus now turns to Springfield, she said, where the chamber wants more time to put together a package with pro-business reforms.
Hank Meyer, owner of BJ's Market and Bakery, which has two locations on the South Side, is worried.
He expects that he will have to raise prices on his Southern-style menu items by 20 to 25 percent to cover the higher wages, which could put them out of reach for many of his customers. That wouldn't just hurt his business, he said, but also the neighborhoods, which don't have many restaurant options beyond fast food.
"I operate in a community where there are few discretionary dollars," Meyer said. "My customers are very price sensitive. I don't want to be a place relegated to special occasions."
Meyer, who opened the first BJ's at East 87th Street and South Stony Island Avenue in 1996 and the second at 79th Street and Racine Avenue in 2005, said that he employs about 45 people, and that 37 of them make minimum wage or just above. He may have to cut jobs if customers balk at shelling out $12 for a Southern-fried catfish rather than $9.99.

@mlljj63 Not to worry...those employees who experience an increased work load due to manpower cutbacks will almost certainly become disgruntled, organize into a union, and demand ever higher wages for all of the hard work that they're doing. It's a vicious cycle.

Meyer, who supports a statewide increase, said a hike only in Chicago may do more harm than good to the people it purports to help. If job candidates flock to the city from neighboring suburbs to compete for high-wage entry-level jobs, they might edge out locals with less experience, he said.
Meyer also worries that vendor costs might increase as they adjust their prices to the new wage, piling on expenses when his business model is fragile to begin with.
"This isn't about sound economic policy," Meyer said, "this is about the election cycle."
Labor groups celebrated the new law.
"I started crying," said Katelyn Johnson, executive director of Action Now, a member of the Raise Chicago coalition, which lobbied for the increase. "This means so much for so many people."
Johnson said Chicago's ordinance is "a victory, but it's just the first step." Up next, she said, is getting Illinois lawmakers to increase the state's minimum wage.
Last month, two-thirds of Illinois voters supported raising the state's minimum wage to $10 per hour in a nonbinding referendum.
Johnson said the minimum wage is a personal issue for her because her mother worked two jobs, often at minimum wage, to support the family.
"The fight is not over," Johnson said, adding that labor and community groups will continue to push for a $15 minimum wage. Fast-food workers demanding $15 per hour wages are planning dozens of protests across the country on Thursday, including at multiple restaurants in Chicago.
Douglas Hunter, 53, a fast-food worker who is planing to join the protests, said the city's minimum wage increase "is something to look forward to." He received word about the vote from a union organizer via text message and ran inside the McDonald's where he works to share the news. His co-workers clapped, he said.
Hunter, who makes $9.25 per hour as a maintenance worker at McDonald's, said he recently had to borrow money from his sister to pay his $775 rent. He was short nearly $200 because he's been scheduled to work 30-hour weeks.
"I'm struggling," he said.
McDonald's said in a statement, in part, that the company and its independent franchisees "support paying our valued employees fair wages aligned with a competitive marketplace and that are compliant with local and federal laws. We believe that any minimum wage increase should be implemented over time so that the impact on owners of small and medium-sized businesses — like the ones who own and operate the majority of our restaurants — is manageable."
The Oak Brook-based company added that 90 percent of its U.S. restaurants are independently owned and the company does not set wages for its 3,000 franchises.
Grant DePorter, president of Harry Caray's Restaurant Group, said it is too early to tell how the wage hike will affect his business, but he said the increase comes as businesses like his are dealing with higher health care costs.
Charlene Brandt, regional manager of government affairs for 7-Eleven, said the City Council vote was "not surprising," but she wants to know what the city plans to do to help small businesses cover the increase. Ninety-eight percent of the 7-Eleven locations in Chicago are owned by franchisees, she said, and they already are at a competitive disadvantage because Indiana has lower taxes on items such as cigarettes.
"How are they going to control their labor costs? Chances are they're going to cut hours, and they're going to end up covering shifts more," Brandt said of the franchisees.
But some shop owners applaud Chicago's new law.
Jennifer Pope, owner of Red Balloon children's boutiques, said she supports the increase to $13 because most hourly workers, she believes, are not teens angling for extra spending cash but adults supporting families.
"It's predominantly grown-ups and predominantly women, and a lot of them are mothers," Pope said. "This would be something that would stabilize families here and now, which would ultimately cost us less."

U.S. stocks gained Tuesday after declining in the previous session -- with the Dow Jones industrial average hitting a new record close.
The Dow, S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite each ended up 0.6%.
Its 103-point climb put the Dow at its new all-time closing high of 17,879.55. That's about 51 points above the prior record close, set Friday.
Monthly Markets Checkup: 6 things for December
The blue-chip Dow has now hit a closing high 32 times in 2014.
A barrel of oil as traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 1.8% in the wake of Monday's rebound, which in turn followed a huge 10% plunge Friday .
Falling oil prices this year have sent investors running out of energy stocks. But Tuesday, energy stocks were a gusher of gains for speculators, with shares from Exxon ( XOM ) to EOG Resources ( EOG ) jumping.
On Monday, the Nasdaq took a 1%-plus pounding as the price of oil pulled out of a free fall . The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 also ended down.
The nation's top CEOs trimmed their forecasts for sales and capital spending but boosted their hiring plans over the next six months, according to the Business Roundtable's fourth-quarter survey.
Newly built homes and schools boosted construction spending in October to the highest level since May. The Commerce Department says construction spending rose 1.1% in October , after having slipped 0.1% in September.
In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index gained 0.4% to close at a seven-year high Tuesday. The Wall Street Journal said it appeared to be largely due to speculation that the Bank of Japan might start buying up exchange-traded funds. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 1.2%.
European stocks ended mixed, with Britain's FTSE -- up 1.3% -- a big mover.
The Hang Seng plunged 2.6% Monday as police used pepper spray and clubs against protesters demanding democratic reforms in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.

Asias biggest sewage treatment plant running at 10 pccapacityWritten by Lalmani Verma | Lucknow |
Posted: December 3, 2014 4:10 am
A legal battle over payment of dues has brought Asia’s largest Sewage Treatment Plant to a grinding halt with the unit now working at just 10 per cent of its 345 MLD (million litres a day) capacity.
Set up in Bharwara area on outskirts of Lucknow city, the Rs 169-crore STP did not treat the sewage for almost one year following a dispute between the contractor firm Hydroair Tectonics (PCD) Limited, Mumbai, and UP Jal Nigam. That STP has been developed under phase-II of Gomti Action Plan for reducing pollution in Gomti river.
Lucknow district magistrate Raj Shekhar alongwith officials of Jal Nigam, municipal corporation and Irrigation Department, inspected the STP Tuesday and found that it was being run by the contractor, as per the direction of the court, only at 10 per cent of total capacity. They also found that almost all the machines were rusting while against the required staff of 60, only four were working.
The DM said a meeting of Jal Nigam, municipal corporation and the contractor will be convened soon to discuss the issue soon. The Jal nigam has been directed to submit water quality report every day for one month to DM office to assess the functioning of STP.
Hydoair Tectonics (PCD) Limited Chairman H B Singh had recently told The Indian Express that STP was operational and treating sewage.
He had also confirmed that his firm has filed a case in Lucknow district court as well as Lucknow Bench of Allahabad High Court against UP Jal Nigam on the issue of delay in payment of Rs 47 crore.
Sources in Jal Nigam said the laboratory, where pollution levels in the samples of  untreated and treated sewage water is supposed to be checked was lying closed for almost eight months. Local villagers have demolished a portion of the boundary wall and graze their animals in STP compound.
The work on Bharwara STP had begun on July 18, 2008 and then Chief Minister Mayawati had dedicated it to public on January 15, 2011, on her birthday. At that time the STP was not functioning in full capacity as only eight drains were connected with the two pumping stations of the Haider Canal and Kukrail that time. Six months later, STP had become fully operational as Jal Nigam had then connected all 26 drains of city to the STP and it was treating about 300 million litres of the city’s total discharge.
The DM today also inspected the Daulatganj STP which was found working at 56 MLD against the inflow of about 70 MLD. DM said a proposal to enhance its capacity by 14 MLD at a cost of Rs 20 crore has been submitted to the government. continued…

Jeff Bezos defends Amazon s lack of profits  stance on publishersJeff Bezos defends Amazon's lack of profits, stance on publishers
Reuters Dec 3, 2014, 03.20AM IST

Amazon.com Inc
(Jeff Bezos, the chief executive…)
NEW YORK: Jeff Bezos , the chief executive of Amazon.com Inc , was unapologetic about his twenty-year-old company's lack of profit during a rare public appearance on Tuesday, noting he spends just six hours a year on investor relations.
Bezos also discussed Amazon's acrimonious dispute with publisher Hachette Book Group and his purchase of the Washington Post. He acknowledged that Amazon had a succession plan in place, but remained tight-lipped about the details.
His comments come a day after Moody's Investors Service downgraded its outlook on Amazon to "negative," citing the company's upcoming debt offering and the "lack of visibility" about how the funds would be deployed.
Investors have grown increasingly unhappy about Amazon's spending and lack of disclosure about future plans. Its shares have fallen more than 18 per cent this year, despite a 14 per cent rise in the Nasdaq.
Bezos, relaxed in jeans and a gray jacket, defended Amazon's culture as one willing to spend on new projects, even if they flop like its poor-selling Fire phone.
"We are a large company, but we are also still a start-up. There is a lot of volatility in start-ups," Bezos said at a conference organized by the Business Insider blog in New York.
Bezos, an investor in Business Insider, defended Amazon's approach during its drawn-out contract dispute with Hachette, which came to light after Amazon delayed deliveries and removed pre-order options for several Hachette titles. The dispute was settled in November.
Publishers are in better shape because of e-books, which became popular after Amazon launched the Kindle e-reader in 2007, he said, adding that books are still too expensive.
"It's difficult for incumbents who have a sweet thing to embrace change," Bezos said. "Making reading more affordable is not going to make authors less money. ... It's going to make authors more money."
Bezos entered another embattled industry last year when he bought the Washington Post from the Graham family. He was initially surprised when approached about the sale, but said Don Graham convinced him. He plans to turn the Post into a national and international newspaper.
Bezos, 50, also acknowledged that there is a succession plan in place for him and his executives. When asked to reveal the next generation of leadership, he said: "It's a secret."

Capitals vs. Canucks: Game 24 discussion threadBy Alex Prewitt December 2 Follow @alex_prewitt
Braden Holtby makes his first career start against Vancouver (AP Photo/Canadian Press, Darren Calabrese).
The Washington Capitals (10-9-4, 24 points) and Vancouver Canucks (16-7-1, 33 points) meet Tuesday night at Verizon Center, each coming off a weekend defeat and looking to climb back on track. For the Capitals, this marks the first of just four home games this month, the calendar heavy with trips to Eastern Conference foes and, particularly around the holidays, Metropolitan Division rivals. The Canucks, meanwhile, split the first two matchups of a six-game road trip but still rank fourth overall in the Western Conference in points.
Washington returned home late Saturday night after its worst loss of the season in Toronto. The fortune hasn’t been much better here; the Capitals have a 5-4-3 home record that ranks just 10th in the Eastern Conference.
“We haven’t been nearly good enough at home, and we want to make our building a tough building to come into, and that hasn’t been the case this year,” forward Troy Brouwer said. “We’ve got to at least start making teams uneasy about coming into the Verizon Center and having to play in front of our fans, because it’s been too easy on them so far this season.”
Seeking more production from two lines, Coach Barry Trotz flipped Brooks Laich and Jason Chimera, moving the former to the third line beside Eric Fehr and Joel Ward, and the latter to the fourth line with Andre Burakovsky and Jay Beagle. In 31 total games this season — mostly Chimera’s, because Laich missed 17 games with a left shoulder injury — the two have combined for two goals and three assists.
“I just wanted to get him through the [first] two games [back from injury] and I think he’s a pretty important guy for us,” Trotz said of Laich. “We’ve got to get some production out of the line. They’re going to face pretty good opponents. I need to build that line. I need some production from, it was the Chimmer, Fehrsie and Wardo, on a consistent level, then we need the other lines to contribute as well. I’m looking for some answers, some chemistry on different lines.”
Asked if he wanted to see more from Chimera, Trotz replied, “I think he’s skating as well as he has. Just some production. He’s got a lot more poise in the offensive zone than he’s shown. For the most part, he’s done a good job on the penalty kill. We need some production from all lines, really.”
The Capitals will practice Wednesday at Kettler Capitals Iceplex before flying to Carolina and beginning a two-game road trip against the Hurricanes and New Jersey Devils that will last into the weekend. For now, the discussion thread is open and the usual tidbits are below. Thanks for reading.

Traveling for Thanksgiving Leave NowTraveling for Thanksgiving? Leave now.
Harriet Baskas TODAY
Email
Brennan Linsley / AP
Travel experts recommend leaving Tuesday in advance of Winter Storm Cato if you're driving to Thanksgiving in the Northeast.
Over the river, through the woods and stuck on the highway or in an airport before getting anywhere near grandma’s house?
It’s a very possible scenario this Thanksgiving as snow, ice, rain and winter storms are forecast for the East Coast from New England down through Georgia.
DRIVING?
Winter Storm Cato will likely hit the east coast with gusto on Wednesday with the rain/snow line staying close to the busy Interstate 95 corridor,” according to The Weather Channel , so the consensus among travel experts is to leave now.
“If you can get out in advance of the storm today, do it,” said AAA spokeswoman Heather Hunter.
And if you can't leave on Tuesday, it may be best to wait. Instead, leave on Turkey Day when the roads are supposed to be clear, said Hunter.
Video: Severe weather moving up from Georgia could put a damper on holiday travel, reports TODAY's Al Roker. A low pressure system off the Florida coast could become a classic Nor'easter by Wednesday with an icy mix of 9-12 inches of snow in the interior of New England.
Bad weather or not, AAA Travel predicts that almost 90 percent, or 41.3 million Thanksgiving travelers will be on the road this holiday. The Wednesday before Thanksgiving is statistically the worst day to travel , according to data crunched by Google Maps.
If you must leave Wednesday, get on the road before 2 p.m. or after 7 p.m., to try to avoid the traditional 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. Thanksgiving rush.
After Thanksgiving, wait until Sunday to drive home. Post-Thanksgiving traffic can be 40 percent worse on Saturday, according to Google's data.
FLYING?
If you’re one of the 24.6 million passengers scheduled to travel globally on a U.S. airline during this Thanksgiving travel period, you may have to alter those plans.
In advance of the storms flights are being canceled and many airlines, including Alaska Airlines ,  American , US Airways , Delta , JetBlue , Southwest Airlines ,  Spirit , United and  Virgin America have issued travel waivers on their websites that allow passengers to change their flight dates or receive refunds at no extra charge.
Even if you want to take an earlier or later flight, the challenge may be finding one
“Airlines are at capacity this holiday season and there’s not much flexibility,” said Expedia spokeswoman Sarah Gavin. “But if you can get around the weather, and your airline has issued a flex policy, go for it.”
If your flight is canceled and you really need to get to grandma’s house, consider alternatives such as buses, trains and rental cars.
However, remember that Thanksgiving is the busiest drive time of the year. You may have to call several agencies to get a car, or look beyond the airport to a larger neighborhood location for availability, said Hertz Corporation spokeswoman Paula Rivera.
SKIPPING?
And if you can’t make it grandma’s this year, “make it an adventure,” said Gavin.
“Many gorgeous hotels in downtown business areas are empty during Thanksgiving because the business travelers aren’t there, so you can get some great last minute deals on hotels.”

NEW DELHI (AP) — A video showing two sisters in northern India hitting back at men who allegedly harassed them on a crowded bus has drawn huge attention in a country where hundreds of thousands of women silently endure sexual harassment daily.
The video, filmed by a passenger and aired on several television channels Monday, shows the two young women hitting, punching and beating their harassers with a belt, as other passengers silently look on. The women, identified only by their first names, Arati and Pooja, said they lashed out at the men after enduring lewd comments and pawing from them.
"One of the boys started touching my sister and making kissing gestures," Arati told reporters. "I told him to go away or I would teach him a lesson. Then he called another boy saying that we have to beat up two girls. And then the other boy got on the bus."
The sisters said that no one on the bus tried to help them. Instead, other passengers told them to not provoke the men, because they might later attack them or throw acid on them.
Press Trust of India reported that the video was shot Friday as the sisters were on their way to college.
By late Sunday, police in the state of Haryana had arrested three men and were investigating the incident.
As the news of the women's actions spread, Manohar Lal Khattar, Haryana's chief minister, lauded the bravery of the two women and said they would be honored during India's Republic Day celebration in January.
The video drew a massive response on social media, with many Indians applauding the sisters' bravery, while criticizing the passengers for failing to come to their aid.
"Salute to #RohtakBravehearts who stood against molestation & gave a fitting lesson to culprits. Shameful that none in the bus stood up 4 thm," Naveen Jindal, a federal legislator from Haryana, tweeted.
Sexual violence and harassment faced by Indian women has been the subject of a heated debate in India since the fatal gang rape of a young woman on a moving bus in New Delhi in December 2012.
Hundreds of thousands of ordinary Indians took to the streets in protest after that gruesome attack. The anger pushed the government to overhaul laws to make for more stringent measures to fight attacks against women.

Kumaoni cuisine in the Corbett National ParkElusive Tigers, Charging Elephants and Kumaoni Food at Corbett
What has the Corbett National Park got to do with food? Plenty!

Jim's Jungle Retreat
The Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand has had many a fascination for me. Being the oldest national park of the country, my first introduction to this forest (as is true for most of us), came from the exciting stories of tigers, leopards and wild elephants that were written by Jim Corbett. Jim Corbett for me, was a unique entity in himself, having begun as a hunter (famous for hunting man-eaters) and going on to become a serious conservationist. He was a man of many talents and his world of writing has enthused many a soul - certainly mine. 
The drive to Corbett from Delhi can take one about 6 hours, however, if you take the old road one can add an hour or so, but that extra time is absolutely worth it. Driving through rural India, rather than zipping by on an expressway, is a wonderful entry into a whole world of colour and culture. Stopping at a roadside dhaba for lunch and walking along a multitude of roadside stalls to sample the snacks of the region adds to the fun – particularly for food lovers. Crossing into Uttarakhand, wherein lies the Corbett National Park one is fairly impressed by the change in manners and attitude of the locals.
Library Verandah
What has this to do with food you may ask? My answer is PLENTY!!! As one delves into the world of lodges and retreats while searching for a good clean room that is near the jungle, the search for good food is also on. The lodges around the park create a spell of unusual names (most of them immortalizing Jim Corbett), offer a range of rooms but seem disappointing when it comes to the food – as most of them serve the typical chicken-tikka-palak-paneer menus. Food for me is an integral part of a journey as it invokes several memories and even if one doesn’t see a tiger one can take home something more than just a comfortable stay. 
While I have been to several resorts (and I am not classifying the 5 star properties in this), none come close to the magic of Jim’s Jungle Retreat, a true wildlife resort owned by Daleep Akoi, who has always shared a deep relationship with forest and conservation. It is a pleasant surprise to see the endeavours of Daleep and “JJR’s” General Manager, Rati Karwal, as they strive to make the jungle experience a memory for life for their guests. Not only do the spacious rooms, wonderful topiary and genteel staff make one comfortable from the onset, the food is also exceptional thanks to most of the fruits, vegetables and herbs being grown in the organic garden on the property. The property also has large amounts of curry leaf trees, night jasmine trees, rhododendron and mulberry shrubs growing all over the place. And Daleep and Rati have used this natural magic in creating their own blends of herbal and floral teas, which guests can enjoy at any given time. The chef has his own style of cooking and there is so much one can learn and experience in his kitchens – specially when it comes to the local Kumaoni cuisine that hardly anyone else offers. Kumaoni food is simple and elegant with a minimal use of oil and spices. The flavours are subtle and the only great heating spice is the Pahadi green chilli which can really get your ears smoking! I loved the simple local meals of mandua rotis, lai ki sabzi, rajma, rice and mutton curry that were served. What really struck me as commendable was the effort of the chef to keep himself updated on other cuisines and trends and his openness to learning new things. This is achieved by conducting cookery workshops (which is probably a first in the area) and having professionals come in and do special cookery sessions for the guests and staff.
A morning inside Corbett National ParkComing to the main reason for visiting Corbett, it is of course, the park ride. Setting out in an open jeep is a thrill with the cold morning air swirling around you as you drive through the mist-laden grassland. The goal is to be one with nature as best as can be. The forest is quite a dense one and the tiger is elusive. However, there are times when you can almost feel one watching you through the elephant grass, which is tall and thick enough to conceal full-grown elephants! As we drove past a particularly thick patch, we noticed some movement and got excited at the prospect of a tiger sighting. However, what we had encountered was a group of wild elephants who decided that we were too close for their comfort and so did an adrenalin rushing charge at us! The rest of the ride was peaceful and colourful owing to the feathered treasures of the park. Then it was back to the retreat.
What I liked best about Jim’s Jungle Retreat is the fact that the property not only resembles a jungle, but a wildlife and nature lover has a lot more to look forward to than just visiting the park for the morning and evening safaris. The property has an apiary wherein two types of bees are bred and visitors are taken through a detailed “tour” of how honey is made. One can also approach the head gardener and gain a lot of knowledge on edible and medicinal plants of the region, which he has proudly and lovingly nurtured. In the evenings, the inhouse naturalist Rehman, shares his safari experiences and decodes the jungle and it’s laws through carefully-put-together and selected slideshows and films which not only showcase the immense work body that Jim Corbett created but also educates people on the importance of supporting conservation projects.
The herd that chased us
Although I visited the place for only a couple of days, the kind of oneness I experienced with Nature and her children was incredible. It is important to maintain the sanctity of the parks and so lessen the man-animal conflicts and have a better policing force to protect our wildlife.

Nutella Strategy and the Power of Complex Thinkingreddit
"Nutella strategy" is my favorite term for reductionist marketing.
I adopted the term from a Chicago-based advertising industry veteran many years ago. Whenever one of his people came with a bad campaign idea, his comeback would be: "Go back to the drawing board. This is Nutella strategy!"
When I finally asked him what that meant, he said that he loved Nutella. But breakfast is like strategy. Too much of one thing is good for nothing.
Business schools used to be puppy mills for Nutella strategists. And because this led to a long list of economic and social problems, these days they work very hard to move outside of conventional marketing silos such as branding and consumer behavior.
One technique that can accomplish this is complex thinking or, as philosophers call it, irreductionism.
In a nutshell, irreductionism states that nothing can be explained by reducing it to some other supposedly readymade entity because each entity is never given but rather fabricated.
In their book, Speculative Turn, philosophers Levi Bryant, Nick Srnicek, and Graham Harmon describe irreductionism as an approach that renders "all entities equally real (though not equally strong) insofar as they act on other entities. While nonhuman actors such as germs, weather patterns, atoms, and mountains obviously relate to the world around them, the same is true of Harry Potter, the Virgin Mary, democracies, and hallucinations."
Let's look at three simple principles to make this thinking more concrete.
All Actors are Made Up
One defining characteristic of Nutella strategy is its tendency to treat all actors as natural categories. One principle of irreductionism, in turn, is that all actors are made up. For instance, saying that the Nutella market refers to the relationships between Nutella consumers and Ferrero (the Nutella producer) is a classic Nutella-strategy move. While such a definition can be useful in some cases, more often than not, the idea that there is a Nutella consumer "out there" makes managers already forget all the work and other actors needed for such a consumer to actually be created and sustained. Creating a market takes a lot of time and energy because it entails reshaping people -- realigning their interests and ambitions with yours. Only eventually, they will become your consumers.
All Elements are Agents
Another principle of irreductionism is that human, nonhuman, and dead material are all real and can act. This is again different from Nutella strategy where agency is usually exclusive to human beings. For this reason, Nutella strategists would never understand that unhappy Orangutans from the islands of Sumatra and Borneo can significantly undermine Nutella's market success. For a recent illustration, consider how activist organizations Greenpeace and the World Wide Fund challenged Nutella at least temporarily by giving voice to this hitherto excluded group of non-human market actors. Because every piece of a market constructed is immersed in a network that is constantly making and remaking itself, complex thinking can bring the relationship between Nutella, the globally growing demand for palm oil, and the problem of deforestation in areas where these animals live into clearer relief -- long before a full-fledged brand image crisis hits and damage control is in order.
All Causality is Political
A third principle of irreductionism states that all causality is political. To illustrate this point, forget Nutella for a moment and consider the recent consumer research finding that ovulation -- the time each month when women are most fertile -- influences the desire for variety in female consumer choice. From within a purely causality-based perspective, such an argument seems sound and conclusive. An irreductionist perspective, in turn, can add the awareness that biological determinism does not exist in an ideological vacuum. Smart marketers figure that ignoring the political content of seemingly objective consumer science can come at a high price. At best, marketers can unintentionally provoke brand backlash from observers pointing to manosphere cave-dweller dreams. And at worst, they become complicit in perpetuating problematic gender stereotypes.
Applying these three principles can help marketers make smarter and more sustainable decisions. And while branding or consumer behavior continue to be important, designing a market is ultimately about leveraging the capacities of actors and elements -- from local supermarket shoppers to orangutans in Borneo -- in ways that create assemblages truly greater than the sum of their parts.

WHO: More than 17 000 people infected with E...Barack Obama
(The World Health Organization…)
FREETOWN: The World Health Organization says the number of people infected with Ebola has passed 17,000, as Sierra Leone announced that its 10th doctor has been sickened.
Numbers released today by WHO include about 200 new cases since data was published yesterday. More than 6,000 people have died.
The vast majority of the infected are in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.
Also today, Sierra Leonean Health Ministry spokesman Jonathan Abass Kamara said that Dr. Thomas Rogers has tested positive for the disease and was admitted a day earlier to the British-built treatment center in Kerry Town, near the capital. Rogers had been working at Connaught Hospital in Freetown.
He is being cared for at a special clinic reserved for infected health care workers that is staffed by British army medics.

Lokayukta sends special report to Gov over delay in disqualification of 2MLAsBy: Express News Service | Lucknow |
Posted: December 3, 2014 4:14 am
The Uttar Pradesh Lokayukta Tuesday sent a special report to Governor Ram Naik over the delay in initiating disqualification proceedings against two MLAs, BSP’s Umashankar Singh and BJP’s Bajrang Bahadur Singh, for continuing to work as contractors for the state government even after being elected to the Assembly.
In an interim report to Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav in February, Lokayukta N K Mehrotra had recommended that the matter of violation of Representation of People Act by the MLAs be forwarded to then Governor BL Joshi for his consideration.
Lokayukta had found that Umashankar and Bajrang Bahadur continued to work as contractors for PWD even after being elected as MLAs, which is in violation of RP Act and attracts disqualification.
Mehrotra had said he forwarded the matter to CM in an interim report as a Supreme Court mandated that the complaints related to disqualification of legislators be sent to competent authorities without delay.
Mehrotra had started the inquiry against Umashankar after a complaint was filed by one Subhash Chandra, alleging that his firm Chhatra Shakti Constructions continued to take PWD contracts even when he became an MLA in March, 2012.
Lokayukta had then asked the list of all those legislators who were workings as contractors and the name of Bajrang Bahadur figured in the list. Mehrotra had then sought replies from both MLAs on finding it in violation of section 9 (A) of RP Act.
Sources said the government had referred the matter to Raj Bhawan. The Governor had then sought the opinion of Election Commission on the matter.
In his special report sent to Governor Tuesday, Mehrotra has said the action is yet to be taken in the matter even as the MLAs have completed half of their term. Citing the delay in action, Mehrotra said the violation of rules is corruption and remaining a spectator to corruption also amounts to graft.
Umashankar is an MLA from Rasra constituency of Ballia while Bajrang Bahadur is an MLA from Pharenda seat of Maharajganj district.

Your assessment is spot on Mr. Bhat. Previously whenever Mirza has rallied, it has corrected the following day. With positive global cues and with buying now coming back in small and midcaps, Mirza should aim for new highs. The first half an hour of trade is crucial, if it breaches 48, we are headed to newer highs which might easily take us to new levels. My own fair guess is 68-70

Conviction in Fatal Crash Vacated Over Link to GM Recall
Female Created Southern California Accessory Company  31 Bits  Works To Empower Ugandan Women One Necklace Sale At A Timereddit
Shopping for a cause has become a trend driving American consumers' purchases in recent years.  From Tom's to Warby Parker, which both utilize a one-for-one model companies are increasingly seeking ways to utilize their products to create a greater impact.  Beyond the one-for-one trend lies companies who are utilizing proceeds from sales to directly impact the artisans and labor working to create their products.  As the holiday season approaches, one female-created business is not only bringing fashionable jewelry to consumers, but also working to empower women in Uganda.
In 2007, a then 21-year-old Kallie Thomson headed from Orange County, California to Uganda.  2007 marked one year after the closure of the internally displaced persons ("IDP") camps the Ugandan government forced northern Ugandans into in the wake of Joseph Kony's terror over the country and its people.  Under Kony's reign, young Ugandan boys were stolen from their homes at night and drug into a darkness filled with terror.  If they didn't march their feet fast enough into the void, the other children soldiers Kony had stolen were forced to murder them.  The young girls that Kony and his troops captured were oftentimes forced to be "brides" of Kony's soldiers and endured frequent rapes.  As Kony marched through Uganda, he not only swept up its young people's innocence, but also allegedly took the lives of over 100,000 people.
As the last IDP closed and the terror of Kony slowed, another ugly truth emerged:  Uganda's economy was victimized.  When northern Ugandans exited the IDP camps in 2006, they left without any belongings and few ways to earn a significant living.  With one crisis slowly foddering out, another emerged:  How to rebuild an economy destroyed by guerilla warfare and encourage its tortured population to begin living again.
It was in this landscape that a young, bright-eye and hopeful Thomson sought to impact a community beyond her college home of California. Thomson initially went to Uganda to utilize her nutrition-based education to work in orphanages and ensure that children were fed properly.  Realizing that many of the children in Ugandan orphanages are poverty orphans, children whose biological parents are alive but turn them over to orphanages because they cannot financially take care of them, a light went off in Thomson's head:  What if she could help Ugandan children's mothers avoid the economic crises that force many of them to give up their babies to orphanages?
One day while working in an after school program in Uganda, Thomson met a group of women making jewelry composed of intricate beads crafted out of paper the women had acquired from old posters.  After getting to know the women, they invited Thomson into their homes.  Inside the walls of their homes, Thomson was provided a glimpse into the life of post-IDP displaced Ugandan women.  These women not only lived in deep poverty, but Thomson also recognized that many of the women's lives were also impacted by domestic violence, HIV/AIDS and illiteracy.  In their work, though, Thomson saw women who dreamed of more for their lives--women who wished for a future.
While the then 21-year-old Thomson knew she wanted to help the women she met in Uganda, her path towards doing so wouldn't become clear until a group of the women, upon learning that Thomson was headed back to the United States, asked if she could sell their jewelry there.  "I was taking some development classes at the time, but I was really nervous about making a commitment to sell their jewelry.  I was 21-years-old, and doing so felt over my head.  There are so many people who come in and out of their lives with the best of intentions who say they're going to do things for them, but then things don't work out.  I didn't want that to happen, so I told them all I could do was buy a big box of the jewelry from them," Thomson noted.
With her box of Ugandan beaded jewelry in hand, Thomson headed back to the United States and the place she calls home, Klamath Falls, Oregon.  A small farming community, Thomson's high school hosts a craft fair every holiday season.  Little did she know, but her hometown high school's craft fair not only ended up paving Thomson's destiny, but provided a platform to help some of Uganda's neediest women.  "I just went up there and brought the box.  It was gone in a week.  I thought that if the jewelry could sale in Klamath Falls, then it could sell everywhere," Thomson recalled.
That realization powered the founding of 31 Bits , an accessory company based in southern California, whose lines are created by Ugandan artisans.  31 Bits, though, is more than accessory company.  Rather, Thomson and her four classmates at the time, Alli Swanson, Anna Toy, Brooke Hodges, and Jessie Simonson, sought to restore in Uganda's women what had been taken from them.  The group of then 21-year-olds studying at Vanguard University in Orange County, California were determined to not only provide female Ugandan artisans with fair wages for their accessory designs, but also with an education, coping skills and empowerment.
In 2008, Thomson moved to Uganda to develop 31 Bits' Ugandan development program, while her four classmates remained in California to build 31 Bits' business by selling the jewelry to classmates and at craft fairs.  Initially, there were six Ugandan women in 31 Bits' development program.  Within six months, that number jumped to 30.  After a year, 60 women were participating in the program.  Today, 31 Bits works to empower 165 Ugandan women between the ages of 19 to 61 through its five-year holistic development program.  "The first year in Uganda was all about learning what the women needed.  Our program is based on the needs we've learned about over the last six years and addressing the needs of the women we work with," Thomson explained.
For women in northern Uganda, the needs aren't simple.  Yet, they aren't unique to the country, as American women face some of the same issues that Ugandan women encounter.  "We had to address domestic violence first," Thomson noted.  Gender-based violence against women is a lasting effect of the wars that have been carried out across Uganda's soil. According to the United Nations , 59-percent of ever-married women between the ages of 15 and 49 in Uganda have experienced physical or sexual violence.
To help Ugandan women overcome domestic violence, 31 Bits not only provides them with counseling and psychosocial education, but also brings the community's men into the conversation.  Through monthly men-to-men talks, 31 Bits hopes to end the cycle of domestic violence in Uganda by allowing men in families to discuss the role they play in empowering their families.  "We look at a person as a whole.  Our programs address what's going on physically, spiritually, economically and socially.  Every person struggles with things in each of these areas.  With respect to domestic violence education, we address how to handle a confrontation and work with your family members or husband.  We do a lot of trauma training; a lot of our women have gone through different trauma than that solely related to the war," Thomson explained.
Another important program 31 Bits provides the women in its development program is HIV testing and treatment.  Of the orphans in Uganda, one million were orphaned due to AIDS, according to the United Nations .  As of 2013, 7.4-percent of Ugandan adults are HIV or AIDS positive.  However, the disease disproportionately affects young women.  For those between 20-24 years of age, 6.3-percent of women and 2.4-percent of men are HIV positive in Uganda.  The UN attributes the higher prevalence of HIV and AIDS amongst Uganda's women in part to the sexual violence carried out against women and women's inability to negotiate for safer sex.
While sexual violence and the inability to negotiate for safer sex have caused Ugandan women to fall victim to HIV and AIDS at higher rates than men, lack of access to education has prevented large numbers of these women from properly treating their conditions.  "Most of our women are uneducated.  When they find out they are HIV positive, they generally receive one hour of education on how to handle the disease.  For a woman who is illiterate, that is not enough to learn about what their body is going through," Thomson explained.
According to Thomson, 23-percent of women in 31 Bits' development program are HIV positive.  Recognizing that these women weren't being properly counseled and educated about the disease, 31 Bits partnered with The AIDS Support Organization (TASO) to ensure that the women not only receive proper testing and care, but knowledge about their condition.  "The education is really miscued.  There was one woman in our program who was buying HIV medicine on the black market and taking it after being with an HIV positive partner.  She was doing this even though she had never been tested.  She didn't want to get tested, because in Uganda, there is so much stigma surrounding HIV and AIDS, and she didn't want anyone to know.  She lived with the fear and burden that she had HIV for two years.  Then, she was tested on our compound and the test showed that she was HIV negative.  She was so stoked, but she couldn't believe it, so she had us test her again.  And again, it showed that she was negative," Thomson recalled.
While that woman's story was one to celebrate, not every woman that 31 Bits serves sees the same results.  "We're stoked to have the testing on our compound, because we get to be with the women right when they find out.  Sometimes, though, it's a time of mourning.  Sometimes, we have to talk with the women about what it looks like to be HIV positive and help her decide when it's time to share her status and be open with people," Thomson said.
Since 2007, Thomson and her college friends have worked tirelessly to give back the pieces of women's lives that were taken away from them by Kony's terror.  More than returning Ugandan women to where they were before Kony's reign began in 1986, though, 31 Bits seeks to give Ugandan women something more important:  A future.  Noting that "every purchase you make can either have a positive or negative impact on the world," 31 Bits is not only focused upon bringing quality, designer jewelry to fashion forward women, but on empowering women to be their best.  "We enter a woman into the program based on need.  We are not looking at whether they are the best qualified to make jewelry.  Rather, we are looking at who needs this job and who needs it right now.  That woman could be a 19-year-old who has two kids, or it could be a 60-year-old who has seven kids and her daughter died, so she has to take care of her daughter's kids, too," Thomson explained.

Beware great expectationsWritten by James Manor |
Posted: December 2, 2014 2:41 am
Six months after the Lok Sabha election, the BJP’s impressive performance still delights its supporters. This is understandable. For the first time in 30 years, a single party gained a majority. And, at least so far, satisfaction extends beyond the ruling party. Recent opinion polls have given the new government solid approval ratings.
But previous Indian elections suggest that the sheer scale of the BJP’s thumping victory should cause it as much worry as joy. Sweeping triumphs in India generate soaring expectations that are almost impossible to fulfil. Big wins in parliamentary elections in 1971, 1977 and 1984 were all followed by humbling defeats.
In 1971, Indira Gandhi’s “garibi hatao” slogan triggered a landslide, but after delivering little on that very tall promise, she found herself in deep trouble by 1975. She had radically centralised power in an attempt to exercise personal rule. Ironically, however, this weakened her by cutting her off from reliable information from below. Frightened subordinates told her only what they thought she wanted to hear. Her domineering ways also angered many former allies within her party who lost influence. She worried that by stepping aside temporarily in mid-1975, as court judgments required, she might usher in a new leader who would not stand down once her legal problems were resolved. The Emergency that she imposed to save herself alienated most voters and a crushing defeat followed in 1977.
That brought in a Janata government amid high expectations that it would restore democracy. It began to do so. But it contained diverse political forces that soon came into conflict. To manage those internal tensions, the government needed a supremely agile, flexible leader. Instead, it got the brittle Morarji Desai, who gave new meaning to the word rigidity. The inglorious collapse of his government opened the way to yet another embarrassing defeat and Indira Gandhi’s return to power.
After her assassination, Rajiv Gandhi rode a sympathy wave to a brute majority in 1984. Voters expected both continuity and renewal from him. He began by pursuing several fresh ideas: opening up the economy, restoring power and autonomy to government institutions that had been badly battered by his mother’s assertive ways, rebuilding the faction-ridden Congress party, and so on. But within three years, he had proved hopelessly wayward. His U-turns on most of those early policies alienated people on both sides of numerous key issues. He went into the 1989 election stressing the slogan, “We have given you power.” This referred not to his government’s achievements, but to something that it had tried and failed to accomplish but proposed to do in the near future: strengthening panchayati raj. He was humbled in that election.
All three of those governments were poorly led. Narendra Modi may continued…

Exploitation  by lawWritten by Vijay Raghavan |
Posted: December 2, 2014 2:46 am
The recent proposal by the National Commission for Women to legalise prostitution has opened up an old debate. It is a misnomer that legalisation would lead to improving the lives of women in prostitution by way of reduced harassment by the police and provision of healthcare facilities. Advocates of legalisation should first examine the experience of countries where prostitution has been legalised. The mere fact that licensing has been or is being tried out — in countries such as Australia, the Netherlands and Thailand — does not by itself justify the automatic and unthinking transfer of the ideology, policy or law. Women in these countries are increasingly finding that their situation has, in fact, worsened after legalisation.
Legalisation can lead to an unprecedented spurt in the trafficking of women and children for prostitution/ commercial sexual exploitation. Once legalised, it will become extremely difficult for civil society groups and the police to enter premises that have been granted the licence for prostitution, and rescue minors or adult women who may be forcefully kept there against their will.
The presumption that harassment of women in prostitution would stop as a result of legalisation is flawed. The licensing process, renewal, inspection, certification, fines, cancellation of the licence, etc will increase the scope for further exploitation and harassment of women, who will now have to depend on a new set of agents and “pimps” to sustain their lives. It is necessary to distinguish between sympathy and real and tangible assistance. Merely giving licences/ permits does not lead to automatic improvement of the highly negative and, at times, dangerous conditions under which commercialised prostitution functions.
The legalisation position rests on a single premise — women will be issued licences by the state health department to carry on prostitution in a specified area and, in return, will be provided identity cards and minimum health and welfare benefits. Experience has shown that prostitution continues to have no social sanction and, therefore, remains clandestine in nature, even in countries where it has been legalised. In such a situation, women are reluctant to register themselves as “sex workers”, since it means getting identified by government authorities. Also, the issue and renewal of licence is subject to a health clearance, which means being STD- and HIV-free. What will then happen to those who are infected?
The existence of minimum services in terms of healthcare, child welfare, ration cards, etc may provide temporary relief for some women in the trade. However, it may not lead to substantive changes in the long run, when women are eventually forced out of the trade due to illness, old age, unemployability or destitution. Currently, such women are forced to service customers in many undignified ways in continued…

A canyon of disparityPrint

One thing the grand jury decision in Ferguson, Missouri, has sent back to the surface is just how difficult it is to have cross-racial discussions about crime and punishment in this country. That is largely because, perceptually and experientially, we live in vastly different worlds, worlds in which phrases like “bad choices”, “personal responsibility” and “tailspin of culture” must battle for primacy with “structural inequity”, “systemic bias” and “culture of oppression”. Let’s begin to unpack this by pointing to what the data say about our distortions of perception when it comes to crime.
A September report by the Sentencing Project found that “white Americans overestimate the proportion of crime committed by people of colour, and associate people of colour with criminality”. For some crimes, the overestimation was “by 20-30 per cent”. This is particularly significant in light of the fact that Americans overestimate the presence of crime in general. As a Gallup report pointed out recently: “For more than a decade, Gallup has found the majority of Americans believing crime is up, although actual crime statistics have largely shown the crime rate continuing to come down from the highs in the 1990s and earlier.”
If we continue to think that crime is up, data be damned, and we associate people of colour with that crime, of course our concepts of guilt, innocence, veracity and compassion in encounters between police and people of colour will be affected. This is not to say that statistics don’t tell us that crime rates are disproportionately high in minority neighbourhoods, but rather than ascribe that to some racial pathology — and doing so is racist on its face — we must consider the intersection of race and concentrated poverty, which is attended by everything from poorer-performing schools to fewer job opportunities.
And these areas of concentrated poverty are growing, according to a July Brookings report: “As poverty increased and spread during the 2000s, the number of distressed neighbourhoods in the United States — defined as census tracts with poverty rates of 40 per cent or more — climbed by nearly three-quarters.” The report continued: “The population living in such neighbourhoods grew by similar margins (76 per cent, or five million people) to reach 11.6 million by 2008-2012.”
Are people of colour simply choosing to live in high-poverty, high-crime neighbourhoods, or have these residential patterns been imposed by generations of discriminatory housing and employment practices, and been exacerbated by the Great Recession, continued…

Eight out of 10 Americans now believe the climate is changing, according to a new survey conducted for Munich Re America, the world's largest reinsurance firm.
"Our survey findings indicate that national sentiment over whether or not climatic changes are occurring has finally reached a tipping point," said Tony Kuczinski, president of Munich Re America.
The survey's release today coincides with negotiations among more than 190 countries that got underway this month in Lima, Peru, on a long-elusive global climate accord that's supposed to be adopted next year in Paris.
Pledges by Chinese President Xi Jinping and President Obama last month to limit their emissions after 2020 sent a powerful signal that a global deal to limit carbon emissions could be possible next year. Those emissions are creating greenhouse gases that a consensus of 97% of climate scientists hold responsible for warming the planet.
The main survey question — "In your opinion, do you believe that climate change is occurring?" — did not specify whether the changes were due to man-made or natural causes, according to Peter Hoeppe, head of Munich Re's Geo Risks Research.
Hoeppe said that about 60% of people say the climate is changing due to man-made causes.
The results of the survey are based on 1,008 adults surveyed Oct. 9-12 by independent pollsters from ORC International, a market research agency.
The survey found that 71% of respondents believed greater use of alternative energy sources, such as solar or wind power, would be the most effective in the battle against climate change.
"These results are important and compelling," said Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, a group that mobilizes business leadership on climate-change issues. Ceres was not involved in the survey.
Other survey findings:
— Americans in the West (86%) were most confident that climate change is occurring, followed by the Northeast and South (84%), and Midwest (78%).
— 63% are concerned about changes in the frequency and intensity of natural disasters, such as floods, hurricanes and tornadoes.
— Americans are less concerned about climate change (14%) than global political instability (31%), an economic crisis (27%) or a pandemic (22%).
Other recent surveys also suggest some hesitance about attributing climate change to weather: Only 35% of U.S. citizens believed global warming was the main cause of the abnormally high temperatures during the winter of 2012, according to a paper led by Michigan State University sociologist Aaron McCright published in the journal Nature Climate Change last week.
Last month, a Pew survey reported that 48% of Americans rated global climate change as a major threat, less than concerns about the Islamic State militant group (67%), Iran's nuclear program (59%) and North Korea's nuclear program (57%).
In a Pew international survey of 39 countries last year, Americans were among the least concerned about climate change threatening their country.

Of 44 326 students out of school in state  22 551 are children with special needsWritten by Ardhra Nair | Pune |
Posted: December 3, 2014 4:20 am
Even as the world observes International Day of Persons with Disabilities on Wednesday, children with special needs (CWSN) in the state are left to fend for themselves as neither the inclusive education promised to them under the Right to Education Act has become a reality, nor are there enough special educators to cater to them. As a result, of the 1,45,326 students who are out of school in the age group of 6-13 years, a total of 22,551 are children with special needs.
“Disability or poor health is the most common reason for being out of school among CWSN. An estimated 21.39 lakh children (1.05per cent) in the age group of 6-13 years have been identified as CWSN. Among those aged 6-13 years, 5.94 lakh children are out of school. This means 28.23 per cent of the CWSN are out of school. This is much higher than the national estimate of out-of-school children (2.97per cent). An analysis of the out-of-school data by type of disabilities reveals that 44.13 per cent of those suffering from multiple disabilities (more than one type of physical or mental disability or both) are out of school. Out of the total children suffering from any mental disability, 35.97 per cent children are out of school, 34.82 per cent of those suffering from speech disability are not going to any school,” says the National Survey on Estimation of Out of School Children on the official website of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan.
The Maharashtra education department had prepared a report proposing inclusive education for children even in secondary classes.
“Before the RTE Act came into effect in 2009, there were special educators. But the RTE Act propagates inclusive education. Hence, instead of earlier secluding the CWSN and then teaching them, we now have CWSN being taught in regular classes,” said S Chockalingam, Commissioner of Education, Maharashtra.
“But when these students move into secondary classes after Class VIII, they come under the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan which says there should be one special educator for every five CWSN. Hence, this again becomes segregation of students, which is not what the RTE Act intends to do, thus failing the entire aim of inclusive education. Hence, we proposed to have a similar teaching method to Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan even in secondary classes where students with special needs can sit together with regular students and study,” said Mahavir Mane, Director, Primary Education.
However, the state that talks about inclusive education and giving special training to regular teachers to make them equipped to teach CWSN has till date no such training conducted by the State Council of Educational Training and Research. When asked, Deputy Director Shakuntala Kale said: “We have not done any training programmes yet but we will be doing it from next year.”
The survey further says 25.12 per cent of the total estimated CWSN suffer from orthopaedic disability, 19.59 per cent from visual disability, 16.95 per cent from speech disability and 14.57 per cent from mental disability. “An estimated 11.81 per cent children among CWSN suffer from continued…

Russia Is Returning to Soviet Military Strategyreddit
French President Francois Hollande has essentially vetoed the transfer of the first Mistral helicopter carrier to Russia. The Elysee Palace announced that Moscow's actions in Ukraine do not create the necessary conditions for the transfer of the warship. In response, Russian officials threatened to appeal to international arbitration and sue France for 3 billion euros -- against the purchase price of 1.2 billion euros for two Mistral carriers -- and several State Duma deputies have called for a ban on imports of French wine.
The situation has obviously reached an impasse. The Kremlin shows no intention of budging on its Ukraine policy and the French authorities worried that they might ultimately see their Mistral ship landing Russian troops on Ukraine's Black Sea coast. The Mistral deal seems to have run aground for the foreseeable future.
In an attempt to put a good face on a bad situation, the Defense Ministry hurried to declare that the warships were not all that necessary anyway. If that is true, why did Russia agree three years ago to put up so much money for them? I think the Mistral deal symbolized the attempt to establish military cooperation between Russia and the West, and France's refusal to transfer an already completed ship indicates the failure of that attempt.
Then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin made the initial decision for political reasons. First, he wanted to express his gratitude to then-French President Nicolas Sarkozy for helping Moscow overcome its international isolation following the Russia-Georgia War of 2008.
Second, Moscow discovered during that war that its weaponry had become hopelessly obsolete. According to reports, the marines of Russia's Black Sea Fleet received orders to make a landing in Abkhazia and began loading the landing craft on board. However, technical problems caused the loading process to drag on for five days -- that is, over the entire length of the war. Obviously, a landing craft built 30 years ago is practically useless for short, intense local conflicts.
Then-Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov, who clashed openly with defense industry officials, had his own reasons for the deal. His deputy stated very frankly that the Defense Ministry had no intention of financing ineffective defense industry products. The Mistral purchase was to have been a signal to the defense industry that effectively said: "Either you produce what the Defense Ministry needs, or we will purchase our weapons abroad."
But the most important thing in my opinion is that the Mistral represents a new philosophy for Russia's naval military policy. Russia inherited its entire fleet from the Soviet Union, and that surface fleet was built for one main objective: to protect and support the operations of submarines so that, in the event of hostilities, those subs could fire their missiles at the United States before being destroyed. Today's Russian fleet carries out the same task.
However, the Mistral is built for the fundamentally different naval objectives of carrying out anti-terrorist and anti-pirate operations and evacuating Russian citizens from states convulsed by internal conflicts -- in short, for all operations related to the so-called "projection of force." Russian admirals did not welcome changing the combat mission of the fleet and therefore opposed the Mistral. Shipbuilders were even more upset about the deal because they knew they lacked the capability to produce a comparable vessel.
Thus, Russian admirals and defense industry firms stand to benefit the most from France's refusal to deliver the Mistral warships and from Russia's return to a Soviet-style closed economy. That means the Russian armed forces will receive only the military equipment the domestic defense industry is capable of producing -- whether they need it or not.
With oil prices falling, corrupt officials see defense spending as their last opportunity to pocket government funds -- and they have no intention of sharing that windfall with foreign defense industry competitors. Putin's recently announced policy of substituting Russian goods for previously imported products will enable those senior officials to siphon off a significant portion of budgetary funds while blaming the failure of the government's plan to modernize the military on the insidious machinations of the West. That is what seems to be happening during the endless series of meetings Putin holds with Russia's defense industry leaders.
Russia's plans to project its force to distant locations with the help of the Mistral warship turn out to be unnecessary now that Moscow is rapidly spiraling downward into a confrontation with the West. The Russian navy can again focus on the former tasks of attacking a potential enemy's aircraft carrier groups and protecting nuclear submarines long enough to launch their missiles. That means the admirals do not need any additional training and that Russia's 30- to 40-year-old weapons will suffice for the current Cold War.

Central banks will stay easy in 2015  because they have no choiceCentral banks will stay easy in 2015, because they have no choice
Bloomberg Dec 3, 2014, 03.30AM IST
Tags:
Euro zone
(More than six years after…)
The world's central bankers could be forgiven for thinking that things are never going to get back to normal. More than six years after the financial crisis plunged the world into recession, monetary policy looks nothing like it did before those events.
Even as economists predict that the US Federal Reserve and Bank of England will finally begin to raise benchmark rates in 2015, the central banks are unlikely to push borrowing costs anywhere near pre-crisis, inflation-fighting levels. And even though the Fed in October ended the bond-buying campaign it undertook when the US economy was weaker, it isn't shedding the assets it bought. The European Central Bank and Bank of Japan, for their part, are stepping up purchases. "Given the slow and unsteady nature of the recovery, supportive policy remains necessary," Fed Chair Janet Yellen said at a conference in Paris especially as fiscal policy today remains "somewhat contractionary."
FISCAL CONSTRAINTS
In the US, more government spending to stimulate growth isn't in the cards, especially after Republicans won full control of Congress in November's election. In the euro zone, governments can back away from austerity only slightly before they run up against European Union rules and German opposition. In Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's fiscal stimulus plan has been blunted by a consumption tax increase that went into effect in April.
The International Monetary Fund in October forecast that the global economy will expand 3.8 per cent in 2015, up from an estimated 3.3 per cent for 2014 but below the boom years of 2004 to 2007.
'IMPOSSIBLE TASK'
"To be a central banker is an impossible task," says Thomas Mayer, the former chief economist at Deutsche Bank AG who now runs a think tank for German wealth manager Flossbach von Storch AG in Cologne. He compares the actions of central bankers since 2008 to that of US generals in the Iraq War: They started with shock and awe and won the initial battles, but they ran into trouble when it came time to withdraw.
DOVISH BENT
Bank economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect 2015 will be the year in which the Fed raises its benchmark federal funds rate after six years near zero, with the first increase coming in the second half. They predict the Fed won't raise its benchmark in 2015 and that the Bank of England will wait for the final quarter to do so.
"Lowflation is the new enemy as it harms debtors, reduces the scope for negative real interest rates and damages central bank credibility," Joachim Fels, Morgan Stanley's chief international economist, said in a report to clients this week.
A dovish bent in global monetary policy, however necessary, means savers who want their money in low-risk investments such as bonds or bank deposits will continue to get paltry payouts -- as they have in the entire post-crisis era.
  HEAVY DEBT
There's a reason for central bankers to go slow on rate hikes: The world is swimming in debt. The level of debt in the global economy, excluding financial companies, is up by more than a third since 2008, according to a September report by the International Center for Monetary and Banking Studies in Geneva. The report concludes that the potential global growth rate has dropped to less than 3 per cent from about 4.5 per cent prior to 2008.
Central bank balance sheets aren't going back to normal any more than rates are. After three rounds of quantitative easing in the US, the Fed held a record $4.5 trillion of assets on its balance sheet at the end of October, up from less than $1 trillion in 2007. The BOJ and ECB, of course, are still adding assets.
RELIANT MARKETS
Stock markets have become reliant on monetary support, says Matt King, global head of credit strategy at Citigroup Inc. He estimates that central banks need to pump about $200 billion into the global economy every quarter to keep stocks from falling -- and that no net monetary stimulus would cause a 10 per cent quarterly drop. The sudden sell-off in October was a reaction to the withdrawal of central bank support, which was as high as $1 trillion per quarter in 2012, King says, and the rebound was spurred by expectations that the BOJ and ECB would do more -- which they did.
As the bankers search for the right levers to promote growth, it's all for naught unless they prevent the credit excesses and overhyped markets that threw the financial system into turmoil in 2007 and 2008.
BUBBLE RISK
Cognizant of the hazards of raising rates, Yellen, Carney and other monetary leaders are betting that vigilance against bubbles will allow them more scope to stimulate the fragile, debt-laden economy. Spotting bubbles, soothing markets, keeping a fragile global economy growing -- there's nothing normal about what central bankers are being asked to do. Stephen King, chief economist at HSBC Holdings Plc, frets that they're being asked too much. "With conflicting objectives, they're always going to fail in one, and that will only put them under greater political scrutiny," King says.

US President Barack Obama s trip a defining & exciting time in Indo-US relationsBarack Obama
(Obama's trip will build…)
WASHINGTON: President Barack Obama's visit to India will build on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's highly successful trip here, nominee for US Ambassador to India Richard Rahul Verma has said, describing it as a "defining and exciting" time in the re-energised Indo-US ties.
"There is no question that this is a defining and exciting time in the US-India relationship. President Obama will make a historic visit to India in January, becoming the first US head of state to attend India's Republic Day and the only sitting US president to visit India twice," Verma told members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday during his confirmation hearing.
Obama's trip will build on Prime Minister Modi's highly successful visit to the United States in September, he said.
"There's little doubt the relationship has been re-energised, with renewed enthusiasm to take our partnership to the next level," said Verma.
Verma, 45, if confirmed, would be the first ever Indian- American to be the top US diplomat in New Delhi.
He would replace Nancy Powell, who resigned from her position early this year.
Verma said America's strategic partnership with India is rooted in their shared democratic values and in the joint vision of a peaceful, just and prosperous world.
"From expanding trade and defence relationships, to ensuring maritime security and freedom of navigation, from countering terrorist networks to promoting clean energy and sustainable development the US and India share a wide-range of critical national interests. Our partnership is deep, it touches nearly every endeavour of human pursuit, and it has produced important gains for each of our countries," he said.
Referring to the growing co-operation between India and the US in various field including trade and defence, Verma said the ripple effects of our partnership need not be limited to Asia.
"As Prime Minister Modi noted, the true power and potential in this relationship is that when the oldest and largest democracies come together, the world will benefit," he said.
Verma said despite differences and some frustrating moments the trend line in the bilateral partnership is very strong.
"The relationship that we seek with India is really anchored in our values and our interests --largest democracy and oldest democracy," he said.
"Our strategic impact can be felt not only in South Asia but also now in East Asia, as we do have a convergence of interests, and that is, we have to articulate a vision...I think we have to think much broader than a transactional relationship. Think about the strategic partnership that we both can have and can achieve," he said.
"That's the vision statement. We have to operationalise that and we can operationalise that through our defence relationship, through economics and trade, through energy and climate. There are a lot of different ways. And the richness of this partnership is really unlimited," Verma said in response to a question from Senator Robert Menendez, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Verma acknowledged that the US also has challenges which come from India's history, a very proud history of non-alignment.
"Sometimes we get frustrated when they don't join us in international campaigns or on international efforts more publicly. But I would say that the trend line in our partnership is very strong and that we have to view it over a period of time and that we have to do the hard work that our bureaucracies are doing," he said.
  "The fact that the two leaders of both countries came together and articulated a very strong strategic vision statement for both countries I think really bodes well for the relationship. And I do think the time is now to build upon that," he said.
Responding to questions, Verma said the recent India-US agreement on trade facilitation agreement of the WTO is a good news.
"I think in recent weeks there's a good-news story on the trade side," he said.
"I think certainly health access and delivery of pharmaceuticals has been a contentious issue over the past few years. If we can talk about those issues in a way where we can bring our best practices together with some of the needs of India in delivering pharmaceuticals and delivering health and medicine, those are the kinds of discussions that can get us past some of the thorny issues," he said.
"Trade with India has increased five times in the last 10 years. We can do much more if we can work together on some of these market access issues and on some of the trade issues, which are vitally important," the Ambassadorial nominee said.

Mumbai, Dec 2 (IANS) Former union minister and Maharashtra's first Muslim chief minister A.R. Antulay died Tuesday following prolonged illness, his nephew said. He was 85.
Antulay breathed his last at Mumbai's Breach Candy Hospital where he had been admitted a few days ago.
He is survived by his wife Nargis, son Naved and daughters Neelam, Shabnam and Mubina, said nephew and son-in-law Mushtaque Antulay.
Known as 'Barrister Antulay', he was the state's first Muslim chief minister from June 1980-Jan 1982. He was appointed by late prime minister Indira Gandhi.
He served as a union minister in 1995 and later in the UPA-I government of former prime minister Manmohan Singh.
"As per traditions, we perform the funeral in our native place. We are likely to hold the funeral ceremonies Wednesday in his village of birth at Ambet, Raigad district," Mushtaque Antulay told IANS.

President Obama  meet your 3-D printed counterpartThe Smithsonian took a 3D portrait of President Obama, creating the highest resolution digital model of a head of state. (The White House)
This post has been updated.
The presidential portrait just got a 21st century makeover.
A team of digital imaging specialists led by the Smithsonian Institute have and assisted by others, created a 3-D portrait of President Obama -- a high-resolution, digital representation of his measurements, contours and likeness -- and filmed the process.
The project was inspired by a decidedly old-school technique: a life mask, where a person's face was covered in plaster to form a mold. That's how Abraham Lincoln's, which is displayed in the National Portrait Gallery, was created.
Obama's process was a bit less messy. He sat in a chair, surrounded by 50 custom-built LED lights, 8 sports photography cameras and six wide-angle cameras, which took a swarm of photos and simulated different lighting conditions. Technicians then walked around Obama with devices called "structured 3-D light scanners," which captured three-dimensional images.
The images were then 3-D printed, creating a bust of Obama that kind of looks like an avatar -- and makes for a decidedly meta moment: the president walking around the creation, checking himself out.

British MPs urge tougher line on Hong Kong

(Cameron's government says…)
LONDON: British MPs urged the government to take a tougher line with China in an emergency House of Commons debate today after a group of them was refused visas to visit Hong Kong.
Members of the Foreign Affairs Committee were declined visas to visit Hong Kong later this month by Chinese authorities who accused the former colonial power of seeking to interfere in pro-democracy protests.
While Prime Minister David Cameron's government says the situation can be smoothed over with talks, it has caused outrage among lawmakers who want ministers to take a firmer stance.
The refusal complicates British efforts to reset relations with China that were plunged into difficulties after Cameron met the Dalai Lama at Downing Street in 2012.
During the rare debate, Hugo Swire, a Foreign Office minister, called China's ban "wholly unjustified" but stressed the need to "pursue dialogue in issues even when we disagree".
"We have an indispensable relationship with China," he told the Commons. "It's important that this relationship is based on mutual understanding and respect."
Cameron's official spokesman also downplayed fears that the ban could affect trade between Britain and China. British exports to China were worth an average 1 billion pounds (1.2 billion euros, USD 1.5 billion) a month in 2013.
"Where we have differences... we discuss those types of issues alongside and as part of the full range of bilateral relations," he said.
But members of the committee speaking in the debate said the government was not going far enough.
Andrew Rosindell, a member of Cameron's Conservative party, urged that the Chinese ambassador be summoned to the Foreign Office to explain what had happened.
He described the visa ban as "shameful" and "nothing short of an outrage".
"Britain has to decide whether we tolerate and simply accept China's behaviour... or whether we're prepared to reconsider" the nature of the relationship, Rosindell added.
Another Conservative, John Stanley, said he was "very disappointed" that the British foreign ministry had not made a stronger protest, while senior Labour lawmaker Keith Vaz insisted on the need for a "very clear response" from the ministry.
Mass pro-democracy demonstrations have been taking place in Hong Kong since September.
The original founders of the Occupy movement today said they were set to "surrender" but it is thought unlikely that the students who make up the bulk of the protestors will listen to their call for a retreat.

Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: India today joined the elite group of countries including USA, China and Japan to build the largest telescope in the world.
The next-generation 30-meter telescope, which is being built at Mount Mauna Kea on an island in Hawaii at a height of 4,050 meter (half the size of Himalayas), is expected to give a major boost to the field of astrophysics and understanding different facets of the Universe.
The agreement was signed at a function held here late this evening in the presence of Union Science and Technology Minister and senior officials of the Department of Science and Technology and Atomic Energy and representatives of the Embassies of China, USA and Japan.
Canada is the fifth country which is expected to sign the agreement soon.
On its part, India will contribute 30 per cent of the amount to the total pool of constructing infrastructure facilities like the access road and buildings while 70 percent will be used in providing high quality sensors and actuators.
Of the Rs 1,300 crore, which India intends to contribute for the project, the S&T will contribute 52 per cent while the DAE will shell out the remaining 48 per cent.

(A state-of-the-art 750…)
RIO DE JANEIRO: British auto firm Jaguar Land Rover said Tuesday it has started building its first fully-owned factory outside the United Kingdom in the Brazilian town of Itatiaia, near Rio de Janeiro.
A state-of-the-art 750 million reais ($290 million) complex will also house an education and business center, the British firm said in a statement.
The plant will employ 400 workers for production capacity of 24,000 vehicles as Jaguar becomes the first British auto company to invest in a manufacturing plant in Brazil.
"Our new facility in Brazil is an important strand of Jaguar Land Rover's long-term sustainability," said CEO Dr Ralf Speth, after the foundation stone was laid.
"The start of construction is a significant milestone and represents another step forward in our plans to create a truly global manufacturing footprint," said Speth.
He explained the company, owned by Indian giant Tata Motors , aimed to produce "vehicles that our customers in Brazil can love for life."
The first vehicles are slated to roll off the production line in 2016. Speth said the educational center "demonstrates our commitment to developing the skills needed by tomorrow's workforce to develop a sustainable premium automative manufacturing industry in Brazil."
Jaguar, which says it hopes to create a close relationship with the local community, intends to source many parts from Brazil but will also resort in part to its global supply chain.
Rio state governor Luiz Fernando Pezao said the breaking of ground at the future plant was "an historic achievement for the state of Rio" and said the state was honored to receive the education center, the first of its kind in Latin America.
He added that the Rio region offered "perfect conditions" for would-be investors.
As well as building the center, Jaguar Land Rover recently launched the opening phase of a program just outside Itatiaia designed to "inspire the workers of tomorrow, offering auto sector work experience for 17-to 26-year-olds.
One vehicle Jaguar plans to produce at the new plant is the Discovery Sport, well received at the recent Sao Paulo Motor Show.
The company, whose Range Rover models are already popular in Brazil, identified as a major market by the premium brand constructor, says it is already recruiting personnel in conjunction with municipal authorities.
The company has had a sales presence in Brazil for more than 20 years and by the middle of next year hopes to have 42 dealerships in the giant South American country.
The company's move into Brazil follows the recent establishment of a joint venture in China as it extends its global reach.
Jaguar also has an assembly plant in Pune, India, while in October it unveiled its first overseas manufacturing unit in partnership with China's Chery Automobile Company Ltd at Changshu north of Shanghai.

Ukraine parliament approves new government

(The Cabinet approved by…)
KIEV: Ukraine's Parliament approved the formation of a new government Tuesday, bringing an end to weeks of behind-the-scenes political wrangling following an October election that ushered in a group of ardently pro-Western parties.
The Cabinet approved by lawmakers will be headed Arseniy Yatsenyuk, 40, who has served as prime minister since February.
Five political blocs, including Yatsenyuk's Popular Front party, last month formed a parliamentary coalition that has vowed to enact an agenda of drastic economic and political reform.
``We are prepared for the most radical and toughest changes in this country. This mission will be completed,'' Yatsenyuk said in a speech in parliament before the vote on the Cabinet.
Yatsenyuk said social assistance spending had been reduced by $300 million this year and that the trend was set to continue.
Tasks to be completed by the incoming government before year's end include brining in laws to give more budget-raising powers to local authorities and reducing the number of taxes, Yatsenyuk said.
Ministers in the new Cabinet include several figures who received Ukrainian citizenship by presidential decree earlier Tuesday. One is Finance Minister Natalie Jaresko, a U.S. national with experience working for the U.S. State Department in Washington.
Many of the ministers in the Cabinet retain posts they have held for several months. Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin and Defense Minister Stepan Poltorak, who were nominated by President Petro Poroshenko, were overwhelming reconfirmed to their jobs by parliament.
The incoming government comes into force on a program to radically overhaul government, slash corruption and re-orient Ukraine toward Europe. Poroshenko and Yatsenyuk have both said they eventually want to see Ukraine join the European Union and NATO .
Work on kick-starting the country's shrinking economy has been set back to date, however, by months of bitter fighting in the east between government forces and Russian-backed separatist rebels.

(Twitter announced on Tuesday…)
NEW YORK: Twitter announced on Tuesday improvements to simplify the way users report abuse and harassment on the social media platform .
The company said it will now require less information from users flagging inappropriate content and that it will be easier to submit tweets and accounts for review, even when wrongful behaviour is simply observed and not received directly.
"We are nowhere near being done making changes in this area," Shreyas Doshi , director of product management and user safety said in a message posted on Twitter's website.
"In the coming months, you can expect to see additional user controls, further improvements to reporting and new enforcement procedures for abusive accounts."
Users also will be able to view all the accounts they have blocked in a new blocked accounts page accessible from the settings menu on Twitter.
The changes, which will be rolled out to all users in the next few weeks, include modifications designed to speed up Twitter's response by better streamlining and prioritising reports of abusive content, technology news website The Verge reported.
A way to block multiple accounts at once also appears to be in the works, according to The Verge.
Twitter has faced criticism in the past over a response to harassment and abuse deemed too lax by many of its users.
In December last year, the company was forced to nix a change to its "block" feature under criticism that the new policy still allowed blocked users to interact with those who had blocked them..
Earlier this year, a survey by online advocacy groups found that nearly half of Americans under the age of 35 have been bullied, harassed or threatened online.
Twenty-four percent of the people surveyed said the harassment happened on Twitter.

Rattled by Chinese submarines  India joins other nations in rebuilding fleetRattled by Chinese submarines, India joins other nations in rebuilding fleet

(India is speeding up a navy…)
NEW DELHI: India is speeding up a navy modernisation programme and leaning on its neighbours to curb Chinese submarine activity in the Indian Ocean, as nations in the region become increasingly jittery over Beijing's growing undersea prowess.
Just months after a stand-off along the disputed border dividing India and China in the Himalayas, Chinese submarines have shown up in Sri Lanka, the island nation off India's southern coast. China has also strengthened ties with the Maldives.
China's moves reflect its determination to beef up its presence in the Indian Ocean, through which four-fifths of its oil imports pass, and coincides with escalating tension in the disputed South China Sea, where Beijing's naval superiority has rattled its neighbours.
"We should be worried the way we have run down our submarine fleet. But with China bearing down on us, the way it is on the Himalayas, the South China Sea and now the Indian Ocean, we should be even more worried," said Arun Prakash, former chief of the navy.
"Fortunately, there are signs this government has woken up to the crisis," he said. "But it will take time to rebuild. We should hope that we don't get into a face-off with the Chinese, that our diplomacy and alliances will keep things in check."
Modi government has ordered an accelerated tendering process to build six conventional diesel-electric submarines at an estimated cost of Rs 50,000 crore ($8.1 billion), in addition to six similar submarines that French firm DCNS is assembling in Mumbai port to replace a nearly 30-year-old fleet hit by a run of accidents.
The country's first indigenously built nuclear submarine - loaded with nuclear-tipped missiles and headed for sea trials this month - joins the fleet in late 2016. India leased a nuclear-propelled submarine from Russia in 2012 and is in talks to lease a second one, navy officials told Reuters.
The government has already turned to industrial group Larsen & Toubro Ltd, which built the hull for the first domestic nuclear submarine, to manufacture two more, sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Elsewhere in the region, Australia is planning to buy up to 12 stealth submarines from Japan, while Vietnam plans to acquire as many as four additional Kilo-class submarines to add to its current fleet of two. Taiwan is seeking US technology to build up its own submarine fleet.
Japan, locked in a dispute with China over islands claimed by both nations, is increasing its fleet of diesel-electric attack submarines to 22 from 16 over the next decade or so.
OUTNUMBERED
In addition to the leased Russian nuclear-propelled submarine, India's navy currently has 13 ageing diesel-electric submarines, only half of which are operational at any given time due to refits. Last year, one of its submarines sank after explosions and a fire while it was docked in Mumbai.
China is estimated to have 60 conventional submarines and 10 nuclear-powered submarines, including three armed with nuclear weapons.
Ma Jiali, an expert at the China Reform Forum's Centre for Strategic Studies which is affiliated with the Central Party School, said Beijing's top concern in the Indian Ocean was safeguarding the passage of its commodities, especially oil.
"There are many voices in India who believe the Indian Ocean belongs solely to India, and no other country belongs there. That line of thought is common - but of course it shouldn't be viewed like that. Our (China's) view is that there should be dialogue and discussion between China and India."
  With India building its navy to about 150 ships, including two aircraft carriers, and China holding around 800 in its naval fleet, the two are more likely than not to run into each other, naval officials and experts say.
David Brewster, a strategic affairs visiting fellow at the Australian National University, said India will do everything it can to recover its dominant position in the Indian Ocean.
It may seek naval cooperation with Japan and Australia, and expand a military base on the Andaman Islands which lie about 140 km (87 miles) from the Malacca Straits, he said.
"India sees the presence of any Chinese naval vessel as an intrusion. There is a big ramp-up in their presence, which is clearly intended to send a message to India," said Brewster.
India has engaged in intense diplomacy with Sri Lanka about the Chinese submarine presence, reminding it that New Delhi must be informed of such port calls under a maritime pact they signed this year along with the Maldives.
India has also muscled into an $8 billion deep water port that Bangladesh wants to develop in Sonadia in the Bay of Bengal, with the Adani Group submitting a proposal in October. China Harbour Engineering Company, an early bidder, was the front-runner.
"If China continues down this path and continues with this level of presence in the Indian Ocean then the Indians will feel they need to respond," said Brewster.

Ahead of hearing  MC acts against illegal hoardingsWritten by Divya Goyal 2 | Ludhiana |
Posted: December 3, 2014 5:47 am
The Municipal Corporation cracked the whip on nearly 400 illegal hoardings in the city on Tuesday,  in accordance with orders of the Punjab and Haryana High Court.
On Tuesday, hoardings were removed from Pakhowal road, Chandigarh road, Hambran road, Mall road and Ferozepur road. While a separate policy for malls, shops and religious hoardings has been drawn up, a policy for hoardings put up by political parties is yet to be finalised.
The high court, on November 21, has asked the MC to prepare a status report and submit it on December 5. It was after this that the civic body initiated action against illegal hoardings and issued a public notice to all shopkeepers and commercial establishments to remove hoardings within two days.
“It is made clear to MC Ludhiana that in case illegal hoardings and outdoor advertisements are not removed by next date of hearing, a court commissioner would be appointed to inspect city and in case the report reveals infractions, the officer(s) would be held responsible,” the court order read.
Talking to Newsline, an official from the MC’s tehbazaari wing said, “The high court has asked for complete report on December 5. It has been the MC’s policy to take action only when HC hearing is near, making the situation tough. But a policy for political hoardings is yet to be finalized as there is a lot of political pressure.”
Sources said that “as per orders of Deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal, not a single hoarding with his photo should be visible in the city. This has further put the MC in a tight spot as local leaders have installed his photos at various spots and are pressurising officials not to act against them.”
Tehbazaari superintendent J S Sekhon told Newsline, “As per bylaws, shopkeepers cannot install a board measuring more than 3 feet in width for advertising. Surrogate advertising is banned and one cannot install boards of any other brand. For malls, building wrap is allowed and for religious ads, 21 sites allowing two boards each are finalized. The MC will submit a status report before the court on December 5.”
Asked about political hoardings, he said, “A policy is yet to be finalised for political ads.”

Parking problems on the rise  proposals for solutions gather dustWritten by Khushboo Sandhu | Chandigarh |
Posted: December 3, 2014 4:48 am
Finding a space to park in the city is becoming difficult as the number of vehicles is increasing. Proposals made over the years to ease the situation have remained confined to paper.
In residential areas, big kanal houses have parking spaces, but the same is not true of marla houses. Families on each floor own vehicles and park along the roads. The situation is such that early in the morning and during the evening, vehicles cannot pass in case of emergency.
It other areas, the contractors charge a fee for entering the parking lot. The vehicle owners are on their own after this with no parking attendants for help. As a result, vehicles more than the capacity of the parking lot enter and lead to haphazard slotting.
Ever since the paid parking system was introduced a decade back, the parking fee has remained Rs 5 for four-wheelers and Rs 2 for two wheelers. With the municipal corporation’s revenue from auctions increasing, the margin of contractors is shrinking.
As many as seven of the 23 paid parking lots are without contractors, who say the MC charges them service tax with retrospective effect. Further, they have not been paid fee for city passes that number around 20 lakh. These factors, in fact, have led to the auctions failing twice.
Further, each parking lot is supposed to have a fire zone. But even where these are marked, they are occupied by vehicles. There have been instances when fire tenders could reach a fire only after vehicles were lifted and put aside.
Proposed solutions prove insufficient
The underground parking lots in sectors 17 and 8 are not being utilised because of the lack of lights and security. Also, since parking fee is charged only for surface parking, the contractors do not encourage the use of these parking lots.
A few market welfare associations, which were given charge of the parking lots, have given up. Though a multi-level parking lot is being constructed in Sector 17, those proposed for sectors 43, 34 and 8 are yet to be planned.
Underground parking lots were suggested under every park, but the idea was not found to be feasible.  A community parking lot did come up in Sector 19 on land that was vacant within the residential area, but the same was never replicated in other sectors.
In several other sectors, the width of parks was reduced to provide space for parking. But this was not enough. A proposal was also put forth to create parking space by removing the boundary wall of marla houses, but this too awaits implementation.
Baljinder Singh Bittu, chairman of the Federation of Sectors Welfare Association Chandigarh, said, “People have encroached upon area outside their houses. These need to be removed to make space. Everyone wants to park continued…

Crocodile rescued in Vadodara villageBy: Express News Service | Vadodara |
Posted: December 3, 2014 4:42 am
A 9.5-foot-long crocodile was rescued from Aniran village near Jarod in Vadodara district after panicked villagers found it slithering on a road in the village.
“It is possible that the crocodile might have migrated all the way from Ajwa lake, which is around 25 kms from the village. Another probability is that it might have come out of the main canal passing along the village and walked all the way inside the village,” said Snehal Bhatt of wildlife NGO, GSPCA.
Ajwa lake is home to hundreds of crocodiles which sometimes come out of their habitat and migrate to far off places in search of food, Bhatt, a wildlife expert said. Naramda canal carries water from Narmada river which also has sizeable population of crocodiles. The reservoir of the Narmada dam at Kevadia in Narmada district is where a majority of crocodiles rescued in Vadodara are released.
“It is hard for crocodiles released into the reservoir to adjust to a new environment and live among other crocodiles. Increasing number also cause food shortage which forces them to migrate,” Bhatt said.
This is one of the largest crocodiles rescued during this season, even as incidents of crocodiles being spotted among human habitat continue to be reported in and around Vadodara. A 15-foot-long crocodile remains the longest for the current season, while total number of crocodiles rescued this season may number over two dozens, wildlife rescuers said.

Hirabhai meets CM over Kolis share in CabinetWritten by Tanvir A Siddiqui | Ahmedabad |

Gujarat Koli Sena leader and Rajula MLA Hirabhai Solanki met Chief Minister Anandiben Patel at her office in Gandhinagar on Tuesday afternoon to discuss issues concerning the community and the reported unrest among its leaders over representation in the state Cabinet.
About 20 prominent Koli community leaders also accompanied Solanki in the meeting that went on for half an hour.
“The meeting was held in a cordial atmosphere. The CM told us to wait for some more time in view of BJP Sangathan Parva (membership drive),” Solanki told The Indian Express after the meeting.
He said that he and his associates were satisfied with the government response. “Shanti rakho (have patience) was what the CM advised our leaders about a way out to resolve our grievances and promised to do the needful after the completion of the ongoing Sangathan Parva in the state,” he said.
The leaders who were present at the meeting with the CM included Leelabhai Dhaki, Babu Talsaniya, Haribhai Chaudhry, Rajabhai Chavda, Ramesh Makwana, Bhagwanbhai Dabhi, Rajdeep Jambucha, among others.
Solanki has been vocal since the Cabinet expansion by the CM on November 18 stating that the Koli community was not given due representation in the government despite its sizeable presence and political influence in the state.
However, his elder brother, Parshottam Solanki, did not agree with him in public, nor did he complain about being given a junior rank in the Cabinet. But younger brother Hirabhai continued with his rebellious views and went ahead with plan to hold a community convention at Bagodara on November 23 against the wishes of elder brother.

Foodie  racing enthusiast and movie buff who detested cheap comedyWritten by Garima Rakesh Mishra | Pune |

Veteran Hindi film and television actor Deven Verma passed away at the Sahyadri Hospital here in the early hours of Tuesday following a cardiac arrest and kidney failure. He was 77. Family members said Verma had been unwell for the last one-and-a-half years.
“Tell him I will always love him, he will be the only one for me,” cried the actor’s wife Rupa Ganguly, daughter of legendary actor the late Ashok Kumar, as relatives carried his body into an ambulance to be taken to the crematorium in Yerawada for funeral. Verma was cremated around noon.
Brother-in-law Arup Kumar said Verma had diabetes for the last 35 years. “He had been told a long time ago about the blockages in his heart and had been recommended a bypass surgery, which he refused. On Monday evening, he started getting restless and was rushed to hospital,” said his niece Jyotika Karve. He died at 2 am.
Manish Kumar, General Manager (Operations) at the Sahyadri Hospital, said the actor was brought in with complaints of dizziness and reduced urine output. He had low blood pressure and was admitted to the ICU at 8 pm. He died of “malignant ventricular arrhythmias”.
Though his last rites were performed in the absence of any big names from Bollywood, apart from actor and relative Anuradha Patel, family members said friends from the industry had been calling since morning. A memorial service is expected by the end of this week at the lawns of Kalyani Nagar’s Pushpak Society where he lived.
Born on October 23, 1937, in Mumbai, Verma’s family moved to Pune while he was in his pre-teens. He studied in a school in Panchgani and later graduated in politics and sociology from Nowrosjee Wadia College before moving to Mumbai to study law. He dropped out after getting roles in movies. “During a felicitation function in 2012, Verma said Wadia college gave him his first lessons in drama when he started participating in college drama festivals,” said V P Bonde, former principal of the college.
Verma worked in nearly 150 films and is best known for his award-winning comic performances in Chori Mera Kaam, Golmaal, Angoor and Chor Ke Ghar Chor among others. His last Hindi film was Calcutta Mail (2003). He had acted in many regional movies too and turned producer with Yakeen in 1969. He  also directed a film in the 1970s.
Family members said Verma spoke many languages. A foodie, the actor loved horses too and never missed any race at the Turf Club. The film buff had a special room on the first floor of his posh Kalyani Nagar bungalow only for watching movies. “A man of principles, he detested cheap comedy”, said a family member.

2010-12: Over 4000 died on shop floor but thats fraction of totalWritten by Anil Sasi | New Delhi |

At around 2.30 pm on October 21, three days before this Diwali, a blast at the Manikanta Fireworks manufacturing unit in the coastal village of Vakathippa near Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh left behind a trail of destruction and 17 bodies. The intensity of the blast at the tiled manufacturing unit was such that the bodies of the victims — 14 of them young women who earned Rs 150 per day — were found strewn nearly 30 metres away in an adjoining rice field.
Four years ago, S Ambiga, a line operator at the Nokia factory in Tamil Nadu’s Sriperumbudur – one of the most modern assembling units in the country – succumbed to her injuries in a hospital after being hit by the arm of an automatic loader machine while reportedly trying to retrieve an electronic chip board on the evening of October 31.
In the first case, chances are that the 17 who lost their lives will not even figure in the official statistics on industrial fatalities as the firecracker manufacturing is bracketed in the informal sector and the Kakinada unit was operating on an expired licence.
In the second, Ambiga was one of the 75 fatalities in 2010 from Tamil Nadu, a state that is among half a dozen others that have seen high accidental fatalities in industrial units, according to data from 2010 to 2012 collected by the Labour Ministry’s Directorate General, Factory Advice Service and Labour Institutes (DGFASLI) from the Chief Inspector of factories of states and union territories.
At Sriperumbudur, the accident happened at about 6.50 pm and Ambiga remained trapped till 7.15 pm, according to testimonies that the factory workers furnished to an inquiry committee. While the Nokia management said that the company investigated the circumstances that led to the accident “as per factory norms and guidelines”, neither the company’s report nor the official inquiry report, prepared by the then Labour Commissioner Hans Raj Varma and submitted to the state government, have been made public. The Nokia India spokesperson did not respond to an email sent on Monday by The Indian Express with a query on the accident.
In statistical terms, a clear trend is that apart from Tamil Nadu, states such as Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Kerala, Punjab and Maharashtra are among those that have either witnessed a steady increase in industrial fatalities or seen high numbers during the last three years for which official data is available.
In absolute terms, the fatalities are the highest in industrialised states such as Gujarat and Maharashtra, as also in resource-rich states such as Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, where mining is a major industrial activity. But the official statistics are updated only till 2012.
But clearly, there are more deaths occurring in the interiors of India’s industrial landscape that do not get documented. Official statistics suggest there were 4,275 documented fatalities in Indian factories between 2010 and 2012. Analysts say that even by the most conservative estimate, the actual numbers could be at least ten times higher if continued…

Jeff Bezos defends Amazon s lack of profitsJeff Bezos defends Amazon's lack of profits, stance on publishers

Amazon.com Inc
(Jeff Bezos, the chief executive…)
NEW YORK: Jeff Bezos , the chief executive of Amazon.com Inc , was unapologetic about his twenty-year-old company's lack of profit during a rare public appearance on Tuesday, noting he spends just six hours a year on investor relations.
Bezos also discussed Amazon's acrimonious dispute with publisher Hachette Book Group and his purchase of the Washington Post. He acknowledged that Amazon had a succession plan in place, but remained tight-lipped about the details.
His comments come a day after Moody's Investors Service downgraded its outlook on Amazon to "negative," citing the company's upcoming debt offering and the "lack of visibility" about how the funds would be deployed.
Investors have grown increasingly unhappy about Amazon's spending and lack of disclosure about future plans. Its shares have fallen more than 18 per cent this year, despite a 14 per cent rise in the Nasdaq.
Bezos, relaxed in jeans and a gray jacket, defended Amazon's culture as one willing to spend on new projects, even if they flop like its poor-selling Fire phone.
"We are a large company, but we are also still a start-up. There is a lot of volatility in start-ups," Bezos said at a conference organized by the Business Insider blog in New York.
Bezos, an investor in Business Insider, defended Amazon's approach during its drawn-out contract dispute with Hachette, which came to light after Amazon delayed deliveries and removed pre-order options for several Hachette titles. The dispute was settled in November.
Publishers are in better shape because of e-books, which became popular after Amazon launched the Kindle e-reader in 2007, he said, adding that books are still too expensive.
"It's difficult for incumbents who have a sweet thing to embrace change," Bezos said. "Making reading more affordable is not going to make authors less money. ... It's going to make authors more money."
Bezos entered another embattled industry last year when he bought the Washington Post from the Graham family. He was initially surprised when approached about the sale, but said Don Graham convinced him. He plans to turn the Post into a national and international newspaper.
Bezos, 50, also acknowledged that there is a succession plan in place for him and his executives. When asked to reveal the next generation of leadership, he said: "It's a secret."

Flair & Square: Decoding Dress CodesWritten by Namrata Zakaria |
Posted: December 3, 2014 6:32 am | Updated: December 3, 2014 11:13 am
Much of Mumbai has its knickers in a twist with the news of a Borivli college imposing dressing diktats on its students. The college forbids shorts, slippers and sleeveless clothing, and also visible piercings and tattoos. The newspaper reports deem it a violation of the students’ freedoms, and those radio jockeys that I’m addicted to for some reason, are the self-styled judge and jury in their mocking tirades.
Uniforms in schools, both private and government, are mandatory in India. They are held up as the greatest social equalisers. With everyone dressed the same, no one is under pressure to impress. Besides, they enhance school pride, and give the young students a sentiment of belonging and a feeling of importance.
School uniforms are welcome and wanted in India. But different countries have varied reactions to them. In the UK, where the idea of school uniforms is said to have begun in the 16th century, the idea seems dated today. Schools that espouse uniforms are usually snobby and upper crust, and champion the idea of militarism. In Australia, each school can set its own uniform policy. In France, school uniforms have not been enforced since 1968.
My school —  an old colonial-style convent run by super-strict nuns who thought that all schoolgirls wanted to do is attract boys — had insane hair rules. If it even skimmed the shoulders it had to be tied up. Pin it if you couldn’t rubberband it. No pony tails if you could braid it. Only black hair accessories. No fringes. Our skirts had to touch our knees. I had my seams ripped open by the headgirl’s finger nails one morning because mine did not.
The newer international schools are even stricter. School buses are mandatory at my son’s school. Mostly because it is a traffic nightmare, but also because they do not like the idea of some kids driving up in Mercedes’ and others in Marutis. I know of a few posh schools that provide same-same school bags, pencil boxes and even stationery for their kids. Parents welcome these as privileges of pricey schools.
But colleges are another story in India. Most of them — even the specialty-training ones — cost very little in fees. Herein lies the biggest problem. The five years of junior and degree college are seen as free and fun time. After the sobriety of schools, colleges are nothing but five years of freedom.
Bunking classes isn’t a big deal (imagine bunking half your school day, or even a class when in school. A letter is sent home or a phone call made). Is this because the children are almost adults? I doubt it. Since a college education costs relatively so little, it isn’t considered that serious.
As soon as one finishes school, the tenth grade in many parts of India, one’s hair is dyed and the style is changed. Spectacles give way to contact lenses, tattoos and piercings come in. This is the age for for trial-and-error with your personal style. Kids wants to be allowed to express continued…

Changing trend: At IITs  startups & e commerce firms play pied piper for graduatesCodeNation
("Students rate these companies…)
MUMBAI: At least one in every 9 students graduating from the 2015 batch across IITs is likely to join an ecomm firm/startup.
Data collated on Tuesday (day 2 of placement season) from prominent recruiters as well as campus placement cells at many IITs suggests that ecommerce firms/startups will roll out a minimum of 1,000-1,200 offers during the next 3-4 months of placements.
About 9,000 students will graduate out of 16 IITs this year.
Four big players — Flipkart (200-220), Ola-Cabs (200), Snapdeal (100-plus) and Housing.com (100-150) — alone will make around 670 offers at IIT campuses. These four companies hired only 213 grads last year — a 215% increase this year.Acombination of the hectic startup activity — an estimated 800 ventures launched every year — and billions of dollars pumped into consumer Internet ventures from big names like Tiger Global and SoftBank have contributed to this huge surge in hiring.
"Our growth plans are so aggressive that we need top talent to drive growth. Our hiring plans are a function of the pace at which we are growing," said Saurabh Nigam, VP-HR, Snapdeal.
Snapdeal has quadrupled its hiring targets from the IITs this year.
Ola is visiting the IITs at Delhi , Kanpur, Madras and Bombay and plans a 10-fold hiring increase from year last. "We are expanding aggressively into newer cities and going deeper in cities we are already present.
Continuous influx of great talent can help us grow faster and smarter," Anand Subramanian, director - marketing communication, said.
Several other startups, including CodeNation , TaxiForSure , Indus Insights, LimeRoad, Knowlarity Communications, Fuzzy Logix, Vizury and BrowserStack among others, are planning to hire anywhere between 10 and 50 students each across IITs. "Students are excited by these companies, for their work culture, the independence and even the compensation structure," says Parth Vaswani, overall placement coordinator, IITKanpur.
"For many, they probably rank right behind the software sector in terms of the pecking order," he says.
Several of these companies also recruit for IT-software roles.
Vaswani expects at least 150 such offers this year compared to 60-odd last year.
At IIT-Bombay, around 60-70 companies -- almost 20% of the total that have signed up so far --fall in the ecommerce/startup bracket.
Students rate these companies highly, which is why several of them get slotted in the first few days of campus placement, Mohak Mehta, BTech student representative for IIT-Bombay said.
Across IITs, these ecommerce/startup companies are hiring across a variety of roles for salaries that range between Rs 10-18 lakh, going up to a maximum of Rs 24 lakh from the likes of Code-Nation.

30 years of a tragedy that killed over 20 000EYE BROWSE
How Bhopal and I Betrayed Our Own
30 years ago today, 40 tons of poisonous gas leaked from a factory, killed more than 20,000 people, injured over 550,000. Everyone now associates Bhopal with the world’s deadliest industrial disaster, but most of the city actually does not. Bhopal’s own amnesia has been partly responsible for why the victims have not gotten justice for so long. Why do so many residents seem so indifferent to what happened in their own city?

Artist Pete Dunne's Untitled. Dunne was living in a small town less than 100km from Bhopal at the time of the disaster. …
On winter afternoons in Bhopal I’d rush out of class to grab a window seat on the school bus. If I got a window, I’d ride home sipping from my water bottle, tugging at the ribbons in my hair and watching the city pass by. This bus window became my first view of the Bhopal Gas tragedy .
I was probably in Class 2 when I first saw the women one winter afternoon at a busy square. From the tiny window of my bus, I saw a handful of them standing with posters and placards. Some of them were raising slogans that I was too young to understand. The others were silent. My memory (unreliable as it may be) recorded most of them wearing black burqas.
Once I had seen them, I started noticing and remembering their presence. I saw them regularly in different parts of the city, but most often at Roshanpura and Board Office – the busiest and most important squares in the city, where public protests are frequently organized. I remember another afternoon when I saw them right in front of me as I sat on my father’s old Bajaj Chetak scooter. We were returning home from an outing when I saw them standing and shouting slogans in a square in Old Bhopal. That afternoon, as I bounced up and down on the pillion of the scooter, I kept asking my father who these women were. I asked all the way home, but got no proper answer.
Through my childhood, I was very curious about these women shouting slogans on the streets of Bhopal but I had no real way of knowing more about them. Slowly, I saw their faces changing from young to old. Some of them began to use henna to mask their greying hair. They were all aging, but their passion and intensity were the same. Frequently, new faces would join the protests. When I couldn’t spot the regular faces, I’d worry and wonder, “Where is that woman? Is she ill? Is she busy?” Without registering it, I imagined a relationship between myself and these strangers who shouted, held posters, cried, lit candles and whack the poster of an old, bespectacled man with their chappals. I was stuck in the ‘get-good-marks-or-die’ trajectory and had limited access to the world beyond my school, tuitions and home. My parents thought my inquisitiveness was a phaltu ki cheez – a useless distraction from ‘real studies’.
I was 17 before I knew what the women had been protesting. I had just won a war with my parents over which newspapers would be subscribed to at home.
In one of those new newspapers, I spotted the women and learnt for the first time that they were survivors of the tragedy. They were the ‘Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila Udyog Sangathan’, who had each lost family in the gas tragedy. And now finally I knew the name of the old man with spectacles whose poster the Sanghathan used to fall upon with chappals – Warren Anderson .
I was born, bred and educated three years after the ‘ world’s worst industrial disaster’ hit Bhopal. I spent most of my life in the lake city. And today, though I live in Delhi, I go back to Bhopal every few months. And still I see the women who for 30 summers, monsoons and winters have been protesting, demanding justice – proper compensation, medical facilities, economic and environmental rehabilitation and punishment for those responsible for the deaths of their loved ones.

On the night of December 2, 1984, continuing into the next morning, around 40 tons of poisonous methyl isocyanate (MIC) leaked from the storage tanks of the Bhopal-based Union Carbide India Ltd (UCIL). The gas killed more than 20,000 people. It left over 5,50,000 others injured and disabled. The UCIL factory, which was on Beraisa Road, manufactured the pesticides Sevin and Temic inside the plant. Both involved the use of the deadly MIC. As Frontline reported in 2010, “the plant also manufactured MIC and stored it in underground tanks, identified as tanks no. 610, 611 and 619.” Around 9,00,000 people lived in Bhopal in December 1984 and the lethal gas leak affected citizens living in about 36 municipal wards of the city. In 2014, thousands of gas-affected people are still struggling to stay alive in different hospitals in the city. In various courts and secretarial offices of Madhya Pradesh and Delhi, hundreds of long legal battles are still being fought for everything from adequate compensation, proper medication, economic and environmental rehabilitation of the gas victims and demands for an official governmental documentation of the multiple ramifications of the aftermath.

In June 2010, 25 years after the lethal gas leak, a trial court in Bhopal delivered the first judgment on the gas disaster. But the judgment that sentenced eight Union Carbide plant employees including Keshub Mahindra, then former chairman of the Indian arm of Union Carbide, managing director VP Gokhale, vice-president Kishore Kamdar, works manager J Mukund, production manager SP Chowdhury, plant superintendent KV Shetty and production assistant SI Qureshi to two years’ imprisonment was justifiably considered too little, too late by the different activist groups campaigning for a just closure for Bhopal gas victims.
On another front, Warren Anderson remained absent throughout the trial and was declared an absconder by the Indian government. The fight for justice of Bhopal gas survivors reached a new impasse with his death early this September.
As I write this, the news that over 500 people have been affected by poisonous fumes from hazardous chemical waste being dumped in a river in Maharashtra has just broken. The incident, just four days before the 30th anniversary of the Bhopal disaster, took place in the Ulhasnagar town situated 37km away from Mumbai. People complained of headaches, burning eyes and breathlessness. Ulhasnagar is considered one of the world’s largest hubs for the manufacture of jeans. Here, it is reported that people started falling ill after inhaling toxic fumes originating from chemicals dumped in the river in the dead of night.

I have been haunted by the faces of the protestors from my childhood. Today, the question that disturbs me is why it took me 17 years just to learn about the women I had seen all my life. And why did my family – my parents, grandparents (and our extended family living in Bhopal for generations) – their friends, my friends, our neighbors, my school teachers, doctors, mechanics, shop keepers, bank managers, engineers, vegetable sellers, daily wage laborers and others all seem to me to be indifferent to what had happened in their own city?
It is true that I had also grown up listening to all kinds of conversations about ‘compensation’ . Everyone in Bhopal is interested in finding out and talking about compensation. ‘Who got how much compensation?’ and ‘How can I claim more?’ seemed to me to be the most pressing memory of the disaster for Bhopalis. We as a city never stood with the survivors of the world’s deadliest industrial disaster, who still suffer 30 years on. While the world knows of Bhopal as the city of the gas disaster, why did we as Bhopalis never come out on the streets in support of the gas survivors? Why was the question of their lives, health and justice, never our question?
Do cities have a mechanism of passing on their history to newcomers or children growing within their borders? Or do all cities ask you to make do with a jigsaw puzzle of footprints and unreliable memories for their children to solve? Does it always take an effort to find out the stories of what had once happened on the land where they were born? Is it important to know the soil where one is born at all? In our world of rootless, migrant workers, is our memory and identity still really linked to our hometowns?
Whenever I read about the elaborate records and memorials the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki keep, I feel depressed. In these Japanese cities anyone can visit the memorials and learn what had happened on the nights of August 6 and 9, 1945 , and their horrific aftermath. All over Germany, memorials and museums educate younger generations about the Holocaust, but also act as reminders of their commitment to atonement.
What is it about Bhopal that we have chosen to forget? Or does this indifference and lack of sensitivity towards gas survivors have more to do with the explicit disconnect – cultural and emotional – between New and Old Bhopal?

My old friend Sikandar Malik was born and bought up in Bhopal and is madly in love with the city. He is a young historian working on his first book on the Begums of Bhopal. He is passionate about the history and culture of the city and has, in recent years, organized cultural and heritage walks around Bhopal. He, like me, was born after the gas disaster hit the city, and is a quintessential ‘puraane shehar ka bashinda’(old city boy).
On a cold November evening, he spoke to me about the giant statue of an eagle in Iqbal Maidan – ‘Shaheen’ – and said, “The poet Allama Muhammad Iqbal, who gave us ‘Saare jahan se accha’, stayed in Bhopal for three long stretches and wrote around 14 nazams (poems) here. He stayed at Sheesh Mahal for a long time and wrote many poems. He used to draw inspiration from the phoenix – the bird that used to burn and then rise from its own ashes. Bhopal is exactly like that. The gas leak undoubtedly devastated us…but slowly we are rising from our own ashes. There’s a lot more to Bhopal than the Gas Tragedy. Though, everybody knows about the pathetic attitude of government towards the gas survivors. But 30 years is too long a time for anybody to feel sick and mad. I feel that the younger generation of the city wants that the issues of the gas survivors be addressed quickly, their issues be sorted out, and that the city moves on.”
He says, “Bhopal is a medieval town functioning in modern times. Normally, cities are carved out by disturbing nature but Bhopal co-exists with nature. Besides the nucleus of our city…the big lake, Bhopal was originally built around seven hills. Bhopal also has a syncretic culture where large populations of both Hindus and Muslims have been living together for ages…speaking the same dialect and sharing common cultural values. Since Bhopal is placed at the cross-section of Gondwana and Malwa regions, Bhopalis have inherited influences from both regions. On one hand, while we are most talkative and laid-back like the people of Malwa, we also have the aggression and thirst for adventure like the Gondwana people. People still play games like ‘change-ashte’ [a variant of chess played in Bhopal and parts of Malwa with tamarind seeds, which are moved about on squares drawn in chalk] on the cement slabs of the graveyard next to Sophia College! Can you name any other city where people chat under the sun and play ludo and chess in a graveyard? We love spending nights talking and eating on streets – patiyebazi.”
But all this is only in Old Bhopal, he says. “In New Bhopal, we don’t consider the colonies beyond New Market as part of our city. Before Independence, we had dense forests beyond the present New Market area. People in [New Bhopal] do not connect with even Old Bhopal, forget the Gas survivors there.”

On the night of December 2, 1984, my father, grandfather and grandmother were all asleep in the Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) township accommodation where they lived at the time. My mother wasn’t in Bhopal then. The BHEL township falls in a distant part of New Bhopal and wasn’t affected by the MIC leak that night. The closest area affected was Govindpura ward – more than 6km from our house. The gas touched no one in my family or neighborhood. But what happened in that BHEL neighborhood (and in many other neighborhoods of new Bhopal) in the aftermath of the gas leak changed the stories of the women I saw through my bus window.
I grew up in a monotonous BHEL township environment where everybody is born in the same BHEL hospital, goes to the same BHEL society schools, goes to the same tuition teachers, is under tremendous pressure to come first in class, lives in the same red-and-yellow apartments, grows old walking in the same green parks through the generally drizzling roads, makes ‘apna ghar’ in the same residential colony of the city, falls ill, dies in the same BHEL hospital where they are born and is cremated in the same mortuary with other people of the same religion in the colony.
After surviving the evergreen and ever-gloomy environment of the BHEL township, I can easily understand the disconnect that children born in army cantonments or other government townships have from the outer world. Like many government officials in technical jobs, my father is also a Bharatiya Janata Party supporter. He has been a volunteer for the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) for 30 years and is a staunch supporter of their ideology. Running to tuitions in Bhopal rains, cycling kilometers carrying lunch for my grandparents in hospital and serving chai to RSS volunteers are among the most pressing memories of my childhood.
My world took a 180-degree turn when I chose to study journalism. I had my share of fights to do this, but that’s a different story. For the first time in college, I met Bhopalis who lived outside the BHEL township. I also made my first few friends from Old Bhopal. Three boys – one Muslim and two Hindus – took me around the purana shehar. Later, I learned how to drive and it revolutionized my life. I had been thirsty for years, and now I drove crazily around Bhopal, drinking in the beauty of its chaotic, laidback existence. Soon I became a regular visitor to essentially ‘Bhopali’ areas of city like Chowk and Sarafa Bazaar, which form the busiest market in the city; the beautiful Motiya Talab behind the Taj-ul Masjid, said to be one of the biggest mosques in Asia, and Badi Jheel, the big lake that forms Bhopal’s nucleus.
During this time, I made friends across Bhopal, joined foreign language centers and libraries, did college theater and watched world cinema. As a student of Journalism, the meaning of bureaucratic government buildings like Vallabh Bhawan, Satpuda Bhawan, Narmada Bhawan and the District Court changed for me. Slowly, my interests outside start to seep into my home. By now, we subscribed to Panchjanya a weekly paper published by the RSS, the liberal Indian Express, and the mildly left-leaning The Hindu, all under one roof. In a house full of paintings, idols and posters of Hindu gods, I carved out my own space for the posters of BR Ambedkar, Nellie Bly, Edna Buchanan and Che Guevara (whom my parents called ‘cigar-wala gunda’). My Bhopali friends and the educational and cultural institutions of the city opened up the world before me.

Recently, I asked my 55-year-old father about his memories of the night of the gas leak and its aftermath. After a few seconds of silence, he said, “We got to know the next morning that MIC had leaked. But we were not affected at all. We slept all night in our homes.” When we talk about the whole city’s obsession with compensation, he adds, “Yes, everybody in Bhopal tried to get compensation. Your grandfather also filled our claim forms because everybody around was doing the same. Our friends and neighbors…everybody was filling the claim forms. They insisted and so your grandfather filled the forms. Eventually, we were declared fit during our medical examinations and that was the end. But many of our friends forged documents and paid bribes to the officers of the Bhopal Gas Tragedy Relief and Rehabilitation Department for getting compensation. People brought their relatives, cousins and friends from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal. They forged documents so that all of them could get compensation. Once, I went to my barber’s shop in Bhopal. I saw many new faces working in his shop and asked him about it. He smiled and told me that they were all his cousins. They’d just arrived from Uttar Pradesh to go through their medical examinations. The barber had fixed things to ensure that his cousins were shown as ‘present in Bhopal on the night of gas leak’ and ‘badly affected’ on paper. Also, in those days it was easy to know that compensation money was being distributed in the city. All of a sudden, when you saw a lot of construction happening everywhere in Bhopal, people who had not enough to eat suddenly building new floors in their homes and buying new cars…you knew that they had received false compensation.”

<At 23, as a journalist, I filed my first investigative cover story on the illegal and unethical drug trials going on in Madhya Pradesh. The story had a special focus on the Bhopal Memorial Hospital and Research Center (BMHRC), the government-run hospital that was built to treat gas victims and research the disaster’s aftermath. My investigation focused on two patients –Ramadhar Singh and Shankarlal. While Ramadhar Singh had been prescribed medicines named ‘Plato 4244593’ and ‘AZT 3443565’, Shankarlal was given ‘Study Drug 21620’. These were all drugs under trial, a fact that Ramadhar Singh and Shankarlal were not informed about. The doctors at BMHRC had also cannily asked them to return the packaging of the tablets after they had been consumed. Already battling the painful effects of MIC, Shankarlal died soon after these drug trials. When I last met him in 2010, after the story was published, Ramadhar Shrivastav said, “Since the gas leak happened I’d not been able to breathe without difficulty. I went to the BMHRC for my chest pain and breathing. They made me take some medicines and now my jaws are all swollen and melting. I can’t even speak properly now.”
Several inquiry committees were formed by Madhya Pradesh government to look into the drug trials after the issue was raised in the State Assembly in 2010. One was under the chairmanship of the then-principal health secretary of Madhya Pradesh, and another inquiry was held in the Economic Offences wing of the state. They did submit undisclosed recommendations later, but nothing came of them. The matter is now in cold storage.
Over the years, other victims shared stories of their routine humiliation at the BMHRC. As 80-year-old Halki Bai told me one day, “I told the doctor that I caught the gas and I am not able to breathe or see. The doctor always asks me the same question. Which gas? LPG? Now you tell me which gas can affect a resident of Chola Road of Bhopal? The whole world knows that we fell ill because of MIC gas but our own doctors make fun of us by mocking us and asking such obvious, humiliating and silly questions!”
For most of his life, senior journalist and writer Rashid Kidwai has lived and worked in Bhopal. He says, “It is such a paradox that we are identified across the world because of the gas disaster. Anywhere you go, the moment you mention that you are from Bhopal... people immediately empathize and ask questions about the gas tragedy. But as a city, we are not concerned about our own people. We have no implicit or explicit sense of being a concerned citizenry. The gravity of the situation can be judged from just one point. It is that we still do not have any record of those who were killed or disabled. The government just never kept any records. When we do not have any records of the dead and directly disabled, we cannot even think of having a systematic record of the multiple kinds of diseases and disabilities in the children born in the next generation. We do not have any memorial or history, oral or written, of what had happened in Bhopal. If you pass through the lanes of Bhopal, you will never realize that this city has suffered almost a holocaust so recently. How will children identify understand the disaster when the government and the people are not bothered?”
He says, “The gas tragedy is actually a cow to be milked by everyone except the survivors. The BMHRC, the pathetic behavior of the doctors, innumerable complaints about the gas relief department, the indifference of the city and the anti-people approach of Bhopal courts all speak volumes about the tragedy that happened to the gas victims after the gas tragedy.”

On the condition of anonymity, a 70-year-old RSS volunteer from Bhopal shared an anecdote from the week the gas leaked. He says, “I remember that Bajrang Dal troops came to us and said that we should collect men to do ‘seva’ in Hindu camps. They were saying that some big camps had only Muslim doctors. And they were first treating only Muslims and leaving behind our Hindu bhais. So these troops of the Bajrang Dal went around town raising slogans like ‘Hindu Bhaiyon ko gas se bachana hai, unhe bhi ilaaj dilana hai’. (We have to protect our Hindu brothers from gas and get them treated). I work for the RSS but even I was uncomfortable with these slogans and Bajrang Dal troops. When you see thousands of dead bodies in front of you, you cannot think of anything, forget religion. You are just numb.”
I went to meet the Agrawals, who have lived in old Bhopal for seven generations. They’ve run one of the oldest and most popular and vegetarian restaurants – Agrawal Poori Bhandar – situated in Chowk, Old Bhopal. Shyam Babu Agrawal is 85 years old and currently unwell. He had been instrumental in ensuring that those who survived the gas leak on the night of December 2 had something to eat when they woke up to a reeking city of corpses.
His 52-year-old son Sanjay Agrawal says, “The next morning. Everybody was running from wherever in whatever clothes they were in. The situation was so bad that those who survived the gas were later dying of hunger. Then my father and his elder brother ordered our cooks to cook till the last grain available in the shop was finished. People came in, ate, took food for their families and went. This continued for weeks after the disaster.”
When I ask him if any communal tensions arose in the aftermath of the gas leak, he said, “My father himself arranged for the kafan of at least 2,000 Muslims and ensured their proper burial according to their religious customs. These communal elements you are talking about are never present in Bhopal – I mean, Old Bhopal. The different kinds of migrant populations that later came in the new part of the city…I cannot say anything about them. But we Bhopalis have grown up in a very syncretic and close culture. Here people helped each other during the disaster across the lines of caste and religion.”
The well-known Hindi writer Manzoor Ehtesham has lived in Old Bhopal all his life. He was 44 when the gas leaked. Years later, he wrote a short story named “Talafi” (“Compensation”). “I was watching kathak by Malavika Sarkar on TV that night. Around 11pm we all went to sleep. Later that night my children began to cough. When I woke up that night…I saw people running. It was actually like a crowd of people running to a silent track. People were running and falling down but there was no sound. It was a very cold night.”
“Later, the compensation process happened. Everywhere there was chaos and the government was extremely callous. Those who had money were forging documents and getting compensation while the genuinely poor victim struggled all his life to collect enough proof to prove that he really was a victim. I have seen gas victims crying and pleading in front of bureaucrats and officers to just open the ‘compensation bank accounts’. I’ve never seen anything more cruel in my life.”

Raja was born ten days after the gas leaked in 1984. His right eyelid drooped slightly when he was born. He had a series of surgeries to correct it – the last one was about a decade ago – but his right eye closed after the surgeries, and he can only see with his left eye. He is now 30 and unemployed, a resident of JP Nagar (one of the several slums situated close to the Union Carbide factory). The slum colonies of JP Nagar, Qazi Camp and Arif Nagar along Chola Road were the worst hit during the leak. “My parents were badly affected by the gas and remained ill for all their remaining years. My mother died eight years after the gas leak. She’d damaged her lungs and could never breathe properly afterwards. My father died in 2013 after 29 years of extreme, daily pain. He couldn’t work either. I wanted to study. But I am weak and I can’t see properly. My right eye is often swollen and it hurts all the time. We got Rs 25,000 each as compensation in 1990. How I am going to survive with Rs 25,000? The government has done nothing for our rehabilitation.”
While I was growing up in BHEL colony, Raja still lived in the neighborhood shattered by the leak. Activists say around 2 lakh people lived in the region around Chola Road, all whom were affected by the gas in some way. Around 1,000 people from those neighborhoods were killed. Eighty-year-old Haleeman Bee, who lives close to Raja, has been ill for thirty years. Sitting alone in her one-room house, she says, “I was 50 when the gas leaked. It started with breathing problems and now I have cancer. All the time white bacteria-like insects keep coming out from my head. All my hair is gone but still the kitaanoon (bacteria) come out of my scalp. No one comes near me now and I live alone here. I keep burning some fire in the room to remove the bacteria, but they don’t go. It’d have been better that I died that day and escaped this suffering of 30 years.”
I went to Widows’ Colony in Bhopal to meet Ifra Hameed and her mother Shaheen. Like me, Ifra was born three years after the gas leak. Unlike me, she was born in an area intensely affected by the leak to a young couple that was exposed heavily to the gas leak. Ifra was born with severe disability – her legs were misshapen at birth, and she has never been able to use the lower half of her body. In a firozi dupatta, with large eyes, jet-black hair and a big smile, Ifra is beautiful. Her 48-year-old mother Shaheen has been ill with breathing and digestion problems for 30 years.
While Ifra remains silent, her mother slowly wipes away tears as she says, “I’ve worked very hard to keep this girl alive. We have spent last 27 years massaging her legs so that they can straighten a bit and she may get a moment of relief from her pain. She had suffered so many operations and spent most of her life in hospitals. We got Rs 25,000. You tell me, is that proportionate for someone who is disabled for life? What worries me the most is this. What will happen to her after I die?”

Abdul Jabbar, the convener of the Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila Udyog Sangathan, is now an old acquaintance. His tireless work for the gas survivors is known to anyone who knows Bhopal. I have seen him grow old. I have seen him take quick breaks to give himself insulin injections and go back to work. Once, a couple of years ago, he said, “Had I been a cartoonist, I’d have made a cartoon. It’d show all gas victims as a dead body lying in the open. And the Gas Rehabilitation department, the government, bureaucracy, judiciary, police, lawyers, CBI, writers, activists…I would draw them all as vultures and foxes tearing and eating up the pieces of that corpse. Everybody is feeding on the pain of gas victims. The victims were destroyed by the gas leak. But when they were running against time that cold December night, they had no idea that the real tragedy was waiting for them in the years to come.”

Playing in Adelaide  absolutely up to the individualMore
No pressure on players for quick Test return
A reworked four-Test schedule for the Australia-India series was released late on Monday night, with the Adelaide Test brought forward by three days and the Brisbane Test slotted in second.

Kohli leaves a bat and cap at a memorial for Phil Hughes in Adelaide.Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland has said it will be up to individual players whether they feel ready for the first Test, which begins in Adelaide next Tuesday, six days after Phillip Hughes is laid to rest in his home town of Macksville.
A reworked four-Test schedule for the Australia-India series was released late on Monday night, with the Adelaide Test brought forward by three days and the Brisbane Test slotted in second. The fixture was developed in conjunction with the Australian Cricketers' Association and the BCCI.
Australia's players are expected to enter camp on Thursday - the day after Hughes' funeral - to begin preparations for the Adelaide Test. There is no question the match, at Hughes' adopted home ground, will be emotional for the Australians, and Sutherland said it would be up to each player to decide whether he felt ready to return to Test cricket so soon after farewelling Hughes.
"Absolutely up to the individual," Sutherland said. "Any player that is not comfortable or doesn't feel right, or there is medical advice to suggest that they're not quite right, then we will obviously understand that and I'm sure the broader public will understand that as well.
"Right now, there's a funeral tomorrow and let's understand that's going to be difficult enough as it is. There'll be a great temptation for people to speculate about who's going to play and how they're feeling. I'd just encourage everyone to give the players their space and let them in their own way work through that.
"Understand that we and the ACA will be supporting them, and no one will think ill of anyone who feels uncomfortable about it. Test cricket is a different game. It's not just going out there and playing a game of sport for a couple of hours. You need to go out there and commit to five days. You need to front up day after day after day. It's a big step and it's not just an ordinary sporting match."
The Adelaide Test will be the first in a rigorous new schedule that effectively has the Adelaide, Brisbane and Melbourne matches all back-to-back, before a slightly longer break ahead of the Sydney Test in January. The new fixture means that Melbourne's Boxing Day Test is the only one to retain its original dates.
"There's nothing perfect about what we've come up [with] here but we appreciate everyone's support and understanding in these tragic and extraordinary circumstances," Sutherland said. "The schedule will inconvenience a lot of people. We understand that. But we very much hope that in light of these extraordinary circumstances that everyone can see the big picture."
The tight nature of the original schedule meant there was a very real chance the Brisbane Test could have been cancelled entirely - Sutherland said such a move "was close". However, he said at no stage did Cricket Australia feel under pressure from broadcasters to deliver the full four-Test series or worry about compensation if the Gabba Test did not go ahead.
"It's been remarkable to talk to our commercial partners," Sutherland said. "I've had conversations with chief executives of our commercial partners including broadcasters, who have said 'we completely understand the circumstances you are in, we should be the last ones you worry about, just get it done, do whatever you've got to do to work it through but don't feel any pressure from us'. I think that's been magnificent."
Several of Australia's players have returned to light training with their states over the past two days. Josh Hazlewood bowled in the nets in Sydney on Monday, while most of his New South Wales team-mates kept to fitness training. Ryan Harris was bowling in the nets in Brisbane on Tuesday. The ACA and Cricket Australia will ensure all the players have access to support over the coming days, including counselling and sports psychologists.
Michael Clarke flew to Macksville on Monday morning and Sutherland was speaking at Sydney Airport on Tuesday morning, en route to the town himself. The funeral for Hughes will be held at 2pm on Macksville and will be broadcast live on Channel Nine, ABC News 24 TV, ABC Radio and Fairfax Radio.
India will be represented at the funeral by players Virat Kohli , Rohit Sharma and M Vijay, team director Ravi Shastri, coach Duncan Fletcher and team manager Arshad Ayub.

To Save Democracy  Act Nowreddit
Aristotle claimed that democracy depended on a secure middle class in a society without a great gap between rich and poor. In other words, Aristotle would have told us our democracy is on the ropes. I didn't learn this by reading the Greek philosopher himself, but from an insightful paper written by William Galston, a fellow at the Brookings Institution. He took the philosopher's maxim as a starting point and examined the economic crisis we face. Despite modest and steady job growth and government programs like the Affordable Care Act, Social Security, and Medicare, he foresees trouble ahead if we don't act now.
Galston sums it up: "If economic growth and well-being are in jeopardy, so are our political arrangements. The bargain is being challenged from without. Competition from rising economies outside Europe and North America -- some embedded in democratic institutions, others not -- has reduced the ability of established economies to maintain high levels of growth and employment."
We've kept up the appearance of economic well-being by channeling plentiful cash into the stock market, and a rising market has traditionally been a key indicator of economic health. Not now. The vitality of the stock market has little relationship to the job market. "Relatively few jobs now being created offer incomes in the middle range: most are in lower-wage services, and most of the rest are in the high-skilled professions that require advanced training." This simply intensifies the disparity between rich and poor, in the absence of more robust job growth and/or rising wages: the rich get richer. You know the rest. Companies now have the technological means to increase production without new hiring. This has never been the case in history -- we're standing at a crossroads.
Galson asserts that the central job of democracy is to provide a peaceful, orderly environment where standards of living can progressively get better. When it comes to this central task, we've been losing the game for decades -- but since 2008, the engine of progress has seized up. "Since the end of the Great Recession, the recovery has been the weakest of the entire postwar period. Only wage increases can generate more vigorous growth," he says. The threat is clear: either we could slip into the sort of stagnation Japan has suffered since the '90s, but even more dangerous is the prospect of social disorder. Galston zeroes in on the possibility of revolt by quoting staggering unemployment figures for Europe:
Young adults without occupations, especially those with higher education and rising expectations, are a classic source of political instability. For example, countries that make it difficult to fire workers have made it almost impossible for young adults to find jobs. Unemployment in that cohort has risen to Depression-era levels -- more than 50 percent in Greece and Spain, 43 percent in Italy, and 23.5 percent in the Euro zone as a whole.
His point? Young, aspiring and yet unemployed youth are the seedbed for disorder, rebellion and ultimately political revolution.
Behind the disparity between Wall Street and Main Street is yet another quiet trend Galson points out, which leads corporations away from national identification, so that the responsibilities of citizenship have a weaker and weaker sway over those who are reaping the greatest rewards.
Here's how he envisions a way out of this fix:
• Adopt full employment as the central priority for government and business.
• Business should focus on raising wages. Profits are at record levels and cash is plentiful "for large firms who are accumulating huge stocks of retained earnings that languish on the sidelines ore are used to fund mergers and stock buy-backs."
Here is where his vision struck me as simple and brilliant. He suggests that government could lower tax rates for generous firms with more generous compensation policies. For example, it could favor those that share profits from productivity increases with their workers, rather than siphoning as much profit as possible to shareholders.
Beyond this, he points to a moral awakening as a consequence of reviving the middle class. The renewal would be both economic and moral.  The hope that comes with more disposable income encourages delayed gratification.  He quotes Benjamin Friedman's The Moral Consequences of Economic Growth.
The value of a rising standard of living lies not just in the concrete improvements it brings to how individuals live but in how it shapes the social, political and, ultimately, the moral character of a people. Economic growth -- meaning a rising standard of living for the clear majority of citizens -- more often than not fosters greater opportunity, tolerance of diversity, social mobility, commitment to fairness, and dedication to democracy. But when living standards stagnate or decline, most societies make little or more progress toward any of these goals, and in all too many instances they plainly retrogress.
In other words, if you want to preserve the integrity of our culture, you must first revitalize the economy for all Americans. He offers some sensible, apolitical, steps toward getting our country, and the developed world as a whole, on the course back toward conditions that will ensure everyone's opportunity to earn a better life through hard work. In other words, we need to look at employment and wages if we want to preserve the way of life we have all taken for granted until the past few years. Yet, given the current political realities, we need a Congress full of men and women willing to put partisanship aside and deal with the realities we face today. We can only hope they'll arrive soon.
What do you think? Is income inequality a threat to our democracy?

How to get to National Airport with part of southbound GW Parkway shut down— Dana Hedgpeth (@postmetrogirl) December 2, 2014
Work is currently underway to repair a  large sinkhole  in the southbound lanes of the George Washington Memorial Parkway at Route 123 with a goal of reopening it by 5 a.m. Wednesday, according to Doug Hecox, a spokesman for the Federal Highway Administration. Hecox said that the hole has been backfilled and paving is set to begin.
“There have been no surprises,” he said Tuesday afternoon.
 
Meantime, the U.S. Park Police offered some alternative routes from Interstate 495 into the District and to National Airport.
Note: Because of the repairs, the ramp from Route 123 onto southbound GW Parkway is closed. Motorists, however, can enter the GW Parkway southbound at Spout Run. All northbound lanes of the GW Parkway are open.
Here are some suggested alternatives:
I-495 to Exit 31 Eastbound 97 (Georgia Ave.)
I-495 to Exit 33 Eastbound 185 (Connecticut Ave.)
I-495 to Exit 41 (Clara Barton Parkway)
I-495 to Exit 50 Rt. 50 (Arlington Blvd) towards DC
I-495 to Exit 52 (236) follow to North Washington Street go north to DC or Airport

Dhruva Space gears up for launch within 2 ye...Inspired from Isro's Mars mission Dhruva Space gears up for commercial launch within two years

REPRESENTATIVE IMAGE: Dhruva Space sealed a deal with Amsat India, and the grouping will develop radio payloads for the satellite being built by the Bengaluru company.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
BENGALURU: A two-year-old startup is aiming to be the first Indian company to design and manufacture satellites as it gears up for a commercial launch within the next two years. Dhruva Space, co-founded by space technologist Sanjay Nekkanti, is developing two satellites that weigh less than 30 kg each — the first one will be a technology demonstrator and the second, a private satellite for the Indian arm of Amateur Radio Operators , a global non-profit body that promotes launch of radio satellites.
On Sunday, Dhruva Space sealed a deal with Amsat India , and the grouping will develop radio payloads for the satellite being built by the Bengaluru company.
"India is the face of future frugal innovation," said Nekkanti, 25, a holder of two masters degrees in space technology and spacecraft instrumentation from Lulea University of Technology in Sweden. "Isro has proved that. It is now our turn to prove that for the private space industry," he said, adding that the inspiration came from Isro's Mars mission.
Dhruva's satellites are expected to be launched on Isro's workhorse Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle . Nekkanti said his team is working closely with the space organisation for design approvals and testing of the satellites. If the process is successful, it will lead to the launch of Dhruva's first satellite in early 2016, with the second following soon after.
"We are building satellites in the 10-100 kg range, which can do the same thing as an 800-kg satellite. This is pure commercial grade," said Abhishek Raju, 30, the chief strategy officer of Dhruva.
"They have made a presentation to us some time back and have been asked to give a formal proposal to Isro," said Mylswamy Annadurai, project director at Isro Satellite Center, Bangalore While there are about 400 private companies that supply components to Isro, Dhruva Space will be the first to develop an entire satellite, according to the company's co-founders.
Dhruva was set up in 2012 by Nekkanti, the CEO, Narayan Prasad, his collegemate, and Raju. The three have firmed up collaborations with several industry organisations, including satellite company Berlin Space Technologies , Saber Astronautics in Australia and launch facilitation firm Earth2Orbit India . They have also roped in several former scientists at Isro as advisors.
Experts are of the view that small satellites are the key to the growth of the private space industry. SpaceWorks Enterprises, a space consultancy in Atlanta, estimates that about 2,750 nano or microsatellites will be launched in the next six years with a 15% increase in the commercial launch market.
"What was space-grade around 30 years ago is now commercial grade, and that's what Dhruva is following.
There, however, needs to be a solid infrastructure for private satellite launches," said KR Sridhara Murthi, a former MD of Isro's commercial arm, Antrix Corporation , and advisor to Dhruva Space.
The company says it uses 3D printing technology, advanced CNC machines and opensource architectures for the final integration of the spacecraft.
Raju said the average budget for a satellite developed by Isro —known for its frugal Mars mission that cost less than a Hollywood blockbuster —is about Rs 200-300 crore. "Unconventional techniques and higher risk do not mean quality compromises," said Raju.
Automatic Identification of Ships, disaster management, pollution monitoring and national security are the priority applications for the company.
Small satellites that weigh less than 100 kg are at present used as experimental functional substitutes for large satellites.
In India, students have built and launched small satellites, including Jugnu, which weighed 3 kg and was built at the IIT-Kanpur. Nekkanti was also part of a team at the SRM University in Chennai which built a 10-kg satellite with guidance from Isro in 2011.

Maoists kill 13 CRPF jawans in Chhattisgarh13 paramilitary troops dead in India Maoist attack
Associated Press –  Mon 1 Dec, 2014
Print
PATNA, India (AP) — At least 13 paramilitary troops were killed in an attack by Maoist rebels in central India on Monday, police said.
R.K. Vij, a top police official in Chhattisgarh state, said the attack took place in Sukma district, 385 kilometers (240 miles) south of Raipur, the state capital.
Troops from the Central Reserve Police Force were engaged in fighting the rebels in an area that is known to be their stronghold when they were surrounded by Maoists who opened indiscriminate fire, Vij said, adding that few other details were immediately available from the remote region.
The rebels have been called India's biggest internal security threat. They operate in 20 of India's 28 states and have thousands of fighters, according to the Home Ministry.
The rebels, who say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, have been fighting for more than three decades in central and eastern India, staging hit-and-run attacks against authorities as they demand a greater share of wealth from the area's natural resources and more jobs for farmers and the poor.
The rebels say they represent the poor living close to the land, including farmers and members of tribal groups who depend on forests for food, fuel and building materials for their thatched huts.

RBI policy review: Raghuram Rajan effects no interest rate cut; hope lost for lower EMIsGovt considering 6 FDI proposals in single-brand retail
Home and auto loans will not become cheaper as the Governor Raghuram Rajan-led Reserve Bank of India (RBI) kept the policy rate unchanged for the fifth time in a row today, but hinted at softening of stance “early next year” if inflation continues to abate and there is an improvement in fiscal health.
The decision to keep the short term lending (repo) rate unchanged at 8 per cent disappointed the industry which said RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan in his fifth bi-monthly policy statement could had been more accommodating to help prop up the sagging economy.
“A change in the monetary policy stance at the current juncture is premature. However, if the current inflation momentum and changes in inflationary expectations continue, and fiscal developments are encouraging, a change in the monetary policy stance is likely early next year, including outside the policy review cycle,” he said.
ANALYSTS’ COMMENTARY: ‘Change in stance by Raghuram Rajan’s RBI very heartening’
RBI POLICY REVIEW: HIGHLIGHTS
The repo rate continues to be at 8 per cent while the cash reserve ratio has also been retained at 4 per cent.
Following the policy announcement, most of the bankers said that there will be no change in lending and deposit rates for now.
United Bank of India Executive Director Deepak Narang said the margins of banks are already under pressure due to high level of non-performing assets (NPAs) or bad loans.
“So, I don’t see a cut in the interest rate at the moment,” he added.
Following the RBI stance, the BSE’s 30-share index Sensex closed at 28,444, down 115.61 points or 0.40 per cent.
On the inflation trajectory, Rajan said he expects it to ease further and average at the 6 per cent.
“Over the next 12-month period, inflation is expected to retain some momentum and hover around 6 per cent, except for seasonal movements, as the disinflation momentum works through,” he said in the bi-monthly review of the monetary policy.
Driven largely by a base-effect, the consumer price inflation for October had come in at 5.52 per cent, the fifth consecutive month that it declined.
Poor showing by agriculture and manufacturing sector pulled down the country’s economic growth rate to 5.3 per cent in the second quarter, as against 5.7 per cent in the April-June quarter of the current financial year.
Under its glide path, the RBI is targeting to get the CPI inflation at 8 per cent as of January 2015 and take it down to 6 per cent by January 2016. While the 2015 target is achievable, Rajan had in the last policy sounded concerned about the “upside risks” to the 2016 target.
Central forecast for retail inflation is revised downward to 6 per cent from 8 per cent for March 2015.
Calls for a rate cut had been growing in the run up to the policy announcement, with Finance Minister Arun Jaitley also pitching for lowering the cost of capital to boost growth.
However, the surprising rebound displayed with a 6.3 per cent growth in the core sector yesterday – indicating an uptick in factory output – had kept everybody guessing about the stance which Rajan adopts.
Additionally, the auto companies also reported an over 10 per cent growth in sales for November, after a dip in the preceding month, indicating a revival in the manufacturing sector. Among the eight core sectors, coal and power have done exceedingly well during the month.
The lobby calling for a rate cut had also been pointing to a continuous decline in global crude prices, which have come to a 5-year low of around USD 68 a barrel, which has the potential to reduce inflation in an oil-importing nation like India.
However, some experts also warn of uncertainty continuing over oil pricing, saying that any geo-political tension will send the prices up again.
India’s RBI leaves rates on hold, says could ease early 2015
(Reuters) The Reserve Bank of India held interest rates steady as widely expected at a policy review on Tuesday, and said it could ease monetary policy early next year provided inflationary pressures do not reappear and the government controls the fiscal deficit.
Uneasy over India’s weak recovery from its slowest phase of growth since the 1980s, the six-month-old government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi had been seen as favouring an early reduction in rates.
The finance ministry said later in a statement it looked forward to the RBI’s support in “the revival of growth and employment” while adding it would work with the RBI on reducing inflationary expectations and reviving investment and growth.
RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has resisted calls for rate cuts and earlier reiterated his view that containing inflation was a prerequisite for the economy.
“What again and again we have seen in India, and outside India also, is that the way to sustainable growth is to have moderate inflation,” Rajan told a news conference.
Forty-one of 45 economists polled by Reuters had forecast that the RBI would keep the repo rate at 8.00 percent, while four had expected a reduction of 25 basis points.
The RBI’s next policy review is in early February, and most analysts had expected the central bank would either cut interest rates then or wait until April.
“A change in the monetary policy stance at the current juncture is premature,” the RBI said in its statement.
“However, if the current inflation momentum and changes in inflationary expectations continue, and fiscal developments are encouraging, a change in the monetary policy stance is likely early next year, including outside the policy review cycle.”
Rajan told a teleconference with analysts that the central bank wants to be confident that underlying trends for non-food inflation were moving in the right direction before reducing interest rates.
India’s benchmark 10-year bond yield fell 5 basis points on the day to 8.01 percent as investors cheered the central bank’s more dovish stance.
ECONOMY NEEDS MORE THAN RATE CUT
In its statement, the RBI spoke of the need to revive capital investment, and called on the government, which will announce its budget in February, to “stay on course” to meet fiscal deficit targets. Those targets have been jeopardised by  weak tax revenue growth and the slow pace in selling off stakes in state-run companies to raise funds.
Data released on Friday showed economic growth slipped to 5.3 percent year-on-year in the July-September quarter, down from 5.7 percent in the previous quarter. India needs far faster growth to create jobs for all the young people joining its workforce in coming years.
“Things will not pick up just because of rate cuts,” said J. Venkatesan, an equity fund manger for Sundaram Asset Management in Chennai. “A strong reforms push is needed to revive economic growth.”
Helped by tumbling oil prices, India’s annual consumer price inflation (CPI) slowed to 5.52 percent in October, sharply down from a peak of 11.16 percent struck in November last year, but the RBI warned that it expected inflation to rise in December as a favourable base effect wanes.
The RBI has targeted CPI at 6 percent for January 2016, and the central bank said risks to the target “appear evenly balanced under the current policy stance”.
Rajan said if that target was achieved the RBI would then aim for a longer-term inflation target of 4 percent.
While there were few expectations that the RBI would cut interest rates this time, officials had told Reuters last week that Finance Minister Arun Jaitley would press Rajan for a reduction when they held a customary meeting before the policy review – though there was no confirmation that the meeting took place.
The central bank is not statutorily independent from the finance ministry, but it enjoys broad autonomy in setting monetary policy, though there are plans to amend the RBI Act and incorporate a monetary policy committee that gives voting rights to officials both within and outside the central bank.
“In the weeks ahead, the government and RBI will work towards a monetary policy framework that will help institutionalize the gains achieved on the inflation front, so as to reduce inflationary expectations and further support the revival of investment and growth,” the ministry said.
 

United Bank identifies UB Holdings as wilful defaulterUnited Bank identifies UB Holdings as wilful defaulter
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: December 2, 2014  | 16:18 IST
Kingfisher Airlines promoter Vijay Mallya
In fresh trouble for liquor baron Vijay Mallya, United Bank of India has identified United Breweries Holdings , the guarantor of grounded airline Kingfisher, as wilful defaulter.
The bank has already declared Kingfisher Airlines and its four directors, including Mallya, as wilful defaulters.
"We have identified United Breweries (UB) Holdings as wilful defaulter because company had the resources to repay the loan as guarantor of Kingfisher Airlines," United Bank of India (UBI) Executive Director Deepak Narang told PTI.
UB Holdings had additional resources available as per the balance-sheet of 2013-14, he said, adding, these funds could have been used for paying loans given to Kingfisher.
The bank issued notice to the UB Holdings and got a reply which was not satisfactory.
"We would take further action after due deliberations on the issue," he added.
In September this year, UBI became the first lender to declare debt-ridden Kingfisher Airlines, its promoter Vijay Mallya and other directors wilful defaulters as the company allegedly indulged in diversion of funds by opening multiple accounts.
The other directors declared as wilful defaulters by the Grievance Redressal Committee (GRC) of the bank are Ravi Nedungadi, Anil Kumar Ganguly and Subash Gupte.
Kingfisher Airlines and directors declared as wilful defaulters now won't be able to borrow from banks in the future. They would also lose director-level positions in companies and criminal proceeding could be initiated against them, if warranted, to recover the money.
The bank had first given notice to declare Kingfisher Airlines as wilful defaulter on May 28. However, the company approached Calcutta High Court against the notice.
A single bench dismissed the company's plea.
Subsequently, it approached double bench which upheld the single bench order on August 28.
UBI's exposure to Kingfisher Airlines was around Rs 350 crore as part of consortium led by State Bank of India.
The consortium of 17 banks has an outstanding debt of about Rs 6,521 crore from the now-grounded carrier. Outside the consortium, UBI gave about Rs 60 crore loan for pre-delivery payment.

Trashing India Inc’s incessant criticism that RBI is not reducing interest rates, Governor Raghuram Rajan today accused them of being myopic and asserted that the central bank is for the “strongest possible growth”.
“I think there is a misconception in corporate India that the central bank is not concerned about growth,” Rajan said and underlined that the fundamental way to get sustainable growth is to have moderate inflation.
Addressing the customary post-policy press briefing, Rajan said, “We are not talking about growth for this quarter. We are talking about years of sustainable growth. To get that you need to fight inflation, beat it and then you can get sustainable growth.”
Asserting that RBI is not against growth but wants the strongest possible growth, Rajan pointed to the incessant fight between the savers and producers and said, “The big fight between savers and producers has been that savers are seeing high inflation and so can’t save, whereas producers are seeing low inflation and say interest rate are so high and how can they invest.
“How do you bring these two together? By bringing inflation down. Otherwise, we are going to have this high inflation and low growth scenario again and again. And so, I think it is very shortsighted when people comment that you (RBI) are not helping growth this quarter,” the Governor said in combative tone.
India Inc and many political leaders have long been demanding a rate cut as growth has been trending down. The GDP grew at 5.3 per cent in the second quarter of this fiscal as against 5.7 per cent in the first quarter.
Rajan said RBI is also in the process of creating a framework which will make the sustainable growth possible.
“I would say bare with us (for some more time) and hopefully if we can reach there and stay there. We will produce many years of strong growth for corporate India,” Rajan said, adding that RBI has a projection for a steady pickup in growth going forward.

Sadhvi apologises for hate speech  but united Opposition guns for herComments
Minister of state for food processing industries Niranjan Jyoti Tuesday tendered an apology in Parliament for using abusive language at an election campaign in Delhi but failed to douse the opposition fire even as the Bharatiya Janata Party Tuesday said the issue should not be stretched.

On Monday, Jyoti had said people of Delhi must decide if they wanted a government of Ramzaadon (followers of Ram) or a government of those who are illegitimate.
Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said in Rajya Sabha the government did not support Jyoti's remark, but he also asked the Opposition to "maintain decorum."
Naqvi said those in the government and the opposition should use dignified language and in the past UPA ministers too had crossed the line many times.
As Rajya Sabha session was adjourned for a third time, finance minister Arun Jaitley said Jyoti's comments were "improper and unacceptable".
He said since the minister had apologised and withdrawn her statement, "what happens outside isn't within domain of this House".
But BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra seemed to be defending her by saying it was a "slip of tongue" and the issue should not be politicised.
The saffron party also hit out at Congress, saying several of its leaders too have made objectionable remarks in the past.
"But have they ever been asked to resign? When did Congress sack them from the party? And they are called experienced leaders while Sadhvi Niranjan has become MP for the first time," UP BJP chief Laxmikant Bajpai said.
According to reports, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked party MPs to abstain from addressing the nation and also condemned the comments made by Jyoti.
Modi asked the MPs to avoid making uncalled for statements at the parliamentary board meeting held ahead of Parliament session on Tuesday.
Opposition demands resignation
The issue rocked both the Houses as agitated opposition MPs disrupted proceedings, seeking an explanation from the Prime Minister and demanding an apology from Jyoti, who joined the Narendra Modi's cabinet early last month.
The remarks drew the ire of Opposition which protested in Parliament following which Jyoti expressed "deep regret" and apologised for her actions saying she did not intend to hurt anyone's feelings.
"My intention was not to hurt anyone. If my speech outside the House has hurt anyone, I express my deep regrets," Jyoti said in Lok Sabha.
She said if certain words spoken by her outside the House have hurt someone, she is ready to take back her words and offer regrets. She also said she is ready to seek an apology.
The Opposition, however, refused to accept her apology and said she must resign or should be removed from her post.
Drama in House
As soon as Lok Sabha met for the day, Mallikarjun Kharge, leader of the Congress, took up the issue with Speaker Sumitra Mahajan.
Kharge said the "objectionable" language used by Jyoti had created tension at a time when there had been quite a few communal riots.
Several Congress and Trinamool Congress members, too, rushed to the Well, shouting slogans.
Both Houses saw brief adjournments over the protests, even as Mahajan cautioned all members to be mindful of their speech.
"The Prime Minister should give an explanation," Congress leader Anand Sharma said.
Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati said the minister's remarks were against the secular ethos espoused by the Constitution and do not behold a person occupying a constitutional post.
The BJP should sack her, she said.
Mayawati and CPI(M) MP Sitaram Yechury demanded that an FIR be filed against Jyoti.
The Congress alleged that Jyoti had insulted the people of Delhi and she should issue an apology while the Aam Aadmi Party said it was the BJP's real face.
"The divisive thinking and divisive politics of the BJP has been exposed," Congress leader Ambika Soni said.
Manish Sisodia of Aam Aadmi Party said, "This is the real character of BJP. Their language shows what kind of work they are doing at the Centre and what kind of work they will do for Delhi."
Members of Congress, TMC, SP and other opposition parties rushed to the Well during the uproar over her remarks leading to four adjournments in Rajya Sabha and one in Lok Sabha during pre-lunch sitting.
Later, outside Parliament, the minister was asked about demands for her resignation.
"I have apologised and I have nothing else to say," she replied.
Following the controversy, Jyoti said, "I did not take name of any particular individual, community or party. I was talking about separatist parties and leaders who think of dividing the country..."
She later clarified her statement was for those who didn't believe in Ram and unified India, adding her remarks must not be given any communal overtone.
"Those who have sold the country, made it bankrupt, people will not voter for such people. Is it a crime to talk about Ram? How can talking about Ram be communal?"
"Muslims offer namaz in mosques, we do no object. Christians pray in churches, we do not object. Then talking about Ram should not be termed as communal. And those who call me communal, I would say what could be more communal than this."
"Do you want a government of people who believe in Ram, a government that believes in people. And i would like to say one more thing, be it Hindu or a Christian in the country, he is an offspring of Ram. And those who refuse to believe this, will never believe in this country also," she said.
Jyoti is credited with helping the ruling BJP make inroads among the Dalit and backward classes in the politically crucial state of Uttar Pradesh.
She is among the six BJP MPs drafted into the party's campaign for the Delhi polls due early next year.

Of the 20 constituencies that went to the polls, 70 per cent are in the Maoist-affected areas.
Long queues of voters, including women and the youth, could be seen at various polling stations, especially in Maoist-affected constituencies.

Over 44 lakh voters decided the fate of 223 candidates in the fray, including former chief ministers Arjun Munda and Madhu Koda.
The electoral fate of three Jharkhand Ministers — Banna Gupta and Geetasri Oraon of the Congress and Champai Soren of the JMM — were also sealed.
Barring a few cases of defective EVM machines at some places, polling was by and large incident-free, poll officials said.

Investing.com - Investing.com - Natural gas carried Monday's losses into Tuesday after updated weather-forecasting models continued to call for mild temperatures to hover over the U.S. in the coming days, which should curb demand for heating.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, natural gas futures for delivery in January were down 3.18% at $3.880 per million British thermal units during U.S. trading. The commodity hit a session low of $3.862, and a high of $4.031.
The January contract settled down 1.89% on Monday to end at $4.007 per million British thermal units.
Natural gas futures were likely to find support at $3.620 per million British thermal units, the low from Oct. 28, and resistance at $4.529, last Wednesday's high.
Forecasts for milder temperatures to stick around for the coming days once a cold snap pushes out pressured prices lower,.
"By later this week temperatures will become seasonally stratified from north to south through the weekend with chilly air across the far northern U.S. and very mild temperatures over the southern U.S. There will be additional weather systems to follow next week that still have potential to tap into much colder Canadian air, although the latest weather and climate data suggests the potential for frigid Arctic air is decreasing," Natgasweather.com reported in its Tuesday midday update.
While cooler weather may make its return, most of the U.S. will continue to see mild mercury readings.
"Simply put; weather patterns are not looking cold enough to expect future draws to be close to normal due to much of the U.S. becoming unseasonably warm in a mild but active pattern. This clearly would provide bearish weather sentiment for the nat gas markets," Natgasweather.com added.
Bearish speculators are betting on the mild weather to dampen demand for the heating fuel. The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said last week that natural gas storage in the U.S. fell by 162 billion cubic feet in the week before, surpassing expectations for a decline of 150 billion.
The five-year average change for the week is a drop of 6 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.432 trillion cubic feet as of last week, 9.2% below year-ago levels and nearly 10.4% below the five-year average for this time of year.
The Energy Information Administration's next storage report is slated for release on Thursday, Dec. 4, with analysts expecting a decline of 47 billion cubic feet for the week ending Nov. 28.
The five-year average change for the week is a decrease of 50 billion cubic feet. Stockpiles fell by 141 billion in the same week a year earlier.
Elsewhere on the NYMEX, light sweet crude oil futures for delivery in January were down 1.75% at $67.79 a barrel, while heating oil for January delivery were down 1.82% at $2.1721 per gallon.

Six small-cap stocks mutual funds are placing their bets onequities
(Small and mid-cap stocks…)
As frontline stocks trade at steep valuations, domestic fund managers are scanning the lesser-known universe of mid- and small-cap stocks to identify winners. In November, domestic mutual funds bought shares of lesserknown companies such as Atul Auto, Deccan Cements, Mayur Uniquoters, Rane Holdings, Shakti Pumps and TRF, which are tracked by very fewer analysts.
Small-cap and mid-cap stocks have risen sharply since the beginning of the year after a long lull. While Sensex rose 32% between January and October, the BSE Mid-cap index surged 47% and the BSE Small-cap index by 67%. This has boosted the performance of mid-cap and small-cap funds, which has, in turn, compelled retail investors to pump in money into mid- and small-cap schemes. However, overall mutual fund investment in equities has declined to Rs 1,677 crore in November compared with an average of Rs 5,000 crore per month between June and October.
Atul Auto CMP: Rs 554.60
WHO BOUGHT: Birla Mutual Fund
HOW MUCH: 5 lakh shares
LIKELY TRIGGERS: Atul Auto, a three-wheeler vehicle maker in the cargo segment, has been rerated since September 2013.
The stock, which has risen over 267% so far this year, is trading at 31 times one-year trailing earnings. Despite the surge, Atul Auto shares still have some steam left in them thanks to the better return ratios than some of its large-cap peers, said analysts. "If its entry into metros and export markets proves successful, it could jump into the next growth phase much ahead of the industry," said Rohan Korde, analyst, Anand Rathi.
Mayur Uniquoters CMP: Rs 430
WHO BOUGHT: DSP BlackRock Mutual Fund
HOW MUCH: 2.50 lakh shares
LIKELY TRIGGERS: A manufacturer of raw materials used in automobile seat covers, footwear, furnishing and upholstery, Mayur Uniquoters has gained 154% since January. The stock is trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of 16.5 times 2016-17 estimated earnings and 21.7 times 2015-16 estimated earnings. Sudeep Anand, analyst, IDBI Capital, said, "Earnings CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) of over 25% over the next three years with a healthy return ratio adds to our confi dence in the company."
Shakti Pumps (India) CMP: Rs 205.10
WHO BOUGHT: Franklin Templeton Mutual
HOW MUCH: 3.35 lakh shares
LIKELY TRIGGERS: It is one of the largest players in India's fragmented Rs 2,300-crore agriculture pumps market.
"While exports should grow at a decent clip, we expect domestic revenue growth to pick up driven by the anticipated shift in market share," said Abhinav Sharma of HDFC Securities. "At 13.7 times trailing 12 months EPS, we believe the stock is reasonably valued, given the huge opportunity available."
Deccan Cements CMP: Rs 369.30
WHO BOUGHT: UTI Mutual Fund
HOW MUCH: 1.5 lakh shares
LIKELY TRIGGERS: The share has risen about 130% so far in 2014 on hopes the creation of the new state of Telangana will lead to new infrastructure projects, boosting demand for cement.
The Hyderabad-based company has reduced its debt in the last four years. Its debtto-equity ratio has dropped from 1.93 times in 2009-10 to 0.89 times in 2013-14. A healthy balance sheet will boost Deccan Cements' growth in a robust economic environment, said Ashika Stock Broking.
Rane Holding CMP: Rs 677.50
WHO BOUGHT: Sundaram Mutual Fund
HOW MUCH: 1.86 lakh shares
LIKELY TRIGGERS: A holding entity of Rane Group, which makes auto components, the company owns four subsidiary companies, including Rane Madras, Rane Brake and Rane Engine Valve, three joint venture companies and two associate companies. After a couple of patchy years, the group is looking to turn around. Analysts said the stock is not cheap at 42 times one-year trailing earnings but growth rates are steady. The company's sales have grown at about 23% CAGR over the last fi ve years. Profi ts have risen 24% CAGR during the same period.
TRF CMP: Rs 387.80
WHO BOUGHT: Sundaram Mutual Fund
HOW MUCH: 3.5 lakh shares
LIKELY TRIGGERS: A Tata group company that makes machines for construction & agriculture industries, the company did not have any foreign institutional investors as on September 30. TRF reported a consolidated net loss of Rs 28 crore for the year ended March due to decline in project orders. Investors and analysts feel the company would be a turnaround story once the economy recovers and orders start fl owing in.

 Energy Shares Lead Wall Street Higher; Telecoms SlipYou are here: Home Market
Dow Jones Hits Record High as Energy Stocks Gain
Reuters | Updated On: December 03, 2014 08:13 (IST)
Oil Slumps Near $59 for First Time Since 2009 on Oversupply
New York: US stocks rose on Tuesday as energy stocks led the S&P 500 and Dow, while Biogen's rally on news about an experimental treatment for Alzheimer's disease topped gains at the Nasdaq.
The day's gains were broad, with nine of the 10 S&P 500 industry sectors higher. The only group to fall was telecoms, down 1.8 per cent with AT&T down 2.2 per cent at $34.29 and Verizon down 1.8 per cent at $49.11. Sprint announced it will cut in half the monthly price of service for Verizon and AT&T customers who switch to Sprint.
Energy shares on the S&P 500 rose 1.3 per cent even as crude oil prices resumed their fall. US crude fell 2.4 per cent to near a five-year low while Brent lost 2.3 per cent.
Exxon Mobil and Chevron were among the largest gainers on both the Dow and the S&P, up about 2 per cent each.
"The market is sniffing out a bottom in the underlying commodity and we are seeing a bounce in energy stocks from having been oversold in the last month or so," said John Manley, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in New York.
"It's in no one's interest for oil to go any lower; not in ours, or OPEC's," he said, adding that it is still a big benefit for consumers but the marginal gain with even lower gas would not be much bigger.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 102.75 points, or 0.58 per cent, to 17,879.55, a record high. The S&P 500 gained 13.11 points, or 0.64 per cent, to 2,066.55 and the Nasdaq Composite added 28.46 points, or 0.6 per cent, to 4,755.81.
Carmaker shares advanced as the top six automakers sold more cars and trucks in November than analysts expected. GM gained 1 percent to $33.26 and Fiat Chrysler gained 3 per cent to $13.09.
Biogen Idec advanced 6.4 per cent to $328.27. The company is planning a late-stage trial of its experimental treatment for Alzheimer's disease after the drug significantly improved cognition in a small early-stage study.
Avanir Pharmaceuticals was among the most traded stocks on the Nasdaq, rising 12.8 per cent to $16.92. Japanese drugmaker Otsuka Holdings plans to buy it for about $3.5 billion.
About two issues advanced for every decliner on both the NYSE and Nasdaq.
The S&P 500 posted 89 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite set 102 new highs and 95 new lows.
About 6.6 billion shares changed hands on US exchanges, according to BATS Global Markets data, above the daily average last month of about 6.17 billion.

G.W. Parkway reopens following sinkhole repairBy Julie Zauzmer December 2 Follow @JulieZauzmer
The George Washington Memorial Parkway was reopened Tuesday night to southbound travel after repair of a large sinkhole which shut down the lanes at Route 123 since Monday night.
However, the U.S. Park Police said that one southbound lane of the parkway remained closed at Windy Run. Sgt. Lelani Woods said it would reopen at 4 a.m. Wednesday.
On Monday night, a hole which U.S. Park Police said measured 10 feet by 5 feet opened up in the road. Officials said that the cold, rainy conditions made the repair work slower, and crews worked throughout the day and night on Tuesday to fix and fill the hole.
The road closure clogged traffic during the Tuesday morning rush hour and throughout the day Tuesday. Officials estimated that 100,000 vehicles were affected.
The precise cause of the sinkhole was not known.

India tablet market clocks strongest growth in Q3India's tablet market clocks strongest growth in Q3
IANS     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 29, 2014  | 14:15 IST
(Photo: Reuters)
Fuelled by festive buying and strengthening commercial demand, India's tablet market reported its strongest third quarter growth so far during July-September 2014.
According to a report by International Data Corporation (IDC) on Friday, tablet market shipments in India witnessed a strong quarter-on-quarter growth of 10 per cent making it a 0.94-million-unit market.
"The initial phase of impulsive buying seems to have faded, as the consumers are more aware of the use case of tablets now. Therefore, the current size of the market looks more realistic and stable," Tanvi Mann, market analyst, IDC India said.
Samsung led the tablet market in India, followed by Micromax and iBall.
With more than 90 per cent market share in third quarter, Android is expected to dominate the market in the foreseeable future as well, IDC said, adding: "Windows-based tablets priced under $200 (Rs.12,390) are expected to accelerate the adoption rate, albeit from a low base."
"Due to continuous onslaught from the "Phablets" (which IDC defines as 5.5 inches-6.99 inches screen size smartphones), small screen tablets are taking a hit and there is more uptake on tablets which are screen-sized between 8-9 inches. This has, however, led to an overall improvement of the average selling price for the category," Kiran Kumar, research manager, client devices, IDC India said.
Owing to seasonality, there will be lesser intake in fourth quarter (October-December) 2014, IDC predicted.
For 2015, however, the commercial segment is likely to grow in comparison to a stable consumer market. "Government projects and government-aided education projects should remain key to the growth in the commercial tablets," it said.
"We are likely to see increased activity by PC OEMs in the tablets space with a focus on the 7-inch and 8-inch form factor," Mann added.

Black Friday Weekend Sales TankBlack Friday Weekend Slows Down As Allure Fades
 |  By                                                                      ANNE D'INNOCENZIO

Black Friday shoppers leave the Target store in Fairfax, Virginia, on November 28, 2014. Black Friday, the biggest US shopping 'holiday,' kicked off with expectations that lower gasoline prices and higher consumer confidence could mean better year-end retail sales than last year. But there was little sign of the buying fever of years past, after many retailers started Black Friday sales early, turning Thursday's Thanksgiving Day holiday into what the industry has dubbed 'Gray Thursday.'

NEW YORK (AP) — Black Friday fatigue is setting in.
Early discounting, more online shopping and a mixed economy meant fewer people shopped over Thanksgiving weekend, the National Retail Federation said Sunday.
Overall, 133.7 million people shopped in stores and online over the four-day weekend, down 5.2 percent from last year, according to a survey of 4,631 people conducted by Prosper Insights & Analytics for the trade group.
Total spending for the weekend is expected to fall 11 percent to $50.9 billion from an estimated $57.4 billion last year, the trade group estimated.
Part of the reason is that Target, J.C. Penney, Macy's, Wal-Mart and other major retailers pushed fat discounts as early as Halloween. Some opened stores even earlier on Thanksgiving. All that stole some thunder from Black Friday and the rest of the weekend.
Still, the preliminary data makes retailers worried that shoppers remain frugal despite improving employment and falling gas prices.
Matt Shay, the trade group's CEO, said he thinks people benefiting from the recovery may not feel the need to fight crowds to get the deepest discount on a TV or toaster. And those who feel like the recession never ended may not have the money and will stretch out what they spend through Christmas.
And shoppers are still feeling the effects of high food prices and stagnant wages.
"While they're more optimistic, they're very cautious," Shay said. "If the deals are not right for them, they're not going to spend."
Bottom line: Expect more deep discounts, all season long.
"Every day will be Black Friday. Every minute will be Cyber Monday," he said.
That could be what it takes to get shoppers to open their wallets for the holiday shopping season, which accounts for about 20 percent of annual retail sales.
Besides economic factors, people are becoming more discerning when they shop. Armed with smartphones and price-comparison apps, they know what's a good deal — and what's not.
Kimani Brown, 39, of New York City, was among the Black Friday defectors. After four years of braving the crowds, the sales failed to lure him out this year.
"I consider myself a smart shopper. And it's not as alluring as it used to be," Brown said. "It's a marketing tool, and I don't want to be pulled into it."
He also said the frenzy pushed him to overspend, and he paid the price in January on his credit card statement.
Instead, he said he will look online Monday, the online shopping day often called Cyber Monday.
Some who went shopping on Thanksgiving felt they were doing it against their will. Cathyliz Lopez of New York City said she felt forced to shop on the holiday.
"It's ruining the spirit of Thanksgiving," the 20-year-old said Thursday. "But I was checking all the ads, and the best deals were today."
The National Retail Federation is still predicting a 4.1 percent increase in sales for the season. That would be the highest increase since the 4.8 percent gain in 2011.
Some stores and malls had reason to be optimistic.
Dan Jasper, a spokesman at Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, said customer counts are up 5 to 6 percent for the four-day weekend. One plus: Shoppers were buying more for themselves, a sign of optimism.
"They felt confident in the economy," he said.
CEOs at Target and Toys R Us said they saw shoppers not just focusing on the doorbuster deals but throwing extra items in their carts.
Macy's CEO Terry Lundgren told The Associated Press on Friday that he's hoping lower gas prices will help spending.
"There's reason to believe that confidence should continue to grow. That should be good for discretionary spending," he said.
Some of those discretionary dollars are migrating online.
Target said Thanksgiving saw a 40 percent surge in online sales and was its biggest online sales day ever. And Wal-Mart reported Thanksgiving was its second-highest online day ever, topped only by Cyber Monday last year.
From Nov. 1 through Friday, $22.7 billion has been spent online, a 15 percent increase from last year, according to research firm comScore. On Thanksgiving, online sales surged 32 percent, while Black Friday online sales jumped 26 percent.
In stores, shoppers spent $9.1 billion on Black Friday, according to research firm ShopperTrak, down 7 percent from last year. That was partly due to a 24 percent surge in Thanksgiving sales, to $3.2 billion.
ShopperTrak estimated that in-store sales for the two days combined slipped half a percent to $12.29 billion.

Rs 900-crore scam: Engineer may fake divorce to get off hookPrint
NEW DELHI: Reports coming in suggest that Uttar Pradesh government engineer Yadav Singh, now an accused in two high-profile corruption cases, is mulling desperate measures to come out unscathed from the vortex of allegations surrounding him. So much so, sources say Singh is preparing to plead he and his wife, Kusumlata, are divorced because last week’s income tax raids involve charges against two companies where she served as director.
“Most of his illegally earned assets were in the name of his wife till 2013. However, later on, these assets were shifted in the name of some shell companies. Singh is in touch with his chartered accountants, who have suggested that he prove to the authorities that he shares no relationship with Kusumlata,” a source said.
“He may forge documents to prove that they terminated their marriage,” the source added.
Interestingly, Singh’s wife was with him when a team of income tax investigators conducted an incriminating raid at his house in Noida’s Sector 51 last week that yielded crores in cash and other valuables.
The raid at the Singhs’ posh bungalow was conducted in connection with charges of tax evasion by Meenu Creations and McConn Infra Private Limited, which are suspected to have purchased land at throwaway prices from Noida Authority and sold it at market prices. Singh’s involvement is yet to be proved.
“He knows how to protect himself and also his money. Although people are making a hue and cry over his illegal wealth, we know that it is not going to harm him in any way,” a source said. “Very soon, the I-T department will finish its work and then a subsequent inquiry will be started to save him,” the source added.
His wife Kusumlata served as director in two firms under probe.
Noida Authority attempts damage control
Back in the thick of a storm that threatens to corrode its image, the Noida Authority is working overtime to dissociate itself from Yadav Singh’s alleged dirty deeds.
The civic agency announced on Sunday that it has lowered the threshold for the conduct of e-tendering— the process of managing tenders electronically for greater transparency and efficiency— to limit the scope for deceitful transactions.
The agency currently opts for e-tendering for projects worth over Rs 2 crore.
From now, though, any project worth over Rs 50 lakh will be handed out via the electronic procedure.
“This has become a very important case. The I-T department has found many irregularities vis-a-vis his stint at the authority,” a senior Noida Authority official said. “Going forward, we will float tenders for projects worth over Rs 50 lakh online to ensure we have each and every transaction on the record,” he added.
Noida Authority engineer Yadav Singh has been accused of handing out contracts for projects worth over ` 950 crore without issuing tenders.
In raids on his house and other property on Thursday and Friday, the Income Tax department found unaccounted for assets worth crores. Officials recovered Rs 10 crore in cash and 2 kg of diamond (worth at least Rs 100 crore) and gold jewellery.
Singh was relieved from his charge as chief engineer on Saturday and attached to the personnel department pending completion of the probe.
A Rs 900-crore scam
Engineer Yadav Singh’s corruption has been so massive that Income Tax officials are yet to drill out the full detail of his ill-gotten wealth even after twenty raids. 
The Income Tax department on Friday raided his residence at Noida’s Sector 51 and found cash worth Rs 10 crore and diamond and gold jewellery of around 2 kg. 
Singh, meanwhile, was shunted out of the post of Chief Project Engineer and will no longer be looking after the three authorities of Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway. A red-faced Uttar Pradesh government has shifted him to Noida’s CEO office till investigations against him are completed. 
On Thursday, the department had found unaccounted assets at the residence and offices of Singh and also unearthed 40 fake companies running under his wife Kusumlata’s name. Sources in the department say Singh’s scam runs over Rs 900 crore. 
A team of around 100 officials conducted search operations at 20 buildings located in Noida, Ghaziabad and Delhi. The drive will continue for a few more days. 
“We have found evidence to prove that Singh has unaccounted assets. We have seized laptops and documents. We will reveal all details in a day or two," said Krishna Saini, Director (Investigation), Income Tax department, Uttar Pradesh.
The team also sealed 13 lockers on Friday that belonged to Singh and his associates. It also found that two firms—Mamta and Meenu creations—were involved in managing Singh’s unaccounted-for money. 
Web of deceit
The probe team has discovered that Meenu Creation Private Ltd and McConn Infra Private Limited were involved not only in exporting garments but also in buying land at throwaway prices and selling them at prevailing market rates. Singh allegedly misused his power in these transactions.
Sources said Singh was being interrogated by an I-T team in Delhi. They have detained Anil Peshawari, his business partner, to interrogate him. 
“We have found Singh has invested in 35 fake Kolkata-based companies. We are yet to substantiate how he has invested the money. Singh used to get 5% as commission on every contract that he awarded to a contractor,” said another official.
Officials said this looks like a clear case of black money and fraud. 
Saini said that some officers of Noida Authority would also be grilled in this connection. “It is a survey and search operation in which over 130 I-T officials and an equal number of policemen have been deployed. We have also recovered documents of unnamed properties. We cannot give out more details because the probe is on,” Saini said. 
Digging deep
Sources said Singh had shares in many real estate companies of Noida and Greater Noida and had a team of contractors who used to work for him.
Although it was out in the public domain since 2007 that Yadav Singh was a corrupt officer who was involved in flouting every land deal norm, the Mayawati government between 2007 and 2012 and the present Akhilesh Yadav government had allegedly favoured him.
Despite facing corruption charges, Mayawati had given him charge of all infrastructure works in Noida. Flouting all norms, he had entered an agreement with several companies for Rs 954-crore projects within eight days in December 2011. In many cases, the deals were sealed without issuance of any tender.
Singh was suspended by the Akhilesh Yadav government in June 2012 from the post of Chief Maintenance Engineer of Noida Authority on charges of corruption.
However, a few months later, he was made Chief Engineer (Second) of Noida. The SP government had also given him the charge of Chief Project Officer of Yamuna Expressway Authority. He was practically exercising the powers of a Chief Engineer at all these places.
Yadav Singh and his wife's case brings to mind tainted Madhya Pradesh’s IAS couple Arvind and Tinoo Joshi's example. In 2010, an I-T raid led to the initial recovery of Rs 3 crore in cash. Further investigations revealed the MP cadre bureaucrats were in possession of assets disproportionate to their known sources of income which ran into Rs 360 crore.

RBI policy: Growth to revive soon on lower rates, says M&M
Combating immense pressure on both bankers and corporates’ front, the Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan maintained status quo in today’s bi-monthly policy.
Post your opinion here
 
Moneycontrol Bureau
12:20pm: VS Parthasarathy, CFO,  M&M says that while the Q2 GDP was reasonable there is a dire need for momentum to go forward.
“While there HSBC PMI index is positive, there isn’t any decent demand pull. So, sooner the rate cut comes in, better the situation of the industry.”
12:17pm: P Pradeep Kumar, MD- Corporate Banking,  State Bank of India feels there is nothing in this policy that will enable them to drop rates immediately.
The effect of this will take sometime, he says adding, "We had anticipated this and because of the lower inflation, we had already revised our pricing for deposits in the one to three-year tenure as also the shorter tenure.Banking system will not be able to cut rates in a couple of months. Some banks have already reduced deposit rates. Those banks which have reduced deposit rates approximately a month back may be willing to look at a rate cut after a couple of months but most of the banks in the system have not reduced the deposit rates. So they may find it extremely difficult to cut lending rates.”
12:15 pm: Jayesh Mehta of Bank of America says he is expecting the central bank to cut rates to the tune of  75-100 basis points (bps) in CY2015.
12:14pm: Sonal Verma of Nomura expects Raghuram Rajan to cut interest rates to a maximum of 50 basis points (bps) in 2015.
"RBI also reiterated that government has more or less accepted the 4, plus minus 2 percent target is important in terms of anchoring the space that will be available for rate cut. So, 50 basis point is quite reasonable in this inflation targeting framework," she says.
12:12pm: Nirmal Jain of IIFL says he expects the earliest rate cut in February 2015.
“The central bank is comfortable with the bond yields and commodity prices, They want to be very sure that when they start the rate cut cycle inflation doesn’t move up and they don’t have to reverse it later.”
12:10pm: C Rangarajan says the central bank should bring down its inflation target for January to 5 percent and adds that the real rate interest at 2 percent is at appropriate levels.
12:05: Sonal Verma of Nomura says though the Guv has hinted at intra-policy rate changes, the most likely time of a rate cut is now in April 2015.
11:55: On the scrapping of the 80:20 gold scheme, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan says the decision was a reasonable one.
“While there is a natural demand for gold due to weddings, jewellery, etc, hopefully, the performance of financial assets will convince investors to park funds in other investment opportunities,” says Rajan
11:47: RBI Guv Rajan says the country’s economy will be out of the woods only when investments into the country sees a significant pick up.
“The railways provides a massive investment potential. There is huge interest in defence production too. So we need to see stronger demand to overcome the excess capacity that exists currently,” he explains.
11:35: On the announcement that the central bank could change rates even outside the policy cycle, Rajan said he is ready to keep the risk on when the RBI will take a call on the same.
“Once we have enough information, we will make a move. If the information comes in between policy cycles, we’ll act on it. We just want to say that we are alert on the data points,” adds Rajan.
11:20: In its statement, the RBI has said, “Still weak demand and the rapid pace of recent disinflation are factors supporting monetary accommodation. However, the weak transmission by banks of the recent fall in money market rates into lending rates suggests monetary policy shifts will primarily have signaling effects for a while. Nevertheless, these signaling effects are likely to be large because the Reserve Bank has repeatedly indicated that once the monetary policy stance shifts, subsequent policy actions will be consistent with the changed stance. There is still some uncertainty about the evolution of base effects in inflation, the strength of the on-going disinflationary impulses, the pace of change of the public’s inflationary expectations, as well as the success of the government’s efforts to hit deficit targets."
11:16: RBI Governor Rajan says the change in monetary policy stance now would be premature and it is likely in early-2015 if inflation eases.
"A change in the monetary policy stance at the current juncture is premature. However, if the current inflation momentum and changes in inflationary expectations continue, and fiscal developments are encouraging, a change in the monetary policy stance is likely early next year, including outside the policy review cycle," reads the RBI statement.
11:13: Jayesh Mehta, Managing Director & Country Treasurer, Bank of America says no one expected a rate cut in this monetary policy so, this doesn’t come as any surprise. The next hurdle, he adds, is the November inflation.
“Market was balanced as nobody expected a rate cut. With a dovish tone, policy is completely as per expected lines,” he adds.
11:10am: P Pradeep Kumar, MD- Corporate Banking, State Bank of Indiafeels there is nothing in this policy that will enable teh bank to drop rates immediately. The effect of this will take sometime, he says adding, “We had anticipated this and because of the lower inflation, we had already revised our pricing for deposits in the one to three-year tenure as also the shorter tenure.”
11:07: Sajjid Chinoy of JP Morgan says this monetary policy is pragmatic and data-contingent.
“We expected the RBI to wait for Budget. So the rate cut may come in March, it may not necessarily wait for April,” he says.
11:05 am: The central bank has said that the risk to its January 2016 target of 6 percent is now evenly balanced and the country’s GDP is seen at 5.5 percent in 2015-16.
11:00am: Combating immense pressure on both bankers and corporates’ front, the Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan maintained status quo in today’s bi-monthly policy.
The repo rate, or the rate at which RBI extends short-term loans to banks, stands unchanged at eight percent while the reverse repo rate is seven percent. The cash reserve ratio (CRR) for banks has been fixed at four per cent.
10:55am: Samiran Chakraborty of Standard Chartered Bank says the RBI is likely to be in wait-and-watch mode before taking any call on the policy rates.
10:50 am: Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan will be announcing the bi-monthly policy in just a few minutes.
Most bankers and economists polled by CNBC-TV18 expect Rajan to keep policy rates unchanged yet again today. Only 5 percent expect a 25 bps rate cut this time. With consumer price inflation falling to 5.5 percent in October and crude falling to a four-year low, most respondents agreed the RBI could start cutting rates earlier than previously expected.

Infosys shares tumbled 2.18 per cent on Tuesday as the stock price factored in the issuance of bonus shares on Wednesday to the existing investors.
Traders said that profit-booking pulled down the scrip as the IT major went ex-bonus.
Stocks of Infosys fell by 2.18 per cent to Rs 2,127 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) on Tuesday, while at the National Stock Exchange (NSE), it was down over 2 per cent to Rs 2,127.
The bonus issue was announced in October, when Infosys reported its second quarter earnings . It had recommended a bonus issue of one equity share for every share held.
The issuing company fixes a particular date, which is termed as record date, when the investor must own shares in order to be eligible to participate in events like receiving dividend, bonus shares.
Infosys had informed domestic bourses in November that the company had fixed record date as December 3, 2014 for the purpose of allotment of bonus shares/stock dividend.
Bonus shares are free shares given to the existing shareholders of a company.

Guns and Roses - Reenacting the historic Battle of Austerlitz
The Battle of Austerlitz, also known as the Battle of the Three Emperors, took place in 1805 between a French army commanded by Emperor Napoleon I, and a Russo-Austrian army. It was one of Napoleon's greatest victories. The battle was fought on December 2, 1805 and saw Napoleon decisively defeat the combined armies of Russia and Austria. After more than two centuries, the battleground remains mostly unchanged since that historic day. The rolling countryside where Napoleon hid his troops remains almost the same. The reenactment of the battle, which takes place here, finds plenty of enthusiastic takers and the atmosphere is reminiscent of a carnival.

What Raghuram Rajan Said at RBI Policy Meet Today
NDTV | Updated On: December 02, 2014 12:32 (IST)
China December Industrial Activity Shrinks for First Time in 7 Months
The Reserve Bank of India held interest rates steady as widely expected at its policy review on Tuesday. However, Governor Raghuram Rajan signaled a softening of stance on interest rates, which could pave the way for a rate cut early next year.
Here are five key things Dr Rajan said in Tuesday's policy announcement:
1) The RBI could cut interest rates early next year if inflation eases further and if fiscal developments are encouraging, the central bank said. A rate cut may happen even outside the policy review cycle, the RBI said.
2) Headline inflation has been receding steadily and current readings are below the January 2015 target of 8 per cent as well as the January 2016 target of 6 per cent.
3) The Governor said the RBI does not intend to flip-flop on policy and is in discussions with the government for a new monetary framework which it hopes to finalise shortly.
4) Some easing of monetary conditions has already taken place, but this has yet to be transmitted by banks into lower lending rates, the RBI said. Dr Rajan later clarified that the RBI is not asking banks to cut rates.
5) The RBI is not against growth, but there is a need to create a framework for it, Dr Rajan said. We are looking at years of sustainable growth by beating inflation, he added.

Gold prices soar by Rs 840 in biggest single-day gainbullion
(After losing Rs 730…)
NEW DELHI: Posting this year's biggest single-day rise of Rs 840, gold today regained the Rs 27,000 per ten gram level after a gap of over one month in the national capital, tracking rebounds in global markets.
In addition, pick-up in domestic demand from jewellers and retailers for the wedding season also buoyed sentiment.
After losing Rs 730 in last six sessions after the RBI eased imports curbs by scrapping 80:20 scheme, gold staged a strong comeback by rising Rs 840 to close at Rs 27,040 per ten grams, a level last seen on October 30.
Silver also recorded a significant gain of Rs 2,700 to Rs 37,000 per kg on increased offtake by industrial units and coin makers.
Sentiment bolstered after gold surged by 3.69 per cent, its biggest gain since September 19, to USD 1,218.10 an ounce in New York yesterday, as rebound in crude price revived demand for the precious metal as stores of value, bullion traders said.
Globally, silver also surged 7.3 per cent to USD 16.69 an ounce yesterday, the highest gain since September 2013.
Besides, rising domestic demand from jewellers and retailers for the ongoing wedding season too influenced precious metal prices, they said.
In Delhi, gold of 99.9 and 99.5 per cent purity zoomed up by Rs 840 each to Rs 27,040 and Rs 26,840 per ten grams respectively.
Sovereign moved up by Rs 100 to Rs 23,700 per piece of eight gram.
Following gold, silver ready spurted by Rs 2,700 to Rs 37,000 per kg and weekly-based delivery by Rs 2,420 to Rs 36,340 per kg.
Silver coins recovered sharply by Rs 3,000 to Rs 61,000 for buying and Rs 62,000 for selling of 100 pieces.

Cabinet Clears Bill on Mines Auction to Replace Coal Ordinance: ReportChina December Industrial Activity Shrinks for First Time in 7 Months
New Delhi: The government on Tuesday cleared a Bill on coal block auctions to replace an Ordinance that was promulgated to begin auction of coal mines that were cancelled by the Supreme Court.
The Bill to replace the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Ordinance, 2014 is likely to be brought before the Parliament during the ongoing winter session.
"Cabinet has approved the bill," a source said after the Cabinet meeting here.
The Supreme Court had in September cancelled allocation of 204 coal blocks, including 42 operational mines and another 32 ready-to-start blocks.
Government through the Ordinance started the process of auctioning at least 74 operational or ready-to-operate blocks with the target of allocating them by March, well before the deadline set by Supreme Court for companies operating the mines to wind up operations.
The Ordinance has been opposed by the central trade unions including Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS). BMS as also AITUC, CITU, HMS and INTUC have jointly opposed the government's proposal to allow private players to mine coal and sell it in the open market, a right till now reserved with the state-owned Coal India Limited.
Meanwhile government has already said that the 74 coal mines, which government plans to auction to specific end-users in the first phase of bidding on February 11, will not require any green clearances.
The auction will be for the private sector, while state-owned companies will get mines via allotment.
The government had last week announced auctioning and allotment of 74 blocks in the first phase of bidding. These blocks have a potential to produce 210 million tonnes of coal.
Government had already made it clear that the number of mines a company can bid will be capped to avoid monopoly.

RBI expects inflation to fall further  holds ratesRBI holds rates, expects inflation to fall further
BT Online Bureau     New Delhi   Last Updated: December 3, 2014  | 08:32 IST

The RBI kept the key policy rates unchanged in its monetary policy review on Tuesday.
Unveiling the monetary policy review, the RBI kept the repo rate (8 per cent) , reverse repo rate (7 per cent) and the CRR (4.0 per cent) unchanged.
It expects November inflation to soften further. In the statement,  the bank said risks to Jan 2016 target of 6% inflation is evenly balanced. The bank sees GDP growth seen at 5.5% in 2015-16. The March-end CPI inflation has been revised down to 6% from 8% earlier.
The RBI expects inflation at 6% over the next 12 months.
RBI says success of ongoing govt actions in removing infrastructural constraints will be key to reviving growth.
Addressing a press conference, RBI governor Raghuram Rajan said the government is comfortable with setting 4 per cent inflation target plus/minus 2 per cent beyond 2016.
There is a misconception among corporates that central bank is not concerned about growth, said the RBI governor.
On the interest rates, Rajan said even though rates have come down, banks have not passed it on
The policy states domestic activity weakened in Q2 of 2014-15, and activity is likely to be muted in Q3 also because of a moderate kharif harvest. The deficiency in the north-east monsoon rainfall has constrained the pace of rabi sowing, except in the southern States.
The persisting contraction in the production of both capital goods and consumer goods in Q2 reflected weak aggregate domestic demand. However, more recent readings of core sector activity, automobile sales and purchasing managers' indices suggest improvement in likely activity.
Exports have buffered the slowdown in industrial activity in Q2 but, going forward, require support from partner country growth, the policy said.  
The sixth bi-monthly monetary policy statement is scheduled on Tuesday, February 3, 2015.

SpiceJet  seems to have flown itself into turbulence. Sources say daily flight cancellations at the airline have risen to as high as 70 a day from the 40-odd in mid-November.  According to sources, SpiceJet is now left with a fleet of only 20 Boeing aircraft and of these only 18 are operational. That's almost half of its fleet strength of 39 aircraft in August this year.
At its peak, the airline was operating 345 daily flights this summer but now that number is down to 275.
Sources say as the number of planes it operates reduces, SpiceJet will most likely shut down operations to Indore, Varanasi, Aurangabad, Surat, Mysore, Trivandrum, Sharjah, Kathmandu and Kabul.
Meanwhile, Network 18 also learns that employees earning below Rs 50,000 a month, that is, largely front line staff, have been paid salary this evening but no time line has been given for salary payment to the rest of the staff. The airline delayed payment of salaries for the first time this weekend with COO Sanjiv Kapoor promising employees that they would be paid soon.
An airline spokesperson did not respond to queries on salary delays or whether operations to any destinations would be suspended.
SpiceJet stock price
On December 10, 2014, SpiceJet closed at Rs 13.90, up Rs 0.35, or 2.58 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 22.20 and the 52-week low was Rs 11.10.
The latest book value of the company is Rs -16.49 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company was -0.84.

Are You Full of Mojo or NojoZombie-like -- living dead
How's Your Mojo?
How can we recognize Mojo or Nojo in ourselves and in others? Start by evaluating yourself and the people you meet on their Mojo or Nojo qualities, using the table above. What is your attitude toward what you do? Is it positive or negative? What do you radiate to others? Think about this a bit.
When I think about the truly successful human beings that I have met in my journey through life -- the people who are succeeding at both what they do and how they feel about themselves -- I realize they all have MOJO. We see people with MOJO in every occupation and at every level of an organization. I was recently working at a health-care organization. I watched as their CEO gave awards to employees who best demonstrated their organization's values. I was amazed at the great attitude -- the Mojo -- shown by award-winners in such diverse occupations as cafeteria workers, technicians, nurses, and administrators. These people were all demonstrating Mojo.
While I enjoyed observing these exuberant and motivated people get their awards, I thought about the thousands of people in similar jobs around the world who don't demonstrate Mojo, the people who had a negative spirit toward what they were doing. That, too, starts from the inside and is apparent on the outside.
When There's No Mojo
When you get the chance, observe two different employees doing exactly the same job at the same time. One could be the embodiment of Mojo while the other is the poster child for Nojo. Case in point: flight attendants. For 32 years, my work has taken me around the world. On American Airlines alone, I just passed the dubious milestone of more than 10 million frequent flyer miles! All this flying has given me the chance to interact with thousands of flight attendants.
Most are dedicated, professional, and service-oriented. They demonstrate mojo. A few are grumpy and act like they would rather be anywhere else than on the plane. They demonstrate Nojo. I've seen two groups of attendants doing exactly the same activity, at the same time, for the same company, probably at around the same salary, yet the messages that each is sending to the world about their experience is completely different.
Mojo Living!
By increasing our understanding of our identity, we can increase our Mojo. We can learn how to get Mojo, how to keep it, and how we get it back if we lose it. We can let go of what does not create happiness and meaning in our lives, and strive for what really matters to us -- we can live a life full of Mojo, meaning, and purpose!

Hughes family wants big crowd at funeral
Australia's captain Michael Clarke will deliver a tribute to Hughes at the funeral and will be a pall-bearer, along with Aaron Finch and Tom Cooper.

Phillip Hughes ' family hopes as many people as possible will attend his funeral in Macksville on Wednesday. Approximately 5000 mourners are expected to attend the funeral service, which will take place at 2pm in the sports hall at Macksville High School, with overflow areas on the school's two sports ovals.
Cricket Australia also expect 300 to 400 dignitaries and past and present players to attend the service, including the entire New South Wales and Australia Test squads. James Henderson, Hughes' manager, told reporters in Macksville on Tuesday that despite the limited capacity of the school hall, the family hoped anyone who wanted to attend would do so.
"For the people who aren't able to get into the hall, the family has made arrangements for several overflow areas at the local high school," Henderson said. "So everybody should come to celebrate Phillip's life. That's what the family wants."
After the service, players will form a guard of honour and a public procession will then follow the hearse through Macksville.
"People who are at the high school during the service are asked to line the streets and pay the most fitting farewell to Macksville's favourite," Henderson said. "Also tomorrow evening, the whole town will stop to celebrate Phillip's life. The family wants to see as many people as it possibly can."
Hughes died at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney on Thursday after being struck by a bouncer during the New South Wales-South Australia Sheffield Shield match at the SCG on Tuesday last week. Henderson said the Hughes family had been touched by the support shown by the public since the tragic event.
"The past week has certainly been a very, very difficult time for the family and for the broader community," he said. "And they've been very moved from the support that's come from here in Australia and obviously all the way around the world, where Phil's untimely and sad passing has affected so many people.
"They're very proud that their son has made such an impression on people who knew him and obviously people now who have come to know him in this unfortunate circumstance ... Hughesy was a real no-fuss guy, and I know he would be looking down on this and wondering what the hell is going on."
The funeral will be broadcast live on television in Australia and public viewings of the service will also take place at the SCG, Adelaide Oval, WACA and Bellerive Oval. Australia's captain Michael Clarke will deliver a tribute to Hughes at the funeral and will be a pall-bearer, along with Aaron Finch and Tom Cooper .

Foodie  racing enthusiast and movie buff who detested cheapcomedyWritten by Garima Rakesh Mishra | Pune |

Veteran Hindi film and television actor Deven Verma passed away at the Sahyadri Hospital here in the early hours of Tuesday following a cardiac arrest and kidney failure. He was 77. Family members said Verma had been unwell for the last one-and-a-half years.
“Tell him I will always love him, he will be the only one for me,” cried the actor’s wife Rupa Ganguly, daughter of legendary actor the late Ashok Kumar, as relatives carried his body into an ambulance to be taken to the crematorium in Yerawada for funeral. Verma was cremated around noon.
Brother-in-law Arup Kumar said Verma had diabetes for the last 35 years. “He had been told a long time ago about the blockages in his heart and had been recommended a bypass surgery, which he refused. On Monday evening, he started getting restless and was rushed to hospital,” said his niece Jyotika Karve. He died at 2 am.
Manish Kumar, General Manager (Operations) at the Sahyadri Hospital, said the actor was brought in with complaints of dizziness and reduced urine output. He had low blood pressure and was admitted to the ICU at 8 pm. He died of “malignant ventricular arrhythmias”.
Though his last rites were performed in the absence of any big names from Bollywood, apart from actor and relative Anuradha Patel, family members said friends from the industry had been calling since morning. A memorial service is expected by the end of this week at the lawns of Kalyani Nagar’s Pushpak Society where he lived.
Born on October 23, 1937, in Mumbai, Verma’s family moved to Pune while he was in his pre-teens. He studied in a school in Panchgani and later graduated in politics and sociology from Nowrosjee Wadia College before moving to Mumbai to study law. He dropped out after getting roles in movies. “During a felicitation function in 2012, Verma said Wadia college gave him his first lessons in drama when he started participating in college drama festivals,” said V P Bonde, former principal of the college.
Verma worked in nearly 150 films and is best known for his award-winning comic performances in Chori Mera Kaam, Golmaal, Angoor and Chor Ke Ghar Chor among others. His last Hindi film was Calcutta Mail (2003). He had acted in many regional movies too and turned producer with Yakeen in 1969. He  also directed a film in the 1970s.
Family members said Verma spoke many languages. A foodie, the actor loved horses too and never missed any race at the Turf Club. The film buff had a special room on the first floor of his posh Kalyani Nagar bungalow only for watching movies. “A man of principles, he detested cheap comedy”, said a family member.

2010-12: Over 4000 died on shop floor but thats fraction oftotalWritten by Anil Sasi | New Delhi |

At around 2.30 pm on October 21, three days before this Diwali, a blast at the Manikanta Fireworks manufacturing unit in the coastal village of Vakathippa near Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh left behind a trail of destruction and 17 bodies. The intensity of the blast at the tiled manufacturing unit was such that the bodies of the victims — 14 of them young women who earned Rs 150 per day — were found strewn nearly 30 metres away in an adjoining rice field.
Four years ago, S Ambiga, a line operator at the Nokia factory in Tamil Nadu’s Sriperumbudur – one of the most modern assembling units in the country – succumbed to her injuries in a hospital after being hit by the arm of an automatic loader machine while reportedly trying to retrieve an electronic chip board on the evening of October 31.
In the first case, chances are that the 17 who lost their lives will not even figure in the official statistics on industrial fatalities as the firecracker manufacturing is bracketed in the informal sector and the Kakinada unit was operating on an expired licence.
In the second, Ambiga was one of the 75 fatalities in 2010 from Tamil Nadu, a state that is among half a dozen others that have seen high accidental fatalities in industrial units, according to data from 2010 to 2012 collected by the Labour Ministry’s Directorate General, Factory Advice Service and Labour Institutes (DGFASLI) from the Chief Inspector of factories of states and union territories.
At Sriperumbudur, the accident happened at about 6.50 pm and Ambiga remained trapped till 7.15 pm, according to testimonies that the factory workers furnished to an inquiry committee. While the Nokia management said that the company investigated the circumstances that led to the accident “as per factory norms and guidelines”, neither the company’s report nor the official inquiry report, prepared by the then Labour Commissioner Hans Raj Varma and submitted to the state government, have been made public. The Nokia India spokesperson did not respond to an email sent on Monday by The Indian Express with a query on the accident.
In statistical terms, a clear trend is that apart from Tamil Nadu, states such as Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Kerala, Punjab and Maharashtra are among those that have either witnessed a steady increase in industrial fatalities or seen high numbers during the last three years for which official data is available.
In absolute terms, the fatalities are the highest in industrialised states such as Gujarat and Maharashtra, as also in resource-rich states such as Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, where mining is a major industrial activity. But the official statistics are updated only till 2012.
But clearly, there are more deaths occurring in the interiors of India’s industrial landscape that do not get documented. Official statistics suggest there were 4,275 documented fatalities in Indian factories between 2010 and 2012. Analysts say that even by the most conservative estimate, the actual numbers could be at least ten times higher if continued…

Many shoppers apparently headed for car dealers rather than the malls over the Thanksgiving weekend, driving a big finish for already strong auto industry sales in November.
Total industry sales for the month were up 4.6%, to slightly more than 1.3 million, the best since 2001. The annualized selling rate was 17.2 million, according to Autodata.
Many makers promoted extra "Black Friday" deals to take advantage of the month's holiday weekend, and loans rates remain low.
"Clever advertising from a handful of automakers planted the seed in shoppers' minds that rather than standing in Black Friday lines at retail stores to save tens of dollars, they could instead pocket hundreds and even thousands by taking advantage of deals on cars," said Jeremy Acevedo, analyst for car-shopping website Edmunds.com.
"This message seems to have resonated, particularly for GM's Buick and GMC brands that offered 20% off sticker prices for all models," Acevedo said. GM's 6.5% sales increase for the month strongly beat expectations.
Chrysler Group kicked off today's cavalcade of November auto sales reports with  a healthy 20% jump vs. the month a year ago courtesy of its star brand, Jeep.
Ford, meanwhile, reported a 1.8% decline — which it said was expected as it works to increase availability of its redesigned 2015 F-150 pickup, the redone Mustang and the new Transit commercial van.
Among the biggest foreign makers, Toyota's overall sales were up 3% from a year ago, Honda gained 4.6% and Nissan was off 3.1%, though that still was better than expected.
Company-by-company details for the industry:
GENERAL MOTORS
General Motors, lately an also-ran in the sales-increase arena, posted a healthy 6.5% increase over a year ago, selling 225,818 new cars and trucks in November, best for that month since pre-recession 2007.
"Significantly better than expected," commented Ryan Brinkman, JPMorgan auto industry investment analyst. And it was accompanied by rising transaction prices, he pointed out, suggesting higher profits.
It wasn't without a big issue, though.
Luxury brand Cadillac was a sad story — down 18.7% as the collapse of its car sales and its midsize crossover SUV were too much for the big Escalade SUV's  booming sales to outweigh.
XTS, a big sedan that was supposed to edge the brand closer to its German rivals, withered 50.3%. ATS, the small entry sedan intended to match the BMW 3 Series, was off 33.7%. And CTS, recently redesigned, was down 7.5%.
Even Cadillac's stalwart SRX midsize crossover SUV, despite buyers' renewed SUV fervor, continued its vanishing act — down 30.9%.
GM's Buick premium brand and its GMC truck brand posted the biggest increases, 27% and 22.7%, respectively, as GM was able to sell to both ends of the buying spectrum.
Buick's heroes:
Encore, a subcompact SUV, among the pioneers of upmarket small SUVs, now is reaping the fruits of its daring as urbanites rush to trim, well-furnished SUVs. Encore's sales were up 71.9%.
Lacrosse sedan jumped 70.6%. It was heavily promoted on TV with ads suggesting that Buick is a hip brand, not a fogey's ride, and with 20% discounts later in the month.
GMC benefited from buyers' return to trucks as fuel prices slide and mileage becomes less important, and by GMC's affiliation with the NFL, advertising heavily on football games.
Sierra full-size pickup sales zoomed 57% ahead of November a year ago. The redesigned Yukon full-size, traditional, truck-based SUV was up 14.5%, while the smaller Terrain SUV rose 13.4%.
At GM's cornerstone brand, Chevrolet, the Spark minicar had the biggest jump, 64.3%, but that still was just a total 2,861 vehicles.
Cruze compact sedan was a lively seller, up 25.6%, in a very competitive segment where it's had trouble sustaining momentum. Chevy's midsize Malibu, on the other hand, tumbled 16.7% despite recent updates.
Silverado full-size pickup improved 24.5%, and the big, Silverado-based Tahoe SUV rose 10.4%.
Chevrolet's midsize Colorado pickup made its debut, snagging about the same number of buyers as the Corvette sports car. GM expects that to ramp up fast, based on big numbers of dealer orders before the truck hit the market.
GM's full-size Sierra and Silverado combined outsold the Ford F-Series, selling a combined 65,343 to Ford's 59,049 as the new-design, aluminum-body F-150 still is cranking up production.
GM shares closed up 1% to $33.26 on Tuesday.
FORD MOTOR
U.S. sales were 187,000 vehicles, and the decline came despite 22% growth for the Escape compact crossover to 25,528 and a 13% gain for the Explorer to 14,949.
Ford cars were down 5% overall, with only the Police Interceptor and the all-new Mustang posting gains. Ford sold 8,728 of the new Mustangs.
The redesigned version of the big F-150 pickup, the best-selling U.S. vehicle, was just arriving at dealers in November, and its sales, mostly close-out 2014s, were down 9.9%.
The Lincoln brand posted an overall 21% jump to 8,113, led by the refreshed Navigator's 88% growth to 1,433.
Ford shares bounced up 0.8% to close at $15.90.
CHRYSLER GROUP
The unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles said it sold 170,839 new cars and trucks this November,  making it the best November since 2001. Jeep was up 27%, setting a record for the month.
The Jeep Cherokee, long-delayed replacement for the Liberty, had been on sale only a short time a year ago. This year's monthly total was 66.6% better than the previous November.
The small Jeep Patriot, long in the tooth but still popular and benefiting from buyers' return to SUVs — especially small ones — was up 47%.
The new-design Chrysler 200 sedan  zoomed 155%, pulling up the Chrysler brand overall by 29.6%.
Laggards were the Fiat and Dodge brands, each up just 1% despite new models.
Fiat-owned Alfa Romeo returned to the U.S. with the 4C sports car, finding 24 buyers.
Fiat Chrysler stock, traded as FCAU, closed up 3% at $13.09. FCAU went public mid-October at $9.
TOYOTA MOTOR
The big Japan-based automaker, No. 3 on the U.S. sales charts, took a hit in cars but was rescued by trucks and wound up reporting 183,346 sales in November, up 3% from a year earlier.
Toyota-brand cars were off 2.7%. Lexus luxury brand car sales were down 0.7%. Toyota's youth-oriented Scion sub-brand, which sells only cars, crashed 21.7%.
Toyota's only car to sell well in the month was the Corolla compact sedan, up 13.2%. The Camry midsize sedan, despite an update for 2015, was off 5.1%.
But Toyota's SUVs, which the industry counts as trucks, were boosted by the recently redone but still old-school 4Runner midsize SUV, which was up 53.4%, and the makeover of the Highlander crossover SUV, up 16.7%.
The smaller RAV4 crossover SUV was up 8.5%.
Lexus SUVs overall were up 3.2%.
"Auto industry sales during Thanksgiving weekend were even better than expected," said Bill Fay, Toyota division group vice president and general manager. "Consumer demand for light trucks continues unabated, and Toyota dealers set November sales records for light trucks and SUVs."
AMERICAN HONDA
The company said it sold 121,814 Honda and Acura vehicles in the month, up 4.6%, as a number of models set records.
Honda's CR-V compact crossover SUV, already the best-selling SUV of any kind in the U.S., jumped 37.7% to set a November record.
The redesigned Fit subcompact hatchback also broke its November sales record, zooming 55.1%. That helped offset significant declines by the company's two core sedans, Accord midsize and Civic compact.
Acura's TLX sedan, new to the lineup, was by far the brand's best-selling car, and it helped boost the premium marque's car sales 29.5%. Acura's SUV sales, though, ran counter to the industry and fell 11.4%.
NISSAN MOTOR
The company reported a sales decline of 3.1% in November to 103,188, as both its Nissan and Infiniti brands fell.
The company also said that with a month remaining its year-to-date U.S. sales are  1,269,577, up 11.5% from a year ago, already a full-year record.
Nissan brand sales were down 1.7% from a year ago, with car sales down 6.6%, offsetting a 6.5% gain for its trucks and crossovers.
Leading truck growth was a 43.7% gain for the redone Rogue compact crossover.
Sales for the Sentra compact sedan were up 6%, but sales for the brand's volume leader, the Altima midsize sedan, were off 7.2% to 22,832.
Overall sales for the Infiniti premium brand fell 13.3% from a year ago to  11,398.
SUBARU
Subie posted a record November in the U.S., up 24% from a year ago to 45,273, and already has broken its annual sales record with a month to go with year-to-date sales up 21% to 463,770.
The redone Outback posted a record month (up 59.6% to 14,128), as did the Forest SUV that continues to be hot (up 3.5% to 13,879), and the WRX performance model (up 79.6% to 2,707).
Meanwhile, the redone Legacy midsize sedan, posted a 97% sales increase to 5,733, continuing its comeback in that large market segment.
"Since achieving our 2013 record earlier this month, every sale is a new record," said Thomas J. Doll, president and chief operating officer, Subaru of America. "2014 will be a historic year for the Subaru franchise as we will break 500,000 sales before year end."
VOLKSWAGEN
Propelled by sales of the refreshed Jetta compact sedan and redesigned Golf line, VW continued its sales turnaround after months of declines to post a 3.2% sales gain in November to 31,725.
The bump came on sales of cars and despite the brand's limited offerings of crossover SUVs, which drove the sales at most makers in the month.
The Jetta's sales jumped 31.8% to 14,268, while the new Golf was up 85.9% to 2,149 and the Golf GTI performance model was up 64.8% to 1,725. The flagship Passat midsize sedan, however, plunged 21.5% to 6,966 in November and is off 12% this year for the 11 months through November.
Sales of the brand's aging SUVs continue to be even, even as SUV sales overall are booming, with the Tiguan compact down 16.5% year-to-date and the Touareg midsize down 14.3%.
Diesel-powered vehicles accounted for 17.2% of VW sales.
AUDI
With a month to go in the year, the Volkswagen-owned premium brand has already passed last year's U.S. record sales and ensuring a fifth consecutive record year. Sales in November shot up 22% vs. the month a year ago to 16,640 vehicles and year-to-date sales are up 15.4% to 162,773.
Sales of SUVs were strong, with the three-row Q7 up 14.6% to 1,746 units and the smaller Q5 up 16.8% to 4,184 units sold for the month.
The new A3 line, now with gas and diesel sedans, a convertible and a performance model, continued a steady rollout with sales of 2,511.
Diesel models generated 12.2% of sales, with the big Q7 at 19.1%.
HYUNDAI
The South Korean automaker reported sales declined 4% in November to 53,672, though it noted that the slip was against a record November a year ago. The redone Sonata midsize sedan, the brand's volume leader, has sales up 12% to 18,515. And the Genesis premium sedan had sales up 57% from a year ago to 2,431.
KIA
The Hyundai corporate sibling reported sales of sales of 44,936 units, down 1%, but enough to already give the brand a third consecutive year of 500,000-plus sales and put it on pace for another U.S. record.
Volume leaders were the Optima midsize sedan at 12,707, up 16,8% and the Soul boxy car at 9,146, down 28.9%. The brand's biggest percentage gainer was its all-new Sedona minivan with sales up 578% to 3,538.
MERCEDES-BENZ
The German automaker generally followed the industry — car sales tumbled, but the maker was rescued by strong SUV sales.
Car sales fell 7.1%, while SUVs zipped 18.6%, for an overall increase of 2% in November.
Car stars were the new C-Class, up 24.5%, and the big S-Class sedan up 34.8%.
SUV standouts were the M-Class SUV, up 19.9%, and the GLA small SUV, which wasn't on sale last year, added 1,812 sales to account for 12% of all M-B SUV sales.
MAZDA
The Japanese maker reported monthly sales up 2.4% vs. a year ago to 21,242 vehicles.
Growth leaders were the CX-5 small crossover, up 14.2% to 7,220, and the Mazda6 midsize sedan, up 6.9% to 3,891.
The volume-selling Mazda3 compact was flat at 7,761.
BMW GROUP
Sales for the BMW and Mini brands overall declined about 1% in November to 36,028, driven by a 2.3% slip in sales of BMW-brand vehicles to 31,019, while Mini posted a gain of 9.5% to 5,009.
"The traffic in our showrooms was very strong in November, especially over the Thanksgiving weekend, and I expect that momentum to continue in December and carry us to an all-time sales record at the end of 2014," said Ludwig Willisch, president and CEO, BMW of North America. "I am especially pleased to see Mini moving forward as availability of the new models improves. "
PORSCHE
The performance brand's sales rose 18.5% to 4,699, led by a 68.6% jump in sales of its SUVs to 2,606.
The company noted that November was the first full month of sales for the redone 2015 Cayenne SUV and sales were 1,619 Cayenne vehicle deliveries. The all-new Macan small SUV had sales of 897.

Investing.com - Investing.com - The yen and Aussie were steady in early Asia on Wednesday with GDP data due out of Sydney and China services from Beijing expected to set the tone.
AUD/USD traded at 0.8448, down 0.03%, while USD/JPY changed hands at 119.24, down 0.01%. EUR/USD traded flat at 1.2383.
China's less-closely watched services PMI for November from the CFLP is due at 0900 local/0100 GMT. In October, it dipped to 53.8 from 54.0 in October, while HSBC's (0945/0145 GMT) slipped to 52.9 from 53.5. Both indexes have been largely range bound for months.
Elsewhere, Australia's November AIGroup services index rose 0.2 point to 43.8, rebounding slightly from October when the index fell for the eighth month in a row to the lowest reading since August 2013.
At 1130 (0030 GMT) is the release of Australia's third quarter GDP data, with a gain of 0.7% expected quarter-on-quarter.
Overnight, the dollar firmed against most major currencies on Tuesday after a U.S. construction barometer beat expectations and fueled hopes for sustained recovery, while uncertainty ahead of the European Central Bank's Thursday announcement on monetary policy fueled safe haven demand for the greenback as well.
The Census Bureau reported earlier that U.S. construction spending rose 1.1% in October from a month earlier, beating market estimates for a 0.6% gain after a 0.1% contraction in September.
It was the largest gain since May, and the report boosted the dollar by cementing expectations for the Federal Reserve to hike benchmark borrowing costs in 2015.
Investors were keeping an eye towards Friday, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its November jobs report.
Meanwhile across the Atlantic, the European Central Bank will announce its latest decision on monetary policy this Thursday, and investors avoided the euro ahead of time on uncertainty as to whether monetary authorities will announce fresh stimulus measures.
Data released last Friday revealed that the annual rate of euro area inflation slowed to a five-year low of 0.3% last month from 0.4% in October.
Sentiment on the single currency also remained vulnerable after data on Monday showed that the euro zone's manufacturing purchasing managers' index slowed to 50.1 from a preliminary reading of 50.4 last month, just barely above the 50 level separating growth from contraction.
The ECB's current stimulus program includes purchases of asset-backed securities and covered bonds, though markets are keeping a close eye out for plans to announce purchases of government debt, a stimulus tool known as quantitative easing that weakens paper currencies by suppressing interest rates.
Elsewhere on Tuesday, Spain reported that the number of unemployed people declined by 14,700 in November, compared to expectations for an increase of 57,300, after a 79,200 rise in October.
In the U.K., construction activity expanded at the slowest rate in more than a year in November, dampening optimism over the country's economic outlook, according to industry data.
Market research firm Markit Economics and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply reported that their U.K. construction purchasing managers' index declined to a seasonally adjusted 59.4 in November from 61.4 in October. Economists had expected the index to fall to 61.2 in November.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates expansion, below indicates contraction.
The US dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.01% at 88.70.

Investing.com - Investing.com - Crude futures dropped on Tuesday after an upbeat construction gauge boosted the U.S. dollar, while ongoing concerns that supply will remain ample while demand soft pushed prices lower as well.
A stronger greenback tends to make oil a less attractive commodity on dollar-denominated exchanges, especially in the eyes of investors holding other currencies.
In the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures for delivery in January traded down 2.35% at $67.38 a barrel during U.S. trading, up from a session low of $66.74 a barrel and off a high of $69.40 a barrel.
The January contract settled up 4.31% at $69.00 a barrel on Monday.
Support for the commodity was seen at $63.72 a barrel, Monday's low, and resistance at $73.56 a barrel, Friday's high.
The Census Bureau reported earlier that U.S. construction spending rose 1.1% in October from a month earlier, beating market estimates for a 0.6% gain after a 0.1% contraction in September.
It was the largest gain since May, and the report boosted the dollar by cementing expectations for the Federal Reserve to hike benchmark borrowing costs in 2015, which sent oil prices dropping in a selloff exacerbated by supply concerns.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said last week that it would keep its official production target unchanged at 30 million barrels a day, disappointing hopes the oil cartel would lower output to support the market.
The 12-member group is responsible for approximately 40% of global supply.
Concerns over weakening global demand combined with indications that OPEC producers will not cut output have weighed on prices in recent months as have the realizations that conflicts in the Mideast and in Eastern Europe have not disrupted supply as once feared.
Markets have assumed that Saudi Arabia championed letting prices fall in hopes less cost-effective U.S. shale producers would halt operations.
Still, concerns that less shale out flowing out of the U.S. will take a while to chip away at a global supply glut dampened prices on Tuesday.
Separately, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil futures for January delivery were down 2.17% at US$70.97 a barrel, while the spread between Brent and U.S. crude contracts stood at $3.59.

Changing trend: At IITs  startups & e-commerce firms play pied piper for graduatesCodeNation
("Students rate these companies…)
MUMBAI: At least one in every 9 students graduating from the 2015 batch across IITs is likely to join an ecomm firm/startup.
Data collated on Tuesday (day 2 of placement season) from prominent recruiters as well as campus placement cells at many IITs suggests that ecommerce firms/startups will roll out a minimum of 1,000-1,200 offers during the next 3-4 months of placements.
About 9,000 students will graduate out of 16 IITs this year.
Four big players — Flipkart (200-220), Ola-Cabs (200), Snapdeal (100-plus) and Housing.com (100-150) — alone will make around 670 offers at IIT campuses. These four companies hired only 213 grads last year — a 215% increase this year.Acombination of the hectic startup activity — an estimated 800 ventures launched every year — and billions of dollars pumped into consumer Internet ventures from big names like Tiger Global and SoftBank have contributed to this huge surge in hiring.
"Our growth plans are so aggressive that we need top talent to drive growth. Our hiring plans are a function of the pace at which we are growing," said Saurabh Nigam, VP-HR, Snapdeal.
Snapdeal has quadrupled its hiring targets from the IITs this year.
Ola is visiting the IITs at Delhi , Kanpur, Madras and Bombay and plans a 10-fold hiring increase from year last. "We are expanding aggressively into newer cities and going deeper in cities we are already present.
Continuous influx of great talent can help us grow faster and smarter," Anand Subramanian, director - marketing communication, said.
Several other startups, including CodeNation , TaxiForSure , Indus Insights, LimeRoad, Knowlarity Communications, Fuzzy Logix, Vizury and BrowserStack among others, are planning to hire anywhere between 10 and 50 students each across IITs. "Students are excited by these companies, for their work culture, the independence and even the compensation structure," says Parth Vaswani, overall placement coordinator, IITKanpur.
"For many, they probably rank right behind the software sector in terms of the pecking order," he says.
Several of these companies also recruit for IT-software roles.
Vaswani expects at least 150 such offers this year compared to 60-odd last year.
At IIT-Bombay, around 60-70 companies -- almost 20% of the total that have signed up so far --fall in the ecommerce/startup bracket.
Students rate these companies highly, which is why several of them get slotted in the first few days of campus placement, Mohak Mehta, BTech student representative for IIT-Bombay said.
Across IITs, these ecommerce/startup companies are hiring across a variety of roles for salaries that range between Rs 10-18 lakh, going up to a maximum of Rs 24 lakh from the likes of Code-Nation.

Energy leads Wall Street higher; Dow sets recordChevron
(Energy shares on the S&P…)
NEW YORK: US stocks rose on Tuesday as energy stocks led the S&P 500 and Dow, while Biogen's rally on news about an experimental treatment for Alzheimer's disease topped gains at the Nasdaq.
The day's gains were broad, with nine of the 10 S&P 500 industry sectors higher. The only group to fall was telecoms , down 1.8 per cent with AT&T down 2.2 per cent at $34.29 and Verizon down 1.8 per cent at $49.11. Sprint announced it will cut in half the monthly price of service for Verizon and AT&T customers who switch to Sprint.
Energy shares on the S&P 500 rose 1.3 per cent even as crude oil prices resumed their fall. US crude fell 2.4 per cent to near a five-year low while Brent lost 2.3 per cent.
Exxon Mobil and Chevron were among the largest gainers on both the Dow and the S&P, up about 2 per cent each.
"The market is sniffing out a bottom in the underlying commodity and we are seeing a bounce in energy stocks from having been oversold in the last month or so," said John Manley, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in New York.
"It's in no one's interest for oil to go any lower; not in ours, or OPEC's," he said, adding that it is still a big benefit for consumers but the marginal gain with even lower gas would not be much bigger.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 102.75 points, or 0.58 per cent, to 17,879.55, a record high. The S&P 500 gained 13.11 points, or 0.64 per cent, to 2,066.55 and the Nasdaq Composite added 28.46 points, or 0.6 per cent, to 4,755.81.
Carmaker shares advanced as the top six automakers sold more cars and trucks in November than analysts expected. GM gained 1 per cent to $33.26 and Fiat Chrysler gained 3 per cent to $13.09.
Biogen Idec advanced 6.4 per cent to $328.27. The company is planning a late-stage trial of its experimental treatment for Alzheimer's disease after the drug significantly improved cognition in a small early-stage study.
Avanir Pharmaceuticals was among the most traded stocks on the Nasdaq, rising 12.8 per cent to $16.92. Japanese drugmaker Otsuka Holdings plans to buy it for about $3.5 billion.
About two issues advanced for every decliner on both the NYSE and Nasdaq.
The S&P 500 posted 89 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite set 102 new highs and 95 new lows.
About 6.6 billion shares changed hands on US exchanges, according to BATS Global Markets data, above the daily average last month of about 6.17 billion.

REPRESENTATIVE IMAGE: Dhruva Space sealed a deal with Amsat India, and the grouping will develop radio payloads for the satellite being built by the Bengaluru company.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
BENGALURU: A two-year-old startup is aiming to be the first Indian company to design and manufacture satellites as it gears up for a commercial launch within the next two years. Dhruva Space, co-founded by space technologist Sanjay Nekkanti, is developing two satellites that weigh less than 30 kg each — the first one will be a technology demonstrator and the second, a private satellite for the Indian arm of Amateur Radio Operators , a global non-profit body that promotes launch of radio satellites.
On Sunday, Dhruva Space sealed a deal with Amsat India , and the grouping will develop radio payloads for the satellite being built by the Bengaluru company.
"India is the face of future frugal innovation," said Nekkanti, 25, a holder of two masters degrees in space technology and spacecraft instrumentation from Lulea University of Technology in Sweden. "Isro has proved that. It is now our turn to prove that for the private space industry," he said, adding that the inspiration came from Isro's Mars mission.
Dhruva's satellites are expected to be launched on Isro's workhorse Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle . Nekkanti said his team is working closely with the space organisation for design approvals and testing of the satellites. If the process is successful, it will lead to the launch of Dhruva's first satellite in early 2016, with the second following soon after.
"We are building satellites in the 10-100 kg range, which can do the same thing as an 800-kg satellite. This is pure commercial grade," said Abhishek Raju, 30, the chief strategy officer of Dhruva.
"They have made a presentation to us some time back and have been asked to give a formal proposal to Isro," said Mylswamy Annadurai, project director at Isro Satellite Center, Bangalore While there are about 400 private companies that supply components to Isro, Dhruva Space will be the first to develop an entire satellite, according to the company's co-founders.
Dhruva was set up in 2012 by Nekkanti, the CEO, Narayan Prasad, his collegemate, and Raju. The three have firmed up collaborations with several industry organisations, including satellite company Berlin Space Technologies , Saber Astronautics in Australia and launch facilitation firm Earth2Orbit India . They have also roped in several former scientists at Isro as advisors.
Experts are of the view that small satellites are the key to the growth of the private space industry. SpaceWorks Enterprises, a space consultancy in Atlanta, estimates that about 2,750 nano or microsatellites will be launched in the next six years with a 15% increase in the commercial launch market.
"What was space-grade around 30 years ago is now commercial grade, and that's what Dhruva is following.
There, however, needs to be a solid infrastructure for private satellite launches," said KR Sridhara Murthi, a former MD of Isro's commercial arm, Antrix Corporation , and advisor to Dhruva Space.
The company says it uses 3D printing technology, advanced CNC machines and opensource architectures for the final integration of the spacecraft.
Raju said the average budget for a satellite developed by Isro —known for its frugal Mars mission that cost less than a Hollywood blockbuster —is about Rs 200-300 crore. "Unconventional techniques and higher risk do not mean quality compromises," said Raju.
Automatic Identification of Ships, disaster management, pollution monitoring and national security are the priority applications for the company.
Small satellites that weigh less than 100 kg are at present used as experimental functional substitutes for large satellites.
In India, students have built and launched small satellites, including Jugnu, which weighed 3 kg and was built at the IIT-Kanpur. Nekkanti was also part of a team at the SRM University in Chennai which built a 10-kg satellite with guidance from Isro in 2011.

Dow Jones Hits Record High as Energy Stocks Gain
Reuters | Updated On: December 03, 2014 08:13 (IST)
Oil Slumps Near $59 for First Time Since 2009 on Oversupply
New York: US stocks rose on Tuesday as energy stocks led the S&P 500 and Dow, while Biogen's rally on news about an experimental treatment for Alzheimer's disease topped gains at the Nasdaq.
The day's gains were broad, with nine of the 10 S&P 500 industry sectors higher. The only group to fall was telecoms, down 1.8 per cent with AT&T down 2.2 per cent at $34.29 and Verizon down 1.8 per cent at $49.11. Sprint announced it will cut in half the monthly price of service for Verizon and AT&T customers who switch to Sprint.
Energy shares on the S&P 500 rose 1.3 per cent even as crude oil prices resumed their fall. US crude fell 2.4 per cent to near a five-year low while Brent lost 2.3 per cent.
Exxon Mobil and Chevron were among the largest gainers on both the Dow and the S&P, up about 2 per cent each.
"The market is sniffing out a bottom in the underlying commodity and we are seeing a bounce in energy stocks from having been oversold in the last month or so," said John Manley, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in New York.
"It's in no one's interest for oil to go any lower; not in ours, or OPEC's," he said, adding that it is still a big benefit for consumers but the marginal gain with even lower gas would not be much bigger.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 102.75 points, or 0.58 per cent, to 17,879.55, a record high. The S&P 500 gained 13.11 points, or 0.64 per cent, to 2,066.55 and the Nasdaq Composite added 28.46 points, or 0.6 per cent, to 4,755.81.
Carmaker shares advanced as the top six automakers sold more cars and trucks in November than analysts expected. GM gained 1 percent to $33.26 and Fiat Chrysler gained 3 per cent to $13.09.
Biogen Idec advanced 6.4 per cent to $328.27. The company is planning a late-stage trial of its experimental treatment for Alzheimer's disease after the drug significantly improved cognition in a small early-stage study.
Avanir Pharmaceuticals was among the most traded stocks on the Nasdaq, rising 12.8 per cent to $16.92. Japanese drugmaker Otsuka Holdings plans to buy it for about $3.5 billion.
About two issues advanced for every decliner on both the NYSE and Nasdaq.
The S&P 500 posted 89 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite set 102 new highs and 95 new lows.
About 6.6 billion shares changed hands on US exchanges, according to BATS Global Markets data, above the daily average last month of about 6.17 billion.

It depends on FD interest rates. If FD rates fall to 7% then 11-12% is good return.
I am an NRI and have the option of locking into 8.75% tax free NRE deposit for 5 years. I am wondering which is better, 8.75% assured for 5 years or Indian stock markets. Confused. Currently only 18% of my network of 2Crores is Indian equity Mutual funds and rest in Fixed deposits and no investment in property.

Nifty to soon hit 8500, says Sudarshan Sukhani
Sudarshan Sukhani is upbeat on Voltas, Hindustan Unilever (HUL) and SKS Microfinance.
Post your opinion here
08:00 am
Sudarshan Sukhani of s2analytics feels the market was getting overextended for the last two days. However, market is in an uptrend and it didn’t close lower so 8500 is within the reach soon, he says in an interview with CNBC-TV18’s Latha Venkatesh and Sonia Shenoy.
Continuing his bullish tone, he says that 8520-8530 levels persist to remain natural resistance levels and if the market is moving sideways, it is only getting ready for another upmove.
Going ahead, he advises investors to shy away from Bank Nifty.
On the flipside, he is confident of IT index doing well. In addition, he is upbeat on Voltas , Hindustan Unilever ( HUL ) and  SKS Microfinance .
Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview:
Q: It’s been a choppy last couple of days for us. Are you getting a sense that we could scale that 8500 level by the end of expiry today or does that look like a tough ask now?
A: It doesn’t look tough. I am getting a sense that the market had one down day day before yesterday and that was because for the last two days the market was getting overextended or little way above themselves but that has happened now. We didn’t follow-through yesterday, we didn’t close lower so the sense is that 8,500 is within reaching distance whether it happens today or not, I do not know but it could because we are in an uptrend, so that one day has not disturbed the trend much.
Q: Any resistance you see at that 8,530 mark?
A: Yes that is natural resistance that 8,520-8,530 and it possible that the resistance may hold but the important point for this market to prove that it is not going up, it has to come down. If it is moving sideways, it is only getting ready for another upmove. It hasn’t come down.
Q: What about Bank Nifty, which has been the relative outperformer for the week and probably for some time now?
A: Our stops for the short-term traders was 18,000 in the Bank Nifty – that was triggered yesterday because in the morning it fell but the Bank Nifty is best an avoid till it gets its act together. It is the Nifty where the action could come.
Q: You would buy both Crompton Greaves  and Voltas today?
A: Yes. Surprisingly both have good charts. Voltas is on the verge of making new highs and Crompton is reviving after a sharp decline. It has made a nice base and it is giving the impression of an imminent breakout – both are not only day trades but also suggesting that you could build positions in them.
Q: You want to take us through what your targets are?
A: The targets are modest for the day trader but they are much higher in Votlas for anyone who takes a position.
Q: What about a stock like HUL from the FMCG space – that would be your buy as well?
A: That would be a buy. Yesterday it had a very narrow range. Good quality stocks are normally precursors for big moves on the upside because the trend is up. Therefore, HUL is a buy given a sense that a lot of charts are looking attractive. I suggested that perhaps we are moving higher rather than lower. So it’s both day trade and position trade.
Q: You have Infosys on your list. Across the world, even US we have seen largely a technology led rally, Infosys is the only pick or will the IT index itself will do well?
A: IT index itself should do well and there is a disclosure that I am long in the IT index. Infosys independently had a very narrow range yesterday. It did nothing, just like Lever. Now these narrow range days have to be respected because its markets are getting compressed, buyers are getting ready for a breakout.
Q: One very popular stock in this Bull Run has been SKS Microfinance, you would buy that today as well?
A: Yes, SKS had a nice, decent correction. Stocks that correct and then begin to move up are ideal for buying because it was actually a buying on a dip. So here is a buy on dips example, it had a very good day yesterday. I think the correction is over and you want to take a position in it now.
Q: What about Tata Communications ?
A: This is one stock that I am just tracking on the charts. I have no idea why it is going up but it has gone up from Rs 200 to Rs 420-430 and you are probably better poised to tell us the fundamentals about it but here, at Rs 446, it is building a small trading range and willing to go higher. So we always go with momentum, there is a very strong buying possibility for making gains frankly I don’t know what it does also.
Q: Your thoughts on Reliance Capital  and on Ashok Leyland ?
A: Ashok Leyland is an opportunity and it’s a buy on dips, the small dip is now over and Reliance Capital is a complete avoid. There are many other non banking financial companies (NBFCs), so I wouldn’t touch Reliance Capital.
A far better stock to buy today is State Bank of India which is now very well above Rs 300 after that split. Therefore, SBI is a buying opportunity and a buy on dips opportunity seems to be coming in Coal India.
Q: Asian Paints  is still a buying opportunity now or would you be concerned that it has perhaps topped out?
A: It has not topped out. Yesterday it was in our buy list in the morning so I am gratified to see it go up today. It has not topped out but after a cycle two or three days, you need a pause to reenter. So, I wouldn’t buy it today.
Q: You said there are other NBFCs which are far more attractive, which would they be?
A: Among the midcap Manappuram Finance now appears to be getting its act together, so that’s something I would look at and LIC Housing Finance has been the favourite. So for a trader both these stocks in the Futures and Options (F&O) and cash segment are better.
Q: JSW Energy  has been a bit of an outperformer. The chart looks very good. Is there a trade there?
A: The chart looks excellent but the trade is for position trader; buy now, hold for few months, there is a very strong possibility of big upsurge there. I have no opinion for the day.
Q: Would you touch any of the tyre stocks?
A: Yes, JK Tyre and Industries and not MRF because psychologically it has become so difficult to buy that otherwise MRF is the best chart, just as Eicher Motors has become so difficult to buy, but JK Tyre and Apollo Tyres.
Q: Any of Bharat Forge or Motherson Sumi  that afford a strategy now, positional or intraday?
A: Not for today but otherwise both are buying opportunities. We need a small consolidation or dip to reenter both the stocks.
Q: Any bank other than SBI  for instance Axis Bank ?
A: SBI is the favourite because it has best chart. Axis Bank and ICICI Bank deserve. I assume that a trader can buy only so much, so the pecking order is SBI, ICICI and Axis Bank.
Q: All said and done the November series has gone off quite well for the market with the Nifty up above 4 percent odd. What is the sense you are getting about the December series?
A: December is usually an upbeat month, so in spite of the fact that we are at all time highs I would be upbeat on December.
Q: What are the chart checks on gold and crude?
A: Crude is only giving us the trend and the trend is down. There is no sign of a reversal, no sign of a base, nothing to suggest that the decline has come to an end. It will somehow. Gold’s chart is confusing because my sense is that gold is bottoming out, building a base. It has not done anything but if somebody wants a trade in gold then it will be on the long side.

Fresh from the success of Kaaviya Thalaivan, actor Nasser talks to Udhav Naig on how he found his redemption in cinema at a time of personal crisis and his long innings in the industry
Actor Nasser had barely spent a day on the sets of Kamal Haasan’s Uttama Villain when he heard the news of his eldest son Faizal having met with a horrific road accident which left him with serious internal injuries. Kamal Haasan then asked the massive set to be dismantled and postponed filming until Nasser was ready to face the camera again.
While Nasser stayed by his son’s side, the grief and helplessness soon got to him. “I didn’t have the strength to bear it. I wanted to be someone else for a few days,” he says, sitting outside his son’s room at the hospital. It was then that Nasser decided to go back to the film set. “The day I went back, Kamal shot a scene just because I was there. If not for his support and that of my friends and family, it wouldn’t have been possible for me to face it,” he says.
On the sets, he encountered  one of the toughest predicaments of his career. “I had to do comedy with Kamal Haasan, who is arguably one of the best in the business, when I was emotionally drained,” he says. “I had to lie down with my eyes closed for three hours for the “theyyam” make-up. I told myself, ‘Let me go and see if I can handle the situation. If not, I will return home,” he recalls.
The last time he faced this kind of uncertainty was three decades ago. He came to Madras as a 21-year-old with “unrealistic dreams”, to become an actor. “I was an idiot,” he says. Actor Nasser had the world standing against him: he was economically backward and a Muslim; everybody thought he looked too thin and possessed a big forehead; a nose, which, he says, was often compared ‘to a parrot’s beak’. “Some even suggested that I must consider learning stunts and that I would make a good henchman in movies.”
The only way to succeed was to compensate for all these apparent disadvantages by working on his craft. Ruminating on his struggle as an actor, he says, “There was a time when I couldn’t get two meals a day. But, many of my fellow Indians go through that kind of hardship. I faced religious discrimination occasionally, but when I was a struggling actor and literally had no place to sleep, a Hindu friend of mine let me sleep in his puja room. So, I wouldn’t consider these my struggles. For me, becoming a good actor was a real struggle, one that required a lot of hard work.”
He is an actor today because of his father, Mehaboob Basha, whom Nasser describes as a man with ‘strange’ ideas. “He was a conservative Muslim, but he always wanted me to be an actor. It’s a strange thing. Right from my younger days, he would fund local theatre groups just so that I could get a role. I didn’t know that he was grooming me then. I wanted to get a regular job which would pay my bills every month,” he says.
In fact, Nasser did manage to get a job in the Indian Air Force as an airman, which would pay him a considerable monthly stipend of Rs. 260. But his father’s wish that his son become a movie actor prevailed. Strangely enough, acting was never a passion for Nasser though his stint in theatre gave him a basic understanding of the craft. He came to Chennai and joined the Film Chamber and the Adyar Film Institute.
Having been introduced to theoretical concepts of cinema and the art of acting, Nasser wanted to understand the subject deeper. The more he read and experimented with the craft, the more interested he became. Along the way, he also became an idealist. After the initial days in the industry, he started developing a revulsion for the way the system worked. He felt his dreams of experimenting with roles came crumbling down. “I was told that I was being argumentative when I said this is not the way to do it,” he recollects. He did all kinds of odd jobs to keep himself afloat. He worked as a waiter at a five-star hotel, as a security guard and sought work in the television industry where he would get paid Rs. 75 for an episode.
The debut, however, came finally through K. Balachander, who gave him a role in his directorial venture, Kalyana Agadhigal. The film unfortunately flopped. “In those days, the industry cared deeply about good luck and bad luck. So, if someone had a flop in his/her first film, it was usually game over. Thankfully, writer Ananthu consistently offered me work in productions undertaken by Kavithalaya,” he says.
His first big break came in the blockbuster Nayagan, in which he played a small but a significant role. At the time, Nayagan was one of the most talked-about films in Tamil cinema. Touted as homage to The Godfather, Nayagan was directed by Mani Ratnam. By this time, Nasser had lost the exuberance and idealism of his youth. He had come to accept that he cannot change the system and did what most of us do: stop being a rebel and aspire for financial stability.
 “When I signed Nayagan, I had matured and made peace with the system. I understood that my knowledge of cinema or art of acting doesn’t guarantee my success. In fact, in many cases, I realised it was quite the opposite,” he says, further adding, “In those days, one couldn’t just approach directors directly for work. I had to meet the director’s associate. I thought I wouldn’t get it, but my portion was filmed almost at the very end of production. I just worked on the film for seven days and never realised that my career was going to change after this. Only after I saw the complete film, I realised how my character was crucial to the film.”
Nasser went on to collaborate with both Mani Ratnam and Kamal Haasan on other memorable films such as Roja, Bombay, Thevar Magan, Magalir Mattum, Kurudhipunal and many more. In the next two decades, Nasser’s stock as an actor steadily grew. For someone who had reconciled with the ‘system’, these were the films that let him do the kind of work he always wanted to.
He speaks at length about how actors in Tamil cinema ought to work. He says, “The ideal way is to have the script well beforehand, have the entire cast read the script together and do rehearsals. The actor must also be given the time to experiment with the character and interpret it in his/her own way. These things don’t happen in Tamil cinema.”
 Ask him about his collaborations with Kamal Haasan, Kurudhipunal in particular, in which Nasser played the role of a Naxal commander, he says it was one of those films in which he had the freedom to “interpret” the character. “I remember the sort of lengthy, in-depth discussions that Kamal, P.C. Sreeram and I had during the making of the film. Kamal was the author of the film. We used to look at the way the plot was structured from different perspectives, constantly debating on the hows and the whys of the narrative.” He adds, “I didn’t really ‘act’ in the film. The context of every scene was so well established, that I did nothing more than maintain a stoic expression in most scenes. The fact that my character was torturing someone and yet my face was so calm contributed to the impact.”
If the Uttama Villain experience has tested his mettle as an actor, Vasantha Balan’s Kaaviya Thalaivan seems to have taken him back to the days when he was a theatre actor. The cherry on top was the fact that Nasser’s character in Kaaviya Thalaivan was modelled on Shankar Das Swamigal, considered the father of Tamil theatre.
It gave him the opportunity to ruminate on the ‘what-ifs’ of life: “Thoughts like, ‘If I had stuck to theatre, what would have happened to me?’.” For someone who came from Chengalpattu to Chennai with nothing but unrealistic dreams, Nasser has had a glittering career. What does he feel about the newer crop of actors and filmmakers? He says, “The way actors are being handled has changed. It is both scary and exciting to work with youngsters. Either they have too much confidence in me or too little. They say, ‘Please do what I say’.”
After 29 years in the industry, does he not have the authority to do things he always wanted to do as a young actor? “I have strong, well-informed opinions on the craft of acting, but I can’t let that come in the way. It is very nice to work with the younger generation. I try not to disapprove and learn from them.”
But why? “Deep down, I think I am still the son of Mehaboob Basha.”

3 Hong Kong protest leaders to surrender to policePrint
Police officers clash with protesters outside government headquarters in Hong Kong Sunday, Nov. 30, 2014. Hundreds of pro-democracy protesters faced off with Hong Kong police late Sunday, stepping up their movement for genuine democratic reforms after being camped out on the city's streets for more than two months.Student protest leaders on Sunday night told a big crowd rallying at the main protest site outside government headquarters that they would escalate their campaign by surrounding the building.

Posted: December 2, 2014 3:39 pm
Three protest leaders in Hong Kong — two professors and a pastor— are calling for an end to street demonstrations to prevent violence and take the campaign for democratic reforms to a new stage.
Benny Tai Yiu-ting, Chan Kin-man and Chu Yiu-ming said they plan to surrender to police Wednesday to take responsibility for protests that have shut down parts of the Asian financial center for more than two months.
They represent only one faction of demonstrators. Most of the protesters are students.
They say their surrender also will serve as a silent denunciation of Hong Kong’s government.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India on Tuesday raised excise duties on petrol by 2.25 rupees per litre and on diesel by 1 rupee per litre with immediate effect, the finance ministry said in a statement to parliament.
The increases, which follow similar hikes in mid-November, seek to take advantage of a slump in world oil prices to shore up government revenues without stoking inflation.

Sensex slips 115 pts post RBI policy reviewMARKET UPDATE: Sensex slips 115 points post RBI policy review
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: December 2, 2014  | 16:36 IST

Markets fell for the second day with the benchmark Sensex declining over 115 points on Tuesday on selling in auto stocks after RBI kept interest rates unchanged for the fifth time in a row and IT shares dipped on strength in rupee.
In highly volatile trade, the 30-share BSE index fell to touch the day's low of 28,386.46 following announcement of credit policy. However, the index recovered briefly to hit 28,576.39 on RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan's hint of lowering rates early next year .
Participants later resorted to selling at every rise and the Sensex ended the day at 28,444.01, down 115.61 points, or 0.40 per cent.
On Monday, it had slipped 134.37 points. On similar lines, the NSE 50-share Nifty, after swinging to and fro, settled with a loss of 31.20 points, or 0.36 per cent, at 8,524.70. Intra-day, it traded in a narrow range between 8,504.65 and 8,560.20.
By not cutting rates, RBI has remained consistent in its policy objective of decisively bringing down inflation -and long term inflationary expectations.
Lower post policy bond yields show the market feels more confident that eventually rates will be much lower, said Arvind Sethi, MD & CEO, TATA Asset Management. Rupee, which had breached 62-mark against dollar in previous sessions, today strengthened to 61.87 levels.
This put pressure on shares of IT companies, including TCS and Infosys , which earn most of their sales in the US currency. Oil scrips also were on the sellers' list after excise duty on petrol was hiked by Rs 2.25 per litre and by Re 1 a litre on diesel but retail pump rates won't rise as oil firms have decided to absorb the duty change for the time being.
Over half of the 30 Sensex constituents ended with losses led by GAIL (down 2.85 per cent), M&M (2.47 per cent), HDFC (1.51 per cent) and Hero MotoCorp (1.48 per cent).
Sectorwise, BSE IT index suffered the most by losing 1.48 per cent, followed by Auto 1.05 per cent and Oil & Gas 0.66 per cent, among others. Global cues, however, were conducive as Asian bourses ended higher and Europe was better in its opening trades. Meanwhile, Foreign Portfolio Investors sold shares worth net Rs 12.36 crore on Monday, as per provisional data.

Akshar Patel targets World Cup spot
Akshar Patel has admitted that World Cup selection was at the back of his mind, though he is trying hard to take it one game at a time.

Delivering on his promise.When Akshar Patel traveled to Bangalore for a pre-season Under-19 camp at the National Cricket Academy three years ago, he aspired to be a batsman. Having been an opener for his district and state side in junior cricket, the boy from Nadiad, a small town in Gujarat, dreamt of making it big with the bat.
"But the coaches at NCA advised me to join the bowlers' group instead of batsmen since there were too many batsmen in the camp," Akshar told reporters after helping West Zone beat South Zone in the Deodhar Trophy semi-final at the Wankhede Stadium. "On hindsight, it has turned out to be a boon for me since my bowling has also improved a lot."
Despite being primarily in the bowling group, Akshar's skill with the willow did not go unnoticed. Dinesh Nanavati, V Venkatram and Mukund Parmar, seasoned coaches in domestic cricket who were working as consultants at the NCA then, all spotted his talent. As Parmar had told ESPNcricinfo earlier in the year, Akshar had all the ingredients to be a "valuable allrounder".
And Akshar is delivering on his promise. Having first emerged as a rising star of the IPL and then proving his credentials at international level by picking up 14 wickets from nine ODIs, Akshar has given a glimpse of his talent with the ball. Monday's knock would have eased the concerns of all the national selectors, as well as the chairman Sandeep Patil who watching from the sidelines.
When the selectors sit down to discuss the World Cup probables on December 4, Akshar is a certainty in the list of 30. In fact, he has now made a strong case to be picked in the squad of 15 which the selectors will pick in the first week of January.
Akshar admitted that World Cup selection was at the back of his mind, though he is trying hard to take it one game at a time. "Obviously it remains at the back of the mind, I am focusing more on the tournaments that I am playing. After this, we will be playing the Ranji Trophy and if I keep performing, there will be a chance of being picked for the World Cup."
For a 20-year-old, making a case for a World Cup spot may sound ambitious. But Akshar spoke more assertively than belligerently. He believes that his stint with the India squad has made him a more confident cricketer. "When Virat Kohli appreciates you, it helps. Being selected to play against Sri Lanka and my performance with the bat and the ball was good. Playing for India gives the confidence a boost and teaches you to play under pressure and it helps in matches like today."

Feminism is misunderstood: Freida PintoBy: Press Trust of India | New Delhi |
Posted: December 2, 2014 4:19 pm | Updated: December 2, 2014 4:53 pm
Indian actress Freida Pinto, who rose to fame with Oscar-winner ‘Slumdog Millionaire’, says the feminism advocates gender equality but is largely misconstrued as an anti-male concept. The 30-year-old actress says feminism is the need of the hour as gender bias is a sad reality today. “Feminism to me is equality. There is no man over woman and vice versa. Feminism is a very misconstrued and misunderstood topic.
“As soon as we say feminism, it does not mean all men should become subordinate and women should be the ones who rule the world. The only way we can have a progressive and successful country or world is when men and women treat each other as equals,” Freida told PTI. The young star says though men and women have different roles to play, they should complement each other rather than outdoing one another.
“There are certain roles that men play and others that women play. Our reproductive organs are different and clearly there is a reason why women carry the baby but that does not mean the man cannot help out with the caring of the child. “Father is as much a nurturer as the mother. I grew up with that equality so I can say people who understand feminism understand that men and women are equal but have different roles to play,” she said.

Second phase: 71% voters cast ballot in J-K  Jharkhand records 64.4% pollingComments
Voters walked on frost and through a blanket of fog to log an overwhelming 71% turnout in the second phase of assembly election in militancy-hit Jammu and Kashmir on Tuesday, just shy of the first-round figure.

Jharkhand, another insurgency-hit state to go to polls, recorded 66.38% polling despite this phase coinciding with an annual event of the Maoists’ military wing, the People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army.
People of both states defied fear of attack following poll boycott calls by separatists and insurgents, especially residents of frontier areas along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir where 80% polling was recorded in some booths. Kulgam, close to Shopian where back-to-back militant attacks on two sarpanches have rocked the area, showed its contempt for violence with an impressive turnout.
The only people complaining about the cold were the election staff stationed at a godown-turned-booth without heating and food. Voters kept themselves warm with traditional fire pots (kangri) and animated conversations on “change” — the leitmotif of this year’s poll.
“I voted for the Muslim United Front in 1987 but the government murdered democracy then. I picked up the gun and joined militant ranks, but even that didn’t change the political problem. I boycotted all the elections … today I am voting for change,” said 47-year-old former separatist Abdul Gani Lone, who is now a contractor.
Another former separatist, Sajad Gani Lone, who is the People’s Conference candidate for the Handwara seat, had stirred the poll pot calling Prime Minister Narendra Modi an “elder brother”.
In Jharkhand, the fate of two former CMs and three CM probables were sealed in ballot boxes. “We elect the CM, not merely an MLA,” said a BJP supporter in Kharsawan, where former CM Arjun Munda is contesting for a record fifth time.
A crow’s flight away, Chaibasa’s BJP candidate JB Tubid, a former home secretary, is tipped to be CM by dint of his tribal identity. Jamshedpur East and West have two of the BJP’s most powerful leaders and CM probables, Raghubar Das and Saryu Roy.
Former CM Madhu Koda, infamous for his alleged involvement in a multi-crore money laundering scam, is trying his luck from Majhgaon under the banner of Jai Bharat Samanta Party.
Voting was held in 20 constituencies, 16 of them reserved for schedule tribe candidates spread over seven districts. “The overall turnout was 59.46% in 2009 elections in 20 constituencies, which has now crossed the 66% mark,” an election official said, adding the percentage might partially increase after final figures arrive in a day or two.

Be the Closer: How to Start and End Conversations at Networking EventsBy Emily Miethner, Founder + CEO of FindSpark.
Starting and ending conversations at networking is without a doubt where most of that unavoidable networking awkwardness occurs. But it doesn't have to be that way. There's nothing wrong in going into an event with some intro and outro ideas up your sleeve.
If you think starting a conversation is hard, because it is, here's my favorite networking tip: Be the closer.
No one likes ending a conversation regardless of whether or not it's going well. If you take the initiative to end the conversation and move on, I guarantee the person you are talking to will be grateful. Do it before a conversation goes stale, or if it's stale from the start.
Want to take it a step further? Don't just close the conversation but take the person who you're talking to over to someone else you've met during the night and make a new introduction. Of course, you shouldn't just drop them off with no context. Start the introduction with what they have in common even -- if it's as small as what they majored in, where they went to school or what neighborhood they live in.
Plus, if you're able to make a good introduction at an event it also shows that you were listening.
Get the conversation started with these openers:
What brought you here tonight?
I love your (something they are wearing).
What did you think of the talk?
What (food/drink) are you getting? (While standing in line)
Hi! Just wanted to say hi!
Are you in line?
So, are you a __________? (Hofstra alumni, tea enthusiast, whatever the event theme is)
I couldn't help but overhear __________...
Make a clean exit with these closers:
You know what, I'd love to introduce you to someone else I met tonight.
I'm going to grab another (food/drink), fantastic to meet you.
I need to use the bathroom, but I'm sure I'll see you around.
I'm going to say hi to a friend, it was awesome chatting.
I don't want to take up all your time; it was great meeting you!
Well I'd love to stay in touch; can we trade cards?
I'm going to go mingle some more, but it was nice chatting.
How do you avoid awkward moments when networking? Share your tips in the comments!

Who Will Acquire Netflixreddit
After Netflix's stock dropped recently, billionaire Mark Cuban raised his stakes in the company on the conviction that the online video streaming service is a prime takeover target . Regardless of whether he's right, the more interesting question is: Who could be the most logical buyer?
With 50.1 million subscribers at the end of the third quarter, Netflix is an attractive target for a wide range of companies looking to leverage its large and growing subscriber base. The company has also made meaningful inroads into six European countries this year, expanding its global reach and brand name. Its moves to produce original programming like House of Cards and Orange is the New Black has also paid off handsomely.
But with a market capitalization of $23 billion and trading at a multiple north of a 100 times earnings per share, the company may be too expensive for most buyers. That narrows down the field of potential acquirers and demands a solid strategic rationale for a takeover.
Two obvious, and often touted, potential suitors are Amazon and Apple, which have the cash and appetite to acquire a company like Netflix. The problem, however, is that both Amazon and Apple have competing streaming video products that are established in their own right. Buying Netflix might save them money in content acquisition because of the overlap, but it could also cannibalize their existing offerings and possibly interfere with the strategic purpose those offerings serve.
While Amazon's 1.6 percent share of the streaming market is still small, it boasts a large video library and uses Prime Instant Video as a marketing tool to increase its paid membership for Prime. Along the same lines, Amazon is likely to make acquisitions that expand its Prime membership and keep customers hooked to the program for the long-term, or as in the case of its acquisition of online gaming site Twitch, buy companies that truly complement its offerings instead of doubling up on them.
Given this, the primary reason to buy Netflix would be to sell Prime to its subscribers. But since the average annual cost of Netflix (about $100) is the same as a yearly Prime membership of $99, and since consumers aren't likely to pay the fee twice, Amazon would be forced to bundle the two -- effectively giving away Prime for free to reach Netflix subscribers. It's also unclear how many Netflix subscribers already shop at Amazon (or could become shoppers naturally without a merger between the two companies).
What all this implies is that there is rationale for some type of marketing partnership between Amazon and Netflix, but not necessarily a merger.
By contrast, iTunes sells its content via downloads. Netflix's subscription model would be complementary to its service, but with a hefty 65 percent of the downloads market, it's hard to see why Apple would risk this revenue stream by offering subscription-based content that it can sell individually instead. Also, it's true that iTunes' revenue growth is slowing , but Apple's strategy of a self-contained universe of i-products has been so successful that it is unlikely to dilute its powerful branded platform by inviting an outsider into the family.
In addition, even though Apple has $155 billion in cash and securities on its balance sheet, it tends to use that money for share buybacks and for purchasing small companies primarily for their intellectual property or talent as opposed to sustaining its businesses. The $3 billion Beats acquisition was an exception but that has a lot to do with Apple's focus on music. This puts Netflix far outside of Apple's desired scope, at least for now.
Another potential acquirer could be Comcast, soon to be Comcast-Time Warner. The combination of Comcast and Time Warner, upon government approval, will create the biggest cable provider in the U.S. with 30 million subscribers. However, despite its market power, Comcast is now facing a growing challenge of consumers wanting to cut the cable cord. As services like Netflix, Hulu, and now even HBO and Showtime provide consumers with most of the content they want over the Internet, the traditional cable model is breaking down.
By acquiring Netflix, Comcast could bundle the company's video streaming portal with its own broadband access service, which might help it to replace customers that it loses on the cable side. A merger would also help Netflix, which was forced to pay a fee to Comcast to avoid being slowed down over the company's network.
Still, there are two wrinkles here. First, President Obama's recent call on the FCC to enforce net neutrality could prevent companies like Comcast from selectively slowing down Internet traffic and therefore obviate the need for Netflix to pursue a transaction with the cable operator, making the buyer more eager than the seller (although the head of the FCC has pushed back on the idea). In that situation, Comcast might have to pay a very large premium to obtain Netflix.
The other problem would be anti-trust approval. Ironically, the scope of the synergy between these two companies and the combined reach they would have makes this transaction highly improbable, if not impossible. Comcast's deal with Time Warner has drawn plenty of fire from market watchers with anti-competitive concerns stemming from such a mega-merger, and any further moves by Comcast down this road could be a non-starter for the Department of Justice.
That brings us to the most appropriate suitor for Netflix -- Chinese e-commerce behemoth Alibaba, which recently went public.
Flushed with cash after going public, Alibaba could potentially have up to $50 billion to spend. The company is also looking to grow through acquisitions in the U.S. More importantly, it wants to create a streaming video presence in China to compete with domestic players like Youku Todou and Sohu.com, and has partnered with Lions Gate Entertainment to launch a new service.
While Lions Gate is a successful movie and television producer and distributor, it has no experience in running an online content portal and is potentially limited in its content relationships unlike a pure-play distributor like Netflix. If Alibaba really wants to crack the streaming video market, it would benefit more from the technological and marketing expertise of the leading player in the space rather than start from scratch with Lions Gate.
It may be that Alibaba's goal isn't just to launch a new video service but to make a splash in Hollywood through production. But there too, Netflix could be a solid partner given its aggressive entry into series creation and now into movies as well. Netflix has also said that it will double its spending on original content in 2014, some of which could be channeled into producing exclusive content for China while the rest continues to support the U.S. and other markets.
In other words, by acquiring Netflix, Alibaba would gain a powerful brand name, a global streaming footprint (spanning 50 countries), and a plug-and-play operation for the $470 million Chinese online video market.
For Netflix's part, slowing domestic user growth means the company needs to expand actively into new markets , a point that CFO David Wells stressed during an investor event. While the Chinese market is not an easy one to navigate -- challenges range from government restrictions and piracy of content to hesitation from consumers to pay for online video -- Alibaba, with its size and local clout, could help Netflix succeed in that environment. And with its growing expenditures on original content and rapid push into international markets likely to cost a lot of money, Netflix could benefit from Alibaba's balance sheet.
Finally, with Netflix currently trading 20 percent down from its 52-week high, and the Lions Gate investment not yet complete, now would be a good time for Alibaba to explore talks. Given his long bet on Netflix, Mark Cuban would be happy.

Hirabhai meets CM over Kolis share inCabinetWritten by Tanvir A Siddiqui | Ahmedabad |
Posted: December 3, 2014 4:38 am
Gujarat Koli Sena leader and Rajula MLA Hirabhai Solanki met Chief Minister Anandiben Patel at her office in Gandhinagar on Tuesday afternoon to discuss issues concerning the community and the reported unrest among its leaders over representation in the state Cabinet.
About 20 prominent Koli community leaders also accompanied Solanki in the meeting that went on for half an hour.
“The meeting was held in a cordial atmosphere. The CM told us to wait for some more time in view of BJP Sangathan Parva (membership drive),” Solanki told The Indian Express after the meeting.
He said that he and his associates were satisfied with the government response. “Shanti rakho (have patience) was what the CM advised our leaders about a way out to resolve our grievances and promised to do the needful after the completion of the ongoing Sangathan Parva in the state,” he said.
The leaders who were present at the meeting with the CM included Leelabhai Dhaki, Babu Talsaniya, Haribhai Chaudhry, Rajabhai Chavda, Ramesh Makwana, Bhagwanbhai Dabhi, Rajdeep Jambucha, among others.
Solanki has been vocal since the Cabinet expansion by the CM on November 18 stating that the Koli community was not given due representation in the government despite its sizeable presence and political influence in the state.
However, his elder brother, Parshottam Solanki, did not agree with him in public, nor did he complain about being given a junior rank in the Cabinet. But younger brother Hirabhai continued with his rebellious views and went ahead with plan to hold a community convention at Bagodara on November 23 against the wishes of elder brother.

Quikr to shift from Mumbai to start-up hub B...Bengaluru
(The six-year-old company,…)
MUMBAI: Classifieds portal Quikr is moving its headquarters to Bengaluru from Mumbai to hasten the expansion of its technology team, becoming the latest in a line of companies that have migrated from the country's financial capital to the tech and start-up hub. "We want to double our tech and product team. It would have probably taken us 18-24 months in Mumbai, but in Bangalore we should be able to grow quicker," said Pranay Chulet , founder and CEO of Quikr.
The six-year-old company, which competes with South African media conglomerate Naspers' OLX in India, will make the transition over the next six months. It will, however, continue to keep 600 of its 800 Mumbai employees in the city. At its office in Bengaluru, Quikr plans to ramp up staff strength to 600 from 150 at present, with a bulk of fresh hires in the technology team.
"We are hungry for growth and its hard find technology professionals in Mumbai," said Chulet, an IIT and IIM alumnus.
Some of the other companies that have moved base to Bengaluru include online taxi booking firm Ola and online mobile recharge player FreeCharge. Joining them in by January will be two-year-old payment startup Instamojo.com. "We had an option of Bangalore or Pune, which is more of a satellite city to Mumbai. Bangalore houses most engineers from older generation platform companies like Akamai, Yahoo! and it makes a logical sense for us," said Instamojo cofounder and CEO Sampad Swain, whose company recently raised funding from Kalaari Capital .
FreeCharge decided to move base to Bengaluru last year for easy access to the city's tech and product talent pool. "Talent from other cities are averse to move to Mumbai due to cost of living and quality of life," said Kunal Shah , co-founder of FreeCharge. Online taxi booking firm Ola moved to the tech capital in mid-2012 as it was home to tech talent and also became the company's biggest market.
According to experts, while it does not bode well that startups like Quikr should leave Mumbai, it has been happening for tech companies for decades.
"Unfortunately, it is the reality of times, but Mumbai needs to buck up and keep businesses like Quikr in their fold. Around 20 years ago, Mumbai lost Wipro because best companies don't wait for things to improve," said Sasha Mirchandani, MD of Kae Capital, an angel investor in startups.
According to Quikr's Chulet, the shift is not a cost-cutting move to get cheaper talent, but a growthoriented one. The portal has raised over Rs 900 crore in funding this year from a list of investors that includes Tiger Global, Kinnevik, Matrix Partners India, Omidyar Network, Nokia Growth Partners, Norwest Venture Partners, Warburg Pincus and eBay Inc.
Other also agree, saying salaries in Bangalore are actually higher by 20-40% for top engineering talent.
"We have to compete with top global internet companies as well for talent," said Instamojo's Swain, who is ramping up his engineering team from 10 to 50 in the next six to 12 months.
According to experts, Mumbai can retain fast-growing startups by providing infrastructure as campuses need space. "Equally important is the fact that they need talent and enabling environment for students to stay back in Mumbai with affordable housing," said Mirchandani.

(RBI will allow banks to hold…)
MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India plans to allow banks to own more than 10% equity and go for longer repayment tenure while restructuring loans of stressed projects.
The central bank is also working with stock market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, to come up with a pricing formula for converting debt into equity in companies where loans are being restructured.
"In the next few days I hope to announce two measures towards 5:25 restructuring for existing projects which are standard and also to allow banks to take equity in restructuring to greater extent than what they currently can," RBI governor Raghuram Rajan said on Tuesday. A 5:25 structure allows banks to loan money to a developer for 25 years, with an option of rewriting the terms of the loan or transferring it to another bank or financial institution after five years.
Also, at present, banks can own maximum 10% equity in a restructured project. They were allowed to own more than that before May 2013.
"There is substantial financial stress still in some sectors," Rajan said. "We have been taking a holistic view keeping in mind the need for flexibility in financial restructuring while limiting the extent of forbearance," he said.
Banks in the recent past have burnt their fingers by converting part of their debt to Kingfisher Airline into equity, whereby they took a hit of Rs 500 crore. Lenders such as State Bank of India and ICICI Bank had converted debt amounting to Rs 1,400 crore into equity at a 60% premium to the prevailing market price. Lenders also wrote off debt worth Rs 7,000 crore given to the troubled airline.
Now, RBI is working closely with the market regulator to get the pricing formula right. "We are discussing the price at which this can be done with Sebi ," Rajan said.
"There are a large number of promoters who have taken genuine risks and got into trouble because economy was not so strong or because the projections were over-optimistic, sometimes even the capital structure was not appropriately structured, loans were too short term, and so on,'' said Rajan.
The projects, the governor said, need to be put back on track because these are valuable resources. State Bank of India chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya had requested the RBI that the 5:25 scheme — which allows longer loan repayment tenures for projects in infrastructure and core sectors — be extended to existing power projects. Such restructuring enables loan repayment to be co-terminus with cash flows from a project. It aims to improve debtservicing capacity and viability of projects.
Bhattacharya said that by extending the 5:25 scheme to existing projects an artificial disparity between them and upcoming projects can be eliminated. "When an asset gets stressed and when you are reworking the viability, the debt burden becomes too much. If you reduce the debt burden and let the projects flourish, ultimately you can pick up on the upside when a company goes for a listing or is taken over by some other company," she said.
Ram Sangapure , executive director at Punjab National Bank , said such a policy change would benefit banks such as PNB and SBI that have huge exposure to infrastructure projects.
"Many projects are stuck and promoters are not in a position to bring in their contribution. If bankers do not extend a helping hand now and contribute towards promoter equity, then probably these projects which are viable will not sustain," he said.
"In future we may not need this dispensation but in the next three to four years this will help revive projects,'' said Sangapure.

Item girls should be branded as prostitutes'Item girls should be branded as prostitutes'
PTI  New Delhi, December 03, 2014

A Hindu Mahasabha leader was on Tuesday at the centre of a controversy over his demand that actresses performing item numbers in films wearing "skimpy" outfits be branded as prostitutes, sparking an outrage.
The demand by Navin Tyagi, general secretary of the UP unit of Hindu Mahasabha, a right wing outfit, was condemned as "regressive" by political parties and the National Commission for Women (NCW).
Tyagi also sought a ban on wearing of skirts and jeans by girl students in schools and even said they should not be allowed to carry mobile phones.
"The girls who perform item numbers in films and remove clothes should be declared prostitutes. We feel the women who earn money by indulging in obscenity are prostitutes. They are spreading filth in society," Tyagi said, adding he will take the matter to the Supreme Court.
National secretary of the outfit Swami Chakrapani, however, distanced himself from the controversial remarks terming them as "wrong statement".
"We do not know about it. We are seeking details," he said. Asked about Tyagi's plan to take the matter to the apex court, Chakrapani said he was free to do so.
NCW chairperson Lalitha Kumaramangalam strongly condemned Tyagi's comments and said it will examine opposing such a move if he goes to the Supreme Court. "It is the usual regressive mindset that is coming out. One can turn around and ask what would they call the men who watch these women in their so called skimpy clothes. Anybody is welcome to go to the Supremne Court.
"But I have enough trust in the apex court to hope that they will crush and dismiss this sort of irrelevant opinion," she said. Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said he was shocked by the comments and said it was time the society wakes up.
"I am shocked by such parochial, obnoxious organisation who in their quest to govern the society come out with such dictate which were there in 15th Century and not even true for those centuries," he said. BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra also slammed Tyagi and said the party was for freedom of the society. "We are proud to have a culture where women have led from the front."

MP: BJP MLA thrashes 15 junkies for eve-teasing women32

Indore: A BJP MLA allegedly thrashed 15 junkies who he claimed were eve-teasing women in a park in Indore, the incident which acquired a political hue after Congress criticised saying it highlights the law and order situation of the state.
Eye witnesses claimed that BJP MLA Sudarshan Gupta beat up 15 miscreants at the Rukmani Devi Park near Malaharganj police station when women complained that the junkies had eve-teased them and school girls.
The women, too, reportedly joined the MLA and thrashed the drug addicts.
Eye witnesses claimed that BJP MLA Sudarshan Gupta beat up 15 miscreants at the Rukmani Devi Park near Malaharganj police station.

"These people have disturbed the peace in Malaharganj area. I have warned them that if they were noticed at public places henceforth, I will catch them and hand them over to the police," Gupta said.
Meanwhile, Madhya Pradesh Congress spokesman Narendra Saluja said the incident showed that the law and order situation in the state had turned grim in the BJP rule and illegal businesses like sale of narcotics thrive right under the nose of police.
Saluja, however, said that Gupta taking the law into his hands was incorrect. Like a law abiding public representative, Gupta should have ensured that the police took a stern action against the miscreants, Saluja said.
"Promt action will be taken if any such incident is reported to us by public in the Malaharganj area," Additional Superintendent of Police Aditya Pratap Singh said.

PM Modi critical of media interviews where aim is to get  pre-decided  answers62

New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi was on Tuesday critical of media interviews where questions are asked with the apparent aim of getting answers that is sometimes "pre-decided".
"In interviews, this is our experience. We have to reply at every roundabout and nook and corner. In most of the interviews, the person asking questions has already decided on the answers. He will not let you go unless you give him the answer he wants. Once you have given the answer they want, they lose interest in you," Modi said.
Earlier in the day, after facing the ire over the controversial remarks made by Minister of State Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, Modi had asked the Bharatiya Janata Party MPs to abstain from addressing the nation.

At the BJP Parliamentary Board meeting held on Tuesday, Modi had asked his MPs to avoid making uncalled for statements. He also condemned the comments made by Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti.
While asserting her point and exhorting people to vote for the BJP, Niranjan had on Monday said that everyone including Muslims and Christians are sons of Ram. She also went ahead and added that those who do not believe in this ideology, do not belong to India.
She had to later apologise for her comments in Parliament after opposition parties trained guns against her for her controversial statement.

One southbound lane of G W Parkway reopens as sinkhole repairs continue(Related:  Commuters react to sinkhole that caused major delays on GW Parkway )
Updated at 9:16 a.m.
After 12 hours of crews working to fix a pothole that shut down the southbound lanes of the George Washington Memorial Parkway, federal highway officials said they ‘ll now try to figure out what caused the problem.
The roadway’s southbound lanes between Route 123 and Spout Run Parkway were closed all day Tuesday after a sinkhole was discovered Monday night. Crews arrived on the scene around 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday and finished fixing the roadway around 8:30 p.m. the same day. But a small portion of the roadway was still closed in the early morning hours Wednesday because the asphalt was drying in the wet, damp conditions, according to officials at the Federal Highway Administration.
The entire stretch reopened shortly after 6 a.m. Wednesday. On Tuesday, the closure of the roadway caused traffic delays throughout the morning rush hour.
Federal highway officials said Wednesday that they are not immediately sure what caused the sinkhole but are looking into it.
“They were focused on fixing the problem rather than studying it,” said Doug Hecox, a spokesman for the Federal Highway Administration, which was in charge of helping fix the pothole. He said there could be a variety of reasons for sinkholes, including water accumulating underneath the roadway or “changing geological conditions way, way underground.”
“They’re not easily predictable,” he said. He said the 12-hour fix was “especially fast when you consider all the weird weather.” Typically, it is a bit faster and easier to fix roadway problems with asphalt when it is warm and dry.
Updated at 6:06 a.m.
All of the southbound lanes on the George Washington Memorial Parkway are now open after a sinkhole shut it down Tuesday.
Updated at 4:30 a.m. Wednesday
Some of the southbound lanes of the George Washington Memorial Parkway reopened early Wednesday morning, but some work remains on part of the roadway as crews continue to fix an area where a sinkhole erupted.
A sinkhole had led to the shut down of all southbound lanes at Route 123 all day Tuesday.
In a Twitter message, the U.S. Park Police said that the GW Parkway “is open – one right lane closure SB at Windy Run is in place. All lanes will be open for morning commute.”
Around 4:30 a.m., the police said that crews were finishing up some work on the GW Parkway at Windy Run. Drivers can only get by in that section in the right lane at this time, they said.
Both of the southbound lanes on the parkway are expected to fully reopen soon, although police said they did not have a specific time on the reopening. Late Tuesday night, highway officials had said the roadway’s southbound lanes would fully reopen by 5 a.m.
The Tuesday shutdown of the parkway caused major traffic delays in the morning commute.

Updated at 9:30 p.m.
One southbound lane of the George Washington Memorial Parkway was reopened Tuesday night after repair of a large sinkhole which shut down the lanes at Route 123 since Monday night.
However, the U.S. Park Police said that one southbound lane of the parkway remained closed at Windy Run. Sgt. Lelani Woods said it would reopen at 4 a.m. Wednesday.
Updated at 4:01 p.m.
As work continued to repair a large sinkhole on the George Washington Memorial Parkway, Federal Highway Administration spokesman Doug Hecox said he expected the road would be entirely open to traffic by 5 a.m.
Updated at 12:46 p.m.
Work is underway to repair a large sinkhole on the southbound lanes of the George Washington Memorial Parkway at Route 123, and officials now say they expect the roadway to reopen before Wednesday morning’s rush hour.
“The backfilling is underway,” said Doug Hecox, a spokesman for the Federal Highway Administration. “We have equipment ready to begin the paving as soon as the backfilling is finished.” He said the sinkhole is being backfilled with dirt and rock.
“The current estimate,” Hecox said, is that the parkway would reopen “tomorrow before rush hour.” But he cautioned that he did not know exactly when that would be and that officials still needed to coordinate with the U.S. Park Police, the agency that helps oversees the roadway.
The southbound lanes of the GW Parkway in that area have been closed since early Tuesday morning and created a headache for commuters, with some people reporting drives of up to three hours to reach their destinations.
Hecox said federal highway crews that are now at the site have found that the sinkhole is “not as large as it was originally estimated to be.” Officials now say the sinkhole measures 10 feet by 5 feet.
Updated at 11:05 a.m.
Federal Highway officials said it is likely to take crews more than five or six hours to fix a large pothole that closed the southbound lanes of the George Washington Parkway at Route 123 on Tuesday morning.
Fixing a sinkhole of this size typically takes five to six hours — if conditions are dry and warm. But with the cold temperatures and rainy conditions, it is expected to take longer. Officials said that means it is likely that the parkway’s southbound lanes will remain closed through Tuesday evening’s rush hour and could be closed into Wednesday morning’s rush hour, as well.
“With the cold, it is likely all of the work will be done late tonight,” said Doug Hecox, a spokesman at the Federal Highway Administration. He said it will be up to the U.S. Park Police to decide when to reopen the road. Just before 11 a.m., Sgt. Lelani Woods, a spokeswoman for the park police, said in an e-mail: “It is still unknown as to how long the closures will be in effect, however, with weather permitting repair efforts can begin soon.”
One problem in fixing the sinkhole, highway officials said, is that it depends on how the asphalt reacts with the wet weather.
“Asphalt requires warmer weather and prefers drier weather,” Hecox said. “When you have water and colder weather, it complicates the behavior of the pavement.” He said crews may have to put asphalt down in chunks and may have to go back over it with a paver several times.
Federal highway officials said that roughly 60,000 vehicles a day travel that segment of the George Washington Parkway. They estimate that roughly 100,000 vehicles were affected by the closure of the GW Parkway on Tuesday morning.
Hecox said that when that portion of the GW Parkway is “out of commission, those drivers are forced onto other routes.”
“It could be that 100,000 drivers are inconvenienced by this little hole,” he said. “It is all the more reason for us to work quickly.”
He said a crew of roughly a dozen people is working to repair the roadway. “It is a heavily traveled route,” Hecox said. “We can’t afford for that road to be closed for that long.”
He said the Federal Highway Administration learned of the sinkhole around 7 p.m. Monday. Crews had to wait until daybreak Tuesday to get a better sense of the size of the hole and figure out what equipment would be needed to fix it.
The exact cause of the sinkhole is unknown, but Hecox said it could be “due to geological structures underneath” or potholes. He said the recent warm — and then cold — temperatures in the area can also create something that is known as a “freeze thaw,” where pavement expands and contracts. “That can aggravate existing potholes and make it bigger,” he said.
Updated at 9:58 a.m.
Highway officials said the George Washington Parkway southbound lanes will likely remain closed for Tuesday evening’s rush hour and not reopen until Wednesday morning.
At 9:54 a.m., Federal Highway Administration officials said equipment was coming from another project on the Clara Barton Parkway and work to fix the sinkhole on the GW Parkway’s southbound lanes at Route 123 would begin “within the next hour.” Officials said workers would begin to remove pavement and backfill the hole Tuesday afternoon.
Doug Hecox, a spokesman at the Federal Highway Administration, said the conditions of rain are “not favorable” for fixing and repaving the sinkhole. But he said, “given the tens of thousands of drivers that cont on that route, we’re going to pave in the rain anyway. It will be a rough, ugly patch.” He said it is possible that the southbound lanes of the parkway could open Tuesday but “for now, we anticipate it will be open Wednesday morning.”
Officials also closed the ramps on Interstate 495 of both the inner and outer loops to southbound George Washington Parkway at Exit 43 until further notice so crews could repair the roadway.

Earlier post:
A sinkhole has closed the southbound lanes of the George Washington Parkway at Route 123 Tuesday morning and caused several miles of traffic backups in the surrounding area. The roadway will be closed in the southbound direction until at least noon, federal highway officials said.
The southbound lanes are closed between Route 123 and Spout Run Parkway.
The hole at its surface, according to U.S. Park Police officials, measures roughly six feet wide by three feet long. But federal highway officials said their engineers have found that the size of the hole below the surface is larger. Hecox said just before 9 a.m. that the sinkhole measures 25 feet wide by 3 feet wide “from one side to the other side.” He said there is a “bigger void below the visible hole.”
“You’re just seeing the top of the hole,” Hecox said. Engineers on the scene, he said, are saying the sinkhole is 25 feet wide “from the furthest part of the void.”
“It is a big empty spot,” Hecox said. “There is a larger hole. A lot of that is underneath the pavement and you can’t see it.”
The sinkhole was discovered around 7 p.m. Monday when there was a crash involving four vehicles along the parkway, according to Sgt. Lelani Woods, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Park Police. There were no reports of injuries. Woods said it is possible that the hole may have started as a pothole and gotten larger because of weather conditions.

On Tuesday morning, there were reports of several miles of backups on the GW Parkway and some surrounding roads. U.S. Park Police  advised drivers to use alternate routes into the District, including Clara Barton Parkway, Route 50 and Glebe Road. But some drivers reported traffic was backed up along those roads as well.
Metro said its buses in the Rosslyn area are having to take alternate routes because of the sinkhole problem. At 8:30, its buses on the 15K and 15L routes were running up to one hour late in both directions.
“Traffic is backed up,” Woods said. Traffic southbound on Route 123 is bumper-to-bumper and commuters are seeing tail lights, as far back as Interstate 495, she said. Drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Virginia Department of Transportation officials said just before 8 a.m. that there were roughly four-mile backups along Interstate 495 north as a spillover from the GW Parkway closure.

A major stretch of the southbound lanes of the George Washington Memorial Parkway in Arlington and Fairfax counties is closed Tuesday morning because of a large sinkhole.
The sinkhole developed Monday night. The GW Parkway is closed between Route 123 and Spout Run Parkway. The sinkhole is located just south of Route 123.
The closure is expected to last through Tuesday morning’s rush hour, according to the U.S. Park Police. The northbound lanes of the parkway are open.

As minorities look up to the government, the Centre has ordered a thorough probe into the fire at St. Sebastian’s Church. The incident is being seen as an attempt to orchestrate communal tension
Members of the Christian community and its leaders held a protest demonstration near the Police Headquarters at ITO here on Tuesday morning, blocking traffic during peak hours, to register their anguish at the alleged burning of St. Sebastian’s Church in Dilshad Garden.
Catholic nuns, principals and teachers of various educational institutions were among those who participated in the demonstration that blocked the arterial road linking New Delhi with East Delhi for at least two hours.
Delhi Archbishop Anil. J. Couto noted that the church will maintain a “wait and watch policy” to see how the Central and State Governments pool in their efforts to find the culprit before deciding the next course of action.
“The alleged burning of the church has created a sense of insecurity, and the government has to show by its action that it is concerned and will ensure security of all minorities in their motherland, especially the small Christian community which has been living peacefully for 2,000 years,” noted a release issued by the Delhi Catholic Archdiocese.
Stating that the government has to end targeted violence and impunity so that the Constitutional guarantees of freedom of faith for all citizens were seen on the ground, the Archdiocese release noted: “We are hoping the Prime Minister and his government will reaffirm this commitment.”
The protest rally at ITO was addressed by Archbishop Anil Couto and senior representatives and clergy of several denominations.
St. Sebastian’s Church in Dilshad Garden was constructed in 2001 and is among the biggest churches in the area. The fire was reported on early Monday morning and the entire interiors including the altar, and the Holy Bible and the Cross were reduced to ashes.
Hours after the incident, senior officers of the Delhi Police, the Special Branch and the Forensic Crime unit came to the spot and samples were retrieved from the inside of the church, which still smelt of fuel oil.
“We have been told that the police have not been able to crack the case yet. Also, apart from the judicial inquiry, the government must repair the building before Christmas, ensure that the policemen guilty of dereliction of duty are punished, and special police investigation teams are set up to trace the guilty,” added Archbishop Couto.
Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman P. J. Kurien and CPM member K. N. Balagopal also visited the church on Tuesday.

I think netdo that a tempo is being built up by Indian defense industry and ministry to prepare the general public about an imminent increase of the defense budget in February 2015. It would not have been necessary if the congress st useless PM and defense minister had bothered about Indian defense for the past 10 years. We are really in a bad situation as far as Submarines are concerned. The Indian Air force has come down to 33 squadrons instead of 39  squadrons. If we talk about limited warfare on two fronts at the same time then we need 50  squadrons of the best fighting air force fighters. The army has no proper artillery since 1986 i.e after bofors. Hence I see a lot of requirement is presently there. Hope the Indian industries benefit, with that more people will be employed and more knowledge gained in technology in collaboration with foreign companies. Infrastructure will hence improve too.China and Pakistan may not exactly be a bogie as they are trying desperately to corner India economically and militarily.

Re-launched Kisan Vikas Patra offers 8.67% interestStory
Kisan Vikas Patra gets a new life
To increase domestic savings, the government has re-launched Kisan Vikas Patra, or KVP, a small savings scheme it had discontinued in 2011.

To increase domestic savings, which fell to 30% of gross domestic product, or GDP, in 2012-13 from the peak of 36.8% in 2008, the government has re-launched Kisan Vikas Patra, or KVP, a small savings scheme it had discontinued in 2011.
The re-launched KVP offers 8.67% interest and will double the principal during its maturity period of 100 months.
Though the investment matures in eight years and four months, one can redeem it after the lock-in period of two years and six months and thereafter in a block of six months by getting a pre-determined maturity value.
KVP certificates will be in denomination of Rs 1,000, Rs 5,000, Rs 10,000 and Rs 50,000. There is no cap on the amount that can be invested.
Initially, the certificates will be sold through post offices. Later, they will also be available at designated branches of public sector banks.
The certificates can be bought singly or jointly and can be transferred to any person/persons multiple times. The facility of transfer from one post office to another anywhere in India is also available. One can also avail of a loan against the certificates.
Investors must note that the interest earned will be taxable. However, tax will not be deducted at source. Besides, the investment is eligible for income tax deduction.
In order to prevent the use of KVP by money launderers, investors will have to follow the know-your-customer (KYC) norms that apply to all national savings schemes.
According to Anil Rego, CEO and founder, Right Horizons, bank fixed deposits have similar risk but are much more liquid. Hence, he will not recommend KVP to investors, he says. Public provident fund , or PPF, can be an alternative to KVP for investors with taxable income if the long tenure of the PPF is not a concern. Post-tax returns from PPF are the best among all small savings schemes.
"One can also consider investing in tax-free bonds and non-convertible debentures with good credit rating. These are offered by companies at higher coupon rates," says Rego.
{mosimage}Investors also have the choice of the National Savings Certificate, which offers a rate of 8.5% for five years and 8.8% for 10 years. This investment, too, is eligible for tax deduction under Section 80C.
Prior to the advent of mutual funds, gold deposit schemes, etc, investing was synonymous with small savings schemes offered by the government. Such was the popularity of these schemes that the percentage share of KVP collections was in the range of 9% to 29% of collections under all national savings schemes.
Until recently 2010-11, gross collections under the scheme were Rs 21,631 crore, which was 9% of gross collections during the year. In the year it was closed, the scheme got Rs 7,575.95 crores (April 2011 to November 2011).
KVP's popularity can be attributed to the safety and security it offered. Investors also liked the returns offered by the scheme, wherein the amount invested doubled during the maturity period of 5» years (the maturity period of the scheme when it was launched), which translated into a return of 13%. According to Rego, investors liked the concept of doubling of money. The government is hoping that this simple positioning will work with investors who are not very evolved this time too. Further, the investor did not have to quote his PAN, which was also an incentive.
However, it was discontinued in 2011 as the government wanted to rationalise small savings schemes. Also, without PAN, there was risk that the KVP will be used for money laundering.

Microsoft to acquire email app AcompliMicrosoft to acquire email app Acompli?

A post published on Microsoft's official blog by Corporate Vice-president Rajesh Jha may have inadvertently revealed that the company is acquiring email startup Acompli.
The Verge in its report said the post, titled "blank post please delete", gave no hint of the acquisition but the text in its web address read: "microsoft-acquires-acompli".
The blog post has now been taken down but not before its screenshot had been captured by some.
The web link, which looked like an early draft of an announcement erroneously published on the website, indicated that a deal between the two companies is complete or in its final stages.
The Verge said if it turns out to be true, Microsoft would be acquiring a powerhouse email app that is referred to as the "Outlook for iPhone that Microsoft hasn't yet built."
Acompli also introduced its app and a new "focused inbox feature" to Android last year, shortly after raising $7.3 million in investment.

Gold tumbles after Swiss referendum; oil hits 5-year lowGold tumbles after Swiss referendum; oil hits 5-year low

Tokyo, Dec 1:  
Gold prices tumbled on Monday after Swiss voters overwhelmingly rejected the proposals to boost gold reserves in a referendum, joining the broad rout in commodities that sent oil prices to five-year lows and copper to four-year lows.
Sinking oil and commodity prices are causing massive realignments in markets, hurting assets tied to the resource sector, from Australian mining shares to the Malaysian ringgit, while benefiting importers such as Japan and China.
Swiss says "NO" to #gold ... @ $1148 now Charts turn ugly..$1000-$950 next???
— Gurumurthy K (@gurukmurthy) December 1, 2014
MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.0 per cent, with resource-heavy Australian shares hitting a six-week low.
Gold fell more than two per cent at one point to $1,142.90 per ounce, its lowest level in more than three weeks, while silver also took a hit, falling more than six per cent to a five-year low below $14.50 per ounce.
Swiss gold reserves
The Swiss measure, had it been approved, would have compelled the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to more than double its gold reserves and banned it from ever selling the metal, threatening its ability to defend a €1.20 euro on the Swiss franc imposed at the height of the euro zone crisis.
The Swiss franc dipped to 1.2042 on the euro from 1.2018 at the end of last week, though the Swiss currency is supported by investors who still regard it as one of the safest currencies in the world. It last stood at 1.2036.
“The result should of course temporarily relieve the pressure on the SNB’s currency floor, albeit whilst doing little or nothing in our opinion to reverse the fundamental downward trajectory of EUR/CHF,’’ said JPMorgan analyst Paul Meggyesi.
Oil at 5-year low
Oil prices hit five-year lows, unable to find a bottom despite their biggest fall in 2 1/2 years last week after OPEC held back from cutting output in the face of a supply glut.
US crude fell more than two per cent to a five-year low of $64.10 per barrel, with the fall from June exceeding 40 per cent.
Copper also fell to as low as $6,230.75, piercing below its March low to hit its lowest levels since mid-2010.
The Australian dollar fell more than one per cent to a four-year low, of $0.8417, and so did the Malaysian ringgit, which fell to 3.424 to the dollar.
Chinese manufacturing data
Adding salt to commodities’ wounds, Chinese official manufacturing data suggested growth is slowing in China, demand from which has supported commodity prices for years.
Deflation fears
Sliding oil and raw material prices have stirred deflation fears in the euro zone and Japan, cementing expectations that the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan will take more steps to support their respective economies.
The dollar, taking advantage of such concerns, attracted bids against the euro and yen.
The euro was slightly weaker at $1.2437 after having fallen on Friday on data showing annual inflation in the euro zone cooled to five-year lows of 0.3 per cent in November.
ECB stimulus measures
Many traders expect the ECB may signal further action later this week to ward off deflation.
The dollar also hit a seven-year high of 119.03 yen and the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, rose to 88.451, a four-year high.
“Given that the Fed is going to raise rates next year, the monetary policy divergence should support the dollar,’’ said Osao Iizuka, head of FX trading at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank.
The yen’s fall and lower commodity prices helped Japanese shares, with the Nikkei rising to seven-year highs. Mainland Chinese shares also gained, with Shanghai Composite Index hitting a three-year high.

FBI Investigating Sony Pictures HackFBI Investigating Sony Pictures Hack
Reuters
reddit
BOSTON/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Sony Pictures Entertainment has hired FireEye Inc's Mandiant forensics unit to clean up a massive cyber attack that knocked out the studio's computer network nearly a week ago, three people with knowledge of the matter said on Sunday.
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation is also investigating the incident, said one of the people, who were not authorized to publicly discuss efforts to deal with the attack.
The computer systems at the Sony Corp unit went down last Monday after displaying a red skull and the phrase "Hacked By #GOP," which reportedly stands for Guardians of Peace, the Los Angeles Times reported.
Technicians are making headway in repairing damage caused by the attack and expect to have the email systems back online Monday, said the source who commented on the FBI investigation.
Sony executives have declined to comment on the scope of the attack, though emails have been bouncing back with messages asking senders to call employees because the system was "experiencing a disruption."
Representatives with FireEye and the FBI declined comment.
Mandiant is an incident response firm that helps victims of breaches identify the extent of attacks, clean up networks and restore systems. The firm has handled some of the largest breaches uncovered to date, including the 2013 holiday attack on Target Corp.
Technology news website Re/code reported on Friday that Sony was investigating to determine whether hackers working on behalf of North Korea have launched the attack in retribution for the studio's backing of the film "The Interview," which is to be released on Dec. 25 in the United States and Canada.
The movie is a comedy about a CIA attempt to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The Pyongyang government denounced the film as "undisguised sponsoring of terrorism, as well as an act of war" in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.

Trinamool targets BJP  says Amit Shah involved in Sahara scamTrinamool targets Amit Shah, says he is involved in Sahara scam
Trinamool Congress members alleged that a red diary recovered from Sahara chief Subrata Roy names Amit Shah.
Yahoo India –  Mon 1 Dec, 2014

NEW DELHI: Reeling under BJP president Amit Shah's scathing attack on West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee at her home turf in Kolkata, the Trinamool Congress, afraid of losing ground to the BJP which has demolished many a regional party in state polls, retaliated by staging a walkout in the Lok Sabha seeking answers from Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the recovery of a diary concerning the Sahara group, which allegedly mentions Amit Shah’s name.
Trinamool MPs came near the speaker's podium, carrying a red-coloured diary which had "Sahara" written on it and raised slogans of "Narendra Modi jawab do".
Speaker Sumitra Mahajan, however, proceeded with the question hour.
"They (Trinamool MPs) have decided not to follow the rules," she said.
After protesting for a few minutes, the Trinamool MPs staged a walkout.
Trinamool MPs also staged a protest at the gate of the parliament building demanding BJP president Amit Shah should be named in the Sahara scam and also raised the issue in the Rajya Sabha.
Trinamool Congress members alleged that a red diary recovered from Sahara chief Subrata Roy names Amit Shah.
Raising the issue in Rajya Sabha, Trinamool member Derek O'Brien demanded a discussion over the CBI's investigation against Amit Shah in the Sahara scam.
The members also flashed symbolic red diaries with Sahara written on them.
"We want to raise an issue sir, very important issue. Name of Amit Shah appears in a red diary found from the Sahara chief," he said.
However, Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju dismissed the TMC's accusations as a political stunt.
"These are all false speculations and allegations. What the TMC said is a political stunt, and it is not correct," said Rijiju.
On Sunday, virtually kicking off the poll campaign for the 2015 municipal polls and the 2016 Assembly elections at the Uthhan Diwas (Day of Rising) celebration, Shah launched a scathing attack on the state government over the Saradha scam, Burdwan blast and illegal Bangladesh immigrants.
Shah asked the people of Bengal to uproot Trinamool in the next Assembly elections in 2016. He said: “Mamata should answer who bought her paintings? She should answer why Shymal Sen commission was not allowed to work. …She started vote bank politics by protecting the Burdwan blast accused. You (Didi) are objecting to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) probe in the Burdwan blast? Who made you CM of Bengal — the people of Bengal or Bangladeshi infiltrators? She has to answer all these.” (Agencies)

Jewellery stocks shine after RBI scraps 80:20 to ease goldimportsDirect equity set to top FDs as biggest asset class in FY15: Report
Investors seem to be enthused by RBI’s surprise move to scrap curbs on imports of the yellow metal. On Monday shares of jewellery retailers rallied anywhere between 3 -20%. The RBI on Friday unexpectedly removed the 80:20 scheme, under which jewellery makers had to mandatorily export 20% of the imported gold before placing further shipments.
Titan, the biggest retailer by market value climbed as much as 8% during the day trade, before closing at R389.65, up 5.3%.
Shares of three jewellery firms including Tribhovandas Bhimji Zaveri, Gitanjali Gems and Shree Ganesh Jewellery House rose to their daily limit of 20%, as the combined wealth of investors in these firms grew by R325 cr.
Tara Jewels and Thangamayil Jewellery just stopped short of hitting upper circuits, up 18.5% and 19.3% respectively. Rajesh Exports gained as much as 8.2% in intraday before closing with a 3.4% gain. Renaissance Jewellery and PC Jeweller rose by 2-3% each.
Titan sawthe biggest single day gains since August 21. On Monday IIFL upgraded the stock to ‘buy’ from ‘add’ with a target price of R450 per share.

Column: Can we now stop worrying about oil pricesGST will boost  e-commerce
Many years ago, as a young hippie manqué in New York, I found myself at a United Nations Environment Program conference where I was labelled a Luddite by one of the conveners for spouting off some “save the earth” stuff. I had no idea what that meant so I looked it up—this is years before Wikipedia—and learned (slowly) that Ned Ludd was a textile worker in the early 19th century Holland (I think) who tried to sabotage weaving machines by throwing his wooden shoes into the warp of the mechanised looms. He inspired several followers—the Luddites—who were, in short order, led away in chains and tears.
Technology won and, as so ably described by my friend Gopal in a recent article, it always does. The victory may take time but, once the genie is out of the bottle, there’s no turning back. The big trick, though, is to ensure a fair balance between who pays the costs and who gets the benefits of any new technology. This, of course, is about politics, which is why there is so much money influencing politics all over the world.
These thoughts were triggered by last week’s continuing—and possibly accelerating—collapse in the price of oil after the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) voted to keep production levels unchanged. It appears that the large oil producers have taken a strategic call to suffer the pain of lower prices to try and force the Johnny-come-latelys—the shale oil/gas producers in the US—to their knees. The thinking is that several shale oil deposits will be unprofitable to exploit at $70 a barrel; a much larger number will fail at $50 a barrel; and if the price stayed at or around that level for long enough—how long?—it would result in sharply reduced investment in these alternative exploration initiatives, ultimately leading to lower supply and higher prices.
It all sounds pretty far-fetched to me. First, nobody knows exactly how market prices move. Second, even fewer people know how long is long enough or what price is low enough—let’s also remember that money is almost free these days. In other words, as the old adage goes: markets can remain irrational a lot longer than anyone (including OPEC) can stay solvent.
And solvency is an increasingly critical issue. Non-OPEC Russia, for instance, is already in emergency mode, with the sharply lower oil price exacerbating the pressures created by Putin’s adventurism. Additionally, most large oil producers (including Saudi Arabia) need oil to be north of $100 to balance their budgets. In fact, $50 or $60 oil for, say, three or four years, would play havoc with their budgets, leading to impossible-to-call outcomes.
Perhaps the most important is that sooner or later Saudi/Wahhabi adventurism will have to take a cut, boding wonderfully well for a new Islam that has been trying to express itself ever since the Arab Spring. Oil prices at the time were around $120; and while it may be arcane to find a link between the two, I firmly believe there is. Indeed, a year ago (a more Islamic world—November 2013), I had forecast that “…oil over the next ten years will be lower—and possibly much lower—than the average price over the past ten years, which (Brent) was under $80 a barrel…”
Of course, I have no idea how much lower oil prices will go or for how long they will stay subdued. And the nature of markets ensures that there will be corrections.
However, the nature of technology ensures that this downward pressure will not ease up. Almost by definition, technology constantly evolves, improving itself—recall Moore’s law. Thus, it would seem natural that shale oil extraction technologies, too, will keep improving efficiencies to where they can survive even lower oil prices.
Other technologies, too, are on a tear. For instance, in the US, wind energy already provides nearly 5% of US electricity demand and, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the contiguous United States has the potential to generate onshore wind power that is nine times larger—you read that correctly—than current US total electricity consumption. Solar, while growing more slowly, is another important alternative. And then there are hydrogen-powered cars, the Tesla (which is already a reality) and who knows what other techno-wonders, all of which will continue to structurally reduce demand for oil.
More and more it appears that the petroleum era, which began in the 1970s and during which oil prices drove a lot of thinking, seems to be ending, a natural victim of evolving technology.
Allahu Akbar!

Editorial: Good job on goldSugar prices under pressure over Brazilian dumping
After months of suspense during which RBI was discussing further curbs on gold imports, the government did well to do away with the 80:20 curbs last week. As FE has pointed out before, the curbs, including the hiking of import duties, served no purpose. While India hiked duties from 4% in February 2012 all the way up to 8% in June 2013—in steps of 2% each—gold demand rose from 202 tonnes in Q1-2012 to 310 tonnes in Q2-2013 since the rise in global gold prices made the investment worth it despite the hike in import duties. Once gold prices started falling globally, a response to faster US GDP growth and the declining taper essentially, Indian demand also slowed—investment demand for gold, measured by the demand for gold bars and coins, has fallen from 64 tonnes in Q1-2012 to 42 tonnes in Q3-2014. Hiking import duties and putting in artificial curbs like the 80:20 rule only hiked the premium on gold prices in India, and even fuelled demand to beat what always looked like another impending import curb. With gold import curbs gone, news reports suggest de-hoarding of gold stocks is taking place. A 10% import duty, in this context, means that those who had bought gold before the duty hike spiral began in 2012 are getting a 10% premium over what they should normally have got. Take that away, and watch the price fall even more.
Despite the fall, however, India’s imports of gold are still very large at 639 tonnes in the last 12 months, and does cause a problem with the overall import burden. Crushing this demand, however, is no solution. Indian households traditionally buy gold for a variety of reasons; two important ones are the lack of know-your-customer (KYC) norms and the lack of viable investment options. With inflation running above even fixed deposit rates, where else were households expected to invest? Had the government come out with enough CPI-indexed inflation bonds for the retail sector, possibly the demand for gold would have fallen even earlier. Though Kisan Vikas Patras have been reviled as a hoard for black money, their easy KYC was certainly a factor in their popularity—to that extent, bringing them back is probably a good thing.

Editorial: Fixing FCIGovt considering 6 FDI proposals in single-brand retail
With the Food Corporation of India (FCI) sitting on well over two-and-a-half times the wheat and rice stocks it needs to have, it is not surprising, as FE reported on Monday, that the corporation should have several tonnes of rice that is yet to be returned to it by the millers—the stock is worth over R10,000 crore. Indeed, larger amounts are probably rotting each year in FCI’s godowns since it does not have anywhere near the capacity it needs to store the grain, more so when the procurement season peaks—at its peak in June 2012, stocks had risen to 82 million tonnes. Apart from the wasted stock, there is the money blocked in the procurement, the higher costs of procurement incidentals and the impact on the market prices. FCI had 69.5 million tonnes of buffer in October 2012 compared to the norm of 21.2 million—it had 59.5 million tonnes in October 2013 and 53 million tonnes in October 2013. Over 30 million tonnes of buffer means a locked up value of about R50,000 crore; while higher procurement incidentals drive up the costs of wheat and rice in the market, this is worsened by the fact that with FCI mopping up most supplies in critical states, there is little left for the private trade to buy and sell.
Given how many committees have been set up to suggest how to fix FCI—there was even a study given to McKinsey & Co—there can’t be too many solutions left to be tried. Scientific stocking techniques, more covered granaries, first-in-first-out are obvious solutions that need to be implemented, but the real solution can only lie in limiting procurement by FCI. As long as FCI has 2-3 times the grain it needs, stocking it is going to be costly and a problem. More important, with the direct benefits transfer being tried out, there is no reason why FCI should be carrying out unlimited procurement anyway. NSS data shows there is a big problem in even states such as Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu where the PDS is supposed to be running well. While over 71% of the rice bought by the poor in 2011 was from ration shops in Tamil Nadu, it was an impressive 48% in Chhattisgarh—the figures were 50.6% and 18.2% in 2004 for the two states, respectively. What’s important, however, is the quantity bought. Between 2004 and 2011, the poor reduced rice consumption from 11 kg to 9.8 kg in Chhattisgarh and from 8.9 kg to 7.7 kg in Tamil Nadu. So, if the 250 million poor in India were to be given a subsidy of R100 per month—@R20 per kg for 5 kg of wheat/rice that the Food Security Act promises—that would add to R30,000 crore compared to the R1.5 lakh crore spent by FCI on procuring 60-70 million tonnes of foodgrain each year, even half of which does not reach the really poor. Any FCI solution that does not address the issue of procurement is a waste of time.

State VAT: Back to square oneWill cheap gas last?
The amendments made in the Punjab VAT law and the Kerala VAT law have made the trade and industry wonder as to rather than inching towards a unified goods and services tax (GST) regime, are we back to square one?
The Punjab government, being concerned about the substantial compliance gap in taxation at the wholesale and retail levels and to plug any revenue loss from leakages down the supply chain, issued plethora of notifications amending the Schedule A (tax-free goods) and Schedule E (goods taxable at special rates). Schedule A amendments include addition of certain commodities that are tax-free at the wholesaler or distributor or retailer stage, provided that the tax has already been paid at the first point of sale, i.e. manufacturer or first importer’s stage.
These very goods have been added in Schedule E to be taxed at the first point with a higher rate—around 7%, 16% and 25% (in case of cold drinks). Now, what are these goods? These are the ones which are bought by general public every other day. These include, at a very broad level, cold drinks, mineral water, personal care products, soaps and detergents, branded or packaged food products, processed fruits and vegetables, drugs and medicines, consumer electronic goods, kitchen appliances and so on.
These amendments take us back to the pre-VAT days, where the tax base was very narrow as the tax was levied on the first point of sale and, hence, the value added after the first point was not subjected to tax. Since the tax was levied only at the first stage, there was a tremendous opportunity for evasion and avoidance of tax. To curb this, many state governments introduced border check posts for tracking inter-state movement of goods and link them up with the declarations filed by the dealers. The tax applied on the actual selling price of the first point distributor creates a risk of competitive distortions where one distributor makes a sale to a related distributor at a low price, and the second distributor resells the goods to wholesalers/retailers at a higher price.
Since the wholesaler or distributor or retailer will not be paying tax on the commodities if the tax has been paid by the manufacturer/first importer at the first stage, the implications of tax on inter-state sales also become critical. The Punjab government has issued a clarification that CST provisions will be applicable to the manufacturers/first importers as earlier. If any subsequent dealer makes an inter-state sale of these goods, the tax liability will be nil. Accordingly, the input tax credit will not be available to him. This provision effectively denies the benefit of zero-rating of inter-state sales to wholesalers and retailers. This is a serious issue which tantamount to one state exporting its taxes to another state. The Punjab government has gone back in history, which has landed them in the pre-VAT era, posing a challenge for the trade and industry. All these changes have created a very complex situation in the state of Punjab, particularly for those dealers simultaneously dealing in goods which are taxable at the first point, those which follow the VAT system, those under the optional MRP scheme and those which are tax-free. It has created administrative complexities for such dealers. For example, a retailer would find it extremely difficult to manage the inventory from the manufacturers/first importers who have paid tax at the first stage and those who are not subject to the first-stage taxation, let alone design a system for correct computation of the tax payable. It is a move back to the single/first-point tax that prevailed prior to 2005 and goes against the very fundamentals and spirit of the VAT system. In fact, it was to put an end to the distortions in the first-point sales tax system that the VAT was introduced in 2005.
Down south, in Kerala, a levy of a turnover tax (TOT) at the rate of 2% on textile products excluding ready-made garments which are exempted under the state VAT law has been introduced in the last state Budget. Dealers having a turnover of R1 crore or more are liable to pay the TOT on the turnover of textiles (excluding ready-mades). Dealers are not allowed to collect the tax from the consumers and are expected to pay it from their margins. Again, this scheme of levying a TOT is very much against the universal concept of VAT and is cascading in nature. The dealers tend to increase the prices if they have to maintain their margins resulting in increase in the prices of textile products in the state of Kerala.
The changes effected by the Punjab and Kerala governments have set a bad precedent for the other states who, in the interest of revenue, may be tempted to adopt such measures. More importantly, these changes are clearly a breach of a common understanding arrived at by the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers almost a decade ago and are against the spirit of unification of tax systems in India. Time is opportune for the trade and industry to highlight such aberrations that exist in the current VAT system. While one cannot prevent the states in adopting such measures given their fiscal autonomy, it is always wise to impress upon them the advantages of continuing with the VAT principles which work well in other parts of the world.

Monetary policy: How much can RBI ease? RBI may preserve headroom to close CPI-WPI divergence in moving towards medium-term, 4% inflation target

Wonkblog: A simple guide to oil prices  collapseBy Chris Mooney December 1 Follow chriscmooney

Oil prices  dropped further  in trading overnight before appearing to recover  some of the losses, as part of an ongoing energy market roller-coaster that has seen prices for West Texas Intermediate crude oil -- often used as a benchmark of U.S. prices -- drop below $70 per barrel  for the first time since 2010. In recent months, markets have seen a  dramatic price slump  for oil, which cost over $100 per barrel as recently as June.
The shift has markedly reduced average U.S. gasoline prices (which are now well below $3 per gallon ) and may bolster the U.S. economy heading into the Christmas spending season -- by putting considerably more money in consumers' wallets.
But what's driving this slump -- which is quickly becoming the single most important economic story of 2014 (and maybe 2015)? There's one short-term reason and three longer-term reasons.
The most immediate reason is that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries -- a  group of 12 nations including Saudi Arabia, Iran and Venezuela that holds enormous power over global energy markets, producing 40 percent of global oil supply  --   decided  on Thursday not to cut production at their meeting in Vienna.
Credit: NASDAQ .
The meeting was the most important in years, because it came amid a pre-existing slump in prices. Everybody wanted to know if OPEC would take any action to halt the decline. It didn't -- presumably because its members decided it was wiser to weather the current storm -- and crude oil prices immediately tanked.
The long term reasons include booming U.S. and world oil production, little demand in Europe and Japan, and improving automobile fuel efficiency standards.
1) Booming U.S. and world oil production. Even as OPEC kept production steady, it has been growing elsewhere. The United States, most of all, has seen a major growth in oil production, thanks to the shale oil revolution, in which new technologies like horizontal drilling have allowed access to hydrocarbons deep beneath the Earth's surface.
The figures from the Energy Information Administration are truly dramatic: Almost twice as many barrels a day of crude oil are being produced now in the U.S., versus the mid-2000s:
Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration .
Production of oil has also been up in  many other countries . Canada increased its crude oil production from just over 2.5 million barrels per day in 2009 to over 3.3 million in 2013, and Russia increased from about 9.5 million barrels per day in 2009 to over 10 million barrels per day over the same time period. Libya, meanwhile, is bouncing back after production tanked in 2011 due to the country's civil war.
In sum, there's just more oil out there for people to buy, which is having a predictable effect on prices, pushing them downward.
2. Little demand in many regions including Japan and Europe. There's also the fact that while the U.S. has recovered steadily from the Great Recession, many other countries have not. They're struggling, and that is dampening oil demand.
In  Europe , for instance, while total petroleum consumption averaged over 15.3 million barrels per day in 2009, it was under 14.3 million in 2013, and has dropped further since.
There's a similar story to be told about Japan:
Source: U.S.  Energy Information Administration .
3. Strides in vehicle fuel efficiency. In the U.S., we're also using less fuel in our cars because those cars are more efficient . The sales-weighted fuel economy of vehicles in the U.S. increased from 20.8 miles per gallon in 2008 to 25.3 miles per gallon in 2014.
Here's a figure from the Energy Information Administration that captures the trend:
So in sum, it would seem that the trend in oil prices is  due to that most basic of economic factors: Supply and demand.
So what happens next?
Does the slump continue, or is it possible we've already overshot and are due for a reversal in oil prices? We can't be sure, but there are some reasons to think a bounceback could be possible, especially if there's a European economic recovery. And in the long term, overall fuel consumption is definitely  projected to increase, not decline, out towards 2040 -- driven largely by demand in developing nations.
For shale oil in the U.S., permits for new wells dropped 15 percent in October, the first sign of a slowdown, according to Reuters. Sliding oil prices have also hurt prices of U.S. corporate junk bond funds. (Reuters)

Unsafe bedding threatens nearly 55% of US infants: StudyYoga as good as aerobics for reducing heart disease risk
More than half of infants in the United States are being placed to sleep with bedding that puts them at greater risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), researchers warned in a report today.
The National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other institutions found that despite regular warnings, unsafe bedding threatened nearly 55 per cent of infants.
Cuddly toys and loose bedding, such as thick blankets, quilts and pillows, can obstruct an infant’s airway and pose a suffocation risk, the NIH has warned.
The organisation has reiterated safety guidelines that infants should be placed to sleep alone, on their backs, on a firm sleeping surface such as a mattress in a safety-approved crib, covered by a fitted sheet.
The research found that unsafe bedding use dropped sharply from 85.9 per cent in 1993-1995 but remained high at 54.7 per cent in 2008-2010.
“Parents have good intentions but may not understand that blankets, quilts and pillows increase a baby’s risk of SIDS and accidental suffocation,” said the study’s first author, Carrie K Shapiro-Mendoza, of the CDC’s Division of Reproductive Health in Atlanta.
The study, published online in Pediatrics, is an analysis of data taken from the National Infant Sleep Position Survey (NISP), which collected information on the influence of infant sleep position and safe sleep recommendations on infant care practices.
The survey collected information from a random sample of more than 1,000 caregivers in US households between 1992-2010.
Study author Marian Willinger said parents often received “mixed messages” about the kinds of bedding to be used with infants.
“Relatives may give them quilts or fluffy blankets as presents for the new baby, and they feel obligated to use them. Or they see magazine photos of babies with potentially unsafe bedding items. But babies should be placed for sleep on a firm, safety approved mattress and fitted sheet, without any other bedding,” she said.
SIDS is the unexplained death of a child within the first year of life. The rate of SIDS in the United States has fallen 50 percent since 1992, amid a welter of campaigns to raise awareness about safe bedding practices.
However, the decline has slowed since 2000 while the number of other unexpected infant deaths from causes such as accidental suffocation or entrapment in bedding material has increased.

Ferguson shooting: Obama asks police to use body cameras  says don t want  militarised  police cultureBy: Associated Press | Washington |
Posted: December 2, 2014 12:42 pm | Updated: December 2, 2014 3:27 pm
President Barack Obama asked federal agencies on Monday for concrete recommendations to ensure the U.S. isn’t building a “militarized culture” within police departments, as he promoted the use of body cameras by police in the wake of the shooting of an unarmed black teen in Ferguson, Missouri.
With protests ongoing in Ferguson and across the country, Obama spoke to reporters at the end of a White House meeting with police, civil rights activists and local leaders and acknowledged the participants told him that there have been task forces in the past and “nothing happens”. “Part of the reason this time will be different is because the president of the United States is deeply invested in making sure that this time is different,” Obama said.
Obama said he was upset to hear the young people in the meeting describe their experiences with police. “It violates my belief in what America can be to hear young people feeling marginalized and distrustful even after they’ve done everything right.”
At least for now, Obama is staying away from Ferguson in the wake of the uproar over a grand jury’s decision last week not to charge the police officer who fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown. Violent protests and looting erupted after the decision, resulting in at least a dozen commercial buildings being destroyed, despite Obama’s pleas for calm.
In tandem with the meeting, the White House announced it wants more police to wear cameras that capture their interactions with civilians. The cameras are part of a $263 million spending package to help police departments improve their community relations. Of the total, $74 million would be used to help pay for 50,000 of the small, lapel-mounted cameras to record police on the job, with state and local governments paying half the cost.
Pushing back on concerns the task force would be all talk and no action, Obama said this situation was different because he was personally invested in ensuring results. He said young people attending the meeting had relayed stories about being marginalized in society and said those stories violate “my idea of who we are as a nation”.
“In the two years I have remaining as president,” Obama said, “I’m going to make sure we follow through.” U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder traveled to Atlanta Monday to meet with law enforcement and community leaders for the first in a series of regional meetings around the country. Obama asked Holder to set up the meetings in the wake of clashes between protesters and police in Ferguson.
Speaking at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta – the church where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. preached – Holder said that he will soon unveil long-planned Justice Department guidance aimed at ending continued…

HPL shutdown makes downstream units look abroadHPL shutdown makes downstream units look abroad
Arindam Majumder | Kolkata Dec 03, 2014 12:48 AM IST
The prolonged shutdown of Haldia Petrochemicals (HPL) has severely affected companies in the allied sector such as plastics processors. HPL, one of the largest manufacturers of high-density polyethylene in the country, supplies different grades of polymers mainly in the eastern India region.
The long closure of HPL has disrupted the supply of polymers to plastics processors, especially the makers of the injection-moulded products such as syringes, crates, buckets, filaments, etc. As a result, many of such units had to close down.
The HPL shutdown led to the closure of nearly 150 such units, rendering thousands jobless, said Ramesh Kumar Rateria, vice-president of Indian Plastics Federation. However, due to a prolonged shutdown, the units have decided to import polymer. “We are prepared for a life after HPL,” he said. The plant is closed since July 6 due to the failing of the naptha cracker unit, the main unit of the plant.

He added the shutdown of HPL has also helped other smaller players to rake up business in the eastern region. “Dhunseri Petrochemicals, which was a smaller company, is growing to be a major player now,” said Rateria. The plant resumed operations in early October after a fire accident had forced it to shut down.
According to industry estimates, HPL had a share of 12.8 per cent of the polymer industry in the country when it was operating at an optimum level.
The future of HPL, east India’s largest refinery, still remains under cloud after a board meeting ended without reaching any final conclusion. The principal stake holders, West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) representing the state government and The Chatterjee Group (TCG), met on Monday but no decisions were taken about resuming operations at the plant.
“Nothing has been decided about the reopening of the plant. The status-quo remains,” TCG chief Purnendu Chatterjee told Business Standard after the board meeting. Although the state government did not make any official announcement, it was reported that TCG had agreed to buy 520 million shares (30.8 per cent) of WBIDC at Rs 25.10 apiece, matching the price offered by IOC after the government invited Expression of Interest last year. The share transfer, however, could not take place as Chatterjee is yet to pay the first instalment.

Now  Tiger Woods is Hero s global brand ambassadorTiger Woods is now Hero MotoCorp's global brand ambassador

India's two-wheeler giant, the Hero Group , has signed American golf legend Tiger Woods as its brand ambassador in a four-year deal that targets capturing new markets in North America and Europe.
The deal, for an undisclosed amount, can be termed as the biggest for an Indian manufacturer in terms of association with a global icon is concerned.
Interestingly, the announcement has come two days before the start of the prestigious PGA event World Challenge, which is hosted by Tiger Woods Foundation and Hero MotoCorp as the title sponsors.
"We have gone beyond the Hero World Challenge and we will also have Tiger Woods as our corporate partner for the next four years starting from December 1," Pawan Munjal, Managing Director, Hero Motocorp Limited, told a select media gathering in Orlando (Florida).
"It is an endorsement deal with Tiger Woods in which he will not only be partnering but also promoting Hero as a brand across the globe," Munjal said adding that "It is not just for the US market."
Hero Group is world's largest two-wheeler manufacturer but still considered only a domestic player. Joining hands with Woods is clearly a move to create a space at global level. The 38-year-old golf legend is a 14-time major championship winner, second only to Jack Nicklaus (18).
Asked what made them choose a player, whose reputation took a beating five years back due to his infidelity scandal, Munjal said they have taken a very "conscious" decision.
"Let me tell you, we are absolutely thrilled to be in a partnership with Tiger. Hero and Tiger together represent the best in our respective professions. Whatever happened is now all behind him. He went public, apologised for what has happened and he is back in the game," Munjal said.
"People are back with him, many corporates are back with him and obviously Hero took a very conscious call," he added, explaining the move.

Rupee gains 14 paise to end at 61.88 versus dollarStory
Forex Update: Rupee gains 14 paise to end at 61.88 against US dollar after RBI policy review

The rupee on Tuesday gained 14 paise to close at 61.88 against the Greenback on increased selling of the US dollar by exporters and banks even as stock markets fell.
Selling of the American unit by exporters and some banks for the second day in a row amid sustained capital inflows supported the rupee even as the US dollar gained in global markets, forex dealers said.
"Rupee appreciated by almost quarter per cent taking cues from the positive comments given by the RBI during the announcement of credit policy," Pramit Brahmbhatt, the CEO of Veracity Group, said.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) kept its key policy rates unchanged in its fifth bi-monthly monetary policy review and made dovish comments regarding rate cut as early as March 2015 if disinflationary process set in.
At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market, the rupee commenced better at 61.99 against the US currency from its previous close of 62.02 and immediately touched a low of 62.02 on weak local equities amid a firm dollar overseas.
Later, the domestic unit bounced back on dollar selling by exporters and some banks to a high of 61.87 before concluding at 61.88, logging a net rise of 14 paise (or 0.23 per cent).
Meanwhile, the benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) index Sensex plunged further by 115.61 points while FPIs/FIIs picked up shares worth US $64.04 million on Monday.

Rajan opens door for rate cut early next yearRajan opens door for rate cut early next year
BS Reporter | Mumbai Dec 03, 2014 12:59 AM IST
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Raghuram Rajan on Tuesday held interest rates steady but held out hope for industry by saying the central bank could ease monetary policy early next year — even outside the policy review cycle — if the downward momentum in inflation continued and fiscal developments were encouraging.
“(It is a) misconception among corporates that RBI is unconcerned about growth,” Rajan said at a press conference after the policy review. But keeping up with his inflation-warrior image, Rajan defended the status quo, saying he did not want to do a “flip-flop” on this front and was looking for “certainty” on various factors, primarily inflation, before lowering the key interest rate. “We have to make sure the disinflation process is well underway. We have had a couple of months (of low inflation) after five years of high inflation. We want to make sure this is for real, especially because we don’t intend to flip-flop,” he said.
The repo rate was kept unchanged at eight per cent, a fifth straight bi-monthly monetary policy review at which the status quo was maintained. RBI also kept the key ratios — the cash reserve ratio and the statutory liquidity ratio —unchanged.
The decision was broadly in line with expectations, as most economists and market analysts had expected the repo rate (the rate at which the central bank lends to banks) to remain unchanged, given the governor’s insistence on quelling inflation first.

In a statement, the finance ministry said in the weeks ahead, the government and RBI would work towards a monetary policy framework that would help institutionalise the gains achieved on the inflation front. “The government looks forward to RBI supporting the revival of growth and employment,” the ministry said.
Most analysts, however, said RBI’s idiom had changed from whether it would cut rates to when. The central bank’s next policy review is scheduled for early February and most expect it will either cut interest rates then or wait until April.
State Bank of India Chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya said by advancing the inflation target of six per cent to March 2015, RBI had now sent out a clear message that the rate cycle would be reversed sooner rather than later. With oil prices at historic lows, a stable exchange rate and strong capital inflows, the feel-good factor is here to stay.
HDFC Bank’s research team said a repo rate cut could be announced in April next year, as by then, the central bank would get more clarity on the pace of disinflation and the Union Budget could help RBI get a better handle on the government’s commitment to fiscal consolidation and its reform agenda.
“Still, weak demand and the rapid pace of recent disinflation are factors supporting monetary accommodation. However, the weak transmission by banks of the recent fall in money market rates into lending rates suggests monetary policy shifts will primarily have signalling effects for a while,” RBI said.
At the press conference, Rajan put it more bluntly: “It is not my job to tell banks what to do. Though rates have come down, they have not passed it on.”
RBI has set a target of eight per cent retail inflation by January 2015 and six per cent a year from then. In October, retail inflation had hit a lifetime low of 5.52 per cent (the series was launched in February 2012), while Wholesale Price Index-based inflation slumped to a five-year low of 1.77 per cent, driven by softening prices of fuel and food items.
With Consumer Price Index-based, or retail, inflation already within RBI’s target, Rajan had earlier hinted he would like to tackle the issue once and for all. Also, the overhang of a weaker-than-normal monsoon, which could put pressure on food prices, has not been entirely ruled out.

In its statement, RBI mentioned the need to revive capital investment, and called on the government, which will announce its Budget for 2015-16 in February next year, to “stay on course” to meet fiscal deficit targets. These targets have been jeopardised by weak tax revenue growth and the slow pace of selling stakes in state-run companies to raise funds.
Tuesday’s decision, however, is likely to disappoint Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who has been batting for lower interest rates to further boost economic growth, as well as sections of Indian industry.
Rajan also said corporate groups are often asked to pay higher interest rates because of their poor financials and inability to repay existing dues. “I also see there is a whole lot of confusion. The immense risk premium being demanded of some corporates is because of the state of their leverage, because of the risks they have taken, and because of their inability or unwillingness to repay. This should not be attributed to RBI. What we control is risk-free rate, what they can control is the risk premium demanded of them. This is something they should work on, even as we are working on bringing down inflation and the risk-free rate they have to pay,” Rajan said.
The RBI kept its central estimate of growth at 5.5 per cent, while scaling down its inflation projection to six per cent by March-end next year. In the medium term, RBI expects inflation to stand at about six per cent, assuming a normal southwest monsoon, lower crude oil prices and no change in administered prices barring electricity. The RBI governor also said the central bank was in the process of finalising the monetary policy framework, adding the government seemed comfortable with adopting a target of about four per cent, with a band of +/-2 per cent beyond 2016.
After having done away with gold import curbs through the week, Rajan didn’t sound too concerned about the high imports of gold, saying the fall in crude oil prices created some room in the current account. The move to do away with the 80:20 rule on gold imports was initiated from the government’s side and was a “reasonable” one, he said.
Industry was disappointed. Ajay S Shriram, president of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), said at this juncture, even a symbolic cut in policy rates would have sent a strong signal. “CII feels the RBI will move in favour of growth at its next monetary policy and the new year will witness a cut in policy rates by at least 50 basis points,” he added.
The stock markets also reacted negatively, with the Sensex falling 116 points. But government bond yields dropped  and fell below the eight per cent mark, owing to dovish statements by the central bank. The yield on the 10-year bond ended at 7.97 per cent, compared with its previous close of 8.06 per cent.
 

BS Banking Round Table: Liquidity-flush banks ready to fund growthBS Banking Round Table: Liquidity-flush banks ready to fund growth
BS Reporter | Mumbai Dec 03, 2014 12:58 AM IST
With the economy seemingly close to turning around, aided by a pro-reforms government at the Centre, leading bankers have said they are ready to fund growth, though investment in new projects could take another 12 months.
On a day when the central bank maintained status quo on interest rates, the bankers, speaking at the Business Standard Banking Round Table here on Tuesday, refuted the logic that bank funding was coming in the way of growth.
“To say that growth is not coming because banks are not financing is wrong. We have more than enough liquidity to fund if a project is good,” said State Bank of India Chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya.
Union Bank of India Chairman and Managing Director Arun Tiwari agreed. “We are enablers and have enough capital,” he said.
According to bankers, the number of new projects had significantly come down since 2011. “Just two months ago, we saw the number of non-infra projects had fallen from 17 to three. So, it is more a question of getting projects off the ground than financing,” Bhattacharya said.

In this context, bankers saw initiatives from the government, be it pushing stalled projects or the fresh auctioning of coal blocks, as steps in the right direction. “We are definitely seeing more government focus on clearing some of those bottlenecks. For instance, the coal auctions were very well thought through. We are seeing all the right signals,” said Axis Bank Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director Shikha Sharma.
The recent surge in capital flows into India has made bankers optimistic about growth picking up. “Next year, we expect things to be better. We will expect earnings growth in the range of 16-17 per cent next year. India is on a growth trajectory,” said Deutsche Bank India Chief Executive Officer Ravneet Gill.
Bankers, however, said there was a need to improve credit discipline in the Indian corporate sector and introduce stricter laws, which existed in developed countries. Banks have been seeing a surge in non-performing assets through the past few years.
“We need something on the lines of a chapter 11 (of the US) here. If a project becomes unviable or if takes a hit, the equity should take the hit first and if the company still suffers, they have to leave. There have to be laws to enforce that,” said HDFC Bank Managing Director Aditya Puri.
The government is planning to amend the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act during the ongoing winter session of Parliament to effectively deal with the issue of bad loans, especially those resulting from suspected wilful defaults.
On the constraints faced by banks, Citi India Chief Executive Officer Pramit Jhaveri said there was an urgent need to look at the priority sector lending regime foreign banks faced in India.
C S Ghosh, chairman and managing director of Bandhan, which has secured an in-principle approval to set up a bank, said the challenge was twofold: training its 14,000 employees to become bankers and proving to the world that “we can become a bank”.

Sebi  i-bankers discuss revival of IPO marketSebi, i-bankers discuss revival of IPO market
Jayshree P Upadhyay | Mumbai Dec 02, 2014 10:46 PM IST
Despite a 35 per cent rally in the equity market, India Inc has managed to raise only less than Rs 900 crore, lowest in more than a decade, through four initial public offerings (IPOs) in 2014. This was the main topic of discussion at the Primary Market Advisory Committee (PMAC), a Sebi (Securities and Exchange Board of India) expert panel, meeting held on December 1, sources said.
At the meeting, the capital market regulator sought feedback from industry players on why there are few companies coming forward with IPO plans, despite encouraging investor appetite.
According to the Sebi data, less than 20 companies—most of them small—have currently filed their offer documents with the regulator for IPOs.
According to sources, the investment banking community told Sebi they were taking more time to vet offer documents in the wake of recent orders over inadequate disclosures in certain IPOs. The regulator last week had penalised six investment bankers handling the CARE IPO for disclosure lapses. Also, in October, Sebi had also barred DLF from accessing the capital markets for three years over violation of disclosure norms during its 2007 IPO.
Whether the move to allow Indian companies to list overseas will lead to an export of domestic IPO market was another topic of discussion at the meeting.
Industry players asked Sebi to ensure that companies don’t take advantage of any regulatory arbitrage under the new norms.
Bankers told Sebi a lot of Indian companies might consider listing on overseas bourses such as London’s Alternative Investment Market (AIM), where the regulatory and disclosure norms are less stringent.
The government has recently amended the depository receipt regulations to enable overseas listing of Indian companies without the prerequisite of domestic listing. Although no company has yet tapped this route, experts say issuers might be attracted to some overseas platforms, where disclosures aren’t very strict.
“Platforms such as AIM, which do not have particular minimum admission criteria in terms of company size, prior trading record, number of shares required to be in public hands or minimum market capitalisation, could attract lot of issuers,” said an investment banker.
According to a source, Sebi is considering reducing the regulatory arbitrage that small entities could enjoy on overseas platform.

Gilt investment cap for FIIs would be raised: RBIGilt investment
(Reserve Bank of India Governor…)
MUMBAI: Seeking to assuage foreign investors' concerns on caps in government bonds, Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan today said there is a roadmap for expansion but appetite of foreign investors will not be a deciding factor.
"We have in mind a schedule for expansion, so that it is consistent with our ability to absorb that kind of capital. I'd say don't despair, we will expand the limits, but it has to be not at the pace that the market wants, but as per our ability to absorb the kind of inflows that will come in," Rajan said during the post-policy call with analysts.
The country had last expanded the foreign investment limit in G-secs in July by $5 billion to $25 billion, and reports say the yield-chasing investors have already exhausted a bulk of the new addition.
Citing the recent case of a bond issuance by state-run telephony player MTNL which saw higher interest from foreign investors, Rajan said this is because the troubled company's bond issue was looked at as a quasi-sovereign instrument.
Meanwhile, deputy governor HR Khan said the RBI has also come across investments by the foreign investors into the G-secs in "indirect" way, wherein they are using the debt and liquid mutual funds to enter G-secs as also short-term debt like commercial papers and certificates of deposits, which is not allowed at all.
However, he said the quantum of these investments is not very large and the RBI is watching the situation.
"We are keeping a watch. If it becomes substantial, we will be taking action," he warned.
On the inflation indexed bonds (IIBs), which were re-launched last year to garner greater amount of financial savings, Khan said there is a move to redesign the product for institutional investors.
For retail investors, Khan acknowledged that other instruments like the recently introduced Kisan Vikas Patras are there, but stressed that IIBs still hold value in a portfolio.
On the banks' high appetite towards lending to the recession-proof retail segment, Rajan said the RBI brass has repeatedly expressed concern over the industry not getting the the required amount of credit.
"Lending to retail cannot be seen as a new panacea, I think banks are taking cognisance," Rajan said, hoping that banks will start pushing credit to corporates once the demand picks up.

Shares decline as RBI holds key policy ratesShares decline as RBI holds key policy rates
BS Reporter | Mumbai Dec 02, 2014 10:49 PM IST
Shares fell for a consecutive day on Tuesday after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) decided to leave key policy rates unchanged. Traders were seen reversing long positions created last week in anticipation of a cut in interest rates. However, markets found comfort in the signal given by the RBI that rates might be cut early next year, helping recover some of the losses.
The S&P BSE Sensex touched a low of 28,386, falling 160 points, or 0.6 per cent, immediately after the policy announcement on Tuesday. However, it recovered from the lows to end at 28,444, down 115 points or 0.4 per cent. The NSE Nifty hit a low of 8,504 but closed at 8,524.7, down 0.36 per cent. Last week, benchmark indices had rallied 1.2 per cent on rate cut expectations.
Participants said certain sections of the market had factored in a rate-cut based on the improvement in the inflation data and the GDP growth numbers. “There was a good amount of expectation build-up last Friday across counters, particularly in those of the PSU (public sector units) and private banking sector stocks. That led to some amount of unwinding of long positions as some sections of the market did expect rates to be cut,” said Yogesh Radke, head of quantitative research, Edelweiss Securities.
After an initial sharp drop of one per cent, the CNX Bank Nifty finally settled at 18,555, up 0.2 per cent. Analysts said traders were seen booking profits in some of the PSU lenders, some of which had risen as much as 10 per cent last week on rate cut hopes. Private banks were up in the two-three per cent range during the time. Since a large section of the market did not expect rates to be cut, losses were limited, analysts said. What lent optimism to an otherwise nervous trading session was the RBI statement about possible rate-cuts early next year.
Meanwhile, auto sector stocks saw a sharp negative reaction to the RBI decision to leave rates untouched. The CNX auto index was down 0.9 per cent with Mahindra & Mahindra leading the decline. The stock was down 2.5 per cent at Rs 1,263 a share followed by Tata Motors, down 1.3 per cent and Eicher Motors and Bajaj Auto, down one per cent each.

What exactly does the RBI do for IndiaPrint
Every country has an organisation that works as the central bank. The main function of the central bank is to control and monitor the banking and finance system of a country. In India, The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) serves as the Central Bank.
There are many things for which the RBI is responsible such as controlling inflation, regulating banking system, issuing bank notes, acting as lender to banks, controlling credit, and monetary policy and so on and so forth.
Here are things to know about the functioning of RBI:
1. Control of inflation: Inflation is the supply of excess money relative to the goods and services produced resulting in increased prices. It occurs when the demand increases and there is shortage of supply. RBI controls inflation using monetary policy. It controls borrowing rates for banks by setting the repo rate. When RBI wants to control inflation it increases these rates. As a result, banks and other lenders are required to pay a higher interest rate to the Central Bank in order to obtain money. They pass this on to their customers by charging a higher rate of interest for lending money. This reduces the availability of money in the economy as well as demand and helps in controlling inflation.       
 2. Issuer of Bank Notes: The RBI has the sole right to issue currency notes. At present, notes of Rs 10; Rs 100; Rs 500; and Rs 1,000 are only printed. The printing of Re 1, Rs 2 and Rs 5 has been stopped. However, the RBI has powers to print currency notes of up to Rs 10,000 denomination. But, an amendment to the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 will be needed if any note of higher denomination has to be printed.
3. Banker to Government: As banker to the government the RBI manages the banking needs of the government. It has to maintain and operate the government’s deposit accounts. It collects receipts of funds and makes payments on behalf of the government. It represents the Government of India as the member of the IMF and the World Bank.
4. Payment system: The RBI takes part in the payment system as a user of the system, a service provider and is also the regulator of the systems. As a user it deals with the cheque based clearing operations. It also participates as a user in the Electronic Clearing Service (ECS) and (Electronic Funds Transfer) EFT systems for making its own internal payments to its employees, vendor payments etc. Similarly, RBI transactions in Repo / Reverse Repo under LAF, Open Market Operations, would also be settled through the respective components of payment systems. As a provider it manages the Centralised Funds Management Systems (CFMS), Negotiated Dealing System (NDS) and Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems have been fully developed, operationalised and maintained by RBI. Besides the above, RBI (through IDRBT) has also provided the communication backbone to the financial system in the country in the form of Indian Financial Network (INFINET).
5. Regulates banks: RBI regulates banks in the country. All those aspiring to start a bank or acquire an existing one, have to seek RBI approval. RBI also monitors financial stability of banks and keeps a check on lending in the system. Banks have to maintain a portion of their deposits for cash reserve ratio or CRR and at all times maintain minimum capital adequacy. RBI monitors risks to the financial system by keeping a check on banks.
6. Exchange rate stability: RBI may intervene in the market to influence the exchange rate or to reduce volatility. The basic intention in such actions is to maintain the demand-supply equilibrium. The Central Bank may transact in the market on its own for this purpose or on behalf of the government. Under the Flexible Exchange Rate System currently in operation, the RBI is under no obligation to defend any particular exchange rate but still can intervene to influence the market sentiment.
7. Custodian of Cash Reserves of Commercial Banks: The commercial banks hold deposits in the Reserve Bank and the latter has the custody of the cash reserves of the commercial banks.
8. Custodian of Country’s Foreign Currency Reserves: The Reserve Bank has the custody of the country’s reserves of international currency, and this enables it to deal with crisis connected with adverse balance of payments position.
9. Lender to banks: The commercial banks approach the Reserve Bank in times of emergency to tide over financial difficulties, and the Reserve bank comes to their rescue though it might charge a higher rate of interest.
10. Controller of Credit: Since credit money forms the most important part of supply of money, and since the supply of money has important implications for economic stability, the importance of control of credit becomes obvious. Credit is controlled by the Reserve Bank in accordance with the economic priorities of the government.

Taking Back California s Direct Democracy from Special Interestsreddit
Nicolas Berggruen is the founder of the Berggruen Institute on Governance and chairman of Think Long for California. Darrell Steinberg, D-Sacramento, is the outgoing president pro tempore of the California state senate and author of SB 1253.
SACRAMENTO, Calif -- In the wake of an election where experts projected record-low voter turnout across California, it's no surprise that those same experts are now sifting through the electoral rubble and attempting to identify changes to the system that might reignite voter interest and increase participation.
One common denominator in these aptly named "postmortems" has been a renewed critique of California's initiative system. This year's underwhelming and relatively short ballot featured several high-dollar battles over complex, low-awareness issues, which were more likely to alienate, not attract, voters.
More than 100 years and almost 400 ballot measures after being established, our initiative process remains extremely popular with voters who value having a direct role in the lawmaking process. But, little by little, the initiative process has become a tool for the big money special interests it was intended to circumvent.
As a result, past ballots have been riddled with arcane, single-interest skirmishes supported by expensive professional signature-gathering efforts and misleading advertising campaigns and mailers. Measures have been specifically designed to contradict competing initiatives -- or to mask the purposes and consequences to confuse and mislead voters. Even well-intentioned efforts have been marred by drafting errors, poor legal reasoning and unintended policy outcomes from proposals not vetted or analyzed by experts. Worse, some initiatives have been abandoned by their proposers even after they qualify -- or superseded by newer proposals or compromises that clutter ballots and frustrate voters.
None of this has been lost on the public. According to the Public Policy Institute of California , 8 in 10 California voters have expressed support for changing California's initiative process. A survey conducted this year indicates 83 percent of Californians agree that initiative wording is too complicated and confusing; 84 percent favor increasing public disclosure of funding sources for signature gathering and initiative campaigns; and 77 percent support a review process to help avoid legal problems and drafting errors.
In spite of the widespread support for improvements, the initiative process had been stubbornly resistant to change. Until now. This fall, Gov. Jerry Brown signed Senate Bill 1253 -- the Ballot Initiative Transparency Act -- into law, becoming the first major reform of the century-old direct democratic process.
The new law creates a window for legislative hearings on initiatives to take place months before election day -- offering ample time for legislative analysis, open debate, compromise and collaboration. The new law creates processes for lawmakers and proponents of ballot measures to take comments from the public, and make changes and corrections for errors and unintended consequences that may surface before ballots go to the voters. And the new law gives initiative backers the ability to withdraw a measure after petitions and signatures are submitted if their efforts are no longer viable or relevant or a legislative compromise has been achieved.
Together, these reforms will improve the quality of our initiatives and our direct participation. They create what in political science circles is known as an "indirect initiative effect" -- a role for the legislature to foster public comment and active debate, to highlight errors and unintended consequences and fix them and, perhaps, to craft policy solutions via legislation.
SB 1253 contains other changes intended to improve voter engagement and confidence as well. It extends the time for signature gathering to support grassroots signature collection. It pushes the secretary of state to feature the top funders of proposed initiatives in online ballot materials. And it gives voters a means to opt out of receiving wasteful print materials.
We're still less than a month past the elections, and already talk has turned to the 2016 races and what ballot measures may come before voters. Fortunately, we can look forward to voting on those measures with the prospect that California's cherished right of direct and informed participation will come closer to fulfilling its promise.

GST: FinMin proposes 3-yr compensation for statesGST: FinMin proposes 3-yr compensation for states
Press Trust Of India |  Dec 03, 2014 12:45 AM IST
The finance ministry has proposed to compensate states for three years for losses they may incur on account of switching to a nationwide Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime, as against a demand for a five-year compensation.
"We have tentatively finalised the GST Draft Amendment Bill and have sent it for legislative vetting. The ministry has offered a compensation for three years to states for losses incurred on account of switching to the proposed indirect tax regime," Additional Revenue Secretary Rashmi Verma said.
The states have demanded such compensations be provided by the Centre for a period of five years under the GST regime, for which the government wants to introduce a Bill in the current session of Parliament.

Crocodile rescued in VadodaravillageBy: Express News Service | Vadodara |
Posted: December 3, 2014 4:42 am
A 9.5-foot-long crocodile was rescued from Aniran village near Jarod in Vadodara district after panicked villagers found it slithering on a road in the village.
“It is possible that the crocodile might have migrated all the way from Ajwa lake, which is around 25 kms from the village. Another probability is that it might have come out of the main canal passing along the village and walked all the way inside the village,” said Snehal Bhatt of wildlife NGO, GSPCA.
Ajwa lake is home to hundreds of crocodiles which sometimes come out of their habitat and migrate to far off places in search of food, Bhatt, a wildlife expert said. Naramda canal carries water from Narmada river which also has sizeable population of crocodiles. The reservoir of the Narmada dam at Kevadia in Narmada district is where a majority of crocodiles rescued in Vadodara are released.
“It is hard for crocodiles released into the reservoir to adjust to a new environment and live among other crocodiles. Increasing number also cause food shortage which forces them to migrate,” Bhatt said.
This is one of the largest crocodiles rescued during this season, even as incidents of crocodiles being spotted among human habitat continue to be reported in and around Vadodara. A 15-foot-long crocodile remains the longest for the current season, while total number of crocodiles rescued this season may number over two dozens, wildlife rescuers said.

It could be fall season in MarchIndian rupee slips past psychological $63 mark to hit 13-month low
With the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) signalling a turn in the rate cycle early next year, bankers said on Monday it was possible lending rates could start falling towards the end of the first quarter of 2015.
State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya said the central bank would most probably trim rates after the Union Budget for 2015-16 was announced, possibly by as much a 50 basis points.
“Lending rates should trend down towards the end of the first quarter though there is a feeling that deposit rates also need to come down before that can happen,” Bhattacharya told a television channel, hinting that base rates may not be pruned immediately though spreads could be compressed to give borrowers relief. Indeed, given the surplus liquidity and the lack of takers, loan rates have been coming down, especially at the shorter end, reflected in rates on commercial paper.
Leaving the key repo rate unchanged at 8% after a review of the monetary policy on Tuesday, RBI governor Raghuram Rajan observed at a press conference that in the past, transmission hadn’t always taken place at the desired pace. However, the governor believes that as and when the policy stance changes, banks would drop rates meaningfully.
He pointed out that  interest rates in the system had come off. “Long-term bonds since July have come down by 60-70 basis points while short-term rates have come down because we have managed liquidity. Those are positives for corporate India,” Rajan said. The governor added that rates were high because of the high risk premium that was being demanded of some corporates because of their leverage and their inability or unwillingness to repay loans. “That cost should not be attributed to the RBI,” Rajan asserted.
Economist Rohini Malkani at Citigroup wrote that the central bank’s dovish tone was prompting the bank to maintain its view of cumulative rate cuts of 100bps by FY16, with the first rate cut in the January-March quarter. “That would thus maintain a positive real rate of at least 100bps over target inflation. We expect the 10-year yield to trend towards 7.50-7.75%,” Malkani wrote.
While the stock markets were disappointed there had been no cut in rates — the Sensex lost 116 points — bonds rallied, sending yields to a 16-month low of 7.97%, the first time since June 2013 that the benchmark rate has fallen below the policy rate. Dealers said bond yields are likely to drop by anywhere from 10-20 basis points in the next couple of months and by about 100-150 basis points over the next 12-18 months.
In his review of monetary policy, Rajan observed that while it would be premature to shift the stance at this point, an easing of the policy was likely early next year provided the disinflationary trend continued and the situation on the fiscal front was comfortable, including outside the policy review cycle. “We don’t want to be doing a flip-flop and would like more certainty on the disinflationary process,” Rajan said, adding that the central bank would be satisfied if the government met its fiscal deficit target for 2014-15.
By the RBI’s estimate, retail inflation is now tipped to hit 6% by March 2015 and the central bank believes that risks to this target are “evenly balanced”, as opposed to being on the “upside” in the September policy meeting. The governor mentioned that the proposed new monetary policy framework will soon be finalised in consultation with the government. Rajan said both parties were comfortable with the proposed inflation target of 4%, +/- 2%, beyond January2016.

Farm items in cost-glut pincerGovt considering 6 FDI proposals in single-brand retail
Plentiful supplies globally and elevated costs of domestic production have put India in an unenviable situation, reports Banikinkar Pattanayak in New Delhi. This is because prices of several farm and food items have exceeded their subdued international levels, eroding the country’s competitiveness in the export markets in such items.
Coupled with a broader fall in appetite for raw materials in big consumers like China due to concerns over economic growth, high local prices of select items may drive down India’s farm export growth substantially this fiscal, compared with the average expansion of 21% over five years through 2013-14. Despite sitting on huge stocks due to a fourth straight year of production through 2013-14, the world’s second-largest sugar producer is unable to ship out refined sweetener as domestic prices are over 8% higher than in London, thanks mainly to the high benchmark cane prices set by some states.
Similarly, in raw sugar, exports are unviable without a government subsidy, which is yet to be announced for October, leading to a halt in shipments.
In the case of wheat, high minimum support prices caused the grain’s exports to drop 30% during the April-October period to $705 million. The shipment of other cereals, mainly corn, too, dropped 8% between April and September due to abundant supplies from the US and Latin American nations.
Global soyabean prices are 41% cheaper than in India, dragging down exports of soyameal, used as animal feed. Consequently, overall oilmeal exports plunged 51% in the first half of this fiscal from a year earlier. Although the country imposes a 10% import duty on refined edible oils, the domestic prices of locally-produced soyaoil are 15% higher than global levels. Similarly, tea prices are ruling higher than global levels, resulting in an 8% drop in exports during the April-September period, while export competitiveness in coffee has been significantly reduced now as local robusta prices are higher than in the US.

Nifty seen opening flat; have strong support at 8500Brent
(Pre-market: Nifty seen…)
NEW DELHI: The 50-share Nifty index is expected to open flat on Wednesday following muted trend seen in other Asian markets. The index has strong support at 8500 and below that 8420 level on the Nifty is a trend reversal level.
At 07:30 a.m., Nifty India stock futures in Singapore were trading 0.50 point lower at 8,568 indicating a flat opening on the domestic market.
Nifty ended the day with a loss of 32 points as profit taking dragged it down and it concluded at 8555. The Sensex shed 122 points in value and closed at 28571 on Tuesday.
Nifty now has immediate support placed at 8500 and the index would remain firm as long as 8500 is respected, say experts.
"Positional traders may now trail the stop loss of long positions to 8420 as it has now emerged as a key support for the index," GEPL Capital said in a report.
"If Nifty manages to sustain above 8500 then the recent gains may extend higher and Nifty may test 8710 in coming few sessions. In an alternate scenario if 8420 is breached then that may serve as an indication of short term weakness," added the report.
Overnight, US stocks ended higher with the Dow Jones industrial average closing at a record high. The rally was led by energy shares as US crude fell 2.4 per cent to near a five-year low while Brent lost 2.3 per cent.
The S&P 500 posted 89 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite set 102 new highs and 95 new lows, Reuters reported.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 102.75 points, or 0.58 per cent, to 17,879.55, a record high. The S&P 500 gained 13.11 points, or 0.64 per cent, to 2,066.55 and the Nasdaq Composite added 28.46 points, or 0.6 per cent, to 4,755.81.
Asian shares were trading higher. Japan's Nikkei 225 index which was trading 1 per cent higher at 17,840 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was trading 0.72 per cent higher at 23,824. China's Shanghai index was trading 1.7 per cent higher at 2,812.

Congress questions "culpable silence" of Narendra Modi on Sadhvi s remarksPM Narendra Modi speaks to Nawaz Sharif, says India stands firmly with Pak in fight against terror, offers all support
Congress questioned the “culpable silence” of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the controversial remarks by Union Minister Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti and suspected a political motive behind her utterances ahead of Delhi assembly polls.
“What is Narendra Modi’s stand on this? Why has he not condemned it so far? Before this, Giriraj Singh had also said such things and he was made a minister. Why is he (Modi) quiet? The issue is not only these two.
“The issue is the culpable silence of the Prime Minister within and outside Parliament on it,” party spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi told reporters here.
Wondering whether the Prime Minister has given “direct, indirect, approbation, support and endorsement” to these, Singhvi said “why is Modi running with the hare and hunting with the hound? Why is the monotonous regularity of such remarks before and around elections?”
The tough posture on the issue by Congress came after it was decided in a meeting of party leaders with Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, that the party should go on the offensive on issues like this.
Alleging that Uttar Pradesh was made the first laboratory of such politics in the run up to Lok Sabha polls by BJP, the Congress spokesperson said “has Delhi now also become a similar laboratory? In this context, he also drew attention to the fire in a church in the national capital.
Congress also raised the church burning issue in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.
Asking how can a central minister, appointed just a few days back, have the “temerity and gall” to say such a thing, he said adding a mere apology by her does not erase the “criminal culability” and hinted that some Congress leaders in individual capacity may also file criminal cases against her.
“Anybody can file an FIR and I am sure they will definitely do that,” Singhvi said but made it clear that it may not be by Congress as a party.
Asked whether Congress will resort to disruptions in the House even tomorrow over the issue, Singhvi said decisions are taken on a day-to-day basis but asserted “constructive opposition does not mean sleeping opposition. We will not shy away for a minute from raising our voice on such serious issues”.
Accusing the NDA government of practising “hyopcrisy and double standards”, Singhvi said “these are habitual offenders. We know what Giririaj Singh had said.
“He was rewarded after saying those things and made a Minister of State. Perhaps Modiji will make now make him a Cabinet minister after his second statement.”
Singhvi also targeted Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh’s government over the Maoist violence and took potshots at the central government for its U-turns on issues.
“The law and order in Chhattisgarh is deplorable to describe it in the mildest word. The state government, which is exclusively charged with the responsibility of security, is treating its citizes as canon fodder.
“Human lives from common man, security personnel to politcians, are endangered and more than 1400 security personnel have died between 2005 and 2008 in the state and in 2009 incidents. They are giving lame excuses. Nothing is being done. Empty statements from the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister won’t do. The nation wants to see results,” he said.
Reading a connect in all these incidents, Singhvi said “everywhere there is hypocrisy. They say what they do not mean and mean what they do not say. They cannot be trusted and can do anything to get cheap political gains. They care for cheap political and party interest at the cost of national interest.”
He charged “nobody had thought that we will have to hear such words in Delhi of 2014. Whether it is the issue of Chhattisgarh, remarks of Union Ministers like Jyoti or Singh or what we have said in the booklet, the larger canvass is that they are ready to jetisson national interest for cheap political interest”.

AAP accuses BJP of receiving funds from unknown foreign donorsPM Narendra Modi speaks to Nawaz Sharif, says India stands firmly with Pak in fight against terror, offers all support
Hitting back at Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on the party funding issue, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) alleged that the saffron party received 75 per cent of its funds from unknown sources and also accepted donations from a Goa based businessman, whose name cropped up in a black money case.
“It is a classic case of pot calling the kettle black, in which the party which has three-fourth of its donations from hidden sources is levelling absurd allegations on AAP, which has introduced the concept of transparent political funding in the country,” Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Yogendra Yadav said.
The party is filing a criminal defamation suit against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) , which has alleged that AAP was diverting funds from NGOs of its leaders. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) also alleged that Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has not disclosed the names of its donors.
“Is it not a fact that on March 29 this year, the Delhi High Court found Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) guilty of receiving foreign funds in violation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act? Is it not a fact that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has accepted donations of Rs 1.18 crore from the owner of Goa-based private company, who was recently named by the central government in its list of black money account holders abroad?” he alleged.
The AAP leader also claimed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) accepted donations from another foreign company.
“Is it not a fact that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) received Rs 19,42,50,000 as foreign funds between 2004 and 2012 and can it deny that 75 per cent of its donations come from unknown sources?” Yadav alleged.
He asked Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to prove its “motivated” and “uninformed” allegations and AAP was ready for any probe by any agency in the matter.
Party chief and former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has also challenged BJP to disclose the list of their donors as his party has done and accused the saffron party of “terrorising” those who have donated money to Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).
He also took a jibe at the media for “arbitrary coverage” of the allegations levelled by the ruling party.
“Media has widely covered arbitrary and baseless allegations by BJP against our funding. We are filing criminal defamation against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) .
“I have been challenging Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress to disclose their list of donors (the way we do). Would media give similar coverage to us? For the first time, a political party (is) trying transparent funding n disclosing its list of donors. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) trying to terrorise our donors. Fair?” the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief wrote on micro-blogging website Twitter.
Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had organised lunch for traders, with an entry fee of Rs 20,000. The party collected a whopping sum of Rs 50 lakh.
In a similar event held in Mumbai last Thursday, the party had fetched Rs 91 lakh, taking the total to Rs 1.41 crore in just two such events.

BJP targets TMC: MamataPM Narendra Modi speaks to Nawaz Sharif, says India stands firmly with Pak in fight against terror, offers all support
Two days after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national president Amit Shah launched a vicious attack against the Trinamool Congress in Kolkata, TMC chief Mamata Banerjee hit back, saying the saffron party was targeting her party because it was playing the role of main Opposition in Delhi.
“Today Trinamool Congress is playing the role of main opposition in Delhi. That is why they are targeting us. Those in power in Delhi know Trinamool is their main opponent. But they cannot sweep us away with brooms,” She told a party workers’ meeting here.
The West Bengal chief minister called upon opposition parties to forge unity against the Narendra Modi government which, she alleged, “was trying to sell out the country”.
“They only make grand speeches. There is a limit to fooling people. The Centre is cheating people. They are diluting the 100 day’s rural guarantee scheme,” Banerjee said.
“Soon after coming to power the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) hiked FDI in Railways, Defence. The reduction of prices of fuel in India is not at par with the reduction of prices in global market.”
“They are out to sell out the country,” she said adding, “I heard that the Centre has hiked the excise duty on petrol and diesel again. They deregulated prices of fuel.”
“I urge the opposition parties to unite against this government in Parliament. We will remain behind them. Let the government be strong and the Opposition be strong”, she said.
Banerjee ridiculed Shah’s challenge to uproot the TMC regime, saying a “party which cannot manage Delhi is trying to capture Bengal”.
“Who are they to tell us to go to Bangladesh? What do they know about the history and heritage of Bengal? You manage Delhi first. You eat Delhi’s laddoo first. One who eats Delhi’s ladoo repents and one who does not eat Delhi ladoo repents, she said.
She also targeted Tripura Chief Minister Manik Sarkar for inviting Narendra Modi to address his cabinet colleagues in Agartala, saying, “The CPI(M) has invited BJP to Tripura… CPI(M)-BJP bhai bhai. One is chhota bhai, the other bada bhai”.

The company has fixed price band of Rs 630-645 per share or the issue, which will close on December 5, 2014. Bids can be made for minimum 23 equity shares and in multiple of 23 shares thereafter.
Monte Carlo, the apparel retail chain, aims to garner Rs 342-350 crore through the issue by diluting 25 percent shareholding.
There is no fresh issue of shares. Promoters (including Oswal family & members and other companies) will reduce their stake from 81.06 percent to 63.63 percent and Smara Capital, a Mauritius-based PE firm (through its affilliate, KIL had acquired stake in Monte Carlo in June 2012) will cut its shareholding from 18.51 percent to 10.94 percent through this issue.
The objects of the offer are to achieve the benefits of listing the equity shares on the stock exchanges and the sale of 54.33 lakh equity shares by the selling shareholders.
Monte Carlo allotted 16.29 lakh equity shares at Rs 645 apiece amounting to Rs 105.12 crore to anchor investors namely DB International (Asia), Aditya Birla Private Equity Trust, Tata Mutual Fund and Birla Sun Life.
Brokerages advise subscribing to the issue, citing its strong brand image, strong distribution network, asset light model, healthy balance sheet, positive operating cash flow, widening product portfolio and increasing urbanization.
"With factors such as strong brand value & distribution network, its diversification in non woollen segments and healthy balance sheet along with the recent good performance of share price of other textile companies in the secondary market, we think it may attract investor interest," said Way2wealth.
The company’s net sales have grown at a CAGR of 16.3 percent over FY2012 to FY2014. Although, the EBIDTA margins have declined from 22 percent in FY2012 to 18.7 percent in FY2014, Angel Broking believes they are at sustainable levels. The net profit has grown at a CAGR of 5.8 percent over FY2012-FY2014.
"We recommend subscribe to the issue at the lower end of the price band from a two-year perspective. From a one-year perspective, we see limited upside potential as valuations seem to be fair," says Angel.
Nirmal Bang, which recommends subscribing to the issue for listing gain as well as long term investment, expects the company to continue exhibiting high growth trend until the company reaches a reasonable mature stage of business cycle. Moreover, the high growth in the industry coupled with shift from unorganized to organized player will also fuel and support growth for company, it adds.
As the apparel industry size is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9 percent by 2023, Nirmal Bang expects Monte Carlo to post numbers well ahead of industry growth.
Mehta Equities says considering strong growth in the textile brand segment, Monte Carlo is well placed and connected with customers belonging to both the mass and premium categories.
According to the brokerage, the challenge now is to go pan-India and expand presence across different geographies. Monte Carlo has drawn up an aggressive store roll out plan for the same which will see the company's store count grow to 275 from 192 at present. The company also continues to invest in brands in various formats.
Hence, Mehta Equities expects revenues to grow on the back of a strong brand portfolio and a well established and growing distribution channel. The brokerage recommends investor to subscribe on the issue for listing gains of 15-20 percent.
Monte Carlo in FY14 recorded net profit of Rs 55.3 crore (up 13 percent over FY13) on revenue of Rs 503.7 crore (up 24.7 percent over FY13). ICICIDirect expects the company to report profit of Rs 63.6 crore on revenue of Rs 585.8 crore in FY15.
However, key risks according to the brokerages are fluctuations in the prices of woollen yarn and cotton fabric, seasonality of the business, high proportion of related party transactions, credit risk of franchisees and MBOs, and limited brand recognition in new market.
Launched in 1984 as an exclusive woollen brand by Oswal Woollen Mills, Monte Carlo is one of the leading Indian apparel brands based on revenue. It has been recognized as a ‘Superbrand’ for woollen knitted apparel since September 2004.
It primarily caters to the premium and mid - premium branded apparel segment for men, women and kids, offering a comprehensive line of woollen, cotton and cotton-blended knitted and woven apparel and home furnishings through ‘Monte Carlo Exclusive Brand Outlets’ and MBOs, including a network of national chain stores under the ‘Monte Carlo’ brand.
As on June 30, 2014, there were 196 'Monte Carlo Exclusive Brand Outlets’ in India, two in Dubai and one in Kathmandu, Nepal. It had supplied products to over 1,300 MBOs through commissioned agents.
It has two manufacturing facilities in Ludhiana, Punjab, one for woollen apparel products and one for cotton apparel products. It also recently commenced in-house manufacturing of some of cotton t-shirts and thermals in April 2014.
SBI Capital Markets, Axis Capital, Edelweiss Financial Services and Religare Capital Markets are the book running lead managers to the issue. Link Intime India Private Limited is the registrar to the issue.

Congress says  abki baar U-turn sarkarPrint
Training its guns on the BJP-led NDA government during the ongoing Winter Session of Parliament, the Congress will come out with a booklet to highlight the U-turns taken by the Centre in the past five months.
The booklet, titled “Ab ki baar, U-turn sarkar”, on the key policy issues aims at exposing the Modi government, which came to power in May riding on the promise of radical changes in the way the country was being run. The booklet will be launched on Monday, said Congress communication department chief Ajay Maken.
“Two U-turns put together make up a zero… there are several in this government,” said a senior Congress leader involved in the project.
According to sources, the booklet is likely to expose the government’s stand on key policy issues like enhancing foreign direct investment from 26 to 49 per cent in the insurance sector, introduction of a uniform goods and services tax across the country, the land takeover law, and the food security law.
Congress sources said the BJP blocked the insurance bill and the GST when it was in the Opposition, but is now appealing to the political parties to support it in national interest.
Similarly, they said the BJP supported the previous UPA government’s landmark social welfare laws, such as the land acquisition Act and the food security Act, but is now planning to dilute them.
Sections of the government have argued against changing certain clauses of the land bill, which are proving to be a hindrance in acquisition of land for big industrial projects.
There are concerns over the implementation of the right to food law across the country as it could impact the schemes underway and could limit the government’s plans to reduce the subsidy bill.
Congress sources said they are irked over the government’s plans to limit the national rural job scheme MGNREGS to the poorest 200 districts across the country while trying to project a pro-poor image of Modi.
The booklet will also highlight how the BJP, which opposed the unique identity numbers scheme Aadhar and its use in the direct benefits transfer scheme has suddenly discovered virtue in the ideas.
“They have not done anything new, but are copying our schemes,” said a former Union minister.

LIC keeps powder dry for upcomingdivestmentsDirect equity set to top FDs as biggest asset class in FY15: Report
At a time when benchmark indices are scaling new peaks and foreign institutional investors have maintained their penchant for the Indian market, picking up shares worth $1.9 billion in November, domestic institutional players have once again turned net sellers of Rs 7826 crore ($1.3 billion) worth of equities.
This is the biggest net outflow number for DIIs since March 2014 when they liquidated shares worth R12,520 crore, or $2.1 billion. Market observers say this reversion in DII participation could be on account of a substantial profit booking by Life Insurance Company of India (LIC) ahead of the much-coveted divestment of ONGC and Coal India, among others.
As the Centre rushes to meet at least a part of its R58,425-crore disinvestment target for FY15, the public sector insurance player is expected to actively participate in the stake sale of some of the flagship PSU businesses, including ONGC.
According to the CEO of a domestic broking house, the Street is keenly watching how the government progresses on its FY15 divestment plan. Besides rate cut expectations, developments on the disinvestment front are seen as a key near-term event.
“The question everyone is asking is can the government achieve its divestment target of close to R60,000 crore? Almost $10 billion of paper in the next four months is a huge supply and that is the reason we believe that the LIC has been a net seller in the market, getting ready for the upcoming divestment,” added the CEO.
Various BSE filings show that, in November alone, LIC sold 1 crore shares, or close to 0.42% equity, in Axis Bank in 12 open-market executions at a combined sell value of R469.7 crore.
Industry experts say LIC ought to account for a larger chunk of equity outflow by DIIs in November, given that both private insurance companies as well as domestic mutual funds have not seen a reversal in the net inflow patterns they have observed in the last 4-5 months. While mutual fund participation in the equity market has revived, private insurance players are yet to see a recovery in the demand of unit-linked insurance products. “In general, fund managers are very positive on Indian equities as investor interest has come back. Even if tactically they may have booked profits in November, given the subdued Q2 numbers and higher market valuations, it is less likely that they would have faced redemption pressure in the month,” said an equity fund manager with a foreign mutual fund.
As per Amfi data, net equity inflow for the first 10 months of the year is R39,217 crore, or $6.5 billion, based on the average rupee rate of 60.5 against the dollar.
According to the head of equity investment at a private life insurance player, the industry has not witnessed any unusual redemption pressure in November while inflows have been decent for bank-linked private insurance players. “It is likely that LIC has turned net seller this month ahead of the commencement of the divestment programme,” he added. In late October, FE had learned from a source that after mark-to-market gains of more than 40% from ONGC’s stake sale in FY12, LIC was looking forward to the government’s divestment programme to raise further stake in the oil & gas company if the shares are offered at an attractive price.
Reports suggest that the FY15 divestment programme may start with the stake sale ONGC and CIL hitting the market as early as mid-December after completion of their roadshows. Broader investor concerns of subsidy sharing formula and weak growth in coal productions notwithstanding, a 5% and 10% stake dilution in these PSU giants, respectively, could bring in close to R19,500 crore to the government’s kitty.

I have come to uproot Trinamool from Bengal: Amit ShahPrint
KOLKATA: "I am Amit Shah. I am a small worker of the BJP and I have come to uproot the Trinamool Congress from West Bengal,” thundered party chief Amit Shah as he tore into the home turf of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Sunday.
Virtually kicking off the poll campaign for the 2015 municipal polls and the 2016 Assembly elections at the Uthhan Diwas (Day of Rising) celebration, Shah launched a scathing attack on the state government over the Saradha scam, Burdwan blast and illegal Bangladesh immigrants.
The BJP president’s innovative six-minute break in his speech as soon as “azaan” began earned him plaudits, with Shah remarking: “I don’t want Mamata to get an excuse that I was not considerate for my Muslim brothers.”
Addressing a mammoth rally in front of the iconic Victoria House in downtown Kolkata, Shah said: “If they are defaulters or the CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) is framing false charges against them, the court will take the decision. If Didi is so sure about the role of her party leaders, she must announce that they are honest and have no connection with the Saradha chit fund scam. Can she declare they are innocent? I challenge Mamatadi that you say for once that the persons CBI arrested are innocent.”
“Didi has reduced the platform of our rally. But the huge crowd shows that days are numbered for the Trinamool Congress government in Bengal,” Shah hollered.
The rally was held after a series of hurdles as the city agencies like the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC), state fire brigade and police raised objections, prompting the party to move the Calcutta High Court.
On Friday, the court allowed to hold the rally outside the Victoria House - a place where the Trinamool observes its July 21 Martyrs’ Day rally every year.
Shah said that the Trinamool chief is sending her MPs to protest against the black money issue in Parliament, but here she is saving the Saradha accused who looted over 17 lakh people.
He said: “Why is she not protesting now like Singur? People of Bengal thought that there will be development in Bengal if Trinamool Congress comes to power but after three-and-a-half years, it is the same. No fresh investment has come up so far.”
He also urged people to get ready for the 2015 KMC election for the state’s largest civic body that is currently ruled by the Trinamool Congress.
“Our political journey should begin with the civic body election scheduled next year. And let’s start with the KMC,” he added.
Shah asked the people of Bengal to uproot Trinamool in the next Assembly elections in 2016. He said: “Mamata should answer who bought her paintings? She should answer why Shymal Sen commission was not allowed to work. …She started vote bank politics by protecting the Burdwan blast accused. You (Didi) are objecting to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) probe in the Burdwan blast? Who made you CM of Bengal — the people of Bengal or Bangladeshi infiltrators? She has to answer all these.”
The BJP chief said: “… do not make national borders vulnerable. Even Bangladesh people do not support those who you support. I appeal to the people to add the state to national progress by choosing BJP, which is winning everywhere. BJP should be in power in Bengal too. Make Bengal TMC-free.”

Suspected al Shabaad militants kill 36 workers in a Kenyan quarry - state mediaBy: Reuters | Nairobi |
Posted: December 2, 2014 11:05 am | Updated: December 2, 2014 1:28 pm
Gunmen killed 36 workers in an attack on a quarry in Kenya’s Mandera county, which borders Somalia, Kenyan media reported on Tuesday.
Citizen Television said the 36 workers were killed when suspected al Shabaab militants from Somalia attacked the quarry. The Kenyan Red Cross said the quarry was about 15 km (10 miles) from Mandera town.

2014 winter likely to be less cold than usual: IMDPM Narendra Modi speaks to Nawaz Sharif, says India stands firmly with Pak in fight against terror, offers all support
With temperatures in the months of October and November staying more or less above normal levels, the winter this year in the country may not be a severe one, the MeT department today said.
The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has also recorded this year’s October as being one of the warmest as compared to the normal temperature levels for the month.
“Temperatures have been above normal for October and November. Based on the climatic models, it appears the winter will not be that severe this year as it usually is.
“This year’s October was one of the warmest. The warmest October was in 2010, followed by 2000, then 2005 and now 2014. We are still analysing the figures for November,” said IMD Director BP Yadav.
The mean temperature across almost all weather stations in the country was 0.6 degrees Celsius higher than the normal for October. November, too, was warmer than usual.
But the chill could again be felt from tomorrow as the temperature is expected to drop, Yadav said even as he noted that it would be just a “temporary phase”. He added that regional variations can also affect the temperature.
Minimum and maximum temperatures would fall by 2-3 degrees over the plains of northwest India, Gujarat and north Madhya Pradesh in the coming 48 hours. Shallow fog in the morning would occur at isolated pockets in Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and western UP over the next two days.
In Delhi, the day temperature is going to hover between 28-29 degrees while the minimum may dip to settle in the 9-11 degree-range in the coming week, IMD said.

At least 50 fishermen go missing as South Korean ship sinks in Bering SeaPrint

South Korean officials expressed fear Tuesday, Dec. 2, 2014, of a huge death toll after rescuers failed to find any of the more than 50 fishermen missing after their ship sank amid high waves in the freezing waters of the western Bering Sea on Monday, Dec. 1. (AP Photto/Yonhap)
By: Associated Press | South Korea |
Posted: December 2, 2014 1:52 pm | Updated: December 2, 2014 2:16 pm
South Korean officials expressed fear on December 2, of a huge death toll after rescuers failed to find any of the more than 50 fishermen missing after their ship sank amid high waves in the freezing waters of the western Bering Sea on Monday.
Authorities rescued seven crew members and recovered one body, but weather and water conditions complicated the search for the others, an official from the South Korean fisheries and oceans ministry said on condition of anonymity because of office rules.
The crew included 35 Indonesians, 13 Filipinos, 11 South Koreans and one Russian inspector, the official said. Russian authorities said there were 62 people aboard the ship, which sank in the western part of the Bering Sea, near Russia.
The South Korean ministry official said it’s believed that the ship, which was catching pollock, began to list after stormy weather caused seawater to flood its storage areas. Kim Kang-ho from Sajo Industries, the canned tuna company that owns the ship, said the 2,000-ton vessel was 36 years old.
An official from South Korea’s foreign ministry, who refused to be named citing office rules, said Tuesday morning that the death toll was expected to rise because rescuers failed to find any of the missing passengers. Four fishing ships that were operating nearby continue to search for survivors, but harsh weather conditions have limited their mobility, the official said.
South Korean Prime Minister Chung Hong-won vowed told a Cabinet meeting that the government will work with Russia to speed up the rescue efforts.
Authorities in the Russian port of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky said the rescued fishermen were well and would be taken to South Korea once the weather improves.
“The condition of the fishermen who were rescued is fine,” Artur Rets, chief of the rescue center at the Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky port, told the RIA Novosti news agency.
Kim from Sajo said the ship left for the Bering Sea from Busan, South Korea, on July 10 for the Bering Sea to catch pollock, a winter delicacy in South Korea.
Another official from Sajo, who did not want to be named, said the ship had eight lifeboats and that the seven fishermen who survived and the person later found dead used one of them to continued…

As the government plans to conduct 3G spectrum auction along with 2G radiowaves sale in February, it has asked telecom regulator TRAI to expedite the base price recommendations for it.
"DoT requested TRAI to expedite the process for its recommendations on the reserve price of 2100 Mhz band and related issues so that the auction of spectrum in this band could be conducted along with the auction of spectrum in the 800/900/1800 MHz bands scheduled in February 2015," TRAI said.
In the consultation paper today for valuation and reserve price of spectrum in 2100 MHz band, used for 3G services, the regulator has said that the Department of Telecom is in talks with the Defence Ministry for the vacation of the band and there are three possible scenarios under deliberation.
In case one, if no spectrum is released by the Defence, then auction can't be conducted in this band. The second scenario is that it releases 5 MHz in 17 circles, in that case one block of 5 MHz spectrum will be available for auction in 17 circles.
The third scenario could be the Defence swapping 2100 MHz spectrum with 1900 MHz. In that case, in addition to 5 MHz spectrum in 17 circles, it may release 15 MHz on pan-India basis by swapping 2100 Mhz spectrum with 1900 Mhz.
Telecom companies as well as the regulator have been of the view that the auction should take place only when adequate spectrum is made available, and the bidding should be held simultaneously for both the services - 2G and 3G.

Defence had released 20 MHz out of 25 MHz in 2100 MHz band allocated to DoT under the agreement with Defence on a pan-India basis and one more block of 5 MHz in 5 circles, which was auctioned in 2010.
Under the agreement with DoT, the remaining spectrum is to be vacated only after the alternate communication network is completed.
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India said stakeholders can send their comments regarding 2100 Mhz band auction by December 15 and counter-comments by December 19.
TRAI has earlier reiterated its recommendations for 900 and 1800 Mhz bands while it has increased the base price by 15 percent for 800 MHz band.
The DoT had sent back TRAI's recommendations on 800, 900 and 1800 MHz bands for reconsidering some points.
The next round of spectrum auction is proposed to be held in February and the government is estimated to garner at least Rs 9,355 crore from sale of radiowaves.
As per estimates, auction of spectrum in 2100 Mhz band in February can fetch bids worth at least Rs 5,000 crore.

Morgan Stanley sees Sensex at 32 500 by next DecMorgan Stanley sees Sensex at 32,500 by December 2015
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: December 3, 2014  | 10:30 IST
The bullishness in the Indian stock market is likely to continue and the benchmark Sensex will reach 32,500 by December 2015, Global brokerage firm Morgan Stanley said.
According to the global financial services major, Indian equities are benefiting from the start of a new growth cycle, a benign global environment resulting in a positive shift in terms of trade and reforms, which can lift India's potential growth rate.
"Our December 2015 BSE Sensex target is 32,500," Morgan Stanley said in a research note and added it is overweight on sectors like energy, consumer discretionary, financials and technology.
Stock markets have seen significant gains in 2014 and the Sensex has gained 7,268.23 points, or 34.33 per cent, so far this year.
"Sentiment is strong with support from flows and momentum - our market timing indicator suggests that market mood is buoyant though yet to hit exuberant territory," it said.
The 30-share Sensex was trading 0.41 per cent down at 28,441.16 in the afternoon after the Reserve Bank kept the key interest rates unchanged on Tuesday.
"Our view is that government reforms are on track and if these reforms progress well, we see upside risk to earnings estimates," Morgan Stanley said.
Some key initiatives that have been taken by the Centre include: efforts to make India a better place to do business, tax reforms to kick start growth, fiscal consolidation to stem inflation, realignment of subsidies to make the economy more productive and boost to infra spend to lift growth.
While foreign flows have been strong in the past 12 months, in the coming 12-24 months Indian markets could see sharp rise in domestic flows into equities as explained earlier, the report said.
The report further said equities for now look less appealing against long bonds but the likely rate cuts in future could change that and could feed into equity valuations.

The government in considering a proposal to provide essential drugs free of cost to all patients in a bid to bring down out-of-pocket expenditure of an individual on health care, which is presently a whopping 86 per cent.
"Government is examining a proposal to launch  to provide essential drugs free of cost to all patients visiting public health facilities," Health Minister JP Nadda said, replying to questions in Rajya Sabha.
Quoting a World Health Organization (WHO) report, Nadda said that out-of-pocket spending as part of private expenditure on health care is 86.3 per cent in the country compared to 22 per cent in the US and 57 per cent in the UK.
The reason for high expenses in the country is attributed to low government expenditure on health and the poor having limited access to essential drugs and diagnostics in public health services.
Nadda said the impact of rising health care cost had been drawing the government's attention and it has taken several steps to provide "accessible, affordable and accountable" health care facilities to people.

It s going to be pretty bloody hardTweet

Ryan Harris.Ryan Harris bowled sixty balls at Queensland training on Tuesday. Not a single one was a bouncer.
While this was primarily so he could hone issues of rhythm and technique, Harris' reluctance to send down a short ball spoke much for the changes wrought to cricket by the death of Phillip Hughes. So did the fact that two days out from what would have been day one of the Gabba Test, Harris was at Allan Border Field in his state colours.
Harris, Mitchell Johnson, Peter Siddle and company must wrestle with one of the many awfully mixed emotions arising from Hughes' death. They have been reminded of the destructive power of the bouncer, reeled at this fact, and yet must eventually find a way to harness it again. It will take time.
"It's inevitable it's going to happen - I've been bowling bouncers for a long time and I've hit guys before," Harris said in Brisbane. "It's part of the game but it just gives you that extra bit of doubt now about a very small percentage of what happened. I'm sure we'll get back eventually to the way we were playing last summer, but it's going to be tough because we base our game on aggression."
That question will take longer to answer than a more immediate one, around who will consider themselves fit to play in the first Test in Adelaide from December 9. Harris has experienced this dilemma before, when his mother Gai died of lung cancer in 2006. Even so, he remains unsure of when he will be ready.
"I'm still thinking about it, I'll see how I go tomorrow," Harris said of Hughes' funeral in Macksville. "Every individual is different. Personally I've lost my mother before and the best thing for me was I was probably pushed to play for my father and my brother and it probably helped. But even still, it's going to be tough for some boys. It's going to be tough for me.
"I'm going to have to work it out when we get to Adelaide and see how I feel. I feel good having been out today, which was good. Keeping busy this morning has allowed me not to sit around and think about tomorrow, to be honest. Each individual is different. The boys who were there and witnessed what happened … I can't speak for them because I couldn't imagine what they're going through."
There will be a lot of love, a lot of pain and a lot of shared memory of Hughes at his funeral in on Wednesday. Harris and his Australian team-mates are all making the trip, mainly via an overnight stay in Sydney on Tuesday. Many of their eyes will be on their captain Michael Clarke, who will continue to carry a significant burden of friendship and leadership by speaking during the service.
"We want him playing. He's our captain and our leader and through this whole thing he's shown why he is," Harris said. "He's hurting and he's had a lot to deal with, he's been just unbelievable. We've had some good chats as a group the last few days and he's just been fantastic. So we want him there, but we'll see how it goes.
"We'd have liked a bit longer but that's just reality. There's a Test series on and there's games to be played. That's what we have to do. Those who can prepare will and those who can't will need more time. It's a 50/50 but the bottom line is we've got a date to work to now. The idea was we had a chat yesterday and we just wanted a date to work towards. Some guys can and some guys may not be able to.
"Let's just get past tomorrow first. It's going to be pretty bloody hard. The thing about this is that no-one knows. No-one's been in the situation of losing a teammate and a very good mate and trying to play a cricket game less than a week later. No-one's been in that situation. We'll get through tomorrow, see how we all feel and get to Adelaide and regroup."

With an aim to help public sector banks raise capital, the government is considering to reduce its stake up to 52 per cent in a phased manner in these banks, Finance Minister Arun Jaitely said on Tuesday.
"A proposal for allowing public sector banks (PSBs) to raise capital from public market by diluting Government of India holding up to 52 per cent in phased manner is under consideration," Jaitley said in written reply in the Rajya Sabha.
The reduction of government share in equity capital of PSBs to 52 per cent will enable mobilisation of Rs 89,120 crore approx on the basis of current market price on November 21".
There are about two dozen state-owned banks and government holding in them ranges from 56.26 per cent to 88.63 per cent.
The government has infused around Rs 58,600 crore in these PSU banks since 2011.
PSBs require equity capital of Rs 2.4 lakh crore by 2018 to meet Basel III norms. For the current fiscal, the government has allocated Rs 11,200 crore for bank capitalisation.
As per the existing law, government holding in PSBs cannot fall below 51 per cent.
Replying to another question, Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha said that the total amount of Gross Non Performing Assets (NPAs) stood at over Rs 1.64 lakh crore for nationalised banks and over Rs 2.43 lakh crore for public sector banks in September-end 2014.
Sinha further said amount of top 30 NPAs is Rs 87,368 crore, 35.9 per cent of total Gross NPAs of PSBs.

Debt MFs turn attractive as rate likely early next yearDebt MFs turn attractive as rate likely early next year
BS Reporter | Mumbai Dec 02, 2014 10:50 PM IST
Debt mutual fund schemes are likely to see increased investor interest, with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) hinting at interest rate easing in early 2015. Some fund managers are expecting the returns of equity and debt to even converge over the next six-12-month period. The benchmark 10-year government bond closed at 7.96 per cent, a level last seen in August last year.
Experts say bond yields are expected to continue with their downward trajectory taking comfort from monetary policy statement that “a change in the monetary policy stance is likely early next year”.
Fund managers are advising investors to continue with the existing debt investments. They say increasing the portion of debt component in their portfolio would be prudent, as the equity market returns could taper in 2015 following a sharp 35 per cent gains this year.
Along with capital appreciation, experts say, certain debt schemes could even deliver up to 15 per cent returns. That’s similar to returns expected from benchmark indices in 2015, according to some foreign brokerages.
However, investment advisors are advising not to go overboard with debt investments, as there is little chance of them triumphing over equity in the long run. “Though in the next six-month to one-year horizon, returns from equities and debt may converge. But beyond that equities will overtake,” said Lakshmi Iyer, chief investment officer- debt, Kotak Mutual Fund. “Those who have investments in debt funds should stay put or even make fresh allocations at current levels,” she said.
According to fund managers, fixed-income products with high duration — between three and five years — are poised to benefit the most.
“We continue to run high-duration debt across schemes, and believe that time is right for investors to continue building duration in their portfolios,” said Rahul Goswami, chief investment officer (CIO) - fixed income, ICICI Prudential AMC. “Since over the time the curve is expected to steepen, products like short-term plans and credit funds like corporate bond funds, focused on medium duration, are also very attractive.”
Fund managers said they had already started “adding duration” in the last few months.
According to Vidya Bala, head (mutual fund research) at FundsIndia.com, investors with more than two investment horizons should opt for funds that invest in a mix of government securities and corporate bonds. “While pure gilt holdings could be risky for retail investors, as they require an active profit booking strategy, income/dynamic bond funds, which have upped their portfolio maturity and also hold some good corporate bonds with profitable spreads should deliver adequate returns without too much risk,” she said.
Fund managers say investments made in debt schemes will not keep up pace with what equities are likely to offer in years to come.
The assets under management (AUM) of debt funds, including income, money market and gilt schemes, was close to Rs 8 lakh crore as on October 2014. The total AUM of the domestic mutual fund industry is about Rs 11 lakh crore.
Investment advisors say debt mutual funds will offer steady and risk-free kind of returns to investors in coming years. However, investors with high return expectations will have to opt for equity funds. “From asset allocation perspective, investors can always go ahead for debt products. But if they have high expectations than better to opt for pick equity funds,” said CEO of a large fund house.
According to him, in the last one year, debt products have already returned nearly 10 per cent and over a longer term period could continue to remain in this range.

Samsung exits fibre optics biz to focus on smartphonesSamsung exits fibre optics to focus on reviving smartphone business

Samsung Electronics agreed to sell its fibre optics operations to US specialty glass maker Corning Inc, exiting another non-core business to focus on shoring up underperforming key areas like smartphones.
The terms of the sale, including plants in China and South Korea, weren't disclosed. Announced by both parties on Tuesday, the South Korean firm's second exit from a business line this quarter comes as it braces for its lowest annual profit in three years, squeezed by stiff competition.
Samsung, which was once the world's top maker of smartphones , has been caught between Chinese rivals like Xiaomi at the low end and Apple's iPhones at the top. Samsung Electronics' share of the global smartphone industry has shrunk year-on-year for the last three quarters.
"We have decided to sell our fibre optics business, in order to focus on our core business areas," a Samsung Electronics spokeswoman said. The company declined to comment on how much revenue the division generates.
South Korean Samsung also said in October it will halt its light emitting diode lighting business outside of its home country, which was also considered a non-core business.
Corning, which supplies glass for Samsung and Apple smartphones, said the deal will strengthen its fibre optics business in the Asian market.

Sex discussion among youngsters important: Ranveer SinghBy: Indo-Asian News Service | New Delhi |
Posted: December 2, 2014 5:52 pm
Actor Ranveer Singh, who emerged as a sex icon with his bold condom ad campaign “Do the Rex”, says sex is natural and it’s time to bring it out of the bedroom.
“Sex is a beautiful and perfectly natural phenomenon. Everyone does it and by no means is it a bad or evil thing. So, there’s really no reason to be cagey about it,” he said.
“The facilitation of an open and healthy discussion about sex amongst young people is important to combat the repressed status of sex in India,” Ranveer said in a statement.
The 29-year-old actor feels it’s the ignorance towards the issue that is cropping up problems amongst youngsters and says it’s silly that we still shy away from talking about how we came into existence.
“The attitude towards sex in India is one such matter that needs to be brought to the fore and addressed. The trivialisation of sex in the country is rampant. People discreetly make jokes about it all the time but when the time comes to talk about it openly they don’t. As such, the hypocrisy surrounding sex in India is widespread. For a large section of the people it’s still treated as a taboo subject,” he said.
The actor, who has done bold scenes in movies like “Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ram-Leela” and “Band Baaja Baaraat”, has collaborated with MTV and Durex, a condom selling brand, to create a web show called “Durex MTV Rex Talk” to promote sex-awareness among youngsters.
The show will go live Monday, on the occasion of World AIDS Day.
The actor has also shot a video, released Sunday, with a message ‘Let’s talk about sex’ to promote the message.
Meanwhile, after “Kill/Dil” failure, the actor is looking forward to “Bajirao Mastani”.

Far Cry 4: Another trip into the heart of darknessComments
By Christopher Byrd December 2
Developed by Ubisoft Entertainment, "Far Cry 4" is an action-adventure video game published for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One video game consoles, and Microsoft Windows. (Ubisoft Entertainment)
Far Cry 4
Publisher: Ubisoft
Available on: PC, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One
Like jazz, open-world games promise the bliss of structured randomness. Developers load up games with multiple systems – traffic, pedestrians, wildlife, etc.  – which players probe to create unique moments.  Ubisoft’s Far Cry series marries this open-world game design to a caricature of guerrilla warfare, the improvisational aspect of which fits well with the player’s need to make the best of whatever is in his or her toolset.
As chance would have it, the toolset I had at my disposal the first time I went rhinoceros hunting in “Far Cry 4” was pitifully inadequate. I’m not really much of a hunter, but I needed a couple of rhino skins to craft an upgrade that would allow me to lug around more gear as I explored the fictitious country of Kyrat, situated along the Himalayas. Alas, the rhino in question withstood my volley of bullets and then trampled me without much ado. That put me off tracking them for a while. So you can imagine why one of my favorite extemporaneous acts involved jumping on the back of an elephant and using it to run down rhinos, which accrued me Elephant Kill points.
These types of tasks illustrate the developers’ awareness that open-world games commonly offer a safe venue to conduct sociopathic experiments, hence the strong psychological flavoring one finds in the series. “Far Cry 3” posed the question of where insanity begins. “Far Cry 4” has players questioning what their willful participation in an incubator for sociopathic behavior says about them.
(Courtesy of Ubisoft)
“Far Cry 4” opens with the main character Ajay Ghale, a young American whose parents were natives of Kyrat, traveling by bus to fulfill his expatriate mother’s dying request to take her ashes “to Lakshmana.” As the bus approaches a checkpoint, a bearded stranger advises Ajay to stay quiet and let him do the talking. After the driver of the bus steps outside for questioning, a couple of passengers try to scurry out the back when the patrol opens fire on them. The bus driver then pulls out a gun, and he, too, is shot. Succumbing to panic, the guards open fire on the bus, causing you and your would-be guardian to hit the floor. In the aftermath, the guards instruct you and the other man to lie on the ground, which is when you see a helicopter land in front of you.
Stepping out of the chopper is Pagan Min, the country’s dictator, who punishes the ostensible leader for shooting up the bus by stabbing him to death. Pagan apologizes to Ajay for the mishap.  And before he takes his leave, he notes that he has cleared his calendar so that you and he can go “tear [stuff] up.” This ironic air of self-awareness is typical of the narrative.
(Courtesy of Ubisoft)
By twists of fate, Ajay ends up being “rescued” by Sabal, a member of the Golden Path, an insurgency group Pagan refers to as terrorists.  (I use the scare quotes because although Pagan’s minions are happy to shoot at you, the boss man never lifts a finger against you.) When Sabal takes you back to a Golden Path camp you meet Amita. Amita is not pleased with Sabal, who has jeopardized the group’s members on your behalf.  As you undertake missions for the Golden Path, which you find out was founded by your father, you learn that Amita and Sabal are locked in a power struggle to steer the direction of the group and that their bickering echoes certain aspects of the troubled marriage of your parents.
If you hope to make it through the main storyline you will be forced to side with either Amita, a ruthless pragmatist with a vision for the country’s future, or Sabal, whose adherence to tradition is unaccompanied by a plan for securing Kyrat’s place in an economically cutthroat world. At a few key points in the story, you will also be forced to decide whether or not to kill main characters. These choices determine which of the game’s endings you’ll see. I chose to not kill as many people as possible, but my choices still left me feeling disconcerted. I wondered if my merciful actions might lead to more bloodshed down the line. Such moral dilemmas were high points in the game.
(Courtesy of Ubisoft)
The low points corresponded to technical issues. I resent the fact that you have to sign up for Ubisoft’s Uplay service to access some of the game’s core features like co-op. I also found it annoying that the game doesn’t save at mission checkpoints so if you are logged into Far Cry’s servers and you lose your connection while on a mission, you’ll be forced restart it. But what I found most egregious, especially for a game that spans such a large area, was the paltry amount of audio recorded for radio-bearing vehicles. I can’t be the only one who inwardly cursed Radio Free Kyrat after listening to the same monologue repeated three times in a row while en route to my objective. Then again, maybe those annoyances were purposefully concocted to rouse my inner sociopath.
(Courtesy of Ubisoft)
“Far Cry 4’s” most notable upgrade from its predecessor is that it runs well on consoles. I didn’t notice any of the screen tearing that marred my otherwise enjoyable time with Far Cry 3, which I played on the Xbox 360. In terms of gameplay, little has changed between iterations. But sometimes the same trip is worth taking with different scenery. You heads out there will know what I am talking about.

Hurt and shocked but stronger than ever: Gauahar Khan on slap attackComments
Most of us want reality TV star Gauhar Khan, who was recently slapped by an audience member for wearing a short dress while shooting India's Raw Star, to sdtand strong at the moment. And that is exactly what she is doing. "I thank my family, friends, fans, media, TV industry and film industry for all the love and support. I assure you all that I am hurt but not out. I am shocked but more determined. I felt injured but stronger than ever," the Bigg Boss 7 winner said.
Gauahar Khan
The attack happened on Sunday while Gauhar was hosting the finale of India's Raw Star. An audience member slapped her during the break of the show. He said that being a Muslim woman, the actress should not have worn a short dress. 
Khan expressed hopes that the man, identified as Mohammed Akil Mallick (24) and currently in police custody, will get punished for his violent behaviour. "This loser doesn't represent my beautiful faith which in itself means peace and submission. He apparently attacked me because I am an actress. He wanted to send out his warped message. I am using the same status to appeal to all women to stand against such acts."
Gauhar said despite her shock she did not let the incident spoil the finale of the show and completed her shoot. "I feel that pain of all women who go through any such attacks in the name of moral policing... I know this man does not represent the youth of India because the coward was outnumbered by the young boys who were outraged by his cowardly attack on me," she said.

New Delhi: Union Minister Maneka Gandhi on Tuesday pitched for 33 per cent of police force at every station to be women, saying it would help in sensitising the personnel to handle gender crimes.
Addressing a conference on 'Gender Violence and Access to Justice: Assessment, Analysis and Policy', the Women & Child Development Minister said having 'all women's police stations' would further lead to the problem of segregation.
Gandhi said that she has already written to all state governments about this suggestion. She said women's Helpline cannot be completely effective till there is 'one-stop crises centres' for women victims of violence especially rape.
Gandhi said that she has already written to all state governments about this suggestion.

"Such a solution will be provided at these crises centres which the Ministry proposes to set up and will be manned by nurses, psychologists, social workers, police among others," the Minister said.
Gandhi said training women to be economically independent is a crucial step in ensuring gender equality. She called for setting up Women Training Centers through PPP model and said her Ministry is willing to provide funds for the same.
She also released a book 'Gender Identity and Violence- Female Deselection in India' by Rainuka Dagar on the occasion.

Soon  more leeway for firms to convert loans into equitySoon, more leeway for firms to convert loans into equity
Our Bureau
RBI and SEBI working out what the loan conversion price should be
Mumbai, December 2:  
The RBI will give banks more leeway to convert loans into equity when they restructure loans. In May last year, the central bank had limited the extent of conversion of debt into equity to about 10 per cent of the shares of the company because of some concerns over the prices at which such conversion was happening.
Banks have argued that this (10 per cent cap) also limits the upside they can get if the project turns around and that over the last mile if they can make some concessions on the debt but get substantial equity in return, they could get some possible upside.
“We have looked at this argument a little more sympathetically,” said Governor Raghuram Rajan.
Precisely, how much leeway banks will get to convert loans into equity will be announced shortly by the RBI, he added.
“The key issue is can we agree on a price range that will make the RBI feel comfortable that it is protecting the banks from over paying and at the same time gives SEBI the comfort that it is protecting the minority investors from getting too low a price for the equity that is being transferred. That is where the discussion is,” said the Governor.
Pointing out that this (pricing) was part of the reason that some of the loan conversion into equity was stopped, Rajan said “in the sense that perhaps you could not have full faith that this will not be used to mask bad loans.”
“The counter argument is that if you distrust the banks totally in the restructuring process, then borrowers are not going to get restructuring. Many of these projects (especially infrastructure projects) are in deep trouble and will need new infusions of funds.
“And unless the capital structures are remedied there will be no infusion of funds, which are needed to complete the project. So, how do you get new infusion of funds? You will have to restructure the capital structure somewhat,” explained the Governor.
So, some flexibility has to be allowed with a bunch of safeguards. So, that is what the RBI and SEBI are trying to do.
“The alternative today when you can’t take the equity is to write off the debt and hope that the fellow (borrower) will be nice to you and compensate you later on or that you exercise the right of compensation.
“This way the right of compensation is embedded in the equity. So, if the project succeeds you got a big chunk of equity which comes as upside. So, depending on how you look, this can be seen as a reasonable thing or if you look at it the blackest way possible it can be seen, what you just said, as a backdoor way of essentially writing off bank assets,” said Rajan.
So, the RBI and SEBI are trying to work out what the appropriate loan conversion price should be.
Meanwhile, the RBI also plans to give concessions for restructuring infrastructure and core industry projects under the so-called 5/25 scheme.

In a sign of official patronage to Mumbai attacks mastermind Hafiz Saeed-led JuD, Pakistan government is running two special trains to transport people to Lahore for the terror group’s two-day congregation.
Jamaat-ud-Dawah chief Saeed told reporters on Tuesday that thousands of people would participate in the congregation starting on December 4 at the ground of Minar-i-Pakistan monument.
Pakistan Railways is operating the first train from Tuesday from Hyderabad, Sindh province, that will arrive in Lahore on Wednesday night.
Another train will leave from Karachi and arrive here on December 4. The two special trains will also take the people back to their hometowns on the conclusion of the congregation.
The JuD leadership had spoken to railways minister Saad Rafique for his permission to run special trains for its congregation, official sources told PTI.
Pakistan railways spokesperson Rauf Tahir said there had been a “uniform policy” to run special trains on the request of political and religious parties.
“The Railways has a uniform policy for everyone. Pay and hire a train. Two special trains will be run for JuD congregation but not free of cost,” he said.
In a related development, Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tahreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has also postponed its call to block Lahore on December 4 on the “request” of the JuD leadership.
“Yes, we have changed Lahore’s plan on the request of JuD.  The JuD told us that thousands of people are coming to Lahore on December 4 and it cannot afford any hurdle in it,” a senior PTI leader said on condition of anonymity.
Tightening its noose around Lashkar-e-Taiba, the US in June added its affiliates, including the JuD, to its list of designated terror organisations.
India has maintained that Saeed is the mastermind behind Mumbai terror attacks in 2008, conspiracy for which was hatched, planned and executed out of Pakistan.

Parking problems on the rise  proposals for solutions gatherdustWritten by Khushboo Sandhu | Chandigarh |
Posted: December 3, 2014 4:48 am
Finding a space to park in the city is becoming difficult as the number of vehicles is increasing. Proposals made over the years to ease the situation have remained confined to paper.
In residential areas, big kanal houses have parking spaces, but the same is not true of marla houses. Families on each floor own vehicles and park along the roads. The situation is such that early in the morning and during the evening, vehicles cannot pass in case of emergency.
It other areas, the contractors charge a fee for entering the parking lot. The vehicle owners are on their own after this with no parking attendants for help. As a result, vehicles more than the capacity of the parking lot enter and lead to haphazard slotting.
Ever since the paid parking system was introduced a decade back, the parking fee has remained Rs 5 for four-wheelers and Rs 2 for two wheelers. With the municipal corporation’s revenue from auctions increasing, the margin of contractors is shrinking.
As many as seven of the 23 paid parking lots are without contractors, who say the MC charges them service tax with retrospective effect. Further, they have not been paid fee for city passes that number around 20 lakh. These factors, in fact, have led to the auctions failing twice.
Further, each parking lot is supposed to have a fire zone. But even where these are marked, they are occupied by vehicles. There have been instances when fire tenders could reach a fire only after vehicles were lifted and put aside.
Proposed solutions prove insufficient
The underground parking lots in sectors 17 and 8 are not being utilised because of the lack of lights and security. Also, since parking fee is charged only for surface parking, the contractors do not encourage the use of these parking lots.
A few market welfare associations, which were given charge of the parking lots, have given up. Though a multi-level parking lot is being constructed in Sector 17, those proposed for sectors 43, 34 and 8 are yet to be planned.
Underground parking lots were suggested under every park, but the idea was not found to be feasible.  A community parking lot did come up in Sector 19 on land that was vacant within the residential area, but the same was never replicated in other sectors.
In several other sectors, the width of parks was reduced to provide space for parking. But this was not enough. A proposal was also put forth to create parking space by removing the boundary wall of marla houses, but this too awaits implementation.
Baljinder Singh Bittu, chairman of the Federation of Sectors Welfare Association Chandigarh, said, “People have encroached upon area outside their houses. These need to be removed to make space. Everyone wants to park continued…

Dont change Chandigarh into a trading  industrial city:PatilWritten by Khushboo Sandhu | Chandigarh |
Posted: December 3, 2014 4:53 am | Updated: December 3, 2014 4:54 am
Punjab Governor and UT Administrator Shivraj V Patil, on Tuesday, said that Chandigarh should not be changed into a trading or industrial city. Rather it should remain an administrative city, he said.
As his five year term ends on January 22, Patil told Newsline that those who want to set up an industry should explore options in Panchkula and Mohali or beyond.
“This city has been declared by an administrative city like New Delhi or Washington, or any other city where the emphasis would be on providing facilities for good governance and good administration rather than facilities for trading activities or industrial activities,” he said.
Patil said that “as far as industrial and trading activity is concerned, we are depending on asking Panchkula and Mohali to do something in that aspect and allow this city to provide administrative facilities in the best possible way.”
There is division of work between the three cities, he said while adding that if people have to go 10 kilometres out of the city to get a certificate made that would be a problem for them.
The administrator went on to say that when it was found that there were some industries in New Delhi and old Delhi too, the High Court and Supreme Court directed that these to be shifted outside. This was done to ensure that they do not pollute and to see that the city which has been working to provide administrative and other kinds of facilities for governance are provided freely and in the best possible manner. It is the same principle we have here, he added.
Patil said that the essence of the Master Plan is to see that the character of Chandigarh is not disturbed. “I have approved the Master Plan at my level as per law and sent it to the Government of India for its information and suggestions. We received a letter from them they have no suggestions. The Master Plan will remain in existence for many, many years to come,” he said.
Patil also stated that 90 per cent of the people here want that the character of the city be maintained as it is. It is only 10 per cent who want that they should be allowed to make changes.

NHLs deputy commissioner talks Kings fine  Backstroms appealBy Alex Prewitt December 2 Follow @alex_prewitt
(Geoff Burke/USA TODAY Sports)
NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly and television producer Ross Greenburg addressed Washington Capitals season-ticket holders before Tuesday’s matchup with the Vancouver Canucks, then later spoke with reporters about a handful of topics, ranging from the Winter Classic — the reason they came to Verizon Center — to other issues across the league.
With plenty of Winter Classic coverage coming over the next month leading to the New Years’ Day matchup at Nationals Park against the Chicago Blackhawks, here are some of those miscellaneous, NHL-wide topics Daly addressed:
Fine for Los Angeles Kings ‘spoke for itself’
Earlier Tuesday, the NHL fined the Los Angeles Kings $100,000 for violating the terms of defenseman Slava Voynov’s suspension. Voynov, charged in October with felony domestic violence against his wife, skated that morning beside teammates during what the team called an optional practice, despite everyone reportedly participating.
On Oct. 20, the league suspended Voynov indefinitely, permitting him to “use club facilities and work with team personnel” but prohibiting him from participating “in any team-related functions or activities.” After Voynov skated with teammates, the NHL reacted quickly in handing down punishment.
“I think it spoke for itself,” Daly said. “There were very clear parameters with respect to what was permissible or not under the terms of the suspension, and those parameters were violated today. I did have a discussion, actually multiple discussions with the club. They understand the issue. They have made clear it won’t happen again, and we’ll turn the page and move on.”
“It is incumbent upon us to be more vigilant in managing this situation to ensure that Slava’s allowable training activities always remain separate from the team,” the statement read.
Backstrom’s WADA appeal still ongoing
As the World Anti-Doping Agency disputes the March ruling by the International Olympic Committee to give center Nicklas Backstrom a silver medal, one month after holding him from the Sochi gold medal game for testing positive for a banned substance, Daly and the NHL stood by Backstrom.
“Certainly we support Nick in this circumstance,” Daly said. “I think there were unfair circumstances surrounding the determination, and unfortunately it’s still in litigation. I’m hopeful — can’t say I have any real reason to believe — but I’m hopeful it gets resolved in a way that’s beneficial to Nick, because certainly he deserves his silver medal.”
Backstrom was not allowed to play for Team Sweden because his drug test contained elevated levels of pseudoephedrine from his allergy medication. The substance is not banned by the NHL. Shortly after WADA announced its appeal intentions in mid-November, Backstrom declined comment.
“I don’t really have anything to say about it,” Backstrom said then. “We’ll see what happens. I thought it was over, but I guess not. I don’t really think about it. We’ll see what’s going on.”
No alumni game in Washington D.C.
The usual pre-Winter Classic alumni game will not be held this season at Nationals Park, Daly confirmed to the season-ticket holders.
“That’s a complicated issue,” he said. “There are a lot of issues involved in that. It’s the host team that makes that decision and we try to work with the host team, and we’ve had complications in the past, and I expect that in part was part of the reason here. Another part of the reason could be our venue deal with Nationals Park was fairly late in the game, as I think everybody recognizes.
“In terms of doing all the things we would normally do around this game with the home club, we’re probably a little behind than where we normally are in that case. It’s a great event, but it comes with a lot of issues that need to be resolved too. The primary focus has to be on the Winter Classic itself and the game on the ice, and certainly our priority is to make that as good as it can be.”
Daly declined to tip his hand but did promise the steady release of other events leading up to the outdoor game.
“I can’t make news as I’m sitting here,” he said. “I think you’ll be getting a steady dose of announcements leading up to the Winter Classic in terms of the surrounding events, the things the Capitals and the league are doing together to make it a special event.”

Ahead of hearing  MC acts against illegalhoardingsWritten by Divya Goyal 2 | Ludhiana |
Posted: December 3, 2014 5:47 am
The Municipal Corporation cracked the whip on nearly 400 illegal hoardings in the city on Tuesday,  in accordance with orders of the Punjab and Haryana High Court.
On Tuesday, hoardings were removed from Pakhowal road, Chandigarh road, Hambran road, Mall road and Ferozepur road. While a separate policy for malls, shops and religious hoardings has been drawn up, a policy for hoardings put up by political parties is yet to be finalised.
The high court, on November 21, has asked the MC to prepare a status report and submit it on December 5. It was after this that the civic body initiated action against illegal hoardings and issued a public notice to all shopkeepers and commercial establishments to remove hoardings within two days.
“It is made clear to MC Ludhiana that in case illegal hoardings and outdoor advertisements are not removed by next date of hearing, a court commissioner would be appointed to inspect city and in case the report reveals infractions, the officer(s) would be held responsible,” the court order read.
Talking to Newsline, an official from the MC’s tehbazaari wing said, “The high court has asked for complete report on December 5. It has been the MC’s policy to take action only when HC hearing is near, making the situation tough. But a policy for political hoardings is yet to be finalized as there is a lot of political pressure.”
Sources said that “as per orders of Deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal, not a single hoarding with his photo should be visible in the city. This has further put the MC in a tight spot as local leaders have installed his photos at various spots and are pressurising officials not to act against them.”
Tehbazaari superintendent J S Sekhon told Newsline, “As per bylaws, shopkeepers cannot install a board measuring more than 3 feet in width for advertising. Surrogate advertising is banned and one cannot install boards of any other brand. For malls, building wrap is allowed and for religious ads, 21 sites allowing two boards each are finalized. The MC will submit a status report before the court on December 5.”
Asked about political hoardings, he said, “A policy is yet to be finalised for political ads.”

Flair & Square: Decoding DressCodesWritten by Namrata Zakaria |
Posted: December 3, 2014 6:32 am | Updated: December 3, 2014 11:13 am
Much of Mumbai has its knickers in a twist with the news of a Borivli college imposing dressing diktats on its students. The college forbids shorts, slippers and sleeveless clothing, and also visible piercings and tattoos. The newspaper reports deem it a violation of the students’ freedoms, and those radio jockeys that I’m addicted to for some reason, are the self-styled judge and jury in their mocking tirades.
Uniforms in schools, both private and government, are mandatory in India. They are held up as the greatest social equalisers. With everyone dressed the same, no one is under pressure to impress. Besides, they enhance school pride, and give the young students a sentiment of belonging and a feeling of importance.
School uniforms are welcome and wanted in India. But different countries have varied reactions to them. In the UK, where the idea of school uniforms is said to have begun in the 16th century, the idea seems dated today. Schools that espouse uniforms are usually snobby and upper crust, and champion the idea of militarism. In Australia, each school can set its own uniform policy. In France, school uniforms have not been enforced since 1968.
My school —  an old colonial-style convent run by super-strict nuns who thought that all schoolgirls wanted to do is attract boys — had insane hair rules. If it even skimmed the shoulders it had to be tied up. Pin it if you couldn’t rubberband it. No pony tails if you could braid it. Only black hair accessories. No fringes. Our skirts had to touch our knees. I had my seams ripped open by the headgirl’s finger nails one morning because mine did not.
The newer international schools are even stricter. School buses are mandatory at my son’s school. Mostly because it is a traffic nightmare, but also because they do not like the idea of some kids driving up in Mercedes’ and others in Marutis. I know of a few posh schools that provide same-same school bags, pencil boxes and even stationery for their kids. Parents welcome these as privileges of pricey schools.
But colleges are another story in India. Most of them — even the specialty-training ones — cost very little in fees. Herein lies the biggest problem. The five years of junior and degree college are seen as free and fun time. After the sobriety of schools, colleges are nothing but five years of freedom.
Bunking classes isn’t a big deal (imagine bunking half your school day, or even a class when in school. A letter is sent home or a phone call made). Is this because the children are almost adults? I doubt it. Since a college education costs relatively so little, it isn’t considered that serious.
As soon as one finishes school, the tenth grade in many parts of India, one’s hair is dyed and the style is changed. Spectacles give way to contact lenses, tattoos and piercings come in. This is the age for for trial-and-error with your personal style. Kids wants to be allowed to express continued…

(On the down side, not all…)
Last fiscal, India's overall consumer market growth slipped to its lowest level in a decade, but top global fashion brands Zara, Marks & Spencer, Benetton, Levi's and Tommy Hilfiger all posted anywhere between 14% and 42% year-on-year jump in their revenues, reports ET. And their base is not too low either; except Tommy, all others are Rs 500-crore-plus brands in India.
On the down side, not all of them are making money, partly because they kept their rates affordable and offered discounts to woo Indian consumers despite a falling rupee and rising input costs. Marks & Spencer Reliance India, which operates M&S stores in India, saw its losses soar 400% to Rs 87 crore last fiscal, while Inditex Trent Retail India, which runs Zara brand in the country, reported a one-third fall in its profits.
"We continue to invest into our stores, creating an inspiring shopping environment to showcase our latest international trends at competitive prices for our customers in India," said Venu Nair , managing director at M&S Reliance. Here are the latest numbers available from these global brands in India...

Mumbai: Amid indications that Shiv Sena could join the BJP government in the state, Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee leader Manikrao Thakre on Tuesday said his party would stake claim for the post of Leader of Opposition in the Assembly.
"We are the largest opposition group after Shiv Sena joins the government. Our group leader in the Assembly is Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil. It is up to the high command if the Leader of Opposition post should be given to any other leader or retain Vikhe Patil," the MPCC President said.
He also took a dig at Sena saying that it would be for the first time that the main opposition group in the Assembly would be crossing over to the treasury benches.
Congress said that they are the largest opposition group after Shiv Sena joins the government.

Hong Kong democracy students reject calls toretreatThree students, from right, Joshua Wong, Prince Wong and Isabella Lo speak to the media during their hunger strike at the occupied area outside government headquarters in Hong Kong on Tuesday (Source: AP)

Posted: December 3, 2014 8:49 am
Hong Kong students vowed to stay put at protest sites in key parts of the Asia financial centre on Wednesday in their demand for electoral reforms, defying calls by leaders of the civil disobedience movement Occupy Central for them to retreat.
Hundreds remained at the main protest site of Admiralty, next to government headquarters and the Central business district, determined to continue their fight for free elections for the Chinese-controlled city’s next leader in 2017.
The founders of Occupy Central on Tuesday urged the protesters to go home amid fears of violence, just hours after a student leader had called on supporters to regroup.
“I think that announcement was quite nonsense because as I said, we have been through a lot, and I don’t think that we should pack up our things and leave now,” said 18-year-old student Lorraine Lam.

The protesters are united in their calls for full democracy for the former British colony but are split over tactics, two months after the demonstrations began, in the absence of clear leadership.
The call by Occupy leaders came a day after violent clashes between police and protesters in Admiralty after activists escalated their actions and tried to ring government headquarters.
Police charged the protesters, raining truncheon blows and jets of pava – an “incapacitant spray” – at protesters. Scores of activists and police were wounded.
Occupy leaders Benny Tai, Chan Kin-man and Reverend Chu Yiu-ming plan to surrender to police on Wednesday for their role in gatherings labelled illegal by the government.
Authorities cleared protesters from the working-class district of Mong Kok across the harbour last week, triggering running battles as students tried to regroup.

Shah Rukh Khan  Salman Khan  Aamir Khan on stagetogether!Written by Sonal Gera , Edited by Sarika Sharma | New Delhi |
Posted: December 3, 2014 8:39 am | Updated: December 3, 2014 2:05 pm
The tune of the Khan reunion which started at Salman Khan’s sister Arpita’s wedding seems to have reached its climax on the sets of Rajat Sharma’s show ‘Aap Ki Adalat’. And just like the climax of Hindi movies, this one too had its “happy ending”.
It was the occasion of the completion of 21 years of the show ‘Aap Ki Adalat’ and hence, the shoot of this special episode, which took place last night (December 2) at Pragati Maidan, New Delhi, was attended by the who’s who of the nation including Prime Minister Narendra Modi. But the presence of the three mighty Khans stole the show completely.
We stumbled across these pictures of theirs where they seem to be ease with other. While the Khans appear to be smiling, Rajat Sharma, the host of the show, seems to be attacking them with his questions with his usual sheepish smile.
Seeing the three Khans under one roof and on one stage was a dream of every cinegoer in India and Rajat Sharma managed to accomplish this rarity.
Another picture from the same event was posted on Twitter by the CEO of ColorsTV – Raj Nayak.

10% of IIT grads likely to join startups this year  maximum salary of Rs 24 lakhCodeNation
("Students rate these companies…)
MUMBAI: At least one in every 9 students graduating from the 2015 batch across IITs is likely to join an ecomm firm/startup.
Data collated on Tuesday (day 2 of placement season) from prominent recruiters as well as campus placement cells at many IITs suggests that ecommerce firms/startups will roll out a minimum of 1,000-1,200 offers during the next 3-4 months of placements.
About 9,000 students will graduate out of 16 IITs this year.
Four big players — Flipkart (200-220), Ola-Cabs (200), Snapdeal (100-plus) and Housing.com (100-150) — alone will make around 670 offers at IIT campuses. These four companies hired only 213 grads last year — a 215% increase this year.Acombination of the hectic startup activity — an estimated 800 ventures launched every year — and billions of dollars pumped into consumer Internet ventures from big names like Tiger Global and SoftBank have contributed to this huge surge in hiring.
"Our growth plans are so aggressive that we need top talent to drive growth. Our hiring plans are a function of the pace at which we are growing," said Saurabh Nigam, VP-HR, Snapdeal.
Snapdeal has quadrupled its hiring targets from the IITs this year.
Ola is visiting the IITs at Delhi , Kanpur, Madras and Bombay and plans a 10-fold hiring increase from year last. "We are expanding aggressively into newer cities and going deeper in cities we are already present.
Continuous influx of great talent can help us grow faster and smarter," Anand Subramanian, director - marketing communication, said.
Several other startups, including CodeNation , TaxiForSure , Indus Insights, LimeRoad, Knowlarity Communications, Fuzzy Logix, Vizury and BrowserStack among others, are planning to hire anywhere between 10 and 50 students each across IITs. "Students are excited by these companies, for their work culture, the independence and even the compensation structure," says Parth Vaswani, overall placement coordinator, IITKanpur.
"For many, they probably rank right behind the software sector in terms of the pecking order," he says.
Several of these companies also recruit for IT-software roles.
Vaswani expects at least 150 such offers this year compared to 60-odd last year.
At IIT-Bombay, around 60-70 companies -- almost 20% of the total that have signed up so far --fall in the ecommerce/startup bracket.
Students rate these companies highly, which is why several of them get slotted in the first few days of campus placement, Mohak Mehta, BTech student representative for IIT-Bombay said.
Across IITs, these ecommerce/startup companies are hiring across a variety of roles for salaries that range between Rs 10-18 lakh, going up to a maximum of Rs 24 lakh from the likes of Code-Nation.

Forget MFIs  banks also charge the poor high...Forget microfinance institutions, banks also charge the poor high interest rates
Atmadip Ray, ET Bureau Dec 3, 2014, 04.00AM IST

(This is the trend that has…)
KOLKATA: When it comes to lending to the poor, it's not just the micro finance institutions (MFIs) that charge high interest rates, but also bulge-bracket banks such as Axis Bank and YES Bank, which charge as much as 22-26% a year.
This is the trend that has emerged after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) allowed banks to engage microfinance institutions (MFIs) as business correspondents in June this year. Banks have access to lowcost deposits, unlike MFIs, giving them access to lower cost of funds, but that does not translate into lower lending rates. In reality, private banks charge as much as micro lenders such as Bandhan Financial Services or SKS Microfinance do.
"As the first set of entrants, banks are making the most of it before other creditors get comfortable with the model and start providing funds with lower rates," said Ananda Bhowmik , senior director at India Ratings.
RBI has said even though interest rates have been deregulated, charging interest beyond a certain level is considered usurious and isn't sustainable or doesn't conform to normal banking practices. The central bank remained silent on what could be the "certain level" for banks while it has put a ceiling on MFIs' lending rate, which ranges between 26% and 27% a year.
Banks charging high rates defend themselves, saying the initiative to reach out to the bottom of the pyramid comes at a high cost. One of the most valued banks in India, HDFC Bank, which has a designated workforce to lend to the poor, charges around 22-24% a year, people in the know said. While others such as Axis Bank, IndusInd Bank, Ratnakar Bank, YES Bank that are exploring MFIs as business correspondents or partners to improve their respective rural lending portfolios and meet priority sector targets, are charging as high as 22-26% as well, four persons familiar with the matter said. Even the state-owned IDBI Bank is hiring MFIs to bridge the last-mile gap.
"The rates being charged for micro-lending by banks are driven by the market. Any bank worth its salt cannot afford to be out of sync with competition. This will lead to adverse selection," said Robin Roy, associate director of PwC India. Roy argued that private banks' cost of operations is high as they don't have direct presence in many remote locations.
"Banks are still not recovering their cost of capital," he added. "Most private banks that engage MFIs are charging 22-26% on micro loans to poor borrowers though we have access to low-cost deposits.
This is an industry phenomenon," a senior official with a private bank said, requesting anonymity. "The risk factor attached with lending to the poor is factored in the pricing."
However, three senior officials in the MFI sector who confirmed the trend said banks have used a risk protection mechanism called 'first loss deficit guarantee'. This makes banks' lending to the poor using MFI infrastructure virtually risk-free since up to 5% of the risk is being passed on to the MFIs concerned.
In general, micro lenders enjoy low default at around 1% of their outstanding loans as they have successfully built a model with regular door-to-door interface. Banks give 10% of the loan to MFIs as fee.
Most banks refrained from responding to ET's mail on high rates while an YES Bank spokesperson said: "We would like to deny the same as this is completely incorrect, baseless and out of context."
"We lend to the under-privileged by reaching out directly to women self-help groups and MFIs. We provide loans to these segments at sub-15% rates," an ICICI Bank spokesperson said.
India Ratings' Bhowmik does not expect private banks to reduce lending rates on their own. "MFIs are important intermediaries and have their own set of borrowers.
So, until MFIs' own cost of borrowing reduces on a sustainable basis and they start providing loans at lower rates, these banks are not going to reduce rates," he said.

Live: Funeral ceremony for Phillip Hughes under way at MacksvilleFinal farewell to Phillip Hughes, Clarke pays poignant tribute
AFP
print
Cricketing greats bid an emotional farewell to Phillip Hughes at a funeral service in his home town Wednesday, as Australia stopped to remember the batsman whose death from a freak injury sent shockwaves through the sport.
A lone cricket bat rested against the coffin at a packed service in his former high school hall in Macksville on the New South Wales coast in front of his heartbroken parents, family and friends and a shattered Australian Test team.
"Taken from the game, his family and loved ones at the age of just 25, left a mark on our game that needs no embellishment," tearful captain Michael Clarke told the funeral. "I don't know about you but I keep looking for him."
Hughes, who had played 26 Tests and was on the cusp of a recall, died from bleeding on the brain last Thursday after being hit on the base of the skull by a rising ball at the Sydney Cricket Ground during a domestic match.
His tragic death stunned Australia, where cricket is considered the national game, and prompted a rescheduling of the upcoming India Test series, while fans around the world placed bats outside their front doors as a mark of respect.
Clarke said he walked to the middle of the SCG on Thursday night: "Those same blades of grass beneath my feet where he and I and so many of his mates here today have built partnerships, taken chances and lived out the dreams we painted in our heads as boys.
"I stood there at the wicket, I knelt down and touched the grass, I swear he was with me... Telling me we just needed to dig in and get through to tea," he added.
 
'We must play on'
 
Clarke said the tributes offered from sports stars and fans across the globe had sustained him, from a little girl holding a candle in tribute, to masters of the game such as Sachin Tendulkar expressing sorrow.
"This is what makes our game the greatest game in the world. We must dig in and get through to tea. And we must play on," he added.
"So rest in peace my little brother. I will see you out in the middle."
In Hughes' small hometown of Macksville, on Australia's east coast, tributes to the opening batsman hung in shop windows, while ribbons in the green and gold colours of the Australian Test team adorned telephone poles.
Macksville itself, with a population of just 2,500, welcomed greats such as Shane Warne, Brian Lara, Glenn McGrath, Virat Kohli and Hughes' first Test skipper Ricky Ponting.
Sean Abbott, the young man who bowled the fast ball which struck Hughes, also attended supported by his parents, as did Prime Minister Tony Abbott.
Tony Abbott said there had been profound grief, in part because to "be felled by a hard but fair ball in the centre of the SCG at your most exuberant, it just doesn't seem right or natural".
 
'Spirit of cricket'
Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland said over the past week the nation and the sporting world had reeled in shock.
"Yet even within that profound sense of loss the spirit of cricket has shone through the darkness," he told the gathering.
Hughes' parents Greg and Virginia and siblings invited the whole town to the service at Macksville High School, where about 1,000 crammed into the hall and hundreds more watched on screens in overflow areas.
The funeral was a huge event in Macksville, with shops closing and residents in mourning. Just outside town, one business created a huge tribute using three cherry pickers as cricket stumps and putting Hughes' Test number 408 across them.
At Hughes's old primary school, St Patrick's, dozens of bats lined the front fence, many bearing messages remembering the hugely popular opener who was not out on 63 when he was struck.
As a summer storm threatened after a hot day, hundreds walked along the street behind the hearse carrying Hughes's coffin, some nodding their heads, others applauding, out of respect for the cricketer.
Hughes died after his vertebral artery split when hit by the ball, leading to massive bleeding in his brain.

Tripura CM criticises Modi government for failing to adopt pro-people policies12

Agartala: A day after interacting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit to Tripura, Chief Minister Manik Sarkar called for a movement to press the NDA government for changing its outlook so that marginalised people could be benefitted.
Inaugurating a scheme of transfer of cash subsidy into bank account of consumers for purchasing mustard oil and pulses under Public Distribution System network here, Sarkar criticised the Centre for "not taking pro-people policy".
A movement was needed to press the NDA government at the Centre to change its outlook towards national policy so that marginalised people could be benefitted, Sarkar, also a politburo member of the CPI(M), said.
The scheme will be implemented in a quarterly basis where a beneficiary would receive Rs 105 in every three months.
#tripura #manik sarkar #nda #narendra modi
"The NDA government failed to keep its promise of adopting pro-people policy after coming to power. The BJP government did not attempt to curb the price hike of essential commodities. It rather took decisions for the sake of the capitalists in the country and abroad," Sarkar said.
In a rare meeting between the political right and the left, Modi interacted with Tripura's Marxist cabinet here at Sarkar's invitation and hailed the state's successful strategy in curbing the three-decade-old insurgency.
The Left Front government would try to provide subsidy to a few more essential commodities in future if adequate funds could be arranged, Sarkar said.
Minister for Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs, Bhanulal Saha said 65 per cent of beneficiaries have applied for the new scheme so far.
"As the state government cannot control price hike directly, the scheme is there to help the marginalised people to buy required food commodities," Saha said.
People under the PDS would be given cash subsidy of Rs 35 into their bank accounts in lieu of supply of one litre of mustard oil and two kg of pulses every month, he added.
The scheme will be implemented in a quarterly basis where a beneficiary would receive Rs 105 in every three months.

Ranbaxy in talks with CCI on  specific productsRanbaxy in talks with Competition Commission of India on 'specific products' for Sun deal

(CCI has suggested Sun Pharma and Ranbaxy to…)
NEW DELHI: Awaiting a long-pending approval for its merger with Sun Pharmaceutical, drug maker Ranbaxy today said it is in talks with fair trade watchdog CCI with regard to "certain products".
"We are in communication with the Competition Commission of India (CCI) on specific products and as of now have not received any final order from the CCI regarding divestment of the products," Ranbaxy Laboratories said.
The statement was made in reply to a clarification sought by the National Stock Exchange (NSE) from the company on reports that CCI wants changes to its deal with Sun Pharmaceutical.
The $4-billion deal, which CCI has prima-facie found to be in violation of competition norms, was inked in April this year.
Competition Commission of India (CCI) has suggested Sun Pharma and Ranbaxy to make certain changes in their proposed merger deal , including possible divestment of some brands, to address anti-competitive concerns.
Sources had said the regulator is now awaiting response from the parties on the suggested changes.
Among others, CCI is believed to have suggested divestment of some brands in order to comply with competition norms, sources had said.
Sun Pharma-Ranbaxy transaction, which would create the country's largest pharmaceutical company, had come under close scrutiny of CCI after it was found prima-facie that the "combination is likely to have an appreciable adverse effect on competition".
The combined entity would have operations in 65 countries, 47 manufacturing facilities across 5 continents, and a significant platform of speciality and generic products marketed globally. The deal is also the first one where the commission sought public comments.
Major issues examined by CCI on the deal are with respect to the molecules market.
On Monday, Sun Pharmaceutical said that CCI has been seeking additional information and detailed clarifications with respect to specific aspects of the products for the purpose of making its assessment.
"We see the process nearing its logical closure. We are happy with the open and transparent manner in which the matter has progressed. It is our intent to fully comply with all the regulatory requirements as required to close the transaction," Sun Pharma had said in a statement.

The government may not be able to table amendments to the Land Acquisition Act in winter session of the Parliament, as it needs more time to get opposition on board as well as to build consensus on simplifying the Act.
Sources suggest CNBC-TV18 that the market was expecting the government to pass the Act in the winter session of the Parliament. Earlier, it had also stated that it would not touch the compensation part of the Act.
However, the government now wants to simplify land acquisition rules for private public partnership (PPP) projects, making it simpler to acquire the land and therefore, needing more time to finalise the entire matter, given the sensitivity of the issue.
The constitutional amendment to facilitate the goods & services tax (GST), Land Acquisition Act will be amongst several crucial bills to bolster the Centre's economic reforms memo.
Market experts now anticipate the Act to be taken up in the Budget session.

China loses ground in corruption index  despite anti-graft campaignBy Simon Denyer December 2 Follow @simondenyer
A high-profile anti-corruption campaign launched last year by Chinese President Xi Jinping seems to be very popular with the general public. Unfortunately it doesn’t appear to be working very well -- at least in the view of experts around the world.
The global anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International (TI), in its latest Corruption Perceptions Index found that China had tumbled farther down the list since last year's report than any other country, dropping 20 places. It now occupies 100th place on the list, out of 175 countries surveyed.
TI’s rankings measure perceptions of corruption in each country’s public sector from a variety of different sources. China this year scored 36 points on a scale where 100 equals total purity. That means it is perceived as slightly more corrupt than places like Colombia, Egypt and Liberia. By contrast, this year’s least corrupt country, Denmark, scored 92. The most corrupt were North Korea and Somalia, which each scored 8.
In China, Xi has vowed to catch both the tigers and the flies – the high-level and low-level officials – responsible for graft, and there have already been several high-profile defendants. The campaign rarely leaves the news, and undoubtedly has had an effect on how brazen officials are about flaunting and spending their ill-gotten gains, with a well-documented decline in demand for luxury goods in China.
This week, the former Portuguese colony of Macau, the only part of China where gambling is legal, reported the  first contraction in its economy for five years in the third quarter of 2014. The reason, apparently, was a big drop in revenues at casinos, partly linked to China’s economic slowdown but also blamed on the campaign to eradicate graft.
At the same time, China Daily newspaper reported a drop in the number of people taking a highly competitive exam to join the civil service. The paper said the decline was connected to the anti-corruption campaign that had dampened the attractiveness of a job in the public sector for some students.
So why is China not doing better on TI’s index?
One possible reason, according to TI’s Rukshana Nanayakkara, is that China has embarked on a top-down campaign that is focused more on punishing people rather than systemic fixes. Punishment can create a short-term deterrent effect, and is good public relations for the president, but it may be less effective if the victims are perceived as having been selected for more for political than legal reasons – the investigation into former security chief Zhou Yongkang is a good example.
And it won’t have as much effect as a multi-faceted campaign that involves civil society , is built on an independent investigative agency and judicial authority, and reduces incentives for public sector graft. “If you want to fight corruption, it has to come from the bottom, from the grassroots – rather than just punishing people,” Nanayakkara says.
Civil society activists in China who have demanded that officials declare their assets have been locked up for their troubles, while public servants enjoy enormous power thanks to multiple layers of red tape, but earn poor salaries – the perfect ingredients for bribery to thrive. Under Chinese law, Nanayakkara adds, a bribe is also not criminalized if it falls below the equivalent of $820 for an individual or $32,700 for a company.
A recent report on state news agency Xinhua that presented corruption in China as a systemic problem was subsequently deleted, the South China Morning Post reported this week -- apparently  because it contradicted the party line that ascribes it not to the system but to individual moral weaknesses.
But it might be too early to write China’s anti-corruption campaign off completely. TI’s rankings draw on data from 12 different sources, including the World Bank, Freedom House and the World Economic Forum’s Executive Opinion Survey, compiled in 2013 and 2014. It is possible that China’s rating will improve again next year as the campaign shows up in some of the source surveys, and as the campaign bites more deeply into official behavior. But it may not be the success the Communist Party would claim it to be.
Simon Denyer is The Post’s bureau chief in China. He served previously as bureau chief in India and as a Reuters bureau chief in Washington, India and Pakistan.

Why is the RBI playing it safeHi Guest
Why is the RBI playing it safe?
A rate cut by RBI would have been a largely signalling act, which was of little value in today’s circumstances. As widely expected, even though it wasn’t what many had hoped for, the Reserve Bank of India on Tuesday maintained the status quo on the repo rate in its fifth bi-monthly policy review statement of the current year. Business Standard had endorsed this position and must, therefore, commend Governor Raghuram Rajan for sticking to his stance in the face of enormous pressure ...

Sudarshan Sukhani of s2analytics.com told CNBC-TV18, " Zee Entertainment has been in a strong and consistent uptrend in a small trading range and a very narrow range for the last three days. That narrow range should break on the upside simply because the trend is very visibly and clearly up."
"So buy Zee, put a stoploss in the unlikely event that it doesn’t break out or it fizzles out, it has become a heavyweight. The stock had gone down so much, now it is one of the outperformers," he said.

Furious backlash over Facebook rant against Barack Obama daughtersSteep rate hike in Russia fails to stem rouble rout
A US lawmaker’s communications director was facing social media calls that she be sacked after her Facebook rant about President Barack Obama’s daughters prompted widespread anger.
Elizabeth Lauten, spokeswoman for Republican Congressman Stephen Fincher of Tennessee, wrote a scathing post to her Facebook account scolding Malia and Sasha Obama, 16 and 13, for looking bored while attending a public event with their father on Wednesday.
In the post, since deleted but widely reproduced in screen grabs, Lauten tells the girls to “try showing a little class. At least respect the part you play.”
The girls stood beside Obama — looking vaguely bored — as he issued the annual Thanksgiving turkey “pardon,” saving two birds from the dinner table.
The underwhelmed expressions of the teenaged sisters sparked mainly amused comment, but Lauten’s remarks were notably more caustic.
“Then again, your mother and father don’t respect their positions very much, or the nation for that matter,” Lauten wrote in her post.
“So I’m guessing you’re coming up a little short in the ‘good role model’ department.
“Nevertheless, stretch yourself. Rise to the occasion. Act like being in the White House matters to you.
“Dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar,” she added, apparently referring to the girls’ short skirts.
The post quickly drew ire on Twitter and elsewhere, with many calling for Lauten to be fired, even after Lauten deleted it and posted an apology.
“After many hours of prayer, talking to my parents, and re-reading my words online I can see more clearly just how hurtful my words were,” Lauten wrote on Facebook, also widely reproduced before she made her page private.
“I’d like to apologise to all of those who I have hurt and offended with my words, and I pledge to learn and grow (and I assure you I have) from this experience,” she added.
Star Jones, a lawyer and television personality, was among those unimpressed. “I’ve seen tacky people…but rarely seen someone as tacky as #ElizabethLauten for slamming the children of the #POTUS,” she tweeted.

Many directed their tweets to Lauten’s boss, as the hashtag #FireElizabethLauten went viral.
One commenter, whose username is Eclectic John, wrote: ” @RepFincherTN08 There is nothing that excuses what # ElizabethLauten posted re the children of our President. That’s off limits. Fire her now.”

Rohtak sisters beat up molesters in public busRohtak sisters beat up three men who tried to molest them on a public bus
Mail Today –  Mon 1 Dec, 2014
Rohtak :Two college-aged sisters were forced to fight back with a belt after three men harassed them on board a Haryana Roadways bus, while their fellow passengers watched.
The men threw the girls out of the bus, but were later arrested over the incident.
"After our investigation concluded, we arrested three of the accused who will be produced before the court tomorrow," said SHO of Rohtak police station Gajendra Singh.
The episode occurred on Friday when Pooja and Aarti of Thana village - two BSc final year students of Rohtak Government College - were returning home.
The youths, from Rohtak’s Asan village, started making lewd gestures and hurling indecent language.
"One of the goons wrote his phone number on a paper and threw it at us. We told him not to do so. He said they will have to pick it up and accept him."
"The goons followed when the girls even changed their bus. They continued to tease despite a woman passenger objecting."
When the trio crossed all limits, one girl asked them to stop, prompting a goon to push and grab her neck. After noticing that the eve-teaser was pressing her sister’s throat, Pooja removed her belt and became a real “Mardaani”, kicking, punching and beating him up.
The victims said that the goons started hitting them when the bus stopped. However, after being thrown out, one sister threw a brick that hit one of the men as he fled the scene.
Shockingly, the bus crew did not stop the vehicle or help the girls who were thrown out of the vehicle. The driver continued to drive even when the goons were harassing and thrashing the girls. Moreover, the other passengers also remained mute spectators.
The victims even dialled the number of the women’s helpline, but got no response.
One passenger recorded the girls’ fight back on her mobile. After reaching home, the sisters narrated the incident to their parents and subsequently a case was registered at the Rohtak Sadar police station.
The BJP, in its election campaigns, had promised to bring down crimes against women and Dalits but the situation remains the same.
Haryana Women's Commission vice-chairperson Suman Dahiya said: “I will personally visit the place where the incident took place.”

Crude oil prices could drip below $40 a barrel

CARACAS
(Oil has dropped 38% this…)
LONDON|PARIS: Oil's decline is proving to be the worst since the collapse of the financial system in 2008 and threatening to have the same global impact of falling prices three decades ago that led to the Mexican debt crisis and the end of the Soviet Union .
Russia , the world's largest producer, can no longer rely on the same oil revenues to rescue an economy suffering from European and US sanctions. Iran , also reeling from similar sanctions, will need to reduce subsidies that have partly insulated its growing population.
Nigeria, fighting an Islamic insurgency, and Venezuela, crippled by failing political and economic policies, also rank among the biggest losers from the decision by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries last week to let the force of the market determine what some experts say will be the first free-fall in decades.
"This is a big shock in Caracas , it's a shock in Tehran , it's a shock in Abuja," Daniel Yergin , vicechairman of Englewood, Colorado-based consultant IHS and author of a Pulitzer Prize-winning
history of oil, told Bloomberg Radio. "There's a change in psychology. There's going to be a higher degree of uncertainty."
Oil has dropped 38% this year and, in theory, production can continue to flow until prices fall below the day-to-day costs at existing wells. Stevens said some US shale producers may break even at $40 a barrel or less.
The International Energy Agency estimates most drilling in the Bakken formation -- the shale producers that Opec seeks to drive out of business -- return cash at $42 a barrel. A world already unsettled by Russian-inspired insurrection in Ukraine to the onslaught of Islamic State in the Middle East is about be roiled further as crude prices plunge. Global energy markets have been upended by an unprecedented North American oil boom brought on by hydraulic fracturing, the process of blasting shale rocks to release oil and gas.
Few expected the extent or speed of the US oil resurgence. As wildcatters unlocked new energy supplies, some oil exporters abroad failed to invest in diversifying their economies. Coddled by years of $100 crude, governments instead spent that windfall subsidising everything from 5 cents-pergallon gasoline to cheap housing that kept a growing population of underemployed citizens content.

Weak capex to delay biz recovery for Siemens:KotakDirect equity set to top FDs as biggest asset class in FY15: Report
Siemens is well-placed to capture the recovery in capex cycle based on (1) alignment of its business interests with the Prime Minister’s growth vision and (2) higher localisation-led improvement in competitive positioning. Broad-based weakness in capex, though, is reflecting its expectations of at least a year’s wait for business recovery. Its margin has benefitted from internal cost improvements; incremental upside would depend on volumes. For 25x exit multiple two years from now, the stock needs to deliver R41 EPS in September 2017e to cover 14% cost of equity. We revise target price to R 600 from R550.
Siemens, in its analyst meet, mentioned broad-based weakness in capex. They expect a year’s wait before business starts turning around. The lack of overall demand is possibly leading to Siemens not planning any major capex despite operating at good utilisation levels.
Siemens hinted at execution headwinds in FY2015 based on impending closure of large projects in energy and infrastructure segments and larger share of projects versus products in backlog. On margins, it has benefitted from internal improvements although it believes that any incremental upside will come only from demand-led volume improvement.

Hard Look: Shelter-SkelterWritten by Shalini Narayan , Mayura Janwalkar , Naveed Iqbal | New Delhi |
Posted: December 2, 2014 3:12 am
It’s that cold time of the year again. At below 10° C, debates simmer on whether homeless people are smelly statistics or a stiff housing problem. But for those curling under their tight tents, a shelter space provided is a life potentially saved.
Deep suspense over puris and sabzi
By Shalini Narayan
It’s 9.30 pm on a Friday and 38-year-old Dinesh has been standing by the roadside, eagerly awaiting the arrival of the white van that brings puri and aloo ki sabzi. With him stand a hundred others, tired after the day’s scavenging. Some earned their bit for the day, others went pennyless. Food was their only chance left in the day. But after two hours of waiting by the footpath, there is still no sign of puris or sabzi. The food may not come tonight.
This is just another day’s suspense at the Yamuna Pushta night shelter in Central Delhi.
Dinesh has been visiting the shelter for three years. He knows the bedtime drill. By the time he arrives, a long queue is already waiting outside the seven tents and porta cabins. Entry is on a first-come-first-served basis. One by one, men are allowed inside, handed over blankets and given a space just enough to allow them to sleep straight. Desperate as they are to have a roof over their heads, occasional fights erupt. Sometimes, police have to come and drive away a few cranky ones. But Dinesh always stays outside. “I never go in. They carry diseases. Most of them are alcoholics and haven’t bathed in months. I will fall sick if I go in there,” he says. Dinesh manages a blanket for himself and settles on a patch of grass just outside the tent.
A native of Rajasthan, Dinesh arrived in the city 10 years ago and worked as an auto-rickshaw driver. Most of his earnings went as rent, leaving him just enough to barely make ends meet. Soon, he fell ill. Unable to report to work everyday, he lost his job. He now begs for a living.
“The first few times I came here, I slept inside the tent. But at night, someone would either trample over my foot or create a ruckus. It’s hell inside there. The drunkards come and vomit all over the place. If we ask them to go out, they pull out knives threatening to attack us. So I sleep outside,” he says.
The shelters have no eating facility. The only source of food is when volunteers pay a visit. If food is erratic, water is a bigger problem.
The Yamuna Pushta night shelter is run by Child Watch India and came up about eight years ago. A tent is the newest shelter added to the existing six. Each night shelter has room for 40. There is one toilet located behind the shelter. But few like using it. Located in an area where the lighting is poor, the area is prone to attacks and thefts.
Rajesh Kumar, the caretaker of the shelter, says, “Most of the visitors here are from UP and Bihar. The place is closed for an hour in the morning and the evening for cleaning. We open at 5 pm and people are asked to leave by 8 am the next day. On Sundays, we allow them to sleep longer, till about 9 pm. We accept all, from beggars to drug-addicts to a daily-wage worker.”
Sunil Kumar Aledia, member, Centre for Holistic Development, an organisation working for the homeless in Delhi, however, says, “They say they provide facilities. But the situation is different on the ground… Those who come to these shelters are stuffed into the tents, sometimes without blankets. At least 70 people are stuffed inside a shelter meant for 40. No medical check-ups are done. If one infected person comes in, his blanket is unwashed and repeatedly used by several others. In January this year, a man was found lying near the shelter, dead, his body having been eaten up by rats. We discovered the body even though the place is surrounded by beggars and passers by.”
In death, as in life, they go unnoticed.
Salman, the survivor, doing fine
By Naveed Iqbal
A baby (in picture) lies on the floor in a porta cabin, wrapped in the thin blanket provided by the caretaker of the homeless shelter where his mother lives. Four nights ago, Aabida delivered him on the road outside the shelter without any doctor or even a dear one nearby. The women in the shelter, nearly 30 of them, debate what to call him. “We should call him Salman, like the actor,” one says.
It’s been four days and neither the mother, nor the child has been to the hospital and the visiting doctor only gave the baby a tetanus shot. Riyasat Ali, who heads the shelter home, says they should call him Asad after mentioning a verse from the Quran.
Run in porta cabins outside the Jama Masjid, the shelter houses families, men and women from different parts of the country. One of the cabins is exclusively for women.
The women’s cabin has a capacity of approximately 50 but houses 209. “We try and accommodate as many as we can. It is better than sleeping outside in the cold,” Ruksana, the caretaker, says. There is no guard, no toilets, no hot water or any emergency health kits. Riyasat says the police do rounds of the area and, if needed, are called in. The women work as ragpickers or depend on others’ charity at traffic signals during the day. The children stay back and an NGO worker comes to teach during the day.
Greater effort but numbers too tall
By Mayura Janwalkar
Days after Lt-Governor Najeeb Jung said the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board — the body that provides night shelters to the homeless — must cater to more numbers than required, the DUSIB said it was prepared to accommodate about 16,000 people.
In a status report submitted to the Lt-Governor on Monday, DUSIB said it had provided for 187 shelters. Of these, 85 are permanent shelters that can house 9,104 people and 102 are porta cabins with a capacity to house 5,480 people.
Additionally, DUSIB said 18 canvas tents had been put up to cater to 400 people. The biggest, at AIIMS, can accommodate 100. The DUSIB is in the process of getting three new porta cabins — two at Dandi Park and one at Sarai Kale Khan — which it said should be ready in a month. The report also said DUSIB had decided to put up three more tents at Yamuna Pushta and two more at the Ayurvedic factory behind Hanuman Mandir, Yamuna Pushta. These will be put up in about 15 days.
DUSIB has also converted 10 community halls into shelters. Together, they will accommodate nearly 700 people and are likely to be operational in about 10 days.
Speaking of the 24×7 control room at Punarvas Bhawan near ITO, DUSIB director Kamal Malhotra said it would take another couple of days to finish furnishing it. It will function from December 1 to March 31, 2015.
Malhotra said if a call is received from a shelter, the agency running the shelter will be informed by the control room. “If a homeless person is found on the street, the agency working in that area will pick that person up. We can’t force someone to come to a night shelter. So if someone refuses, the NGO will give that person a bubble-sheet for protection from the cold,” Malhotra said.
At a November 22 meeting, chaired by Union Urban Development Minister M Venkaiah Naidu, DUSIB said it had written to South Municipal Corporation to earmark a space for shelters and hand it over to the board. “The issue of providing shelters for people who come to AIIMS and Safdarjung Hospital for treatment was discussed with the director of AIIMS. He has agreed to provide space for a tent where at least 100 patients/attendants can be accommodated. The superintendent engineer of AIIMS also assured that a new shelter with a capacity of 250 people is being constructed on the campus and will be functional in the next 20 days,” the status report on the meeting said.
Further, DUSIB has designated 19 shelters for women. “These shelters will have CCTV cameras and floodlights,” Malhotra said.
In a recent meeting chaired by the
L-G, which was also attended by the DDA vice-chairman, it was decided that land would be made available to the DUSIB at Re 1 as licence fee. While the DDA will continue to own the land, it will be transferred to DUSIB for construction of shelters. Malhotra said DUSIB has taken possession of nine plots and six other locations will be handed over in 15 days.
The DUSIB has also distributed 24,000 blankets in 184 night shelters.
In a meeting on November 28, Jung told the DUSIB that from December 10, tea and rusk should be served to the homeless every morning at the expense of the Delhi government. He also directed that buses should not used as shelters.
“Buses have a limitation. They cannot be closed fully or made wind-proof. They also occupy more space and metal gets colder fast,”
Malhotra said.
A toilet break that can break the spirit
By Shalini Narayan
At the Lodhi Road night shelter are two porta cabins. While one cabin is women-only, the other accommodates families. Here, most visitors are from UP, Bihar and Bengal. By 11 pm, all those here for the night are settled in.
Located near the Sai Baba temple, the place is surrounded by children and labourers, all of whom manage their meals with food from the temple.
“We usually allow only our regular visitors to come here. The women have their children to take care of. We can’t drive them away. So we don’t follow the system of first-come-first-serve,” Akash Aman, caretaker of the night shelter run by NGO Prerna, says.
As people settle in, the problems within begin to reveal themselves. Blankets lie stacked in the corner with rats under them. Bibi Aisha, who is one of the visitors for the night, barely moves. There is no facility for water. Dogs gather outside for bits of food lying about. Children play around, oblivious to the many health hazards surrounding them.
As night falls, women try and sneak out for toilet breaks without toilets. “The only toilet located nearby shuts by 10 pm and opens only at 8 am. We can’t go out alone, so we have to be accompanied by at least two other women,” Maha Devi, a beggar and mother of six, says.
Aman admits there is a problem. He says, “We are trying to get a toilet here. There is no security but how much can we do?”
“There are 14 night shelters for women in the city, including at Jama Masjid and Karol Bagh. The situation is the same everywhere. There is no security for them. The idea is to give them free lodging for the night but they are either charged money or driven away. And when they have no place to go, they become victims of sexual assaults,” Sunil Kumar Aledia, member, Centre for Holistic Development, an organisation working for the homeless in Delhi, says.
“Statistics show that there are more deaths in summer than in winter. The porta cabins that have been constructed heat up during the summer and they become uninhabitable. The deaths are mostly due to dehydration.”

(Three years after his death,…)
By Brian X. Chen
SAN FRANCISCO - Three years after his death, Steve Jobs is very much a presence in courtrooms across the country. And that's not necessarily good news for Apple.
Next month, the company is set to go to trial in the third major antitrust lawsuit it has faced since Jobs died. His emails will play an important role in the case, as they did in the last two. But lawyers will probably have to work hard to give his statements a positive spin. The potential damages - around $350 million - are a pittance for a company that in its last quarter had an $8.5 billion profit.
Executives are often told by their lawyers to be careful what they put in writing for fear it will end up as evidence in a courtroom. Perhaps Jobs did not get the memo. His emails in past lawsuits - a mix of blunt litigation threats against his opponents and cheery financial promises for potential business partners - have made him an exceptional witness against his own company, even beyond the grave.
The emails in all these cases present the good and bad of Steve Jobs - charmer and bully, someone who may not always have played by the rules. He was a "genius in terms of his vision for the future," said Michael A. Carrier, a professor at Rutgers School of Law. "But it went along with a really healthy ego and perhaps the lack of an antitrust filter - thinking about how these words would appear years later tossed up on the screen in front of a jury."
The latest case to bring Jobs' spirit into a courtroom is set to begin Tuesday in Oakland, California. It is a class action involving older iPods, which played only songs sold in the iTunes Store, or those downloaded from CDs, not music from competing stores. The plaintiffs are consumers who say Apple violated antitrust law because to keep their music, people had to stay with the iPod, and buy higher-priced ones rather than cheaper, alternative music players. Apple has since discontinued this system.
Jobs' emails and videotaped deposition taken before his death, plaintiffs' lawyers say, will portray him as planning to break a competitor's product to protect Apple's grip on digital music.
"We will present evidence that Apple took action to block its competitors and in the process harmed competition and harmed consumers," said Bonny Sweeney, the lead plaintiffs' lawyer.
Apple declined to comment. A few of the emails have already been made public. In one, sent in 2003 to other Apple executives, Jobs expressed concern about Musicmatch, a software company, opening its own music store.
"We need to make sure that when Music Match launches their download music store they cannot use iPod," he wrote. "Is this going to be an issue?" More emails are expected to become public during the trial.
In this case, the overwhelming impression of Jobs is likely to be of an aggressive businessman eager to ensure and protect the iPod's success. In other cases tried since his death, he appears in a far less flattering light - as a ruthless executive willing to strong-arm smaller companies.
In 2010, Apple and five other Silicon Valley companies were accused in a class action of conspiring to keep wages down by agreeing not to recruit one another's workers. The case is set to go to trial in January, after the judge rejected a settlement agreement. Jobs will be a star witness - or his words will. Plaintiffs' lawyers have portrayed Jobs as a ringleader of the conspiracy, pointing to his emails like one sent in 2006 to Eric Schmidt, a Google executive.
 
"I am told that Googles new cellphone software group is relentlessly recruiting in our iPod group," Jobs wrote, according to the court documents. "If this is indeed true, can you put a stop to it?"
Jobs also tried to make a no-poaching agreement with Palm. When a Palm executive rejected that idea in an email, Jobs replied, "My advice is to take a look at our patent portfolio before you make a final decision here" - a threat to embroil Palm in patent litigation.
In 2012, the Justice Department accused Apple and five other publishers of colluding to raise e-book prices. In the trial, government lawyers showed an excerpt from Jobs' authorized biography in which he said he wanted publishers, not retailers, to set the price of titles.
"Yes, the customer pays a little more, but that's what you want anyway," Jobs told the publishers, the biography said.
Throughout the trial, government lawyers frequently brought up an email written by Jobs to a media executive, in which he suggested that by teaming up with Apple, publishers could sell titles for higher than Amazon's $9.99 pricing for e-books.
"Throw in with Apple and see if we can all make a go of this to create a real mainstream e-books market at $12.99 and $14.99," he wrote.

In politics over international airport in western UP  turbulence  airpocketsWritten by Maulshree Seth | Lucknow |
Posted: December 2, 2014 4:31 am
A Union minister’s wish to develop an international airport at Jewar town in Gautam Budh Nagar has opened yet another chapter in the decade-long turbulent politics over setting up and location of such a project in western Uttar Pradesh.
In the past 10 years, four international airport projects have been proposed, shelved and revived in different parts of the state to suit the need of the different regimes both in the Uttar Pradesh and at the Centre.
Union Minister of State for Civil Aviation, Mahesh Sharma, however, seeks to differ. “My vision is clear, if we can have two airports in London or in Washington DC then in order to ease the load at Delhi International Airport, why cannot we have another international airport in its vicinity? Only an airport near NCR can solve the purpose rather than having one in Gorakhpur or elsewhere,” Sharma said talking to The Indian Express.
Sharma, who hails from Gutam Budh Nagar, further said he is “open to all the suggestions” but at the same time “I am ready to face all the hurdles in the way of establishing an airport in Jewar”.
The minister, who made it to the Union cabinet in this moth’s reshuffle, also claimed that it was not worthwhile for the UP government to pursue the case for an airport near Agra in Firozabad because they neither have the land nor the necessary clearance from the Ministry of Defence.
The UP government, however, is in no mood to accept an international airport project in Jewar, which had been aggressively promoted by previous BSP government in the state.
“For us the proposal of international airport near Agra stands as it is. Some time back, Chief Minister had also written a letter to Prime Minister to pursue the clearance from Union Minister of Defence for the international airport in Firozabad,” said Alok Ranjan UP Chief Secretary.
Apart from the airports in western UP, politics has also been played over Kushinagar Airport, first proposed by Mayawati government in 2008 as part of Buddhist Circuit. Initially, the project did not get environment clearance from then UPA government.
However, later after getting approval, UP government acquired about 550 acre land for the project but could not find developers as they felt the project lacked feasibility. Several changes have been made in the project and its cost reduced apart from getting clearance for viability gap funding of about 40 per cent, yet no developers have come forward for the project. Last week, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav wrote to Prime Minister to ensure that Airports Authority of India should take up the Rs 350 crore project. Speaking to The Indian continued…

Triumph apologises for selling bike with wrong specificationsTriumph apologises for selling bike with wrong specifications
Sumant Banerji , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, December 02, 2014

Legendary British superbike maker Triumph on Monday said it would reach out to each of the near-100 customers of its roadster, Street Triple, after facing a backlash for exaggerating the power output of the bike in India by over 25%.
The company had said the Street Triple produces 106 PS power, but this is the European variant. Last month it updated the figures for the Indian version at 79 PS, setting off howls of protest from buyers.
Last Friday, Triumph issued a formal clarification, and promised to redress their grievances.
"It is an error of communication and we should not have used the EU specifications on our website," Vimal Sumbly, managing director, Triumph Motorcycles India told Hindustan Times. "We are doing our best to reach out to each of our Street Triple customers. We will try and understand their grievances and take care of each of the issues. We have been transparent in our approach and Triumph is the only super bike company that gives out detailed specifications of its bikes in India."
Triumph entered India last year, and has 12 bikes in the country, seven of them assembled here. The 650-cc Street Triple was launched in November 2013 and costs `7.65 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi). The engine of the Street Triple is tuned differently for India, Brazil and Japan with a lower power output. The other bikes too have nominal power variations, but the company blamed this on different testing methods and the poor fuel quality.
Triumph said on its Facebook page that the Street Triple sold in India has always been the 85PS variant, and that it understood it has created some confusion with customers. "We request our customers to kindly allow us some time to review and revert on the same," it said.
Customers have been unforgiving. "I tested the (Kawasaki) Z800 also before deciding in favour of the Street Triple. You guys think that if you had told us then that it was 79 PS we would have even test ridden it?" Ronny Sequeira, one of the owners, wrote on the company's Facebook page. "Instead of being downright cheap and slimy do the right thing and issue an apology followed by a deadline by which you (will) rectify this issue… we still love our Street Triple, but please don't treat us as ignorant Indians."

Crude Joke: Fuel price cut not as steep as global fallBrent crude
(Brent crude has dropped…)
NEW DELHI: Oil consumers have so far got only a fraction of the steep fall in crude prices.
Brent crude has dropped about 40% since June, but the price of petrol, diesel, jet fuel and commercial LPG have fallen barely 8%-17%. Prices are down 17% for commercial cooking gas, 14% for aviation turbine fuel (ATF), 11% for petrol, and 8% for diesel.
Executives of state-run oil firms said the price movement of international crude oil and global petroleum products are often not same. International crude prices fall faster than global prices of petroleum products on which domestic retail prices of petrol, diesel, ATF and cooking gas are based, they said.
State oil marketing companies have slashed non-subsidised cooking gas prices by Rs 113 per cylinder and ATF by Rs 2,594.93 per kiloliter from Monday. On Sunday, companies slashed petrol rates by 91 paise per litre in the seventh consecutive cut in four months. Diesel prices fell by 84 paise, which is the third price cut since October 18.
Petrol pump dealers and gas agencies suspected that state oil companies are keeping some margin or the government is using that price cushion to reduce their fiscal burden.
According to government and industry sources, oil companies did not cut petrol and diesel rates in mid-November despite the Centre mopping up Rs 1.5 per litre from petrol and diesel to meet its fiscal deficit target. So far, the government is able to reduce its fuel subsidy burden to below Rs 50,000 crore, sources said. "Pricing of petroleum products are not very transparent and the government should allow an independent regulator to fix and monitor prices, especially when state refiners have near monopoly on sale of auto fuels," a senior executive of a private sector oil company said.
Industry officials say an independent regulator should monitor fuel prices.

(A 14.2-kg cylinder of non-subsidised…)
NEW DELHI: Price of non-subsidised cooking gas (LPG) was today cut by a steep Rs 113 per cylinder and that of jet fuel (ATF) by 4.1 per cent as international oil rates slumped to multi-year lows.
A 14.2-kg cylinder of non-subsidised LPG will now cost Rs 752, down from Rs 865 previously, in Delhi, oil companies announced today.
This is the fifth straight reduction in rates of non-subsidised or market priced LPG, which the customers buy after exhausting their quota of 12 cylinders at subsidised rates, since August.
In five monthly reduction, non-domestic LPG rates have been slashed by Rs 170.5 per cylinder, bringing the price at three-year lows.
On similar lines, the price of aviation turbine fuel (ATF), or jet fuel, at Delhi was cut by Rs 2,594.93 per kilolitre, or 4.1 per cent, to Rs 59,943 per kl. This is the fifth straight monthly reduction in rates.
This reduction follows a steep 7.3 pr cent or Rs 4,987.7 per kl, cut in prices on November 1.
Since August, ATF prices have been cut by 14.5 per cent or Rs 10,218.76 per kl and rates have dipped below Rs 60,000 per kl level for the first time in three years.
Brent, the benchmark grade for more than half of the world's oil, have dropped to USD 68.34 a barrel, the lowest level since October 2009. Prices declined 18 per cent last month and are 38 per cent lower in 2014.
In Mumbai, jet fuel will cost Rs 61,695 per kl from today as against Rs 64,414.98 per kl previously. The rates vary because of differences in local sales tax or VAT. Jet fuel constitutes over 40 per cent of an airline's operating costs and the price cut will ease the financial burden of cash-strapped carriers.
No immediate comment was available from airlines on the impact of the price cut on passenger fares.
The three fuel retailers -- IOC , Hindustan Petroleum Corp and Bharat Petroleum Corp -- revise jet fuel and non-subsidised LPG prices on the first of every month, based on the average international prices in the preceding month.
Yesterday, oil companies had cut petrol price by 91 paisa a litre and diesel by 84 paisa per litre. The seventh reduction in price since August has meant that petrol costs Rs 63.33 a litre in Delhi, Rs 10.27 per litre less than what it cost in July.
The third reduction in diesel rates in one month has led to price coming down to Rs 52.51 a litre.
Non-subsidised LPG in Delhi was priced at Rs 922.50 in July and rates have in every subsequent month been reduced.

(The cabinet expansion is…)
MUMBAI: After months of bickering and posturing, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said on Monday that talks between the BJP and Shiv Sena are headed in the right direction, and the two parties are close to clinching a deal on the issue of power sharing.
The cabinet expansion is likely to happen on or before Thursday, and the Sena will probably be given four to five cabinet positions and a similar number of MoS posts, said top leaders of both parties, paving the way for a reconciliation of the old allies, who had drifted apart after the state elections.
"Our talks with Shiv Sena have been very positive and we have sorted out over 80% of the issues. I am very positive about the outcome, but would request certain leaders from both sides, who aren't involved in the talks, to refrain from making comments," Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said on Monday.
Fadnavis was obviously referring to Sena leader Ramdas Kadam who had publicly claimed a few days ago that Sena's participation in the BJP-led government was ruled out.
"We will not be facing the winter session of the Maharashtra assembly with only the current strength of ministers," Fadnavis said, reaffirming that there will be a cabinet expansion. An official at Mantralaya said that the swearing-in of the new ministers will probably take place on or before Thursday.
On Sunday night, two senior leaders of the Sena met Fadnavis at his residence and discussed the powersharing formula, with Sena president Uddhav Thackeray directing his partymen to stay mum on the talks. But one Sena leader, aware of the developments, informally told ET that Sena does not have much of an issue with the number of seats in the cabinet, but are very concerned about what portfolios they are given. "We want to make sure that portfolios that have some sort of a connect with people are given to us," said the leader on the condition of anonymity.
Thackeray's private secretary Milind Narvekar met Fadnavis again on Monday morning, confirming the back-and-forth that's going on among the top leadership over how many MoS positions that the party would settle for. A top leader from the BJP's state unit said that Public Works Department (PWD) is almost certainly going to be given to the Shiv Sena. Apart from this, Sena is also asking for Water Resources and the MoS post in the Home Ministry. Some details about the other portfolios have to be sorted out, hinted Narvekar.

Only interlocutors should speak: Devendra Fadnavis on BJP-Sena talksBJP
("My request is that if only…)
MUMBAI: In a veiled attack on senior Shiv Sena leader Ramdas Kadam, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis today said "only the official interlocutors in the BJP-Sena talks should comment on the parleys."
"My request is that if only those who are official interlocutors talk (to media), then the process will move ahead," Fadnavis told reporters.
"See, it is like this. If you ask those who come to talk with us, you will know if there is a proposal or not," the Chief Minister said, referring to claims by some in Sena that there was no "concrete proposal" from BJP on Sena's participation in the state government.
Fadnavis, who held meeting with Sena leaders here last night, expressed confidence that a positive outcome would emerge out of the talks.
Two days after BJP formally resumed talks with Sena on the issue of joining the government, Sena leader Ramdas Kadam yesterday accused the estranged ally of "fooling" his party by purposefully dragging on power-sharing deliberations.
Kadam also alleged that BJP leader Eknath Khadse, who is the Revenue Minister, was trying hard to "topple" the Fadnavis government as he was not made the Chief Minister of the state.
The BJP had on Friday said it would talk to Shiv Sena with an "open mind" on the issue of the latter's participation in the Devendra Fadnavis-led government in Maharashtra.
"We are going to meet Shiv Sena leaders with an open mind. We have been allies in the past and the Sena is also part of BJP-led government at the Centre," Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had told reporters before leaving for 'Matoshree', the residence of Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray, where he held talks with Sena leaders for one and a half hour.
"Shiv Sena has been our natural ally. We will hold talks with an open mind," Pradhan had said.
BJP has 121 MLAs in the 288-member House. The NCP, which has 41 MLAs, announced outside support to the state government, but some in BJP are wary of NCP chief Sharad Pawar and are making attempts to rope in Sena, which has 63 MLAs.

BJP fooling Sena by dragging on power sharing talks: KadamBJP
(Ramdas Kadam also alleged…)
MUMBAI: Even as ruling BJP in Maharashtra has formally resumed talks with Shiv Sena on issue of joining the government, Sena leader Ramdas Kadam today accused the estranged ally of "fooling" his party by purposefully dragging on power sharing deliberations.
He also alleged that BJP leader Eknath Khadse , who is the Revenue Minister, was trying hard to "topple" the Fadnavis government as he was not made the chief minister of the state.
"BJP is only fooling us by constantly saying they want us (Shiv Sena) to be included in the state government. If that was the case, why did they keep doing inconclusive talks for one whole month?" Kadam said here.
Observing that Sena has made up its mind to sit in opposition, he said BJP is playing the tactics in a bid to shield itself from Sena's wrath in the upcoming Winter Session of the state Legislature.
"BJP is playing the talks game so that they can protect themselves against us when we rake up issues concerning Maharashtra. They (BJP) are only cheating us by talking about an alliance with us. Nobody trusts BJP now," he said.
Accusing BJP of lacking will power to join hands with Sena again, Kadam said, "Only they (BJP) can say what talks are they exactly conducting at 'Matoshree' (the residence of Thackeray family in suburban Bandra)."
Training his guns on Khadse, whom Sena holds responsible for breaking up of the 25-year-old alliance ahead of the October Assembly elections, Kadam said, "Eknath Khadse has lost sense of what is right and what's wrong.
"He is now trying all possible means to topple the BJP government because he was not made the CM of Maharashtra," he said.
The talks between Sena and BJP are dragging on, apparently over Sena's demand for the post of Deputy CM in Fadnavis-led dispensation and for key portfolios, including Home, whereas BJP is firm on not having a Deputy CM.
However, Sena's support of 63 MLAs is also crucial for BJP which has 121 MLA's in 288-member House to cobble up the magic figure of 145 to have a simple majority.

BSE sensex
(Analysts, including some…)
MUMBAI: A week after several brokerages downgraded corporate earnings for FY15 and FY16, leading market intermediaries like Citi , Morgan Stanley , UBS, and Ambit Capital have said they expect the benchmark index, BSE Sensex, to touch levels between 32,500 and 36,000 by December 2015 - a rise of 14-26% from Monday's closing at 28,559. The Indian market, betting on 'Modinomics', has rallied 34% since January.
These analysts, including some of the closely-tracked names, expect corporate earnings to recover next fiscal year (FY16) as investment cycle turns and consumer spending picks up. While global developments will have their impact - like Monday's 130-point fall in the Sensex following signs of slowdown in Germany and China - a lower inflation on account of easing commodity prices and anticipated interest rate cuts in 2015 is keeping the market sentiment alive. This could compel brokerage houses to later upgrade corporate earnings estimate for the next fiscal year. Traders pruning positions on the eve of RBI's monetary policy also contributed to the fall in stock prices on Monday.
"We expect 2015 to be a good year, hence have raised Sensex target to 33,000 for December 2015, and Nifty to 9,850. We expect gains from falling interest rates, recovery in investment cycle, along with steady execution reforms, which could fire the markets more," said Aditya Narain, managing director, Citi. "We are overweight on banks, energy, cement, pharma and look forward to another good year of Indian markets, although not like 2014 where the index has gained 34% so far."
Brokerages acknowledged that valuations are already pricing in reforms and next year's growth story even as growth cycle remains hesitant and reforms lack the punch to take India's growth higher. But investors on the street are not buying any scepticism.
"Our BSE Sensex target of 32,500 implies mid-teen returns for market next year, and like cyclical stocks and sectors that could benefit from policy changes," said Ridham Desai, managing director at Morgan Stanley. "We assign 40% probability of Sensex scaling to 36,939 levels. However, there is 10% bear case of Sensex falling to 26,007 levels on tepid policy response and poor global economic conditions."
The Sensex is currently trading at 16.83 times to its 1-year forward estimated earnings while China's Shanghai Composite Index is trading at 9.48 times, Brazil's Ibovespa Index at 11.10 times, and Russia's MICEX at 5.02 times, according to Bloomberg data. The index is also trading at over 50% premium to MSCI Emerging Market Index, which is at 11.05 times. But fund managers said valuations are justified as likely economic growth recovery will sustain valuations.
"We remain bullish on Indian equities for 2015 as economic growth recovery will sustain current valuations.
We expect consensus earning growth estimates of 15% for FY16 and FY17 to be met, which will drive the markets higher. Our Nifty target is 9,600 for 2015 end," said Gautam Chhaochharia, managing director at UBS.
"We have Sensex target of 36,000, implying about 27% upside over the next five quarters. We expect earnings growth of 19% in FY16 which is underpinned by our banking team's credit growth estimate of 18% for next fiscal year," said Saurabh Mukherjea, CEO - institutional equities at Ambit Capital.
Foreign institutional investor (FII) flows have hit some kind of speedbreaker, with only $16 billion investment into Indian equities this year so far, which is significantly lower compared with last year's inflows of over $20 billon (2013), and $24 billion in 2012.
Meanwhile, US-based exchange traded funds (ETF) have poured in more than half of investment meant for emerging market into Indian equities in November 2014, according to Bloomberg data.
Emerging market ETFs invested nearly $1.04 billion in November 2014 in equity funds— of which $523 million in Indian equities followed by $373million in China and $162 million in Taiwan.

Veritas Investment Research winds up India business; Cites loss of reputation due to FIRs

FIR
(Canada-based stock research…)
MUMBAI: Veritas Investment Research Corporation, the Canada-based stock research firm best known for its scathing reports, has discontinued all its research on Indian companies.
The firm disclosed this in a suit filed before Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Canada claiming $11 million damages from Indiabulls Real Estate and Indiabulls Housing Finance. Indiabulls had filed FIRs in Mumbai and Gurgaon in August 2012 against Veritas and its two analysts who, in a report, had accused the realty and financial services group of sacrificing corporate governance practices to enrich key shareholders.
In the suit filed by Veritas, the firm alleged that officers of the Indiabulls Real Estate and Indiabulls Housing Finance who affirmed the FIRs worked closely with and actively assisted law enforcement authorities and the crown prosecutor in the early stages of the criminal proceedings. This was followed by Veritas' decision to discontinue the India research services.
"Indiabulls Real Estate and Indiabulls Housing Finance procured the commencement of the criminal proceedings in India with the objective of harming them (i.e. Veritas and its analysts) by preventing or discouraging them from continuing to provide the India research services," said the law suit. "Veritas lost its existing clients for the India research services and significant numbers of prospective clients and suffered substantial business and reputational harm and loss of revenue from what would have been a highly successful business," said Veritas.
On August 8, 2012, Indiabulls filed an FIR against Veritas and its two India born analysts - Neeraj Monga and Nitin Mangal - who authored the report on Indiabulls, with the Gurgaon police and next day with the Mumbai police.
Two years later, last Tuesday, Nitin Mangal surrendered before a Haryana court.
In its lawsuit, Veritas said that despite assuring full co-operation with Indian police or authorities under the India-Canada mutual legal assistance treaty, Indian legal authorities never made any formal request for Canadian legal assistance nor made any meaningful progress in the criminal proceeding against them in India.
On October 30, 2012, Neeraj Monga had sent a mail to Sebi chairman, requesting his intervention following FIRs filed by Indiabulls. Sebi didn't respond to his mail. An e-mail sent to Sebi in this regard did not elicit any response."
Royal Canadian Mounted Police informed me though a letter dated September 25, 2013 that Indian authorities are not co-operating with them on this matter," said Amit Dube, one of the lawyers representing Nitin Mangal.
In October this year, the Delhi High Court, responding to a petition filed by Indiabulls, restrained Veritas from proceeding with the suit in Canada till the case is next heard. The case will now come up for hearing in February 2015. In its petition, Indiabulls alleged that the report published by Veritas was false, misleading, based on concoctions, and defamatory in nature.
They said Veritas had never spoken to them nor verified any facts, figures and data and as a result, the stock price of the Indiabulls companies declined sharply, causing huge loss to the shareholders and the company. Indiabulls also alleged that Monga, Mangal, and Veritas had indulged in extortion and blackmailing.

MUMBAI: Many stock analysts working for equity research firms and brokerages will refrain from appearing on business channels and airing their views to electronic and print media for at least a week till they get some clarity on the Research Analysts (RA) Regulations framed by capital market regulator Sebi. The new rules came into effect on Monday.
According to the RA regulations, no person or entity would be allowed to act as a research analyst or research entity without obtaining a certificate of registration from the regulator. "Public appearance has been defined in the regulation as participation in conference call, seminar, forum, radio or television or Internet or web or print media, authoring a print media article or other public speaking activity in public media in which research analysts make a recommendation of offers an opinion, concerning securities or public offer," said a spokesperson for Edelweiss.
"Hence, it has been decided, by the management at Edelweiss to avoid or cancel any kind of public appearance for a fortnight starting from December 1, 2014."
The regulations were finalised in September this year and are aimed at safeguarding Indian markets from any manipulative research reports, including those by foreign entities.
According to the new norms, entities employing analysts for making stock recommendations would have to be registered after fulfilling the prescribed criteria on qualifications, capital adequacy, establishment of internal policies and procedures, firewalls against conflict of interest, sufficient and timely disclosures, among others. "The RA notification has created lot of confusion among analysts community and hence, we have advised all our research analysts to refrain from making any comments or sharing their views with media till there is some clarity," said a research head of a large retail brokerage.
The regulations provide for penal actions that Sebi can take against erring research analysts. Such actions would include cancellation of registration, debarment, or penalties similar to any other market intermediary.

RBI keeps interest rates unchangedRBI leaves rates on hold, says could ease early 2015

MUMBAI (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India held interest rates steady as widely expected at a policy review on Tuesday, and said it could ease monetary policy early next year provided inflationary pressures do not reappear and the government controls the fiscal deficit.
Uneasy over India's weak recovery from its slowest phase of growth since the 1980s, the six-month-old government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi had been seen as favouring an early reduction in rates.
The finance ministry said later in a statement it looked forward to the RBI's support in "the revival of growth and employment" while adding it would work with the RBI on reducing inflationary expectations and reviving investment and growth.
RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has resisted calls for rate cuts and earlier reiterated his view that containing inflation was a prerequisite for the economy.
"What again and again we have seen in India, and outside India also, is that the way to sustainable growth is to have moderate inflation," Rajan told a news conference.
Forty-one of 45 economists polled by Reuters had forecast that the RBI would keep the repo rate at 8.00 percent, while four had expected a reduction of 25 basis points.
The RBI's next policy review is in early February, and most analysts had expected the central bank would either cut interest rates then or wait until April.
"A change in the monetary policy stance at the current juncture is premature," the RBI said in its statement.
"However, if the current inflation momentum and changes in inflationary expectations continue, and fiscal developments are encouraging, a change in the monetary policy stance is likely early next year, including outside the policy review cycle."
Rajan told a teleconference with analysts that the central bank wants to be confident that underlying trends for non-food inflation were moving in the right direction before reducing interest rates.
India's benchmark 10-year bond yield fell 5 basis points on the day to 8.01 percent as investors cheered the central bank's more dovish stance.
ECONOMY NEEDS MORE THAN RATE CUT
In its statement, the RBI spoke of the need to revive capital investment, and called on the government, which will announce its budget in February, to "stay on course" to meet fiscal deficit targets. Those targets have been jeopardised by  weak tax revenue growth and the slow pace in selling off stakes in state-run companies to raise funds.
Data released on Friday showed economic growth slipped to 5.3 percent year-on-year in the July-September quarter, down from 5.7 percent in the previous quarter. India needs far faster growth to create jobs for all the young people joining its workforce in coming years.
"Things will not pick up just because of rate cuts," said J. Venkatesan, an equity fund manger for Sundaram Asset Management in Chennai. "A strong reforms push is needed to revive economic growth."
Helped by tumbling oil prices, India's annual consumer price inflation (CPI) slowed to 5.52 percent in October, sharply down from a peak of 11.16 percent struck in November last year, but the RBI warned that it expected inflation to rise in December as a favourable base effect wanes.
The RBI has targeted CPI at 6 percent for January 2016, and the central bank said risks to the target "appear evenly balanced under the current policy stance".
Rajan said if that target was achieved the RBI would then aim for a longer-term inflation target of 4 percent.
While there were few expectations that the RBI would cut interest rates this time, officials had told Reuters last week that Finance Minister Arun Jaitley would press Rajan for a reduction when they held a customary meeting before the policy review - though there was no confirmation that the meeting took place.
The central bank is not statutorily independent from the finance ministry, but it enjoys broad autonomy in setting monetary policy, though there are plans to amend the RBI Act and incorporate a monetary policy committee that gives voting rights to officials both within and outside the central bank.
"In the weeks ahead, the government and RBI will work towards a monetary policy framework that will help institutionalize the gains achieved on the inflation front, so as to reduce inflationary expectations and further support the revival of investment and growth," the ministry said.

Apple tumbles as much as 6% in unusual trading
Reuters Dec 1, 2014, 11.01PM IST
(Apple Inc shares tumbled…)
NEW YORK: Apple Inc shares tumbled shortly after the start of trading on Monday, briefly suffering their largest price drop in at least three months on an unusual spike in volume.
Selling accelerated just before 9:51 a.m. EST (1451 GMT), with more than 6.7 million shares trading in a one-minute stretch, the heaviest minute of trading in Apple since Oct. 29, according to Thomson Reuters data.
The stock lost over 3 per cent in that minute, falling as much as 6.4 per cent to $111.27. At mid-afternoon, it was down 3 per cent to $115.45.
The cause of the decline was not yet clear, though traders pointed to institutions using selling programs across a wide swath of stocks. Steve Hammer, a trading educator and founder of HFT Alert in Santa Barbara, California, which monitors algorithmic trading, said about 300 different stocks showed elevated price traffic beginning about 9:50 a.m. EST, a sign of institutions putting on sell programs.
"When you see that kind of price action that is simply algos running stocks," he said.
As of 2:05 p.m. EST (1905 GMT), more than 64 million Apple shares had traded, making it the most active issue in US markets.
A sharp price move coupled with high volume often prompts speculation about the influence of high frequency trading (HFT), when computer algorithms are used to trade stocks at an extremely rapid pace. HFT has been criticized for affecting the trading of stocks by sending in numerous trade quotes that slow quote activity - without filling the trades when shares fall.
"What that is called is evaporation of liquidity, liquidity that was never there in the first place and it's a typical maneuver that goes on in the fragmented stock market we have now," said Joseph Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.
However, determining the cause of the decline wasn't so simple. "The fact is we don't yet know what caused the drop, and blaming it on HFT is misleading," said Bill Harts, chief executive officer of Modern Markets Initiative, an advocate of high-speed electronic markets.
Similar declines on heavy volume, though not as dramatic, were seen in other stocks, including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd , which fell 1.4 per cent in one minute, and the S&P 500 tracking ETF, which had its busiest minute of trading on Monday at 9:51 a.m., when nearly 1.5 million shares traded.
At the day's low, Apple lost more than $40 billion in market value.
The recent ructions in the oil market were also cited as a potential catalyst for the selling in Apple. Traders said the need to free liquidity as oil and energy shares fell could have had an effect on other markets.
"Funds that suffered losses on their oil investments have to get out of their liquid securities in other sectors," said Sam Ginzburg, head of trading at First New York Securities in New York.
  Morgan Stanley strategists dropped Apple's weighting in their strategic portfolio to 3 per cent from 4 per cent in an equity outlook note released Monday, but traders said the swiftness of the decline was too dramatic to be attributed solely to the note, which was released before trading opened.
Saluzzi said "maybe it was the Morgan Stanley news that kind of stimulated the event," but not enough to cause such a decline.

Apple breaks through $700-billion markApple
(Shares of Apple rose 0.8%…)
NEW YORK: Apple, already the world's largest company by market capitalisation, hit a new record value: $700 billion. Shares of the iPhone maker rose 0.8% to $119.59 at 9:35 am in New York on Monday, giving it avaluation of more than $701 billion, a milestone that no other US company has ever reached.
That puts Apple at 1.7 times the capitalisation of the world's second-biggest company, Exxon Mobil. Exxon, which has lost about $43 billion during the five-month oil rout, has a capitalisation of $405 billion.
Confidence in Apple has been growing since the company unveiled larger-screened iPhones in September, followed by slimmer and faster iPads in October. CEO Tim Cook is updating Apple's core products while also pushing users deeper into the company's digital world.
"Given Apple's significant portfolio refresh over the past three months, the lack of innovation from competitors and a constructive spending backdrop in the US market, we believe Apple has opportunity to shine bright this holiday season," Brian White , an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald , said November 24 in a note to investors. Apple is up 48% this year, heading for its sixth straight annual gain.

Debt Markets Start Pricing in Early 2015 Rate Cut; Rally Seen to Continue
Reuters | Updated On: December 02, 2014 19:53 (IST)
Oil Slumps Near $59 for First Time Since 2009 on Oversupply
India's debt and swap markets rallied on Tuesday as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reinforced expectations of an interest rate cut early next year.
The RBI held interest rates steady at a policy review earlier in the day, as widely expected, but said it could ease monetary policy by early 2015 depending on whether inflation cools further and on government efforts to shore up the country's finances.
Indian markets initially extended losses in a knee-jerk reaction to the RBI's decision to maintain status quo on rates, but soon recovered as traders bet on monetary easing at the RBI's next review on February 3.
The benchmark 10-year bond yield, which rose 3 basis points (bps) in the immediate aftermath of the policy review, closed down 9 bps at 7.97 percent, after touching 7.95 percent intraday, its lowest level since July 19, 2013.
Traders said they expect the debt and swap market rally to continue in the near-term, though the pace of the rally may slow until there is more clarity on the timing of the rate move.
"The bond market is running ahead, but there's more conviction about policy easing by February," said A. Prasanna, economist with ICICI Securities Primary Dealership in Mumbai.
Banking stocks also rallied on rate cut bets while state-run banks gained on hopes of large treasury gains due to the fall in bond yields.
The NSE Bank index closed 0.16 per cent higher after dropping as much as 1.2 per cent earlier.
In the overnight indexed swap (OIS) market, the benchmark 5-year swap rate dropped to a low of 7.05 per cent, its lowest since June 19, 2013 while the 1-year swap rate fell as low as 7.67 per cent, its lowest since July 15, 2013.
The 5-year rate ended down 6 bps on the day at 7.10 per cent while the 1-year rate closed steady on the day at 7.75 per cent. Rates rose on profit-booking in the latter part of the session, traders said.
"OIS is pricing in cuts, but that doesn't mean we can't go any lower as everything depends on how fast the RBI cuts rates, which in turn depends on how inflation pans out. I wouldn't pay rates here but bonds definitely offer value," said Kumar Rachapudi, a fixed income strategist with ANZ Bank in Singapore.
"The 10-year bond yield can move to 7.50 per cent once the RBI starts cutting."

Sadiq Jamal Mehtar encounter case: CBI court grants bail to suspended inspector MavaniWritten by Leena Mishra | Ahmedabad |
Posted: December 1, 2014 5:08 pm | Updated: December 1, 2014 5:38 pm
Suspended police inspector R L Mavani got bail in the Sadiq Jamal Mehtar encounter case by a special CBI court. This was the first bail granted in this case where the CBI has seen a direct role of Intelligence Bureau officials in the custodial killing of Sadiq.
The same court also denied bail to  retired Deputy Superintendent of Police (DySP) also known as “encounter specialist” Barot . He  is lodged in jail for almost two years now in connection with the encounter case.
The CBI judge M M Gandhi rejected after hearing both the applications jointly and had reserved the order for pronouncement last week.
The CBI has chargesheeted eight cops in the case including Barot and Mavani for killing Bhavnagar youth Sadiq in January 2003 in a fake police encounter. He was branded as a terrorist who had plans to kill the then chief minister Narendra Modi and VHP leader Pravin Togadia to avenge 2002 riots.
In this case, officers of Mumbai police and IB officers of Mumbai Subsidiary Intelligence Unit are also alleged to be involved. It has been claimed by the CBI that Sadiq was handed over to Gujarat police days before he was killed.

Calligraphist takes Gurmukhi to MoscowWritten by Divya Goyal 2 | Ludhiana |
Posted: December 2, 2014 5:14 am
It has been a story of pleasant ironies for this 43-year old calligraphist Kamaljeet Kaur. An illiterate in Punjabi language till the age of 33, she is all set to represent Gurmukhi script at International Calligraphy Fest in Moscow, Russia.
A born artist, Kaur started with paintings and other art forms since his school days but was not known to art of calligraphy till her friend gifted her a set of fountain pen nibs in school. Even then she started with the art in English and Hindi only.
“I was brought up in Meerut and did my college from Ajmer. Both the cities have no connection with Punjabi. It may sound odd but being a Sikh, I did not know how to read or write Punjabi. My father started writing letters to me in Punjabi, making efforts to make me learn
the language but it did not work,” says Kaur. The love for Gurmukhi script happened much later in 2004, when she was 33 and came to Ludhiana after getting married.
“I was amazed as to how I fell in love with the language while earlier I used to run away from it. I started learning Punjabi alphabets from the internet. Then happened my first calligraphy artwork in Punjabi with Gurbani moolmantra (Ek Onkar, Satnam..) and there was no looking back,” says Kaur, who recently shot to fame with her calligraphy on calendars and swords for Chaar Saahibzaade.
Acrylics, oil paints, watercolors, textures to gold leaf intricate artworks, Kaur is now a perfectionist in all forms of calligraphy that too on various base such as T-shirts, photo frames, mugs, stoles, lamps, greeting cards, paintings, wall hangings, wedding invites, scrolls etc.
The international exposure through internet has made her versatile, she says. “Internet has been my guru of sorts. Interactions with calligraphy artists from Russia and US has made me aware of multiple techniques which Indian artists are generally unaware of. For instance, gouache technique of art under running water is hardly practiced in India,” says Kaur, who has customized Gurbani shabads
in English and Hindi for clients overseas. Kaur makes sure that head in covered, shoes are off and water is pure while calligraphy of Gurbaani or any religious recitals is done at her residence cum studio in Dugri. “At Callifest-2014 in Mumbai, I took workshops to teach
Gurmukhi script calligraphy to various artists. Now I shall be representing Punjabi in Moscow.
It is hard to believe that I was estranged from Punjabi for 33 years,” says Kaur, who is also participating in Delhi International Film Festival this month.
“I have been invited to participate in Moscow Calligraphy Fest in March and represent Punjabi there. All other languages will be represented by various artists,” said Kaur adding that ‘30 years of hardwork in calligraphy has finally paid.’ “I have many clients in Ludhiana but demand is definitely more continued…

50 firemen to receive the Municipal Commissioners Silver Medal for gallantryWritten by Anjali Lukose | Mumbai |

‘If we try hard enough, anything is possible’

Firefighters had just removed a refrigerator and were attempting to remove a slab when they suddenly stopped. Rajendra Bhande (46) had caught sight of a pale hand reaching out from under the rubble.
It was September 27, 2013. The Babu Genu municipal building had fallen like a pack of cards at the Dockyard Road and firefighters were moving debris to look for signs of life. Half an hour later, a family of four was rescued. The refrigerator had been hindering their escape.
Bhande is set to receive his first bravery medal since he joined the Mumbai Fire Brigade in 2000. He was the “first arrival officer” at the spot after he received the “house collapse” call around 5.30 am. He saw a huge heap of rubble and immediately called for eight “crews”. Till noon, he and his team had managed to rescue 20 people.
The family of four were among the first ones to be rescued. Despite the rain and crowd, the firemen successfully rescued 33 injured over two days. Around 60 people lost their lives when the five-storey building collapsed.
The toughest job faced by Bhande and his team was saving the leg of a man trapped under a large slab. Debris had made it impossible to cut the slab. It seemed impossible to save the man’s leg, he was already stuck for several hours, Bhande recounts.
“Only one person at a time could approach the slab and had to cut it piece by piece with a crowbar. Seven of us took turns to cut the slab and finally the man
managed to wriggle his leg out,” he says. “Prayaas karne se sab kuch possible ho sakte hai (If we try hard enough, anything is possible),” is the most important lesson he learnt that day, he adds. “Bahut samadhaan mila us aadmi ka pair bachane ke baad (We felt great satisfaction after that rescue),” Bhande says.
 
‘Thick smoke and gas made it difficult to breath’
Deepak Ghosh
Deepak Ghosh (44) had never seen a submarine up close. On August 14, 2013, he was saving not one but two submarines from being gutted by fire.
A loud explosion, a lightning-like flash in the sky and then the call. Assistant Divisional Fire Officer Ghosh rushed to the Naval Dockyard.
The INS Sindhurakshak, a diesel-powered submarine, had exploded in a dock in Mumbai, with 18 sailors on board trapped inside the vessel. The fire had spread to the external hull of a submarine docked nearby.
Ghosh, who had joined the Mumbai Fire Brigade in 1993, also has a gallantry medal from the President for conducting a rescue operation in Borivali in 2007. He is now set to get a second bravery medal from the municipal commissioner.
A reluctant Navy offered little help in the beginning, understandably, says Ghosh. “We knew people were trapped, but did not know where.
The risk was not revealed to us initially. Firefighting could not begin from all sides because of the sea on one side and extra caution was required because of explosives onboard. Also, firefighters had to focus on keeping the submarine from sinking,” he adds. “We still searched the upper deck, but there was no one there. Thick smoke, very high temperature and gases made it difficult to breath and hindered our vision,” he said. The team stemmed the fire on the adjacent submarine and were able to save it.
After the firefighters put out most of the fire at Sindhurakshak, it sank. The water seeping into the submarine was boiling on instant contact. “Imagine how hot it might have been inside,” Ghosh says.
 
‘Screams for help over the wireless still ring in my ears’
Rajendra Choudhary
The fire “where we struggled to save our own” is how Rajendra Choudhary (52) remembers the blaze that started on the 21st floor of Lotus Business Park in Andheri West on July 19.
Choudhary, Assistant Divisional Officer (Technical), was the oldest in the fire brigade by service, having joined in 1984. He will now receive a bravery medal from the municipal commissioner this month.
The high velocity wind blowing west (seaside) to east, meant the fire atop the 22-storey building was hard to contain. A highrise, with a glass facade offering limited ventilation, a non-functional “riser system”, multiple fires due to “illegal” open electric shafts and a high velocity wind — were just some of the problems that the firemen faced that day.
The “riser system” installed in highrises, which when switched on by fire officials carries water to upper floors, was non-functional. Firefighters had to haul a 160-kg pump up to the 10th floor. “We hauled the pump through the smoke and heat as fire had broken out on 10 and 11th floors as well,” says Choudhary.
As the fire brigade’s 70 m snorkel was just getting the fire on the 21st floor under control, the blaze spread to the terrace and the 19th and 20th floors. Firefighters, who had managed to fight the fire from inside, were trapped with fires raging above and below them. “Their screams for help over the wireless still ring in my ears,” says Choudhary.
That day, the firemen saved 32 lives and lost one of their own. “We found our man by the staircase on the 21st floor. He had succumbed to asphyxiation and had received some burns,” he recounts. Using a helicopter supplied by the Navy, the Fire Brigade managed to airlift one fireman. Still slightly miffed, Chaudhary says, “If the electric shaft was closed, according to norms, the fire would not have spread to the lower floors and had the system been functional, we could have spent more time saving our man.”

Valencia plan life ban for fan who threw bottle at MessiValencia plan life ban for fan who threw bottle at Messi

Barcelona's soccer player Lionel Messi takes part in a commercial event at Camp …
MADRID (Reuters) - Valencia will hand out a life ban when they identify the fan who hit Barcelona forward Lionel Messi on the head with a plastic bottle, the club said on Monday.
Messi was celebrating Barca's 94th-minute winner with his team mates near the corner flag at the Mestalla stadium on Sunday when someone threw the bottle from the stands.
To add insult to injury the Argentina captain was then booked for time wasting.
Messi was examined by a member of Barca's medical staff after the final whistle and did not appear to be hurt, giving the thumbs-up as he walked off the pitch.
"Valencia regret and condemn the isolated incident in the game against Barcelona in which a small, uncapped bottle of water was thrown from the stands at opposition player Lionel Messi," the club said on their website (www.valenciacf.com).
"The club will endeavour to locate the person who threw the bottle and they will be banned for life from the Mestalla. Valencia operate a zero tolerance policy on such actions and rigorously enforce all security measures set out by legislation."
Barca's 1-0 win kept them hard on the heels of leaders Real Madrid who are two points clear of their arch-rivals after 13 matches thanks to Saturday's 2-1 victory at Malaga.
The Catalan club said on Monday they would appeal against the yellow card given to Messi.
The referee said in his match report that it was shown because the player "delayed his return to his half of the pitch after the goal was scored with the intention of wasting time".

Mamata s WB suffers Rs 13600 cr annual post-harvest farm lossBy: Press Trust of India | Kolkata |
Posted: December 2, 2014 5:05 pm
The post-harvest fruits and vegetable losses are valued at over Rs 13,600 crore annually for West Bengal, according to a study condicted by a UK based engineers institution.
“West Bengal faces a shortfall of 12 lakh metric tonnes of cold storage capacity. The post-harvest fruits and vegetable losses are worth over Rs 13,600 crore annually,” Head of Energy and Environment of Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IME) Tim Fox said.
IME had recently conducted a study, “A Tank of Cold: Cleantech Leapfrog to a more food secure world” on farm losses in the country and trying to sentitise cost-effective technologies in cold chain, the most crucial element in stemming farm losses.
In 2013, West Bengal was India’s leading horticulture producing state with over 27,000 tonne of fruits and vegetables accounting for over 10 per cent share of India but the state has only 5.682 million tonnes of functioning cold storage capacity out of national capacity of 30.11 million tonne, the study said.
The institution forecast India’s investment in cold chain to be USD 15 billion over the next five years.
The study highlights that India is the world’s largest producer of milk, and second only to China in fruit and vegetables. Yet agriculture, which makes up 53% of the workforce, generates just 15 per cent of GDP.
The study also points that lack of proper handling and an inadequate cold and frozen supply chain or ‘cold chain’ leads to losses of perishable food produce, such as fruit and vegetables, of as much as 50 per cent every year in India.

Disappointed CEOs expect rate cut by FebruaryDisappointed CEOs expect rate cut by February
BS Reporter | Mumbai Dec 03, 2014 12:48 AM IST
Disappointed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)’s decision to keep key rates unchanged, top chief executives and finance heads of Indian companies now expect the central bank to cut interest rates by early next year. By then, inflation is likely to have come under control.
But they say a rate cut, with the economy moving in the right direction, would have been a good signal to investors. India Inc was pinning hopes on a rate cut to boost interest rate-sensitive sectors such as two-wheelers, cars and real estate.
V S Parthasarathy, chief financial officer of Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), said the policy was on expected lines and RBI’s consistent stand on policy rates was understandable, but a rate cut would have helped.

“The auto industry is still looking for a strong demand revival; lower interest rates would have helped the cause. The policy promises a cut next year, depending on some economic variables, and we hope this will be sooner than later, as it will also give the much-needed thrust to the “Make in India” initiative,” he said.
M&M’s comments come against the backdrop of falling sales of auto companies, especially the two-wheeler manufacturers.
“We were expecting a rate cut to aid the struggling automobile industry and provide the necessary impetus to consumer sentiment. Even after a reduction in the excise duty earlier this year and cooling fuel prices, the customer mood has improved little. There was a slight demand surge, but that was during the festival season and for new entries,” said P Balendran, vice-president, General Motors.
V N Dhoot, chairman & managing director of consumer products maker Videocon, said the policy met expectations and the guidance was dovish. This meant there was a chance of policy easing by February, subject to a moderation in inflation and the government’s efforts to meet fiscal targets.
ALSO READ:  Markets calm as RBI leaves rates unchanged
“I think the central bank could have leveraged abating inflation risks to effect a rate cut, as high cost of credit has been dissuading industry from undertaking capacity expansion,” he said.
Most CEOs said the investment cycle would resume only with a lag of nine to 12 months, as the existing capacity lying idle would have to be filled; industry would invest in new capacity only after that, on the basis of sustainable demand. “Only after inflation has been controlled for a longer period can we hope for a gradual reduction in the interest rate by RBI,” said Prabal Banerjee, president (international finance), Essar group.
“Almost everyone expects RBI would like the benign inflation to sustain and not let it slip — though industry might clamour for a rate reduction. In my view, this is not going to affect growth, as even if the rate is reduced by 50-100 basis points, there is no reason to believe that industry will rush to invest,” Banerjee said.
Some CEOs said even a symbolic cut in policy rates at this juncture would have sent a strong signal that both the government and RBI were acting in concert to harness demand and take the economy to the higher orbit of growth. Industry was hopeful of a rate cut particularly considering that China had surprised its market by reducing interest rates by 40 basis points, to attract investments.
“At a time when the economic recovery is still fragile and industry is growing at a faltering pace, a bold decision from RBI to ease interest rates would have benefited the credit-starved small and medium enterprises, and improved credit offtake by industry,” said CII President Ajay Shriram.
“What’s more, the recent softening of inflationary momentum and the movement of Consumer Price Index towards RBI’s comfort zone indicate that most of the conditions for bringing interest rates down are being fulfilled,” he added.
Lalit Kumar Jain, president of real estate sector’s lobby group, Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India, called for a government intervention to facilitate low-cost funding for real estate developers and buyers. “For a long time, RBI has been consistently taking steps that do not encourage the real estate sector, despite the recognised fact that the industry contributes handsomely to the country’s economy, apart from creating massive employment,” he said.

Myths about noon nap bustedBy: Indo-Asian News Service | London |
Posted: December 2, 2014 5:32 pm | Updated: December 2, 2014 5:34 pm
It is often believed that an afternoon nap can do a body good. But there are people who are not convinced with the power of the afternoon snooze.
Here are common myths about napping listed by huffingtonpost.com:
Myth: Napping is only for the lazy or those under the age of 5.
Fact: A short snooze can boost everything from alertness and memory to creativity and productivity. And not one of those perks sounds like laziness.
Myth: If I take a nap, I’ll only wake up feeling worse.
Fact: That groggy feeling after you wake up from a nap is real, but it’s not a guarantee. How you feel after your snooze is probably a factor of how long you slept. Experts generally agree that a nap should last no longer than 30 minutes.
“If you take it longer than 30 minutes, you end up in deep sleep,” said sleep expert Michael J. Breus.
Anyone who has ever felt worse upon rising from a nap is “sleeping too long,” he added.
Myth: Coffee before a nap will keep me up.
Fact: There is such a thing as a caffeine nap — affectionately referred to as the nappuccino. To do it right, enjoy that cup of coffee or tea, and then take your nap. As you sleep, the caffeine will begin to kick in (it reaches peak effectiveness about 30 minutes after you drink it), so that when you wake, you’ll be feeling your most refreshed.

“I am saddened to hear about the demise of Devenji. My heartfelt condolences to his family,” said Aamir in a statement.
“He was a wonderful co-star. I remember on the sets of ‘Andaz Apna Apna’ he always had a joke on his lips and kept us all in high spirits,” he added.
Though Deven’s role as Aamir’s father was small, he shined through the film due to his performance.
Released in 1994, the film also featured Salman Khan, Karisma Kapoor, Raveena Tandon and Shakti Kapoor. It was directed by Rajkumar Santoshi.

Telecom Commission Likely to Meet on December 8
Press Trust of India | Updated On: December 02, 2014 21:59 (IST)
Up to 7 No Production Days a Month Till March: Mahindra
New Delhi: Inter-ministerial panel Telecom Commission (TC) is likely to meet on December 8 to deliberate on the next round of spectrum auction proposed to be held in February.
"The meeting is likely to be held on December 8 but the agenda has not been finalised yet," a DoT source told PTI.
The next round of spectrum auction is proposed to be held in February and the government is estimated to garner at least Rs 9,355 crore from sale of radiowaves.
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has already submitted its revised recommendations on the pricing of 800, 900 and 1800 MHz bands.
The telecom regulator has reiterated its recommendations for 900 and 1800 Mhz bands while it has increased the base price by 15 per cent for 800 MHz band.
The Department of Telecommunications (DoT)  had sent back TRAI's recommendations on 800, 900 and 1800 MHz bands for reconsidering some points.
The Telecom Commission will discuss the recommendations to take a call on the reserve price and other details regarding the auction.
Most of the spectrum which is proposed to be put up for sale is being used by Airtel, Vodafone, Idea Cellular and Reliance Communications across various parts of the country. These companies will need to buy back  radiowaves to continue their operations in areas where their licences are expiring in 2015-16.
The sectoral regulator (TRAI) has also released a consultation paper on pricing of 2100 MHz band, used for offering 3G services, as the government plans to auction this band along with 800, 900 and 1800 MHz in February.
Telecom companies as well as the regulator have been of the view that the auction should take place only when adequate spectrum is made available, and the bidding should be held simultaneously for both the services - 2G and 3G.

Another video of Rohtak girls goes viral; they say more may surfaceRohtak sisters seen bashing up harassers in another video that goes viral
HT Correspondents , Hindustan Times  Rohtak, December 02, 2014

Comments
Another video of the Rohtak girls, who thrashed three eve-teasers with belts and punches, went viral on Tuesday, in which they were seen beating up and abusing a boy sitting in HUDA City Park.
The new video has sparked a debate in social circles and polarised the issue. People raised eyebrows as the video shows the duo thrashing and using expletives against a boy. Pooja Kuhar, the younger of the two sisters, said this incident occurred around two months ago. She said they beat him because he had passed a lewd comment at them.
She added that she, along with her sister, Aarti Kuhar, had beaten up several boys in last one year and many more such video can surface.
On being asked on how they felt about the limelight on them, Pooja said, "We are not interested in becoming a star or seeking publicity at the cost of our dignity. We are simple girls but what sets us apart is that we believe that tolerating injustice is also wrong, which other girls might face quietly," adding, "The support came from society after the incident was highlighted by the media and it has made us stronger and we feel safer."
The younger sister, Aarti, also had a message to other girls, "If a boy passes a lewd comment on girl, a girl's first mistake is to take it casually."
Meanwhile, the three accused - Kuldeep, Deepak and Mohit - were granted bail. Confirming the development, Rohtak jail superintendent Daya Nand said they were released on Monday.

Thiruvananthapuram, December 2:  
Prizm Payment Services, a Hitachi group company, has launched Money Spot, its white label ATM brand, in Kerala in association with Muthoot Fincorp.
The RBI has permitted non-bank entities to open ATMs that do not display a bank logo and are hence called white label ATMs.
Prizm has set up two such ATMs; one at Kesavadasapuram here and the other at Kakkanad, Kochi. Going forward, the two players intend to jointly put up 500 ATMs across the country, according to a Prizm spokesman.
Prizm currently has over 1,200 Money Spot ATMs across the country and intends to install at least 9,000 more.
Rapid growth
Loney Antony, Managing Director, Prizm, and Thomas John Muthoot, Chairman and Managing Director, Muthoot Pappachan Group, jointly opened the ATM at Kesavadasapuram on Monday.
As on March 2014, India had a total of 1,60,005 ATMs, of which 58 per cent are in metro and urban centres, 27 per cent in semi-urban centres and only 14.5 per cent in rural centres.
Rural focus
Prizm intends to focus on semi-urban towns and rural areas and deploy a large number of Money Spot ATMs in such locations, the spokesman said.
It hoped to benefit from Muthoot Fincorp’s presence and reach in the semi-urban and rural areas.
“We are also keen to explore other opportunities with the Muthoot Pappachan group,” said Loney Antony with reference to the parent company of Muthoot Fincorp.
Thoms John Muthoot said the association would help his company reach out to customers from all banks and get connected with the entire ATM network in the country.

Cabinet clears changes to Companies Act for ease of doing bizGovt considering 6 FDI proposals in single-brand retail
Within months of the new Companies Act coming into force, the government today cleared a slew of changes to this law to make it easier for corporates to do business and to ensure severe punishment for those raising illegal deposits from the public.
This would be among the first major initiatives by the government to make changes in the country’s regulatory framework to improve its global ranking for ease of doing business, where India has been ranked very low at 142nd position in the latest World Bank report.
The 14 proposed amendments, which were approved by the Union Cabinet this evening, also include provision to ensure that frauds beyond a certain threshold would need to be mandatorily reported by the auditors to the government.
To address concerns raised by the corporates, the government has also agreed to relax a number of norms including those pertaining to related party transactions, while resolutions passed by the companies’ boards would not be subjected to public inspection.
The new Companies Act, which came into force with effect from April 1 with some provisions yet to become operational, has faced stiff criticism for many provisions.
The new law, put in place by the previous government, has replaced a nearly six-decade old Companies Act, 1956, but the new government has been indicating for quite some time that it would bring in necessary changes to address concerns raised by various stakeholders including corporates.
The Companies (Amendment) Bill, 2014, cleared by Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, would now go to the Parliament to bring into effect necessary amendments to the existing Act.
The Companies Act, 2013 was notified on August 29, 2013. Out of 470 sections in the Act, 283 sections and 22 sets of Rules corresponding to such sections have so far been brought into force.
The government said in a statement that these amendments have been proposed to address issues raised by stakeholders such as chartered accountants and professionals.
To improve ease of doing business, the proposed amendments include omitting requirement for minimum paid up share capital, and consequential changes and making common seal optional, and consequential changes for authorization for execution of documents.
Besides, specific punishment will be prescribed for non-compliance to norms governing deposits taking activities. Such a provision was “left out in the (existing) Act inadvertently”.
Enabling provisions are being put in to prescribe thresholds beyond which fraud shall be reported to the central government, while cases below this threshold will be reported to the audit committee of the company’s board.
Disclosures for both the categories would need to be made in the board’s report, the government said, while adding that this provision has been made at the demand of auditors.
Besides loans given by a company to wholly owned subsidiaries and guarantees/securities on loans taken from banks by subsidiaries, would be exempted from the purview of related party transactions.
“This was provided under the Rules but being included in the Act as a matter of abundant caution,” the government said.
In another major step, it has been proposed to replace “special resolution with ordinary resolution for approval of related party transactions by non-related shareholders.
This would address “problems faced by large stakeholders who are related parties,” the government said.
Besides, related party transactions between holding companies and wholly owned subsidiaries have been exempted from the requirement of approval of non-related shareholders.
Further, the government has decided to prohibit public inspection of a company’s board resolutions filed in the Registry and would include provision for writing off past losses/ depreciation before declaring dividend for the year.
Besides, the audit committee of a company would be empowered to “give omnibus approvals for related party transactions on annual basis”.
This would also align provisions of the Act with that of capital market regulator Sebi’s policy.
Taking into consideration the demand of corporates, the government would rectify the requirement of transferring equity shares for which unclaimed/unpaid dividend has been transferred to the IEPF (Investor Education and Protection Fund) even though subsequent dividend has been claimed.
In addition, the winding up of companies would be heard by a two-member instead of three-member bench.
Among others,”bail restrictions to apply only for offence relating to fraud under section 447 of the Act.
Enabling provisions to prescribe thresholds beyond which fraud shall be reported to the Central Government (below the threshold, it will be reported to the Audit Committee).
Another amendment is to ensure that special courts would try only offences carrying imprisonment of two years or more so that minor violations can be taken care by magistrates.

Shome panel wants govt to tax you for your cash withdrawalGovt considering 6 FDI proposals in single-brand retail
A high level official panel today proposed levying of banking transaction tax on withdrawal of cash beyond a specified limit in a day to check black money and was not in favour tax amnesty scheme.
A report by the Parthasarathi Shome Committee, appointed by the previous UPA government, suggested taxing farmers with large land holdings in addition to host of measures to widen the net.
“Taxpayers keep waiting for amnesty schemes to be announced and take advantage of these schemes to build their capital.
“Amnesty schemes also cause inequity among taxpayers, and there is no proof that they improve taxpayer behaviour among evaders. They, therefore, should not be encouraged through amnesties,” said the report of Tax Administration and Reform Commission (TARC). It was the third report in the series.
Highlighting that there is no instrument at present that captures details of cash withdrawals from bank accounts, it said such information would help the I-T department widen its information base on the use of black money.
Making a case for Banking Cash Transaction Tax (BCTT), it said: “…IT Act should be suitably revised to include in its ambit cash withdrawals exceeding specified amounts in a day from bank accounts other than savings accounts.
“Alternatively, BCTT should be reinstated as an effective administrative measure”.
BCTT was introduced in June 2005 to track unaccounted money and trace its source and destination, but was withdrawn in April 2009.
BCTT was levied in respect of cash withdrawals in a day exceeding Rs 50,000 in the case of an individual and Rs 1 lakh in the case of other persons.
The report further said large farmers should be brought into the tax net.
“Against a tax free limit of Rs 5 lakhs on agricultural income, farmers having income above much higher threshold income, such as Rs 50 lakh, could be taxed. This will broaden the taxpayer base,” it said.
Talking about other steps to widen tax net, it said a conducive environment and tax culture should be created to encourage unorganised retailers to pay tax dues voluntarily.
The panel also recommended that wealth tax base can be increased by including intangible financial assets in the base while considerably raising the threshold and decreasing the wealth tax rate.
There has been increase in the number of non-corporate taxpayers for the categories Rs 2-5 lakh and Rs 5-10 lakh over the period 2007-12 but only a moderate fluctuation in the category below Rs 2 lakh over the same period.
Only 33 per cent of registered persons under service tax filed returns in 2012-13 and the number fell short of the previous year’s figure by approximately 1 lakh. Also, more than 50 per cent of registered central excise taxpayers are not filing returns.
It also pitched for tax administration measures to improve SMEs tax compliance.

Neeti Aayog: Modi to meet CMsNeeti Aayog: Modi to meet CMs
Sanjeeb Mukherjee | New Delhi Dec 03, 2014 12:49 AM IST
Taking forward the concept of Team India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to meet chief ministers twice on Sunday to formalise the contours of the new body that will replace the Planning Commission.
Officials said the prime minister would first meet the chief ministers, along with their officials, in the morning. A separate session will follow, in which Modi would meet only the chief ministers.
The meetings are part of the government effort to build a broad consensus on the shape of the new body that will replace the commission.
"Letters are being dispatched to the chief ministers inviting them for the crucial meeting," a senior official said.
The new body - likely to be called Neeti Aayog - is expected to comprise the office of Direct Benefit Transfer, Unique Identification Authority of India, the inter-state councils and Programme Evaluation. Each of the four departments will be headed by a secretary-level officer.
Modi, in his maiden Independence Day speech, had announced the winding up of the five-decade old Planning Commission, replacing it with a new body. The government held a series of meetings with experts and analysts on its shape.
In between, the role and functions of the commission was gradually reduced. Its financial might was clipped through a recent circular which directed all major ministries and departments to furnish their Plan Budget estimates for 2015-16 directly to it.

Reassessing  no-first use  policy: RSS body wants Modi govt to revisit nuclear doctrineRSS body wants Narendra Modi government to revisit nuclear doctrine
Ajmer Singh, ET Bureau Dec 3, 2014, 07.02AM IST

(When asked if he had any discussions…)
NEW DELHI: "The Narendra Modi government is working on a plan to revisit India's nuclear doctrine, and we are appreciative of our political leadership that is sensitized to this reality and heading in that direction," Indresh Kumar, RSS leader and chief patron of a Sangh-affiliated think-tank, has told ET.
Last Saturday, Kumar was the chief speaker at a National Executive meeting of the Forum for Integrated Security (FINS) held in Chhattisgarh where it was proposed that India revisit its nuclear doctrine — essentially reassess its "no-first use" policy — besides adopting a 'pro-active' approach on Chinese incursions.
When asked if he had any discussions with the PM and National Security Advisor on this subject, Indresh Kumar refused to comment, but he said nuclear power has to be used for welfare and world peace, it cannot be the sole prerogative of any superpower.
ET has accessed a booklet, meant for in-house circulation among FINS office-bearers. The preface by FINS President Lt Gen DB Shekatkar says that "the new government at the Centre needs to revisit the Nuclear Doctrine as has been mandated by the Doctrine itself, reconsider probable changes if necessary and strengthen the strategic and security infrastructure of the country."
"Should we still remain captive to no-first use (NFU) commitment, what should be our response to our hostile neighbour, who possesses tactical nuclear weapons and whose declared philosophy and doctrine is that the nuclear bombs/Missiles in possession of this neighbour is only against India? Should we wait for the first strike against us or do we need to formulate a doctrine and policy to prevent such strike at all costs?..We must remember that in 21st century philosophy of survival of fittest must be replaced by survival of fastest, unless we can preempt, we cannot survive," Lt Gen Shekatkar says in the preface.
In April, BJP in its manifesto had stated that it will "study in detail nuclear doctrine, and revise and update it, to make it relevant to challenges of current times... Maintain a credible minimum deterrent that is in tune with changing geostatic realities."
One of the participants at National Executive meeting, Pravesh Khanna, who is also general secretary of FINS (Delhi), confirmed the developments. "We have shortlisted eight issues and made special cells, which will be taken up with the government.
These include a need to revisit nuclear doctrine, Indian defence programme, India-China relations, Naxal problem, ISIS , terror groups and its spread, maritime security, neighbouring countries and foreign relations, we shall have inputs from scholars and defence experts and present it to the government," he told ET.

Radio taxis seek simpler payment norms from RBIRadio taxis seek simpler digital payment norms from RBI

Digital Payment
(Companies want end to two-step…)
NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: Top radio taxi operators such as Meru, Mega Cabs and Easy Cabs have approached the Reserve Bank of India, seeking easier digital payment norms for taxi commuters who typically pay small amounts, backing a demand from rivals such as Uber and Ola Cabs.
Under the umbrella of Radio Taxi Association of India , they have urged the central bank to do away with two-factor authentication for small taxi fares of Rs 500-1,000.
"A lot of countries don't require two-factor authentication for small amounts," said Kunal Lalani, president of the association and CEO of Mega Cabs that operates over 2,500 cars in the country.
Interestingly, earlier this year the same association had approached RBI for clarification on how San Francisco-based Uber was operating in India without a two-step authentication.
But now all top radio taxi operators have mobile apps with which customers can book and pay for rides. They want RBI to let taxi service providers operate digital wallets without the need for payment gateways in between.
"We have suggested to RBI to let us start and operate semi-closed wallets which can then be used to buy other things as well," said Siddharth Pahwa, CEO and founder of Meru Cabs, which earned gross revenues of over Rs 420 crore, last year, mostly in cash payments.
The taxi association, which has 10 members including TabCab and QuickCabs, also appealed to RBI to allow them to offer overdraft facility up to a certain amount to passengers who overshoot wallet limits during a ride. "Customers won't wish to haggle with taxi drivers for small amounts if their wallet balance is low. It's a small risk and we can take that," said Rajiv K Vij, MD and CEO of Carzonrent that operates Easy Cabs and has a turnover of over Rs 300 crore.
Uber offers Indian customers a facility to overshoot taxi bills, though one can book a new ride only after settling previous bills.
India's unorganised taxi market is estimated at $6-8 billion (approximately Rs 37,200-49,600 crore) with about 600,000 commercial vehicles.
Uber, which now asks all consumers to pay through a mobile wallet in keeping with norms laid down by the central bank, too had said the two-factor authentication is an antiquated solution cumbersome for consumers and stifling for businesses. "We believe this is unnecessary and burdensome and have engaged in constructive discussions with the RBI," it said in a post on its India blog.
Taxi service aggregators like Uber, Ola Cabs and TaxiForSure are not part of the radio taxi association. They claim to be an application and not a radio taxi operator, which has to take licences from each state to operate.
Meanwhile, payment solution providers are working around a solution that can auto-read one-time passwords SMSed to users when they pay taxi fare through the app.

Business-friendly India is abuzz with privat...A380
(Key international carriers…)
NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: India is again on the priority list of the global business fraternity and they have started flocking to the country in huge numbers since the assumption of office by the new government. One sign of this lies in the sharp increase in international private jet flights recorded at airports across the country and an increase in occupancy in business class cabins by key international airlines.
An Airports Authority of India data shows that the international jet flight movements have seen a consistent increase since July this year. While the increase in July was 24%, it increased by 45% in August. There were smaller increases of 9.7% and 5.9% in September and October. General aviation charters are measured in terms of aircraft movements — two of them for every takeoff and landing.
Key international carriers like British Airways and Lufthansa are also reporting an increase in occupancy in the business class cabins of their aircraft flying to India.
"The market slowed down during elections. In the last three four months, we have seen an uptick in demand for business class seats with the companies renewing their plans. I am pleased with the performance of the Delhi sector in the last four months," British Airways Executive Chairman Keith Williams told ET.
While Lufthansa also echoes the view on increase in demand for business class seats in their aircraft, it says that they are adding capacity in the sector.
"Yes, the demand for business class has been on the rise and we now see people traveling business class not only on work but also on leisure which is an encouraging trend. With growing demand from the Indian market, we have deployed aircraft with additional capacity (including business class seats) such as the A380 which has 92 business class seats," said Wolfgang Will, Director-South Asia of Lufthansa.
While airlines did not comment on the increase in fares reported due to an increase in demand, travel industry insiders say that the increase has been huge in flights to Singapore and Europe.
Travel industry analysts also say that the inbound international flights are seeing an increase in demand primarily due to investors coming into India.
In the last few months, India has witnessed the visit of several top corporates who have all expressed enthusiasm about the change in governance. Some have outlined major plans for India.
In October, Facebook CEO and one of the world's youngest billionaires Mark Zuckerberg made his maiden business trip to India and visited Narendra Modi to discuss digital expansion in the subcontinent.

Eleven more bodies have been recovered from the western Bering Sea near where a South Korean fishing ship sank earlier this week.
Kim Kang-ho from Sajo Industries, which owns the ship, said Wednesday that the bodies appear to be from the ship lost Monday in the waters near Russia. One fisherman’s body was recovered Monday and seven fishermen were rescued. More than 50 are missing.
The bodies were found by fishing vessels searching the debris of the sunken Oryong 501, said Kim.
Furious relatives have blamed the company and the ship’s captain for not doing enough to save their family members.
Officials from the ship’s company said they were hanging onto a “glimmer of hope.” But with continued rough seas and bad weather there were dwindling expectations that the fishermen would be found.

Coast guard helicopters from Russia and the United States and at least five fishing ships were searching for the missing, according to an official from Seoul’s foreign ministry, who didn’t want to be named citing office rules. He said the U.S. rescue ship Munro should arrive Thursday to help the search effort.
The crew included 35 Indonesians, 13 Filipinos, 11 South Koreans and one Russian inspector, according to the South Korean government. It’s believed the ship began to list after stormy weather caused seawater to flood its storage areas, according to officials from the government and the company that owns the ship.
The ship left South Korea on July 10 to catch pollock, a winter delicacy in South Korea, according to company officials. The sinking struck a nerve in a country less than eight months from its deadliest maritime disaster in decades. The sinking of the Sewol ferry off South Korea’s southwestern coast in April left more than 300 passengers continued…

Ranbaxy in talks with CCI on  specific products  for Sun dealRanbaxy in talks with CCI on 'specific products' for Sun deal
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: December 3, 2014  | 10:21 IST
Awaiting a long-pending approval for its merger with Sun Pharmaceutical, drug maker Ranbaxy said it is in talks with fair trade watchdog CCI with regard to "certain products".
"We are in communication with the Competition Commission of India (CCI) on specific products and as of now have not received any final order from the CCI regarding divestment of the products," Ranbaxy Laboratories said.
The statement was made in reply to a clarification sought by the National Stock Exchange (NSE) from the company on reports that CCI wants changes to its deal with Sun Pharmaceutical.
The $4-billion deal, which CCI has prima-facie found to be in violation of competition norms, was inked in April this year.
Competition Commission of India (CCI) has suggested Sun Pharma and Ranbaxy to make certain changes in their proposed merger deal, including possible divestment of some brands, to address anti-competitive concerns.
Sources had said the regulator is now awaiting response from the parties on the suggested changes.
Among others, CCI is believed to have suggested divestment of some brands in order to comply with competition norms, sources had said.
Sun Pharma-Ranbaxy transaction, which would create the country's largest pharmaceutical company, had come under close scrutiny of CCI after it was found prima-facie that the "combination is likely to have an appreciable adverse effect on competition".
The combined entity would have operations in 65 countries, 47 manufacturing facilities across 5 continents, and a significant platform of speciality and generic products marketed globally. The deal is also the first one where the commission sought public comments.
Major issues examined by CCI on the deal are with respect to the molecules market.
On Monday, Sun Pharmaceutical said that CCI has been seeking additional information and detailed clarifications with respect to specific aspects of the products for the purpose of making its assessment.
"We see the process nearing its logical closure. We are happy with the open and transparent manner in which the matter has progressed. It is our intent to fully comply with all the regulatory requirements as required to close the transaction," Sun Pharma had said in a statement.

Actor Bradley Cooper says he had to gain weight naturally, without supplements, to portray a Navy Seal in Clint Eastwood’s new movie.
The ‘American Hustle’ star, who plays the real-life hero Chris Kyle in ‘American Sniper’, said he feared his past struggles with addiction would come back to haunt him if he started popping pills, reported Contactmusic. “I did it naturally because I’ve been sober for 10 years and didn’t want to do anything.”
“I had a realistic conversation: ‘Can I do this in three months naturally? Can I gain 30 pounds of muscle?’ I didn’t know if I would be able to do it or not. Thank God, luckily, my body reacted fast,” he said.

50 Cents bank accountfrozenBy: Press Trust of India | Los Angeles |
Posted: December 3, 2014 10:16 am
Rapper 50 Cent reportedly cannot draw any money from his bank account after it was frozen. The 39-year-old rapper had his personal account frozen because he failed to pay USD 17.2 million in judgment to Sleek Audio after he lost a lawsuit against the company earlier this year.
A source additionally said the rap mogul still had access to his business accounts, reported TMZ. Headphone company Sleek Audio previously claimed the rapper stole their design and promoted it with SMS Audio. A judge then decided that Cent should pay the company for the damages as well as the legal fees. An attorney for 50 Cent has responded to the story that the account was frozen.
The attorney said that they were filing an appeal against Sleek Audio. The attorney also commented that the manufacturer was “desperately attempting” to get money from his client. The rapper’s legal team also gave confirmation that his assets were “appropriately protected”.

Maharashtra government seeks Rs 4 500cr package from Centre to helpfarmersBy: Press Trust of India | Mumbai |
Posted: December 3, 2014 10:10 am
Concerned over the recent farmer suicides, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has said his government is working round-the-clock to mitigate their hardships and has sought a Rs 4,500 crore financial package from the Centre to provide them necessary assistance.
The Chief Minister said he was saddened by reports of farmers committing suicide because of bad crop and drought and appealed to the farmers not to lose heart and assured them that his government was doing all that is possible to help them.
The drought situation is severe and decisions like waiving electricity bills, fees waiver of 10th and 12th class students in drought-hit areas, restructuring of crop loan and stay on recovery of loan have already been taken, Fadnavis said in a statement issued here.
He said that his government was constantly monitoring the situation and firmly stood by the farmers in the grave situation.
A 75-year-old farmer, distressed over crop failure, had allegedly ended his life at a village in Akola district last week.
Besides, seven suicides by debt-ridden farmers were reported in the past few days from Vidarbha, which was toured by Fadnavis last week, according to Vidarbha Janandolan Samiti (VJS), an NGO which has been tracking such deaths.
With these deaths, the number of farmer suicides in the cotton belt, facing water scarcity and agrarian crisis, has gone up to 1,022 till now this year, Samiti’s president Kishore Tiwari recently claimed.
A delegation of farmers led by Tiwari had met Fadnavis in Amravati last week and presented a list of demands.

Thousands gather to bid final farewell to PhillipHughesBy: Associated Press | Macksville |
Posted: December 3, 2014 10:07 am | Updated: December 3, 2014 10:58 am
The funeral for cricketer Phillip Hughes turned into a celebration of his life on Wednesday despite the grief and sorrow still evident from his death.
Australia captain Michael Clarke and the rest of the test squad were joined by former and current players from around the world, and friends and relatives from Hughes’ hometown of 2,500 people on the northern coast of New South Wales state, 575 kilometers (350 miles north of Sydney).
Clarke was a pallbearer and spoke at the funeral service held at the Macksville Recreation Centre and which opened to the song “Forever Young” by Youth Group.
The service closed with Elton John’s “Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me,” the same song the famous entertainer and avid cricket fan performed at a concert last weekend in Germany in tribute to Hughes.
Hughes died last Thursday, aged 25, after being hit near the ear by a ball during a match at the Sydney Cricket Ground. His 26th birthday would have been Sunday.
In steaming temperatures of nearly 30 Celsius (85F) early arrivals to the service, including Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, fanned themselves with papers. Most of those who wore sports jackets and blazers had taken them off, some with sleeves of their white shirts rolled up to their elbows.
At the front of the hall, near the altar for the Roman Catholic service, was Hughes’ oak brown casket. Flowers and cricket bats, one with his test cap on the handle, were nearby.
Leading the service, which included a video tribute, Father Michael Alcock remembered the batsman as a “shining light.”
“In his short time he walked as a child of the light, not in an ostentatious way but in a natural, unassuming and passionate way,” the priest said.
Clarke, who has described Hughes as the brother he never had, broke down frequently last weekend at the SCG when he first commented on his close friend’s death.
On Wednesday, he took several deep breaths before he began his remarks at the funeral, saying Hughes would “definitely call me a sook right now.”
“I don’t know about you, but I keep looking for him,” Clarke said. “I want to see his face pop up around the corner.
“I can see how he has touched so many people around the world … so rest in peace my little brother, see you out in the middle.”
The funeral was broadcast live around Australia on commercial television stations and on video screens at the Adelaide Oval, where the rescheduled first test with India will start next Tuesday, and the SCG, where a row of 63 bats were propped up against pickets, each with an inscription of a special moment of Hughes’ career.
Television footage showed residents of Macksville gathering in a park near the funeral for a telecast. Owners of many shops and businesses shut down to attend continued…

NCP chief Sharad Pawar slips during morning walk  taken to Mumbai by airambulanceBy: Express News Service | Mumbai |
Posted: December 4, 2014 12:03 am | Updated: December 4, 2014 1:16 am
NCP chief and Rajya Sabha member Sharad Pawar was brought to Mumbai in an air ambulance Wednesday morning after he fell down at his residence in New Delhi and fractured his right leg. He is likely to undergo a surgery on Friday.
Pawar was rushed to the city-based Breach Candy Hospital around 11 am and his air ambulance landed at the Chhatrapati Shivaji domestic airport. He is under the care of Dr Arun Bipin Mullaji, a consultant orthopedic surgeon.
Pawar will have to undergo a minor surgery for his fracture and has been advised to stay at the hospital for five to six days. Doctors have conducted a full check-up and have ruled out anything serious. He was brought here because he was previously treated here. He will be back in action in a few weeks’ time,” said NCP leader Praful Patel, who along with party colleague Nawab Malik visited the 74-year-old politician.
According to Patel, Pawar lost balance and fell at his house around 9 pm Tuesday night and was rushed to a nearby hospital in Delhi for an X-ray. Nawab Malik said he sustained a fracture on his upper thigh.
Pawar’s wife Pratibha and daughter Supriya Sule accompanied him from Delhi. The authorities made an exception allowing the air ambulance to land at the domestic airport instead of the Juhu aerodrome.
In March 2013, Pawar had fallen ill and was airlifted from Kolhapur to Pune for treatment of high blood pressure. Previously, he has been admitted at least twice, in 2010 and 2012, to Breach Candy hospital.

Australia bids farewell to Phillip Hughes in hometown funeral

(Bowler Sean Abbott, who…)
MACKSVILLE (AUSTRALIA): Australia bid an emotional farewell to cricketer Phillip Hughes at a funeral in his hometown on Wednesday with a live coast-to-coast broadcast allowing a nation to unite in celebration and remembrance of the life of a sportsman cut down in his prime.
Eight days after Hughes was struck by a ball to the back of the head, and six after he died of catastrophic injuries resulting from the freak incident, his family, friends and a host of cricketing greats gathered at Macksville High School.
From the eulogies given they learned of a beloved son, brother, cousin and friend whose passion for cricket was matched only by his enthusiasm for the Angus cattle he helped raise on the family farm.
They were also reminded of a small town boy with a prodigious talent for hitting a ball with a bat who headed down the coast to big city Sydney as a teenager and ended up playing 26 tests for his country.
Australia captain Michael Clarke broke down in tears for the second time in a few days as he paid public tribute to his former team mate and friend, who would have been 26 last Sunday.
"Phillip's spirit, which is now part of our game forever, will act as a custodian of the sport we all love. We must listen to it," he said, struggling to contain his emotions.
"We must cherish it. We must learn from it. We must dig in and get through to tea. And we must play on.
"So rest in peace my little brother. I will see you out in the middle."
Some 1,000 mourners, mostly locals with a smattering of luminaries including Prime Minister Tony Abbott, dabbed away tears and perspiration in the baking heat of the school hall with thousands more watching on screens in the sunshine outside.
Australian greats of the game such as Shane Warne, Ricky Ponting and Glenn McGrath were in attendance, while Richard Hadlee, Brian Lara and India captain Virat Kohli represented the wider cricket world.
The service was broadcast live on international television news networks and shown on big screens in Australia's major cities, including at the Sydney Cricket Ground where Hughes suffered the fatal injury during a state match last Tuesday.
BAT TRIBUTES
Hughes was batting for a recall to the Australia side for the opening match in the test series against India -- since rescheduled -- when he suffered the injury that killed him.
The number 63, the runs Hughes had accumulated when he was struck by the ball, has become inextricably linked with the tragedy, as has 408, a reference to him becoming the 408th man to play test cricket for Australia in 2009.
Most of all though, it is the viral campaign to get people to place cricket bats in tribute outside homes, workplaces and at sports grounds that has become the most common manifestation of the outpouring of grief around the world.
That was reflected by Hughes's own bat, stood up against the coffin throughout the service, which concluded with "Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me", the song Elton John dedicated to Hughes when he played it in a concert in Munich last week.
Clarke and fellow cricketers Aaron Finch and Tom Cooper joined Hughes's father and brother among the pallbearers who delivered the coffin to the hearse, which then set off in a procession through the town.

China and Turkey fall behind in global corruption index

Beijing
(The Berlin-based organisation…)
BERLIN: Turkey and China's rating on perceived corruption has fallen steeply, according to Transparency International (TI), and the global watchdog called for closer international cooperation to root out graft and abuses of power.
Transparency International issues an annual report measuring perceptions of graft rather than actual levels given the secrecy surrounding most corrupt dealings. It uses a scale where 100 stands for the most clean and 0 for the most corrupt.
The Berlin-based organisation published its 2014 Corruption Perceptions Index of 175 countries on Wednesday and it showed Turkey's record had worsened the most precipitously in 2014, dropping by five points to 45.
A corruption scandal broke out in Turkey in late December last year, the worst since the Islamist-rooted AK Party came to power more than a decade ago
China's rating fell by four points to 36, even though the Beijing Communist government has launched a concerted campaign to weed out venal officials, the TI report said.
Beijing's low score matched a poor performance by Chinese companies in the watchdog's recent report on corporate disclosure practice.
"Grand corruption in big economies not only blocks basic human rights for the poorest but also creates governance problems and instability," TI Chairman Jose Ugaz said in a statement in the report.
It urged states ranked at the bottom of the index to take radical anti-graft steps in their people's interest. "Countries at the top of the index should make sure they don't export corrupt practices to underdeveloped countries," Ugaz said.
Corruption undermines economic growth and efforts to stop graft tend to fade when even high level officials abuse their power to embezzle public funds for personal gain, he said.
More than two thirds of the 175 countries in the index scored below 50 with Somalia, North Korea, Sudan, Afghanistan and South Sudan once again at the bottom.
The top performer was again Denmark with 92 points, a rise of one from last year, and New Zealand, Finland, Sweden and Norway again rounded out the top five. For a factbox on the index click on
Ukraine (26 points) remained the European country with the highest perceived level of graft. Italy, Greece and Romania (43) jointly scored the worst among the European Union member states.
TI also urged the EU, United States and G20 countries to follow Denmark's lead and create a public register that includes beneficial ownership information for all incorporated companies.

Live: Final farewell for Phillip Hughes  tearful Clarke pays tribute at funeral serviceFinal farewell to Phillip Hughes, Clarke pays poignant tribute
AFP

Cricketing greats bid an emotional farewell to Phillip Hughes at a funeral service in his home town Wednesday, as Australia stopped to remember the batsman whose death from a freak injury sent shockwaves through the sport.
A lone cricket bat rested against the coffin at a packed service in his former high school hall in Macksville on the New South Wales coast in front of his heartbroken parents, family and friends and a shattered Australian Test team.
"Taken from the game, his family and loved ones at the age of just 25, left a mark on our game that needs no embellishment," tearful captain Michael Clarke told the funeral. "I don't know about you but I keep looking for him."
Hughes, who had played 26 Tests and was on the cusp of a recall, died from bleeding on the brain last Thursday after being hit on the base of the skull by a rising ball at the Sydney Cricket Ground during a domestic match.
His tragic death stunned Australia, where cricket is considered the national game, and prompted a rescheduling of the upcoming India Test series, while fans around the world placed bats outside their front doors as a mark of respect.
Clarke said he walked to the middle of the SCG on Thursday night: "Those same blades of grass beneath my feet where he and I and so many of his mates here today have built partnerships, taken chances and lived out the dreams we painted in our heads as boys.
"I stood there at the wicket, I knelt down and touched the grass, I swear he was with me... Telling me we just needed to dig in and get through to tea," he added.
 
'We must play on'
 
Clarke said the tributes offered from sports stars and fans across the globe had sustained him, from a little girl holding a candle in tribute, to masters of the game such as Sachin Tendulkar expressing sorrow.
"This is what makes our game the greatest game in the world. We must dig in and get through to tea. And we must play on," he added.
"So rest in peace my little brother. I will see you out in the middle."
In Hughes' small hometown of Macksville, on Australia's east coast, tributes to the opening batsman hung in shop windows, while ribbons in the green and gold colours of the Australian Test team adorned telephone poles.
Macksville itself, with a population of just 2,500, welcomed greats such as Shane Warne, Brian Lara, Glenn McGrath, Virat Kohli and Hughes' first Test skipper Ricky Ponting.
Sean Abbott, the young man who bowled the fast ball which struck Hughes, also attended supported by his parents, as did Prime Minister Tony Abbott.
Tony Abbott said there had been profound grief, in part because to "be felled by a hard but fair ball in the centre of the SCG at your most exuberant, it just doesn't seem right or natural".
 
'Spirit of cricket'
Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland said over the past week the nation and the sporting world had reeled in shock.
"Yet even within that profound sense of loss the spirit of cricket has shone through the darkness," he told the gathering.
Hughes' parents Greg and Virginia and siblings invited the whole town to the service at Macksville High School, where about 1,000 crammed into the hall and hundreds more watched on screens in overflow areas.
The funeral was a huge event in Macksville, with shops closing and residents in mourning. Just outside town, one business created a huge tribute using three cherry pickers as cricket stumps and putting Hughes' Test number 408 across them.
At Hughes's old primary school, St Patrick's, dozens of bats lined the front fence, many bearing messages remembering the hugely popular opener who was not out on 63 when he was struck.
As a summer storm threatened after a hot day, hundreds walked along the street behind the hearse carrying Hughes's coffin, some nodding their heads, others applauding, out of respect for the cricketer.
Hughes died after his vertebral artery split when hit by the ball, leading to massive bleeding in his brain.

Watch the interview of Amit Gupta of ICICI Direct with Latha Venkatesh & Sonia Shenoy on CNBC-TV18, in which he shared his reading and outlook on market and specific stocks.
Below is the verbatim transcript of Amit Gupta's interview with CNBC-TV18
Cement stocks have remained subdued for the last couple of series but ACC  has been hovering around the 2012 highs of around Rs 1530-1540. It came down by almost Rs 100, so there was clearly short addition in the stock but in the last two three months we have seen that whenever it comes down to Rs 1400-1380 kind of levels, there is always a bounce back and it moves towards Rs 1550-1560 kind of level.
Once it is bouncing again from the lower band, it is again an opportunity for the long traders to enter into the stock. Even on declines if it comes down to Rs 1450-1460 kind of level, you initiate your long positions, keep your stoploss around Rs 1400 which has been a very good
base now for the stock and look for the higher band of Rs 1550-1560 on the higher side.
Almost three-four months have gone off in this particular consolidation, so now eventually it will go for a breakout afterwards.
There is some buying coming back into the consumer stocks whether you look at Hindustan
Unilever, Titan Company  or Havells India , I think Godrej Industries  has remained a laggard for quite sometime now. It has been a total underperformer in the market but recently we have seen initial signs of some movement starting in the stock. If you look at the delivery
pickup, it has been really good in the last couple of weeks. If you see the volumes which have picked up at Rs 280, now Rs 280 has been a very good level because if you draw a trend line from 2009 in the stock, that comes at Rs 280. It has not breached that trend line in the last five-six years.
At these levels if you look at the short covering, yesterday also there was little bit short covering, it has already panned out, so above Rs 291 because that was the level where very high volumes were seen on the higher side, there is a possibility that the stock may move
towards Rs 315-320 kind of levels.
Overall it is at a good base, it has already spent one and half months over here and because market is likely to consolidate, I think among these kind of stocks also they may start participating. So you can punt on this for another Rs 20-30 upside.

United Spirits stock brushes aside shareholder alarmDirect equity set to top FDs as biggest asset class in FY15: Report
The United Spirits scrip slipped over 8% in early morning trade on Monday before recovering to end the session 0.5% lower than Friday’s close. While most of the institutional shareholders that FE spoke to said they had not sold shares, they confirmed they had voted against several resolutions put to vote at the extra ordinary general meeting (EGM) on Friday. Of the 12 resolutions put to vote nine were not passed. Some fund managers said they voted against the resolutions as they believed these would  favour Vijay Mallya and put unnecessary financial burden on the Diageo-controlled United Spirits.
The fall in stock price, dealers said, may have been the result of profit-taking.
As per disclosures on the exchanges, institutional shareholders were instrumental in deciding the fate of the resolutions at the EGM. Of the 4.04 crore shares held by the institutions — both domestic and foreign — 38.86% of votes were polled, while of the 1.93 crore shares held by non-institutional shareholders, including HNIs and retail investors, 0.62% of votes were polled.
Among the special resolutions proposed at the EGM, a property maintenance services agreement with Kingfisher Finvest was disapproved as 77.17% of the votes were against the resolution. A fund manager speaking on conditions of anonymity said, “The loan arrangements and property maintenance services arrangements with other companies don’t make sense. We feel these transactions would put unnecessary financial burden on United Spirits.”
As per the latest annual report, the company paid R14 crore to Kingfisher Finvest towards ‘property maintenance fees’ in FY14. Among other resolutions, a loan arrangement with United Breweires (Holdings) was also disapproved.
Special resolutions were proposed for sponsorship agreement with United Racing and Bloodstock Breeders (URBB) and United Mohun Bagan Football Team. Both the resolutions were shot down.
Another fund manager said that while there was some uncertainty on the stock, the company was expected to do well in the long term.
Diageo holds 54.78% in United Spirits through its wholly-owned subsidiary Relay BV after it bought an additional 26% from public shareholders for R11,488 crore in July.

Panel recommends Centre to consult states over B desh land swapParliament's Standing Committee on External Affairs recommends Centre to consult states over Bangladesh land swap

(Due to lack of access to these…)
NEW DELHI: Parliament's Standing Committee on External Affairs , which submitted its report on the Land Boundary Agreement Bill on exchange of enclaves with Bangladesh, has recommended that the Centre should have closer consultations with the concerned state governments but the differences between BJP and TMC that governs West Bengal indicate that the Constitution Amendment may have to be passed without the nod of the Mamata Banerjee-led dispensation.
The Standing Committee headed by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor submitted its report to both Houses of Parliament on Monday. The document urges the Centre to pass The Constitution (One Hundred and Nineteenth Amendment) Bill, 2013, soon as the land boundary dispute with Bangladesh - unresolved since 1974 - is forcing people living in this area to lead a miserable life.
Due to lack of access to these areas by the law and order enforcement agencies and weak property rights, certain enclaves have become the "hotbed of criminal activities", the report states.
BJP was opposed to the land boundary agreement while it was in opposition but has changed its opinion after coming to power in May. Party sources said BJP's Assam unit is still opposed to the agreement on the grounds that India will cede more territory to Bangladesh in the land swap.
TMC too is still against the exchange of enclaves. Since the proposed legislation - under which 111 Indian enclaves in Bangladesh and 51 Bangladesh enclaves in India will be exchanged - is a constitutional amendment, it would have to be ratified by half of the state assemblies.
As per the report, all Bangladeshi enclaves are located in the district of Cooch Behar in West Bengal and all Indian enclaves are located in four Bangladeshi districts of Panchagarh, Lalmonirhat, Kurigram and Nilphamari which are close to the border with West Bengal.
While the Standing Committee has observed in its report that "closer consultations at the highest political level between central government and state government would have been desirable," it further suggests to the government to "effectively coordinate with them (state governments concerned) on all matters and resolve the lacuna related to actual implementation of the Accord on the ground".
Though the land swap can be done even if the West Bengal government is not in agreement provided Parliament passes the Bill and half (15) the states give their nod, not having the Mamata Banerjee government on board would create a peculiar situation.

Let s add value to our trade agreementsSearch for:
Let’s add value to our trade agreements
5
By Anjali Tandon
The underlying purpose of trade agreements is to obtain access to resources and markets that help in increasing the value and volume of trade. This adds to the domestic income. Traditionally, trade agreements are evaluated for their trade creation and diversion effects among the member countries based on the trade values. However, national earnings are not truly reflected through values of trade.
This is because a country may be earning high on exports of a product, but its net earnings from the product may be low due to large imports of related inputs and a low value added component in the finally exported product. Which is why it becomes important to consider the value-added component of the gains in trade.
For India, the experience with free trade agreements has been mixed. Assessment of their impact is impaired either due to data constraints or due to the inability to evaluate effect of the counter factual. Already in the past, trade and investment agreements widened their horizon beyond trade in goods. Issues relating to competition are increasingly emphasised by using the rules of origin (RoO) instrument of trade policy.
The RoO is used to determine the country of origin based on criteria such as last substantial transformation and the value added (VA). The value added essentially refers to the income after reducing the cost of inputs from the value of output. The RoO is required to handle issues related to anti-dumping, completion, and quotas besides the data necessary to compile trade statistics.
Importance of the RoO has increased as global supply chains are increasingly spliced and a specific product can travel, transit and transform substantially before reaching the point of ultimate consumption. For instance, the automobile supply chain consists of design, raw material (steel, glass), components (tyres, air bags and windshields), assembly, marketing and distribution. Each of these has various levels of value added and can be dispersed across countries. And yet, trade agreements do not consider these consequences while assessing the prospects. This, despite the RoO concept being in place for a while now.
The value-addition structure of Indian exports is aligned with the world exports with 24% of the value due to foreign inputs and 76% due to domestic production. Further, 42% of the domestic value added is consumed at the first export destination while another 34% is consumed at the second destination.
By comparison, for China, foreign inputs account for 33% of total exports. Of the 67% domestically-produced component, only 25% is consumed at the immediate export destination while 41% is consumed after the first transit. This underscores China’s presence in processing and assembly trade. So a country’s export competitiveness could be on the comparative strength of its intermediate imports and the net national earnings may not be as large despite high value of exports. Under such circumstances, exports tend to misrepresent the net gains and incomes.
Expanding global supply chains increasingly challenge the traditional income measures based on export values. The value-added assessment of trade potential is imperative if India plans to effectively generate income through trade expansion by engagement in trade agreements.

Nomura says India s inflation at post-financial crisis lows; positive on stock marketsDirect equity set to top FDs as biggest asset class in FY15: Report
Japanese brokerage Nomura today said inflation levels in India are close to post global financial crisis lows, and retained its positive stance on the country’s stock market.
According to the global financial services major, the national accounts reveal that inflation rates across sectors in the country are close to post-GFC (global financial crisis) lows.
“Inflation across aggregate sectors is close to post-GFC lows; we reiterate our positive stance on the market and remain OW (overweight) on financials,” Nomura said in a research note.
The headline retail and wholesale inflation figures since July coincided with the collapse of global commodity prices, led by crude oil.
Among other factors that led to the decline in headline retail inflation include significant fall in global agricultural commodity prices and strong base effects.
According to official figure, wholesale inflation came down to a five-year low at 1.77 per cent in October while retail inflation hit a record low of 5.52 per cent in the same month.
“We maintain our positive view on the market and overweight stance on financials,” Nomura said, adding that the Sensex is trading at around 7 per cent premium to its 5-year average which “we think is not expensive”.
In August, Nomura had raised its BSE Sensex target to 30,310 for August 2015.
Stock markets have seen significant gains in 2014 and the BSE benchmark sensitive index (Sensex) has gained 7,268.23 points or 34.33 per cent so far this year.
The 30-share Sensex was trading 0.41 per cent down at 28,441.16 in the afternoon as the Reserve Bank did not cut the key interest rate, maintaining status quo at the monetary policy review today.

Facebook signs up IIT graduates for Rs 1.55 crore; companies offer more jobs this placement season

Esop
(In the first 20 hours, online…)
MUMBAI: A spectacular initial burst — at least 15-20% more jobs, 10-20% higher average salaries and 30% increase in global offers — set the pace for this year's placement season at Indian Institutes of Technology which kicked off on Monday.
Sources from eight campuses that ET spoke to said hiring and salaries will shoot up this year, after a relatively slow 3-4 years.
In the first 20 hours, online social networking giant Facebook ruled the roost with a Rs 1.55 crore ($250,000) salary offer including bonus and ESOPs for a US posting.
This is the probably the highest ever offer across IITs in recent years.
Facebook made the offer for software engineer profiles based out of California to three students at IIT Kharagpur and to an unknown number at IIT-Bombay, sources at the two institutes revealed. The company did not respond to an email sent by ET.
Overall, big-ticket offers were back with a bang as other top paymasters, according to campus sources, included Samsung - $150,000 (Rs 93 lakh), Microsoft -$129,000 (Rs 80 lakh), Oracle - $125,000 plus Esops (Rs 78 lakh plus Esops), Google - $125,000 (Rs 78 lakh) and Visa -$140,000 (Rs 87 lakh).
At IIT-BHU, Varanasi, the top package from a multinational was Rs 77.5 lakh ($100,000 base salary, $15,000 sign-on bonus and $10,000 relocation and stock options), an over 19% jump over the top offer last year. At IIT-Kanpur, it went up over 36% from $110,000 last year to $150,000 this time.
"If this momentum continues, we will place 1,200 students in the first 20 days compared to 1,000 last year," a placement team member of IIT-Kharagpur said. Across campuses, international offers saw a boom compared to last year. Oracle, for instance, said that it is hiring for 15 overseas roles this year, compared to 13 last time. Students will join the American multinational computer technology corporation in product development roles across its hardware, software or industry-specific based groups. Cisco Systems and Visa Inc offered overseas roles for the first time.
International offers will shoot up by 30%, agreed a placement source at IIT Kanpur.
More offers --from the likes of ServiceNow ($90,000) and Epic Systems ($90,000) - are in the offing, he said.
Other first day recruiters across the 16 IITs included the likes of Goldman Sachs, HUL, ITC, Credit Suisse, McKinsey & Co and BCG. IIT-Bombay, which on student demand, has moved up some core engineering companies to premium slots, had GE, Airbus and Qualcomm among others, vying with traditional first-day recruiters for the first time.
Tower Research with Rs 44 lakh for an international role and WorldQuant with Rs 42 lakh for a domestic profile were among prominent recruiters at campuses such as IIT-Kanpur, placement sources revealed. Goldman Sachs offered packages of Rs 26 lakh and Credit Suisse around Rs 15-18 lakh while Samsung offered the most for its Korea posting.
Final placements at the IITs start on December 1 and are completed in two phases.
A majority of the recruiters come in the first few weeks of December while the subsequent phase starts in January.
The highest-paying and most-in-demand companies are typically slotted for the first few days of placements.
At IIT-Kharagpur, Facebook has made the top offer while Google, Microsoft and Cisco also competed for the best talent.
Oilfield services company Baker Hughes, ITC (Rs 18 lakh approx), Schlumberger, Cairn India, Shell were among those recruiting for domestic roles. Microsoft paid around Rs 20 lakh for the India profiles. Xerox, the global printer manufacturer picked up students for 'budding scientist' profiles, said placement sources.
"The placements have been very good so far and from midnight to 6 am on Monday (1st day slot), 49 offers were rolled out, out of which 8 were international.
Around 31 companies are expected on the first day," Natesan Srinivasan, faculty in-charge, training & placement for IIT-Guwahati said A statement from IIT-Madras said the highest offer was $129,500 while the highest domestic salary was Rs 30 lakh. Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, Samsung R&D and Xerox were among the companies who visited. The institute said it received 17 offers in the graveyard session (midnight to 6am) and another 64 in the forenoon one (6am to noon).
The placement season will continue till March-April, though a bulk of offers would roll out over the next three weeks.

Railway jobs are open for all; not reserved for any regionJobs

NEW DELHI: Jobs in railways are open to all eligible citizens of India and there is no specific policy for employment of people of a specific region or terrain, Lok Sabha was informed today.
"A railway line in any area is an engine of growth and it generates large quantum of direct and indirect employment which is not possible to quantify. Such employment is not created in terms of a particular project," Minister for Railways Manoj Sinha said during Question Hour.
He said the Railway Ministry has sanctioned 55 new lines, nine gauge conversions and 128 doubling projects since 2009. Out of these 10 doubling projects have been completed so far.
Sinha said the Railways have numerous projects worth Rs 2,58,00,000 crore remained incomplete and steps are being taken to accelerate them.

GlaxoSmithKline to axe US jobs as part of $1.6 billion cost cutsasthma
(Staff in the US, where GSK has…)
LONDON: GlaxoSmithKline will this week inform US staff of hundreds of job cuts in its biggest market as the drugmaker starts implementing a major cost-saving programme, sources familiar with the matter said on Sunday.
Britain's top drugmaker announced at third-quarter results on Oct. 22 that the new restructuring scheme would save 1 billion pounds ($1.56 billion) in annual costs over three years, but it has yet to tell employees where the axe will fall.
Staff in the United States, where GSK has been struggling with falling sales of respiratory drugs, will be briefed on the changes on Wednesday by the company's head of North American pharmaceuticals Deirdre Connelly, the sources said.
A GSK spokesman declined to go into details but said the aim of the restructuring programme was to improve performance by reducing complexity and establishing a smaller, more focused and lower-cost organization.
"Each business unit is currently deciding how to respond to this challenge. When we do have proposals, we will first share those with our employees," he said in an e-mailed statement.
Respiratory medicine has traditionally been GSK's strongest business and Advair - an inhaled therapy for asthma and chronic lung disease - is its biggest seller. But Advair sales are now tumbling the United States, while new lung drugs Breo and Anoro are proving slow to take off.
Advair has been hit by competition from rivals and an increasing trend by US health insurers to use hardball tactics to get drugmakers to cut prices for older products.
French drugmaker Sanofi has reported similar pressures from US insurers in the diabetes market.
US insurers, who themselves are under pressure to keep premiums in check, are pushing back particularly hard on prices for medicines in areas like diabetes and respiratory diseases where there are multiple options for doctors and patients.
The revamped GSK operation in the United States is designed to defend the company's margins in this tough environment. The changes will also take into account the movement of some pharmaceuticals staff as a result of a complex asset swap deal with Switzerland's Novartis , which is taking over GSK's oncology business.

Spices Board plan to tap potential of north-eastern region(At present, the cultivation…)
By Krishnakumar PK
KOCHI: Hot and pungent Naga chillies and bird's eye chillies, high curcumin bearing Lakadong turmeric, Nadia ginger and large cardamom could become household names in the country in the next few years with their production all set to increase, thanks to the initiative by the Spices Board to tap the potential of the landlocked region.
At present, the cultivation of these spices is mostly confined to the Northeastern region and people in other parts of the country are not much aware of it. For instance, not many know that Naga chillies, cultivated in Nagaland , hold the Guinness record for being the hottest chillies. Similarly, Lakadong turmeric is grown in Meghalaya and large cardamom in Sikkim.
Spices Board has earmarked Rs 57.50 crore in the 12th Plan for turning the region into a major hub of organic farming of spices, a rise of nearly 68% from the previous plan period. Since the spices are grown in the traditional way, the region has become organic by default and the Board intends to exploit the advantage to the fullest.
"There is good demand for spices in the organic form. The Board proposes to establish seeds banks and increase the supply of planting materials for export-oriented varieties like Lakadong turmeric and Nadia ginger. It will offer 50% of the planting material per hectare as subsidy," said A Jayathilak, chairman of Spices Board.
Organic farm certification assistance, setting up of organic value-addition units, and formation of spice producers' societies are some of the works planned by the Board to promote the cultivation of organic spices. The Board has also signed an agreement with the state horticulture department of Arunachal Pradesh for developing the spices.
Besides, auction centres for large cardamom in Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh are also being considered. Another move is to set up spices parks, providing common processing facilities in Meghalaya and Manipur.
"It is a good move as the land is virgin and the demand for spices is increasing. There is a need to step up the production of both organic and conventional spices to bridge the gap between demand and supply. Whatever is produced is getting consumed," said Shailesh Shah, director at major spice exporting firm Jabs International.
The traditional growth centres of spices are southern states, Gujarat and Rajasthan, though it is cultivated in other states too. Uttar Pradesh is a major mint producer. Consequently, most of the processing units are located in these places. "It would be difficult to transport spices to other parts of the country. Eventually, we will have to start production units in the Northeastern states," said Sanjaya Mariwala, MD of Kancor Ingredients, a value-added spices manufacturer.
Once the production increases, then Kolkata port could become a major export hub, according to Shah. "Exports of chilli have now almost shifted to Chennai port from Mumbai as Malaysia, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have become the main buyers," he added. Last year, India exported 8,17,250 tonne spices worth Rs 13,735 crore.

(Spices exports grew by 12…)
NEW DELHI: Spices exports rose by 9 per cent in the first six months of this fiscal in value terms to Rs 6,963 crore.
According to Spices Board data, exports stood at Rs 6,364.64 crore in the year-ago period.
In volume terms, spices exports grew by 12 per cent to 4,21,570 tonnes during April-September period of this fiscal as against 3,76,584 tonnes in the corresponding period of the previous year.
"Spices exports have grown by 12 per cent in volume terms and 9 per cent in value terms during the first six months of this fiscal," Spices Board Chairman A Jayathilak told.
Chilli, mint products, cumin, spice oils & oleoresins, pepper , turmeric , coriander , curry powder/paste and fenugreek contributed substantially to the overall spices exports, he added.
Chilli exports stood at 1,61,000 tonnes worth Rs 1,547.30 crore during the period. The exports were up by 17 per cent in quantity and 23 per cent in value.
Exports of mint and mint products (mint oils, menthol and menthol crystals) stood at 13,300 tonnes worth Rs 1,463.25 crore. Cumin exports stood at 87,500 tonnes that earned a foreign exchange of Rs 977.5 crore.
Jayathilak noted that Spices Board has got the "Niryat Bandhu" award, set up by industry body FIEO.
Spices Board has a mandate to promote exports of 52 spices in any form, including curry powder , oils, oleoresins and other spice mixes, where spice content is predominant.
Besides exports development of 52 spices, the board also looks after production of cardamom (small & large).

Inflation at multi-year lows but RBI s Rajan didn t cut rates. Here s whyindian economy
(With economic recovery…)
NEW DELHI: RBI Governor Rahuram Rajan disappointed analysts by not cutting key rates in the central bank's monetary policy review. Despite Consumer price Index (CPI) inflation plunging to multi-year lows, Rajan said that it was premature for the RBI to change policy stance.
What held the RBI Governor from cutting key policy rates? With economic recovery still being sluggish and inflation coming down drastically, Rajan is of the opinion that the central bank should adopt a wait-and-watch policy.
RBI feels that there is still some uncertainty about the evolution of base effects in inflation, the strength of the on-going disinflationary impulses, the pace of change of the public's inflationary expectations, as well as the success of the government's efforts to hit deficit targets.
"A change in the monetary policy stance at the current juncture is premature. However, if the current inflation momentum and changes in inflationary expectations continue, and fiscal developments are encouraging, a change in the monetary policy stance is likely early next year, including outside the policy review cycle," the bank said.
RBI has also revised down its forecast for CPI inflation to 6% for March 2015. "Risks from imported inflation appear to be retreating, given the softening of international commodity prices, especially crude, and reasonable stability in the foreign exchange market," RBI elaborated.
Talking about inflation, the Governor admitted that headline inflation has been receding steadily and current readings are below the January 2015 target of 8% as well as the January 2016 target of 6%. "The inflation reading for November - which will become available by mid-December - is expected to show a further softening. Thereafter, however, the favourable base effect that is driving down headline inflation will likely dissipate and inflation for December may well rise above current levels," Rajan said.
Monsoon uncertainty and its full impact on prices, is yet another factor that seems to have held back Rajan from easing his stance. "The full outcome of the north-east monsoon will determine the intensity of price pressures relating to cereals, oilseeds and pulses, but it is reasonable to expect some firming up of these prices in view of the monsoon's performance so far and the shortfall estimated for kharif production," he said.
According to RBI, weak demand and rapid pace of recent disinflation are factors supporting monetary accommodation. "However, the weak transmission by banks of the recent fall in money market rates into lending rates suggests monetary policy shifts will primarily have signaling effects for a while," the bank said.
"Nevertheless, these signalling effects are likely to be large because the Reserve Bank has repeatedly indicated that once the monetary policy stance shifts, subsequent policy actions will be consistent with the changed stance," it added.
CPI showed retail inflation slowed further to 5.52% in October, another low on the gauge that was launched in 2011, because of softer food and fuel prices.

Exploring the Little India in SingaporeWritten by Sandip Hor |
Posted: December 2, 2014 1:21 pm | Updated: December 2, 2014 1:25 pm
It’s a normal weekday afternoon in Singapore. I am on my way from the airport to the hotel. As we pass through the mega city’s avant-garde precincts and manoeuvre into Serangoon Road, it appear like stepping into another world where imaginably time has stopped. The buildings flanking the thoroughfare, the merchandise on display in the shops, the people crowding the quarter, the billboards and posters greeting eyes and the entire atmosphere doesn’t match up with rest of Singapore, but surely present a vibrant character.
“We are in Little India Sir, here you will possibly get to drink Mango Lassi instead of Singapore Sling”, tells Lee my taxi driver excitedly while dropping me at the foyer of the newly opened One Farrer Hotel and Spa.
One Farrer Hotel and Spa (Source: Sandip Hor)
There are few other sleeping nests in the locale, but this urban resort has been designed for the discerning travellers by amalgamating innovative hospitality offerings with technology enabled contemporary chic accommodation styles. “We are ready to welcome patrons from India to make them feel at home away from home” says an executive management staff from the hotel.
The “home away from home” feeling is unmistakable, the moment I storm outside. People on the streets are largely like me, many attired in their traditional costumes such as saris and dhotis. The air is filled with aroma of curries and blended with the fragrance of flowers and burning incense sticks.

An avoidable controversy
Sanskrit
The Union government’s attempt to replace German with Sanskrit as the third language taught in Kendriya Vidyalayas for Classes VI to VIII in the middle of an academic year is oblivious to the interests of students as also to the need to ensure credibility in dealings with other nations. Its explanation is that a memorandum of understanding signed between the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) under the previous regime with the Goethe Institut/Max Mueller Bhavan — to teach German as a third language — is illegal and violative of the National Education Policy. Several school systems in the country include foreign languages such as French and German as even a second language, and so far no one has ever questioned their legality. In this case, German was only one of the options for the third language offered by the KVS and the MoU was never intended to make it compulsory. The fact that over 70,000 students across 500 schools opted for it speaks volumes about the preference among students and parents to learn a foreign language to boost their career prospects. Student preference for Sanskrit as a third language remains unclear. The HRD Ministry seems insensitive to the impact of its decision so late in the academic year on students who have taken up the language. It is obvious that the present regime’s eagerness to demonstrate its commitment to Sanskrit overrides the interests of students, as well as the notion of sanctity of agreements reached with institutions backed by foreign states.
The Supreme Court has questioned the haste with which Sanskrit is sought to be introduced in the middle of an academic year. The government’s claim that it will ensure that students are not put undue stress by adopting an entry level syllabus and marking system shows that its keenness to promote Sanskrit is mere tokenism. The court seems to have endorsed the policy of introducing the learning of Sanskrit, described as ‘the mother of many languages’, as a third language, but only wants the decision to be implemented from the next academic year. To be fair, the November 11, 2014, office memorandum replacing German says students can learn either Sanskrit or any other ‘modern Indian language’ as third language. German will be relegated to the non-serious ‘hobby class’. The moot question, however, is whether at all Sanskrit should be counterpoised against German when there should be a place for both the languages, with students being allowed to choose Sanskrit or another modern Indian or European language. Such counterpoising is all the more ironic considering that German academia has had a long tradition of scholarship in Sanskrit and Indian studies.

See rate cut post Budget; better credit growth in 2015: SBIAfter the dovish comments by the Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan Tuesday, State Bank of India , India’s largest public sector lender, expects the central bank to cut rates post Budget next year.
According to SBI Chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya, since the governor has set the deadline of 6 percent inflation by March 2015, post Budget seems to be the right time for a rate cut.
She expects the central bank to undergo a series of rate cuts in 2015, starting with at least a 50 bps cut in March.
Going ahead, Bhattacharya expects better credit growth in 2015. She believes situation will be much better in 2015 (than today) with rate cycle turning next year on the back of execution of large projects, government receiving cash from coal allocation, spectrum auction etc.  
Below is verbatim transcript of the interview:
 
Q: What is your assessment of the RBI policy today?
A: The tone is very dovish. I am quite hopeful and the governor has also left the window open for action outside the policy. Further, if you look at the fan charts that have been put out, the earlier range in June 2014 was between 8 and 11 percent. Currently, they are showing a range of 4.2-6 percent and so, even in their estimation, the disinflationary trends are quite well entrenched.
We have also been seeing how the RBI rates have approximated the prices of crude and whenever crude price comes down, the rates also come down. Overall, we are looking at sometime early next year with the rate cycle turning.
Q: By when do you think the first rate cut could come thorough, there were some who were off the camp that it could be as early as February? You do expect it to be early next year but could it possibly be delayed to even post the Budget? Your sense on how much and by when could be the first rate cut?
A: Post Budget is probably the best time that we are looking at. If he has put 6 percent as the target for March then post Budget seems to be the right time.
Q: Do you think the quantum of the rate cuts could possibly be restricted in 2015 because one of the things that were mentioned in the press conference that the government too has accepted or will possibly accept is that 4 percent consumer price index (CPI) or inflation target which will go beyond January 2016. So, in order to actually focus your energy on that do you think rate cuts would be restricted in 2015?
A: I don’t really know but he mentioned that there will be series of rate cuts and to that extent, how much will exactly go down during the next year is difficult to guess at this point in time.
Things will not be as difficult as it they seem to be right now and therefore, looking at everything it would not be restricted to a very small number. This is because even today, the Commercial paper (CP) markets are operating and are well below base rates. Therefore, the expectation is that when he does come in he should come in with at least 50 basis points now.
Q: What is the credit growth looking like right now for SBI as well as for the industry as a whole? When do you think some amount of lending rate cut can come through?
A: Credit growth is picking up. It is better than what it was the last time I spoke to you all and hopefully, it will resume speed in last quarter.
Regarding lending rate cuts, it will be sometime towards the end of the first quarter, again difficult for me to say because we still haven’t had an asset-liability committee (ALCO) where we need to talk about it and so, I am really not telling you anything regarding my own bank.
However, overall for the industry the feeling is that the deposit rates need to come down. We led the deposit rate cut a while back and now few bigger banks like HDFC cut its rates about three weeks back and so, some of the bigger banks are now beginning to cut on their deposit rates.
As and when that gets entrenched and the deposit rates trend downwards you can also see some kind of result in cuts in the base rates.
Having said that, we could see compression of spreads on various kinds of lending’s and not necessarily straight away a base rate cut. So, we have to watch out for whatever is happening in respect of this spreads, in fact number of bands have reduced spread on various types of products. So, though you have not noticed a base rate cut actually speaking lending has become a little cheaper.
Q: Could you give us a sense for 2015, what would credit growth possibly look like in terms of growth as compared to this year?
A: Credit growth in 2015 will definitely be better especially the later half of 2015 by which time you would definitely be able to see projects coming online. As you can see once the coal auctions go there will be some amount of money that will be taken out there.
In respect of the telecom spectrum auction again some amount of money will definitely be used. So 2015 the credit growth will definitely be better than what we have seen in 2014.
Q: One of the things that was announced during the RBI press conference today as opposed to what was out in the PDF was the 5/25 restructuring will possibly be extended to existing projects as opposed to new projects. We have already spoken to Pradeep Kumar of SBI on this but I wanted your view on this as well as the possibility of hiking equity participation of banks in restructured projects to beyond 10 percent that is the current limit.
A: Both of these are very positive for banks and both will be very good. This is because I really don’t understand why a project, if it is new, should be given the advantage of repaying over a longer period of time whereas the existing project should not be given the same facility, they should be on the same level platform.
To that extent, it should be good for the banks, they would be able to refinance many loans where projects are working and cash flows are seen.
In respect of converting debt-to-equity this is also required in respect of those projects where we are sure of the viability and where banks can actually have a piece of the upside when the projects actually turnaround.
Also, this would improve viability because if you have too much of debt and not enough equity then it creates leverage and a pressure for servicing of the debt which sometimes impacts the viability of the project. Hence, both these things are very positive for banks.
Q: This is regarding recapitalisation plan by the government with regards to public sector undertaking (PSU) banks, have you heard anything in terms of the plans by the finance ministry as well as any progress in terms of a possible merger between subsidiary banks and SBI?
A: Regarding the subsidiary banks and SBI we are still working on it. We have not yet gone to the government with anything.
Regarding capitalization, I know as much as you and that too from the media itself. We have been seeing reports where finance ministry and the finance minister himself have said that they are looking at diluting their stake to 52 percent and we are expecting that some action will happen on that. Once that is through and we get that approval we will be looking at ways and means as to how to raise equity.
SBI stock price
On December 10, 2014, State Bank of India closed at Rs 295.90, down Rs 14.45, or 4.66 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 2977.85 and the 52-week low was Rs 291.05.
The company's trailing 12-month (TTM) EPS was at Rs 15.70 per share as per the quarter ended September 2014. The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was 18.85. The latest book value of the company is Rs 158.43 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company is 1.87.

PUNE: India plans to introduce a system to allow international consumers of Indian mangoes to trace back the fruit to its farm of origin through the internet as part of its efforts to persuade the European Union to lift ban on Indian mangoes.
Government agencies are working to put in place 'Mangonet' — an online traceability system that will register mango growers and exporters and enable importers and supermarkets in the European Union (EU) to check complete details of their shipments — on the lines of the successful 'Grapenet'.
"The success of Grapenet has encouraged us to replicate the system in mangoes," said Sudhanshu, deputy general manager of Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority.
The EU had imposed a temporary ban on Alphonso mangoes and four vegetables from India from May 1, stating that it had found fruit fly infestation in the fruit.
This impacted exports to the United Kingdom (UK), the second largest export market for Indian mangoes after the UAE. Following the ban, Maharashtra, the largest exporter of mangoes in the country, started using HortiSAP, an IT-based pest surveillance system extensively for mangoes.
An EU audit committee visited export facilities in India two months ago, following which, the government agencies and exporters are hopeful that the ban would be lifted next year.
"The EU audit committee has seen the sea change in our set up," said Sudhanshu. Maharashtra's horticulture department has recruited about 70 to 80 agricultural graduates to monitor mango orchards in eight mango-exporting districts in the state for early detection of any pest/disease incidence. They get online advisories from the National Centre for Integrated Pest Management in New Delhi.
Field staff use iPads and Skype to communicate regularly with the officials at the state headquarters about the state of crop, pest, diseases and registration of farmers.
Govind Hande, chief inspecting authority for phytosanitary certification in Maharashtra, said, "We have provided a list of pesticides with label claim to the mango growers. They will get 'fit for export' certificate only if their samples pass all the tests. If the samples have a problem, the exporters will get alert notice." Mango exporters are hopeful that the online system will help boost their business.
"The Grapenet system gave very good results. As Mangonet will be on similar lines, it will be good for mango exports," said Kaushal Khakar, CEO at Mumbaibased KB Exports.

RBI keeps key rates unchanged; says premature to change monetary policy stance

(RBI Governor Raghurma Rajan…)
MUMBAI: Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan left interest rates unchanged for the fifth time in a row, awaiting firm signals that consumer price inflation will slide convincingly and remain low for a long time.
But he gave a strong indication that rate cuts could come early in 2015.
"A change in the monetary policy stance at the current juncture is premature," Rajan said in the statement accompanying the announcement. "However, if the current inflation momentum and changes in inflationary expectations continue, and fiscal developments are encouraging, a change in the monetary policy stance is likely early next year, including outside the policy review cycle."
He also signposted two critical decisions that will be announced soon-- one is on the 5-25 funding structure for infrastructure projects that was announced in the budget, the other is on banks taking equity during debt restructuring. The price at which this can be done is being discussed with the Securities and Exchange Board of India, he said.
The governor's decision is on expected lines as nearly every economist said there wouldn't be a change in interest rates, barring a few hopefuls after the decision of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries decision to keep supplies stable pushed down crude oil prices to four-year lows.
"We are certainly seeing a disinflationary process," Rajan said at a press conference after the policy was unveiled. "We want to get more certainty on the disinflationary process."
The governor reiterated his oft-stated position that it was important to win the battle on prices rather than ease monetary policy to early only to have them popping up again.
"We want to make sure that this is for real, we don't want to flip-flop," he said. "We'd rather change for good."
In answer to another question, he said, "We're not trying to manage long-interest rates."
Rajan said those clamouring for interest rate cuts were being short-sighted. The central bank was not looking at quarter-to-quarter numbers. "We're talking about tears of sustainable growth... that is a message that has to seep through."
Still, the RBI forecast of consumer inflation has been revised down to 6% in March 2015. The growth projection for 2014-15 has however been retained at 5.5%. Revising his earlier hawkish tone in the previous policy statement when he expressed concerns about upside risks to inflation, the statement said, "The risks to the January 2016 target of 6% appear evenly balanced under the current policy stance."
The RBI has reservations about the evolution of the base effect in inflation, how long ongoing disinflationary impulses last, the pace of change of the public's inflationary expectations, as well as the success of the government's efforts to hit deficit targets.
The repo rate, at which RBI lends to banks, remained at 8%, and so did all the other rates. The cash reserve requirement, the proportion of deposits that banks have to keep with the central bank, remains at 4%.
"RBI would like inflation to be sustainable at lower level before lowering rates," said Naresh Takker, MD and CEO of rating company ICRA. "Also, one should bear in mind that the inflation number may go up next month due to lower agriculture productions and also the benefit of the base effect would reverse soon," he added.
Governor Rajan has been under pressure from various quarters for a reduction since prices are sliding fast amid uncertain growth indicators. But economists have been of the view that the fall could be temporary, given the base effect and that there are chances of a sharp jump in the CPI reading early next year.
  Inflation as measured by the CPI that came into force in 2012, fell to a record of 5.5% in October. That is lower than the RBI's target of 6% by March 2016. The central bank aims to target inflation permanently at 4%, in a band of 2% on either side, as recommended by the Urjit Patel Committee.
To be sure, household inflation expectations are still high at more than 15%. Information on the enhancement of supplies of protein-rich products, an item that pushed up CPI, is flaky. Positive real interest rates need to be sustained for a longer term if an economic revival is to be supported by domestic savings.
While the policy rates have been high, market rates have been easing with the yield on the benchmark government bonds falling more than 100 basis points from its peak expecting a rate cut.
Furthermore, the demand for loans has fallen to three-year lows to 11%, even though deposits have gained momentum, thanks to positive real interest rates for the first time in more than four years.
But given the Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government measures such as releasing more food stocks into the market and low increase in minimum support prices, inflation is expected to be lower than it was under the previous government.
The industrial climate is also looking to be turning for the better with second-quarter gross domestic product growing at 5.3%, above the forecast of 5.1%, though slower than the 5.7% rate in April-June. HSBC's PMI in November rose to its highest since February 2013 at 53.3.

Women better at defining casual sex encountersBy: Indo-Asian News Service | Toronto |
Posted: December 2, 2014 5:49 pm | Updated: December 2, 2014 5:51 pm
Women are better at defining casual sex encounters than men, says a new study, adding that this is because such sexual encounters put women in a more risky situation in society.
To reach this conclusion, researchers from the University of Ottawa in Canada sent an online questionnaire to 800 participants below the age of 30 on social media.
It asked about their personal sexual experience and how would they define forms of causal sex such as one night stands, booty calls and friends with benefits, the National Post reported.
The questionnaire described a one night stand as sex between strangers or people who do not know each other that well.
A booty call often involves late night drunken text messages or phone calls that lead to sex between people who do know each other.
Friends with benefits refers to a relationship that is not all about fornication (consensual sexual intercourse between two people not married to each other) and is likely to survive as a friendship when the sex stops.
Overall, more than 81 percent of participants got the definitions for each phrase right and women performed better.
“We found that women who have had sex are better than men at deciphering the lingo for casual sexual relationships because of the greater risk uncommitted coitus poses to them,” the authors said.
The findings appeared in the Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality.

Sahara to sell 4 local assets for Rs 2 700 croreSahara to sell 4 local assets for Rs 2,700 crore
BS Reporter | New Delhi Dec 03, 2014 12:50 AM IST
The Supreme Court allowed the Sahara group on Tuesday to sell a property in Choma village near Gurgaon at a price 15 per cent lower than the value estimated earlier. This was part of a set of four domestic properties with a combined worth of around Rs 2,700 crore that the group was allowed to sell as part of its efforts to secure bail for its chief Subrata Roy.
The other properties situated in Jodhpur, Vasai and Pune are being sold at values within the five per cent margin permitted by the court in June. Sahara submitted three demand drafts and cheque for a sum of Rs 184.5 crore as a down payment for these sales. The remaining sale consideration from these properties is expected to be received by May 2015.
The court further directed the group to address questions raised by Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) counsel Arvind Datar and amicus curiae Shekhar Naphade on the three-way loan agreement involving the overseas assets the group has proposed to raise the bank guarantee required for the release of Roy.
The group has sought to bring in a new lender to replace Bank of China, which at present has a lien over the hotel assets, and raise a fresh junior loan of $650 million.
Naphade said, “My friend says so much money will come. But from the documents produced , we are not able to verify that.” He also pointed out that the escrow account through which this arrangement will operate was subject to US laws. He expressed concerns that the junior loan being raised was at a higher interest rate and was for a period of 364 days only. “What happens after these 364 days?” he asked.
Datar questioned why the group was coming out with such arrangements when it had demanded and got special facilities to negotiate sale of the foreign assets. “Unless you can demonstrate that sale was an impossibility, where is the question of junior loan?” he asked. He also said that Sebi had received e-mails from buyers about the offers they had given, but Sahara did not deal with them because it was not happy with the “credibility of the buyer”.
Datar wondered, “How are you bothered?” Judge T S Thakur came to the rescue saying, “The buyer should have deep pockets.” S Ganesh, Sahara’s counsel, readily agreed saying, “That is the only credibility we are bothered about. Many of these offers were much below the valuation we were negotiating.” The judges also observed that the possibility of appointing an asset manager who could oversee the sale of assets, if they were to fetch a higher value could be explored.
“It’s all taken you nowhere. If it’s difficult for you, can we assist you? Can an asset management company be asked to take over?” Thakur asked.
According to a March order, Sahara has to deposit Rs 5,000 crore in cash and an equal sum in bank guarantee to secure bail for Roy and two directors of Sahara India Real Estate Corp and Sahara Housing Invest Corp.
The two firms have been found guilty of raising Rs 24,029 crore through issue of optionally fully convertible debentures in violation of Sebi regulations. Roy and the directors have been lodged in Tihar jail since March after the group failed to adhere to Supreme Court directions to refund the sum to investors with interest.
The court had allowed Roy special facilities inside the Tihar jail complex to negotiate the sale of three overseas properties. Despite staying there for about a month in August-September, the deals for sale could not go through. Rajeev Dhawan, Sahara counsel, said: “Sale was politically complicated. So, we devised a second route.”

JSW Steel shelves Rs 35 000-crore West Bengal plantJSW Steel puts Rs 35,000-crore West Bengal plant on hold

JSW Steel said on Tuesday it has "put on hold" building a steel plant in the eastern part of the country due to uncertainty in sourcing key raw materials such as iron ore and coal.
JSW Steel , which is the country's third-largest steelmaker , had planned to build a steel plant in West Bengal with an output of 10 million tonnes a year at an investment of Rs 35,000 crore ($5.66 billion).
The company cited a Supreme Court verdict in September that scrapped most coal extraction permits granted to companies over the last two decades, after ruling the allocation process as arbitrary and illegal.
"Besides iron ore linkage for this project, the recent cancellation of coal mining concessions has added further uncertainty," JSW said in a filing to the stock exchange.
In November, Jindal Steel and Power (JSPL) told Reuters it had shelved a US $10 billion coal-to-diesel project after the SC decision to scrap coal mines.

  Don t Intend to Flip Flop on PolicyChina December Industrial Activity Shrinks for First Time in 7 Months
Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India does not intend to flip-flop on policy and is in discussions with the government for a new monetary framework which it hopes to finalise shortly, Governor Dr Raghuram Rajan said.
The central bank's talks with the government suggest "things will be on track with respect to fiscal deficit," he added during a press conference with reporters.
The RBI held interest rates steady as widely expected at its policy review on Tuesday, but said it could cut interest rates by early next year depending on whether inflation eases further and on fiscal developments.
The government is comfortable with setting a 4 percent inflation target plus/minus 2 per cent beyond 2016, Dr Rajan clarified.
The central bank is "certainly seeing disinflationary process" and global crude oil developments are positive for India.
The central bank is already providing "substantial liquidity" to the market, consistent with the policy rate, Dr Rajan said.

 Lending  Deposit Rates Likely to Stay Unchanged: SBINew Delhi: Interest rates, both for deposit and lending, are likely to remain static as the Reserve Bank today kept the key rate unchanged at its fifth bi-monthly monetary policy review.
"Interest rates are likely to remain unchanged," SBI chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya told PTI.
Echoing similar views Yes Bank CEO and managing director Rana Kapoor said: "Base rate and benchmark prime lending rate are unlikely to see any downward revision at the moment. It can happen only after policy rate moderates."
However, he said, there could be some adjustment in interest rate of deposits of long tenure over 3 years.
Some of the banks have done this and some more could do it based on their asset liability position, Mr Kapoor said, adding that a few more banks can make changes in the coming days as system has ample liquidity.
According to United Bank of India executive director Deepak Narang, margins of banks are already under pressure due to high NPA level. "So, I don't see a cut in the interest rate at the moment," he said.
RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan today kept interest rate unchanged, saying that a shift in stance is 'premature' but hinted that a cut may come early next year if inflation continues to ease and government acts on the fiscal side.
Accordingly, the repo rate continues to be at 8 per cent while the cash reserve ratio has also been retained at 4 per cent despite inflation based on the Wholesale Price Index coming down to a 5-year low of 1.77 per cent in October.
The low inflation is not because of structural changes in the domestic economy but due to fall in international prices of crude, which has declined to a historical low, said Shashwat Sharma, Partner - Financial services, KPMG India.
"Therefore, we understand and appreciate the RBI's stance on no cut in interest rates and look forward to structural changes by the government in the domestic economy," he added.
However, RBI has clearly opened the window for rate cuts to begin in the next review in February 2015 or possibly earlier, Kapoor said.
"I see space for monetary accommodation to the tune of close to 100 basis point cut over the course of next 12 months in 2015-16," he added.

 RBI Aims to Keep Real Interest Rates at 1.5-2%China December Industrial Activity Shrinks for First Time in 7 Months
Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India will aim for a real interest rate of 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent over the long-term, Governor Raghuram Rajan said on Tuesday.
The central bank would gradually move towards a new monetary policy structure next year, he said. The government is expected to amend the RBI Act by early next year to incorporate a monetary policy committee that gives voting rights to officials both within and outside the central bank.
The comments come after the RBI kept the repo rate on hold at 8.00 per cent on Tuesday.

HP to pass TCP bill to regularise illegal constructions  cabinet gives nodWritten by Ashwani Sharma | Shimla |
Posted: December 2, 2014 9:12 pm
Ending suspense over impending move to regularise illegal constructions in all major urban towns, including Shimla, the state cabinet on Tuesday cleared the draft bill to grant one-time benefit to the citizens having raised buildings up to six stories and  done 70 percent deviations from sanctioned construction plan.
The bill replaces an Ordinance earlier promulgated in September 2014 but later withdrawn by the cabinet.Biggest change done in the draft bill approved today is a significant reduction in the compounding fee chargeable from the residents getting relaxations for committing violations.
The fee ( one-time penalty) has been reduced to just one-fifth of what was proposed earlier in the ordinance. Violations done in a horizontal manner will have compounding charges of Rs 800 per sq meter for ground floor and Rs 400 per sq meter for first and second floors in the municipal areas. For other areas, the rate is half (Rs 400) of what will be chargeable in the first category of municipal areas.
Another category is those of vertical constructions up to six stories will be chargeable @ Rs 1500 per square meter in the municipal areas and Rs 1000 per sq meter in the non-municipal areas.
The bill will be introduced in the winter session of the state assembly beginning at Dharamshala on December 5.This is the second time when the bill will be introduced in the House, after first piloted during the budget session in February 2014, but were referred to the select committee.
Yet ,the move raises questions as how will state government deal with those violators, who have taken no permissions to raise residential and commercial buildings without following regularisation measures including structural safety norms.
Some buildings have encroached pathways, caused constructions to those having built houses after due approvals and few took advantage of government’s indecision to enact legislation during past two months and committed serious violations.
Says the minister for Urban Development Sudhir Sharma “ during past some days, the government has got videography of buildings done and if it’s recent construction,t he case will not be considered for regularisation. Shimla’s green-belt, core areas of town and heritage zone have been excluded from the purview of the new amendment.
The draft bill, besides straightening of process to regularise illegal buildings has also offered major concessions to the builders lobby, many of these close to the power. They will not be required to get fresh registrations for five years.Earlier provision was only for three years.Concession has also been granted to the real estate developers not to reserve flats for economically weaker sections and bonafide Himachalis if their project is below 40 bighas.
The provisions even go contrary to the report of a Vidhan Sabha committee which was set-up during the BJP regime to detect violations done under the HP Apartments Act.
Cabinet meeting presided over by Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh.
The cabinet also cleared draft Lokayukta Bill, 2014 proposed to give teeth to the anti-graft institution to deal with corruption in the state.It will, however, be a single member body and will not have suo-moto powers continued…

Posted: December 2, 2014 8:24 pm
Australia captain Michael Clarke will be one of the men, who will be carrying his dear friend Phillip Hughes’ coffin, at the funeral service in the deceased cricketer’s hometown in Macksville near Sydney.
Cricket Australia today announced that Clarke will be one of the pallbearers (someone who helps to carry the casket at funeral service where a pall covers late person) and will lead tributes at the funeral service.
Apart from Clarke, other notable cricketer, who will also be a pallbearer, is Australia’s ODI opener Aaron Finch.
Cricket board’s chief executive James Sutherland released the details of the funeral service although he refused to commit as to who all will be available for selection, during the rescheduled first Test against India at the Adelaide Oval, starting December 9.
The funeral in Hughes’ hometown of Macksville on Wednesday will be attended by the Australian Test squad as well as past and present cricketing greats including Mark Taylor, Sir Richard Hadlee, Brian Lara, Virat Kohli, Ravi Shastri, Shane Warne, Mike Hussey, Ricky Ponting, Brett Lee, Adam Gilchrist and Glenn McGrath.
Prime Minister Tony Abbott is also due to attend the service and expected to pay tribute to the late cricketer.
Since the funeral service will be held on Wednesday, Cricket Australia yesterday decided to resechedule the itinerary after discussions with BCCI and other stakeholders with Adelaide hosting the first instead of second Test and Gabba Test will be the venue for the second Test starting December 17.
“There is nothing perfect about what we have come up with here but we appreciate everyone’s support and understanding in these tragic and extraordinary circumstances,” Sutherland told reporters.
The traditional ‘Boxing Day’ clash in Melbourne remaining unchanged, while the Sydney Test has been pushed back three days and will now start on January 6

Subrata Roy s Sahara group permitted by SC to sell 4 properties worth over Rs 2 700 crDirect equity set to top FDs as biggest asset class in FY15: Report
The Supreme Court today permitted the Subrata Roy’s Sahara Group to proceed with the sale of four domestic properties, which is likely to fetch Rs 2,710 crore, in its bid to raise Rs 10,000 crore to secure his release from jail.
The court allowed the group to sell properties in Jodhpur, Pune, Chauma in Gurgaon and Vasai in Mumbai after it was satisfied that the transactions were in accordance with its June 4 order.
This order had stated that “such sales are not for a price lower than the estimated value indicated in the statement filed before this Court or the circle rates fixed for the area in which such properties are situated”.
A bench headed by Justice T S Thakur was told that the transactions for these properties would be completed by May 2015 and in the meantime, the purchasers would deposit post-dated cheques in the name of SEBI-Sahara refund account with undertakings that those would be honoured on due dates.
The bench, also comprising justices A R Dave and A K Sikri, was informed that the group has already generated Rs 184.5 crore as part payment for its assets in Jodhpur, Chauma and Vasai and following which it was allowed to hand over three demand drafts and one cheque to SEBI’s counsel.
Regarding the sale of Pune property which would fetch Rs 550 crore, Sahara group through senior advocates Rajiv Dhawan and S Ganesh said that the agreement was not signed due to unavoidable circumstances and in the near future, the deal will be through and it is expected to get Rs 50 crore as initial part payment.
Accepting the proposal, the bench permitted it to go ahead with the proposed deal and deposit Rs 50 crore with SEBI-Sahara refund account.
Out of the list of nine domestic properties, Sahara has already sold its Ahmedabad property and has raised Rs 411.82 crores which has gone into the account of SEBI.
However, Sahara Group would have to wait for getting clearance for raising ‘junior loan’ of USD 650 million (approx. Rs 3,600 crore) as a part of the scheme to overcome the liability with Bank of China which had lent money to it in purchasing stakes in three overseas hotels, Dream Downtown and The Plaza in New York and Grosvenor House in London.
SEBI’s counsel Arvind Dattar and senior advocate Shekhar Naphade, who is assisting the court as an amicus curiae in the matter, submitted that certain terms of transactions were not clear like the issue of escrow agent and the liability which is likely to rise for the Sahara.
The bench asked the Sahara Group to provide all information sought by the amicus and the market regulator within a week and posted the matter for further hearing on December 17.
At the outset, Dhawan said substantial amout has been paid by Sahara Group to SEBI and Rs 1882 crore remains and it be allowed to give cheques for remaining dues.
“We would not like to accept post-date cheques at this stage,” the bench said.
The group also sought court’s specific direction with regard to its bid to sell the Pune property and said that some sort of confusion has been created due to some media reports.
“You have already been permitted,” the court said.
During the hearing, the court expressed dissatisfaction over the progress in the sale of properties and suggested that it can also assist in their disposal by taking help of an assets management company.
Earlier, Sahara Group had approached the court with a fresh proposal for securing release of Subrato Roy.
Roy, who was sent to jail on March 4 this year for non- refund of over Rs 20,000 crore with interest to depositors, was asked by the court to pay Rs 10,000 crore to get bail, out of which Rs 5,000 crore should be paid in cash and rest of the amount in bank guarantee.
Sahara, which earlier had raised Rs 3,117 crore and deposited with SEBI, has told the court that out of nine domestic assets it has now sold an Ahmedabad property and raised Rs 411.82 crores which has also gone into account of the market regulator.
Earlier, SEBI had moved the court seeking its direction to Sahara group to give a time schedule for payment of Rs 47,000 crore to it.
In the application, SEBI had submitted that the group be directed to furnish all details before the court regarding offers it received for its three luxury hotels, which was to be put on sale to raise money to be deposited with it.
The apex court had earlier allowed Roy, 65, to use the conference room in Tihar jail complex to hold negotiations with potential buyers for selling the hotels in New York and London.
Court lets India’s Sahara sell $424 mln of local properties
(Reuters) India’s Sahara conglomerate on Tuesday won the Supreme Court’s approval to sell four of its domestic properties, which it said would raise 26.22 billion rupees ($424 million), crucial to secure the bail of its jailed chief.
Sahara Chairman Subrata Roy has been held in a New Delhi jail for almost nine months in a long-running dispute with the country’s capital markets regulator over the refund of billions of dollars the group raised in outlawed bonds.
The Supreme Court has asked Sahara to deposit 100 billion rupees initially to release Roy on bail. Sahara has said it would mortgage or sell its overseas hotels, including the Plaza in New York and Grosvenor House in London, to raise funds.
Last week, Sahara sought the court’s approval to take over a Bank of China loan on the overseas hotels and also raise $650 million more in loans through a refinancing to pay off the bail money.
The court has sought more information from the capital markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, and Sahara on the refinancing of the overseas properties and will hear the case next on Dec. 17.

Atletico de Kolkata coach Antonio Lopez Habas alleges biased refereeingBy: Press Trust of India | New Delhi |
Posted: December 2, 2014 10:14 pm
Atletico de Kolkata’s temperamental coach Antonio Lopez Habas today created a flutter when he said that his team was suffering from refereeing bias in the ISL.
“Today we were denied of two clear penalties (Fikru being allegedly felled) by the referee. I don’t know why the referees have been against us from the beginning of the league,” Habas expressed his views through his interpreter.
Habas has already been suspended for two matches for allegedly assaulting FC Goa captain Robert Pires and venting his ire against match officials. The actions may not go down well with parent body and organisers. Habas is on a two-match suspended sentence but his comments are expected to be closely monitored.
While he said that he was “happy” with his team’s performance, he wasn’t exactly happy with the result.
When asked why Luis Garcia wasn’t fielded, Habas replied: “A coach knows which Player to use and what time. Well I wanted to use Garcia but Biswajit Saha got injured and I had to shelve my plans.”
Delhi Dynamos coach said that ATK’s defensive tactics did create problems.
“I didn’t expect ATK to be so defensive. You can say it’s hard to play against a team that plays for a point. Souvik (Chakraborty) missed a great chance. I was surprised to not find Garcia in the line-up but one look at their midfield combination made it clear as to what was their aim. I am not complaining as players gave it all that they had,” Dynamos couch Harm Van Veldhoven said.
He was asked an obvious question about Alessandro del Piero looking lackadaisical during practice and he gave a curt reply: “I didn’t see what you saw. Also I concentrate on players who are playing the game.”

Ranbaxy in Talks With Fair Trade Regulator on  Specific Products  for Sun dealSpiceJet Cancellations Trigger Chaos At Airports
New Delhi: Awaiting a long-pending approval for its merger with Sun Pharmaceutical, drug maker Ranbaxy has said it is in talks with the Competition Commission of India (CCI) with regard to "certain products".
"We are in communication with the Competition Commission of India (CCI) on specific products and as of now have not received any final order from the CCI regarding divestment of the products," Ranbaxy Laboratories said on Tuesday.
The statement was made in reply to a clarification sought by the National Stock Exchange (NSE) from the company on reports that CCI wants changes to its deal with Sun Pharmaceutical.
The $4-billion deal, which CCI has prima facie found to be in violation of competition norms, was inked in April this year.
The competition watchdog has suggested Sun Pharma and Ranbaxy to make certain changes in their proposed merger deal, including possible divestment of some brands, to address anti-competitive concerns.
Sources had said the regulator was now awaiting response from the parties on the suggested changes.
Among others, the regulator is believed to have suggested divestment of some brands in order to comply with competition norms, sources had said.
The Sun Pharma-Ranbaxy transaction, which would create the country's largest pharmaceutical company, had come under close scrutiny of CCI after it was found prima facie that the "combination is likely to have an  appreciable adverse effect on competition".
The combined entity would have operations in 65 countries, 47 manufacturing facilities across 5 continents, and a significant platform of speciality and generic products marketed globally. The deal is also the first one where the commission sought public comments.
Major issues examined by CCI on the deal are with respect to the molecules market.
Sun Pharmaceutical said on Monday that the competition watchdog has been seeking additional information and detailed clarifications with respect to specific aspects of the products for the purpose of making its assessment.
"We see the process nearing its logical closure. We are happy with the open and transparent manner in which the matter has progressed. It is our intent to fully comply with all the regulatory requirements as required to close the transaction," Sun Pharma had said in a statement.

An unrelenting Opposition rejects Union Minister Niranjan Jyoti's apology, demands her dismissal

New Delhi: Union Minister of State for Food Processing Industries Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti on Tuesday apologised to the Parliament for her controversial remarks in Monday's public rally in New Delhi. However, the Opposition refused to relent, saying they wanted her to be sacked.
"I had no intentions of hurting sentiments. I regret my statement," Jyoti said.
The Opposition, while dismissing the apology, demanded that an FIR must be lodged against her as she has accepted a cognizable offence. They also demanded that the minister must be sacked and the Prime Minister, as head of the government, should make a statement on the floor of the House.
#sadhvi niranjan jyoti #sitaram yechury #parliament #rahul gandhi
CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said, "Since she has apologised in the House and admitted to a crime, let an FIR be filed. Till then she should not continue as a member of the Cabinet."
Senior Congress leader Ashwani Kumar said, "No less than the Prime Minister of the country should come and explain what actions he propose to take against the minister."
Feeling the heat, the government fielded its senior ministers to defend itself. Leader of House in the Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitely, while condemning the statement of his colleague, said the Opposition must allow the law to take its course.
"We condemn it. Let the House function," Jaitley said.
It was Jyoti's hate speech which rocked the Parliament. Outside, the Opposition sought accountability from the NDA on all the poll promises made during the election campaign.
Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi, making one of those rare appearances at the Gandhi statue, said, "It's a government of U-turns, be it on the issue of black money, CAG or corruption."

Anil Kumar Sinha
(The Appointments Committee…)
NEW DELHI: Senior IPS officer Anil Kumar Sinha was tonight appointed the new CBI Director to succeed Ranjit Sinha who retired in a glare of controversy with the Supreme Court directing him to recuse from 2G spectrum scam case probe.
Sinha, a 1979 batch IPS officer of Bihar cadrde , was the Special Director in CBI.
The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi , cleared the name of Anil Kumar Sinha who was among the candidates shortlisted by the search committee earier this evening.
The term of Sinha will be for two years from the date he takes charge, an official notification said.
Earlier in the day, Modi held discussions with the Chief Justice of India and leader of the main Opposition in Lok Sabha on selecting a new CBI head.
The panel discussed the names of about 40 officers shortlisted by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), sources said.
Ranjit Sinha retired today after a tumultuous tenure of two years at the helm of affairs in CBI that ended on a controversial note.
Sinha's tenure as CBI chief saw highs like busting of some big bribery cases involving a Railway Board member, Chairman and Managing Director of a public sector bank, Chief Executive Officer of Censor Board among others.
The lows were mainly the criticism he faced from the Supreme Court which asked him to withdraw from 2G probe, criticism from a special court for shoddy probe in coal scam cases, sharing of status report in coal with the then Law Minister Ashwani Kumar after which the agency earned the sobriquet of "caged parrot" from the apex court.

Raghuram Rajan urges more equity participation by banks in CDRIndian rupee slips past psychological $63 mark to hit 13-month low
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Tuesday said banks may be allowed own  a larger stake in companies whose loans were being restructured; currently they are allowed to own 10%.
Governor Raghuram Rajan observed on Tuesday that this was a global practice and said the idea was to give banks some flexibility help put the project back on track. “The key is to see that banks don’t overpay for the shares and we are in discussions with Sebi to see how that can be achieved,” the governor said adding that minority shareholders shouldn’t get hurt in the process. Banks have been asking for a higher share of equity so that they enjoy the upside when the company recovers.
However, they want a change in the pricing rule. PK Malhotra, DMD, State Bank of India (SBI), told FE that the Sebi formula resulted in banks buying equity at a much higher price than the ruling market price. “The idea is a sound one provided the conversion of debt into equity takes place at a reasonable price,” Malhotra said adding that it would make the project more viable.
The conversion of restructured debt into equity brings in more responsibility on the table for banks, analysts said. Arun Tiwari, chairman and managing director, Union Bank of India told a news channel on Tuesday, “Typically when there is stress, bankers suffer. Now, when there is upside, if I am an equity holder let me have those fruits also.”
The total amount of loans recast in FY14 has been more than R1 lakh crore on the back of R 1.3 lakh crore of referrals. Banking sector non performing assets (NPAs) stood at R2.72 lakh crore in Q2 FY15, up 6.3%, sequentially.
The governor also commented on errant borrowers. “There is a category where promoters are deliberately standing in the way of recovery and some are actually fraud where assets have been taken out of the business and sometimes money has been transferred abroad. There, we have to send a strong message that these kinds of action is intolerable in the Indian scenario, and you will not get away from it”.

BJP says don t politicise issue after minister apologises over remarkComments
Minister of state for food processing industries Niranjan Jyoti Tuesday tendered an apology in Parliament for using abusive language at an election campaign in Delhi but failed to douse the opposition fire even as the Bharatiya Janata Party Tuesday said the issue should not be stretched.

On Monday, Jyoti had said people of Delhi must decide if they wanted a government of Ramzaadon (followers of Ram) or a government of those who are illegitimate.
Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said in Rajya Sabha the government did not support Jyoti's remark, but he also asked the Opposition to "maintain decorum."
Naqvi said those in the government and the opposition should use dignified language and in the past UPA ministers too had crossed the line many times.
As Rajya Sabha session was adjourned for a third time, finance minister Arun Jaitley said Jyoti's comments were "improper and unacceptable".
He said since the minister had apologised and withdrawn her statement, "what happens outside isn't within domain of this House".
But BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra seemed to be defending her by saying it was a "slip of tongue" and the issue should not be politicised.
The saffron party also hit out at Congress, saying several of its leaders too have made objectionable remarks in the past.
"But have they ever been asked to resign? When did Congress sack them from the party? And they are called experienced leaders while Sadhvi Niranjan has become MP for the first time," UP BJP chief Laxmikant Bajpai said.
According to reports, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked party MPs to abstain from addressing the nation and also condemned the comments made by Jyoti.
Modi asked the MPs to avoid making uncalled for statements at the parliamentary board meeting held ahead of Parliament session on Tuesday.
Opposition demands resignation
The issue rocked both the Houses as agitated opposition MPs disrupted proceedings, seeking an explanation from the Prime Minister and demanding an apology from Jyoti, who joined the Narendra Modi's cabinet early last month.
The remarks drew the ire of Opposition which protested in Parliament following which Jyoti expressed "deep regret" and apologised for her actions saying she did not intend to hurt anyone's feelings.
"My intention was not to hurt anyone. If my speech outside the House has hurt anyone, I express my deep regrets," Jyoti said in Lok Sabha.
She said if certain words spoken by her outside the House have hurt someone, she is ready to take back her words and offer regrets. She also said she is ready to seek an apology.
The Opposition, however, refused to accept her apology and said she must resign or should be removed from her post.
Drama in House
As soon as Lok Sabha met for the day, Mallikarjun Kharge, leader of the Congress, took up the issue with Speaker Sumitra Mahajan.
Kharge said the "objectionable" language used by Jyoti had created tension at a time when there had been quite a few communal riots.
Several Congress and Trinamool Congress members, too, rushed to the Well, shouting slogans.
Both Houses saw brief adjournments over the protests, even as Mahajan cautioned all members to be mindful of their speech.
"The Prime Minister should give an explanation," Congress leader Anand Sharma said.
Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati said the minister's remarks were against the secular ethos espoused by the Constitution and do not behold a person occupying a constitutional post.
The BJP should sack her, she said.
Mayawati and CPI(M) MP Sitaram Yechury demanded that an FIR be filed against Jyoti.
The Congress alleged that Jyoti had insulted the people of Delhi and she should issue an apology while the Aam Aadmi Party said it was the BJP's real face.
"The divisive thinking and divisive politics of the BJP has been exposed," Congress leader Ambika Soni said.
Manish Sisodia of Aam Aadmi Party said, "This is the real character of BJP. Their language shows what kind of work they are doing at the Centre and what kind of work they will do for Delhi."
Members of Congress, TMC, SP and other opposition parties rushed to the Well during the uproar over her remarks leading to four adjournments in Rajya Sabha and one in Lok Sabha during pre-lunch sitting.
Later, outside Parliament, the minister was asked about demands for her resignation.
"I have apologised and I have nothing else to say," she replied.
Following the controversy, Jyoti said, "I did not take name of any particular individual, community or party. I was talking about separatist parties and leaders who think of dividing the country..."
She later clarified her statement was for those who didn't believe in Ram and unified India, adding her remarks must not be given any communal overtone.
"Those who have sold the country, made it bankrupt, people will not voter for such people. Is it a crime to talk about Ram? How can talking about Ram be communal?"
"Muslims offer namaz in mosques, we do no object. Christians pray in churches, we do not object. Then talking about Ram should not be termed as communal. And those who call me communal, I would say what could be more communal than this."
"Do you want a government of people who believe in Ram, a government that believes in people. And i would like to say one more thing, be it Hindu or a Christian in the country, he is an offspring of Ram. And those who refuse to believe this, will never believe in this country also," she said.
Jyoti is credited with helping the ruling BJP make inroads among the Dalit and backward classes in the politically crucial state of Uttar Pradesh.
She is among the six BJP MPs drafted into the party's campaign for the Delhi polls due early next year.

Xiaomi Redmi Note sold out on Flipkart in 6 secondsXiaomi Redmi Note sold out on Flipkart in 6 seconds
BT Online Bureau     New Delhi   Last Updated: December 3, 2014  | 13:52 IST
Xiaomi's Redmi Note smartphone has been sold out in 6 seconds. Its global VP Hugo Barra took to Twitter to announce that its latest product in India was sold out on e-commerce portal, Flipkart. The company had offered 50,000 devices on sale costing Rs.8,999.
"Mi India: Redmi Note out of stock in 6 secs today! @Flipkart @MiIndiaOfficial ," tweeted Barra, who previously worked in Google before joining the Chinese company.

China HSBC services PMI edges up to 53 in NovChina HSBC services PMI edges up to 53 in November

(New orders were especially…)
BEIJING: China's services sector grew marginally faster in November as new orders rose at their quickest pace in 2-1/2 years, a private survey showed, an encouraging sign of strength that contrasts sharply with the gloom in the other parts of the economy.
The HSBC/Markit Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) inched up to 53.0 last month from October's 52.9, above the 50-point level that separates growth from contraction in activity on a monthly basis.
New orders were especially buoyant. The new business sub-index climbed to 54.2 in November from 53.1 the previous month, a high not seen since May 2012.
The resilience in the services sector compares with cooling growth in Chinese factories. A pair of manufacturing PMIs showed earlier this week that growth in factories in November slid to lows unseen in at least six months.
The dour factory reports were the latest in a run of underwhelming data from the world's second-largest economy, and reinforced bets that authorities could further loosen fiscal and monetary policy in coming months to stoke growth.
"Downside pressures on the economy still persist," said Qu Hongbin, an economist at HSBC in Hong Kong. Qu said he expected further policy easing in coming weeks.
After saying for months that China doesn't need any big economic stimulus, the central bank unexpectedly cut interest rates on Nov. 21 by 40 basis points, its biggest reduction since November 2008 at the height of the global financial crisis.
Hurt by a sagging housing market, slowing domestic demand and investment and unsteady export sales, China's economy is forecast by some analysts to be headed towards its worst slowdown in 24 years this year with annual growth at 7.4 per cent.
In a sign that companies were feeling the drag of an unsteady economy, a sub-index for business expectations for the year ahead dipped to a three-month low even though it stayed well above the 50-point level.
But firms were still hiring, with an employment sub-index hovering above 50 as some companies expanded their businesses, HSBC/Markit said.
Input prices also rose as some companies reported spending more on labour as they increased staff numbers.
Firms that were doing well passed on such cost increases to their clients by raising prices, HSBC/Markit said.

Naxal attack: Rs 38 lakh for kin of each killed jawanPM Narendra Modi speaks to Nawaz Sharif, says India stands firmly with Pak in fight against terror, offers all support
The next of kin of each of the 14 CRPF personnel killed by Naxals in Sukma district of Chhattisgarh, will be paid Rs 38 lakh and every injured security man will be given Rs 65,000, Home Minister Rajnath Singh announced.
The Home Minister, who visited the jawans of CRPF a day after a force contingent was attacked by Naxals, said CPI (Maoist) has posed a big challenge and the entire nation has to be united to fight this menace.
“We have more casualty from proxy war than actual war. This incident will not deter our security forces and they will continue to march ahead in the ongoing operations,” he said.
Singh termed incident in Sukma district as very unfortunate and an act of cowardice.
He said bodies of those martyred have been brought here and all arrangements have been made to send them to their families.
“All jawans who have been hospitalised are out of danger. I am glad that the determination of the hospitalised jawans is still intact. I am paying tribute to the bodies of the departed soldiers and offering condolence to the family members,” he said.
The Home Minister said the operation was on in Sukma for the past five days and in such remote areas, the danger of Maoist attack was very high.
“But our brave jawans fought with national spirit and fulfilled their duty. I salute this spirit amd salute their bravery,” he said.

Coal India agrees to NTPC s sample testingCoal India agrees to NTPC's sample testing

(NTPC had been complaining…)
KOLKATA: NTPC has prevailed in its standoff with the monopoly public sector miner Coal India, which has now agreed to the longstanding demand of raising bills and taking payments on the basis of fuel quality sampled by the third-party agents at the loading point.
NTPC had been complaining that Coal India was supplying fuel of inferior quality at prices that were not acceptable.
Loading points are mostly railway sidings where the coal is stored temporarily on rakes. Now, not just NTPC but all power producers will have the option of turning to thirdparty sampling agents at loading points and Coal India will raise bills on the basis of the assessment of these agents.
"CIL has agreed to allow NTPC to conduct sampling exercise at loading points. The result of this sampling will be used to ascertain the quality of the coal, on the basis of which bills raised will be adjusted at a later stage.
NTPC is now in the process of appointing third-party sampling agents for its thermal power stations ," said a senior NTPC official.
According to a senior Coal India official, the miner has set up a panel of 25 third-party sampling agents. The consumers will have to select their sampling agents from this list and appoint them at various loading points, the official said, adding that these agents will independently sample the coal being sent for dispatch and Coal India will accept the result of this samplers.
"Bills will be raised on the basis of sampling by these agents and payments will also be accepted," said the official, requesting anonymity.
"Coal samples will be analysed at accredited laboratories or at labs owned by Coal India, if they exist, or at any other accredited lab near the location," he added.
The agreement brings to an end a 20-month long impasse triggered by coal supply stoppage for four days during early April 2013. NTPC had then started paying Coal India on the basis of sampling done on the coal received at its power plants, but the miner refused to accept this arrangement.

2nd phase poll turnout: 71% in J-K  64.4% JharkhandComments
Voters walked on frost and through a blanket of fog to log an overwhelming 71% turnout in the second phase of assembly election in militancy-hit Jammu and Kashmir on Tuesday, just shy of the first-round figure.

Jharkhand, another insurgency-hit state to go to polls, recorded 66.38% polling despite this phase coinciding with an annual event of the Maoists’ military wing, the People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army.
People of both states defied fear of attack following poll boycott calls by separatists and insurgents, especially residents of frontier areas along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir where 80% polling was recorded in some booths. Kulgam, close to Shopian where back-to-back militant attacks on two sarpanches have rocked the area, showed its contempt for violence with an impressive turnout.
The only people complaining about the cold were the election staff stationed at a godown-turned-booth without heating and food. Voters kept themselves warm with traditional fire pots (kangri) and animated conversations on “change” — the leitmotif of this year’s poll.
“I voted for the Muslim United Front in 1987 but the government murdered democracy then. I picked up the gun and joined militant ranks, but even that didn’t change the political problem. I boycotted all the elections … today I am voting for change,” said 47-year-old former separatist Abdul Gani Lone, who is now a contractor.
Another former separatist, Sajad Gani Lone, who is the People’s Conference candidate for the Handwara seat, had stirred the poll pot calling Prime Minister Narendra Modi an “elder brother”.
In Jharkhand, the fate of two former CMs and three CM probables were sealed in ballot boxes. “We elect the CM, not merely an MLA,” said a BJP supporter in Kharsawan, where former CM Arjun Munda is contesting for a record fifth time.
A crow’s flight away, Chaibasa’s BJP candidate JB Tubid, a former home secretary, is tipped to be CM by dint of his tribal identity. Jamshedpur East and West have two of the BJP’s most powerful leaders and CM probables, Raghubar Das and Saryu Roy.
Former CM Madhu Koda, infamous for his alleged involvement in a multi-crore money laundering scam, is trying his luck from Majhgaon under the banner of Jai Bharat Samanta Party.
Voting was held in 20 constituencies, 16 of them reserved for schedule tribe candidates spread over seven districts. “The overall turnout was 59.46% in 2009 elections in 20 constituencies, which has now crossed the 66% mark,” an election official said, adding the percentage might partially increase after final figures arrive in a day or two.

BJP takes dig at Nitish for not campaigningPM Narendra Modi speaks to Nawaz Sharif, says India stands firmly with Pak in fight against terror, offers all support
Taking a dig at Nitish Kumar, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said the Janata Dal (Union) leader “opted out” from campaigning for his party leaders for the Jharkhand Assembly elections as he was aware that he won’t be able to stop the saffron party’s surge to power in the state.
In a tirade against Kumar, former Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi wondered why his former senior ministerial colleague had opted out from campaigning for Janata Dal (Union) candidates in the ongoing Assembly polls in Jharkhand.
“It was because Kumar knew it fully well that he won’t be able to stop the saffron party’s surge to power,” Modi said.
“The senior Janata Dal (Union) leader, who claims to be popular with the masses in Bihar, should have tested political waters in Jharkhand where there is a sizable presence of Bihari people and campaigned for his party candidates, but it seems he knows the ground reality as was the case in Assembly polls in Delhi and Haryana over past year,” he added.
Taking pot shots at the grand alliance of erstwhile constituents of ‘Janata Parivar’ which was formed to take on BJP at the national level, Modi said the experiment seems to have failed in Jharkhand where they are contesting the Assembly polls separately and the Janata Dal (Union) and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) were taking each other on several Assembly seats.
Claiming that a wave in favour of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi was sweeping through Jharkhand too, Modi exuded confidence that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will form the next government in the state.

Gold steadies near $1 200 as oil firms; sentiment remains bearishGold steadies near $1,200 as oil firms; sentiment remains bearish
Reuters
Despite some gains in the first half of the year from geopolitical tensions, gold has fallen in recent months as strong US economic data and expectations of interest rate hikes have boosted the dollar.
Singapore, Dec 3:  
Gold steadied near $1,200 an ounce on Wednesday as a rise in oil prices provided support, but strength in the dollar and optimism about the US economy weighed on the metal's appeal as a hedge.
Bullion also got some help from inflows of 2.4 tonnes into SPDR Gold Trust, the world's top gold-backed exchange-traded fund.
Despite the first inflow in two weeks, the fund's holdings are sitting firmly near a six-year low, underlining bearish sentiment in the market.
Spot gold was little changed at $1,199.44 an ounce at 0346 GMT after falling 1 per cent in the previous session.
"Precious metal prices have been out of favour since July. For starters, the US dollar has rallied. Moreover, inflation expectations have fallen substantially because of a sell-off in oil prices," ABN Amro analyst Georgette Boele said in a note.
Bullion has fallen in tandem with oil in recent sessions on expectations that weaker crude prices could reduce inflationary pressure. The metal is usually seen as a hedge against rising prices.
Oil rebounded more than 1 per cent on Wednesday but Brent and US crude have fallen more than 30 per cent since June and touched five-year lows earlier in the week on supply worries.
Despite some gains in the first half of the year from geopolitical tensions, gold has fallen in recent months as strong US economic data and expectations of interest rate hikes have boosted the dollar.
The greenback hit a seven-year high versus the yen on Wednesday and continued to hold firm against a basket of major currencies, thanks in part to a big rise in US yields as the economic outlook there outshone most of its rich world peers.
Upbeat comments from two influential Federal Reserve officials stressing the positive impact on the US economy of the drop in oil prices contributed to the greenback's strength.
Investors believe demand for gold will fall if rates rise as it is a non-interest-bearing asset.
"We expect the gold price to remain under pressure initially in the first half of next year on the back of growing speculation about increasingly imminent interest rate hikes in the United States," Commerzbank said in a note.
It sees gold falling to $1,125 on average in the second quarter of 2015 but expects it to climb to $1,250 by the end of the year as the pressure abates.

Crude oil rebounds 1% after sharp lossesCrude oil rebounds 1% after sharp losses
Reuters
Tweet
Singapore, Dec 3:  
Oil rebounded more than 1 per cent on Wednesday, with Brent rising above $71 a barrel, recouping some of its losses from the previous session as a turbulent market struggled to find a price floor.
The market has swung through sharp gains and losses since OPEC had announced last week that it would maintain steady output in an oversupplied market. Brent and US crude are down more than 30 per cent since June and touched five-year lows on Monday.
Brent, US crude
Brent crude hit a high of $71.46 a barrel on Wednesday after falling $2 in the previous session. The January contract was up 75 cents at $71.29 by 0210 GMT.
US crude for January was at $67.85 a barrel, up 97 cents, after dropping more than $2 the session before. The contract touched a high of $67.97 after data from the American Petroleum Institute showed a bigger than expected fall in crude inventories.
“The market’s volatility is a result of people working out what’s going to happen next,’’ said Jonathan Barratt, chief investment officer at Ayers Alliance Securities.
He said a low price “will force weak people out of the market and the strong will prevail’’.
OPEC members
Saudi Arabia and other key members have kept output stable in November, underlining their focus on defending market share, a Reuters survey found. OPEC’s oil supply in November declined by 340,000 barrels per day (bpd) due to political instability in Libya.
Yet, Iraq could export more crude after Baghdad reached a temporary deal with Kurdish regional authorities.
Saudi Arabia would only consider cutting production if other countries, including non-OPEC producer Russia, joined in limits, former Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki bin Faisal said.
“Prices should find a volatile low at these levels’’ given that Russia, hurt by a drop in oil revenues, may act to prop up prices, Barratt said.
Other factors that could support oil include whether OPEC will stay united on its policy and when non-OPEC producers will start to cut back output, he said.
Still, chart analysts have warned that the months-long rout is not over yet and US crude may quickly plunge towards $50 per barrel if a handful of tenuous support levels give way after a period of consolidation.
Crude oil stocks
In the United States, crude inventories fell by 6.5 million barrels in the week to November 28 to 373 million, according to API, compared with analyst expectations for an increase of 1.3 million barrels.
Data from the US Energy Information Administration is due on Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. EST (1530 GMT).

Dollar hits 7-year high vs yenDollar hits 7-year high vs yen
Reuters
Tweet
Singapore/Sydney, Dec 3:  
The dollar hit a seven-year peak against the yen on Wednesday, following a rise in US bond yields and Federal Reserve officials' mostly upbeat comments on the outlook for the US economy.
The greenback also rose against the Australian dollar, which slid to a four-year low after data showed Australia's economy unexpectedly slowed last quarter, prompting markets to price in more chances of an interest rate cut.
Against the yen, the dollar climbed to 119.44 yen on trading platform EBS, its strongest level since August 2007. The dollar last traded at 119.35 yen, up 0.1 per cent on the day.
Besides the psychologically key 120.00 yen level, the greenback faces resistance at about 119.56 yen, the 23.6 percent retracement of its 1985 to 2011 decline.
The dollar was supported by a mostly rosy outlook for the US economy given earlier this week by New York Fed President William Dudley and Vice Chair Stanley Fischer.
Providing a positive backdrop for the dollar, U.S. Treasury yields have risen this week, with the two-year yield now at 0.54 percent, having pulled up from a one-month low of 0.457 percent set on Monday.
"In terms of flows, overseas (non-Japanese) players seem to be buying (dollars against the yen) aggressively on dips," said a trader for a Japanese bank in Singapore.
The same trader urged caution, in case Japanese officials voice concerns over the yen's weakness in an attempt to placate voters ahead of Japan's general election on December 14.
Although a fall in the yen can be positive for Japanese exporters' earnings, it can also push up import costs and place a burden on households.
In November, Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso had warned about the yen's weakening, describing it as "too rapid" while sticking to the government's stance of allowing markets to determine exchange rates.
The dollar has been rising against the yen on the back of a diverging trajectory of monetary policies in the United States and Japan. Many market participants expect the Fed to raise interest rates some time next year, while the Bank of Japan just expanded its monetary stimulus in late October.
Dollar-selling by options players could help slow the greenback's rise against the yen for now, said Jeffrey Halley, FX trader for Saxo Capital Markets in Singapore.
"I am expecting a grind higher rather than a rush to 120," Halley said.
The dollar held steady against a basket of major currencies at 88.623, hovering near a four-year high of 88.668 touched on Tuesday.
The euro was steady near $1.2386, hovering within sight of two-year low of $1.2358 set in early November.
The Australian dollar fell 0.6 percent to $0.8395. Earlier on Wednesday, the Aussie dollar fell to $0.8388, its lowest level since July 2010.

Asian shares edge downTweet
Tokyo, Dec 3:  
The dollar marked a fresh seven-year high against the yen on Wednesday, which helped lift the Nikkei to a similar record, while oil prices recovered after data showed a drop in US supply.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged slightly down, while Japan's Nikkei stock average was up about 0.8 per cent after earlier touching its highest level since July 2007.
A pair of surveys showed that China's services sector grew slightly faster in November, though they did not vanquish fears about a softening Chinese economy.
"Downside pressures on the economy still persist," said Qu Hongbin, an economist at HSBC in Hong Kong, adding that he expected further policy easing in coming weeks.
Wall Street
Wall Street posted solid gains on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing at a record high, boosted by gains in energy shares as investors searched for bargains in the sector.
US crude
US crude was up more than 1 per cent to $67.76 a barrel in early Asian trading, after industry group American Petroleum Institute (API) released data showing US crude stocks fell 6.5 million barrels last week.
In recently volatile trade amid massive oversupply, US crude tumbled on Tuesday after rising 4 per cent on Monday, its biggest gain since August 2012.
Saudi Arabia would only consider cutting production if other countries, including non-OPEC producer Russia, joined in limits, former Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki bin Faisal had said on Tuesday.
US economy
While economists fear the sharp drop in global energy prices could fan deflationary pressures in some countries, both New York Fed President William Dudley and Vice Chair Stanley Fischer this week both painted a mostly rosy outlook for the US economy and welcomed the cheaper oil.
“Both were relatively optimistic on the US economy and went out of their way to stress upside benefits to US economy of weaker oil prices,’’ Steven Englander, global head of G10 foreign exchange strategy at CitiFX, said in a note.
“All of this is extremely positive for USD, given that fed funds has priced in an extremely flat policy hike path and the USD looks extremely sensitive to interest rate differentials in the current environment,’’ he added.
US Treasury yields
Rising Treasury yields added to the appeal of the US dollar on Wednesday. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield ticked up to 2.292 per cent in Asian trade, up from its US close of 2.285 percent.
The greenback was steady at 119.23 yen, not far from its Tuesday high of 119.29, that was its strongest level since August 2007, when it rose as high as 119.84.
The euro was flat on the day at $1.2385.
The dollar's recent strength has weighed on spot gold which dipped 0.2 per cent to $1,196.30 an ounce on Wednesday.

Maruti Suzuki top pick in the auto sector  raises target price to Rs 3750: BofA-MLMaruti Suzuki
(The global investment bank…)
NEW DELHI: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd (MSIL) is the top pick in the India Auto sector and following sharp depreciation in Yen will lead to around 2 per cent rise in FY16E EPS, says BofA-ML.
The global investment bank who has a 'buy' rating on the counter raised its target price to Rs 3750, which translates into an upside of over 11 per cent from Tuesday's closing price of Rs 3,356.85.
At 11:39 am, the stock was at Rs 3,388.00; up 0.81 per cent, on the BSE.
For the year the stock has already rallied a little over 90 per cent.
BofA-ML raised their MSIL profit forecasts by 5 per cent each over FY16-17E, solely driven by revised EBITDA margin assumptions, even as their volume forecasts remain unaltered.
Following sharp depreciation in Yen, they have raised their EBITDA margin assumptions by 60bps/year to 13.6%-13.8%. They expect the company to partially pass on this benefit to customers in the form of higher incentives/ discounts.
Despite a muted recovery this fiscal year, MSIL has registered 13 per cent YTD growth thanks to strong petrol car demand and recent product successes, i.e. Celerio hatchback, Ciaz sedan.
BofA-ML expects gains to sustain and thereby retain their volume growth forecasts of 19 per cent in FY16E and 15 per cent in FY17E, driven by (1) better economic conditions and a favourable interest regime.

NEW DELHI: Tata Motors Ltd rallied as much as 1.6 per cent in trade on Wednesday, after its UK unit Jaguar Land Rover said that has started building its first fully-owned factory outside the United Kingdom in the Brazilian town of Itatiaia, near Rio de Janeiro.

"Our new facility in Brazil is an important strand of Jaguar Land Rover's long-term sustainability," AFP said quoting CEO Dr Ralf Speth, after the foundation stone was laid.
"The start of construction is a significant milestone and represents another step forward in our plans to create a truly global manufacturing footprint," said Speth.
He explained the company, owned by Indian giant Tata Motors, aimed to produce "vehicles that our customers in Brazil can love for life."

Shocked and hurt but not out: Gauahar Khan on slap attackComments
Most of us want reality TV star Gauhar Khan, who was recently slapped by an audience member for wearing a short dress while shooting India's Raw Star, to sdtand strong at the moment. And that is exactly what she is doing. "I thank my family, friends, fans, media, TV industry and film industry for all the love and support. I assure you all that I am hurt but not out. I am shocked but more determined. I felt injured but stronger than ever," the Bigg Boss 7 winner said.
Gauahar Khan
The attack happened on Sunday while Gauhar was hosting the finale of India's Raw Star. An audience member slapped her during the break of the show. He said that being a Muslim woman, the actress should not have worn a short dress. 
Khan expressed hopes that the man, identified as Mohammed Akil Mallick (24) and currently in police custody, will get punished for his violent behaviour. "This loser doesn't represent my beautiful faith which in itself means peace and submission. He apparently attacked me because I am an actress. He wanted to send out his warped message. I am using the same status to appeal to all women to stand against such acts."
Gauhar said despite her shock she did not let the incident spoil the finale of the show and completed her shoot. "I feel that pain of all women who go through any such attacks in the name of moral policing... I know this man does not represent the youth of India because the coward was outnumbered by the young boys who were outraged by his cowardly attack on me," she said.

Pak runs special trains  Imran Khan cancels rally for Hafiz Saeed meetPak runs special trains for Hafiz Saeed meet

In a sign of official patronage to Mumbai attacks mastermind Hafiz Saeed-led JuD, Pakistan government is running two special trains to transport people to Lahore for the terror group’s two-day congregation.
Jamaat-ud-Dawah chief Saeed told reporters on Tuesday that thousands of people would participate in the congregation starting on December 4 at the ground of Minar-i-Pakistan monument.
Pakistan Railways is operating the first train from Tuesday from Hyderabad, Sindh province, that will arrive in Lahore on Wednesday night.
Another train will leave from Karachi and arrive here on December 4. The two special trains will also take the people back to their hometowns on the conclusion of the congregation.
The JuD leadership had spoken to railways minister Saad Rafique for his permission to run special trains for its congregation, official sources told PTI.
Pakistan railways spokesperson Rauf Tahir said there had been a “uniform policy” to run special trains on the request of political and religious parties.
“The Railways has a uniform policy for everyone. Pay and hire a train. Two special trains will be run for JuD congregation but not free of cost,” he said.
In a related development, Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tahreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has also postponed its call to block Lahore on December 4 on the “request” of the JuD leadership.
“Yes, we have changed Lahore’s plan on the request of JuD.  The JuD told us that thousands of people are coming to Lahore on December 4 and it cannot afford any hurdle in it,” a senior PTI leader said on condition of anonymity.
Tightening its noose around Lashkar-e-Taiba, the US in June added its affiliates, including the JuD, to its list of designated terror organisations.
India has maintained that Saeed is the mastermind behind Mumbai terror attacks in 2008, conspiracy for which was hatched, planned and executed out of Pakistan.

After meeting PM Modi  Tripura CM says NDA government failed in adopting pro-people policies12
0
Agartala: A day after interacting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit to Tripura, Chief Minister Manik Sarkar called for a movement to press the NDA government for changing its outlook so that marginalised people could be benefitted.
Inaugurating a scheme of transfer of cash subsidy into bank account of consumers for purchasing mustard oil and pulses under Public Distribution System network here, Sarkar criticised the Centre for "not taking pro-people policy".
A movement was needed to press the NDA government at the Centre to change its outlook towards national policy so that marginalised people could be benefitted, Sarkar, also a politburo member of the CPI(M), said.
The scheme will be implemented in a quarterly basis where a beneficiary would receive Rs 105 in every three months.
#tripura #manik sarkar #nda #narendra modi
"The NDA government failed to keep its promise of adopting pro-people policy after coming to power. The BJP government did not attempt to curb the price hike of essential commodities. It rather took decisions for the sake of the capitalists in the country and abroad," Sarkar said.
In a rare meeting between the political right and the left, Modi interacted with Tripura's Marxist cabinet here at Sarkar's invitation and hailed the state's successful strategy in curbing the three-decade-old insurgency.
The Left Front government would try to provide subsidy to a few more essential commodities in future if adequate funds could be arranged, Sarkar said.
Minister for Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs, Bhanulal Saha said 65 per cent of beneficiaries have applied for the new scheme so far.
"As the state government cannot control price hike directly, the scheme is there to help the marginalised people to buy required food commodities," Saha said.
People under the PDS would be given cash subsidy of Rs 35 into their bank accounts in lieu of supply of one litre of mustard oil and two kg of pulses every month, he added.
The scheme will be implemented in a quarterly basis where a beneficiary would receive Rs 105 in every three months.

Rupee weakens to 61.92 on dollar demandRupee up 3 paise at 61.86
Our Bureau/PTI
Tweet
Mumbai, Dec 3:  
The rupee wiped off its early losses and was trading marginally strong at 61.86 against the dollar at 4.17 pm local time on mild dollar selling by exporters and banks.
After opening flat at 61.88 against the previous close of 61.89, the domestic unit hovered in the range of 61.84 and 61.95 in the afternoon trade.
The RBI kept the benchmark rates unchanged in the policy announcement yesterday but said it could cut the benchmark rates early next year provided inflationary pressures do not reappear and the Centre controls the fiscal deficit.
Forex dealers said apart from the gains in the dollar against other currencies in the global markets on impressive US data, fresh demand for the American unit from importers weighed on the rupee in early trade.
The rupee had gained 15 paise to close at 61.89 against the dollar in yesterday’s trade due to selling of the US currency by exporters and banks even as domestic markets ended lower.

Congress questions  culpable silence  of Modi on Sadhvi s remarksPM Narendra Modi speaks to Nawaz Sharif, says India stands firmly with Pak in fight against terror, offers all support
Congress questioned the “culpable silence” of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the controversial remarks by Union Minister Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti and suspected a political motive behind her utterances ahead of Delhi assembly polls.
“What is Narendra Modi’s stand on this? Why has he not condemned it so far? Before this, Giriraj Singh had also said such things and he was made a minister. Why is he (Modi) quiet? The issue is not only these two.
“The issue is the culpable silence of the Prime Minister within and outside Parliament on it,” party spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi told reporters here.
Wondering whether the Prime Minister has given “direct, indirect, approbation, support and endorsement” to these, Singhvi said “why is Modi running with the hare and hunting with the hound? Why is the monotonous regularity of such remarks before and around elections?”
The tough posture on the issue by Congress came after it was decided in a meeting of party leaders with Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, that the party should go on the offensive on issues like this.
Alleging that Uttar Pradesh was made the first laboratory of such politics in the run up to Lok Sabha polls by BJP, the Congress spokesperson said “has Delhi now also become a similar laboratory? In this context, he also drew attention to the fire in a church in the national capital.
Congress also raised the church burning issue in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.
Asking how can a central minister, appointed just a few days back, have the “temerity and gall” to say such a thing, he said adding a mere apology by her does not erase the “criminal culability” and hinted that some Congress leaders in individual capacity may also file criminal cases against her.
“Anybody can file an FIR and I am sure they will definitely do that,” Singhvi said but made it clear that it may not be by Congress as a party.
Asked whether Congress will resort to disruptions in the House even tomorrow over the issue, Singhvi said decisions are taken on a day-to-day basis but asserted “constructive opposition does not mean sleeping opposition. We will not shy away for a minute from raising our voice on such serious issues”.
Accusing the NDA government of practising “hyopcrisy and double standards”, Singhvi said “these are habitual offenders. We know what Giririaj Singh had said.
“He was rewarded after saying those things and made a Minister of State. Perhaps Modiji will make now make him a Cabinet minister after his second statement.”
Singhvi also targeted Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh’s government over the Maoist violence and took potshots at the central government for its U-turns on issues.
“The law and order in Chhattisgarh is deplorable to describe it in the mildest word. The state government, which is exclusively charged with the responsibility of security, is treating its citizes as canon fodder.
“Human lives from common man, security personnel to politcians, are endangered and more than 1400 security personnel have died between 2005 and 2008 in the state and in 2009 incidents. They are giving lame excuses. Nothing is being done. Empty statements from the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister won’t do. The nation wants to see results,” he said.
Reading a connect in all these incidents, Singhvi said “everywhere there is hypocrisy. They say what they do not mean and mean what they do not say. They cannot be trusted and can do anything to get cheap political gains. They care for cheap political and party interest at the cost of national interest.”
He charged “nobody had thought that we will have to hear such words in Delhi of 2014. Whether it is the issue of Chhattisgarh, remarks of Union Ministers like Jyoti or Singh or what we have said in the booklet, the larger canvass is that they are ready to jetisson national interest for cheap political interest”.

AAP turns tables on BJP over foreign fundsPM Narendra Modi speaks to Nawaz Sharif, says India stands firmly with Pak in fight against terror, offers all support
Hitting back at Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on the party funding issue, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) alleged that the saffron party received 75 per cent of its funds from unknown sources and also accepted donations from a Goa based businessman, whose name cropped up in a black money case.
“It is a classic case of pot calling the kettle black, in which the party which has three-fourth of its donations from hidden sources is levelling absurd allegations on AAP, which has introduced the concept of transparent political funding in the country,” Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Yogendra Yadav said.
The party is filing a criminal defamation suit against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) , which has alleged that AAP was diverting funds from NGOs of its leaders. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) also alleged that Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has not disclosed the names of its donors.
“Is it not a fact that on March 29 this year, the Delhi High Court found Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) guilty of receiving foreign funds in violation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act? Is it not a fact that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has accepted donations of Rs 1.18 crore from the owner of Goa-based private company, who was recently named by the central government in its list of black money account holders abroad?” he alleged.
The AAP leader also claimed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) accepted donations from another foreign company.
“Is it not a fact that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) received Rs 19,42,50,000 as foreign funds between 2004 and 2012 and can it deny that 75 per cent of its donations come from unknown sources?” Yadav alleged.
He asked Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to prove its “motivated” and “uninformed” allegations and AAP was ready for any probe by any agency in the matter.
Party chief and former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has also challenged BJP to disclose the list of their donors as his party has done and accused the saffron party of “terrorising” those who have donated money to Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).
He also took a jibe at the media for “arbitrary coverage” of the allegations levelled by the ruling party.
“Media has widely covered arbitrary and baseless allegations by BJP against our funding. We are filing criminal defamation against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) .
“I have been challenging Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress to disclose their list of donors (the way we do). Would media give similar coverage to us? For the first time, a political party (is) trying transparent funding n disclosing its list of donors. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) trying to terrorise our donors. Fair?” the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief wrote on micro-blogging website Twitter.
Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had organised lunch for traders, with an entry fee of Rs 20,000. The party collected a whopping sum of Rs 50 lakh.
In a similar event held in Mumbai last Thursday, the party had fetched Rs 91 lakh, taking the total to Rs 1.41 crore in just two such events.

I was raped at 19: Lady GagaBy: Press Trust of India | Los Angeles |
Posted: December 3, 2014 10:31 am
Pop sensation Lady Gaga has revealed that she was raped as a teenager and she went through emotional therapy to recover from the incident. During a candid interview with Howard Stern, Gaga, 28, recalled how she was sexually assaulted when she was around 19-years-old, but she only spoke of the incident now because she does not want “to be defined by it”, reported Us magazine.
“I went through some horrific things that I’m able to laugh (at) now, because I’ve gone through a lot of mental and physical therapy and emotional therapy to heal over the years. “My music’s been wonderful for me. But, you know, I was a shell of my former self at one point. I was not myself. To be fair, I was about 19. I went to Catholic school and then all this crazy stuff happened, and I was going, ‘Oh, is this just the way adults are?'” she said.
Gaga said that she did not divulge information about the assault before because she did not want the attacker to receive any credit for her motivation to succeed.

Paris Hilton gets death threats and anti-Semitic messagesBy: Press Trust of India | Los Angeles |

Socialite Paris Hilton has been targeted by an anti-Semitic man who has sent her death threats and believes she is Jewish.
The hotel heiress, who was raised a Roman Catholic, and her father Rick have both been targeted by a guy on Instagram and Facebook who has posted several abusive and anti-Semitic messages to the pair, repoerted TMZ.
The guy is also alleged to have threatened to sexually assault the 33-year-old star. The Los Angeles Police Department has obtained a warrant to try to track down the man on the social media sites and believe they know who he is.
It’s not the first time Paris has been hit with death threats as in May 2007 she was sentenced to a 45-day jail term and before the stretch was due to start in June that year she was said to be inundated with threats from inmates.

Bradley Cooper worried about gaining weight naturally for filmBy: Press Trust of India | London |

Actor Bradley Cooper says he had to gain weight naturally, without supplements, to portray a Navy Seal in Clint Eastwood’s new movie.
The ‘American Hustle’ star, who plays the real-life hero Chris Kyle in ‘American Sniper’, said he feared his past struggles with addiction would come back to haunt him if he started popping pills, reported Contactmusic. “I did it naturally because I’ve been sober for 10 years and didn’t want to do anything.”
“I had a realistic conversation: ‘Can I do this in three months naturally? Can I gain 30 pounds of muscle?’ I didn’t know if I would be able to do it or not. Thank God, luckily, my body reacted fast,” he said.

50 Cents bank account frozenBy: Press Trust of India | Los Angeles |
Posted: December 3, 2014 10:16 am
Rapper 50 Cent reportedly cannot draw any money from his bank account after it was frozen. The 39-year-old rapper had his personal account frozen because he failed to pay USD 17.2 million in judgment to Sleek Audio after he lost a lawsuit against the company earlier this year.
A source additionally said the rap mogul still had access to his business accounts, reported TMZ. Headphone company Sleek Audio previously claimed the rapper stole their design and promoted it with SMS Audio. A judge then decided that Cent should pay the company for the damages as well as the legal fees. An attorney for 50 Cent has responded to the story that the account was frozen.
The attorney said that they were filing an appeal against Sleek Audio. The attorney also commented that the manufacturer was “desperately attempting” to get money from his client. The rapper’s legal team also gave confirmation that his assets were “appropriately protected”.

Oil rebounds 1 per cent after sharp losses; US data supports

(Brent crude hit a high of…)
SINGAPORE: Oil rose more than 1 per cent on Wednesday with Brent climbing above $71 a barrel, recovering slightly from losses in the prior session as a turbulent market struggled to find a price floor.
The market has swung between sharp gains and losses since OPEC said last week that it would maintain steady output in an oversupplied market. Brent and US crude are down more than 30 per cent since June and touched five-year lows on Monday.
Brent hit a high of $71.46 a barrel before trading up 62 cents at $71.16 by 0350 GMT, after falling $2 on Tuesday.
US crude was at $67.68 a barrel, off the day's high of $67.97 but up 80 cents from the previous session when prices dropped more than $2.
American Petroleum Institute data showing a bigger-than-expected fall in crude stocks supported US oil prices.
"The market's volatility is a result of people working out what's going to happen next," said Jonathan Barratt, chief investment officer at Ayers Alliance Securities.
"Prices should find a volatile low at these levels" given that Russia, hurt by a drop in oil revenues, may act to prop up prices, he added.
OPEC's oil supply fell by 340,000 barrels per day (bpd) in November as a recovery in Libya faltered, a Reuters survey found, although a lack of deliberate cutbacks by Saudi Arabia and other key members underlines their focus on defending market share .
The Kingdom would only consider cutting production if other countries, including non-OPEC producer Russia, joined in limits, former Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki bin Faisal said.
Chart analysts, however, warned that the months-long rout is not over yet and US crude may quickly plunge towards $50 per barrel if a handful of tenuous support levels give way after a period of consolidation.
In the United States , crude inventories fell by 6.5 million barrels in the week to Nov. 28 to 373 million, according to API, versus analyst expectations for an increase of 1.3 million barrels.
Data from the US Energy Information Administration is due on Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. EST (1530 GMT).
"Although winter demand for crude oil could cause inventories to drop more than expected, we expect production to remain strong," analysts at Phillips Futures in Singapore said in a note.

Live: Final farewell for Phillip Hughes  tearful Clarke pays rich tribute at funeral serviceFinal farewell to Phillip Hughes, Clarke pays poignant tribute
AFP
print
Cricketing greats bid an emotional farewell to Phillip Hughes at a funeral service in his home town Wednesday, as Australia stopped to remember the batsman whose death from a freak injury sent shockwaves through the sport.
A lone cricket bat rested against the coffin at a packed service in his former high school hall in Macksville on the New South Wales coast in front of his heartbroken parents, family and friends and a shattered Australian Test team.
"Taken from the game, his family and loved ones at the age of just 25, left a mark on our game that needs no embellishment," tearful captain Michael Clarke told the funeral. "I don't know about you but I keep looking for him."
Hughes, who had played 26 Tests and was on the cusp of a recall, died from bleeding on the brain last Thursday after being hit on the base of the skull by a rising ball at the Sydney Cricket Ground during a domestic match.
His tragic death stunned Australia, where cricket is considered the national game, and prompted a rescheduling of the upcoming India Test series, while fans around the world placed bats outside their front doors as a mark of respect.
Clarke said he walked to the middle of the SCG on Thursday night: "Those same blades of grass beneath my feet where he and I and so many of his mates here today have built partnerships, taken chances and lived out the dreams we painted in our heads as boys.
"I stood there at the wicket, I knelt down and touched the grass, I swear he was with me... Telling me we just needed to dig in and get through to tea," he added.
 
'We must play on'
 
Clarke said the tributes offered from sports stars and fans across the globe had sustained him, from a little girl holding a candle in tribute, to masters of the game such as Sachin Tendulkar expressing sorrow.
"This is what makes our game the greatest game in the world. We must dig in and get through to tea. And we must play on," he added.
"So rest in peace my little brother. I will see you out in the middle."
In Hughes' small hometown of Macksville, on Australia's east coast, tributes to the opening batsman hung in shop windows, while ribbons in the green and gold colours of the Australian Test team adorned telephone poles.
Macksville itself, with a population of just 2,500, welcomed greats such as Shane Warne, Brian Lara, Glenn McGrath, Virat Kohli and Hughes' first Test skipper Ricky Ponting.
Sean Abbott, the young man who bowled the fast ball which struck Hughes, also attended supported by his parents, as did Prime Minister Tony Abbott.
Tony Abbott said there had been profound grief, in part because to "be felled by a hard but fair ball in the centre of the SCG at your most exuberant, it just doesn't seem right or natural".
 
'Spirit of cricket'
Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland said over the past week the nation and the sporting world had reeled in shock.
"Yet even within that profound sense of loss the spirit of cricket has shone through the darkness," he told the gathering.
Hughes' parents Greg and Virginia and siblings invited the whole town to the service at Macksville High School, where about 1,000 crammed into the hall and hundreds more watched on screens in overflow areas.
The funeral was a huge event in Macksville, with shops closing and residents in mourning. Just outside town, one business created a huge tribute using three cherry pickers as cricket stumps and putting Hughes' Test number 408 across them.
At Hughes's old primary school, St Patrick's, dozens of bats lined the front fence, many bearing messages remembering the hugely popular opener who was not out on 63 when he was struck.
As a summer storm threatened after a hot day, hundreds walked along the street behind the hearse carrying Hughes's coffin, some nodding their heads, others applauding, out of respect for the cricketer.
Hughes died after his vertebral artery split when hit by the ball, leading to massive bleeding in his brain.

BSE Sensex recovers over 60 points in early trade on global cuesDirect equity set to top FDs as biggest asset class in FY15: Report
The benchmark BSE Sensex slipped by 46.58 points in morning trade today as bourses turned wavery on bouts of selling in key bluechips from IT, tech, healthcare and FMCG sectors.
Earlier, the market recovered from its overnight losses amid firm buying in realty, capital goods, banking, consumer durables, metal and oil & gas sector stocks coupled with shares of mid-cap and small-cap companies.
Higher Asian cues amid overnight gains in US stocks along with FII inflows overlapped the market sentiment.
The 30-share index opened higher at 28,472.32 and fluctuated between 28,504.65 and 28,370.73 before quoting 28,397.43 points at 1100 hours.
It was down by 46.58 points, or 0.16 per cent, over its previous close.

Fast  faster  fastest: This cheetah robot can run at 16 kphAP
A robotic cheetah runs on an athletic field at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.
It’s a robot unlike any other, inspired by the world’s fastest land animal and controlled by video game technology.
The robot, called the cheetah, can run on batteries at speeds of more than 16 kph, jump about 40 centimetres high, land safely and continue running for at least 15 minutes all while using less power than a microwave oven.
It’s the creation of researchers at the Massachusetts of Technology (MIT), who had to design key elements from zero because of a lack of, or shortcomings in, existing technology.
That includes powerful, lightweight motors, electronics that control power for its 12 motors and an algorithm that determines the amount of force a leg should exert during the split second that it spends on the ground while running. That’s the key to helping the robot maintain balance and forward momentum.
An onboard computer organises data from various sensors and sends commands to each motor.
To be used in search and rescue ops
“This is kind of a Ferrari in the robotics world, like, we have to put all the expensive components and make it really that instinctive,” said MIT Professor Sangbae Kim, who heads the school’s Biomimetic Robotics Lab that designed the robot. “That’s the only way to get that speed.”
Insight gleaned from the prototype could have real-world applications, including the design of revolutionary prosthetics, wearable technologies, all-terrain wheelchairs and vehicles that can travel efficiently in rough terrain much like animals do, Professor Kim said. There are hopes the robot will be able to be used in search and rescue operations in hazardous or hostile environments where it’s too risky to send a human rescuer.
“When the robot is running, at every step, we calculate the appropriate amount of the force to the legs so that the robot can balance itself,” said MIT research scientist Hae-Won Park, who wrote the complex algorithm used to control the cheetah, which weighs around 31 kilograms about the same as one of its female feline counterparts.
Crafting the cheetah robot took five years of work and plenty of confidence to ignore those who said electric motors aren’t strong enough to propel a running mechanical cheetah powered by batteries.
Researchers continue to tweak their prototype, looking to add additional sensors that would eventually make the robot autonomous.
“In the next 10 years, our goal is we are trying to make this robot to save a life,” Professor Kim said.

Gujarat Pipavavs EBITDA growth to taperoffDirect equity set to top FDs as biggest asset class in FY15: Report
Since takeover by the multinational APM Terminals (43% stake), Gujarat Pipavav (GPPL) has witnessed a remarkable turnaround. EBITDA is up 34x in the past seven years.
But EBITDA growth will liekly taper off from 43% p.a. (CY12-14) to 23% p.a. (CY14-17) to 12% p.a. (CY17+). GPPL’s tariff growth to taper off to 6% per annum from 14% p.a. in CY12-14, in line with industry as it is now close to Mundra tariffs. We believe GPPL will focus on improvement in utilisation as its capacity expands 35% over the next 2 years
GPPL will reach peak utilization of 95% in 5 years with no capex beyond that as the concession period will end in CY28. Renewal of concession at similar terms is not guaranteed. In our view, takeover by government or aggressive bids by competitors is a possibility post 2028.
We believe CMP is factoring in more than cash flows from full utilisation of current and planned capacity. While scalability is not an issue, we believe massive value accretive capex is unlikely. If next round of capex starts by CY18, GPPL will have 8-9 years to reap benefits. In case of renewal of concession, terms may be less lucrative.

Ravens Pushed Janay Rice To Apologize After Attackreddit
Janay Rice claims it was not her idea to apologize after being the victim in a domestic violence incident involving her husband. The wife of free agent NFL running back Ray Rice told Matt Lauer of "Today" that the Baltimore Ravens "suggested" that she apologize during a press conference in May .
Janay Rice revealed that she would not have apologized -- or even participated in the press conference -- had the Ravens not proposed the idea. The first segment of the interview aired Monday, just days after Ray Rice's indefinite suspension from the NFL was overturned by an arbitrator. Candy Palmer, Janay Rice's mother, joined her daughter for this portion of the interview:
Matt Lauer: And did anyone at the Ravens say, "Janay, it would be really good if you issue some kind of an apology?"
Janay Rice: They suggested it, yes.
Lauer: Did they come up with the wording?
Rice: No, not specifically. They basically gave us a general script.
Lauer: That really started it.
Rice: And that was frustrating for me because, obviously, people took it as I'm taking light off of what Ray did. In no way.
Candy Palmer: Or you're giving him an excuse.
Rice: Yeah. No, not at all. I was basically, not doing what I was told, but at the same time I didn't think it was completely wrong for me to apologize, because at the end of the day, I got arrested too. I did something wrong too. Not taking any light off what Ray did because I agree with everybody else, it was wrong.
Lauer: The Ravens tweeted out that portion of that statement, your apology, and then they quickly took it down, because I think they understood very fast the reaction to that apology. Do you think the reaction was warranted from people around the country.
Rice: I completely understood it. Which was frustrating because the whole thing was just awkward, to be honest.
Lauer: But had it not been for the Ravens, urging you or suggesting you apologize, you would have never been at that press conference and you would have never apologized.
Rice: No. No.
In an interview with ESPN's Jemele Hill, Janay Rice also indicated that the Ravens had provided a "suggested script" for the press conference. In an as-told-to piece , published on Nov. 28, she reflected on the press conference:
Looking out over the media, I became angry, seeing all the people who had been covering this and adding to the story. I wanted to tell everyone what was really on my mind. When it was my turn to speak, I said I regretted my role in the incident. I know some people disagreed with me publicly apologizing. I'm not saying that what Ray did wasn't wrong. He and I both know it was wrong. It's been made clear to him that it was wrong. But at the same time, who am I to put my hands on somebody? I had already apologized to Ray, and I felt that I should take responsibility for what I did. Even though this followed the Ravens' suggested script, I owned my words.
While live-tweeting the May press conference, the official Ravens Twitter account highlighted the apology from Janay Rice. The tweet appeared to be deleted by the Ravens after Ray Rice was released by the team in September. The team released Ray Rice just hours after the graphic video of him striking Janay was made public. The incident occurred in February at a casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The NFL had levied a two-game suspension in July, before upgrading Rice's punishment to an indefinite ban, after TMZ released the video from inside the elevator.

InMobi raises $5 million from SoftBank, looks to woo more investors

(The focus for the Bangalore-based…)
BENGALURU: Mobile ad network InMobi has raised $5 million (Rs 31 crore) from its high-profile investor SoftBank, with the Japanese company promising another $25 million if new investors come on board, three people familiar with the matter said.
The focus for the Bangalore-based company is to become profitable to attract new investors, as it also aims to make an initial public offering in the next two years. "Talks with new investors are on, but the company is looking to hit profitability in two months," said one of the people.
Manish Dugar, who heads the finance and legal division at InMobi, said Soft-Bank's investment had come four months ago and the amount was "significantly higher" than $5 million.
"SoftBank has said that if new investors come in, they would like to make a pro-rata investment to maintain their stake," said Dugar, even as he denied any specific conditions that the Internet and telecom giant has put in to invest more money. "It is for us to decide whether we want the money or not from SoftBank," he said, adding that the company would go for an initial public offering in oneand-half to two years.
SoftBank, which owns one-third of In-Mobi, did not respond to an email seeking comment.
While $5 million may not be a large sum, it could be a necessary step to getting newer investors on the board, say experts. "If a large investor like SoftBank is not excited about the business prospect, it becomes a big signaling issue for newer ones," said an investment banker who did not wish to be identified. "It is better than not having anything." But InMobi says things are looking bright after all.
"We have never been as close to profitability as we were in October — we were almost breaking even," said Dugar, who joined the company in June last year. "Our November financials are looking amazingly good."
The mobile ad network had earlier told ET that it was likely to hit profitability in November and December on a month-onmonth basis. It signed up five customers in October who will annually contribute $35 million in run rate — a metric that uses the most recent data to estimate future performance. SoftBank has recently been on a shopping spree in India. With $10 billion at its disposal, it pumped in $627 million in Snapdeal and $210 million in taxi-hailing firm Ola Cabs.
InMobi had raised $15.1 million from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Ram Shriram's Sherpalo Ventures in two rounds in 2008 and 2010. SoftBank followed that up with a $200 million round in 2011.
The seven-year-old company, which started as mobile-search engine mKhoj , now has an outreach to 872 million unique devices around the world.
Over the last three years, the company has evolved to better target its ads in different formats such as banner, video and native. Over the past few months it has also rolled out a slew of products aimed at engaging deeply with developers and advertisers alike.
Dugar said the company was looking at a valuation which was much larger than $1 billion. Currently, InMobi's board comprises representatives from the three investors and two cofounders. Jaswinder "JP" Singh, faculty at Princeton University, represents Sherpalo Ventures, while Atsushi Taira represents SoftBank and Michael Abbott represents Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield and Byers. From the founders' side, CEO Naveen Tewari occupies a permanent seat while the remaining three co-founders - Amit Gupta, Mohit Saxena and Abhay Singhal - occupy the fifth seat on a rotational basis.
The profit margin for an ad network is usually around 15-20%, according to International Market Analysis Research and Consulting Group.
"They have reached their peak. Unless they want to continue on that streak, they need to do something more and diversify," said Neha Dharia, research analyst at Ovum. Dugar said revenue over the last three years has grown nine times and the company has managed to cut down costs by bringing in a lot of automation of process and adjusting people by location. "We are currently at a run rate of $1.5 million a day and we aspire to reach $2 million by the time we reach December," he said.

Used luxury and supercar market on a rollUsed luxury car market on a roll as duties make imported supercars highly expensive
By Ketan Thakkar , ET Bureau | 2 Dec, 2014, 07.00AM IST
Tweet
It’s a win-win for both buyers and sellers. These cars, usually rarely driven, are available in immaculate condition and prices that are much cheaper than a brand new one.
MUMBAI: Are you one of those longing for a supercar but is held back by import duty that equals the vehicle's price? Checking out the used-car market may solve the problem.
The steep tax, which was raised to 100 per cent from 60 per cent some years ago for vehicles imported as fully built units, and the rupee's depreciation over the period have swelled the cost of acquiring a supercar by 75-100 per cent, giving rise to a thriving secondhand market in India for cars like the Lamborghini, Ferrari , Rolls Royce and Bentley .
It's a win-win for both buyers and sellers. These cars, usually rarely driven, are available in immaculate condition and prices that are much cheaper than a brand new one. The seller who bought it when the local currency was stronger and import tax lower, can usually get the price he paid for buying it, or at times, even more.
"I had a budget of Rs 2 crore, but I didn't mind spending an extra Rs 50 lakh," said a real-estate businessman in Mumbai, who bought a secondhand Lamborghini Gallardo for Rs 2.5 crore. A brand new Gallardo would have cost Rs 1 crore more, he said, asking not to be named.
The Lamborghini Gallardo he bought was as good as new. It was driven for merely 3,000 kms and was impeccably maintained.
While the high duty and weak rupee have driven up the secondhand market in India, that for new supercars is expected to shrink to half to about 115-120 units in 2014 when compared to 200 units in 2010-11. According to industry experts, a similar number of used super-luxury cars are changing hands now, often facilitated by their dealers.
"We have facilitated about 20 such car purchase in 2013 and the number is more or less the same in 2014," said Sharad Kachalia, the Rolls Royce dealer in Mumbai.
"Since the new car is available at over 75-100 per cent price difference, over the last two years, a prospective buyer is able to get a relatively new but used car at almost 25-30 per cent benefit for both buyer and seller," said a dealer of used super-luxury cars, who asked not to be named.
The phenomenon is having a favourable impact on effective depreciation for the owners, because the value of the vehicles hasn't gone down as much as they can account for in the books, and on occasions has risen.
A Mumbai businessman who bought himself a Lamborghini Gallardo at Rs 2.9 crore a few years back, in a normal course after depreciation, the value of the car in 2014 should have been Rs 1.74 crore, but he could fetch Rs 2.51 crore from a buyer in Karnataka in October this year.
"I had sparsely used the vehicle for 1,400-1,500 kms and I got to know about the new Huracan and that seemed an interesting buy. So, I sold off my Gallardo," said this businessman requesting anonymity. "It has been an advantage for anyone who bought a CBU around 2011-12 at older custom duty. I am very satisfied with the price I got."
Pavan Shetty, head of operations at Lamborghini India, explained the actual depreciation in resale is as low as 25 per cent over a two-year period wherein the accounting standards in India allow a depreciation of 40 per cent over the same period for automobiles.
"While the above scenario is true in routine purchase, the rich who realised their passion before duty hike have benefitted even more with a depreciation of just 20 per cent over a three-year period where as in their books, the car would have depreciated by 60 per cent," Shetty said. "This segment clearly defies the myth that luxury cars depreciate faster and in fact brands like Lamborghini have turned out to be an asset quite literally."
Demand for used luxury supercars is high not just because of the current duty structures, but also because customers are looking to reduce their risk taking with their first supercars, said Rohin Nagrani, senior editor at Motoring World magazine.
"Cars which sold for Rs 3.2-3.4 crore, new in 2011-12, now retail for anywhere between Rs 3.5 crore and Rs 4 crore, depending on their usage. And this is for a car that doesn't enjoy factory support at the moment," Nagrani said. "New cars are finding this rather tough. A brand new Rolls-Royce Phantom has been lying with a dealer for the last 16 months for want of a buyer, simply because customers find the Rs 7-8 crore price tag daunting. The same car just 3-4 years would cost a customer under Rs 5 crore."
Experts caution that the boom time may not last long. Things may fall in line once there is stability in duty rate. But, as long as there is an artificial difference, both buyers and sellers can have a good time in a market which may have about 1,500-2,000 cars plying on the roads, bought in the last decade or so.

Maruti  Hyundai  Toyota  Honda lead car sales pickup in NovemberMaruti, Hyundai, Toyota, Honda lead car sales pickup in November

Led by Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai Motor, Honda Motor and Toyota Motor, automakers have likely dispatched more cars in November over the 1.42 lakh cars sold a year earlier.

Prices | Financials | Company Info | Reports
NEW DELHI: Car sales in India are set to return to the positive territory after a two-month gap, with the top four companies that account for 70% of the local market recording healthy numbers in November.
Led by Maruti Suzuki , Hyundai Motor, Honda Motor and Toyota Motor , automakers have likely dispatched more cars in November over the 1.42 lakh cars sold a year earlier, initial data issued by the companies show.
Final numbers will be available only later in the month, when industry body Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers declares sales.
With the November gains, industry executives expect year-over-year sales to rise 9-10% in the past month.
Car sales had been sluggish for more than two years, and after a temporary recovery from May to August in the current fiscal year, they slipped back again during the crucial festive months of September and October.
New launches and declining fuel prices, along with an improving consumer sentiment, are the likely factors that are again pushing the sales higher. Also, discounts have peaked after the festival season.
According to the data shared by carmakers, Maruti's domestic sales increased 17% to 1,00,024 units, while the local unit of Hyundai posted a 6% gain at 35,511 cars. At Honda Cars India, volume jumped as much as 64% to 15,263 units in November. At 12,175 units, Bangalore-based Toyota Kirloskar Motor's sales rose 19% from November last year.
"We benefitted from the strong investment by Hyundai to launch four new products in the past one year," said Rakesh Srivastava, senior VP for marketing and sales at Hyundai Motors. "The greatest impetus came from the splendid demand for the all new Elite i20 which has reached a landmark number of 10,500 units and is the largest selling Hyundai brand in the Indian market."
Companies had been launching new cars in quick succession to attract customers. Over the past few weeks, several new brands and products like Maruti Alto K10, Honda Mobilio, Tata Zest and Mercedes-Benz C-Class have reinvigorated the market. With the help of Zest, Tata Motors managed to post 16% growth in sales in car and utility vehicle sales after a year-long declining streak. The company said sales of its cars — Zest and Nano — jumped 30% on-year in November.
But the growth trend could be temporary as several players continued to decline with high interest rates keeping many prospective buyers away and some old models failing to take buyers.
Mahindra & Mahindra, the top SUV manufacturer, posted an 18% drop in sales as the company failing to captalise on its newly launched Scorpio to return to the positive territory.
"The auto industry continues to see sluggish demand on the back of factors such as low consumer sentiments and high interest rates. We do expect some cushioning from reducing international crude prices. While the possibility of current excise duty rates to go beyond the December deadline could also help in the much needed recovery for the auto industry," said Pravin Shah, CEO for the automotive division & international operations at Mahindra.

Maruti recalls 3 796 units of mid-sized sedan Ciaz to fix clutch partPrices | Financials | Company Info | Reports
NEW DELHI: Maruti Suzuki, India's largest carmaker, said on Monday that it would recall 3,796 units of its recently-launched sedan Ciaz to replace a faulty clutch, terming the move as a "service campaign" to minimise inconvenience to customers. Maruti Suzuki said the exercise will cover variants of Ciaz that were made till November 7 in the exercise announced on Monday.
The company will start inspecting cars for suspected faults and will possibly replace parts of the master cylinder in the clutch that it said was not functioning as per the desired parameter. Maruti Suzuki dealers have started informing owners about the service campaigns to rectify the fault.
The carmaker said that it is conducting this campaign in the interest of customers. "Service campaigns are undertaken globally by automobile companies to rectify faults that may potentially cause inconvenience to customers. It's not a recall and we are taking a proactive step in this direction," a company spokesperson said.
Maruti Suzuki had launched the Ciaz in both petrol and diesel variants, with an introductory price offer between Rs 6.99 lakh and Rs 9.8 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi) on October 6 this year. The company did not specify how many units of the Ciaz had been sold till date.

"Dumb" DD anchor on IFFI viral video: I have felt suicidal lately; don t know where I m headedWritten by Parmita Uniyal | New Delhi |
Posted: December 2, 2014 12:17 pm | Updated: December 2, 2014 4:15 pm
Nervous, confused, misinformed – a DD anchor was termed “dumb” by social media recently, as she made one blunder after the other, while covering IFFI (International Film Festival of India) at Goa. While very few might have noticed her at the event and even fewer on television, a video clip posted online went viral.
Aayenah Pahuja, the anchor in question, spoke to Logical Indian, to clear the air as to “what went wrong on that day”.
“By now all of you know me as a dumb DD anchor. It might be entertaining for you guys, but it’s very depressing for me and lately I have felt suicidal because my career is at stake; my contracts, assignment have been snatched away from me,” Pahuja says in a video interview with Logical Indian.
;
“I am not here to defend myself or neither am I here to blame somebody, but to tell you the truth,” she said. “First of all, the other day what happened was I was not made to rehearse thoroughly, then I did not know most of the dignitaries present at this prestigious event. Five minutes before the event started, the instruction mike stopped working. Producer did not have any way to tell me who’s coming next, that was one big mistake. Yes, I did make mistake. I apologise for the same,” she says.
Pahuja had also introduced Mridula Sinha, the governor of Goa as the “governor of India”.
She clarifies – “The governor of India wasn’t intentional, but I was nervous at that point of time and it was a slip of tongue. There was a massive technical crash out there.”
In the end of the video, she makes an appeal to web surfers – “Mere saath jo ho gaya, ho gaya, aap hanste rahoge, mera mazaak ban chuka hai. Aane waale future mein koi ladke-ladki ke saath aisa ho, to harsh mat hona.” (Whatever had to happen to me has happened. I have become a butt of jokes. In the future, please spare boys or girls who commit a similar blunder. Don’t be harsh to them)
“My career is at stake I don’t know where I’m headed now,” she signs off.

Startups like CommonFloor, Ola Cabs, Housing and others bank on senior executives for expertise to get a headstart

(A chartered accountant…)
BENGALURU: The young and the restless with the urge to kick off something big are fuelling India's startup ecosystem. But if the idea takes off, such ventures need more experienced hands to nurture dreams into businesses with respectable valuations.
Corporate executives typically come to the rescue of such infant companies with domain knowledge, managerial expertise and networks, along with experience of scale, structure, systems and processes from large companies which they apply to accelerate the growth curve of startups.
CommonFloor.com, Ola Cabs , Housing .com and Wingify are among companies that have hired senior executives.
Mitesh Shah is one of them. A chartered accountant with 12 years of post-qualification experience in corporate finance and strategic management, he joined Ola as chief financial officer a year ago.
He's well versed in areas ranging from fundraising and financial management to going public and corporate governance practices.
"What I was doing in my later years there (previous jobs), I bring to Ola in its early years now as my expertise," he said. Ola has also hired professionals for corporate affairs, public policy, marketing and category management among others.
"We look for people who have a shared vision in shaping something futuristic and have done it in their own," said Bhavish Aggarwal, co-founder and CEO, Ola Cabs.
How do startups find the right senior manager. Look for the right spark, suggested Krishna Tanuku , executive director, Indian School of Business, Hyderabad.
"Indian entrepreneurs should look at someone who has aspirations of becoming an entrepreneur," he said. Shah, for instance, said Ola gave him the opportunity to build something from the ground up.
"Execution is key in startup environments. The time taken from ideation to implementation is little and there's a lot of learning in being able to do multiple things at that speed," he said.Online real estate portal CommonFloor.com brought in the older guys last year after expanding to 18 cities in India, raising significant funding and reaching an employee base of 500 since its launch in 2007.
"The scope of the problem was growing and part of a founder's job is to ensure people are aligned to the same vision.
When you become big, you can't afford to make too many mistakes, so you need people who know more about particular aspects and so you can then put their expertise in a particular area," said Sumit Jain, co-founder and CEO, CommonFloor.com.
Property portal Housing.com, founded by 12 IIT Bombay graduates in June 2012, needed handholding in some areas, even basic ones such as registering a company. After raising the first round of funding, they felt the need for supervision.
"We suddenly realised that a great product is the first step to create a great company. There are many more parts that have to be put in place to build a company that lasts for hundreds of years," said Advitiya Sharma, co-founder and board member, Housing.com.
"While our investors and advisors have helped us take key decisions (like buying the Housing. com domain etc.), we have always believed in getting people better than us to do work that makes everyone in the company feel proud."
The key is getting the balance right said Tanuku of ISB.
"Young entrepreneurs have energy, enthusiasm, personal commitment but less experience in dynamics of industry impacting business," said Tanuku.
"Companies that start with great ideas need to be mixed with practical experience and exposure--no single individual can bring it altogether.
It's important for entrepreneurs to lean on professional expertise as early in the journey."
The benefits of such experience are evident at Delhi-based Wingify. It has doubled its annual revenue run rate to $8 million in the last year since hiring Tejaswi Chawla as vice president of global sales.
Chawla expanded the sales team from two to 16 and brought in people with relevant experience at established companies.
"She was responsible for changing our sales culture from reactive to proactive selling," said Paras Chopra, founder and CEO of Wingify, realising that even the best product need to be marketed.
The company now sells in geographies such as Japan, Australia, and Singapore .
"If I had to do this without hiring a VP sales with a good network it would have been difficult. With Tejaswi on board, people took it as proof that the startup has potential," said Chopra. Investors are often involved in hiring senior talent.

BENGALURU: Bengaluru-based Indian Institute of Science is looking for ways to foster entrepreneurship, sifting through its intellectual property amassed over 105 years of academic excellence in research and tapping into its faculty and alumni to create more start-ups.
"The emphasis on science research will not change, but we are interested in making it more impactful," said IISc director Anurag Kumar. "We will have several programmes that are translational," he said. Translational programmes aim to take research and make it ready for use in the real world.
"For research to be beneficial to the society you have to create more products and services. So such translational work needs to happen," said Kris Gopalakrishnan , co-founder of India's second largest software exporter Infosys , who recently made a Rs 225-crore grant to set up the Centre for Brain Research at IISc.
The institution is also raising a micro fund of about Rs 20 crore - partly backed by the government, philanthropists and alumni - to back start-ups that it selects to incubate in its campus. "It will take us about six months to give it shape," said CS Murali, chairman of Entrepreneurship Cell and the Society for Innovation and Development at IISc.
Gopalakrishnan said: "I'd like to see more and more professors and venture funds supporting businesses coming out of research."

Srini first took the help of Lalit Modi (RCA), Arun Jaitley (DDCA) and a few others and formed the IPL which was a commercial entity (not a charitable body like BCCI). Significant funds have moved to the IPL, thereby BCCI showing a loss (because there is no salary for these interested parties) and IPL getting all revenues (from which these guys paid big money to themselves, and their appointees in the name of directors, managers, coaches, strategists and what not). Now Supreme Court has caught him (and others similarly having CoI) on the wrong foot and he is trying to wriggle out in one way or the other.
I honestly wish and hope the SC will direct all politicians and businessmen to stay out of cricket boards and associations. This includes Jaitley, Anurag Thakur, Amit Shah etc; and crickters like Bishan Bedi, Wadekar, Sivaramakrishnan etc should take over.

The value proposition that CA Technologies brings to the CIOs today is agilityConcerted effort to manipulate machinery: Court in coal case
CA Technologies, a global software firm that offers solutions ranging from planning to DevOps to security and systems management, recently conducted a global study that highlighted that majority of Indian enterprises are affected by the Application Economy. The study also reveals that 52% of Indian respondents plan to adopt DevOps in the next two years to address the growing application demand. In an interview to India media personnel in Singapore, Kenneth Arredondo, President & General Manager, Asia Pacific & Japan at CA Technologies said that Application economy presents huge opportunity for the firm and that India remains one of the focus market for them. Excerpts:
How has the whole approach towards software development changed in recent years?
The game is definitely changing a lot. Software till about 15-20 years ago, the expectation was that you buy it, it would take a year or two to implement it, there would be bugs, you paid consultants who would come in and fix it and then integrate and so on. The expectations now are much more about instant gratification, expectation is everything works out of box, but the tradeoff is that everything is plain vanilla – what you are buying is probably 80% of that you would have purchased earlier. The tradeoff today is that between speed and features, and the choice depends on what’s more important to an individual organization. However the standards remain the same — that is the pressure to be up and running as soon as possible with highest quality and security, it’s still there across the board.
What opportunities does the application economy present for IT companies today?
IT is the business, we see it more and more with companies like Google, Amazon, transition that Nike is doing from being a shoe maker to making wearable devices. Today software drives the business. Application economy is very good for us and we are gearing up all around that. 58% of those surveyed are looking at adopting application economy and are neither leaders not laggards. Its a huge opportunity for us.
The CIOs today everywhere struggle with the same set of issues related to demanding CEOs, demanding customers and so on. The value proposition that we bring to the CIOs today is the agility to rapidly respond to the changing dynamics of the internal and external stakeholders and clients. When we talk about release automation and service visualization aspects, it’s not only about saving of labor, it’s more about speed to market , quality of code, getting defects out of the system before release production. So the old objective to save costs, say by getting 40 people out of the department is what doesn’t matter now. What matters now is the revenue aspect and how to get to market quicker. That’s the value proposition we work with the CIOs.
How are you seeing enterprise management trends and adoption levels for some in India?
As we define enterprise management, it constitutes application performance monitoring, networking, server monitoring and so on. We do see it’s a very strong market for us in India. Modi government’s new focus on smart cities, the more business focused environment and the whole infrastructure build-up lend themselves very well with what we call enterprise management. In fact, it’s a large part of what we do in India.
How has been the demand and response from Indian CIOs for CA Technologies’ products?
We are seeing traction for DevOps in India amongst the BFSI companies. We are seeing more traction and demand for Release Automation products, with Service Visualization coming next. The largest transaction we did for API management solution during the quarter ended September 2014 was in India, and it was in BFSI vertical. Till about couple of years ago, this would not have been possible. But today with the kind of competition Indian companies are facing, the ability to get the products to market in a rapid manner and in a secure way is increasing, so we are seeing more and more CIOs looking at these solutions. We expect increased demand for enterprise management as India continues to build up its infrastructure and bandwidth capabilities and the pressure on CIOs in India increase (to deliver products rapidly).
So what role you see CA Technologies playing in government’s infrastructure build up?
We are in talks with the state government and are already doing projects for them. Government projects form a growing piece of our business. With state elections now over, we are seeing pick up again. As far as smart cities is concerned, we are looking at partnerships with Indian GSIs (global system integrators), local providers and other consultancy and IT firms — we are all working together to help build and monitor the functioning of infrastructure.
How do you intend to grow your offerings further in coming years?
We are at our core a software company and organic development is key to our growth. We spend nearly $ 600 million every year towards development, and our largest development center happens to be in India where we have invested $ 60 million at Hyderabad R&D centre. We also have facilities across Bangalore and Baroda. Having said that, we are also always in look out for inorganic opportunities related to new technologies that fit in with our core technology strengths.
Which verticals or segments are you focused on in India?
In India we focus on BFSI, government, telecom and a bit of retail. Having said that, we are into infrastructure management, enterprise management and application delivery – kind of common things that every industry is facing. So we have team focusing on specific sectors and companies, and at the same time working with our partners to make sure that we are not missing opportunity in other areas.
What are your medium term plans or targets for growth in emerging markets like India?
Currently we derive majority of our revenues from US market, which is more than the rest of the world combined. Our intent as an organisation is to grow our international business, but not at the expense of what we are doing in North America. We are seeing good traction for our solutions in the Asia Pacific and Japan region and going forward, we remain optimistic on — what we are doing, about products we are bringing to the market, the market opportunities we have and the people identifying those opportunities.

Pakistan not hopeful about resuming talks with India: Sartaj AzizBy: Press Trust of India | Islamabad |
Posted: December 2, 2014 5:09 pm | Updated: December 2, 2014 5:11 pm
Pakistan on Tuesday said that it is not hopeful about an early resumption of Indo-Pak talks alleging that India was trying to divert global attention from the core issue of Kashmir by branding it as terrorism.
Sartaj Aziz was talking to reporters after inaugurating the annual conference of the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) in Islamabad.
“India has suspended the dialogue process and now it is New Delhi’s responsibility to resume it,” he said.
India called off foreign secretary-level bilateral talks in August after Pakistani High Commissioner Abdul Basit’s meeting with Kashmiri separatist leader Shabir Shah.
Aziz also said that India instead of addressing the core issue of Kashmir was trying to divert international attention from it by branding struggle for self-determination with terrorism. He also called on the world community to play a role in the conflict.
“Over the last 40 years, bilateralism has failed on Kashmir and that’s why Pakistan wanted to engage international community on the matter,” he said.
He said normalisation and friendship with India could only be possible without compromising self-respect, honour and equality.
The remarks came days after leaders of the two countries shook hands at the SAARC summit in Nepal, creating hope for revival of talks.

BSE Sensex slips 115 pts in volatile trade after RBI holds ratesDirect equity set to top FDs as biggest asset class in FY15: Report
Markets fell for the second day with benchmark Sensex declining over 115 points today on selling in auto stocks after RBI kept interest rates unchanged for the fifth time in a row and IT shares dipped on strength in rupee.
In highly volatile trade, the 30-share BSE index fell to touch the day’s low of 28,386.46 following announcement of credit policy. However, the index recovered briefly to hit 28,576.39 on RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan’s hint of lowering rates early next year.
Participants later resorted to selling at every rise and the Sensex ended the day at 28,444.01, down 115.61 points, or 0.40 per cent. Yesterday, it had slipped 134.37 points.
On similar lines, the NSE 50-share Nifty, after swinging to and fro, settled with a loss of 31.20 points, or 0.36 per cent, at 8,524.70. Intra-day, it traded in a narrow range between 8,504.65 and 8,560.20.
“By not cutting rates, RBI has remained consistent in their policy objective of decisively bringing down inflation -and long term inflationary expectations. Lower post policy bond yields show the market feels more confident that eventually rates will be much lower,” said Arvind Sethi, MD & CEO, TATA Asset Management.
Rupee, which had breached 62-mark against dollar in previous sessions, today strengthened to 61.87 levels. This put pressure of shares IT companies, including TCS and Infosys, which earn most of their sales in the US currency.
Oil scrips also were on the sellers’ list after excise duty on petrol was hiked by Rs 2.25 per litre and by Re 1 a litre on diesel but retail pump rates won’t rise as oil firms have decided to absorb the duty change for the time being.
Over half of the 30 Sensex constituents ended with losses led by GAIL (down 2.85 per cent), M&M (2.47 per cent), HDFC (1.51 per cent) and Hero MotoCorp (1.48 per cent).
Sectorwise, BSE IT index suffered the most by losing 1.48 per cent, followed by Auto 1.05 per cent and Oil & Gas 0.66 per cent, among others.
Global cues, however, were conducive as Asian bourses ended higher and Europe was better in its opening trades.
Meanwhile, Foreign Portfolio Investors sold shares worth net Rs 12.36 crore yesterday, as per provisional data.

Finance Ministry Expects RBI to Support Revival of Growth
Reuters | Updated On: December 02, 2014 18:03 (IST)
China December Industrial Activity Shrinks for First Time in 7 Months
New Delhi: The Finance ministry said it looked forward to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) supporting the revival of growth and employment, after the apex bank resisted pressure on Tuesday to lower interest rates.
"The Government and RBI will work towards a monetary policy framework that will help institutionalize the gains achieved on the inflation front so as to reduce inflationary expectations and further support the revival of investment and growth," a Finance Ministry statement said.
Earlier, the RBI held interest rates steady, as widely expected, at a policy review and said it could ease monetary policy early next year provided inflationary pressures do not reappear and the government controls the fiscal deficit. ( Read more )

Vijay Mallya s exit brings fizz to UB Group stocksVijay Mallya's exit causes gains in UB Group stocks, troubles mount
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: December 2, 2014  | 19:59 IST
Vijay Mallya, United Breweries Group chairman (Photo: Reuters)
Vijay Mallya on Tuesday saw shares of his various group companies soar higher, in an irony of sorts, even as fresh troubles surfaced in form of the group's holding entity being slapped with yet another ' wilful defaulter ' tag.
This came a day after self-proclaimed 'King of Good Times' Mallya had to quit top posts at two group companies - Mangalore Chemicals & Fertilisers Ltd (MCFL) and grounded Kingfisher Airlines.
While most analysts have long stopped covering United Breweries stocks due to continuing troubles at various group companies and lack of liquidity, they were also taken by surprise to see a sudden spike of up to 20 per cent in share prices of group companies on Tuesday.
Some analysts said investors might be seeing the developments as a beginning of the end-game for Mallya, who no more has controlling stakes in United Spirits (USL) and United Breweries (UB) and his exit from MCFL and Kingfisher could leave UB Holdings (UBHL) as the only major entity where he may still have a significant role.
A few other analysts, however, said that the spike in UB group stocks could be like a 'dead cat bounce', which speculators might use to exit from their long-held positions.
The latest round of problems began last week with the minority shareholders of USL trouncing proposed financial dealings of the company with its erstwhile promoter Mallya, who remains its chairman as of now.
USL's controlling shareholder Diageo is mulling over ways to take forward the matter after an unprecedented activism on part of investors to reject a proposal involving business transactions between existing and erstwhile promoters.
In another major setback, the government rejected Mallya's re-appointment as managing director of Kingfisher Airlines, while he had to quit on his own from the board of MCFL on Monday.
Kingfisher, which had to be grounded in October 2012 due to severe financial crunch and mounting debt, had sought the Corporate Affairs Ministry's approval for Mallya's re-appointment for a period of five-year beginning October 16, 2013 "without remuneration", but the plea got rejected.
MCFL also announced Mallya's resignation on Monday as a director, without giving any reason.
The problems are expected to mount further as several banks, including public sector lender State Bank of India (SBI), are believed to have written to the boards of various UB group firms that no further loans would be provided to them in the wake of defaults made by Mallya and his group companies.
A senior banker said the loans availed by almost all UB Group companies indicated a complex web of transactions, where one entity was guarantor for the other and the second one took loans on the basis of guarantees given by yet another entity from the group or from among the promoters.
Notwithstanding the mounting troubles for the group, its holding company UBHL saw a 19.80 per cent surge in its share price to close at Rs 23.90 a piece on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).
McDowell Holdings stock also rose by 19.93 per cent to Rs 34.30, while United Breweries shares climbed 8.11 per cent to Rs 825.65. Shares of USL gained 7.14 per cent to Rs 2,913.
Shares of Pioneer Distilleries were also up 5 per cent.
Trading in shares of two companies - Kingfisher and UB Engineering - got suspended on Monday due to their non-compliance to Listing Agreement norms.
Kingfisher, which once prided itself as the most luxurious airline with Mallya being known as the 'King of Good Times', alone used to command a market value of over Rs 10,000 crore once, but now stands at just about Rs 100 crore.
The overall UB group market value has tanked by over half in the past one year, while excluding United Spirits.
The penal action by domestic bourses followed the companies' inability to prepare and publish financial results in time, which the firms have attributed to lack of staff.
Kingfisher has previously faced strong staff protests for non-payment of salaries, while it is also under regulatory scanner for various accounting lapses.
Mallya was serving as CMD of Kingfisher, which has been without a full-time CEO ever since Sanjay Agarwal left the company in early 2014.
As per the norms, a company, which is in the red or has inadequate profits, needs to approach the Corporate Affairs Ministry to get approval for appointment of key managerial personnel and directors and get no-objection certificates from shareholders and lenders.
The Ministry rejected the proposal in this case as it was already turned down by shareholders and lenders, sources said, while adding this particular decision was not directly linked to Mallya being declared a wilful defaulter.
The UB group has been seeing continuous troubles on various fronts for the last couple of years, beginning with a major cash crunch and high debt at Kingfisher Airlines. There are also pending service tax default cases against Kingfisher.
The group, which is also engaged in legal tussle with lenders, later sold a controlling stake in its prized unit USL to Diageo while some other assets were also divested in other businesses and two rival bidders came up from MCFL.
Default on loan payments has already seen a number of banks resorting to legal options to reclaim their funds, while some of them have also declared Mallya as a wilful defaulter.
The carrier is yet to submit its annual financial results for the 2013-14 financial year to the stock exchanges.

India is staring at a mammoth faculty vacancy in its elite higher education institutions, the latest official data has revealed.
India is staring at a mammoth faculty vacancy in its elite higher education institutions, the latest official data has revealed.
Faculty vacancy in the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) was 40 per cent as of July this year, most acute in Varanasi, Roorkee (above 50 per cent), Kharagur and Delhi. Vacancies were highest for OBC faculty.
In the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs), faculty vacancies stood at over 20 per cent, highest in Indore (52 per cent) and Ranchi (48 per cent).
“Yes, vacancies exist and aren’t desirable, and we are dealing with it,” Indranil Manna, Director of IIT Kanpur, told The Hindu. “It’s a long process and we don’t want any compromises with quality,” he said. In certain disciplines, the pool of qualified persons from whom to hire was simply not large enough, he added.
Forty per cent of the faculty positions in the 39 Central universities across the country are also vacant, the situation being more acute in the newer central universities. Over half of all faculty positions in Delhi University are vacant, and over 80 per cent of all professor, associate professor and assistant professor positions in the new Central university of Tamil Nadu are vacant.
The new numbers were submitted to the Rajya Sabha by Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani on Monday, in response to a question by Avinash Khanna, BJP MP from Punjab.
Contract, adjunct and visiting faculty as well as “using the online mode of teaching” were being pressed in to overcome these shortages, she said. The age of superannuation had been raised and faculty were being encouraged to undertake consultancy.

Congress leader Abdul Rahman Antulay became the first Minister of Minority Affairs in 2004
Congress leader Abdul Rahman Antulay, who died at 85 on Tuesday, would relate with deep bitterness his fall off the perch in 1982, embroiled in a corruption scandal that is still among the top on any list of Indian scandals – the ‘cement scam.’
His way of helping the poor through trusts to which industrialists were forced to donate money in lieu of cement allocation that he had discretion over was indeed a big mistake and misuse of political power.
Mr. Antulay was the Chief Minister of Maharashtra between 1980 and 1982. He believed it was a conspiracy that did him in, and there is an element of truth in it, as late journalist Dom Moraes writes in a 1992 book.
In 2004, the Congress resurrected him from oblivion and appointed him the Minister of Minority Affairs, a newly created portfolio.
Mr. Antulay displayed a sense of mass politics and aloofness simultaneously, was scholarly and populist at the same time, and never gave up the old world adherence to courtesies that he showed even to his worst critics. “He was an affable man, who had in his short tenure as CM made an excellent impression on most people,” wrote Mr. Moraes.
He was a confidant of Indira Gandhi and his rehabilitation in 2004 by Sonia Gandhi was seen as a reward for his loyalty. One of the trusts that landed in controversy was called Indira Gandhi Pratishthan.
As Minority Affairs Minister between 2004 and 2009, which was the evening stretch of his political career that started in 1962 as a member of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, Mr. Antulay oversaw the functioning of the Justice Rajinder Sachar committee that did a comprehensive study of the social, economical and educational conditions of Muslims.
But Mr. Antulay demonstrated understanding of, and sensitivity towards, the concerns of all minorities – religious and linguistic. He did not restrict the mandate of his ministry to Muslims.
His career concluded on a controversial note as he suggested that senior police officer Hemant Karkare’s death in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack may have something to do with his investigations into the terror groups of the Hindu right. The Congress disowned the comments and he lost the 2009 Lok Sabha elections.

Snapdeal targets $3-billion GMV salesSnapdeal targets $3-billion GMV sales
Nivedita Mookerji | New Delhi Dec 03, 2014 12:56 AM IST
Snapdeal, the online marketplace modelled on China’s Alibaba, is raising stakes in the e-commerce segment. A month after it raised $627 million (Rs 3,762 crore) from Japanese investor SoftBank, the company is targeting an annual $3 billion (Rs 18,000 crore) in gross merchandise value (GMV) sales by March 2015.
Company sources told Business Standard the Snapdeal management had set a goal to increase GMV to $3 billion from $1 billion (Rs 6,000 crore) in August this year. It is learnt the company touched $2 billion (Rs 12,000 crore) in GMV sales during November, as the festive season boosted sales.
Recently, Kunal Bahl, co-founder and chief executive of Snapdeal, had told this newspaper he wasn’t looking at growing the company in terms of millions of acres, as some of his competitors were. “We want to keep the company small,” he had said.
GMV, typical to the e-commerce sector, is a company’s annual run rate, based on the peak sales of its products for a particular month. It cannot be described as actual sales value; the e-commerce sector’s actual sales value is about $4 billion (Rs 24,000 crore), a fraction of the overall estimated retail pie of $600 billion (Rs 36 lakh crore).
Snapdeal’s rival Flipkart had last announced its GMV in March this year — $1 billion. Many rounds of funding later, sources estimate Flipkart’s GMV at about $3 billion, a figure Snapdeal is trying to catch up with.
But Flipkart is thinking ahead, too — it is set to roll out another round of big discounts, this time only to shoppers using mobile apps. The Flipkart sale is expected to go live from December 8. The company’s Big Billion Day sale in October had led to shopping frenzy, followed by disappointment with technical glitches.
While Flipkart was founded in 2007, Snapdeal came into existence in 2010, as a daily deal platform. Snapdeal was the first established online player in India to shift to the marketplace model, a format in which a company hosts traders on its website to sell products, in 2012. American online giant Amazon, which came to India in 2013, hasn’t made any announcement on GMV, though industry estimates suggest it had touched the $1-billion mark in a little more than a year.
Among other categories, Snapdeal sees much promise in automotive products, including cars, two-wheelers and accessories. While it had tie-ups with Mahindra & Mahindra and Hero for automobiles, the company was in talks with other car companies for selling their products online, an official said. The category, pegged at about Rs 15 crore GMV, was expected to be close to Rs 300 crore by the end of this financial year, he added. For this category, the GMV target for the near term is Rs 1,000 crore.
On categories, Bahl said more were on the way. “We paused during Diwali…My view is if a product/service can be bought offline, there is no reason why it can’t be sold online.” Online real estate shopping is another area Snapdeal plans to grow. Sources said the company might venture into building houses, too. Fashion and electronics remain Snapdeal’s large volume generators, much in the manner of other companies in this segment.
CORRECTION
Earlier version had said Snapdeal wants to get into online real estate shopping which it actually wants to grow.

Rent an Ugly Sweater for ChristmasNeed an ugly Christmas sweater? Now you can rent one
Krystina Gustafson CNBC
Email
Having good style is priceless. Sporting an ugly sweater to the company holiday party? That could run you into the triple digits and cost you space in your closet.
Rent the Runway, the online rental site that doles out designer duds for special occasions, on Tuesday  launched a capsule collection of ugly holiday sweaters , ahead of National Ugly Christmas Sweater Day on Dec. 12, that offers a solution.
Rent the Runway
Rent the Runway, the online rental site that doles out designer duds for special occasions, is now renting ugly sweaters ahead of National Ugly Christmas Sweater Day.
The site boasts 12 ugly sweaters, ranging from one with an actual teddy bear sewn onto the stomach, and another featuring a snowman and penguin frolicking at the North Pole. But you'd better act fast. Each sweater is unique and available only in the size listed.

A four-day rental costs $15, but after tacking on $5 for insurance, $10 for shipping and tax, the total cost tops $30. The site prompts shoppers to sign up for its "Pro" service, which offers free insurance, free shipping and a free birthday dress for $29.95 a year.
But men shouldn't feel left out. If you're willing to pony up some real change, online retailer Shinesty.com, which tells people wearing its clothing that they can "watch as members of the opposite sex instinctively flock like the Salmon of Capistrano" (a nod to "Dumb & Dumber"),  sells a number of "Ugly Christmas Sweater Suits."

IBM signs $1.25 bln WPP cloud deal, says more coming

IBM signs $1.25 bln WPP cloud deal, says more coming
Bart Van den Daele, IBM's general manager for strategic outsourcing in Europe, said big contract signings slowed in the depths of the euro crisis but that the region's customers are ready to play catch-up.
Post your opinion here
 
IBM is enjoying a wave of major technology outsourcing deals from European customers in the fourth quarter and the new contract signings are not over yet, an executive for the computer sciences giant said in an interview.
Late on Tuesday, IBM announced the third in a string of billion dollar plus contracts, saying it had won a seven-year, USD 1.25 billion deal with WPP, the world's top advertising firm, to run WPP operations in the cloud.
On Monday, IBM disclosed a multi-billion dollar deal to provide computer infrastructure services to Dutch bank ABN Amro. And last month, Lufthansa agreed a USD 1.25 billion contract for IBM to take over the German airline's information technology operations and staff.
Bart Van den Daele, IBM's general manager for strategic outsourcing in Europe, said big contract signings slowed in the depths of the euro crisis but that the region's customers are ready to play catch-up.
"(There's) a new wave of big deals which is still continuing and we see it going forward," Van den Daele said in a phone interview. "Now you see the first results with Lufthansa, ABN Amro and WPP and there will be others."
The common theme among European customers is their growing willingness to embrace the global corporate shift to Internet-based computing, or so-called cloud services, but while demanding several local twists, he said.
IBM seeks to differentiate its offering by focussing on hybrid clouds, which mix together the private, on-premise computer systems for which it has long been known with newer public-facing Internet, mobile and analytics systems, allowing clients to move existing systems to the cloud at their own pace.
This hybrid approach means companies can wait for years before they consider moving their most sensitive core financial systems to the cloud computers. It also gives them the option of never having to move.
Secondly, European clients demand that their data remain stored locally in European data centre, a requirement IBM has met by building seven public cloud data centres across Europe in London, Amsterdam, Paris and one in Germany, with another to follow there shortly.
WPP's deal will allow the London-based company to stitch together the operations of the more than 300 agencies it has acquired through a relentless roll-up of the advertising business over the past decade and more.
WPP signed its contract last quarter but it only went live recently, IBM's Van den Daele said. ABN was signed in the fourth quarter, while Lufthansa was also agreed this quarter but it won't start up until early 2015.

Bezos defends Amazon's wee profits, stance on publishers
His comments come a day after Moody's Investors Service downgraded its outlook on Amazon to "negative," citing the company's upcoming debt offering and the "lack of visibility" about how the funds would be deployed.

Bezos defends Amazon's wee profits, stance on publishers
His comments come a day after Moody's Investors Service downgraded its outlook on Amazon to "negative," citing the company's upcoming debt offering and the "lack of visibility" about how the funds would be deployed.
Post your opinion here
 
Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon.com Inc, was unapologetic about his twenty-year-old company's lack of profit during a rare public appearance on Tuesday, noting he spends just six hours a year on investor relations.
Bezos also discussed Amazon's acrimonious dispute with publisher Hachette Book Group and his purchase of the Washington Post. He acknowledged that Amazon had a succession plan in place, but remained tight-lipped about the details.
His comments come a day after Moody's Investors Service downgraded its outlook on Amazon to "negative," citing the company's upcoming debt offering and the "lack of visibility" about how the funds would be deployed.
Investors have grown increasingly unhappy about Amazon's spending and lack of disclosure about future plans. Its shares have fallen more than 18 percent this year, despite a 14 percent rise in the Nasdaq.
Bezos, relaxed in jeans and a gray jacket, defended Amazon's culture as one willing to spend on new projects, even if they flop like its poor-selling Fire phone.
"We are a large company, but we are also still a start-up. There is a lot of volatility in start-ups," Bezos said at a conference organized by the Business Insider blog in New York.
Bezos, an investor in Business Insider, defended Amazon's approach during its drawn-out contract dispute with Hachette, which came to light after Amazon delayed deliveries and removed pre-order options for several Hachette titles. The dispute was settled in November.
Publishers are in better shape because of e-books, which became popular after Amazon launched the Kindle e-reader in 2007, he said, adding that books are still too expensive.
"It's difficult for incumbents who have a sweet thing to embrace change," Bezos said. "Making reading more affordable is not going to make authors less money. ... It's going to make authors more money."
Bezos entered another embattled industry last year when he bought the Washington Post from the Graham family. He was initially surprised when approached about the sale, but said Don Graham convinced him. He plans to turn the Post into a national and international newspaper.
Bezos, 50, also acknowledged that there is a succession plan in place for him and his executives. When asked to reveal the next generation of leadership, he said: "It's a secret."

Tiger Woods is now Hero MotoCorp s global brand ambassadorConcerted effort to manipulate machinery: Court in coal case
India’s two-wheeler giant, the Hero MotoCorp, has signed American golf legend Tiger Woods as its brand ambassador in a four-year deal that targets capturing new markets in North America and Europe.
The deal, for an undisclosed amount, can be termed as the biggest for an Indian manufacturer in terms of association with a global icon is concerned.
Interestingly, the announcement has come two days before the start of the prestigious PGA event World Challenge, which is hosted by Tiger Woods Foundation and Hero MotoCorp Ltd as the title sponsors.
“We have gone beyond the Hero World Challenge and we will also have Tiger Woods as our corporate partner for the next four years starting from December 1,” Pawan Munjal, Managing Director, Hero Motocorp India, told a select media gathering here.
“It is an endorsement deal with Tiger Woods in which he will not only be partnering but also promoting Hero as a brand across the globe,” Munjal said adding that “It is not just for the US market.”
Hero Group is world’s largest two-wheeler manufacturer but still considered only a domestic player. Joining hands with Woods is clearly a move to create a space at global level. The 38-year-old golf legend is a 14-time major championship winner, second only to Jack Nicklaus (18).
Asked what made them choose a player, whose reputation took a beating five years back due to his infidelity scandal, Munjal said they have taken a very “conscious” decision.
“Let me tell you, we are absolutely thrilled to be in a partnership with Tiger. Hero and Tiger together represent the best in our respective professions. Whatever happened is now all behind him. He went public, apologised for what has happened and he is back in the game,” Munjal said.
“People are back with him, many corporates are back with him and obviously Hero took a very conscious call,” he added, explaining the move.

Shakira wants to keep her son away from spotlightBy: Press Trust of India | London |
Posted: December 3, 2014 10:38 am
Pregnant popstar Shakira wants to bring up her son away from the glare of spotlight. The 37-year-old singer called on the paparazzi not to click pictures of her toddler son and let him enjoy a “normal” childhood, reported Contactmusic.
“I liked being able to share with fans and the people who have always supported us… But now that Milan is growing and has stopped being a baby, I would prefer it if the press did not focus so much on him. I would like him to enjoy a normal childhood, as much as that is possible” she said.
Shakira reveals that the toddler has no idea that his parents are celebrities and likes to keep it that way as long as possible. “Milan still does not realise that Gerard and I are famous, because that is all he knows. He recognises us on television and in ads, he points and says ‘Mama!’ and ‘Papa!’, but does not know that other kids do not find the image of their parents on a toy box” she added.
Shakira and Spanish soccer star Gerrard Pique have been dating since 2010 and they are expecting a baby in early 2015.

Manipur government extends disturbed area status for one more yearBy: Press Trust of India | Imphal |
Posted: December 3, 2014 11:05 am
The ‘disturbed area status’ for Manipur under the controversial Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) has been extended for another year from December 1.
The decision was taken at a Cabinet meeting on December 1 last after considering the overall situation of the state, state education minister and government spokesman M Okendro said.
Section 3 of the AFSPA empowers the state government to extend the disturbed area over the entire state or some selected areas, Okendro said.
Except the eight assembly segments in the Imphal Municipal Council in the city, the disturbed area status would be applicable to the valley and hill districts in the rest of the state.
“Taking serious note of frequent bomb blasts and other acts of violence, the government considered it necessary to extend the disturbed area status in the state,” the spokesman said
The AFSPA, which was imposed in the state since September 1980, has been extended from time to time, the sources said.

Modi govt must ask itself if it can afford to keep Sadhvi Jyoti in ministryBy: Express News Service | New Delhi |
Posted: December 3, 2014 10:54 am | Updated: December 3, 2014 3:48 pm
Union minister of state Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti described the choice for voters in Delhi as one between “Ramzaadon” (those born of Ram) and “haramzaadon” (the illegitimately born). The comment — made in the national capital, barely a few weeks after the communal violence in east Delhi’s Trilokpuri had simmered down — deservedly provoked wide outrage, including in Parliament, and the minister has since apologised. But the Narendra Modi government needs to ask itself if this is — if it can be allowed to be — the end of the matter.

For six months now, whatever else it may or may not have done, the Modi government has proved to be remarkably adept and inventive in keeping alive the expectation of “change” and “hope” that swept it to power. The PM talks of “Make in India” and “Swachh Bharat”, energetically occupies the “can do” space, disarming political opponents and rivals in the process.

At the same time, from the very beginning, another chorus has been rising from within the parivar, which articulates hate and prejudice against minorities and which would appear to be distracting from, and even in direct conflict with, the unexceptionable and apparently inclusive message that the prime minister is straining to project as his own. If there was the vicious “love jihad” campaign earlier that could not deliver the expected results in the UP by-polls, there has been the unabashed rhetoric of polarisation used by partymen in poll-bound Delhi and new hunting ground West Bengal, more recently.
So far, Modi has maintained a stoic silence on the other voice and the other message. But as the hate speech becomes louder and bolder, and as it travels from the parivar’s so-called fringe and climbs up to the Union ministry, the PM’s uncharacteristic wordlessness is becoming more conspicuous. It is also giving rise to a question: how does a PM so communicative, and one who is known to tightly centralise and control the message, allow a Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti to so blatantly disrespect the Constitution she has sworn allegiance to and get away with it? In this case, can a mere apology be enough?
It is not enough for the PM to send out a coded reprimand — at a meeting of BJP lawmakers in Parliament on Tuesday, he warned them against speaking out of turn. This is the moment for a forthright response. Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti must be asked to resign from the ministry. At best, her continuation as minister is a distraction from Modi’s stated agenda for change. At worst, it suggests that this government’s professions to be religion-neutral provide a cover for the free rein it seems to give to a lengthening line of bigots and chauvinists.

Rest in peace my little brother! Australia bid emotional farewell to Phillip HughesBy: Reuters | Macksville |
Posted: December 3, 2014 10:51 am | Updated: December 3, 2014 2:19 pm
Australia bid an emotional farewell to cricketer Phillip Hughes at a funeral in his hometown on Wednesday with a live coast-to-coast broadcast allowing a nation to unite in celebration of the life of a sportsman cut down in his prime. (Also Read: I keep looking for him, says emotional Clarke)
Eight days after Hughes was struck by a ball on the back of the head and six after he died from the catastrophic injuries that resulted, his family, friends and a host of cricketing greats gathered at Macksville High School.
Cricket Australia Chief Executive James Sutherland spoke for many when he tried to make sense of the huge outpouring of grief that followed the tragic death of the lefthanded batsman a few days short of his 26th birthday.
“The wave of emotion that has washed over our country this past week tells us so much about the affection millions felt for Phillip and also about the privileged place cricket has near the heart of this nation,” he said.
(View: Cricket must return to refresh and invigorate us)
“Quite simply, the boy from this proud community of Macksville, personified the spirit of Australian cricket.
“Ever since Bradman, the image of the innocent country boy playing in the backyard while dreaming of wearing a baggy green cap has become entrenched in our psyche. It’s our foundation myth as a cricketing nation.”
Some 1,000 mourners, mostly locals with a smattering of luminaries including Prime Minister Tony Abbott, dabbed away tears and perspiration in the baking heat of the school hall with thousands more watching on screens in the sunshine outside. (Also Read: Best quotes from tributes to Hughes)
From the eulogies, they learned of a beloved son, brother, cousin and friend whose passion for cricket was matched only by his enthusiasm for the Angus cattle he helped raise on the family farm.
They were also reminded of a small town boy with a prodigious talent for hitting a ball with a bat who headed down the coast to big city Sydney as a teenager and ended up playing 26 Tests for his country.
Australia captain Michael Clarke broke down in tears for the second time in a few days as he paid public tribute to his former team mate and friend.
“Phillip’s spirit, which is now part of our game forever, will act as a custodian of the sport we all love. We must listen to it,” he said, struggling to contain his emotions.
“We must cherish it. We must learn from it. We must dig in and get through to tea. And we must play on.
“So rest in peace my little brother. I will see you out in the middle.”
CRICKET GREATS
Australian greats of the game such as Shane Warne, Ricky Ponting and Glenn McGrath were in attendance, while Richard Hadlee, Brian Lara and India captain Virat Kohli represented the wider cricket world.
New South Wales paceman Sean Abbott, who delivered the bouncer that dealt the fatal blow in a state match at the Sydney Cricket Ground last Tuesday, was also among the mourners.
When he suffered the injury, Hughes was batting for a recall to the Australia side for the opening match in the Test series against India, which has since been rescheduled.
Tributes continued to flood in from around the world on Wednesday, many joining the viral campaign to get people to place cricket bats outside homes, workplaces and at sports grounds in tribute to Hughes.
Hughes’s own bat rested against the coffin throughout a service which concluded with “Don’t Let The Sun Go Down On Me”, the song Elton John dedicated to the cricketer when he played it in a concert in Munich last week.
Clarke and fellow cricketers Aaron Finch and Tom Cooper joined Hughes’s father and brother among the pallbearers and delivered the coffin to the hearse, which then set off in a procession through the town.
Hughes was cremated in a private ceremony.

Nov services PMI grows at fastest pace in 5...Bank of India
(The HSBC Services PMI, rose…)
NEW DELHI: Faster growth in fresh orders spurred India's services sector, the largest contributor to the economy, to a fivemonth high in November while business sentiment slipped to the weakest level in nearly seven years, according to a private survey released on Wednesday.
The HSBC's purchasing managers' index for services accelerated to 52.6 points in November, compared to stagnation in the previous month. A reading above 50 on this survey-based index indicates expansion while below that underlines contraction.
"Service sector activity grew in November, as new business rose for the seventh month running," said Pranjul Bhandari, HSBC's chief Indian economist.
Business sentiment, however, slipped to the weakest level since mid-2007, according to the report based on a survey of 350 private firms.
"Despite the uptick in order flows, business sentiment deteriorated, reminding us that continued policy action that addresses investor concerns is needed to sustain growth momentum," said Bhandari.
The official GDP data released last week for the quarter to September showed slight improvement in the services sector, which grew 6.8% compared to 6.1% in the year-ago period.
Overall GDP growth during the quarter was 5.3%, slower than 5.7% in the previous threemonth period.
As per the survey, the headline HSBC Composite Output Index, which takes both services and manufacturing into account, rose to a five-month high of 53.6 points from 51 in the previous month.Post and telecommunications was the best performing among the broad areas monitored while contractions in activity were registered in financial intermediation, and hotels and restaurants, the report said.
According to the government's data, trade, hotels, transport and communication together recorded 3.8% growth in the July-September quarter, faster than 2.8% in the preceding quarter.
Banking sector is struggling with low credit offtake due to low investment sentiment.
HSBC's index for manufacturing rose to a 21-month high of 53.3 points in November, backed by strong output growth and robust orders.
The effect of manufacturing shows up in the services sector with a lag."Meanwhile, prices dipped on falling commodity prices and increased competition," said Bhandari.
Prices charged by Indian services firms deteriorated for the first time in more than four years in November.The Reserve Bank of India kept interest rates unchanged in its policy meet on Tuesday, but hinted at a cut early next year if inflation continues to ease and the government acts on the fiscal side.

Maruti top pick in auto sector  says BofA; ups target price to 3 750; stock in greenMaruti Suzuki
(The global investment bank…)
NEW DELHI: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd (MSIL) is the top pick in the India Auto sector and following sharp depreciation in Yen will lead to around 2 per cent rise in FY16E EPS, says BofA-ML.
The global investment bank who has a 'buy' rating on the counter raised its target price to Rs 3750, which translates into an upside of over 11 per cent from Tuesday's closing price of Rs 3,356.85.
At 11:39 am, the stock was at Rs 3,388.00; up 0.81 per cent, on the BSE.
For the year the stock has already rallied a little over 90 per cent.
BofA-ML raised their MSIL profit forecasts by 5 per cent each over FY16-17E, solely driven by revised EBITDA margin assumptions, even as their volume forecasts remain unaltered.
Following sharp depreciation in Yen, they have raised their EBITDA margin assumptions by 60bps/year to 13.6%-13.8%. They expect the company to partially pass on this benefit to customers in the form of higher incentives/ discounts.
Despite a muted recovery this fiscal year, MSIL has registered 13 per cent YTD growth thanks to strong petrol car demand and recent product successes, i.e. Celerio hatchback, Ciaz sedan.
BofA-ML expects gains to sustain and thereby retain their volume growth forecasts of 19 per cent in FY16E and 15 per cent in FY17E, driven by (1) better economic conditions and a favourable interest regime.

Rupee trading a tad weak at 61.91Rupee up 3 paise at 61.86
Our Bureau/PTI
Tweet
Mumbai, Dec 3:  
The rupee wiped off its early losses and was trading marginally strong at 61.86 against the dollar at 4.17 pm local time on mild dollar selling by exporters and banks.
After opening flat at 61.88 against the previous close of 61.89, the domestic unit hovered in the range of 61.84 and 61.95 in the afternoon trade.
The RBI kept the benchmark rates unchanged in the policy announcement yesterday but said it could cut the benchmark rates early next year provided inflationary pressures do not reappear and the Centre controls the fiscal deficit.
Forex dealers said apart from the gains in the dollar against other currencies in the global markets on impressive US data, fresh demand for the American unit from importers weighed on the rupee in early trade.
The rupee had gained 15 paise to close at 61.89 against the dollar in yesterday’s trade due to selling of the US currency by exporters and banks even as domestic markets ended lower.

NCP chief Sharad Pawar injured in fall at home  rushed to hospitalPeshawar school attack: Pakistani pupils recall narrow escapes, carnage in Taliban slaughter
NCP chief Sharad Pawar was today admitted to a hospital here after he sustained leg injury from a fall at his Delhi residence.
“Pawar sustained leg fracture at his Delhi residence. He insisted on being treated in Mumbai and was accordingly flown here today,” NCP sources told PTI.
The air ambulance carrying Pawar landed in Mumbai at 11.15 AM and he was taken straight to the Breach Candy Hospital where doctors will decide the next course of treatment after a thorough examination, the sources said.
NCP leaders Praful Patel and Chhagan Bhujbal were among those present at the hospital when the ambulance carrying Pawar reached around noon.
A three-time Chief Minister of Maharashtra and a former Union Minister, the 73-year-old leader was accompanied by wife Pratibha and daughter Supriya Sule in the air ambulance.
Pawar, who left Congress and formed the Nationalist Congress Party in 1999, is currently a member of Rajya Sabha.

Lady Gaga reveals she was raped as a teenagerIndia ranks 65th on tourism competitiveness index
American pop sensation Lady Gaga has revealed that she was raped as a teenager and she went through emotional therapy to recover from the incident.
During a candid interview with Howard Stern, Lady Gaga, 28, recalled how she was sexually assaulted when she was around 19-years-old, but she only spoke of the incident now because she does not want “to be defined by it”, reported Us magazine.
“I went through some horrific things that I’m able to laugh (at) now, because I’ve gone through a lot of mental and physical therapy and emotional therapy to heal over the years.
“My music’s been wonderful for me. But, you know, I was a shell of my former self at one point. I was not myself. To be fair, I was about 19. I went to Catholic school and then all this crazy stuff happened, and I was going, ‘Oh, is this just the way adults are?'” she said.
Gaga said that she did not divulge information about the assault before because she did not want the attacker to receive any credit for her motivation to succeed.

Australia bids tearful adieu to Phillip HughesAustralia bids tearful adieu to Phillip Hughes
Press Trust of India | Macksville Dec 03, 2014 11:15 AM IST
Eyes welled up all around and mourners, including Australian skipper Michael Clarke, broke down while reading out heart-rending tributes to the late Phillip Hughes, who was laid to rest in his home town here today.
In a funeral attended by thousands and televised live, friends, family and teammates paid their tributes to the young batsman, who died after being hit on the head by a bouncer during a domestic game last week.
The Indian team, which is here for a Test and limited-overs series, was represented by captain Virat Kohli, batsman Rohit Sharma and Team Director Ravi Shastri during an emotional goodbye to the player, who would have turned 26 the previous Sunday.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also joined the world in bidding farewell to Hughes, sending out a tweet to pay his last respects.
"Heart-rending funeral in Australia. Phil Hughes, we will miss you. Your game & exuberance won you fans all over! RIP," Modi tweeted.
Elton John's "Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me" filled the air as Hughes' coffin was led out after the tribute ceremony for a procession around the streets of Macksville to allow people to pay their last respects. The singer had paid tribute to Hughes at his concert in Munich last Thursday.
The procession moved through the streets with players and other mourners walking behind. The Australian players later formed a guard of honour and the hearse and the funeral procession moved past them en route to the burial.
The coffin was carried from the prayer hall of the Macksville High School by pallbearers -- Phillip's father Greg and brother Jason, along with Michael Clarke, Mitchell Lonergan, Matthew Day, Aaron Finch and Tom Cooper, who was the departed player's housemate in Adelaide and was batting with him when he was struck by the fatal delivery.
The prayer service at the school was led by Father Michael Alcock and mourners were left wiping tears as touching tributes were read out by Hughes' siblings, friends and Clarke.
"I don't know about you, but I keep looking for him. I know it is crazy but I expect any minute to take a call from him or to see his face pop around the corner. Is this what we call the spirit? If so, then his spirit is still with me. And I hope it never leaves," a choked Clarke said.

Petrol and diesel prices may fall after crude hits lowPetrol and diesel prices may fall after crude hits low
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, November 28, 2014
First Published: 00:59 IST(28/11/2014) | Last Updated: 14:48 IST(28/11/2014)

Petrol and diesel are likely to turn cheaper in India as global oil prices slumped to four-year lows of around $70 a barrel on Thursday after OPEC — a  group of major oil supplying countries — decided against cutting back production.
OPEC Secretary-General Abdullah al-Badri waits for the start of a meeting of OPEC oil ministers at OPEC's headquarters in Vienna. (Reuters)
India imports nearly two-thirds of its crude oil requirement. The sharp fall in global crude prices will cut companies’ import bills,  enabling them to reduce retail prices of petrol and diesel.
Domestic oil industry sources said petrol prices could fall below Rs. 60 a litre in the coming weeks, if the slide in global crude prices continues to follow the current pattern.
Lower fuel costs will aid the government’s efforts to keep inflation low and stable.
India’s retail inflation fell to a three-year low of 5.52% in October while the wholesale inflation rate plunged to a five-year low of 1.77%, aided by a sharp drop in vegetable and petrol prices.
Lower inflation, in turn, could prompt the Reserve Bank to cut interest rates and nudge banks to lower home loan EMIs.
“If the slide in oil prices continues, we can expect petrol prices to drop below Rs. 60 a litre from around Rs. 65 presently (in Delhi),” said the chairman of a leading oil company seeking anonymity.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, a cartel of 12 oil producing nations that controls 40% of the world’s oil output, in a five-hour meeting in Vienna decided not to reduce production, despite a 30% fall in oil prices since June.
Since August, petrol has turned cheaper by Rs. 9.36 a litre in six price cuts, while diesel prices have been cut by Rs. 5.62 a litre since October.
Petrol now cost Rs. 64.25 a litre in Delhi and Rs. 71.91 in Mumbai. Diesel, India’s most consumed fuel, costs Rs. 53.35 a litre in Delhi and Rs. 61.04 in Mumbai. Prices vary between states due to local levies.
Softer crude prices will also bolster the government’s plans to tame inflation and curtail fuel subsidies. A lower subsidy bill will help contain fiscal deficit — a measure of the amount the government borrows to fund its expenses — at the budgeted level of 4.1% of GDP in 2014-15.
Being the world’s fourth-largest oil consumer, India imports around 190 million tonnes of crude oil a year at $145 billion, or more than a third of its total import bill. With every dollar decrease in oil prices, the government’s oil import bill comes down by Rs. 4,000 crore.

Delhi: Rs. 1.5cr stolen  guard killed in ATM heistIn a daring daylight heist, two men on a motorcycle gunned down a security guard and robbed Rs. 1.5 crore from an ATM kiosk in north Delhi's busy Kamla Nagar on Saturday.
 
The incident took place at around 11am when custodians of a van belonging to a private cash replenishment firm were refilling money into the Citibank ATM, said joint commissioner of police Sandeep Goel.
 
“Two men on a bike arrived and shot the security guard twice in his head. They then picked up a bag containing Rs. 1.5 crore from inside the kiosk and fled brandishing their weapons,” said a senior police officer.
 
Kamla Nagar is an area adjacent to the University of Delhi’s main campus and is largely occupied by students.

Earlier this week, unidentified men hauled off a Union Bank of India cash machine from west Delhi’s Narela and also snatched the CCTV cameras installed in the booth.
 
The injured security guard, Satinder Singh, was taken to a nearby hospital where he died at around 3.30pm, sources said.
 
“He was not breathing and his blood pressure was low. He was revived artificially and his blood pressure brought up. But after the CT scan and other investigations, he collapsed again and finally could not be revived,” said Dr Siddharth Ramji, medical superintendent of Lok Nayak hospital.
 
Police have lodged a case including charges of attempt to murder, armed robbery and sections of the Arms Act while CCTV footage from the area is being scanned to identify the criminals.
 
"We extend our deepest condolences to the family of the security guard employed by our service provider, who lost his life in this tragic incident. We will cooperate fully with the law enforcement authorities in their efforts to bring the perpetrators of this crime to justice," a Citibank spokesperson told HT.
 
Several teams led by DCP Madhur Verma are investigating the case under the overall supervision of special CP Deepak Mishra, sources said.
 
In 2012, five armed robbers made off with a private bank’s cash van carrying Rs. 5.25 crore in south Delhi’s Defence Colony at around 1.45pm on September 28, after intercepting the vehicle and shooting at the guard.

“I am yet to meet him or contact him. I will first offer Friday prayers and then plan how to meet my son,” Dr Majeed said.
Sources say Areeb landed at Mumbai international airport at 5:15am and was immediately taken into custody by NIA officials.
Areeb and three other young men – Fahad Shaikh, Saheem Tanki and Amaan Tandel —from Kalyan in Maharashtra’s Thane district went to Iraq in May to join the jihadi group, investigators said. How Areeb managed to escape and go to Turkey is still unknown.
According to police, the four engineering students – radicalised over the internet – flew to Baghdad as part of a group of 22 pilgrims visiting religious shrines in Iraq. But intelligence agencies later intercepted phone calls where the men were crying and asking their families to seek the government’s help for their return.
On August 26, Saheem called up Dr Majeed and told him that his son had become a “martyr”, and Pakistan-based terrorist group Anwar-ul-Tawhid declared Areeb’s martyrdom on its now-defunct website.
Maharashtra’s anti-terrorism squad (ATS), which earlier questioned the youngsters’ relatives, is also in touch with the NIA over Areeb’s return, sources said.
Intelligence and security officials have warned that the Islamic State is trying to indoctrinate and recruit young volunteers online from India – home to the world’s second-largest Muslim population.
However, national security adviser Ajit Doval said at this month's HT Leadership Summit that no more than 10 Indian Muslims had gone to join IS militants in Iraq and Syria.

The price of non-subsidised cooking gas (LPG) was on Monday cut by a sharp Rs 113 per cylinder and that of jet fuel (ATF) by 4.1 per cent on the back of slump in international oil rates.
This is the fifth straight reduction in rates of non-subsidised LPG, which the customers buy after exhausting their quota of 12 cylinders at subsidised rates, since August.
A 14.2-kg cylinder of non-subsidised LPG will now cost Rs 752 in Delhi, Rs 791 in Kolkata, Rs 770.50 and Mumbai and Rs 749.50 in Chennai.
The price in Delhi was cut from Rs 922.50 in July 2014, to Rs 920 in August and then again to Rs 901 in September. In two separate cuts in October the price was reduced first to Rs 880 and then to Rs 883. The last cut before Monday’s was in November when the price was dropped to Rs 865.
Likewise, the price of aviation turbine fuel (ATF), or jet fuel, at Delhi was cut by Rs 2,594.93 per kilolitre, or 4.1 per cent, to Rs 59,943 per kl. This is the fifth straight monthly reduction in rates. This reduction follows a steep 7.3 per cent or Rs 4,987.7 per kl, cut in prices on November 1.
In Mumbai, jet fuel will cost Rs 61,695 per kl from Monday. The rates vary because of differences in local sales tax or VAT.
Global crude prices are close to levels last seen in 2009, when the global economy was gripped by its worst slump since the 1930s. Continuing its downward trend, Brent Crude fell 1.7 per cent on Monday morning to USD 68.40 a barrel or 40 per cent below its peak in June.

Amazon Releasing 15 000 Robots In Its WarehousesAmazon Releasing 15,000 Robots In Its Warehouses
 |  By                                                                      By BRANDON BAILEY

TRACY, California (AP) — A year ago, Amazon.com workers like 34-year-old Rejinaldo Rosales hiked miles of aisles each shift to "pick" each item a customer ordered and prepare it for shipping.
Now the e-commerce giant boasts that it has boosted efficiency — and given workers' legs a break — by deploying more than 15,000 wheeled robots to crisscross the floors of its biggest warehouses and deliver stacks of toys, books and other products to employees.
"We pick two to three times faster than we used to," Rosales said during a short break from sorting merchandise into bins at Amazon's massive distribution center in Tracy, California, about 60 miles east of San Francisco. "It's made the job a lot easier."
Amazon.com Inc., which faces its single biggest day of online shopping on Monday, has invested heavily this year in upgrading and expanding its distribution network, adding new technology, opening more shipping centers and hiring 80,000 seasonal workers to meet the coming onslaught of holiday orders. Amazon says it processed orders for 36.8 million items on the Monday after Thanksgiving last year, and it's expecting "Cyber Monday" to be even busier this year.
CEO Jeff Bezos vows to one day deliver packages by drone, but that technology isn't ready yet. Even so, Amazon doesn't want a repeat of last year, when some customers were disappointed by late deliveries attributed to Midwestern ice storms and last-minute shipping snarls at both UPS and FedEx. Meanwhile, the company is facing tough competition from rivals like Google and eBay, and traditional retailers are offering more online services.
Amazon has forecast revenue of $27.3 billion to $30.3 billion for the holiday quarter, up 18 percent from last year but less than Wall Street had expected. However, Amazon has invested billions of dollars in its shipping network and its reliability is a big selling point to customers, Piper Jaffray investment analyst Gene Munster wrote in a note to clients Friday. He thinks Amazon's forecast is conservative.
The Seattle-based company now has 109 shipping centers around the globe. The Tracy facility is one of 10 in which Amazon has deployed the robots, using technology acquired when the company bought robot-maker Kiva Systems Inc. in 2012, said Dave Clark, Amazon's senior vice president for operations, who gave reporters a tour on Sunday.
More than 1,500 full-time employees work at the Tracy center, which has 1.2 million square feet of space — the equivalent of 28 football fields. They are joined by about 3,000 robots, gliding swiftly and quietly around the warehouse. The robots navigate by scanning coded stickers on the floor, following digital commands that are beamed wirelessly from a central computer.
Each of the squat orange machines can slide under and then lift a stack of shelves that's four feet wide and holds up to 750 pounds of merchandise.  The system uses bar codes to track which items are on each shelf, so a robot can fetch the right shelves for each worker as orders come in.
Because the robots travel underneath, the shelves can be stacked closely together, which means the warehouse can hold more goods, Clark said. The Tracy center now holds about 20 million items, representing 3.5 million different products, from bottles of gourmet steak sauce to high-end audio headsets, books and video games. Clark said it can ship 700,000 items in a day, but will hold more and ship more by next year.
The robots will cut the Tracy center's operating costs by 20 percent, Clark said. But he was quick to assert they won't eliminate jobs.
"We're continuing to grow. Growth has always driven hiring," Clark said. The company has, in fact, increased its workforce by more than a third over the last year to 149,500 full-time employees. Clark said workers are needed for more complex tasks such as shelving, packing and checking for damaged items.
However, a 10,000-strong fleet of robots could help Amazon save $450 million to $900 million a year in labor expenses, Shawn Milne of Janney Capital Markets estimated in a report last summer. By allowing Amazon to store and ship more goods from each shipping center, the robots will likely reduce the number of new centers that Amazon will have to build and staff as it grows, Michael Pachter of Wedbush Securities said on Monday. He compared it to automakers' use of robots on their assembly lines, which has reduced the number of worker hours required to build a car.
The new robotic system takes the complexity of different tasks into account, rather than forcing employees to work at an inhuman pace, Clark added.
Rosales agrees. Though he works rapidly, he said the robots "actually adjust to your speed. If you're picking slower, they slow down."

Defence ministry looking to increase Make India opportunitiesGovt considering 6 FDI proposals in single-brand retail
The ministry of defence (MoD) is looking to increase ‘Make India’ opportunities. It is expected to approve a tweak in policy at the next acquisition council meeting to make the option more attractive to the domestic industry. A source in MoD told FE: “The next meeting of the defence acquisition council next week, headed by defence minister Manohar Parrikar, will finalise and approve the ‘Make India’ category of the defence procurement procedure.”
“There will not be any dilution of the current category, rather it will be made easier to understand and more attractive for Indian vendors who are investing in high risk areas,” sources said.
In 2006, MoD had decided to follow the path to technological self-reliance by introducing the ‘Make’ procedure for indigenous design, development and production of high technology complex systems. In its wake, a few projects were identified to be undertaken as ‘Make’ projects. These included the Future Infantry Combat Vehicle, Tactical Communication System and Battlefield Management System projects. However, eight years later, there is little to show by way of results.
Realizing it was getting nowhere with the ‘Make’ projects, MoD announced in April 2013 that a high-level panel had been formed for simplification of the ‘Make’ procedure to ‘unleash the full potential of this important category”.
Last year, the MoD circulated a revised draft of the ‘Make’ procedure to industry associations, seeking feedback. “The ‘Make India’ and the new government’s ‘Make in India’ initiative are different. The current Make-in-India push of the government is an echo of MoD’s long-cherished aspiration for self-reliance in defence production. This was articulated in the Defence Production Policy of January 2011,” explained an official.
The defence projects under ‘Make’ category have to go through three phases. The first phase begins with identification of projects that can be categorised as ‘Make’ projects, followed by formulation of provisional services qualitative requirements, feasibility study of the project and finally acceptance of necessity.
Protection of intellectual property rights is one the most significant changes proposed. It is likely to be specified that IPR shall vest in the development agencies that develop the technology. However, MoD would retain ab-initio, irrevocable, transferable and fully-paid license in respect of the technology for its own use.
The revised ‘Make’ procedure could possibly go into great details in laying down principles to be followed for protection of IPR, the extent of government rights, including march-in rights, as also other aspects. This should address a major concern of the development agencies, including foreign collaborators.
The existing procedure provides for funding of ‘Make’ projects to the extent of 80% by MoD. This would remain unchanged but more elaborate guidelines are likely to be prescribed for funding of the projects through milestone-related payments based on principles of allowability, allocability and reasonableness of expenses claimed by development agencies as per the terms of the contract.  Indian-industry initiated and developed projects is another clause that could be added to the amended category of ‘Make’.

Sweet November for most carmakers as sales look upConcerted effort to manipulate machinery: Court in coal case
Car sales in November showed signs of revival on the back of new launches. The top three carmakers — Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai and Honda — fared well, as did others. Utility vehicle maker Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), after a spurt in volumes last  month, saw a decline due to sluggish demand for its utility vehicles.
Barring M&M and American carmaker Ford, all other carmakers showed signs of recovery, including the beleaguered Tata Motors and Toyota Kirloskar.
India’s largest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki, reported a 17% jump in domestic sales to 100,024 vehicles, spurred mainly by the recently launched mid-size sedan Ciaz. However, the impressive sales numbers were somewhat dampened by the company’s nnouncement of a ‘service campaign’ for 3,796 cars to replace part of the clutch operation system.
Hyundai Motor India, the second largest, saw volumes grow for the third straight month to 35,511 vehicles, a rise of 6% compared with the year-ago period. The carmaker piggybacked on the new launches led by the i20 Elite, which since its launch on September 22 this year has clocked over 10,000 units.
Tata Motors delivered its fourth straight jump in volumes on the back of the newly launched entry-level sedan, the Zest. The carmaker sold 12021 passenger vehicles in November, a rise of 15.8% compared with the year-
ago period.
While Honda Cars recovered in terms of sequential sales volumes, its Japanese counterpart, Toyota Kirloskar, took a cue and showed a jump in November sales. During the month, Toyota sold 12,175 vehicles, a 19.2% jump over the year-ago period.
M&M sold 13,765 vehicles in November in the domestic market, a decline of 17.9% from the year-ago period. M&M had sold 19,254 passenger vehicles in October this year.
On the commercial vehicle front, a firm indicator of the economy, Tata Motors, which enjoys a dominant market share in the segment, saw sales slide. The company saw commercial vehicle volumes decline 5.2% to 25,406 vehicles compared with the year-ago period. On a sequantial basis, the truckmaker saw volumes dip 6.7% to 27,429 vehicles during the month. However, medium and heavy commercial vehicles (M&HCV) continued to be the silver lining as volumes jumped 39% to 9,452 units in November over the year-ago period.
Rival Ashok Leyland, on a smaller base, delivered a 44% jump in volumes to 7,732 vehicles.

Manic Monday brings double whammy for Vijay MallyaConcerted effort to manipulate machinery: Court in coal case
Troubles are compounding thick and fast for the beleaguered UB Group’s chairman Vijay Mallya, who stepped down as chairman of Mangalore Chemicals and Fertilizers (MCF) on Monday and might have to step down as managing director of the group’s defunct airline Kingfisher Airlines soon.
On Monday morning, MCF said in a filing to the bourses that Mallya was resigning from the board of the company, which is in the middle of a protracted takeover battle, “with immediate effect.” The company didn’t cite any reason for Mallya’s decision to step down.
On the same day, Kingfisher Airlines informed the bourses that the ministry of corporate affairs had rejected its application seeking approval to reappoint Mallya as managing director of the company for a period of five years, albeit the reappointment was proposed without any remuneration payable to Mallya.
The MCA’s refusal to allow Mallya to continue as Kingfisher Airlines’ managing director and his stepping down as MCF chairman may be linked to the action initiated by the airline’s lenders to classify Mallya as a wilful defaulter — a move against which Mallya has obtained a stay from the Calcutta High Court.
UCO Bank had declared the UB Group chairman as a wilful defaulter while other lenders like State Bank of India and Punjab National Bank have issued showcause notices asking why they shouldn’t follow UCO Bank’s lead.
“RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has set the tone when he said that wilful defaulters will no longer be tolerated in the system. Banks have to put pressure on a company with a wilful defaulter on the board,” said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director of InGovern Research Services, an independent proxy advisory and corporate governance research firm.
“He’s fighting different battles and the funding is drying up,” said a person who has been closely involved with the UB Group. He declined to be identified.
While the group’s parent company United Breweries Holdings is contesting several winding-up petitions in the Karnataka High Court, lenders have been selling pledged shares, which has dwindled Mallya’s shareholding in key companies.
Kingfisher Airlines, once India’s second largest, was saddled with a net debt of Rs 9,118 crore as on September 30, and hasn’t been in a financial position to even pay employees’ salaries. The carrier has been grounded since October 2012, after posting huge losses over several quarters. It has never posted an annual profit since it took off in 2005.
Lenders have still not been able to recover a large part of their dues from Kingfisher Airlines despite attaching properties, such as its headquarters in Mumbai’s Vile Parle area and Mallya’s villa in Goa. Mallya’s past attempts to raise equity by selling a stake in the carrier have also failed to materialise.
Had Mallya continued as MCF chairman and the wilful defaulter tag stuck to him, it would have been difficult for the company, which is in sound financial health, to raise debt from lenders, as per regulations.
Mallya’s ally and friend, Kolkata-based businessman Saroj Poddar, and his company Zuari Agro Chemicals might play a larger role in MCF’s management in Mallya’s absence, and fill the position left vacant by him on the fertiliser manufacturer’s board.
Mallya and Poddar are pitted against Pune-based Deepak Fertilisers Petrochemicals Corp in a takeover battle for MCF. Upon the conclusion of their respective open offers last month, Deepak Fertilisers has a 32% stake in the company and Mallya and Poddar jointly own 38%. Mallya and Poddar have been able to retain control of MCF for the time being.
The fertiliser company was the only remaining big entity of the UB Group in which Mallya held a majority stake following Diageo’s acquisition of United Spirits (USL) in 2013. The British liquor firm controls 54.78% of USL while Dutch brewer Heineken has marginally increased its stake in UBL by buying up Mallya’s pledged shares sold by lenders.
But investors appear to have lost faith in the promoters of firms like USL as well.
On November 28, shareholders of USL voted against the majority of the special resolutions moved by the company — pertaining to related party transactions — at its extraordinary general meeting (EGM) in Bangalore. As many as nine of the 12 special resolutions were defeated during a ballot.
In a note issued on November 24, ahead of USL’s AGM, proxy advsiory firm Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IIAS) stated that: “Several of these transactions showcase the audacity of the management in taking minority shareholders for granted. Not only is the timing of some of these transactions questionable, but the nature of the transactions too.”
Meanwhile, the country’s two main stock exchanges, BSE and NSE, have suspended the trading of Kingfisher Airlines’ shares on their platform from Monday, for failing to comply with rules on reporting financial results.
The airline’s stock was trading at Rs 1.34 apiece on November 28, its last trading day.
Kingfisher Airlines got listed on the BSE and NSE on June 12, 2006. The airline’s stock traded its highest on BSE on December 19, 2007, at Rs 335 per share.

Kris invests $160 000 in Lookup  which aspires to be WhatsApp of small businessConcerted effort to manipulate machinery: Court in coal case
Infosys co-founder Kris Gopalakrishnan, who finished his innings at the IT major in October, is back on the circuit. The former CEO has invested in a chat message app, Lookup, which helps small businesses chat with consumers. The funding, amounting to $160,000, will be used by the startup — its first funding after starting out in October — to expand to other metros in the country beyond Bengaluru, where it runs its operations today.
Deepak Ravindran, the founder who refers to Gopalakrishnan as his mentor, told FE that Indian consumers seem to prefer messaging apps over social networks and voice: “We plan to become the Whatsapp for small businesses. This takes the services being offered by Just Dial to an app model. The consumer number here is protected unlike the other
messaging apps.”
A month back, Gopalakrishnan had announced setting up an incubator, Axilor Ventures, along with Infosys cofounder S Shibulal and another company veteran Srinath Batni. The venture will mentor and back early-stage technology ventures as well as invest up to $1 million in the startups they pick. Gopalakrishnan also acts as a mentor at Kochi-based Startup Village, an incubator for telecom and technology startups.
“We are getting queries from other cities, Kerala and Dubai. We will use this money for marketing and in attracting shopkeepers to come on board,” Ravindran told FE. For Ravindran, this is his third startup after Innoz, an SMS-based offline search engine and Q&A app Quest.
He said that consumers and mom-and-pop stores will like to chat with each other regarding the availability of certain goods and services. He said this was a big opportunity and can be used even for making reservations and queries. “There could be a doctor or a restaurant just around the corner, with who you may want to make an appointment or reservation. Lookup will help you do that.”
The company has partnered many local restaurants, pubs, grocery stores, spas, medical shops, gyms, pet stores, electronics and mobile stores and jewellery stores for the service. Around 150 verified small businesses are online whereas the firm answers on behalf of other shops. Lookup gets more than a thousand queries a day now, mostly by college-goers on internship. The app is currently available on Android Play Store and it will launch the app on Apple’s App Store as well.

Formula 1 driver Derek Bell was committed to the moment at hand. (Colorsport/Corbis)
When Formula 1 driver Derek Bell stepped into a race car and switched on the ignition, life's distractions melted away.
Bell, who raced from 1968 to 1996 for teams including Ferrari and McLaren, would think of nothing for the next few hours but tire pressure, how much gas he had left, and how the car felt going into a turn. Nothing but the track.

The worst bonuses ever
“The experience of being totally committed, being totally into every detail of driving, it’s like a Zen experience,” recalled Bell, a native of Britain now living in Boca Raton, Florida. “You never get a chance to lose your concentration because driving takes every ounce of it."
The focus Bell experienced in his race car, of being so committed to the moment at hand, can equal success in business too. These days it’s called living in the moment or being mindful. And while mindfulness might sound like management speak, research shows having an intense focus on a particular task — rather than multitasking — can make you more productive and effective at work.
As a manager, it means creating ways to help your staff intensely focus on their work, said Michael Chaskalson, an author and mindfulness expert. “It’s about managing your attention and the attention of your staff to the present moment,” Chaskalson said.
Since living in the moment isn’t something that’s taught in most schools, Chaskalson recommends training programs on mindfulness, usually eight-week sessions that incorporate everything from meditation-based breathing techniques to neuroscience-based methods to improve focus and productivity. The companies that do this already include Apple, Deutsche Bank, General Mills and Google.
Working mindfully means giving up on the idea of multitasking, said Theresa Glomb, professor of organisational behaviour at the University of Minnesota’s Carlson School of Management. That’s right: the idea of doing a bunch of things at once is a great recipe for doing a bunch of things poorly, with none of them getting the full attention they deserve. “This leaves managers in a constant state of distraction,” Glomb said.
Consider that open-door policy many managers today have striven to adopt. While it promotes creativity by allowing a manager to be more accessible , the downside is constant interruptions, making focusing on work difficult. Instead, Glomb suggested that managers create office hours, like university professors. If that doesn’t work, simply ask the employee to come back at a later time that suits you — and your work.
When it’s impossible to ignore an interruption, Glomb recommends keeping track of where you were. Quickly jot down three ideas about the task and what you were about to do next so you can seamlessly pick up again where you left off.
Living in the moment also means setting routines, Glomb said. Start your day by prioritising your work load. Big or difficult tasks should be handled first thing, when your attention is at its most acute. As for emails and less important meetings, save them for later in the day. And, before leaving work, make tomorrow’s “to do” list or open documents you need to work on the next morning.
“Mindfulness doesn’t need to be sitting on a cushion and meditating,” Glomb said. “Sometimes it’s just about pausing and reflecting and thinking about your next direction.”
Bell, the two-time World Sportscar Championship and five-time LeMans winner, remembers when thinking about his next move meant keeping himself alive. It was like that in France in 1995 during a rainy 24 Hours of LeMans, the endurance race with three drivers taking turns behind the wheel. Bell was about to head into the pits to switch drivers when his crew came on the radio. His replacement was too tired and couldn’t take over. Bell had to continue. 
“The attention needed to drive in the rain all night long, it was intense,” recalled Bell, whose team finished third that year. “You either needed to have all your focus or you would be in trouble.”
That was easier for Bell, a seasoned veteran, than younger drivers. At first, drivers struggle with all the dials and knobs in a cockpit, constantly monitoring the gas, and always being worried about how the brakes feel.
“When you start, everything is compartmentalised, and you always have to go through a mental checklist,” Bell said. “All these things come naturally as you get older, and you start just doing things without thinking of it because you’ve honed that attention.”
Imagine then as a manager doing the same thing: every task in front of you gets nothing but your complete focus — and then your complete confidence as well.

Feigning ignorance of Amit Shah won’t help
21
By Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay
Accusations and counter charges currently being traded between the BJP and Trinamool Congress over involvement of key leaders in various Ponzi schemes is the public dimension of the battle between the two for the political terrain of West Bengal. The manner in which political events are unfolding in the state seeks to redraw the configuration of politics. This re-jigging is underway mainly because of the entry of the BJP as a significant political force.
Let there be no doubt that Mamata Banerjee knows who Amit Shah is. A year ago she may not have been accused of being in denial mode had this query been framed then. But West Bengal is now fast moving towards a situation where TMC and BJP become main rivals. If that happens it will jeopardise the raison d’être of existence for Congress and CPM-led Left Front. In any future poll in the state – civic, assembly or parliamentary – emergence of the BJP as a principal pole would herald marginalisation of these two.
Barely ten months ago, in February to be precise, it was presumed that the Modi wave surged only in spirited evenings in Kolkata’s high-end colonial style clubs. Even the BJP pointsman for West Bengal, Varun Gandhi, did not display significant enthusiasm at Narendra Modi’s public meeting in Kolkata. That he paid the price for this is a different matter.
There of course was reason for scepticism over Modi’s ability to make a dent in West Bengal. In the early 1990s when LK Advani spearheaded the BJP campaign against illegal migrants from Bangladesh, he found considerable resonance on the issue but with no organisational backing, BJP remained at the mercy of Gorkha allies or the TMC which was also part of the NDA government at one time.
Such plight was despite the fact that West Bengal elected three MPs from the BJP’s predecessor Jana Sangh and Hindu Mahasabha in 1951-52. But two of these – Syama Prasad Mukherjee and NC Chatterjee were stalwarts on their own right and could have won without organisational support. Subsequently, the Jana Sangh withered in the state and Chatterjee lost three consecutive elections before securing another term in Lok Sabha in 1967. The Burdwan seat too became a bastion of CPM though remaining with the Chatterjee family when son Somnath won it in 1972.
Decline set in on the Jana Sangh after Mukherjee’s death because it was bereft of mass leaders of eminence. The 1960s saw emergence of radicalism and this weaned urban youth from other parties. Yet, despite the decline of the Jana Sangh, a significant anti-Muslim sentiment remained embedded in West Bengal’s social and political discourse. However this found no political articulation.
Sunday’s rally does not demonstrate Amit Shah’s emergence as a new mass leader. He remains what he was always – a proxy for Modi. But the rally underscored that the 17% odd vote the BJP secured – along with two seats – in the parliamentary polls, was not fluke performance. The cementing of the BJP presence in the state is mainly due to a combination of two factors: Modi’s charisma and the party’s majoritarian agenda.
Yet, neither of these are the only reasons for Muslims to seek the BJP. In a state where political vengeance and violence has become ingrained, groups who require protection from sarkari goons are turning to BJP because CPM can no longer provide it. The state has a huge Muslim presence and like in the rest of the country they are not a homogenous group. Different groups respond diversely and not much can be read into presence of Muslims in BJP meetings. It is surely not an endorsement of the party’s majoritarian programme.
The BJP will have a tough time in securing Hindu support for Modi’s proposal to push through the landswap deal with Bangladesh. This is likely to be balanced by a quiet burial of its support for Gorkhaland on the lines of its united-Maharashtra promise. Less than two years away from an election that could become a watershed, Mamata Banerjee needs to focus on governance, security and rein unruly cadre. Or else the BJP will be on a roll in the state.

Property  fire insurance premiums to rise from 2015Property, fire insurance premium set to rise from next year
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: December 3, 2014  | 09:04 IST
After hardening of premium under group health insurance three months ago, property and fire segments are also set to witness increase in premium rates from the next calendar year.
"We do see the hardening of property and fire insurance segments beginning from the new calendar year. However, I can't tell you to what extent the premiums are likely to go up into the sector as it will vary from company to company," New India Assurance Chairman cum Managing Director, G Srinivasan told reporters.
He was speaking on the occasion of the launch of New India Top-up Mediclaim.
"Market has already hardened in the group health insurance sector for past 2-3 months, so as to bring it in line with the burning cost of the insurers. However, it will have positive impact on the bottomline of his company. Premium hardening has taken place in group health insurance after 3-4 years. Premium rates are slightly catching up with the underwriting," he said.
According to him, New India Assurance has already underwritten premium to the tune of Rs 2,300 crore under the health insurance segment in the first half of the current fiscal, ending September 30 and it was looking at crossing the mark of Rs 4000 crore by the end of the fiscal.
Talking about the health insurance loss ratio in his company, Srinivasan said that it was at 89 per cent during the first half of the current fiscal, as compared to the mark of 97 per cent during the corresponding period last fiscal.
"It is coming down as more and more people are coming under the health insurance coverage in the country," he said.
New India has paid Rs 200 crore claim in case of J&K floods and Rs 490 crore in case of Hudhud cyclone, which include the amount of Rs 40 crore claim paid by the company to Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited in Visakhapatnam alone so far, he said.
"However, our net loss in each of the two cases was at Rs 50 crore only due to the fact that remaining cost was incurred by our reinsurers," he said adding, "Property insurance under the catastrophe category has started hardening after the two catastrophes."
On New India Top-up Mediclaim, he said, "It is available for a maximum sum insured of Rs 15,00,000 on the threshold of Rs 5,00,000 and maximum sum insured of Rs 22,00,000 on the threshold of Rs 8,00,000. The new policy is available to all the people up to the age of 65."
The company has collected global premium of Rs 7,728 crore for the first half of the current fiscal at a growth rate of 13 per cent and the company made a profit of Rs 899 crore during this period, a rise of 40 per cent over the corresponding period of the previous year, he said.
"My company is targeting a global premium of Rs 16,300 crore by the fiscal end," he added.

BJP’s social coalition cracking in Gujarat? CM Anandiben Patel may be undoing what PM Narendra Modi did
DP Bhattacharya, ET Bureau Dec 2, 2014, 04.00AM IST

Ahmedabad
(As long as Narendra Modi…)
GANDHINAGAR: Did Hira Solanki's recent public display of wrath reflect possible cracks in the social coalition that the ruling BJP has put together over the past decade or so in Gujarat? As long as Narendra Modi was chief minister, he was able to keep a lid on community divisions and make sure these didn't spill over, say political observers. But now that he's moved to Delhi as PM, CM Anandiben Patel may be having a tough time making sure everybody gets along.
State assembly member Solanki is the younger brother of Purshottam Solanki , said to be involved in a Rs 400-crore fisheries scam and an exstate cabinet minister. He was recently inducted into the government but only as an MoS that his younger brother construed as an insult to the Koli community that the family belongs to. The younger Solanki organised a community meeting on the outskirts of Ahmedabad and sought an appointment with the CM. It's learnt that Solanki was pacified after being assured that members of the community will get adequate representation in board and corporation.
Not everyone can have the kind of firm grip that Modi had on local affairs, said a member of his party.
"While Narendrabhai in the last 12 years could maintain a strong grip over the community based politics, it is not easy for everyone to have similar control," said a senior BJP worker from Saurashtra . "What we are seeing now in Gujarat is the obvious fallout of the power transition."
The dominant community in Gujarat is that of the Patels or Patidars. It was their alienation from Congress in the mid-eighties, due to the infamous KHAM (Kshatriya, Harijan, Adivasi, Muslim) experiment by ex-CM Madhavsinh Solanki, that fuelled BJP's rise in the state.
The community has benefited from BJP rule, says sociologist Gaurang Jani. For instance, seven of the 23 members of the newly expanded Gujarat cabinet are members of the community. "Other communities are waiting for their share of development," Jani said. "With no big elections in the vicinity, there are appointments in various positions to be made and positions filled up, so such caste-based muscle-flexing will continue... In the process, the communities will also try to firm up their positions for better bargaining power for the next election as well." Patels argue that such consolidation is necessary in the Indian context.
"Every community has its own aspirations and requirements. What is happening in Gujarat can be called casteist," said Naresh Patel, one of the bestknown members of the community. He runs the Khodal Dham temple, a nerve centre of Patidar politics. "At the ground level, there is not much of option as the reality here is unlike western democracies, where everyone stands on equal footing," he said. "Through such experiments, strong leaders may emerge and that eventually may benefit the community."
Others sections are looking to emulate the kind of sway the Patels have.
"The communities have their own political awareness and aspirations and through such experiments, people are testing the waters," said the BJP member from Saurashtra.
Discontent is also simmering among the Brahmins. They believe no powerful leader from the community, from Haren Pandiya to Harin Pathak, has been allowed to rise.

Cong issues booklet citing list of U-turns by Modi govtAjay Maken
(Among the major U-turns…)
NEW DELHI: The Congress has issued a booklet listing a series of 'U-turns' the Modi government has taken on policy issues in the last six months. Comparing the government's present stand with BJP's stated position before polls, Congress charged the NDA regime with "blatant opportunism" in proposing what it had opposed during the UPA era and for not implementing what it had sought while in Opposition.
Releasing a 'report card' of Modi government's 180-day performance, in New Delhi on Monday, AICC general secretary Ajay Maken said the Modi government had done as many as 25 'U-turns' during 180 days in power. "At an average, this government has done a U-turn in every seven to eight days. If the last NDA regime of Vajpayee was known as a roll-back government, the Modi government has become a U-turn government," Ajay Maken said.
Among the major U-turns listed in the Congress booklet are BJP-led government's failure to keep the promise of bringing back black money within 100 days of assuming power, revealing names of all with illegal bank accounts and depositing `15 lakh in family bank accounts.
Listing the number of cross-border incursions by China and Pakistan since the Modi government took charge, Congress recalled how top BJP leaders had accused the UPA regime of "not being effective in safeguarding" Indian soil from incursions.
"Under NDA, the country also had the ignominy of being attacked from the Chinese side right when PM was holding talks with Chinese leader Xi in New Delhi," he said.
The booklet also recalled how BJP had opposed UPA regime's resolve for swapping land enc l a v e s w i t h Bangladesh and how the Modi regime was now moving to implement the same. Congress pointed out that BJP having demanded total disclosure of official files on Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose's mysterious death, was now stonewalling RTI inquiry on the same subject.
'Flip-flop' on negotiations with Pakistan after calling off talks over Pakistan's invitation to Kashmiri separatists was another 'U-turn' of the Narendra Modi government listed in the booklet.

Rohtak eve-teasing: Govt sacks driver  conductorPeshawar school attack: Pakistani pupils recall narrow escapes, carnage in Taliban slaughter
Haryana government has suspended the driver and conductor of the roadways bus in which two college-going sisters were eve-teased by three youths.
The Director General of Haryana Transport department has ordered to suspend bus driver Balwan Singh and conductor Labh Singh of bus with registration no-HR 69 6150 with immediate effect, an official order issued in this regard said.
The suspension order issued by Haryana Roadways General Manager, Sonepat came after two sisters were eve-teased by three men in the moving bus on Rohtak-Sonepat road on Friday.
Taking serious note of this incident, Haryana government has also asked state Director General of Police (DGP) and state transport department to take steps for ensuring safety and security of passengers especially women travelling in the Haryana roadways buses.
The bus drivers and conductors have also been directed to make sure that such incidents do not occur in future, it said.
The two college-going sisters had confronted three eve-teasers inside a moving bus, with one of the girls even hitting the youths with her belt, even as passengers remained mute spectators.
The entire incident, recorded by a passenger on mobile phone, went viral both on television and social media. It showed the two girls using hand and belt to thrash the eve teasers, who appeared to be taken by surprise.
All the three youths — Kuldeep, Mohit and Deepak – were later arrested.
The parents of the two girls lodged an FIR with Haryana police against the three youths informing that the molesters got down at the Kansla village in Rohtak.
The victims in their complaint alleged that they were “teased” by some youths in a Haryana Roadways bus when they were going to their college on Friday.
When the victims objected, one of the accused started beating them up.
The father of the two sisters alleged that there was pressure from the panchayat that the girls should withdraw the complaint.

RBI retains growth estimate at 5.5% for 2014-15economic policy
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has retained its growth estimate for 2014-15 at 5.5 per cent.
The reiteration of growth estimate is based on its expectation of a normal monsoon. Also, the apex bank is hopeful that there will not be any adverse supply or financial shocks.
While keeping the policy rates unchanged in its fifth bi-monthly policy, the RBI said conditions for a turnaround "are gathering." Nevertheless, it did concede that "activity appears to have lost some momentum in Q2, probably extending into Q3."
The RBI pointed to the softening of inflation, easing of commodity prices/ input costs, comfortable liquidity conditions, and rising business confidence as well as purchasing activity.
"These conditions could enable a pick-up in Q4 if co-ordinated policy efforts fructify in dispelling the drag on the economy emanating from structural constraints,’’ it said.
"A durable revival of investment demand continues to be held back by infrastructural constraints and lack of assured supply of key inputs, in particular coal, power, land and minerals,’’ it said. The success of ongoing government actions in these areas wouldl be key to reviving growth and offsetting downside risks emanating from agriculture – in view of weaker-than-expected Rabi sowing – and exports – given the sluggishness in external demand, it added.
The apex bank said some easing of monetary conditions had already taken place. The weighted average call rates as well as long-term yields for government and high-quality corporate issuances had moderated substantially since end-August, it said. "However, these interest rate impulses have yet to be transmitted by banks into lower lending rates,’’ it pointed. Slow bank credit growth was mirrored by increasing reliance of large corporations on commercial paper and domestic as well as external public issuances, it pointed out.
It admitted that weak demand and the rapid pace of recent disinflation were factors supporting monetary accommodation. "The weak transmission by banks of the recent fall in money market rates into lending rates, however, suggests monetary policy shifts will primarily have signaling effects for a while," it said. These signaling effects wre likely to be large since the Reserve Bank had repeatedly indicated that once the monetary policy stance shifted, subsequent policy actions would be consistent with the changed stance. "There is still some uncertainty about the evolution of base effects in inflation, the strength of the on-going disinflationary impulses, the pace of change of the public’s inflationary expectations, as well as the success of the government’s efforts to hit deficit targets," it cautioned. As such, a change in the monetary policy stance at the current juncture was premature, it said. "However, if the current inflation momentum and changes in inflationary expectations continue, and fiscal developments are encouraging, a change in the monetary policy stance is likely early next year, including outside the policy review cycle," the RBI said.

RBI policy review: Raghuram Rajan effects no rate cut; hope lost for lower EMIsGovt considering 6 FDI proposals in single-brand retail
Home and auto loans will not become cheaper as the Governor Raghuram Rajan-led Reserve Bank of India (RBI) kept the policy rate unchanged for the fifth time in a row today, but hinted at softening of stance “early next year” if inflation continues to abate and there is an improvement in fiscal health.
The decision to keep the short term lending (repo) rate unchanged at 8 per cent disappointed the industry which said RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan in his fifth bi-monthly policy statement could had been more accommodating to help prop up the sagging economy.
“A change in the monetary policy stance at the current juncture is premature. However, if the current inflation momentum and changes in inflationary expectations continue, and fiscal developments are encouraging, a change in the monetary policy stance is likely early next year, including outside the policy review cycle,” he said.
ANALYSTS’ COMMENTARY: ‘Change in stance by Raghuram Rajan’s RBI very heartening’
RBI POLICY REVIEW: HIGHLIGHTS
The repo rate continues to be at 8 per cent while the cash reserve ratio has also been retained at 4 per cent.
Following the policy announcement, most of the bankers said that there will be no change in lending and deposit rates for now.
United Bank of India Executive Director Deepak Narang said the margins of banks are already under pressure due to high level of non-performing assets (NPAs) or bad loans.
“So, I don’t see a cut in the interest rate at the moment,” he added.
Following the RBI stance, the BSE’s 30-share index Sensex closed at 28,444, down 115.61 points or 0.40 per cent.
On the inflation trajectory, Rajan said he expects it to ease further and average at the 6 per cent.
“Over the next 12-month period, inflation is expected to retain some momentum and hover around 6 per cent, except for seasonal movements, as the disinflation momentum works through,” he said in the bi-monthly review of the monetary policy.
Driven largely by a base-effect, the consumer price inflation for October had come in at 5.52 per cent, the fifth consecutive month that it declined.
Poor showing by agriculture and manufacturing sector pulled down the country’s economic growth rate to 5.3 per cent in the second quarter, as against 5.7 per cent in the April-June quarter of the current financial year.
Under its glide path, the RBI is targeting to get the CPI inflation at 8 per cent as of January 2015 and take it down to 6 per cent by January 2016. While the 2015 target is achievable, Rajan had in the last policy sounded concerned about the “upside risks” to the 2016 target.
Central forecast for retail inflation is revised downward to 6 per cent from 8 per cent for March 2015.
Calls for a rate cut had been growing in the run up to the policy announcement, with Finance Minister Arun Jaitley also pitching for lowering the cost of capital to boost growth.
However, the surprising rebound displayed with a 6.3 per cent growth in the core sector yesterday – indicating an uptick in factory output – had kept everybody guessing about the stance which Rajan adopts.
Additionally, the auto companies also reported an over 10 per cent growth in sales for November, after a dip in the preceding month, indicating a revival in the manufacturing sector. Among the eight core sectors, coal and power have done exceedingly well during the month.
The lobby calling for a rate cut had also been pointing to a continuous decline in global crude prices, which have come to a 5-year low of around USD 68 a barrel, which has the potential to reduce inflation in an oil-importing nation like India.
However, some experts also warn of uncertainty continuing over oil pricing, saying that any geo-political tension will send the prices up again.
India’s RBI leaves rates on hold, says could ease early 2015
(Reuters) The Reserve Bank of India held interest rates steady as widely expected at a policy review on Tuesday, and said it could ease monetary policy early next year provided inflationary pressures do not reappear and the government controls the fiscal deficit.
Uneasy over India’s weak recovery from its slowest phase of growth since the 1980s, the six-month-old government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi had been seen as favouring an early reduction in rates.
The finance ministry said later in a statement it looked forward to the RBI’s support in “the revival of growth and employment” while adding it would work with the RBI on reducing inflationary expectations and reviving investment and growth.
RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has resisted calls for rate cuts and earlier reiterated his view that containing inflation was a prerequisite for the economy.
“What again and again we have seen in India, and outside India also, is that the way to sustainable growth is to have moderate inflation,” Rajan told a news conference.
Forty-one of 45 economists polled by Reuters had forecast that the RBI would keep the repo rate at 8.00 percent, while four had expected a reduction of 25 basis points.
The RBI’s next policy review is in early February, and most analysts had expected the central bank would either cut interest rates then or wait until April.
“A change in the monetary policy stance at the current juncture is premature,” the RBI said in its statement.
“However, if the current inflation momentum and changes in inflationary expectations continue, and fiscal developments are encouraging, a change in the monetary policy stance is likely early next year, including outside the policy review cycle.”
Rajan told a teleconference with analysts that the central bank wants to be confident that underlying trends for non-food inflation were moving in the right direction before reducing interest rates.
India’s benchmark 10-year bond yield fell 5 basis points on the day to 8.01 percent as investors cheered the central bank’s more dovish stance.
ECONOMY NEEDS MORE THAN RATE CUT
In its statement, the RBI spoke of the need to revive capital investment, and called on the government, which will announce its budget in February, to “stay on course” to meet fiscal deficit targets. Those targets have been jeopardised by  weak tax revenue growth and the slow pace in selling off stakes in state-run companies to raise funds.
Data released on Friday showed economic growth slipped to 5.3 percent year-on-year in the July-September quarter, down from 5.7 percent in the previous quarter. India needs far faster growth to create jobs for all the young people joining its workforce in coming years.
“Things will not pick up just because of rate cuts,” said J. Venkatesan, an equity fund manger for Sundaram Asset Management in Chennai. “A strong reforms push is needed to revive economic growth.”
Helped by tumbling oil prices, India’s annual consumer price inflation (CPI) slowed to 5.52 percent in October, sharply down from a peak of 11.16 percent struck in November last year, but the RBI warned that it expected inflation to rise in December as a favourable base effect wanes.
The RBI has targeted CPI at 6 percent for January 2016, and the central bank said risks to the target “appear evenly balanced under the current policy stance”.
Rajan said if that target was achieved the RBI would then aim for a longer-term inflation target of 4 percent.
While there were few expectations that the RBI would cut interest rates this time, officials had told Reuters last week that Finance Minister Arun Jaitley would press Rajan for a reduction when they held a customary meeting before the policy review – though there was no confirmation that the meeting took place.
The central bank is not statutorily independent from the finance ministry, but it enjoys broad autonomy in setting monetary policy, though there are plans to amend the RBI Act and incorporate a monetary policy committee that gives voting rights to officials both within and outside the central bank.
“In the weeks ahead, the government and RBI will work towards a monetary policy framework that will help institutionalize the gains achieved on the inflation front, so as to reduce inflationary expectations and further support the revival of investment and growth,” the ministry said.
 

You can soon bury your DNA on Moon!India ranks 65th on tourism competitiveness index
A British space consultant will charge people 50 pounds or so to place a sample of their DNA in an archive to be buried on the Moon.
Called Lunar Mission One, the archive is the brainchild of David Iron, who has worked on Skynet, the UK spy satellite network, and Galileo, the European Union’s global positioning system.
He will offer people a chance to place a sample of their DNA, in the form of a strand of hair, in an archive to be buried on the Moon, alongside a digital history of as much of their lives as they want to record.
However, Iron needs at least 10 million people to do this if he is to generate the 500 million pounds the moon shot will need, ‘New Scientist’ reported.
Iron and his colleagues have launched a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter to raise the initial 600,000 pounds of seed funding needed to set up the company to commission designs for the spacecraft, which it is hoped will blast off in 2024.
Iron is working with the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Harwell, UK.
Lunar Mission One plans to land a robotic spacecraft on the Moon’s south pole. It will then drill at least 20 metres into the lunar crust, extracting core samples to be analysed on the craft.
“No lunar or planetary mission of any kind has ever drilled to a significant depth below the surface. The deepest Apollo drill core was only 3 metres long,” said Ian Crawford at Birkbeck College, London, Lunar Mission One’s chief planetary scientist.
“The drill will enable the geothermal gradient, and thus lunar heatflow, to be measured for the first time,” Crawford said.
After about six months, capsules containing the DNA and digital data will be injected into the borehole, which will then be sealed.

First observation of super-Earth using ground telescopeIndia ranks 65th on tourism competitiveness index
In an astronomical first, a ground-based telescope has observed a super-Earth planet passing in front of a bright, nearby Sun-like star.
The transit of the exoplanet 55 Cancri e is the shallowest detected from the ground yet, researchers said.
Since detecting a transit is the first step in analysing a planet’s atmosphere, this success bodes well for characterising the many small planets that upcoming space missions are expected to discover in the next few years.
The international research team used the 2.5-meter Nordic Optical Telescope on the island of La Palma, Spain, a moderate-sized facility by today’s standards but equipped with state-of-the-art instruments, to make the detection.
Previous observations of this planet transit had to rely on space-borne telescopes.
The host star, 55 Cancri, is located just 40 light-years away from us and is visible to the naked eye. During its transit, the planet crosses 55 Cancri and blocks a tiny fraction of the starlight, dimming the star by 1/2000th for almost two hours.
This shows that the planet is about twice the size of Earth, or 16,000 miles in diameter.
“Our observations show that we can detect the transits of small planets around Sun-like stars using ground-based telescopes,” said lead author of the study, Ernst de Mooij of Queen’s University Belfast in the UK.
“This is especially important because upcoming space missions such as TESS and PLATO should find many small planets around bright stars and we will want to follow up the discoveries with ground-based instruments,” he said.
TESS is a NASA mission scheduled for launch in 2017, while PLATO is to be launched in 2024 by the European Space Agency; both will search for transiting terrestrial planets around nearby bright stars.
“With this result we are also closing in on the detection of the atmospheres of small planets with ground-based telescopes,” said co-author Mercedes Lopez-Morales of the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics (CfA).
“We are slowly paving the way towards the detection of bio-signatures in Earth-like planets around nearby stars,” said Lopez-Morales.
The planet 55 Cancri e is about twice as big and eight times as massive as Earth. With a period of 18 hours, it is the innermost of five planets in the system.
Because of its proximity to the host star, the planet’s dayside temperature reaches over 1700 degrees Celsius, hot enough to melt metal, with conditions far from hospitable to life.

Human eye can see  invisible  infrared lightAny science textbook will tell you that humans cannot see infrared light, but researchers have found that under certain conditions our eyes can actually detect the ‘invisible’ light.
Like X-rays and radio waves, infrared light waves are outside the visual spectrum.
Using cells from the retinas of mice and people, and powerful lasers that emit pulses of infrared light, the researchers found that when laser light pulses rapidly, light-sensing cells in the retina sometimes get a double hit of infrared energy.
When that happens, the eye is able to detect light that falls outside the visible spectrum.
“We’re using what we learned in these experiments to try to develop a new tool that would allow physicians to not only examine the eye but also to stimulate specific parts of the retina to determine whether it’s functioning properly,” said senior investigator Vladimir J Kefalov, associate professor of ophthalmology and visual sciences at Washington University.
The study was initiated after scientists reported seeing occasional flashes of green light while working with an infrared laser.
Unlike the laser pointers used in lecture halls or as toys, the powerful infrared laser the scientists worked with emits light waves thought to be invisible to the human eye.
“They were able to see the laser light, which was outside of the normal visible range, and we really wanted to figure out how they were able to sense light that was supposed to be invisible,” said Frans Vinberg, one of the study’s lead authors.
Researchers examined the scientific literature and revisited reports of people seeing infrared light.
They repeated previous experiments in which infrared light had been seen, and they analysed such light from several lasers to see what they could learn about how and why it sometimes is visible.
“We experimented with laser pulses of different durations that delivered the same total number of photons, and we found that the shorter the pulse, the more likely it was a person could see it,” Vinberg said.
“Although the length of time between pulses was so short that it couldn’t be noticed by the naked eye, the existence of those pulses was very important in allowing people to see this invisible light,” Vinberg added.
The findings are published in the journal PNAS.

RBI plays a waiting game
K. T. Jagannathan
money and monetary policy
Though widely anticipated, the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) decision to keep the key policy rates unchanged may have upset many a mind.
The Raghuram Rajan-led team, however, must be lauded for not giving into popular demand. It did well to resist pressures from its political masters. Often time, the RBI found to its dismay that rate cut or liquidity easing takes a longer time to transmit, and reach the tail-end of the customers. In today’s policy statement also the apex bank pointed to the weak transmission by banks of the recent fall in money market rates into lending rates. The weighted average call rates as well as long-term yields for government and high-quality corporate issuances have moderated substantially since end-August.
Yet, to RBI’s frustration, these interest rate impulses have not yet been transmitted by banks into lower lending rates. Corporates, too, go for commercial papers and external public issues. Not surprisingly, there has been only a slow growth in bank credit. Clearly, the issue is more than availability of credit. Infrastructural constraints remain a key hurdle for revival of investment demand. Shortage of critical inputs such as coal and power has aggravated the problem. This is further accentuated by the non-availability of land. All these have combined to magnify the predicament for the economy. The fiscal bosses need to realise their responsibility, and swing into action to rectify these ‘mal-functioning’ or ‘non-functioning’ spheres to bring confidence back. Onus is no less on the political bosses just now. Given this, the RBI is right in asserting that “a change in the monetary policy stance at the current juncture is premature.’’

PM Narendra Modi getting rock star treatment from investorsGovt considering 6 FDI proposals in single-brand retail
With money managers pouring in a whopping USD 16.5 billion in Indian stocks, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is being treated like a rock star by investors around the world, a leading American financial daily has said.
“Investors around the world are giving Modi, and India, the rock star treatment. Money managers have poured USD 16.5 billion into Indian stocks this year, the most of any developing country tracked by the Institute of International Finance,” The Wall Street Journal has reported.
Noting that India’s S&P BSE Sensex has soared 35 per cent this year, closing at a record 54 times in 2014, the daily said investors are betting that Modi will introduce policies to jump-start India’s economy, boosting profits at companies ranging from banks to cement makers.
The paper said economists predict India will expand at a faster rate this year, the only one of the BRIC countries – which include Brazil, Russia and China – expected to accelerate.
The International Monetary Fund expects growth in India to reach 6.4 per cent next year, from 5.6 per cent this year, it said.
For money managers who have to invest billions on behalf of large institutions, India may be one of the last developing economies of its size that can offer steady, highflying returns, the daily said.

Test cricket
India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni is expected to join the team ahead of the rescheduled first Test, commencing in Adelaide on December 9.
Owing to a hand injury, Dhoni had not been named in the original squad for the first Test, earlier scheduled to be played in Brisbane from December 4. He was earlier expected to join the team for the ‘second Test’ in Adelaide, which was originally starting on December 12.
The tragic demise of Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes resulted in the rescheduling of the four-match Test series.
Thus, now the Indian captain will be able to join the team sometime this week, before the Test series begins.
As per the new schedule released by Cricket Australia late last night, the first Test of the four-match series will now be played in Adelaide from December 9-12, while second game will be held at Gabba in Brisbane from December 17-21.
The Boxing Day Test — the third one of the 2014-15 Border-Gavaskar Trophy — was the only Test whose schedule has remained unchanged. It will start in Melbourne on December 26.
The fourth Test will be played in Sydney but with a delay of three days, now starting on January 6 instead of January 3.
The Indian team will be playing its second practice match at the Glenelg Oval in sub-urban Adelaide ahead of the first Test. It will be a two-day game, beginning December 4. The opposition for that tie will be another Cricket Australia XI, though it will expectantly be devoid of any big names since the players are in mourning. India’s second tour-game had got cancelled after Hughes’ death.
Dhoni, however, will be unavailable for the practice game as he is not likely to join before December 4.
Indian team spokesperson Dr. Redhills Baba said that the skipper, though, will join the team well ahead of the first Test, which means stand-in captain Virat Kohli will not lead the side when the series gets underway at the Adelaide Oval.
Meanwhile, Kohli will be attending Hughes’ funeral in the late cricketer’s home-town, Macksville on Wednesday. He will be joined by batsmen Rohit Sharma and Murali Vijay, along with team director Ravi Shastri, coach Duncan Fletcher and team manager Arshad Ayub.
The team management expects Kohli, Sharma and Vijay to return in time for the two-day tour game, which is scheduled on Thursday.
The entire Australian cricketing fraternity will be attending the funeral, which will begin in the afternoon and will be televised by major channels here. The Australian Test squad is then expected to travel to Adelaide on Thursday and then begin preparations for the Test series.
However, Cricket Australia CEO James Sutherland has stated that “any grieving player is free to pull out of the match or indeed the Test series”.
“Right now there’s a funeral tomorrow and let’s just understand that’s going to be difficult enough as it is,” Sutherland said at a press conference this morning in Sydney before departing for Macksville.
“There will be a great temptation for people to speculate about who’s going to play and how they are feeling. I encourage everyone to give the players their space.
“No one will think ill of anyone who feels uncomfortable about playing. Test cricket is a different game. It is not just going out there and playing a game of sport for a couple of hours. You need to go out there and commit to five days. It will be up to the individual. Any player that is not comfortable or doesn’t fell right, or there is medical advice to suggest that they are not quite right, then we will obviously understand that and I am sure the broader public will understand that as well,” he added.
Meanwhile, there will be obvious speculation about Australian skipper Michael Clarke’s participation in the first Test. He had earlier been included in the original squad for the Brisbane Test pending a fitness test, but a small controversy had erupted that saw him at loggerheads with the national selectors over the issue.
National selector Mark Waugh had revealed that Hughes would have been in contention for a Test return if Clarke had been sidelined due to lack of fitness.
Hughes’ death put that issue on the back-burner like everything else, and Clarke has been a great leader off the pitch for Cricket Australia in this time of tragedy. However, it has also not given him any time for rehabilitation and thus, his participation in the opening Test is still a big question mark.

J&K polls: Youth in south Kashmir villages decide not to voteBy: Press Trust of India | Kulgam |
Posted: December 2, 2014 4:28 pm | Updated: December 2, 2014 8:09 pm
Voters in Kashmir have defied the boycott call given by separatists but two villages in the south Kashmir constituency have en masse decided not to take part in the democratic process alleging discrimination in development and harassment by security forces.
Out of 4,521 eligible voters, just one vote was cast at six polling stations of Bugam and Panivah falling in Kulgam Assembly segment in the first three hours of polling.
“We do not have anything to do with the boycott call of Hurriyat Conference. It is the voice of our conscience that we should not vote as our area, which has a population of 15,000 souls, has been discriminated against in every respect during the last 18 years,” Ali Mohammad, an elderly person, said outside the Bugam polling station.
He said that nearby Balosa village was granted a new administrative unit while Bugam was “ignored”.
“Balosa has just 4,000 population. What was the criterion for giving the niabat (sub-Tehsil) to that area?” he asked.
Abdul Gaffar, a local resident, claimed that the area has been fighting for upgradation of the local middle school to high school level for the last 18 years.
“Every time we asked the authorities about the matter, they said our middle school is in the list of schools to be upgraded but every time we were ignored when the list was issued,” he said.
The youth were particularly agitated alleging that several youth were picked up by security forces early in the morning. “This harassment takes place whenever there is an election. What is the crime of the youth?” Umar, a local resident, said.
The security forces personnel deployed at these six polling stations could be seen relaxing in the winter sun.
“Our duty is to maintain law and order. It is the choice of the people whether they vote or not,” Constable Ghulam Hassan said.
The senior security officials, however, interacted with the local elders and urged them to counsel the youth not to disrupt law and order in the area.
While Bugam and Panivah remained peaceful till noon, youth in some adjoining areas – where separatist groups still wield some influence – resorted to stone-pelting on security forces. The miscreants were chased away and there was no disruption in the polling in these areas.

Cancer  Ebola  AIDS  no I prefer road accidents: Stupid reasons to break traffic rulesWritten by Parmita Uniyal | New Delhi |
Posted: December 2, 2014 4:42 pm | Updated: December 2, 2014 4:45 pm
We prefer landing at the hospital than wearing a helmet, we love to multi-task even if it means risking our lives. We don’t have patience to follow traffic signal, for we want to be ahead of everyone. Drinking clearly is more important than reaching home safe.
Old Delhi Films’ latest video – Stupid reasons to break Traffic Rules is an eye opener for people who don’t think of consequences when they break rules after rules on road.
Sample some of the classic excuses:
“Office ke liye late ho raha hota hun tab signal todta hun” (Was getting late for office, that’s why I broke the signal)
“Exam ke liye late ho rahi thi, isliye signa toda tha.” (Was getting late for exams, that’s why I broke the signal)
“Raat ko bhi red light follow karni hoti hai?” (I didn’t know you have to follow red light at night)
“Mere aage waale ne red light jump kari main bhi kar leta hu” (The one ahead of me jumped the signal, so did I)
This one is the ‘best’
“Cancer, Ebols, Aids, no I prefer road accidents”
The hilarious video takes on a serious tone towards the end when the ‘rule-breakers’ give a touching message to the public.
Be safe for the sake of your loved ones, will you?

Bigg Boss 8: Guards and Thieves in the houseBy: Express News Service | Mumbai |
Posted: December 2, 2014 4:46 pm
Day 72 in the ‘Bigg Boss’ house introduces a new luxury budget task of the week named ‘Museum’. Bigg Boss divides the housemates into two groups, Guards and Thieves. Praneet Ali and Karishma are the thieves while Diandra, Gautam, Puneet, Sonali, Upen and Dimpy are the guards of the museum. Captain Pritam is the supervisor of the task. The thieves are required to steal all the items from the Museum, and only then can they steal the ultimate Diamond put up in the middle of the area in order to win the task.
The thieves are busy strategizing as how to steal the antiques in the living area of the house, while the guards gear up in their respective uniforms. Puneet, Dimpy, Gautam and Diandra are in full form to take up their responsibilities. Meanwhile, Sonali and Upen who are in charge of monitoring the Museum through a TV set up in the garden area are in a playful mood. Guards are also given the liberty to put any thief into the jail under suspicion. As per their strategy the Guards, in order to protect their antiques, try to hide and safeguard the items while the thieves plan not to let that happen.
Karishma manages to take one of the antiques and runs inside the Store Room where the robbed items are supposed to be kept.
But as per the rules, before the storeroom door shuts, Puneet stops Karishma and takes away the robbed item, asking Karishma to back off.
Later, Ali and Praneet take turns inside the jail as they try to steal to complete the task. But their efforts are in vain, as the guards are determinedly alert. Ali makes use of hilarious antics in order to distract the guards. The thieves then decide to maintain a low profile during the day and wait for the night to execute their master plans. But, by evening the thieves manage to steal some items. Will the guards make a comeback?

24 naval submarines involved in mishaps since 2011: GovtBy: Press Trust of India | New Delhi |
Posted: December 2, 2014 6:33 pm
There have been 24 mishaps involving Indian naval submarines since 2011, claiming the lives of 22 personnel besides four others going missing, Rajya Sabha was informed on Tuesday.
While Boards of Inquiry (BoIs) have been instituted in all these cases, the findings of the completed BoIs indicate “human error and technical issues as the reasons behind the mishaps”, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar said in reply to a written question.
While three accidents each occured in 2011 and 2012, seven happened in 2013 and 11 till November 6, this year. The accidents in 2013 included the one involving INS Sindhurakshak in which 18 personnel were killed.
In the latest incident in which TRV-72 (torpedo recovery vehicle) sank off Visakhapatnam on November six, one naval personnel lost his life while four others “still remain missing”, Parrikar said, adding six others on board were safely rescued.
To a question on crashes of defence aircraft, he said a total of 24 defence planes have crashed from 2012-13 till November 26, this year.
As many as 32 defence personnel lost their lives in these incidents, while seven others were injured.
The loss to the government in terms of the value of aircraft and service property in respect of 12 of these aircraft, where assessment has been completed, is estimated at Rs 536.98 crore, the Minister said.

It is up to players to decide whether they are ready for first Test: Cricket AustraliaBy: Press Trust of India | Sydney |
Posted: December 2, 2014 6:13 pm | Updated: December 2, 2014 6:22 pm
Cricket Australia (CA) today said it will be up to the players to decide whether they are ready for the “extremely emotional” first cricket Test against India in the the aftermath of Philip Hughes’ demise, as fast bowler Ryan Harris admitted he is unsure about his participation.
CA chief executive James Sutherland said it is too early to speculate which players will be mentally ready to take the field for the re-scheduled first Test in Adelaide next Tuesday.
CA confirmed a series of date changes to Australia’s four-Test series against India on Monday night, prompted by the tragic death of Hughes.
Adelaide Oval will now host the postponed first Test, with the game to start at Hughes’ adopted home ground two weeks after the 25-year-old was felled by a bouncer.
Sutherland, speaking en route to Macksville for Hughes’ funeral tomorrow, said when the time comes it will be up to each squad member to decide whether they’re ready for what shapes as an extremely emotional Test.
“Any player that is not comfortable or doesn’t feel right, or there is medical advice to suggest they’re not quite right, then we will obviously understand that,” Sutherland was quoted by Australia’s AAP news agency as saying.
“I’m sure the broader public will understand that as well. Understand that we and the Australian Cricketers’ Association will be supporting them and nobody will think ill of anyone who feels uncomfortable about it,” Sutherland said.
“Test cricket is a different game, it’s not just going out there and playing a game of sport for a couple of hours it’s a big step,” he said.
Test players David Warner, Shane Watson, Brad Haddin and Nathan Lyon were on the field during last Tuesday’s freak accident at the Sydney Cricket Ground.
Conjecture about the make-up of an XI is usually standard practice before a Test series, but there will be nothing normal about the next week’s match.
“I’m not going to jump ahead to that,” Sutherland said, when asked about players availability.
“There’s a funeral tomorrow, let’s just understand that’s going to be difficult enough as it is. There will be a great temptation for people to speculate about who’s going to play and how they’re feeling, I’d just encourage everyone to give the players their space. Let them, in their own way, work through it,” he said.
Harris, meanwhile, said he had not reached a decision on his return and said many players would have liked longer to come to terms with Hughes’ tragic death.
“Tomorrow (the funeral) is the day we’re all thinking about. The back of our mind is Tuesday and we have to do what we can to prepare for continued…

DoT plans to auction 3G spectrum in Feb: TraiGovt considering 6 FDI proposals in single-brand retail
As the government plans to conduct 3G spectrum auction along with 2G radiowaves sale in February, it has asked telecom regulator Trai to expedite the base price recommendations for it.
“DoT requested Trai to expedite the process for its recommendations on the reserve price of 2100 Mhz band and related issues so that the auction of spectrum in this band could be conducted along with the auction of spectrum in the 800/900/1800 MHz bands scheduled in February 2015,” Trai said.
In the consultation paper today for valuation and reserve price of spectrum in 2100 MHz band, used for 3G services, the regulator has said that the Department of Telecom is in talks with the Defence Ministry for the vacation of the band and there are three possible scenarios under deliberation.
In case one, if no spectrum is released by the Defence, then auction can’t be conducted in this band. The second scenario is that it releases 5 MHz in 17 circles, in that case one block of 5 MHz spectrum will be available for auction in 17 circles.
The third scenario could be the Defence swapping 2100 MHz spectrum with 1900 MHz. In that case, in addition to 5 MHz spectrum in 17 circles, it may release 15 MHz on pan-India basis by swapping 2100 Mhz spectrum with 1900 Mhz.
Telecom companies as well as the regulator have been of the view that the auction should take place only when adequate spectrum is made available, and the bidding should be held simultaneously for both the services – 2G and 3G.
Defence had released 20 MHz out of 25 MHz in 2100 MHz band allocated to DoT under the agreement with Defence on a pan-India basis and one more block of 5 MHz in 5 circles, which was auctioned in 2010.
Under the agreement with DoT, the remaining spectrum is to be vacated only after the alternate communication network is completed.
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India said stakeholders can send their comments regarding 2100 Mhz band auction by December 15 and counter-comments by December 19.
Trai has earlier reiterated its recommendations for 900 and 1800 Mhz bands while it has increased the base price by 15 per cent for 800 MHz band.
The DoT had sent back Trai’s recommendations on 800, 900 and 1800 MHz bands for reconsidering some points.
The next round of spectrum auction is proposed to be held in February and the government is estimated to garner at least Rs 9,355 crore from sale of radiowaves.
As per estimates, auction of spectrum in 2100 Mhz band in February can fetch bids worth at least Rs 5,000 crore.

Trajectory dovish  Modi govt must do its part: AnalystSpeakRBI POLICY REVIEW: HIGHLIGHTS
RADHIKA RAO, ECONOMIST, DBS, SINGAPORE:
The RBI did not relent to market pressure and opted to keep rates unchanged. The policy language has turned neutral as risks to the FY16 target are now seen as evenly balanced, but policymakers were quick to add that durability of readings beyond December will be watched.
We interpret these statements to signal that a decision to lower rates will be data-dependant given the uncertainty over the trajectory for crude prices and challenging fiscal outlook. More importantly, the RBI is wary of policy flip-flops and highlights that if and when the policy direction shifts, the subsequent action needs to be consistent with the changed course.
Hence, further clarity on price outlook will be preferable as base effects fade in first quarter next year. Nonetheless, the door for rate cuts has been left open and is likely to see the market shift rate cut expectations to February’s review.
SANDEEP NANDA, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, BHARTI AXA LIFE INSURANCE, MUMBAI
The policy has come in line with market expectations. There is no rate cut but guidance is definitely dovish. People will now expect rate cuts from February onwards. RBI has brought down its expectations to market’s level. More positive surprises can be expected given the way commodity prices are behaving.
ARVIND CHARI, HEAD OF FIXED INCOME AND ALTERNATIVES, QUANTUM ADVISORS, MUMBAI
We have maintained that the RBI will only move post certainty on growth polices and supply reforms in the budget. We thus expect the first rate cut to be immediately post-budget in the first half of March and it can be a 50 basis point cut.
KILLOL PANDYA, SENIOR FUND MANAGER-DEBT, LIC NOMURA MF
RBI’s policy is very balanced and pragmatic. There should be no complaints from market participants. The policy is dovish relatively so there would be continued expectations of rate cuts in future. The trajectory would remain dovish but government’s needs to do its part.
R.K. GUPTA, MD, TAURUS ASSET MANAGEMENT, NEW DELHI
This is what we were expecting. Probably rates may not be reduced before April 2015. Reducing 25 basis points is not going change anything in the corporate sector. If inflation continues to remain low, foreign currency reserves remain comfortable, current account deficit remains under control, probably you can expect a 50-75 basis point cut in April 2015, after the budget. RBI will take a very, very cautious approach.
SHAKTI SATAPATHY, FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, AK CAPITAL, MUMBAI
Today’s action is aimed at containing the medium-term inflationary pressure and is well in line with the RBI’s sanctity towards its previous tone. However, the tone for today’s policy seems more softer on account of positive developments happening to the intermittent data points. The prolonged low price regime seen in international crude and the government’s effort in containing the fiscal deficit would weigh positive in forthcoming policies of 2015 and might lead to a first rate cut in the first quarter of 2015.
DEVENDRA KUMAR PANT, CHIEF ECONOMIST AND SENIOR DIRECTOR, (HEAD-PUBLIC FINANCE), INDIA RATINGS AND RESEARCH
The policy has come in line with our expectations. There are high chances of a rate cut in Feb 2015. Decline in inflation has come mainly from falling crude oil prices. Oil prices will remain low but may not see a sharp fall next year. Food inflation may also rise due to summer pressure. Base-effect will keep inflation lower until December.
J. VENKATESAN, EQUITY FUND MANAGER, SUNDARAM AMC, CHENNAI
The central bank has made a strong dovish statement. Inflation is clearly trending downwards, and based on that the RBI has clearly stated that the monetary stance will be reviewed early next year. If the interest rate is cut it would be sentimentally beneficial, but things will not pick up just because of rate cuts. A strong reforms push is needed to revive economic growth, that is where the cycle had got stuck.
A. PRASANNA, ECONOMIST, ICICI SECURITIES PRIMARY DEALERSHIP LTD, MUMBAI
This policy is as per expectation. The guidance is dovish which leads us to believe that there is a significant chance of policy easing by February subject to inflation and government’s efforts to meet fiscal targets. At this point we’ll go with 25 basis points. The bond market is running ahead, but there’s more conviction about policy easing by February.
KUMAR RACHAPUDI, SENIOR RATES STRATEGIST, ANZ, SINGAPORE
The RBI assessing the risks to its January 2016 inflation forecast as ‘balanced’, previously the risks were biased upside, is significant. In fact, the RBI said if the current inflation momentum and changes in inflationary expectations continue, a change in the monetary policy stance is likely early next year. Think this paves way for a rate cut in early 2015 unless global commodity prices aggressively reverse their fall. We like staying long Indian bonds here.
SANDEEP BAGLA, ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR, TRUST GROUP
The change in stance by RBI is very heartening. The easing of commodity prices has meant that the central bank has room to cut rate by around 75 bps for the next full year. Market has tried to price in this possibility by rallying strongly. There’s a good chance that the 10-year yield will fall to 7.90-7.95 in the immediate term.
R. SIVAKUMAR, HEAD OF FIXED INCOME, AXIS ASSET MANAGEMENT, MUMBAI
Clearly, a very dovish statement by the governor; they have acknowledged that inflation is treading expectations and that there is scope for monetary easing in early 2015. Markets like clarity and they are reading this as a signal that barring any surprises, a Feb 2015 rate cut looks likely.
BACKGROUND
- India’s annual infrastructure output growth accelerated to 6.3 percent in October, driven by pick up in coal and electricity generation, government data showed, indicating an improvement in economic activity.
- Gross domestic product expanded 5.3 percent in the July-September quarter from a year earlier as a manufacturing slump took the bounce out of Asia’s third-largest economy. Growth in the previous quarter was at a 2-1/2 year high of 5.7 percent.
- India has scrapped a rule mandating traders to export 20 percent of all gold imported into the country, a surprise move that could cut smuggling and raise legal shipments into the world’s second-biggest consumer of the metal after China.
- The Indian government plans to raise about 891.2 billion rupees ($14.4 billion) by reducing its stakes in state-run banks to 52 percent, the junior finance minister said.
- India could give banks more flexibility to restructure distressed loans in a bid to steer funding towards cash-strapped infrastructure projects, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Raghuram Rajan said.
- The wholesale price index rose an annual 1.77 percent last month, its slowest since September 2009, compared with the 2.20 percent forecast by economists in a Reuters poll.
- Retail inflation, which the RBI tracks in setting lending rates, slowed to 5.52 percent in October from a multi-year low of 6.46 percent a month earlier, helped by slower annual rises in food and fuel prices.
- India raised the minimum capital requirement for so-called shadow banks and tightened rules on deposits and bad loans to avoid any potential risk to the economy from these rapidly growing finance firms by regulating them like traditional banks.

RBI to Allow Banks More Flexibility in Debt Restructuring
Press Trust of India | Updated On: December 02, 2014 19:43 (IST)
Up to 7 No Production Days a Month Till March: Mahindra
Mumbai: Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan today said banks may be soon allowed to increase their equity holdings above the current cap of 10 per cent in companies undergoing debt restructuring.
The central bank is planning to unveil two measures to enable more productive loan restructuring, he said, adding that it is also mulling extending the 5/25 rule for fresh lending.
This rule enables a bank to extend loans to an infra developer for 25 years with an option to rewrite or reset the terms of the loan or transfer it to another bank or financial institution after five years. It ensures that tenure of the loan matches the life cycle of the underlying asset.
"In the next few days, I hope to announce two key relaxations. One is a move towards 5/25 restructuring for existing projects which are standard and also to allow banks to take equity in restructuring to a greater extent than they currently can," Dr Rajan said, addressing the media after announcing the bi-monthly policy wherein he left all the key policy rates unchanged.
"There is a substantial financial stress in some sectors. We have been taking a holistic view instead of a sector by sector approach keeping in mind the need for a financial restructuring while limiting the extent of forbearance," he said.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had in the Budget proposed that he would ease the financing structure for infrastructure projects by introducing the 5/25 rule which let banks to lend money to a developer for up to 25 years.
Bad loans and restructured loans together constitute more than 10.4 per cent of the banking system assets as of the September quarter, with some state-run banks like Central Bank having such assets over 20 per cent, while nearly half of them have it between 15 per cent and 19 per cent.
Last fiscal as much as 20 per cent of all infra loans were restructured. As that as of March 2014, infrastructure loans worth around over Rs 57,200 crore were under corporate debt restructuring. Dr Rajan explained that as part of a restructuring process, banks' holding in a company had been capped at 10 per cent through a notification issued in May 2013.
Meanwhile during the conference call with the analysts, RBI Deputy Governor SS Mundra, said: "In the whole restructuring process, if enterprise is viable and banks are putting a package and if they are taking a higher write-off or haircut in shape of debt, I think there is merit that they can in point of time converted into equity.
"It also has another advantage, that in such cases if there is a turnaround, then the upside is going to promoters alone but when the proportion is high, some of the upside can spill over to the bank."

Not aiming 4% CPI inflation by Jan 2016: RBI s Rajan06:00 pm
The Reserve Bank of India Tuesday held rates, crushing market and India Inc's hope of a rate cut. In an exclusive conversation with CNBC-TV18's Latha Venkatesh, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan said the central bank needs little more comfort on inflation before cutting rates.
The governor added that significant rate cut depends on the deflationary process. He is not uncomfortable with undershooting 6 percent inflation target and is not aiming for a 4 percent consumer price inflation by January 2016.
Below is verbatim transcript of his interview:
Q: I hope we will continue to get this chance to interview you as Governor of Reserve Bank. I hope you are not going away to the BRICS Bank?
A: No
Q: There were reports saying that your name was mentioned?
A: I have not heard anything about it.
Q: You have not been told, not asked?
A: This is a job that I am doing the only job I care about and I am happy here.
Q: You are happy here but it is quite possible that you may be requested to take on?
A: That is hypothetical question.
Q: No I am not indulging in hypothesis.
A: No, I have not been asked about it and I am very happy here.
Q: What is the sense you are getting about this 6 percent in March 2015 and the 6 percent in January 2016? Do you think you will achieve it more easily? Can you give say a chance of more downside surprise?
A: Every reading we have had on inflation since November of last year has been good and so that is suggesting that something is happening in this economy which is changing the environment. Now after five years of very high inflation we should not be faltered for trying to make sure that this is the real thing because we have had false alarms before.
In every additional inflation reading we seem to confirm the trend. Our policy was saying that we need a little more comfort but we want to do this in such a way that barring exceptional eventualities that we can’t foresee, when we change we change in a direction that is easy to anticipate and you would anticipate that further moves would be in the same direction.
Q: Do you suspect that given that you have got downside surprises, very pleasant ones over the last 12 months to the inflation reading, is there a decent chance that it will continue?
A: I am hopeful and what we want to do is see if that actually happens. However, all the macro economic surprises India has had over the last year, somebody is watching out for us, have been positive. So, let us hope the trend continues.
If you were mean reverting you would say we have had so many positive surprises now we should start seeing some negative surprises.
Q: What according to you should be the positive real rate of return because at 6 percent it is 2 percentage points, the positive real rate? Is that not enough for you if you see so much clarity up until next year? Do you want to remain at 2 percent or would you be comfortable with 1 percent?
A: The real rate that should prevail in economy depends on so many things including what is your comfort level with rate of growth, the kind of investment cycle that you are seeing. So, when the economy is weaker, the real rate that you would expect would be lower and as it strengthens you would want a higher real rate to prevail.
If you look at the world, what real rate is prevailing in other economies, it is in the 1.5-2 range for developed countries and for emerging markets a little higher. So, we don’t have a specific precise number in mind but the range would be somewhere between 1.5 and 2.5; that would be a perfectly acceptable real rate.
Q: If that is the acceptable real rate and your forecast is that inflation is going to be in and around 6 percent through calendar 2015 there isn’t so much scope for rates to fall at all?
A: You are making that judgment I am not going to verify or deny that judgment.
Q: The trend you spotted was yours?
A: Obviously, the scope for further rate cuts, of significant rate cuts depends on the pace of disinflationary process. Six is not a magic number that we hope to stick to. Overtime it has to go below six if the government formally approves the target of four plus minus two then we would be nudging closer to the four overtime number.
 
Now that timeframe over which we reach the four has still to be determined and so on. However, that would give you more room at that point to cut more. You are absolutely right there if there is a certain real rate that we need for savers in this economy that means a certain amount of room and that to get more room inflation has to fall further.
Q: In that case is it possible or is it very much in your thinking that this 6 percent 2016 target is a very transient target, you will find yourself bringing it down in the months to come?
A: It is important that when you set something you stick to it.
Q: Do you see it coming is what I mean.
A: We may undershoot the target and if we undershoot the target we are not going to feel uncomfortable about undershooting. If we expect to overshoot the target we will try and bring it in within the target but the time over which it is going to reach closer to the central point of the band is something that will have to be determined as we formalise.
So, what is the period over which we are going to look at meeting the inflation objective? It doesn’t mean that we have to be at 4 percent on January 2016. As I said in the policy announcement that if we get to 6 percent we are at the extremes of the target and if we do better that is fine but at this point we want to get to 6 percent.
Q: Why have you maintained it at six because a lot of your base assumptions were USD 100 for crude and the rupee at 60, global growth of a certain order some of them at least have changed? Haven’t you changed any of your assumptions you haven’t inputted them?
A: We have input them and remember it was the model was saying seven percent in our last policy meeting. Now the model is saying 6.2 but in the previous policy meeting we said our subjective assessment over and above the model is that probably we are over estimating the inflation and development since then have correspondent to our intuition that the model itself has come towards where we thought it would be. It is now closer to our comfort range in terms of where we think it will be.
Q: Are you getting a sense that these factors be it rural wages or government management of stocks or for that matter global commodity prices, global corn, wheat food prices will sustain through next year? Do any of these looks secular to you?
A: I don’t think global prices are going to take off that rapidly unless there is concerted failure of the climate issues across the world as I think was the case in 2007 and 2008.
However, apart from that world food price provides that ceiling beyond which domestic food prices can not move much. So, that is going to be one good thing.
Food management hopefully is a secular positive that we improve it as time goes on and as a result we move food to where the prices are high.
Farmers make proper choices between what to produce so as to bring down prices in longer run. So, these are steady trends and hopefully, we will not be the only large country in the world experiencing double digit inflation. Right now we look like we have escaped that well and truly.

Omega Healthcare is looking to double its revenue in three years from $55 million.
The firm, which offers revenue cycle management for healthcare providers in the U.S., sees huge potential at the backdrop of Obama Care as well as industry shift in coding systems from the so-called ICD-9 to ICD-10.
The International Classification of Disease tenth revision (ICD-10) is a system of coding created by the World Health Organization that notes various medical records, including diseases, symptoms, abnormal findings and external causes of injury.
“We have 2,000 medical coders and 50 per cent of the coders are trained in ICD-10. With the U.S. shift, the business is going to explode and the by end of next year our coding business should grow by over 50 per cent,” Omega Healthcare Co-Founder and CEO Gopi Natarajan said.
He said the firm would close with overall revenue of $55 million, and was looking to double it in the next three years. Omega has grown at a compounded annual growth rate of 30-32 per cent in the last five years. “There is a lot of opportunity with the changes in the U.S. healthcare system and acceptance towards out sourcing is more now than ever before,” said Mr. Natarajan.
Omega is also looking to double its head count in three years from 6,700 employees now.

Srinivasan dragging names of former crickets to cover up: Aditya VermaBy: Press Trust of India | New Delhi |
Posted: December 2, 2014 8:55 pm | Updated: December 2, 2014 9:07 pm
The secretary of the Cricket Association of Bihar (CAB), Aditya Verma today alleged that sidelined BCCI president N. Srinivasan’s counsel has been dragging the names of top cricketers in the Supreme Court to cover up for his own “conflict of interest” in the board.
“I was shocked to watch how Srinivasan, through his counsels, told the honourable Supreme Court a bunch of lies on Monday to protect his own interest,” Verma said.
“Srinivasan informed the court that players like Sunil Gavaskar, Sourav Ganguly, Brijesh Patel, Anil Kumble, Ravi Shastri, Lalchand Rajput, Venkatesh Prasad and Krishnamachari Srikanth were also involved in conflict of interest in the cricket board.
“With deep regret I must say that Srinivasan is consciously tarnishing the image of some cricketing idols only to save himself.
“The point is that none of these cricketers had ever remained an office bearer in the BCCI and did not profit from those offices. So, they can never be compared with Srinivasan. At the most, they were sub-committee members. In fact, when Gavaskar was made the BCCI interim president to look after the IPL, he was asked by the honourable Supreme Court to relieve himself of all duties as a television commentator,” said Verma.
Verma said there were a couple of exceptions like K Srikanth and L Sivaramakrishnan. “Srikanth was widely criticized for being a Chennai Super Kings (CSK) official despite being the chairman of the national selection committee.
“Worse is Sivaramakrishnan – a commentator, an ICC sub-committee member and an India Cement employee, thanks to the blessing of one person,” Verma said.

Virender Sehwag hopeful of being in 2015 World Cup probables listBy: Press Trust of India |
Posted: December 2, 2014 7:19 pm
It’s been close to two years that he has been out of national team but veteran opener Virender Sehwag is hopeful that selectors would consider him in the 30-members probables list for the next year’s cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.
Despite not exactly setting the domestic stage on fire, the 36-year-old still harbours dreams of playing a fourth World Cup for his country.
“I also hope that my name appears in the 30-member strong probables list. Every cricketer who plays wants to play in the World Cup for his country. I also still dream and hope even I play in this World Cup,” Sehwag, who has played the 2003, 2007 and 2011 editions of the event, said.
On India’s chances in the competition, Sehwag seemed confident that Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s men will retain the Cup.
“We won the trophy in 2011. I think we have the capability to retain it in 2015. We have a good team. They are playing good cricket in the ODI format. I believe that we can defend it,” the out-of-favour opener said at a promotional event related to ICC World Cup.
Sehwag feels that since Indian team will be there in Australia for the Test as well as tri-series, there won’t be any problems adjusting to the conditions.
“I think all the players, who will go to the World Cup, they would have already played Tests and triangular series before the start of the World Cup. So they will get used to the conditions,” Sehwag said.
The swashbuckling batsman feels that it’s good that the World Cup is being held in Australia as it’s the best place to play cricket.
“Australia is the best place to play cricket. You get good fast pitches with bounce, and the ball comes nicely on to the bat. You will enjoy batting as well as bowling in these conditions.
Asked if the teams would have to adjust a lot in Australia and New Zealand, he said,”The wickets are similar, they are not different. In World Cup, you will get good wickets to bat and bowl on. You will get true wickets for the game. I don’t think there will be any problem for any team or any problem to adjust.

Cabinet approves bill to replace coal mining ordinance
The bill to replace the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Ordinance, 2014 is likely to be brought before the Parliament during the ongoing winter session.

The government Tuesday cleared a Bill on coal block auctions to replace an ordinance that was promulgated to begin auction of coal mines that were cancelled by the Supreme Court.
The bill to replace the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Ordinance, 2014 is likely to be brought before the Parliament during the ongoing winter session.
"Cabinet has approved the bill," a source said after the Cabinet meeting here. The Supreme Court had in September cancelled allocation of 204 coal blocks, including 42 operational mines and another 32 ready-to-start blocks.
Government through the ordinance started the process of auctioning at least 74 operational or ready-to-operate blocks with the target of allocating them by March, well before the deadline set by Supreme Court for companies operating the mines to wind up operations.
The ordinance has been opposed by the central trade unions, including BJP-affiliated trade union Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS). BMS as also AITUC, CITU, HMS and INTUC have jointly opposed the government's proposal to allow private players to mine coal and sell it in the open market, a right till now reserved with the state-owned Coal India Limited.
The ordinance has also come under attack from Left parties. Meanwhile government has already said that the 74 coal mines, which government plans to auction to specific end-users in the first phase of bidding on February 11, will not require any green clearances.
The auction will be for the private sector, while state-owned companies will get mines via allotment. The government had last week announced auctioning and allotment of 74 blocks in the first phase of bidding. These blocks have a potential to produce 210 million tonnes of coal.
Government had already made it clear that the number of mines a company can bid will be capped to avoid monopoly.

People are the ultimate judges: KCRAn exclusive interview with Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao
How do you rate your government’s performance in the last six months?
I spent four months in planning various projects. My opponents might be critical, but I have a plan for everything. People would ultimately judge whether the Government is efficient or not. I have to be realistic and sincere. People will realise this when they see results shortly.
What plans do you have for improving the power situation?
We are now getting around 4,200 MW of power from various sources. The situation will ease by the end of 2015 positively. AP is poised to generate some 3,240 MW from Krishnapatnam, Hinduja and RTPP-3 projects and Telangana will get a share of 56 per cent in that. Similarly, Telangana will add some 1,800 MW in which AP will get 46 per cent share.
If everything goes as per the AP Reorganisation Act, we will get some 2, 720 MW from AP. Assuming that AP will not part with the Telagnana share, we will stop giving power to AP from Telangana stations. That means, Telangana will have 1,800 MW plus another 4,00 MW from Central Generation Stations and 300 MW from solar stations. That’s 2,500 MW of power available by the end of 2015. That will see us through 2015. Later, by 2016 power from Chhattisgarh would also be available and our plans for adding another 4,000 MW would also fructify as BHEL would supply the equipment we ordered.
That’s the time we become power sufficient.
What is the position of the mega scheme - water grid?
The survey itself costs some Rs 105 crore. The motors and pumps have to be custom-built and all these works would have to be taken up only during the non-rainy season.
You promised to develop Karimnagar and Hyderabad like New York and London? Is anything happening?
We sanctioned ring roads around all district headquarters. Master plans are being prepared. It’s not just a hollow promise. It will be done. We are emphasising on maintaining quality of our works. For example, bitumen imported from Dubai can be used for roads, but it lasts only six months.
HPCL bitumen also lasts for six months so we are getting it from HPCL.
People have apprehensions that they would not get pension cards?
There is no need for this. We are giving more cards and more money too. We have raised the income limit eligibility and that means more people will be covered. All these cards will be given by December 15 and I can promise that New Year will be happy for all.
What plans for Hyderabad?
We have decided to give pattas free of cost to all those who are having 100 yards of land. This will be a major programme and only after giving the ownership, we will take up the slum-free Hyderabad programme.
My policy is to have clarity on programmes. “Don’t confuse and don’t get confused. Be realistic and sincere, people will realise this”.

Uddhav Thackeray s Shiv Sena to get 12 ministries in Maharashtra BJP govtPeshawar school attack: Pakistani pupils recall narrow escapes, carnage in Taliban slaughter
A day after Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) govt in Maharashtra led by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said the talks with Uddhav Thackeray’s Shiv Sena over power sharing were 70-80 per cent complete, a senior Sena leader today said both the parties have “buried” their differences and agreed on a “suitable” formula.
According to the pact, Sena will be allotted a total of 12 ministries in the Fadnavis government, out of which 5 will be of Cabinet rank.
However, the formal announcement in this regard is likely to be delayed in the wake of demise of Congress veteran and former Maharashtra chief minister A R Antulay today.
“After discussing our alliance with the BJP over last few days, we have finally decided on a ministry-sharing formula (which is) agreeable to both parties,” said a senior Sena leader whose name is reportedly in reckoning among Sena inductees in BJP government.
“We have decided (with BJP) that Shiv Sena will hold 5 cabinet portfolios in the state ministry and 7 Minister of State portfolios,” he said.
He said the expansion of the state cabinet, slated for Wednesday, may get deferred by a couple of days after Antulay’s death.
“We have to follow the protocol after the sad demise of Congress leader A R Antulay. The expansion will be deferred by at least a couple of days now, and thus we will be formally announcing the names of Sena ministers only when the cabinet expansion date is announced,” he said.
Another Sena leader said ministries to be allotted to his party include Industries, Environment, Health, MSRDC (Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation) and Transport or Excise.
This is viewed as a tactical climb-down by Sena from its earlier stand wherein it had staked the claim for the crucial posts of the deputy chief minister and home minister.
However, senior Sena leader Subhash Desai who had held talks with Fadnavis last night told PTI that talks between BJP and Sena leaders will continue today.
“We discussed several things last night,” he has said.
A Sena leader had said last night that talks with BJP have almost reached a positive conclusion barring one ministry.
When contacted a senior BJP leader said the formula – allotting 5 Cabinet berths and 7 state ministries to Sena – is indeed thrashed out.
“However discussions are still on,” he said on condition of anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to media.

Narendra Modi hits out at media over pre-set agenda during interviewsPeshawar school attack: Pakistani pupils recall narrow escapes, carnage in Taliban slaughter
Prime Minister Narendra Modi was today critical of the media as he charged it with having a pre-set agenda in mind while asking questions saying the interviewer often leads the person interviewed to give an answer he wants.
“In interviews, this is our experience. We have to reply at every roundabout and nook and corner. In most of the interviews, the person asking questions has already decided on the answers. He will not let you go unless you give him the answer he wants. Once you have given the answer they want, they lose interest in you,” he said.
Modi was addressing a gathering to mark 21 years of popular TV show ‘Aap ki Adalat’ hosted by senior journalist Rajat Sharma on India TV. President Pranab Mukherjee was also present on the occasion.
Appreciating the show, he said this is one place where the “accused” is not led into answering something pre-decided.
“It is not required to force people to answer the way you want,” he said.
President Mukherjee also lauded the show saying 125 crore Indians have appointed Sharma as their “public prosecutor”. “Please do not change your role,” he said.
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) President Amit Shah, Union ministers Arun Jaitley, Venkaiah Naidu and Smriti Irani were among those present. Former Union ministers Kamal Nath, Sushilkumar Shinde and Salman Khurshid were also there and joined by bigwigs from all walks of life including Bollywood famous Khan troika Aamir, Salman and Shah Rukh.

Sadhvi stokes controversy with  abusive  remarksPeshawar school attack: Pakistani pupils recall narrow escapes, carnage in Taliban slaughter
Union Minister Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti has stoked a controversy by allegedly making communal remarks and using an expletive in an election rally here, leaving the BJP and the government embarrassed as an angry Opposition demanded that she be sacked.
The remarks that voters of Delhi should choose between “Ram’s sons” and “illegitimate sons” drew the ire of Opposition which protested in Parliament following which Jyoti expressed “deep regret” and apologised for her actions and said she did not intend to hurt anyone’s feelings.
The issue rocked both the Houses as agitated opposition MPs disrupted proceedings, seeking an explanation from the Prime Minister and demanding an apology from Jyoti, who is Minister of state for food processing industries and had joined the Narendra Modi Ministry early last month.
“The Prime Minister should give an explanation,” Congress leader Anand Sharma said.
BSP chief Mayawati said the minister’s remarks were against the secular ethos espoused by the Constitution and do not behold a person occupying a constitutional post.
The BJP should sack her, she said.
She and CPI(M) MP Sitaram Yechury demanded that an FIR be filed against Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti.
The Congress alleged that Jyoti had insulted the people of Delhi and she should issue an apology while the Aam Aadmi Party said it was the BJP’s real face.
“The divisive thinking and divisive politics of the BJP has been exposed,” Congress leader Ambika Soni said.
Niranjan was initially defiant saying she was only referring to the “anti-nationals” in her speech made in west Delhi yesterday.
“I was referring to the anti-nationals, those who compromise with its borders, its integrity. What else do you call people who loot the nation…? What should we call them? Why is it being objected to,” she said when questioned on the use of expletives.
Later, outside Parliament, the Minister was asked about demands for her resignation. “I have apologised and I have nothing else to say,” she replied.
BJP spokesman Sambit Patra said it was a “slip of tongue” and the issue should not be politicised.
Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said those in the government and the opposition should use dignified langugage and in the past UPA ministers too had crossed the line many times.
Manish Sisodia of Aam Aadmi Party said, “This is the real character of BJP. Their language shows what kind of work they are doing at the Centre and what kind of work they will do for Delhi.”
The BJP said the issue should not be stretched after the Minister has tendered an apology. It also hit out at Congress, saying several of its leaders had made objectionable remarks in the past.
“But have they ever been asked to resign. When did Congress sack them from the party. And they are called experienced leaders while Sadhvi Niranjan has become MP for the first time,” UP BJP chief Laxmikant Bajpai said.
Jyoti has been elected from Fatehpur Lok Sabha constituency in Uttar Pradesh.
“My intention was not to hurt anyone. If my speech outside the House has hurt anyone, I express my deep regrets and accept…,” Jyoti said in Lok Sabha.
In Rajya Sabha, she said, “If certain words spoken by me outside the House have hurt someone, I take back my words and offer regrets. However, if the House feels so, I am also ready to seek an apology.”
Members of Congress, TMC, SP and other opposition parties rushed to the Well during the uproar over her remarks leading to four adjournments in Rajya Sabha and one in Lok Sabha during pre-lunch sitting.
Jyoti had earlier defended her remarks while speaking to the media and even commented that all the people in the country are “offsprings of Ram”.
“Those who have sold the country, made it bankrupt, people will not voter for such people. Taking Ram’s name, talking about Ram, is it communalism?
“Muslims offer namaz in mosques, we do no object. Christians pray in churches, we do not object. Then talking about Ram should not be termed as communal. And those who call me communal, I would say what could be more communal than this,” she said.
“Do you want a government of people who believe in Ram, a government that believes in people. And I would like to say one more thing, be it Hindu or a Christian in the country, he is an offspring of Ram. And those who refuse to believe this, will never believe in this country also,” she said.
Members from Opposition parties like Ram Gopal Yadav (SP), D Raja (CPI) and Sharad Yadav (JD-U) too said that the Minister’s remarks were “unconstitutional” and demanded that she should be sacked from the Council of Ministers.
However, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu rejected the demand saying the matter has ended after the minister realised her mistake and apologised.
“She has realised her mistake and acknowledged it, so the matter ends there…. She told me that she never intended it, so I counselled her. What is wrong with it. As the Parliamentary Affairs Minister, it is my duty to coordinate among the ministers, opposition…,” he told reporters.
“She is a woman from an economically weaker background who has risen without all sorts of support,” he said, adding many Congress leaders have used objectionable words in the past and never even apologised.
At the rally yesterday, Jyoti had targeted Congress president Sonia Gandhi and her son-in-law Robert Vadra.

Will file defamation case against BJP: KejriwalPeshawar school attack: Pakistani pupils recall narrow escapes, carnage in Taliban slaughter
Former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal today said his party will file a criminal defamation case against BJP which has alleged that AAP was diverting funds from NGOs of its leaders.
Kejriwal also challenged the BJP to disclose the list of their donors as his party has done and accused the saffron party of “terrorising” those who have donated money to AAP.
He also took a jibe at the media for “arbitrary coverage” of the allegations levelled by the BJP.
“Media has widely covered arbitrary and baseless allegations by BJP against our funding. We are filing criminal defamation against BJP.”
“I have been challenging BJP and Congress to disclose their list of donors (the way we do). Would media give similar coverage to us? For the first time, a political party (is) trying transparent funding n disclosing its list of donors. BJP trying to terrorise our donors. Fair?” the AAP chief posted on Twitter.
AAP had organised lunch for traders, with an entry fee of Rs 20,000. The party collected a whopping sum of Rs 50 lakh.
In a similar event held in Mumbai last Thursday, the party had fetched Rs 91 lakh, taking the total to Rs 1.41 crore in just two such events.
Accusing AAP of diverting funds from NGOs of its leaders, Delhi BJP had yesterday called for a probe into such events.

Now you can rent an adorable hobbits house  which almost makes up for the fact that you have to live in L.A.Here’s the listing, via Pacific Shore Property Management :
Located in prime & hip Downtown Culver City, Here is a rare opportunity to live inside a Storybook cottage straight out of a Fairytale. Known as “The Hobbit’s House”, this unique property was created by Disney artist Joseph Lawrence who spent 24 years creating between 1946 and 1970. This cottage features rustic stone hewn walls, leaded glass windows, and magical looking ponds filled with fish and a family of turtles. The main house features 2 bedrooms and 1 bath, plus a huge bonus room that could be an office or den. The living room that is situated around an original stone fireplace features stained glass windows, nautical details and a bar that is perfect for entertaining. The quaint kitchen comes with a mini-fridge that is built in. 2 bedrooms sit behind a wooden plank door and offer great sunlight, and a view of the fountain and pond at the front of the house.

A “truly enchanting” cottage, designed by a Disney artist! Great sunlight! A pond. And minutes from the Kirk Douglas Theater! Available now for $2,595 a month !
A hobbit’s house, as it turns out, is sort of an L.A. thing, like really good tacos and complaining about traffic on the freeway. Storybook-style houses are a “whimsical type of architecture that emerged in Los Angeles with the burgeoning movie industry in the 1920s,” according to a 2005 L.A. Times story .
“Storybook houses are an outgrowth of the blurred line of fantasy and reality that is particular to Los Angeles,” Trudi Sandmeier, a preservationist at the Los Angeles Conservancy, told the Times. She noted that you can find the homes elsewhere, but they were especially popular in California.
On its Web site, the L.A. Conservancy calls the property on Dunn Drive “one of the most significant examples of Storybook architecture in Los Angeles.”
“The sweeping shingled roofs, diamond-paned windows, and clinker-brick chimneys exemplify the fanciful Storybook style, which took inspiration from idealized interpretations of European cottages,” the conservancy’s site reads. And before you even ask — I know what you’re thinking.
There is parking. This is L.A., after all.

United Bank of India Identifies UB Holding as Wilful Defaulter
Press Trust of India | Updated On: December 03, 2014 00:16 (IST)
New Delhi: In fresh trouble for liquor baron Vijay Mallya, United Bank of India has identified United Breweries Holdings, the guarantor of grounded airline Kingfisher, as wilful defaulter.
The bank has already declared Kingfisher Airlines and its four directors including Mr Mallya as wilful defaulters.
"We have identified United Breweries (UB) Holdings as wilful defaulter because company had the resources to repay the loan as guarantor of Kingfisher Airlines," United Bank of India executive director Deepak Narang told PTI.
UB Holdings had additional resources available as per the balance sheet of 2013-14, he said, adding that these funds could have been used for paying loans given to Kingfisher.
The bank issued notice to the UB Holdings and got a reply which was not satisfactory.
"We would take further action after due deliberations on the issue," he added.
In September this year, UBI became the first lender to declare debt-ridden Kingfisher Airlines, its promoter Vijay Mallya and other directors wilful defaulters as the company allegedly indulged in diversion of funds by opening multiple accounts.
The other directors declared as wilful defaulters by the Grievance Redressal Committee (GRC) of the bank are Ravi Nedungadi, Anil Kumar Ganguly and Subash Gupte. Kingfisher Airlines and directors declared as wilful defaulters now won't be able to borrow from banks in the future. They would also lose director-level positions in companies and criminal proceeding could be initiated against them, if warranted, to recover the money.
The bank had first given notice to declare Kingfisher Airlines as wilful defaulter on May 28. However, the company approached Calcutta High Court against the notice.
A single bench dismissed the company's plea. Subsequently, it approached double bench which upheld the single bench order on August 28.
UBI's exposure to Kingfisher Airlines was around Rs 350 crore as part of consortium led by State Bank of India. The consortium of 17 banks has an outstanding debt of about Rs 6,521 crore from the now-grounded carrier. Outside the consortium, UBI gave about Rs 60 crore loan for pre-delivery payment.

Why we love Sushmita SenWhy we love Sushmita Sen
Bollywoodshaadis.com –  Tue 2 Dec, 2014 6:40 PM IST
Share 0
 
One of the most beautiful women in the universe, Sushmita Sen, is someone who has always broken away from the conformists' mould and tried to do something different. She is an independent woman, who does not shy away from expressing her views on anything and everything. And yes, this gorgeous mother is blissfully single! Sushmita Sen found her happily-ever-after not with any man, but with her two wonderful daughters.
The diva just turned 39 today, and has been leading a life that is tremendously inspiring. Here are the four timeless lessons that Sushmita Sen has taught us through her actions.
#1. Being a single and happy parent
You do not need to be married to feel the joys of being a mother, and this is something that Sushmita truly believes in. In 2000, when Sushmita was 25 years-old and was winning awards and praises for her supporting role in Biwi No. 1, the world was her oyster. Yet she did something that no other Indian actress would dare to do; she adopted a baby girl named Renée. Sushmita chose to take over the responsibilities of motherhood, along with her acting career.

Ten years later, Sushmita repeated the history by adopting a second girl child. When the court granted her the custody, she came out with a charming smile and said, “I am feeling on top of the world. I have named her Alisah, which in Greek means joyful. She is a very happy child. She will win you over in one minute.”
Sush’s Mantra: Love your child unconditionally. As a mother it should never matter to you if your child comes out of your womb or your heart.

#2. Become a complete powerhouse
Single parents have to deal with many tough questions. The most common one, "where is my daddy/mummy?" Sushmita too faced her fair share of such questions from her kids. One day when Renée came back from school, she asked about her father. Sushmita just smiled and pointed to a Shivling (a representation of Lord Shiva) and told her that was her father.
The way she has handled all their questions has ensured that her children clearly understood the responsibilities of a single parent and also respected that. Now, Renée knows that her mother will choose a father for them someday, but not without her daughters' approval.
Sush’s Mantra: Being a single parent can be really tough, but it is not impossible. Best way to handle your kid’s innocent questions is to be truthful to them and you will definitely earn their respect.
While Sushmita did not feel the need of being a parent biologically, these celebrities did the other way round. Have a look at these  Bollywood Celebrities Who Did Not Conceive Naturally .
#3. Learn to pamper yourself
When Sushmita was seen sporting a solitaire on her ring finger, the rumour mills started speculating about a possible engagement. But Sushmita clarified that she had bought the 22-carat solitaire for herself. Sushmita said, “I don't need a man in my life to have diamonds. I can own them myself.”
Sush’s Mantra: Be independent, be proud and never hesitate to pamper yourself.
Although it might be tough to be a single mother, but it is a wonderful feeling at the same time. Here is  How to Overcome the Challenges of Being a Single Mother
#4. Nothing wrong in waiting for Mr. Right!
Many single women often jump into marriage once they cross their 20s. Some fear the idea of remaining single for life while others fear social pressure. And at times, all these crazy thoughts get many women trapped into the institution of marriage without them being sure about it. However, Sushmita believes, “It (marriage) is a celebration of choice.” She even said, "I don't think I should walk with the system. Our society has made this system that get graduate at 18, by 22 start panicking to get married and by 27 have your first child. I don't believe in that..." "Every person's DNA is different. I will certainly get married and for sure it's going to be a beautiful wedding (Masha allah bahut khoobsurat hogi meri shaadi)." So, it is perfectly fine to wait for the Mr. Right, rather than just getting settled due to the social pressure.

Chinese are not unbeatable: P. V. Sindhubadminton
The 19-year-old shuttler P.V. Sindhu, who retained the Macau Grand Prix Gold women’s singles title last week-end, feels that for many of the players from outside China, there is some sort of a comfort zone now when playing the formidable Chinese players.
“Yes, even as the women’s singles competition continues to be tough, it is a fact that the Chinese players are no more unbeatable. I must say players like the Japanese Akane Yamaguchi and Nozomi Okuhara are really playing well and are potential champions,” says Sindhu in an interaction at the Gopi Chand Badminton Academy on Tuesday.
“The best example is the way Saina and Srikanth have won the titles in the recent China Open,” she added.
“Why? May be, the training methods and the intensity in preparations have changed for the good. For instance, Gopi Sir is so well-equipped with all sorts of information and strategies that he ensures that there is a feel-good thing about the prospect of facing these Chinese players. They are always dangerous opponents but the chances of beating them have certainly increased,” said Sindhu.
No regrets
“I have no regrets when I look back at the year 2014. It was a very satisfying one having won the bronze each in the World Championship, the Commonwealth Games and a historic one in the Uber Cup women’s team event,” said Sindhu.
“It all boils down to how well you play consistently. This is one area where I will be focusing more as I prepare for the next year which starts off with the Syed Modi Grand Prix. You can’t play the same way in every match.
“Sometimes you win from losing situations as it happened to me in the pre-quarterfinal of the Macau event and sometimes you lose from winning positions. Definitely, I will be keen to increase the rate of winning henceforth,” added Sindhu, who has just a day’s break before flying to Bengaluru for the PSPB Championship.
“Realistically, the first target is to break into the top 10 and stay in the elite group with improved performances. Yes, there are quite a few areas to work on and I am sure Gopi Sir will be guiding me to be a much better player next time around,” Sindhu said.
The champion shuttler reiterated that she was glad that she could end the season with a title-triumph.
“It would have been disappointing if I had not won the Macau title even though the whole year has been highly satisfying for me. I am aware that it is important to keep winning big titles,” she concluded.

Anil Kumar Sinha appointed new CBI directorAnil Kumar Sinha appointed new CBI director

CBI special director Anil Kumar Sinha was appointed CBI director late on Tuesday night, the first agency director to be appointed with bipartisan support. He has been appointed for two years.
Anil Sinha has been chosen as CBI director to succeed outgoing chief Ranjit Sinha after a meeting in Delhi.
The Bihar cadre IPS officer’s appointment came within hours of a meeting of a panel comprising Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge and the CJI. The committee had short-listed the names of two 1979 batch police officers, Sinha and National Investigation Agency chief Sharad Kumar, to lead the premier agency.
Modi later picked Sinha’s name and ordered his appointment. PK Mishra, additional principal secretary to the PM, confirmed Sinha’s appointment to HT.
As reported by HT on Tuesday, the government had discovered at the last minute that the high-powered panel did not really have the power to select the next director. Instead, it could only recommend a panel of officers.
This provision complicated the selection process, leading to procedural delays in Sinha’s appointment orders issued late Tuesday.
Government sources said Sinha was the natural choice, given his wide experience in fighting corruption. Other police officers in the running included 1977-batch Prakash Mishra, special secretary at the home ministry, and the police chiefs of Rajasthan and Maharashtra, Omendra Bhardwaj and Sanjeev Dayal, respectively.
Anil Kumar Sinha will succeed Ranjit Sinha, who had a tumultuous tenure of two years at the helm of affairs in CBI. Ranjit Sinha retired on Tuesday in the glare of a recent controversy with Supreme Court directing him to recuse from 2G scam probe a fortnight ago.

Incredible yet true: 3 of a family land a DDA flat eachComments
The Delhi Development Authority’s (DDA) housing draw is the biggest gamble of the Capital but a family from Himachal Pradesh had such a run of luck that three of its members landed a flat each.
The process through which DDA holds the draw of lots for allotting flats is completely computerized and rather long drawn. Despite all the measures taken to make the draw as random as possible, incredibly four consecutive application numbers have got a flat each out of which three are from the same family.
All of them have got one-bedroom flats, three in Narela and one in Siraspur.
The application numbers in question are 1145320, 1145321, 1145322 and 1145323, the last three of which belong to members of the same family. The DDA said there is no foul play in the draw.
The DDA spokesperson said all these applications came under the reserved category and while the odds for general category applicants was 1 to 40, for that of reserved category it was 1 to 6.
“The application numbers are fed to the computer and are randomized. A fresh randomized number is allotted to every application,” said the spokesperson. She said while the application numbers are consecutive, the randomized numbers fed in the system were 759776, 613457 and 507478, which are quite far apart.
“The chosen seed number by the judges is from the randomized lists and it is from the seed number onwards that the computer picks up the allotment numbers for allotting the flat,” she said.“As per the computerized draw even consecutive numbers can get flats and it all depends on their position in the randomized list from the seed number and also their preferences for locality and availability of flats in the particular locality,” she said. She said the allottees are in no way connected with DDA.

Boots made for walkin : 19% climb in ShoeSHARE ON WHATSAPP
EMAIL
Shoe Carnival SCVL  climbed $3.75 to $23.37 Tuesday, a 19% gain, after reporting better-than-expected third quarter results led by boot sales.
The Evansville, IN., based chain bucked an overall lackluster quarter for most retailers, reporting  sales up 8% to $254.7 million, Net income was flat at $10.8 million, or 54 cents a share.
“These results reflect strong sales in our fashion boot category and progress in key initiatives we announced last year, mainly, national advertising, better brands in our women’s department and a reinvigorated e-commerce presence, ” said CEO Cliff Sifford.
In a conference call with stock analysts, Sifford said boot sales – which include all non-work boots – were up 20% to 30% over 2013.
“We’ve seen the boot business get better and better as we’ve progressed in the second half of the year,” Sifford said.
Shoe Carnival raised fourth-quarter and full year guidance, with  sales projected up 3% to 5% and earnings per share up six to 10 cents vs. 3 cents in the year-ago quarter, but warned that discount holiday promotions designed to compete with rivals could cut into earnings.
The company, which operates 404 stores in 33 states and Puerto Rico, has been targeting more affluent shoppers and expanding into new markets.  Up to 25 stores will open in 2015.

5 once-popular cars killed off with 'final editions'

Automakers are giving the final edition treatment to a number of car models, starting with the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution. It's final edition comes next summer. Here's an Evo 6 near Manama, Bahrain, in this 2004 file photo,

LOS ANGELES -- Mitsubishi's Lancer Evolution remains one of the hottest-performing small cars on the market, but its heat hasn't extended to sales lately.
Mitsubishi officials said last week at the Los Angeles Auto Show that they're going to kill off the little Evo after the 2015 model year. But don't fret if you want one. It's one of the models from various makers celebrating their final years with long goodbyes designed to squeeze  a few more sales from nostalgic advocates.
They are usually classed as  "final editions."
Whether it's Volkswagen saying "adios" to the Eos hardtop convertible or Mercedes-Benz offering a "so long" to the AMG SLS brute, automakers are embracing a get-'em-before-they're-gone philosophy.
It's up to buyers to decide whether a model is, indeed, going away.
Mercedes turned right and created a new near-supercar, the Mercedes-AMG GT, to fill the void being left by the AMG SLS. Mazda sold out of 25th anniversary MX-5 Miatas earlier this year, but now has shown a shapely next-generation MX-5 Miata.
But often automakers just kill vehicle names outright and create for these a last, very public bow. Models on their last legs:
•Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution. The Evo will bow out next summer after a "special action model" is offered as a swan song. "It's a great 'halo" for for the brand, says  Don Swearingen, Mitsubishi's executive vice president in the U.S., of the Evo. "but at the end of the day, we only sell about 200 a month." Mitsu will move instead to hot-performing plug-in cars.
•Volkswagen Eos. The slope-backed steel droptop was a design marvel when it was introduced, but it has lagged on its high price. To make the Final Edition a "going out of business" deal at $39,985 including destination charges, VW has pounded on extras such as 18-inch allow wheels, backup camera and heated 12-way power seats.
"The decision to name the Eos 'Final Edition' was based on a desire to recognize the model for its unique content while celebrating the value it has brought to the VW lineup over the years," says spokesman Darryll Harrison. The naming protocol "has become a little bit of a tradition with some of our models."
•Mercedes-Benz AMG SLS. The supercar with nostalgic upward-opening "gullwing" doors became a favorite of car magazines as soon as it went on sale in 2010 because of its blistering performance and heritage.
The "Final Edition" made its debut at the auto shows last year, and the final run is limited to 350 units globally. A few remain "but are basically sold out," says Mercedes spokesman Christian Bokich.
As high-impact supercars go, though, it's being looked upon as a success. "The SLS definitely has a key place in automotive history and has gracefully exited the marketplace," he says.
•Toyota FJ Cruiser. Toyota says it built 2,500 of what it called the Trail Teams Ultimate Edition Cruiser as a swan song for the distinctive off-road vehicle.
The final FJ "pays tribute to the iconic Land Cruiser FJ40 of the 1960s, from which the FJ Cruiser draws its rugged DNA, inspiration and design," Toyota says.
"We created the Ultimate Edition to give the FJ a proper send off," says Sam Butto, a Toyota spokesman.
•Cadillac CTS-V Coupe. Cadillac said it would build 500 "limited edition" CTS-V performance cars based on the last-generation CTS for a 2015 model year even though a new V-Series is on its way for 2016.
Cadillac says the outgoing model is a way of celebrating the characteristics that defined the 2010 to 2014 models -- a 556-horsepower supercharged V-8 engine, Brembo brakes and magnetic-ride control.
But it is only a "stepping stone" to the next generation, Cadillac says.

Asian Shares Steady, Oil Rises as Crude Inventories Decline
Reuters | Updated On: December 03, 2014 07:32 (IST)
Oil Slumps Near $59 for First Time Since 2009 on Oversupply
Tokyo: Asian shares and the dollar got off to a steady start on Wednesday, while oil prices recovered after data showed a drop in US supply.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat, while Japan's Nikkei stock average added 0.6 per cent in early trade, after marking a seven-year closing high on Tuesday.
Wall Street posted solid gains on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing at a record high, boosted by gains in energy shares as investors searched for bargains in the sector.
US crude was up more than 1 per cent to $67.76 a barrel in early Asian trading, after industry group American Petroleum Institute (API) released data showing US crude stocks fell 6.5 million barrels last week.
In recently volatile trade amid massive oversupply, US crude tumbled on Tuesday after rising 4 per cent on Monday, its biggest gain since August 2012.
Saudi Arabia would only consider cutting production if other countries, including non-OPEC producer Russia, joined in limits, former Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki bin Faisal said on Tuesday.
While economists fear the sharp drop in global energy prices could fan deflationary pressures in some countries, both New York Fed President William Dudley and Vice Chair Stanley Fischer this week both painted a mostly rosy outlook for the U.S. economy and welcomed the cheaper oil.
"Both were relatively optimistic on the US economy and went out of their way to stress upside benefits to US economy of weaker oil prices," Steven Englander, global head of G10 foreign exchange strategy at CitiFX, said in a note.
"All of this is extremely positive for USD, given that fed funds has priced in an extremely flat policy hike path and the USD looks extremely sensitive to interest rate differentials in the current environment," he added.
Rising Treasury yields added to the appeal of the US dollar on Wednesday. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield ticked up to 2.292 per cent in Asian trade, up from its US close of 2.285 per cent.
The greenback was steady at 119.23 yen, not far from its Tuesday high of 119.29, That was its strongest level since August 2007, when it rose as high as 119.84.
The euro was flat on the day at $1.2385.
The dollar's recent strength has weighed on spot gold which dipped 0.2 per cent to $1,196.30 an ounce on Wednesday.

SRK  Salman Khan  Aamir Khan on stage together!Written by Sonal Gera , Edited by Sarika Sharma | New Delhi |
Posted: December 3, 2014 8:39 am | Updated: December 3, 2014 2:05 pm
The tune of the Khan reunion which started at Salman Khan’s sister Arpita’s wedding seems to have reached its climax on the sets of Rajat Sharma’s show ‘Aap Ki Adalat’. And just like the climax of Hindi movies, this one too had its “happy ending”.
It was the occasion of the completion of 21 years of the show ‘Aap Ki Adalat’ and hence, the shoot of this special episode, which took place last night (December 2) at Pragati Maidan, New Delhi, was attended by the who’s who of the nation including Prime Minister Narendra Modi. But the presence of the three mighty Khans stole the show completely.
We stumbled across these pictures of theirs where they seem to be ease with other. While the Khans appear to be smiling, Rajat Sharma, the host of the show, seems to be attacking them with his questions with his usual sheepish smile.
Seeing the three Khans under one roof and on one stage was a dream of every cinegoer in India and Rajat Sharma managed to accomplish this rarity.
Another picture from the same event was posted on Twitter by the CEO of ColorsTV – Raj Nayak.

New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked party MPs to be cautious when making comments in public in the wake of controversial remarks by Minister of State for Food Processing Industries Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti at a rally in Delhi which triggered an uproar in Parliament.
The Bharatiya Janata Party has planned over 2,000 public meetings in the national capital ahead of the assembly elections in 2015.
Sources said the Prime Minister had disapproved of Jyoti's abusive remarks during a rally in Delhi and asked party MPs to refrain from making any such comments.

Sources said that Modi did not take any name at the party's parliamentary party meeting on Tuesday but made it clear to the minister that her remarks made were not acceptable and she should express regret.
The BJP has roped in all its 325 parliamentarians from the two houses to hold meetings in Delhi, in preparation for the upcoming assembly elections, where Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) appears to be its main challenger.
Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Rajiv Pratap Rudy said meetings will be held every evening from 6 PM to 10 PM. in various areas of Delhi. Every parliamentarian has been asked to give six dates.
"The meetings started from December 1. So far, 225 MPs have given us time and dates," Rudy said.
The public meeting where Jyoti made use of foul language was one of the meetings in the series.

One southbound lane of GW Parkway reopens as sinkhole repairs continue(Related:  Commuters react to sinkhole that caused major delays on GW Parkway )
Updated at 9:16 a.m.
After 12 hours of crews working to fix a pothole that shut down the southbound lanes of the George Washington Memorial Parkway, federal highway officials said they ‘ll now try to figure out what caused the problem.
The roadway’s southbound lanes between Route 123 and Spout Run Parkway were closed all day Tuesday after a sinkhole was discovered Monday night. Crews arrived on the scene around 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday and finished fixing the roadway around 8:30 p.m. the same day. But a small portion of the roadway was still closed in the early morning hours Wednesday because the asphalt was drying in the wet, damp conditions, according to officials at the Federal Highway Administration.
The entire stretch reopened shortly after 6 a.m. Wednesday. On Tuesday, the closure of the roadway caused traffic delays throughout the morning rush hour.
Federal highway officials said Wednesday that they are not immediately sure what caused the sinkhole but are looking into it.
“They were focused on fixing the problem rather than studying it,” said Doug Hecox, a spokesman for the Federal Highway Administration, which was in charge of helping fix the pothole. He said there could be a variety of reasons for sinkholes, including water accumulating underneath the roadway or “changing geological conditions way, way underground.”
“They’re not easily predictable,” he said. He said the 12-hour fix was “especially fast when you consider all the weird weather.” Typically, it is a bit faster and easier to fix roadway problems with asphalt when it is warm and dry.
Updated at 6:06 a.m.
All of the southbound lanes on the George Washington Memorial Parkway are now open after a sinkhole shut it down Tuesday.
Updated at 4:30 a.m. Wednesday
Some of the southbound lanes of the George Washington Memorial Parkway reopened early Wednesday morning, but some work remains on part of the roadway as crews continue to fix an area where a sinkhole erupted.
A sinkhole had led to the shut down of all southbound lanes at Route 123 all day Tuesday.
In a Twitter message, the U.S. Park Police said that the GW Parkway “is open – one right lane closure SB at Windy Run is in place. All lanes will be open for morning commute.”
Around 4:30 a.m., the police said that crews were finishing up some work on the GW Parkway at Windy Run. Drivers can only get by in that section in the right lane at this time, they said.
Both of the southbound lanes on the parkway are expected to fully reopen soon, although police said they did not have a specific time on the reopening. Late Tuesday night, highway officials had said the roadway’s southbound lanes would fully reopen by 5 a.m.
The Tuesday shutdown of the parkway caused major traffic delays in the morning commute.

One southbound lane of the George Washington Memorial Parkway was reopened Tuesday night after repair of a large sinkhole which shut down the lanes at Route 123 since Monday night.
However, the U.S. Park Police said that one southbound lane of the parkway remained closed at Windy Run. Sgt. Lelani Woods said it would reopen at 4 a.m. Wednesday.
Updated at 4:01 p.m.
As work continued to repair a large sinkhole on the George Washington Memorial Parkway, Federal Highway Administration spokesman Doug Hecox said he expected the road would be entirely open to traffic by 5 a.m.
Updated at 12:46 p.m.
Work is underway to repair a large sinkhole on the southbound lanes of the George Washington Memorial Parkway at Route 123, and officials now say they expect the roadway to reopen before Wednesday morning’s rush hour.
“The backfilling is underway,” said Doug Hecox, a spokesman for the Federal Highway Administration. “We have equipment ready to begin the paving as soon as the backfilling is finished.” He said the sinkhole is being backfilled with dirt and rock.
“The current estimate,” Hecox said, is that the parkway would reopen “tomorrow before rush hour.” But he cautioned that he did not know exactly when that would be and that officials still needed to coordinate with the U.S. Park Police, the agency that helps oversees the roadway.
The southbound lanes of the GW Parkway in that area have been closed since early Tuesday morning and created a headache for commuters, with some people reporting drives of up to three hours to reach their destinations.
Hecox said federal highway crews that are now at the site have found that the sinkhole is “not as large as it was originally estimated to be.” Officials now say the sinkhole measures 10 feet by 5 feet.
Updated at 11:05 a.m.
Federal Highway officials said it is likely to take crews more than five or six hours to fix a large pothole that closed the southbound lanes of the George Washington Parkway at Route 123 on Tuesday morning.
Fixing a sinkhole of this size typically takes five to six hours — if conditions are dry and warm. But with the cold temperatures and rainy conditions, it is expected to take longer. Officials said that means it is likely that the parkway’s southbound lanes will remain closed through Tuesday evening’s rush hour and could be closed into Wednesday morning’s rush hour, as well.
“With the cold, it is likely all of the work will be done late tonight,” said Doug Hecox, a spokesman at the Federal Highway Administration. He said it will be up to the U.S. Park Police to decide when to reopen the road. Just before 11 a.m., Sgt. Lelani Woods, a spokeswoman for the park police, said in an e-mail: “It is still unknown as to how long the closures will be in effect, however, with weather permitting repair efforts can begin soon.”
One problem in fixing the sinkhole, highway officials said, is that it depends on how the asphalt reacts with the wet weather.
“Asphalt requires warmer weather and prefers drier weather,” Hecox said. “When you have water and colder weather, it complicates the behavior of the pavement.” He said crews may have to put asphalt down in chunks and may have to go back over it with a paver several times.
Federal highway officials said that roughly 60,000 vehicles a day travel that segment of the George Washington Parkway. They estimate that roughly 100,000 vehicles were affected by the closure of the GW Parkway on Tuesday morning.
Hecox said that when that portion of the GW Parkway is “out of commission, those drivers are forced onto other routes.”
“It could be that 100,000 drivers are inconvenienced by this little hole,” he said. “It is all the more reason for us to work quickly.”
He said a crew of roughly a dozen people is working to repair the roadway. “It is a heavily traveled route,” Hecox said. “We can’t afford for that road to be closed for that long.”
He said the Federal Highway Administration learned of the sinkhole around 7 p.m. Monday. Crews had to wait until daybreak Tuesday to get a better sense of the size of the hole and figure out what equipment would be needed to fix it.
The exact cause of the sinkhole is unknown, but Hecox said it could be “due to geological structures underneath” or potholes. He said the recent warm — and then cold — temperatures in the area can also create something that is known as a “freeze thaw,” where pavement expands and contracts. “That can aggravate existing potholes and make it bigger,” he said.
Updated at 9:58 a.m.
Highway officials said the George Washington Parkway southbound lanes will likely remain closed for Tuesday evening’s rush hour and not reopen until Wednesday morning.
At 9:54 a.m., Federal Highway Administration officials said equipment was coming from another project on the Clara Barton Parkway and work to fix the sinkhole on the GW Parkway’s southbound lanes at Route 123 would begin “within the next hour.” Officials said workers would begin to remove pavement and backfill the hole Tuesday afternoon.
Doug Hecox, a spokesman at the Federal Highway Administration, said the conditions of rain are “not favorable” for fixing and repaving the sinkhole. But he said, “given the tens of thousands of drivers that cont on that route, we’re going to pave in the rain anyway. It will be a rough, ugly patch.” He said it is possible that the southbound lanes of the parkway could open Tuesday but “for now, we anticipate it will be open Wednesday morning.”
Officials also closed the ramps on Interstate 495 of both the inner and outer loops to southbound George Washington Parkway at Exit 43 until further notice so crews could repair the roadway.

Earlier post:
A sinkhole has closed the southbound lanes of the George Washington Parkway at Route 123 Tuesday morning and caused several miles of traffic backups in the surrounding area. The roadway will be closed in the southbound direction until at least noon, federal highway officials said.
The southbound lanes are closed between Route 123 and Spout Run Parkway.
The hole at its surface, according to U.S. Park Police officials, measures roughly six feet wide by three feet long. But federal highway officials said their engineers have found that the size of the hole below the surface is larger. Hecox said just before 9 a.m. that the sinkhole measures 25 feet wide by 3 feet wide “from one side to the other side.” He said there is a “bigger void below the visible hole.”
“You’re just seeing the top of the hole,” Hecox said. Engineers on the scene, he said, are saying the sinkhole is 25 feet wide “from the furthest part of the void.”
“It is a big empty spot,” Hecox said. “There is a larger hole. A lot of that is underneath the pavement and you can’t see it.”
The sinkhole was discovered around 7 p.m. Monday when there was a crash involving four vehicles along the parkway, according to Sgt. Lelani Woods, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Park Police. There were no reports of injuries. Woods said it is possible that the hole may have started as a pothole and gotten larger because of weather conditions.

On Tuesday morning, there were reports of several miles of backups on the GW Parkway and some surrounding roads. U.S. Park Police  advised drivers to use alternate routes into the District, including Clara Barton Parkway, Route 50 and Glebe Road. But some drivers reported traffic was backed up along those roads as well.
Metro said its buses in the Rosslyn area are having to take alternate routes because of the sinkhole problem. At 8:30, its buses on the 15K and 15L routes were running up to one hour late in both directions.
“Traffic is backed up,” Woods said. Traffic southbound on Route 123 is bumper-to-bumper and commuters are seeing tail lights, as far back as Interstate 495, she said. Drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Virginia Department of Transportation officials said just before 8 a.m. that there were roughly four-mile backups along Interstate 495 north as a spillover from the GW Parkway closure.

A major stretch of the southbound lanes of the George Washington Memorial Parkway in Arlington and Fairfax counties is closed Tuesday morning because of a large sinkhole.
The sinkhole developed Monday night. The GW Parkway is closed between Route 123 and Spout Run Parkway. The sinkhole is located just south of Route 123.
The closure is expected to last through Tuesday morning’s rush hour, according to the U.S. Park Police. The northbound lanes of the parkway are open.

2010-12: Over 4 000 died on shop floor but thats fraction of totalConcerted effort to manipulate machinery: Court in coal case
At around 2.30 pm on October 21, three days before this Diwali, a blast at the Manikanta Fireworks manufacturing unit in the coastal village of Vakathippa near Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh left behind a trail of destruction and 17 bodies. The intensity of the blast at the tiled manufacturing unit was such that the bodies of the victims — 14 of them young women who earned Rs 150 per day — were found strewn nearly 30 metres away in an adjoining rice field.
Four years ago, S Ambiga, a line operator at the Nokia factory in Tamil Nadu’s Sriperumbudur – one of the most modern assembling units in the country – succumbed to her injuries in a hospital after being hit by the arm of an automatic loader machine while reportedly trying to retrieve an electronic chip board on the evening of October 31.
In the first case, chances are that the 17 who lost their lives will not even figure in the official statistics on industrial fatalities as the firecracker manufacturing is bracketed in the informal sector and the Kakinada unit was operating on an expired licence.
In the second, Ambiga was one of the 75 fatalities in 2010 from Tamil Nadu, a state that is among half a dozen others that have seen high accidental fatalities in industrial units, according to data from 2010 to 2012 collected by the Labour Ministry’s Directorate General, Factory Advice Service and Labour Institutes (DGFASLI) from the Chief Inspector of factories of states and union territories.
At Sriperumbudur, the accident happened at about 6.50 pm and Ambiga remained trapped till 7.15 pm, according to testimonies that the factory workers furnished to an inquiry committee. While the Nokia management said that the company investigated the circumstances that led to the accident “as per factory norms and guidelines”, neither the company’s report nor the official inquiry report, prepared by the then Labour Commissioner Hans Raj Varma and submitted to the state government, have been made public. The Nokia India spokesperson did not respond to an email sent on Monday by The Indian Express with a query on the accident.
In statistical terms, a clear trend is that apart from Tamil Nadu, states such as Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Kerala, Punjab and Maharashtra are among those that have either witnessed a steady increase in industrial fatalities or seen high numbers during the last three years for which official data is available.
In absolute terms, the fatalities are the highest in industrialised states such as Gujarat and Maharashtra, as also in resource-rich states such as Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, where mining is a major industrial activity. But the official statistics are updated only till 2012.
But clearly, there are more deaths occurring in the interiors of India’s industrial landscape that do not get documented. Official statistics suggest there were 4,275 documented fatalities in Indian factories between 2010 and 2012. Analysts say that even by the most conservative estimate, the actual numbers could be at least ten times higher if the accidents in the unorganised manufacturing sector are counted.
For a more updated count, The Indian Express collated data of reported industrial accidents across the country in just the last five months and counted at least 63 fatalities, including of the 17 who died in the Kakinada incident.
Venu Srinivasan, Managing Director of Sundaram-Clayton Ltd., and Chairman of TVS Motor Co. Ltd., is also the Chairman of the National Safety Council. He says that while the safety record of the Indian organised manufacturing sector doesn’t fare too poorly by global standards and the gap is gradually being bridged, concerns remain about the safety standards of the unorganised sector.
In a 2005 report, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) had estimated that there could be 40,000 industrial fatalities in India on an average every year, with the actual number of injuries and deaths vastly under-reported because nearly 90 per cent of those employed outside of farming form part of the unorganised, informal sector.
According to P K Das, general secretary of the Steel Workers’ Federation of India and governor, National Safety Council, a major reason for accidents in sectors such as steel is the ‘lowest tender system’, which forces public sector companies to engage contractors, and sometimes subcontractors, who lack experience and expertise for highly specialised jobs.
In most cases, accidents are a direct result of safety norms being ignored, as was evident in the June 27 GAIL pipeline blast. An inquiry report on the incident, submitted to the Home Ministry in September, highlighted the fact that had GAIL – a blue-chip, cash-rich, government company – installed the safety features it had promised the Chief Controller of Explosives (CCOE) while seeking his approval for the project in July 2001, the accident would not have happened.
In its application submitted to CCOE on July 24, 2001, GAIL had committed to setting up a gas dehydration unit at the start of the pipeline to strip water and condensate from “wet” natural gas so as to prevent pipeline corrosion and leakage of inflammable condensate and gas in the open. So while the pipeline was designed for handling dry natural gas, it was being regularly used for transporting wet gas, without the accompanying safety precaution. A senior GAIL officer said the company is in the process of “filling up all the deficiencies pointed out by the committee”.
A series of “freak” accidents in SAIL’s flagship Bhilai plant over the last five months, which resulted in the loss of eight lives, including that of two deputy general managers and an assistant general manager, has now forced a renewed safety vigil across the state-owned steel major’s plants, S.S. Mohanty, Director (Technical), SAIL, told The Indian Express.
For some sectors, there is little hope of a turnaround in the safety record. At 2 per 1,000, the rate of fatal accidents among ship workers at Alang, the world’s largest ship-breaking yard, is several times higher than the 0.27 per 1,000 for the mining industry, which is generally considered to be India’s most unsafe occupation.
The preliminary findings of a study commissioned by the National Human Rights Commission and conducted by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences on Alang – released in May this year — point to an almost complete lack of enforcement of safety regulations, inadequate health facilities and an abysmal track record of punishing those found guilty of violations.
According to TVS’s Srinivasan, going beyond manufacturing, construction and road safety are areas where the gap between Indian and global standards is the highest.
In the US, all accidents are investigated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), an agency of the Department of Labor. In addition, there are specialised bodies such as the US Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, an independent federal agency that investigates accidents involving industrial chemicals, and with the mandate to pursue changes in systems and practices.
In India, though, inquiry reports dished out by ad hoc committees headed by bureaucrats or labour commissioners are largely seen as fire-fighting measures that are simply not intended to bring about systemic change. Till that changes, the shop-floor could be a very unsafe place to be.

GST: Finance Ministry Proposes 3-Year Compensation for StatesChina December Industrial Activity Shrinks for First Time in 7 Months
New Delhi: The Finance Ministry has proposed to compensate states for three years for losses they may incur on account of switching to a nationwide Goods and Services Tax(GST) regime, as against a demand for a five-year compensation.
"We have tentatively finalised the GST Draft Amendment Bill and have sent it for legislative vetting. The ministry has offered a compensation for 3 years to states for losses incurred on account of switching to the proposed indirect tax regime," Additional Revenue Secretary Rashmi Verma said at an event here.
The states have demanded that such compensations be provided by the Centre for a period of five years under the GST regime, for which the government wants to introduce a Bill in the current session of Parliament.
The GST rollout has missed several deadlines because of lack of consensus among states over certain crucial issues on the new tax regime, which the present government wants to roll out from April 1, 2016.
Ms Verma further said that Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will meet State Finance Ministers on December 11 to build consensus on issues related to inclusion of petroleum products, entry tax and compensation funds.
On Monday, Mr Jaitley had expressed hope that the much-awaited GST Bill would be introduced in the current session of Parliament.
"We will try and introduce GST Bill in this session...GST Bill would be taken up by the Cabinet after Empowered Committee (of state finance Minister) meeting on December 12," he had said.
GST will subsume indirect taxes like excise duty and service tax at the central level and VAT on the states front, besides local levies.
There are differences between the central and state governments on some issues with regard to the implementation of GST that includes the revenue neutral rate and keeping petroleum, liquor out of the ambit.
While a sub-committee on GST has suggested that the revenue neutral rate of GST be pegged at about 27 per cent, the states are yet to decide on it.
It had suggested states GST at 13.91 per cent and Central GST at 12.77 per cent.
Besides, states have been demanding that petroleum, alcohol and tobacco should be kept out of the purview of GST.
The GST Constitutional Amendment Bill, which was introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2011, had lapsed and the NDA government will be required to come up with a fresh Bill.

09:55am Monte Carlo IPO opens
Ludhiana-based woollen and cotton apparel manufacturer Monte Carlo Fashions (MCFL) has opened its public issue of 54.33 lakh equity shares for subscription today.
The company has fixed price band of Rs 630-645 per share or the issue, which will close on December 5, 2014. Bids can be made for minimum 23 equity shares and in multiple of 23 shares thereafter.
Monte Carlo, the apparel retail chain, aims to garner Rs 342-350 crore through the issue by diluting 25 percent shareholding.
There is no fresh issue of shares. Promoters (including Oswal family & members and other companies) will reduce their stake from 81.06 percent to 63.63 percent and Smara Capital, a Mauritius-based PE firm (through its affilliate, KIL had acquired stake in Monte Carlo in June 2012) will cut its shareholding from 18.51 percent to 10.94 percent through this issue.
09:30am Market Expert
Rakesh Arora, Macquarie says India's impressive return of 36 percent in 2014 year-to-date has been driven by 15 percent PE re-rating and 19 percent forward EPS growth.
“The current multiple of 15x PE and 3x P/B are a tad above long-term average and consistent with implied 6.5-7 percent GDP growth. Despite the outperformance relative to global markets, the Indian market is still below previous valuation peaks,” he adds.
Arora says the brokerage believes the market can re-rate further to 16-17x if economic recovery is stronger-than-expected. “Our 12-month Nifty target is 9,940 based on 15x FY17e EPS,” he adds.
09:15am Market Check
Equity benchmarks opened flat on Wednesday despite positive Asian cues. The Sensex rose 9.05 points to 28453.06 and the Nifty climbed 6.85 points to 8531.55.
About 589 shares have advanced, 159 shares declined, and 33 shares are unchanged on the Bombay Stock Exchange.
Tata Motors, BHEL, Mahindra & Mahindra, Tata Steel, Bajaj Auto, Jindal Steel and Larsen & Toubro are top gainers in early trade, up 0.8-2 percent.
However, ITC lost 2 percent followed by Infosys, Dr Reddy's Labs, Sesa Sterlite, Gail India and Coal India with more than 0.5 percent loss.
In the broader space, BGR Energy, Havells India, Surya Roshni and Bajaj Electricals gained 5-10 percent. Max India and Reliance Capital gained 2-5 percent. 
The Indian rupee opened flat at 61.87 per dollar today against 61.88 a dollar in previous session.
The dollar hovers at a seven-year high against the Japanese yen , following a broad rally overnight, thanks in part to a big rise in US yields.
Pramit Brahmbhatt of Veracity expects the rupee to trade rangebound to slightly weak tracking the local equity market movement. "Range for the USD-INR pair is seen between 61.50-62.30/dollar," he says.
On the global front, US stocks gained, with the Dow striking another peak, as investors cheered better-than-expected November auto sales. The CBOE volatility index, one measure of investor uncertainty, fell 10.1 percent to 12.85 percent.
Meanwhile, Asian markets traded higher with the Nikkei and Shanghai rising 1 percent each. Reports suggest that People's Bank of China may unveil a cut in reserve requirements for banks.
In commodities, crude prices stayed steady after industry data showed a larger than expected drop in crude oil inventories in the United States.

South Korean officials expressed fear on December 2, of a huge death toll after rescuers failed to find any of the more than 50 fishermen missing after their ship sank amid high waves in the freezing waters of the western Bering Sea on Monday.
Authorities rescued seven crew members and recovered one body, but weather and water conditions complicated the search for the others, an official from the South Korean fisheries and oceans ministry said on condition of anonymity because of office rules.
The crew included 35 Indonesians, 13 Filipinos, 11 South Koreans and one Russian inspector, the official said. Russian authorities said there were 62 people aboard the ship, which sank in the western part of the Bering Sea, near Russia.
The South Korean ministry official said it’s believed that the ship, which was catching pollock, began to list after stormy weather caused seawater to flood its storage areas. Kim Kang-ho from Sajo Industries, the canned tuna company that owns the ship, said the 2,000-ton vessel was 36 years old.
An official from South Korea’s foreign ministry, who refused to be named citing office rules, said Tuesday morning that the death toll was expected to rise because rescuers failed to find any of the missing passengers. Four fishing ships that were operating nearby continue to search for survivors, but harsh weather conditions have limited their mobility, the official said.
South Korean Prime Minister Chung Hong-won vowed told a Cabinet meeting that the government will work with Russia to speed up the rescue efforts.
Authorities in the Russian port of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky said the rescued fishermen were well and would be taken to South Korea once the weather improves.
“The condition of the fishermen who were rescued is fine,” Artur Rets, chief of the rescue center at the Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky port, told the RIA Novosti news agency.
Kim from Sajo said the ship left for the Bering Sea from Busan, South Korea, on July 10 for the Bering Sea to catch pollock, a winter delicacy in South Korea.
Another official from Sajo, who did not want to be named, said the ship had eight lifeboats and that the seven fishermen who survived and the person later found dead used one of them to continued…

Maharashtra government seeks Rs 4 500cr package from Centre to help farmersBy: Press Trust of India | Mumbai |
Posted: December 3, 2014 10:10 am
Concerned over the recent farmer suicides, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has said his government is working round-the-clock to mitigate their hardships and has sought a Rs 4,500 crore financial package from the Centre to provide them necessary assistance.
The Chief Minister said he was saddened by reports of farmers committing suicide because of bad crop and drought and appealed to the farmers not to lose heart and assured them that his government was doing all that is possible to help them.
The drought situation is severe and decisions like waiving electricity bills, fees waiver of 10th and 12th class students in drought-hit areas, restructuring of crop loan and stay on recovery of loan have already been taken, Fadnavis said in a statement issued here.
He said that his government was constantly monitoring the situation and firmly stood by the farmers in the grave situation.
A 75-year-old farmer, distressed over crop failure, had allegedly ended his life at a village in Akola district last week.
Besides, seven suicides by debt-ridden farmers were reported in the past few days from Vidarbha, which was toured by Fadnavis last week, according to Vidarbha Janandolan Samiti (VJS), an NGO which has been tracking such deaths.
With these deaths, the number of farmer suicides in the cotton belt, facing water scarcity and agrarian crisis, has gone up to 1,022 till now this year, Samiti’s president Kishore Tiwari recently claimed.
A delegation of farmers led by Tiwari had met Fadnavis in Amravati last week and presented a list of demands.

Post Sukma Maoist attack, call for Raman Singh’s ouster grows louder within BJP

(RSS had a hands-off approach…)
NEW DELHI: Chhattisgarh CM Raman Singh is under fire for repeated Maoist attacks in his state, with a growing demand for his ouster from even within BJP. BJP president Amit Shah is scheduled to visit Raipur on December 10 to meet party MLAs and seek their views. "There might not be any developments in the next few weeks, but a message will certainly be delivered to the CM," a senior BJP leader said.
Congress, too, demanded dismissal of his government in Lok Sabha on Tuesday in the wake of yet another Maoist ambush in Sukma.
For BJP leaders, Singh's failure to curb Maoist violence tops the list of issues that they have against him. Home Minister Rajnath Singh visited the state Capital and said: "Naxal violence is a national problem. Centre and the state will jointly fight this menace," he said.
However, voices against Raman were growing within the party and there were several disgruntled MLAs and workers in the state. "It is getting difficult to defend the CM as he does not appear to be in control of the law and order situation. Earlier, he was getting away by blaming the Centre when UPA was in power," the BJP leader added.
Sources in BJP claim earlier RSS had a hands-off approach regarding Raman, but now with unabated Naxal terror in the state, even Sangh favours a tough position against him. Sources in security establishment said NSA Ajit Doval also spoke to Raman Singh, asking him for a detailed report on the Sukma operation.
This is not the first time that Maoists have struck in the state with impunity. In the same district near Chintalnar, 76 CRPF personnel had lost their lives in a Maoist attack in 2010. Almost the entire top Congress leadership of the state was wiped out in a ruthless attack last year before assembly polls.
"There is the example of Andhra Pradesh government that managed to tackle the Maoist problem effectively by following the policy of clear, hold and develop. Chhattisgarh, however, has shown no will to fight the Maoists at all," an intelligence official told ET.
"It is easy to blame the state but where is the Centre's cogent policy to fight Maoists. The Centre needs to get the unified command in place to fight the menace," an aide of the CM said.

(Every year UN recognises…)
LIMA: Four grassroots projects from India will be awarded by an initiative spearheaded by the United Nations Framework Convention that recognises innovative and transformative solutions to address climate change as well as wider economic, social and environmental challenges.
Resolve: Trash2Cash, a Kolkata-based initiative that has found a way to convert trash into cash providing a solution for solid waste problems in urban areas, is one of the projects that made it to the final 12 selected for the Momentum for Change awards.
More than 5,000 tonnes of solid waste is generated each day in Kolkata. Given the manner in which solid waste in currently being dumped, Kolkata's solid waste has ended up polluting the ground water and emitting large amounts of methane, a gas that is 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide in trapping heat.
The Resolve: Trash2Cash initiative of the South Asian Forum for Environment is an independent community enterprise led by people who live in the slums and are trained and paid to collect and recycle corporate and household waste.
Organic waste is diverted from landfills to make compost, while paper waste is recycled and used for making handicrafts in aworkshop run by women.
In this manner, by collecting an average of 1,000 kg of waste paper and 2,000 kg of organic or food waste each month, slum dwellers involved in this initiative are helping reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 520 metric tonnes a year.
Bhungroo, an initiative in Gujarat to deal with drought, is another project being awarded at Lima. Bhungroo is a water management system that injects and stores excess rainwater underground and uses it in dry spells.
This initiative of artificially recharging the aquifers also helps reduce salt deposits on soil, besides increasing supply of fresh water. Some 18,000 marginal farmers have benefited from this initiative.
The Gujarat Ecology Commission has replicated this initiative in other parts of the state. Bhungroo's success lies in the fact that it has helped women become free of debt. The project is being replicated in parts of Africa as well.
The other two projects which will be awarded in Lima are an effort to reduce energy consumption in real time by using technology, thereby helping industrial and commercial users to reduce carbon emissions, and a community-based early flood warning system in the Himalayan region to help improve the resilience of 45 vulnerable communities.
Every year, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change identifies grassroots efforts which contribute to the effort to move countries on to a highresilience low-carbon path.
These projects, known as Lighthouse Activities, are meant to focus on efforts, which are already under way to address climate change and can be replicated and scaled up.

Australia bids farewell to Phillip Hughes in hometown funeral

(Bowler Sean Abbott, who…)
MACKSVILLE (AUSTRALIA): Australia bid an emotional farewell to cricketer Phillip Hughes at a funeral in his hometown on Wednesday with a live coast-to-coast broadcast allowing a nation to unite in celebration and remembrance of the life of a sportsman cut down in his prime.
Eight days after Hughes was struck by a ball to the back of the head, and six after he died of catastrophic injuries resulting from the freak incident, his family, friends and a host of cricketing greats gathered at Macksville High School.
From the eulogies given they learned of a beloved son, brother, cousin and friend whose passion for cricket was matched only by his enthusiasm for the Angus cattle he helped raise on the family farm.
They were also reminded of a small town boy with a prodigious talent for hitting a ball with a bat who headed down the coast to big city Sydney as a teenager and ended up playing 26 tests for his country.
Australia captain Michael Clarke broke down in tears for the second time in a few days as he paid public tribute to his former team mate and friend, who would have been 26 last Sunday.
"Phillip's spirit, which is now part of our game forever, will act as a custodian of the sport we all love. We must listen to it," he said, struggling to contain his emotions.
"We must cherish it. We must learn from it. We must dig in and get through to tea. And we must play on.
"So rest in peace my little brother. I will see you out in the middle."
Some 1,000 mourners, mostly locals with a smattering of luminaries including Prime Minister Tony Abbott, dabbed away tears and perspiration in the baking heat of the school hall with thousands more watching on screens in the sunshine outside.
Australian greats of the game such as Shane Warne, Ricky Ponting and Glenn McGrath were in attendance, while Richard Hadlee, Brian Lara and India captain Virat Kohli represented the wider cricket world.
The service was broadcast live on international television news networks and shown on big screens in Australia's major cities, including at the Sydney Cricket Ground where Hughes suffered the fatal injury during a state match last Tuesday.
BAT TRIBUTES
Hughes was batting for a recall to the Australia side for the opening match in the test series against India -- since rescheduled -- when he suffered the injury that killed him.
The number 63, the runs Hughes had accumulated when he was struck by the ball, has become inextricably linked with the tragedy, as has 408, a reference to him becoming the 408th man to play test cricket for Australia in 2009.
Most of all though, it is the viral campaign to get people to place cricket bats in tribute outside homes, workplaces and at sports grounds that has become the most common manifestation of the outpouring of grief around the world.
That was reflected by Hughes's own bat, stood up against the coffin throughout the service, which concluded with "Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me", the song Elton John dedicated to Hughes when he played it in a concert in Munich last week.
Clarke and fellow cricketers Aaron Finch and Tom Cooper joined Hughes's father and brother among the pallbearers who delivered the coffin to the hearse, which then set off in a procession through the town.

Another video of the Rohtak girls, who thrashed three eve-teasers with belts and punches, went viral on Tuesday, in which they were seen beating up and abusing a boy sitting in HUDA City Park.
The new video has sparked a debate in social circles and polarised the issue. People raised eyebrows as the video shows the duo thrashing and using expletives against a boy. Pooja Kuhar, the younger of the two sisters, said this incident occurred around two months ago. She said they beat him because he had passed a lewd comment at them.
She added that she, along with her sister, Aarti Kuhar, had beaten up several boys in last one year and many more such video can surface.
On being asked on how they felt about the limelight on them, Pooja said, "We are not interested in becoming a star or seeking publicity at the cost of our dignity. We are simple girls but what sets us apart is that we believe that tolerating injustice is also wrong, which other girls might face quietly," adding, "The support came from society after the incident was highlighted by the media and it has made us stronger and we feel safer."
The younger sister, Aarti, also had a message to other girls, "If a boy passes a lewd comment on girl, a girl's first mistake is to take it casually."
Meanwhile, the three accused - Kuldeep, Deepak and Mohit - were granted bail. Confirming the development, Rohtak jail superintendent Daya Nand said they were released on Monday.

Nov services activity grows at fastest pace in 5 monthsIn November, services activity grows at fastest pace in 5 months
BS Reporter | New Delhi Dec 04, 2014 12:50 AM IST
In November, activity in India’s services sector expanded at its fastest pace in five months, mainly driven by new order flows. But there was a decline in hiring, the first time in four months, showed the widely-tracked HSBC Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) data released on Wednesday.
The index rose to 52.6 in the month, compared with 50 in October. A reading above 50 means expansion, while one below that implies contraction.  The reading in November, however, was below the series average and sentiment remained subdued, especially with the decline seen in hiring. Markit  Economics, which compiles the PMI data, said services growth had little impact on employment during the month. Also, new business sentiment slipped to the weakest since mid-2007, implying continued reforms were needed to sustain growth uptick.
“Service sector activity grew in November, as new business rose for a seventh straight month. However, despite an uptick in order flows, business sentiment deteriorated. It reminds us that a continued policy action to addresses investor concerns is required for sustaining the growth momentum,” said Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC.
Annual services growth in the July-September quarter of this financial year was 7.05 per cent, compared with 6.80 per cent in the April-June period, according to official data. Still, India’s year-on-year gross domestic product growth in the three months to September 30 slowed to 5.3 per cent from 5.7 per cent in the June quarter, as industry, manufacturing in particular, did not pick up.
Manufacturing PMI data, released a day earlier, had revealed that the country’s manufacturing activity in November had grown at the fastest rate in 21 months (53.3 points on the index). The Composite PMI Output Index — manufacturing and services taken together — for the month stands at a five-month high level of 53.6, up from 51.0 in October.
ALSO READ:  Manufacturing PMI at 21-month high in November
Even if one takes PMI as a broad indicator of activities, data for December would be crucial for services sector to gauge any number for third quarter growth in services since October and November showed too much variation.
Post & telecommunications was the best-performing segment in the services sector, while financial intermediation and hotels & restaurants saw contraction.
Business activity in November was driven by faster growth of new ventures. The new business sub-index accelerated to 52.5, its highest level since July.
Meanwhile, input costs fell for the first time since March 2009. The rate at which input prices decreased was the second-quickest in the survey’s nine-year history. Despite manufacturers reporting stronger inflationary pressures, the overall rate of cost inflation in the private sector eased to the weakest in the current 68-month sequence of rising prices.
Subsequently, prices charged by Indian services firms deteriorated, for the first time in more than four years, in November. That said, the overall pace at which selling prices fell was fractional.
A faster rise for goods producers did not prevent the rate of private-sector output inflation from easing to the joint-slowest in more than four years.
Bhandari, who had on Monday advised that the Reserve Bank exercise caution in easing its monetary stance, as there were price pressures on the manufacturing side, did not offer any suggestion this time.
On Tuesday, at the bi-monthly review of its monetary policy, RBI refrained from easing its stance but hinted it might do so next year, depending on price pressures.

Binny to explore real estate segment with around 75 acre land bankBinny to enter realty business with 75-acre land bank
Gireesh Babu | Chennai Dec 08, 2014 12:42 AM IST
Binny Limited, merging into itself Mohan Breweries and Distilleries, has set its focus on the real estate and liquor markets, with 75 acres available for the latter.
The company recently signed an agreement with real estate firm SPR Group to develop an integrated township on a 63-acre parcel where the Binny Mills complex is situated in Perambur.
Binny, which had stopped its operations in textiles and other business earlier, has been an asset holding company. It has now decided to merge its alcoholic beverages business, Mohan Breweries and Distilleries, with itself.  It is planning to set up a facility in Kancheepuram with an investment of Rs 300 crore, to shift its existing operations within Chennai.
“Our focus will be on the real estate and liquor business. We have entered into a tie-up with SPR Group to develop a 63-acre land parcel out of 85 acres we have in Binny into a township. The rest of the land is in three parcels near to it which is still with us. Besides, we have a land bank of 55 acres under Mohan Breweries and Distilleries,” said M Nandagopal, executive chairman, Binny Ltd.
He said the company will decide on the development of these land parcels at a later stage. Mohan Breweries has also sold 12 acres it owned to SPR Group, for around Rs 244 crore. “We are also shifting the liquor manufacturing facility from inside the city to Kancheepuram. The existing facility is within the city, and there is no space for anything. The labourers also have to travel long hours to come to the factory and back to their home,” said Nandagopal.
He said that the process of setting up the facility would start soon and it would take 18-24 months to complete the project. The capacity of the plant will remain the same. At present, the company has the capacity to manufacture 10 million cases of beer and 7.5 million cases of IMFL. It currently holds around 12-15% of the IMFL market and around 20% of the beer market in Tamil Nadu.
When asked whether the company would look at development of real estate projects on its own in the land bank, he said the company will take a call depending on the situation.
The company informed the exchanges on Monday that its Board of Directors were apprised of its deal with SPR Group. 
The Board has also accorded in-principal approval for the merger of Mohan Breweries and Distilleries along with its subsidiary Arthos Breweries with Binny and directed the company to submit the scheme of merger for final approval.

Militants ambush Lebanese troops  kill 6 near Syria borderBy: Associated Press | Beirut |
Posted: December 3, 2014 11:03 am
Militants ambushed a Lebanese army patrol near the border with Syria on Tuesday, killing six soldiers and wounding one, the military said.
The attack occurred in a remote region of Ras Baalbek in eastern Lebanon, and the military responded by rushing in reinforcements, the Lebanese army said in a statement.
It was not immediately clear who was behind the attack, but Lebanese troops have been battling Syria-based Islamic militants, including the extremist Islamic State group and the Nusra Front, in areas near the border.
Local media said dozens of militants took part in the attack.
In August, the militant groups seized some 20 Lebanese soldiers and police officers during a brief cross-border raid on the Lebanese border town of Arsal. The extremists have already killed three of the captives, beheading two of them.
The plight of the remaining captive soldiers and policemen and their families has gripped Lebanon in the past weeks. Relatives of the hostages are staging an ongoing sit-in and blocking roads in Beirut to pressure the government to negotiate with the militants.

Manipur government extends  disturbed area status  for one more yearBy: Press Trust of India | Imphal |
Posted: December 3, 2014 11:05 am
The ‘disturbed area status’ for Manipur under the controversial Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) has been extended for another year from December 1.
The decision was taken at a Cabinet meeting on December 1 last after considering the overall situation of the state, state education minister and government spokesman M Okendro said.
Section 3 of the AFSPA empowers the state government to extend the disturbed area over the entire state or some selected areas, Okendro said.
Except the eight assembly segments in the Imphal Municipal Council in the city, the disturbed area status would be applicable to the valley and hill districts in the rest of the state.
“Taking serious note of frequent bomb blasts and other acts of violence, the government considered it necessary to extend the disturbed area status in the state,” the spokesman said
The AFSPA, which was imposed in the state since September 1980, has been extended from time to time, the sources said.
It would continue to be in force till further orders, the sources said.
The extension will allow security forces to operate and aid civil administration to flush out insurgents.

Beware! Are online retailers selling counterfeits Brands think so(Bangalore-based Chumbak,…)
By Biswarup Gooptu, Jayadevan PK & Bharat Joshi
DELHI/BENGALURU: Consumer brands and channel partners are turning the heat on India's online retailers, accusing them of not only undercutting prices but also encouraging the sale of counterfeit goods by sellers of dubious origins on their sites.
It's round two in the increasingly attritional offline-online war, as India's yet-nascent, but fast growing e-commerce companies bid to grab a larger slice of the country's estimated $500-billion retail sector.
"We have invested over Rs 100 crore in brand and channel development but it seems to be nobody's problem except ours," said Sahil Sani, the owner of Mumbai-based Sahil International, a channel partner to global audio and infotainment giant Harman International Industries .
Sani recently discovered that a seller on Snapdeal was retailing counterfeit goods under the JBL brand, for which his company has the exclusive distribution rights in India.
The issue came to Sani's attention when a Bengaluru-based offline retailer, Maneesh Singhvi, ordered JBL Pulse bluetooth wireless speakers from Snapdeal. On discovering that the product was neither sold or manufactured by JBL, Singhvi filed a complaint with the city's Upparpet police station.
According to the first information report (FIR), which has been seen by ET, Snapdeal, the seller by the name Manisha Ashwin Kumar Farekh and the delivery company Delhivery have been named as accused.
"This is a clear case of cheating and investigations are going on," said a senior officer investigating the case.
Other brands have made similar complaints against online portals. Alok Chawla, founder and chief executive of Gizmobaba, an online retailer of electronic gadgets, said that they have complained to Snapdeal about sellers on the marketplace selling inferior quality goods, tagged under the Gizmobaba brand.
The response from New Delhi-based Snapdeal has been extremely lukewarm so far, said Chawla. Both Delhivery and Snapdeal did not respond to a questionnaire sent by ET.
"Snapdeal has refused to take off the the listings of the clearly inferior products. We have even sent them our trademark registration certificate, but they just do not seem to care," said Chawla.
Snapdeal, which claims to have over 25 million registered users, currently has over 50,000 sellers on its marketplace, the largest in India, and has targeted having a million sellers on board over the course of the next 12 months.
Gizmobaba, which sources all its products from Chinese manufacturers, but sells them under its own brand, is actively considering its legal options.
"We used to sell 70-80 products on Snapdeal, but have reduced that to 20-25 products right now," he said.
The Mumbai-based venture has also been facing a similar issue with Amazon . "We talked to Amazon's seller support, who have escalated the issue to their legal team. Therefore, we are a lot more hopeful," Chawla said.
Bangalore-based Chumbak, which designs and sells goods online has faced similar issues on various e-commerce portals including Flipkart and eBay . ,
"We noticed the problem in September, when a couple of customers came to our kiosks in Delhi-NCR and told our sales staff that they had bought a product and the design is peeling off. We realised these were fake," said Vivek Prabhakar, co-founder of the Bengaluru-based kitsch brand.
There isn't a lot brands can do against a marketplace or the delivery company with only the seller being found liable in such cases. Legal expert Baljit Singh Kalha said, "At a minimum online marketplaces should face the same criminal and civil liabilities, as that of offline retailers."
Kalha, a partner at Titus & Co added that in India, marketplaces can conveniently push the blame on to the seller because India's Consumer Protection Act hasn't really taken cognisance of e-commerce.
"India's Consumer Protection Act does not have the provisions to really protect the consumer in such a case, or hold the marketplace liable for the sale of counterfeit goods, since the e-commerce company can possibly say that they are just a 'mandi,' or a platform, and are not responsible for the actions of the sellers on the same," said Kalha.

Japanese telcos to meet Ravi Shankar Prasad ...Japanese Delegation
(The Japanese delegation…)
KOLKATA: Executives of Japanese telecom firms NTT Communications , NEC Corp and KDDI Corp and top officials from the country's internal affairs and communications ministry will call on telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Wednesday to explore a clutch of mega technology joint ventures, two persons familiar with the matter told ET.
The joint ventures are likely to be formed in the fields of green mobile base stations manufacturing, cyber and network security, disaster management and ICT applications for social and economic challenges, they said.
Telecom secretary Rakesh Garg and senior officials of the telecom department will be present in the meeting of the Indo-Japan joint working group, which will explore ways to strengthen cooperation and bilateral ties between the two countries in the realm of IT and telecom.
Representatives of Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) and Telecom Equipment Manufacturers Association (Tema) will also be present in the meeting that will be chaired by Prasad, who is also the IT minister. The Japanese delegation will be led by Yasuo Sakamoto, vice minister for policy coordination and international affairs in the country's communications ministry.
According to the persons cited earlier, senior officials of Fujitsu, Hitachi and Toyota Motor Co are also likely to attend the meeting of the Indo-Japan joint working group.
Both countries will explore the possibility of joint projects during Wednesday's meeting. The proposal of developing mobile base-stations running on green energy has been proposed by Japan's KDDI Corporation while the disaster management project has been suggested by NTT Communications. The cyber and networks security projects have been proposed by Japan's internal affairs and communications ministry, said one of the persons.
The green mobile base station is likely to elicit much enthusiasm from the telecom department, especially at a time when it is exhorting telecom operators to reduce carbon emissions and progressively switch to green energy variants like solar, wind or fuel cell to run telecom towers.
Japan is particularly keen to participate in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Digital India mass broadband initiative and telecom giant SoftBank recently announced plans to invest over $10 billion in India over the next few years. SoftBank is one of Japan's biggest telecom and internet groups, with operations in broadband, fixed line telecom, e-commerce, finance, media and marketing.
Japan is a global manufacturing powerhouse churning out a $1 trillion of goods that constitute about 20% of its $5 trillion GDP.
"The reforms agenda unleashed by the new government, including the Digital India initiative, provides opportunity for Japanese companies to invest in India, particularly in the ICT, where 100% foreign ownership is permitted," said a statement issued by the government on Tuesday.

10 startup projects that were way ahead of t...10 startup projects that were ahead of time

Aeolipile
(There were many ancient…)
In 1901, in the wreckage of a Greek ship, explorers found the world's oldest computer. According to latest findings, released last week, Antikythera Mechanism is dated back to 205 BC.
The mechanism that could predict lunar and solar eclipses ran on 30 bronze gears placed in a wooden box. But this wasn't the only ancient mechanical marvels that were way ahead of their time.
Asha Menon lists some of them:
Robot Servant
(3RD CENTURY BC)
Budgee, the helper robot, melted a few hearts at a robotics event this year in Boston. But his goofy look is a striking contrast to his earliest ancestor, Philon's stately Greek robot, which could refill and mix water in a wine glass. Place an empty wine glass in the Greek's left hand and it would refill it from the wine holder in the right. It worked air pipes, tubes, containers and springs to perform this task.
Archimedes Claw or the Iron Hand
(AROUND 220 BC)
In 214 BC, when the Roman naval fleet approached Syracuse with 60 of its famed quinqueremes, which were the heaviest warships of the time that required 90 oars on each side, a massive claw lifted from under the sea and tossed them away and about.
Burning Mirrors
(214-212 BC)
Remember burning little bits of paper by focussing sun's rays on them?
Syracuse did that to warships. They focussed heat rays on invading ships with copper and bronze mirrors. In 1973, when an experiment recreated the effect, pointing 70 mirrors at a model of a warship that was 50 metres away, the ship burst into flames -in a few seconds.
King Tut's chariot
(1323 BC)
It has been often been compared to a modern day Ferrari for its design and performance, combining kinematics and lubrication. It had a design that could absorb shock during racing (including the flexible wood rim), wheels that could be changed within a minute and spokes made from elastic wood to absorb soil irregularities (much like modern day suspension).
Archimedes Screw
(287 BC-212 BC)
In 2001, John Burland used a large, screw-like contraption to correct the lean of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. This was designed centuries ago by Archimedes to remove excess water from the hull of a ship, which was designed for luxury travel of about 600 people. A revolving screw inside a cylinder helps move water from a lower plane to a higher plane. Today it is even used used for irrigation.
Prefabricated Forts
(220 BC)
Prefab homes now come with futuristic designs, but they were earlier designed by Akbar in the 16th C. But Romans predated this too, they erected prefabricated forts! They standardised the size of their forts, made manuals and carried timber, of specified dimensions, with grooves cut into them. Speed won wars.
Vending Machine
(IN FIRST CENTURY AD)
Slot machines today dispense carbonated drinks, mostly.However, the concept of these machines started with dispensing holy water.Heron of Alexandria designed such a machine. Drop a coin and the weight of it would keep the lever (which opened a valve) down. So the weight of the coin determined how much water (holy water, then) would be given.
  Automatic Theatre
(10-70 AD)
Today stage automation involves specialised software or radio-controlled machinery and millions of dollars. In the first century, Greek (again) mathematician and engineer Heron pioneered the concept with mechanics. He carefully timed and weighted the movement of threads with axles and reels. With this miniature theatre, he told the tragic tale of Ajax who leads a Greek fleet after the Trojan War.
Water clocks
Different people have different dates of their origin, some even trace it back to 4,000 BC in China. India too had one in Nalanda (Fifth Century), which measured four hours of daylight and four hours of night time. It consisted of a copper bowl, placed into a larger bowl. Water was fed into the inside one through a hole at the bottom, as time passes its water level would rise.
Aeolipile
(IST AD)
It is Heron's most notable invention. It is the first steam engine turbine.Sphere attached to two hollow tubes rotates as steam passes through the tubes. Steam is produced from a cauldron of boiling water below the sphere.

Nikkei sits @ new 7-year peak on a weak yenNikkei
(Traders said that the Bank…)
TOKYO: Japan's Nikkei share average rose to a more than seven-year high on Wednesday after Wall Street gained and the dollar hit a fresh seven-year high against the yen, but Otsuka Holdings tumbled on news that it will buy a U.S. drugmaker for about $3.5 billion.
The Nikkei 225 gained 1.2 per cent to 17,881.76 points by mid-morning, the highest level since July 2007.
Market observers said there are signs that Japanese shares are overheated, with the toraku ratio, or up-down ratio, rising above 142. A level above 120 signals an overbought market.
The ratio is calculated by dividing the 25-day moving average of stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section that gained by the 25-day average of those that fell.
"It is possible that the market may soon see a short-term correction," said Takuya Takahashi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities, adding that a trigger could involve macro-related reasons such as a weak overseas economic figure.
But he added that underlining sentiment remains positive, with expectations that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will win the upcoming election and push economic reforms, while the recent weakening in crude oil prices may help lift the country's consumption.
"We expect the market to see an year-end rally for the third straight year," Takahashi said.
Traders said that the Bank Of Japan's move on Tuesday to purchase 37.4 billion yen of exchange-traded funds (ETFs)lifted the mood as well.
"That (BOJ's ETF buying) gives investors comfort that the markets will be supported and the momentum continues to be up," said a senior trader at a foreign brokerage.
Exporters were stronger after the dollar rose to 119.33 yen during Asian trade, its highest level since August 2007. Panasonic Corp rose 2.3 per cent and Toyota Motor Corp
added 1.4 per cent, which was also helped by strong U.S. auto sales.
Otsuka Holdings dived as much as 5.6 per cent to a more than one-month low after saying it will buy U.S.-based Avanir Pharmaceuticals Inc for about $3.5 billion to expand its neurologic drug portfolio ahead of an expiration of a key drug patent. Investors felt the price was too high.
The broader Topix gained 0.7 per cent to 1,438.36, and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 added 0.7 per cent to 13,074.00.

30 years after  what Bhopal gas tragedy reminds usprint
Thirty years have passed, but for the residents of the jhuggies around the former Union Carbide India Ltd (UCIL) plant, that night will still be as searing in their memory. A few had unskilled jobs in the pesticide plant, but they were equally oblivious of the nature of the deadly vapour that enveloped their colonies, choking them to death and injuring thousands more in the vicinity and far beyond in Bhopal. The simple device of keeping indoors and covering mouths with a wet cloth may have saved hundreds of lives of those who fled their homes.
The repercussions of Bhopal, the world’s worst industrial disaster, have been felt throughout the globe. If one takes major incidents involving only chemical plants, it is far worse than the leakage of agrochemicals at Sandoz in Basel, Switzerland, where tonnes of pollutants entered the Rhine river in 1986, turning it red. It is worse than Seveso, near Milan in Italy, where deadly dioxin, one of the most toxic chemicals, contaminated the environment in 1976, leading to an EU directive named after it. It is worse in numbers, though arguably not in severity, than even Minamata, Japan, where a chemical plant released effluent containing mercury into the sea in the 1950s. Fish absorbed it, and in turn were consumed by humans, leading to the severest forms of disability.
Bhopal reminds us, first of all, that there is a deep-seated class divide when it comes to victims of industrial disasters. Because most of those who inhaled the poisonous gas were slum dwellers around the plant in congested ‘old’ Bhopal, they did not receive as much attention as would have better-off residents. Imagine what would happen if an Indian chemical multinational in the globalised world of today was negligent enough to release toxic fumes in a town in Europe or the US, leading to the deaths of a few thousand people.
The very fact that there is no accurate estimate of the toll speaks for itself. While the immediate official figure was 2,259, the Madhya Pradesh government estimated that 3,787 died of exposure to the gas. Others believe that 8,000 died in two weeks and a similar number later. In 2006, official estimates put the number of the injured — severely or slightly — at 550,000. In the days after December 3, hospitals were hopelessly ill-equipped to deal with patients in such huge numbers.
It reminds us that the management of all major industrial plants, including nuclear power stations, must be proactive in informing residents in their vicinity of possible accidents, and what precautions to take. In Bhopal’s immediate aftermath, a UCIL official stated that the gas was only a minor irritant to the eyes. The US parent, Union Carbide Corporation (UCC), was not forthcoming, either. There was confusion regarding what the gas was and only later did it transpire that it was methyl isocyanate (MIC), which has traces of cyanide.
The confusion was compounded by the lack of information regarding the antidote. The medical director of Union Carbide in the US cabled the Bhopal authorities to administer sodium thiosulphate to victims if cyanide poisoning was suspected, which he later denied at a press conference in Bhopal. A few days after the leak, a German toxicologist administered this chemical, but a patient died, after which he was asked to leave town. Conspiracy theorists had a field day and it is not clear till now whether this treatment only had a placebo effect. It should be incumbent on the management of any chemical, industrial or nuclear plant, whether in the private or public sector, to inform the authorities of proper antidotes for a specific hazard. The right to know Act should help elicit such information.
Bhopal also reminds us, precisely at a time when environmental laws are being streamlined and diluted, of the need to have firm regulation of such plants. There was a raging debate on whether the UCC should be tried in the US or India. There was the nationalist argument that India was well within its rights to hold the company guilty, a matter of the country’s sovereignty. On the other hand, US law on such liability was far more stringent and its courts tended to act with greater speed. After being heard in the US, where UCC offered $350 million as compensation, which the Indian government turned down, the case was shifted to India in 1986.
In Orwellian 1984, it was estimated that there were a million cases pending in Indian high courts and 140,000 in the Supreme Court. This points to the need to tighten laws, not loosen them, although there is a strong case for expediting decisions in courts. Among the environmental laws the TSR Subramanian committee has just reviewed is the Environment (Protection) Act of 1986, which was specifically legislated in the wake of Bhopal.
The tragedy reminds us of liability laws. The UCC, which held a majority of the UCIL’s shares, tried to pass the buck to the UCIL. Prior to US President Barack Obama’s visit, the government is trying to assuage the fears of foreign (largely American) suppliers — as distinct from operators — of nuclear power plants regarding their liability in an accident, as the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act of 2010 prescribes. Ironically, the BJP had joined the Left in including this penal clause, which has kept foreign firms at bay.
Finally, Bhopal reminds us of how one values lives, especially those of the poor. Infamously, it was said after 1984 that Indian lives — specifically of those casual labourers who lived around the plant — were cheaper than American lives, measured by annual earnings. In 1989, the Rajiv Gandhi regime inexplicably agreed to an out-of-court compensation of $470 million, a second major betrayal after the tragedy itself. That the victims continue to fight for their rights is a tribute to their tenacity.

Final farewell to Phillip Hughes  tearful Clarke pays haunting tribute at funeralFinal farewell to Phillip Hughes, Clarke pays poignant tribute
AFP

Cricketing greats bid an emotional farewell to Phillip Hughes at a funeral service in his home town Wednesday, as Australia stopped to remember the batsman whose death from a freak injury sent shockwaves through the sport.
A lone cricket bat rested against the coffin at a packed service in his former high school hall in Macksville on the New South Wales coast in front of his heartbroken parents, family and friends and a shattered Australian Test team.
"Taken from the game, his family and loved ones at the age of just 25, left a mark on our game that needs no embellishment," tearful captain Michael Clarke told the funeral. "I don't know about you but I keep looking for him."
Hughes, who had played 26 Tests and was on the cusp of a recall, died from bleeding on the brain last Thursday after being hit on the base of the skull by a rising ball at the Sydney Cricket Ground during a domestic match.
His tragic death stunned Australia, where cricket is considered the national game, and prompted a rescheduling of the upcoming India Test series, while fans around the world placed bats outside their front doors as a mark of respect.
Clarke said he walked to the middle of the SCG on Thursday night: "Those same blades of grass beneath my feet where he and I and so many of his mates here today have built partnerships, taken chances and lived out the dreams we painted in our heads as boys.
"I stood there at the wicket, I knelt down and touched the grass, I swear he was with me... Telling me we just needed to dig in and get through to tea," he added.
 
'We must play on'
 
Clarke said the tributes offered from sports stars and fans across the globe had sustained him, from a little girl holding a candle in tribute, to masters of the game such as Sachin Tendulkar expressing sorrow.
"This is what makes our game the greatest game in the world. We must dig in and get through to tea. And we must play on," he added.
"So rest in peace my little brother. I will see you out in the middle."
In Hughes' small hometown of Macksville, on Australia's east coast, tributes to the opening batsman hung in shop windows, while ribbons in the green and gold colours of the Australian Test team adorned telephone poles.
Macksville itself, with a population of just 2,500, welcomed greats such as Shane Warne, Brian Lara, Glenn McGrath, Virat Kohli and Hughes' first Test skipper Ricky Ponting.
Sean Abbott, the young man who bowled the fast ball which struck Hughes, also attended supported by his parents, as did Prime Minister Tony Abbott.
Tony Abbott said there had been profound grief, in part because to "be felled by a hard but fair ball in the centre of the SCG at your most exuberant, it just doesn't seem right or natural".
 
'Spirit of cricket'
Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland said over the past week the nation and the sporting world had reeled in shock.
"Yet even within that profound sense of loss the spirit of cricket has shone through the darkness," he told the gathering.
Hughes' parents Greg and Virginia and siblings invited the whole town to the service at Macksville High School, where about 1,000 crammed into the hall and hundreds more watched on screens in overflow areas.
The funeral was a huge event in Macksville, with shops closing and residents in mourning. Just outside town, one business created a huge tribute using three cherry pickers as cricket stumps and putting Hughes' Test number 408 across them.
At Hughes's old primary school, St Patrick's, dozens of bats lined the front fence, many bearing messages remembering the hugely popular opener who was not out on 63 when he was struck.
As a summer storm threatened after a hot day, hundreds walked along the street behind the hearse carrying Hughes's coffin, some nodding their heads, others applauding, out of respect for the cricketer.
Hughes died after his vertebral artery split when hit by the ball, leading to massive bleeding in his brain.

Mining to defence projects cleared near protected wildlife areasMining projects cleared near protected wildlife areas
Chetan Chauhan , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, December 03, 2014

 A government panel has cleared 130 projects, including mining pits, power plants and a defence testing site, close to protected wildlife areas.
The go-ahead was aimed at addressing industry’s concerns over stalled projects and the panel ensured that adequate safety measures were put in place, a senior ministry official told HT Tuesday.
 
“We have not stopped the projects for unnecessary reasons as it used to happen in the past,” the official said. “Precautions have been taken to ensure that there is minimal adverse impact on wildlife. All projects approved have national importance.”
 
Limestone quarrying has been allowed at five spots close to Gujarat’s Barda sanctuary — a habitat for endangered spotted eagle and crested hawk eye — in Porbandar. The mines will feed a public sector company’s unit that has come in for severe criticism for discharging affluents into a nearby water body, say the minutes of the meeting, accessed by HT.
 
The projects were approved on the condition that the unit would get a treatment plant and not discharge any pollutants in the water body, the official said.
Three limestone mines will also come up within 6 km of Mukundra Hill Tiger Reserve in Rajasthan.
 
Notified in 2013, Mukundra is the third tiger reserve in the desert state. Environmentalists had protested when mining was allowed in the state’s Sariska reserve.
A truncated National Board for Wildlife standing committee -- comprising two independent members -- met in August and in one sitting cleared all the projects, all of which will come within 10 km of protected areas. Some of the proposals were left undecided by the previous UPA government, often criticised for delaying decisions on projects and adversely hitting investment sentiment.
 
Parliament was informed about the committee’s decision Friday. HT found that only a few projects that came for approval were rejected and some deferred for want of information.
Environment minister Prakash Javadekar, who heads the panel, was not available for comments but had said earlier the ministry was following the mantra of “quick decision without any delay” based on prudent appraisals.
An intelligence bureau office will border the Dudhwa Tiger Reserve in Uttar Pradesh. In Madhya Pradesh, mining has been allowed within 10 km of Sanjay Tiger Reserve in Sidhi, Son Ghariyal Wildlife Sanctuary and Kanha National Park.
 
The committee also allowed diversion of forestland from the Kerala’s Periyar Tiger Reserve to increase the height of Kunnar Dam. In neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, a Defence Research and Development Organisation testing facility is to come up along the Bay of Bengal coast, close to a rare olive ridley turtle nesting site. The DRDO will, however, no conduct tests between January and May, when the turtles come to nest.

Minister links Muslims to crime  draws protest in ParliamentMinister links Muslims to crime, draws protest

Amid a heated debate over high number of Muslims, Dalits and Tribals as under-trials, minister of state for home affairs, Haribhai Parthibhai Chaudhary, made a controversial remark saying that data showed states where Muslim population was high, the number of undetrials from the community were also high.
“Jis state main zyada Muslim rahta hain, wahan zayda Muslim kaidi hota hain (In state where there are more Muslims, there are high Muslim under trials),” he said, while adding that there was no bias among the police against any religious group or caste. “Police is a state issue and we keep on issuing advisories to improve policing.”
Chaudhary said this while replying to a supplementary question raised by Asaduddin Owaisi of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul Muslimeen (AIMIM) asking the reason for higher proportion of Muslim, Dalits and tribals in jail as compared to their proportion in the population.
In a written reply, the minister informed that undertrials from Muslims, Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe constituted about 1.48 lakh of the total 2.78 lakh. “It is a fact that the Muslims, Dalits and adivasis constitute 38.8% of the total population of our country. But the fact also is that the Muslims, Dalits and adivasis constitute 53% as undertrials".
"These statistics reflect a serious and dangerous institutional bias among the law enforcement agencies, and the funny part is that their conviction rate is more or less the same.  This clearly shows that all these fake cases are being registered against the Muslims, Dalits and adivasis,” Owaisi said.
His statement resulted in immediate protest from the ruling party MPs who accused Owaisi of trying to give communal colour to the data provided by the home ministry and claimed that there was no bias against any community.
Owaisi did not buy the argument and said the data contradicted what Chaudhary had said.

NASA gets new countdown clock just in timeDec 03, 2014 at  10:26am IST
NASA gets new countdown clock just in time
2

Cape Canaveral: NASA has a new state-of-the-art space capsule on the launch pad and a new high-tech countdown clock to go with it.
The multimedia display was lit up and counting down the hours, minutes and seconds until Thursday morning's liftoff of Orion on an unmanned orbital test flight. It's the nation's first new spacecraft intended for true outer-space travel by humans since the Apollo moon program.
What better way to usher in this new era of exploration, NASA reasoned, than with the latest flat-screen gizmo.
NASA has a new state-of-the-art space capsule on the launch pad and a new high-tech countdown clock to go with it.
#nasa countdown clock #orion spacecraft
So last week, down came the countdown clock that dated back to the Apollo 12 moon shot in 1969 and signaled every space shuttle launch for 30 years. And up went the new display in the same exact spot at the Kennedy Space Center press site that, along with the nearby flag pole, had once earned national historic designation.
The new clock is just as long at 26 feet (almost 8 meters), but a foot taller at 7 feet (2 meters).
NASA spokesman George Diller said the old clock, while still working, had become too expensive to fix and maintain. Parts were hard to come by.
The new USD 280,000 display, similar to those used at sports stadiums, can provide multiple images in addition to the countdown time
Today the countdown numbers ticked down in the lower right corner far smaller than on the old familiar clock. But that's because the left half of the display showed a real-time, close-up image of the Delta IV rocket launch pad. In the upper right corner, the words "Orion Test Flight" showed in red, sandwiched between an Orion emblem and the NASA logo.
NASA took pains to keep the scene basically the same, with the clock and flag pole, according to Diller.
Apollo 17's launch on December 7, 1972, marked mankind's last trip to the moon and the last crewed capsule to leave Earth's immediate vicinity.
This inaugural Orion will carry no crew during the 4½-hour test flight and be confined to Earth orbit. But it will aim for a high point of 5,800 kilometers on the second loop of the planet, setting the spacecraft up for a 20,000-mph (32,200-kph), 4,000-degree re-entry. Splashdown will occur in the Pacific, 600 miles (970 kilometers) southwest of San Diego.
For this launch, a Delta IV rocket will do the heavy lifting.
Future Orions will be launched aboard NASA's still-in-development Space Launch System, or SLS, intended to carry astronauts to asteroids, Mars and beyond.
One plan calls for an asteroid to be corralled in orbit around the moon, so an Orion crew can explore the rock sometime in the 2020s. Mars expeditions would follow in the 2030s.

China s Baidu  Tencent to be fined for spreading porn: Report6
0
Beijing: China's ministry of culture said it would fine 11 Internet companies including Tencent Holdings and Baidu for spreading pornography and violence, state news agency Xinhua said on Tuesday.
China launched an anti-pornography campaign in April as part of wider efforts to "clean up" the Internet. The move has coincided with a crackdown on online freedom of expression, which has intensified since President Xi Jinping came to power early last year.
Xinhua said mobile game platforms run by Tencent, which runs one of the most popular mobile messaging apps in China, search engine giant Baidu and another nine companies were alleged to be involved in pornography, gambling and violence.

#china #porn #baidu #tencent
The report cited a statement from the culture ministry as saying that some products had challenged "accepted moral values".
Spokespeople for Tencent and Baidu did not answer calls to their mobile phones late on Tuesday in China.
Liu Qiang, a deputy director in the market department of the ministry, said the fine amounts would be published later.
"We hope that major companies can shoulder their due, social responsibilities and offer healthy, quality, cultural products," Xinhua cited Liu as saying.
The ministry also discovered comic and animated products that contained "bloody, terror and violent content" on 21 websites run by companies such as China Telecom and Tencent, Xinhua said.
In August, Chinese authorities warned Baidu to clean up its content after pornographic files were found on its online storage service.
In May, Internet firm Sina Corp. was fined 5.1 million yuan by Beijing authorities for allowing "unhealthy and indecent content" on its online reading channel and on its main website.

Twitter makes it easier for users to report abuse  harassmentDec 03, 2014 at  02:11pm IST
Twitter makes it easier for users to report abuse, harassment

New York: Twitter is trying to make it easier for victims and witnesses of online harassment to report it.
The short messaging service said Tuesday that the new tools will roll out to users over the coming weeks. It's available now for a small group of Twitter's 284 million members. Among other changes, the updates streamline the process for reporting abuse, especially on mobile devices.
Twitter says it also made "behind-the-scenes improvements" that speed up response times to reported tweets and accounts.
Twitter says it will now require less information from users flagging inappropriate content and that it will be easier to submit tweets and accounts for review.
#twitter #online harassment #social networking
Harassment and bullying on Twitter is not new. Recently, an online campaign dubbed "GamerGate" has led to the harassment of women in the video game industry for criticizing the lack of diversity and how women are portrayed in gaming.
"We are nowhere near being done making changes in this area," wrote Shreyas Doshi, director of product management and user safety, in a blog post. "In the coming months, you can expect to see additional user controls, further improvements to reporting and new enforcement procedures for abusive accounts."
That said, it is unlikely that the improvements will put an end to harassment on Twitter. While users can block accounts, and Twitter can delete them, there is nothing stopping bullies from setting up new accounts under different names.
A recent survey by the Pew Research Center found that nearly three-quarters of American adults who use the Internet have witnessed online harassment. Forty percent have experienced it themselves. The types of harassment ranged from name-calling to physical threats, sexual harassment and stalking. Half of those who were harassed said they didn't know the person who had most recently attacked them.

HSBC: Services sector growth jumps to 5-month high in NovHSBC: Services sector growth jumps to 5-month high in Nov
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Dec 3:  
Service sector activity expanded at the fastest pace in five months for the month of November after having stagnated in the prior month.
Contrasting with the overall improvement in activity, employment fell marginally and business sentiment weakened. Meanwhile, input costs and output charges declined, contrasting with the trend observed throughout the majority of the survey’s history, the HSBC India Services PMI Business Activity Index report said.
Input costs fell for the first time in more than five-and-a-half years. The rate at which input prices decreased was the second-quickest in the HSBC survey’s nine-year history, albeit moderate overall.
The Service Activity Index rose to 52.6 from October’s 50.0, with Post & Telecommunications performing the best of the broad areas monitored, while contractions in activity were registered in financial intermediation and hotels & restaurants.
The report highlighted that business activity was driven higher by faster growth of new business in November, as the respective index posted above the crucial 50.0 threshold for the seventh month in a row. Furthermore, the pace of expansion was solid overall and the quickest since July. Incoming new work also saw an increase.
Growth of activity and new business had little impact on employment in November, as workforce numbers in the Indian service sector declined for the first time in four months. That said, the rate of job shedding was slight overall. According to some panellists, staffing levels fell as a result of labour shortages, the report said.
Indian service providers registered backlog accumulation for the second consecutive month in November. However, the rate of increase eased from the previous month and was moderate overall.
Among the monitored sub-sectors, job losses were evident in renting & business activities and transport & storage.
Meanwhile, anecdotal evidence of lower fuel prices and an appreciation of the Indian rupee against the US dollar was reinforced by survey data in November, as input costs fell for the first time since March 2009.
Finally, companies operating in the Indian service sector remained optimistic regarding prospects for activity growth in November. However, despite improvements in activity and new business, sentiment slipped to the weakest since mid-2007, the report added.

US Nov auto sales pace best since 2003US Nov auto sales pace best since 2003
Reuters
Automakers sold more cars and trucks as a surging economy and falling fuel prices helped drive sales of big pickups and SUVs
Detroit, Dec 3:  
The top six automakers sold more cars and trucks in November than analysts expected, with a healthy economy, generous discounts and low fuel prices luring consumers into US showrooms.
The industry's annualised sales rate in November was about 17.1 million vehicles, the best pace for that month since 2003 and well ahead of the estimated 16.7 million in a Thomson Reuters survey of 41 industry economists and analysts.
November sales totalled 1.3 million, up 4.6 per cent from a year ago and higher than analysts' expectations of 1.27 million.
"This sustained demand for new vehicles was building for years during the recession, and it should continue unless a major shift in economic stability occurs," said analyst Karl Brauer of Kelley Blue Book.
General Motors Co, Chrysler Group, Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co all reported year-to-year sales gains in November, while Ford Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co Ltd had modest declines. All six topped forecasts from analysts surveyed by Reuters.
Early buzz and promotions tied to the post-Thanksgiving "Black Friday" retail blitz helped spur car sales, according to John Krafcik, president of online shopping service TrueCar.com. Krafcik said average transaction prices on full-size pickups in November topped $40,000 for the first time.
GM on Tuesday said November sales rose 6.5 percent to 225,818 vehicles. Sales of GM's Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra full-size pickups climbed 34 percent to 65,343.
"Lower gasoline prices are helping the entire market, not just SUVs and trucks," said GM spokesman Jim Cain, who also cited improving consumer confidence, higher wages and lower unemployment.
Chrysler Group sales rose 20.1 per cent to 170,839 vehicles on strong showings by its Jeep utility vehicles and Ram trucks. Ram pickup sales were up 21 percent, while Jeep SUV sales jumped 27 percent.
Ford reported a slight decline in sales to 186,334 vehicles, about what analysts had expected. Sales of the best-selling F-150 pickup were down 10 percent to 59,049 as the automaker began a changeover to the redesigned 2015 model.
Ford chief economist Emily Kolinski Morris said plunging fuel prices have provided a "financial windfall" for buyers, bolstered by still-low interest rates.
"By any measure, households are reaping significant disposable income gains each week at current gas prices," she said.
Toyota said sales rose 3 per cent to 183,343, while Honda reported an increase of nearly 9 per cent to 121,814. Nissan said sales were down 3 per cent to 103,188. All three companies beat analysts' expectations.

Manguluru plans memorial park for air crash victimsManguluru plans memorial park for air crash victims

Tweet
Manguluru, Dec 3:  
The Dakshina Kannada district administration has proposed the establishment of a park in memory of the victims of 2010 Mangalore air crash.
Chairing a meeting in this regard in Mangaluru on Wednesday morning, AB Ibrahim, Deputy Commissioner of the district, said that earlier it was proposed to set up a park in the premises of Mangalore International Airport.
Then some people suggested that it would be apt to set up the park at Kuloor – the place where 22 unidentified bodies of the victims were cremated – near New Mangalore Port. The site, which is in the custody of New Mangalore Port Trust, is situated between Gurpur River and national highway.
Ibrahim said that it will be a park on 44 cents of land in memory of crash victims. There will not be any permanent structure on the site.
Harinath, who represented the New Mangalore Port Trust, suggested that the district administration send a representation to the port. The Union Shipping Ministry’s approval will be required to handover the land for any such purpose.
It may be mentioned here that Air India Express flight no. 812, which was coming from Dubai, overshot the runway on landing and fell over a cliff on May 22, 2010. Following this, the aircraft caught fire.
Of the 166 people in the flight, eight survived the crash. Of the 158 bodies that were recovered in the accident, 22 remained unidentified. These unidentified bodies were later cremated at Kuloor near New Mangalore Port.

Samsung mobile chief survives reshuffle despite weak figuresMotherson Sumi to buy German firm for Rs 283 crore
Samsung Electronics defied speculation it would drop the head of its underperforming mobile division, as the Samsung Group’s heir apparent opted to keep the man his ailing father appointed while the patriarch’s future is uncertain.
Staff at Samsung have been waiting nervously for the annual reshuffle after a weak smartphone performance and the worst earnings in three years, with many fearing for their jobs, but embattled co-chief executive J.K. Shin now knows he will continue to head the Electronics unit’s mobile division despite sagging smartphone sales.
Semiconductor business chief Kwon Oh-hyun and consumer electronics head Yoon Boo-keun also kept their jobs.
Analysts said Jay Y. Lee, likely successor and only son of group patriarch Lee Kun-hee, opted to keep his father’s key lieutenants in place to ensure stability and consolidate his own position.
“With Samsung undergoing major changes in the midst of the succession process, like selling affiliates and listing units, it would have been too unsettling to change leadership,” said Chung Sun-sup, head of local research firm Chaebul.com.
“And without a signal that Chairman Lee Kun-hee has stepped back for good, it might have been too much for Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee to change the people his father put in position.”
Park Ju-gun, head of corporate watchdog CEO Score, said Lee junior likely needs more time to shore up his position in South Korea’s largest conglomerate with his father still in hospital after a heart attack in May.
“It was too soon for him to take a big risk at this point,” Park said.
Samsung Group Senior Vice President Lee June reminded reporters that Shin was “a major contributor in Samsung Electronics’ emergence as the top global player in the handsets business” and would be given an opportunity to turn the business around.
Squeezed by Chinese rivals like Xiaomi Technology Co Ltd at the low end and Apple Inc’s iPhones at the top, Samsung Electronics’ share of the smartphone market has shrunk year-on-year for the last three quarters, leading to speculation Shin’s days were numbered.
Samsung Electronics insiders said employees’ focus was now on any follow-up management appointments and reorganisation plans due for the firm later this week.

Of oil markets and conspiracy theoriesConspiracy theories spike as crude oil prices slump
Shishir Asthana | Mumbai Dec 03, 2014 11:20 AM IST
Every time the price of crude oil breaches a crucial mark, a new set of conspiracy theories hit the market. With crude oil falling below the $70 marks after OPEC decided not to cut production, more such stories are making the rounds.
The most popular one doing the rounds is that Saudi Arabia is targeting US shale oil production by preventing them from entering the market. A diagonally opposite story in the market is that the US and Saudi Arabia have teamed up to keep oil prices low in order to hit Russia and Iran, both of whom need higher oil prices to balance their budgets. The latest is that recent advances by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is forcing the Saudis to co-operate with the Americans to keep oil prices low as the terrorist organization is using oil money to fund its wars. This last theory even finds a mention in the research report of a renowned international broker.
Oil prices have always attracted story tellers in the market, especially when prices crack. In the ’80s, Saudis were blamed for conspiring with the Americans to bring down oil prices in order to spoil Russia’s adventure in Afghanistan.
Being the largest producer, Saudi Arabia generally gets blamed for any price correction, possibly because of what happened in the mid-’80s. In the first half of 1986, Saudi Arabia broke ranks with its OPEC partners and flooded the market with oil, sending prices crashing from $23.29 in December 1985 to $9.85 by July 1986.
In the present situation, it is clear that OPEC’s role and influence in the oil market has been diminished. The cartel has lost its relevance.  Even if the OPEC had decided in their recent meeting to cut oil production collectively, the impact, as the Saudis argued, would have been short-lived since there are more non-OPEC producers in the market waiting to grab market share. American companies would have happily filled the void created by OPEC. In fact, many feel that given OPEC members track record in oil production, one of their own members would have supplied the incremental oil.
The question now is how low can oil go? The general sentiment in the market is that at $70 per barrel shale oil production in the USA becomes unviable.
Canadian billionaire Murray Edwards, chairman of Canadian Nature Resource says here that prices can go down to $30-$40 per barrel but it might not stay at those levels for long. The better question, says Edward, is where does it stabilize, and that $70-$75 area is probably not a bad place to stabilize for a period of time until you get more balance in term of growth in demand and some supply response.
Moreover, $70 will not have as big an impact on USA shale oil production. The chart provided by Citigroup here shows the breakeven oil prices of every drilling project in the world. More than 80% of shale oil production in the USA can survive oil prices of around $70.
An article in Foreign Policy says that ConocoPhillips has among the lowest break-even prices in the industry at about $40 a barrel. Their higher-cost rivals can survive with oil prices in the mid-$60s range. The article goes on to say that technological advances have lowered the cost of drilling each well. Costs have fallen 50% in two years and could keep falling another 15% by 2016. At the same time, producers are now squeezing out more oil than they used to.
Even if any of the conspiracy theories is true, facts show that the oil price war is far from over. On the contrary, it has brought the OPEC and non-OPEC players to an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation. What is certain, though, is that low prices may not attract new investment in shale oil and sand oil.
A column in Business Standard points out that oil sector needs investment of $900 billion every year to meet the 2030 demand. Further, shale oil production in USA is expected to see a sharp decline from 2020 onwards. If the shale gas producers are not investing now, then they will not be able to meet future demand.
Here is one more conspiracy theory: perhaps the Saudis have convinced the OPEC nations that better times lie ahead for them.

FIR against HDIL officials by Slum Rehabilitation Authority in MaharashtraFIR against HDIL officials by Slum Rehabilitation Authority in Maharashtra
Press Trust of India | Mumbai Dec 03, 2014 10:48 AM IST
An FIR has been registered against principle secretaries of Maharashtra's housing and woman and child development departments, HDIL Group chairman and the company's ten directors in connection with alleged irregularities in Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) project in suburban Bandra, the Anti-Corruption Bureau said today.
The accused were booked following a sessions court order which directed the ACB to probe the matter brought before it by a complainant.
The FIR was filed yon Tuesday against Principle Secretary (Housing) Debashish Chakrabarty, Principal Secretary (Woman and Child Development) Ujjwal Uke, HDIL Group Chairman and the company's ten directors.
They have been charged under relevant IPC sections including 166 (public servant disobeying law, with intent to cause injury to any person), 167 (public servant framing incorrect document with intent to cause injury), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 465 (forgery), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will, etc), 471 (using as genuine a forged document or electronic record), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) and sections pertaining to the Prevention of Corruption Act.
According to ACB's Assistant Police Commissioner Rajesh Bagalkote, the complainant owned a commercial space at the Motilal Nehru Nagar in suburban Bandra.
The complainant alleged that the area had been redeveloped under SRA scheme by real estate and construction company HDIL in 2005-2006, but he was not allotted a shop after he was deliberately declared ineligible, police said.
"However, those who are ineligible were provided shops in the redeveloped area. It was also discovered that more than allotted area had been used for the redevelopment project. All these illegal activities were carried out allegedly in connivance with government officials, including Chakrabarty and Uke, who were executive officers in SRA. Various documents were allegedly forged for the purpose," Bagalkote said.
The victim approached the court following which Special Sessions Judge S V Ranpise ordered ACB to probe the complaint and take appropriate action against the persons concerned.
Following the court order, the FIR was registered  against Chakrabarty, Uke, HDIL's Wadhwan, the then additional collector in suburbs, office-bearers of Motilal Nehru Nagar Cooperative Housing Society and 10 directors of the HDIL for their alleged role in the irregularities in allotment of the space.

Indian cold storage patchily distributed: reportIndian cold storage patchily distributed: report
Viveat Susan Pinto | Mumbai Dec 03, 2014 10:32 AM IST
Almost 60% of the 6,488 cold stores in India are located in just four states—Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Gujarat and Punjab. A report from the UK-based Institution of Mechanical Engineers says it should actually be more evenly spread.
If this is not enough, almost 75%-80% of Indian refrigerated warehouses are suitable to store only potatoes, resulting in just four million or 3.84% of the 104 million tonnes of fresh produce transported in India doing so in cold storage. Naturally, the abysmal penetration of cold storage and refrigerated transport in the country results in wastage of fresh produce, which is as high as 50%, says the study.
That India needs a robust cold chain network is known, but how the current system is positioned to cater to the needs of the growing fast-food, packaged food and retail sectors is something that the study has attempted to look at.
Consider this: The 6,488 cold stores in India have a total capacity of 30 million tonnes, which is 36 million tonnes short of estimated demand. By 2020, the demand for cold storage from various user industries is expected to quadruple from current levels of about 66-70 million tonnes, says the study, to about 264-280 million tonnes.
Is India in a position to handle this kind of demand? The answer is no if the current state of affairs continues. While $15 billion worth of investment has been committed to improve cold storage facilities by the government in its 12th five-year plan, the body says that the latter will have to ensure that cold chains coming up in the future are powered by renewable resources.
"Renewable energy resources are available in abundance in India and the key to unlocking sustainable cold chains is to develop technology that can either use these directly, such as cooling through solar-driven absorption, or to power existing or new technologies through electricity generation. The Indian electricity grid is extremely inefficient, and loses 30% of its power during transmission on an average, compared to about 6% in the UK," Tim Fox, head of energy & environment, Institution of Mechanical Engineers, said.
The report says that the government will have to introduce policy initiatives that offer support to clean technologies and distributed solutions that will help make cold storage more widespread in India.

Rattled by China  India joins others to fix war machinePer capita annual income increases in national capital
India is speeding up a navy modernisation programme and leaning on its neighbours to curb Chinese submarine activity in the Indian Ocean, as nations in the region become increasingly jittery over Beijing’s growing undersea prowess.
Just months after a stand-off along the disputed border dividing India and China in the Himalayas, Chinese submarines have shown up in Sri Lanka, the island nation off India’s southern coast. China has also strengthened ties with the Maldives, the Indian Ocean archipelago.
China’s moves reflect its determination to beef up its presence in the Indian Ocean, through which four-fifths of its oil imports pass, and coincides with escalating tension in the disputed South China Sea, where Beijing’s naval superiority has rattled its neighbours.
“We should be worried the way we have run down our submarine fleet. But with China bearing down on us, the way it is on the Himalayas, the South China Sea and now the Indian Ocean, we should be even more worried,” said Arun Prakash, former chief of the Indian navy.
“Fortunately, there are signs this government has woken up to the crisis,” he said. “But it will take time to rebuild. We should hope that we don’t get into a face-off with the Chinese, that our diplomacy and alliances will keep things in check.”
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has ordered an accelerated tendering process to build six conventional diesel-electric submarines at an estimated cost of 500 billion rupees ($8.1 billion), in addition to six similar submarines that French firm DCNS is assembling in Mumbai port to replace a nearly 30-year-old fleet hit by a run of accidents.
The country’s first indigenously built nuclear submarine – loaded with nuclear-tipped missiles and headed for sea trials this month – joins the fleet in late 2016. India leased a nuclear-propelled submarine from Russia in 2012 and is in talks to lease a second one, navy officials told Reuters.
The government has already turned to industrial group Larsen & Toubro Ltd, which built the hull for the first domestic nuclear submarine, to manufacture two more, sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Elsewhere in the region, Australia is planning to buy up to 12 stealth submarines from Japan, while Vietnam plans to acquire as many as four additional Kilo-class submarines to add to its current fleet of two. Taiwan is seeking U.S. technology to build up its own submarine fleet.
Japan, locked in a dispute with China over islands claimed by both nations, is increasing its fleet of diesel-electric attack submarines to 22 from 16 over the next decade or so.
OUTNUMBERED
In addition to the leased Russian nuclear-propelled submarine, India’s navy currently has 13 ageing diesel-electric submarines, only half of which are operational at any given time due to refits. Last year, one of its submarines sank after explosions and a fire while it was docked in Mumbai.
China is estimated to have 60 conventional submarines and 10 nuclear-powered submarines, including three armed with nuclear weapons.
Ma Jiali, an expert at the China Reform Forum’s Centre for Strategic Studies which is affiliated with the Central Party School, said Beijing’s top concern in the Indian Ocean was safeguarding the passage of its commodities, especially oil.
“There are many voices in India who believe the Indian Ocean belongs solely to India, and no other country belongs there. That line of thought is common – but of course it shouldn’t be viewed like that. Our (China’s) view is that there should be dialogue and discussion between China and India.”
With India building its navy to about 150 ships, including two aircraft carriers, and China holding around 800 in its naval fleet, the two are more likely than not to run into each other, naval officials and experts say.
David Brewster, a strategic affairs visiting fellow at the Australian National University, said India will do everything it can to recover its dominant position in the Indian Ocean.
It may seek naval cooperation with Japan and Australia, and expand a military base on the Andaman Islands which lie about 140 km (87 miles) from the Malacca Straits, he said.
“India sees the presence of any Chinese naval vessel as an intrusion. There is a big ramp-up in their presence, which is clearly intended to send a message to India,” said Brewster.
India has engaged in intense diplomacy with Sri Lanka about the Chinese submarine presence, reminding it that New Delhi must be informed of such port calls under a maritime pact they signed this year along with the Maldives.
India has also muscled into an $8 billion deep water port that Bangladesh wants to develop in Sonadia in the Bay of Bengal, with the Adani Group submitting a proposal in October. China Harbour Engineering Company, an early bidder, was the front-runner.
“If China continues down this path and continues with this level of presence in the Indian Ocean then the Indians will feel they need to respond,” said Brewster.

Subrata Roy s Sahara to sell 4 properties worth Rs 2 700 crDirect equity set to top FDs as biggest asset class in FY15: Report
The Supreme Court today permitted the Subrata Roy’s Sahara Group to proceed with the sale of four domestic properties, which is likely to fetch Rs 2,710 crore, in its bid to raise Rs 10,000 crore to secure his release from jail.
The court allowed the group to sell properties in Jodhpur, Pune, Chauma in Gurgaon and Vasai in Mumbai after it was satisfied that the transactions were in accordance with its June 4 order.
This order had stated that “such sales are not for a price lower than the estimated value indicated in the statement filed before this Court or the circle rates fixed for the area in which such properties are situated”.
A bench headed by Justice T S Thakur was told that the transactions for these properties would be completed by May 2015 and in the meantime, the purchasers would deposit post-dated cheques in the name of SEBI-Sahara refund account with undertakings that those would be honoured on due dates.
The bench, also comprising justices A R Dave and A K Sikri, was informed that the group has already generated Rs 184.5 crore as part payment for its assets in Jodhpur, Chauma and Vasai and following which it was allowed to hand over three demand drafts and one cheque to SEBI’s counsel.
Regarding the sale of Pune property which would fetch Rs 550 crore, Sahara group through senior advocates Rajiv Dhawan and S Ganesh said that the agreement was not signed due to unavoidable circumstances and in the near future, the deal will be through and it is expected to get Rs 50 crore as initial part payment.
Accepting the proposal, the bench permitted it to go ahead with the proposed deal and deposit Rs 50 crore with SEBI-Sahara refund account.
Out of the list of nine domestic properties, Sahara has already sold its Ahmedabad property and has raised Rs 411.82 crores which has gone into the account of SEBI.
However, Sahara Group would have to wait for getting clearance for raising ‘junior loan’ of USD 650 million (approx. Rs 3,600 crore) as a part of the scheme to overcome the liability with Bank of China which had lent money to it in purchasing stakes in three overseas hotels, Dream Downtown and The Plaza in New York and Grosvenor House in London.
SEBI’s counsel Arvind Dattar and senior advocate Shekhar Naphade, who is assisting the court as an amicus curiae in the matter, submitted that certain terms of transactions were not clear like the issue of escrow agent and the liability which is likely to rise for the Sahara.
The bench asked the Sahara Group to provide all information sought by the amicus and the market regulator within a week and posted the matter for further hearing on December 17.
At the outset, Dhawan said substantial amout has been paid by Sahara Group to SEBI and Rs 1882 crore remains and it be allowed to give cheques for remaining dues.
“We would not like to accept post-date cheques at this stage,” the bench said.
The group also sought court’s specific direction with regard to its bid to sell the Pune property and said that some sort of confusion has been created due to some media reports.
“You have already been permitted,” the court said.
During the hearing, the court expressed dissatisfaction over the progress in the sale of properties and suggested that it can also assist in their disposal by taking help of an assets management company.
Earlier, Sahara Group had approached the court with a fresh proposal for securing release of Subrato Roy.
Roy, who was sent to jail on March 4 this year for non- refund of over Rs 20,000 crore with interest to depositors, was asked by the court to pay Rs 10,000 crore to get bail, out of which Rs 5,000 crore should be paid in cash and rest of the amount in bank guarantee.
Sahara, which earlier had raised Rs 3,117 crore and deposited with SEBI, has told the court that out of nine domestic assets it has now sold an Ahmedabad property and raised Rs 411.82 crores which has also gone into account of the market regulator.
Earlier, SEBI had moved the court seeking its direction to Sahara group to give a time schedule for payment of Rs 47,000 crore to it.
In the application, SEBI had submitted that the group be directed to furnish all details before the court regarding offers it received for its three luxury hotels, which was to be put on sale to raise money to be deposited with it.
The apex court had earlier allowed Roy, 65, to use the conference room in Tihar jail complex to hold negotiations with potential buyers for selling the hotels in New York and London.
Court lets India’s Sahara sell $424 mln of local properties
(Reuters) India’s Sahara conglomerate on Tuesday won the Supreme Court’s approval to sell four of its domestic properties, which it said would raise 26.22 billion rupees ($424 million), crucial to secure the bail of its jailed chief.
Sahara Chairman Subrata Roy has been held in a New Delhi jail for almost nine months in a long-running dispute with the country’s capital markets regulator over the refund of billions of dollars the group raised in outlawed bonds.
The Supreme Court has asked Sahara to deposit 100 billion rupees initially to release Roy on bail. Sahara has said it would mortgage or sell its overseas hotels, including the Plaza in New York and Grosvenor House in London, to raise funds.
Last week, Sahara sought the court’s approval to take over a Bank of China loan on the overseas hotels and also raise $650 million more in loans through a refinancing to pay off the bail money.
The court has sought more information from the capital markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, and Sahara on the refinancing of the overseas properties and will hear the case next on Dec. 17.

Flipkarts Bansals continue funding spree  invest $1 m in start-upAtherBengaluru |
Posted: December 3, 2014 11:50 am
Flipkart co-founders Sachin and Binny Bansal have invested $1 million in Ather, a start-up focused on designing high-speed electric two-wheelers, in their third investment since June. Serial entrepreneur and Medall Healthcare CEO Raju Venkatraman also participated in this round.
Incubated at the IIT Madras, Ather was launched in 2013 by Tarun Mehta and Swapnil Jain.
According to Mehta, the fresh funds will be used for research and development of components like battery, charger and android dashboard.
While the company has already built prototypes of the vehicle, it will take another four months to offer test rides to the public. A full-fledged sale will commence in 12-14 months.
“Sachin and Binny Bansal’s focus on technology and reinvention aligns with that of the Team Ather. Electric vehicles are still at a very nascent stage in India and our aim is to develop and introduce efficient electric scooters which will benefit the country and help manage its resources more effectively,” Mehta said.
Ather raised their first round of capital, $100,000, in February this year from Aerospike founder V Srinivas and the Technology Development Board, government of India.
Incidentally, the Flipkart co-founders have been on an investment spree ever since the Flipkart’s acquisition of Myntra in May.
In June, Bansals, along with Saif Partners and other angel investors, participated in a $700,000 funding round for Touchtalent, a social networking site and platform for artists to sell their work.
A few weeks later, Binny Bansal invested in fashion-focused social network Roposo.
Bansals again invested in News in Shorts, which provides news in 60 words, in July. This was followed by an another investment in offline games start-up MadRat Games in November.
“We believe that the world is moving towards a smarter, more energy-efficient and environment-friendly approach in our daily lives. Growing Indian start-ups like Ather are using technology successfully to make a mark in this field,” Sachin and Binny Bansal said in a statement.
Incidentally, Bansals are not the only Indian e-commerce entrepreneurs to have turned angel investors. Snapdeal’s Kunal Bahl has also invested in Delhi-based online chat platform Zumbl and taxi services company Ola, which recently raised a staggering $210 million from Japan’s SoftBank.

Jaguar Land Rover concludes pay and pensions deal with workersunionJLR and Unite have concluded detailed pay and conditions negotiations, a revised offer has been made by the company that will be unanimously recommended by Unite to its members. (Reuters)

Posted: December 3, 2014 11:47 am
Tata Motors-owned Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has concluded a deal over pay and pensions with its workers union after revising its offer, which will now be recommended to staff to settle a dispute that had threatened industrial action.
In a joint statement, the the two parties said: “JLR and Unite have concluded detailed pay and conditions negotiations, a revised offer has been made by the company that will be unanimously recommended by Unite to its members.”
The pay offer includes recognition of JLR’s recent performance for employees and agreements on working practices with Unite that ensures that the company can meet its business plan commitments, it added.
“The headlines of the offer are – 4.5 per cent pay increase with a lump sum performance recognition payment of 825 per employee in year one of a two-year deal, RPI + 0.5 per cent or 3 per cent, whichever is greater, in the second year,” it said.
However, there are no pension proposals in this pay deal, it added.
Pay talks at the company had failed in October and last month, workers union had rejected an offer by the car maker over pay and pension changes, while asking the management to either re-negotiate the proposal, or face vote for industrial action.
According to Unite, the UK’s largest trade union, 96 per cent of JLR workers across the company’s five plants had rejected the pay deal.

Justin Bieber dating HaileyBaldwinBy: Press Trust of India | London |

Justin Bieber is reportedly getting close to Alec Baldwin’s niece Hailey. The ‘Boyfriend’ hitmaker is said to be growing close to Hailey in the wake of his split from on-and-off girlfriend Selena Gomez, reported Hollywood Life.
“Justin has a new muse and it’s Hailey. She’s different from the other girls Justin has been with. She’s really fun, feisty, and could care less about Justin’s fame and fortune,” a source said.
The 20-year-old singer apparently treated Hailey to an extravagant shopping trip to celebrate her recent birthday. “Hailey’s birthday was on November 22 so when she got to New York, Justin made sure to spoil her and treat her like a princess. He totally took care of her and took her shopping. He’s definitely on the rebound from Selena,” the source added.

Want a better deal Try monkey as your shoppingpartnerBy: Indo-Asian News Service | New York |
Posted: December 3, 2014 11:44 am
 
Monkeys are smarter than humans when it comes to shopping as they do not confuse the price tag of a good with its quality, an interesting study from Yale University shows.
Senior Study author Laurie Santos, psychologist at Yale University and Rhia Catapano, former Yale undergraduate, designed a series of four experiments to test whether capuchin monkeys would prefer higher-priced but equivalent items.
They taught monkeys to make choices in an experimental market and to buy novel foods at different prices.
The results showed that monkeys understood the differences in price between the foods.
“But when we tested whether monkeys preferred the taste of the higher-priced goods, we were surprised to find that the monkeys did not show the same bias as humans,” researchers observed.
“Our previous work has shown that monkeys are loss-averse, irrational when it comes to dealing with risk and even prone to rationalising their own decisions, just like humans,” Santos said.
“But this is one of the first domains we have tested in which monkeys show more rational behaviour than humans do,” he added.
Previous research showed that people think a wine labeled with an expensive price tag tastes better than the same wine labeled with a cheaper price tag.
In other studies, people thought a painkiller worked better when they paid a higher price for it.
The new study shows that monkeys do not buy that premise although they share other irrational behaviours with their human relatives.
For humans, higher price tags often signal that other people like a particular good.
“Our richer social experiences with markets might be the very thing that leads us – and not monkeys – astray in this case,” Santos concluded.
The study appeared in the journal Frontiers in Psychology

Ashton Carter to be Obamas likely pick for new US DefenceSecyBy: Associated Press | Washington |
Posted: December 3, 2014 11:41 am
Former Pentagon official Ashton Carter is likely to be President Barack Obama’s nominee for defense secretary, according to administration officials, putting him in line to take over a sprawling department that has had an uneasy relationship with the White House.
Officials said Obama had not made a final decision on the matter, but Carter had emerged as the top candidate. At the White House, spokesman Josh Earnest praised Carter effusively for serving “very, very ably” at the Pentagon previously and noted Carter had been easily confirmed by the Senate once before.
“This is an indication that he fulfills some of the criteria that we’ve discussed in the past,” Earnest said. “He is somebody who definitely deserves and has demonstrated strong bipartisan support for his previous service in government.”
A physicist with deep Pentagon experience, Carter moved to the top of the White House’s short list after several leading contenders pulled their names from consideration for what is typically a highly sought-after Cabinet spot.
Sen. Jim Inhofe, the Senate Armed Services Committee’s top Republican, said he was informed of the decision to name Carter early Tuesday and backs Carter’s expected nomination. An aide of Inhofe said later the senator had based his comments on press reports.
“I support it very strongly,” Inhofe said of Carter’s probable nomination. “I’m very pleased he is going to be our secretary of defense. I can’t imagine that he’s going to have opposition to his confirmation.”
Administration officials said Obama did not plan to announce his Pentagon pick Tuesday and could still go in a different direction. The officials insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the president’s decision-making process publicly.
If Obama moves forward with Carter’s nomination and he is approved by the Senate, the 60-year-old would replace Chuck Hagel, who resigned as Pentagon chief last week under pressure from Obama.
Hagel’s resignation highlighted ongoing tensions between the White House and the Pentagon, where top officials have complained about West Wing micromanagement and a lack of clarity in Obama’s policy-making. Perhaps as a result of those concerns, Obama found himself with a far shorter list of possible replacements for Hagel that the White House may have expected.
Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson was among those considered for the Pentagon post, but told the White House he’d rather stay put, according to people familiar with the process. Michele Flournoy, one of Obama’s top choices, quickly took her name out of contention, in part because of concerns over the tight rein the White House has tried to keep on the Defense Department. And Sen. Jack Reed, a Democrat and a veteran, also made clear within hours of Hagel’s resignation continued…

Services PMI jumps to 5 month-high in Nov: HSBCBank of India
(The HSBC Services PMI, rose…)
NEW DELHI: Faster growth in fresh orders spurred India's services sector, the largest contributor to the economy, to a fivemonth high in November while business sentiment slipped to the weakest level in nearly seven years, according to a private survey released on Wednesday.
The HSBC's purchasing managers' index for services accelerated to 52.6 points in November, compared to stagnation in the previous month. A reading above 50 on this survey-based index indicates expansion while below that underlines contraction.
"Service sector activity grew in November, as new business rose for the seventh month running," said Pranjul Bhandari, HSBC's chief Indian economist.
Business sentiment, however, slipped to the weakest level since mid-2007, according to the report based on a survey of 350 private firms.
"Despite the uptick in order flows, business sentiment deteriorated, reminding us that continued policy action that addresses investor concerns is needed to sustain growth momentum," said Bhandari.
The official GDP data released last week for the quarter to September showed slight improvement in the services sector, which grew 6.8% compared to 6.1% in the year-ago period.
Overall GDP growth during the quarter was 5.3%, slower than 5.7% in the previous threemonth period.
As per the survey, the headline HSBC Composite Output Index, which takes both services and manufacturing into account, rose to a five-month high of 53.6 points from 51 in the previous month.Post and telecommunications was the best performing among the broad areas monitored while contractions in activity were registered in financial intermediation, and hotels and restaurants, the report said.

Sensex will be above 32 600 in 2015 for sure  India s success story on  says Goldman SachsGoldman Sachs overweight on Indian markets; see 15% upside in 2015

(Goldman Sachs joins the…)
NEW DELHI: Goldman Sachs has joined the bandwagon of other investment banks such as Citigroup and Morgan Stanley , which have reiterated their positive outlook for the Indian markets, and see over 15 per cent upside in the year 2015.
"Do we see this year's (2014) success story to continue in 2015? We think the answer is yes. We do not think it is going to go up 30 per cent like it did this year, but it could go up by 15 per cent sure," says Timothy Moe , Chief Asia Pacific Strategist, Goldman Sachs.
"There is a perfectly reasonable expectation driven by the fact we think earnings growth for both 2015 and 2016 will be strong. And, for India we think there will be cyclical recovery from a depressed level," he adds.
The global investment bank is overweight on Taiwan, China, India and Indonesia.
Even though several brokerages have downgraded corporate earnings for FY15 and FY16, leading market intermediaries like Citi, Morgan Stanley, UBS and Ambit Capital have said they expect the benchmark index, BSE Sensex , to touch the levels between 32,500 and 36,000 by December 2015, ET reported.
Moe thinks that India has the potential to record around 7 per cent growth rate probably in the next year, which looks very promising when compared with other emerging market economies.
To give an example, India is up over 30 per cent in US dollar terms and Korea is down over 10 per cent. So there is a wide disparity between the markets and the sectors.
"We are looking for growth to accelerate 5.6 per cent and then to 6.3 per cent in the next two years. So this is something which is probably one of the better cyclical recovery stories in the region," adds Moe.
MSCI Asia Pacific ex-Japan index was up about 3 per cent for the year - not a very good year overall. If we go deeper, we see a lot of disparity. There is a 40 percentage point difference between the best and the worst performing markets, explains Moe.
Commenting on the overall rate structure, Moe says the overall backdrop for the monetary environment will still be very accommodative and, therefore, very supportive of asset markets.
"However, it might change a bit as we are expecting the US to finally begin to raise its former policy rate in the third quarter of next year, specifically on September 17thwhen the FOMC meeting for that month lies," adds Moe.
He says that when the US Fed starts hiking rates, it will be a moderate 25 bps increment. "So we do not think this will be a major shock and should not be something the financial markets will be unduly concerned by," he adds.

Construction delay puts jail security at riskUpdated: December 3, 2014 11:48 IST
Construction delay puts jail security at risk
S. Sundar
A view of Madurai Central Prison
No work has been done in the last seven months
MADURAI The inordinate delay in construction of an administrative block at Madurai Central Prison has put security at the jail, which houses around 1,300 prisoners, at risk.
The work for the ground-plus-one-storey building, planned at a cost of Rs. 84.88 lakh, began in June 2013. Though the structure was completed in May 2014, other works on it are yet to resume for want of funds.
The ostensible reason cited for the stoppage of work for seven long months is escalation of cost of the project, for which the Public Works Department (PWD) has sought an additional sanction of Rs. 24.40 lakh from the government.
However, a jail source revealed that PWD engineers turned “indifferent” ever since the State government decided to entrust all construction works related to the Prisons Department to the Tamil Nadu Police Housing Corporation.
The order approving the Tamil Nadu Police Housing Corporation as its executive agency was issued in September 2013, and the work stopped in May 2014. “The PWD was expected to complete the work by December 2014. But, the work has been stalled for seven months now,” the source added.
The source said the contractor was willing to complete the work and claim the bills later provided the PWD officials gave him permission. But, nothing had worked so far, the source added.
The building was planned to accommodate the offices of the Jail Superintendent, Jailor, a control room and all other administrative sections. The most important aspect of the building is the security of the jail. “Ever since the construction work started, we closed the main entrance and are using the rear way to handle the prisoners. It is not only circuitous, but also very risky,” the source added.
Besides, the important sections of the administrative buildings were now accommodated at five different locations, making it difficult for the staff.
Deputy Inspector General of Police (Prisons) V.H. Mohammed Haneefa said cost escalation had delayed the work. “I have asked top PWD officials to expedite the works,” he added.
Jail security had been increased by re-deploying around 10 men from sub-jails situated at other places, he added.

Our Bureau
Tweet
Kolkata, Dec 3:  
National Mineral Development Corporation Ltd (NMDC) has decided to scale up its production of iron ore gradually and aims to double output by 2018-19.
Narendra Kothari, CMD of NMDC, said the miner has set a production target of 31 million tonnes (mt) of iron ore and sales of 32 mt in 2014-15. In 2013-14, it produced 30 mt of iron ore.
“By 2018-19 we expect to reach a target of 60 mt and by 2024-25 NMDC targets to touch 100 mt of iron ore,” he added.
These are revised production targets for NMDC. Earlier, the public sector miner had set an output target of 50 mt by 2014-15.
New mining areas
It plans to enhance production capabilities at its mines and also open up new mines such as Deposit-11B in the Bailadila sector of Chhattisgarh and Kumaraswamy in Donimalai sector of Karnataka.
Kothari said NMDC was preparing action plans for its Jharkhand assets. Through a joint venture with the Jharkhand State Mineral Development Corporation, NMDC is pursuing the projects at Sasangada and Ghatkuri in West Singhbhum Distict of Jharkhand. A meeting of prospective equipment suppliers has been organised in January, he added.
He said NMDC’s three-million-tonne-a-year proposed steel plant at Jagdalpur should be ready by December 2015.
Kothari said NMDC was targeting exploration of potash in Russia. The CMD also said the Government has allowed the national miner to undertake joint exploration in the unexplored areas of the country.

Prabhu: Railways will seek pvt funds  but it does not signal privatisationThe Hindu Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu (file photo)
Mumbai, Dec 3:  
The Railways will seek private capital for investment but this does not mean that the organisation will be privatised, Union Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu said at a conference in Mumbai this morning.
Speaking over a video link, Prabhu said, “The Railways need to become a vibrant, sustainable and efficient business organisation” and private capital is necessary to achieve this. However, it will take into consideration the needs of all stakeholders, particularly its employees.
“The Railways’ finances have been neglected; we are committed to promises that we cannot fulfil. We are overcharging freight traffic while not charging enough from passenger traffic. There is very little internal (revenue) accruals. So to improve the Railways, private investment is necessary.”
Prabhu was unwilling to give details on the scope and modes of private financing but said he would make a policy statement in Parliament and a complete blueprint on turning the Railways around in the coming months.
His priorities are passenger amenities, including improving the quality of food served on trains by setting up base kitchens and better maintenance of toilets, and efficient ticket booking facilities. He said plans are also on to build new coach factories and to connect strategic areas such as Jammu and Kashmir and the North-East by rail to the rest of the country. “But the bottomline is as important as customer satisfaction,” Prabhu said.

Bandra slum project: Govt officials  HDIL Chairman booked for irregularitiesHDIL Group chairman, Rakesh Kumar Wadhwan
Mumbai, Dec 3:  
An FIR has been registered against principal secretaries of Maharashtra’s housing and woman and child development departments, HDIL Group chairman and the company’s ten directors in connection with alleged irregularities in Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) project in suburban Bandra, the Anti-Corruption Bureau said on Wednesday.
The accused were booked following a sessions court order which directed the ACB to probe the matter brought before it by a complainant.
The FIR was filed yesterday against Principal Secretary (Housing) Debashish Chakrabarty, Principal Secretary (Woman and Child Development) Ujjwal Uke, HDIL Group Chairman and the company’s 10 directors.
The HDIL stock was trading down 2.22 per cent or Rs 1.80 at Rs 79.35 on the BSE in late morning trade.
They have been charged under relevant IPC sections including 166 (public servant disobeying law, with intent to cause injury to any person), 167 (public servant framing incorrect document with intent to cause injury), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 465 (forgery), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will, etc), 471 (using as genuine a forged document or electronic record), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) and sections pertaining to the Prevention of Corruption Act.
According to ACB’s Assistant Police Commissioner Rajesh Bagalkote, the complainant owned a commercial space at the Motilal Nehru Nagar in suburban Bandra.
The complainant alleged that the area had been redeveloped under the SRA scheme by real estate and construction company HDIL in 2005-2006, but he was not allotted a shop after he was deliberately declared ineligible, police said.
“However, those who are ineligible were provided shops in the redeveloped area. It was also discovered that more than allotted area had been used for the redevelopment project. All these illegal activities were carried out allegedly in connivance with government officials, including Chakrabarty and Uke, who were executive officers in SRA. Various documents were allegedly forged for the purpose,” Bagalkote said.
The victim approached the court following which Special Sessions Judge SV Ranpise ordered ACB to probe the complaint and take appropriate action against the persons concerned.
Following the court order, the FIR was registered yesterday against Chakrabarty, Uke, HDIL’s Wadhwan, the then additional collector in suburbs, office-bearers of Motilal Nehru Nagar Cooperative Housing Society and 10 directors of the HDIL for their alleged role in the irregularities in allotment of the space.

Citi leads India s M&A league tables in 2014Citi leads India's M&A league tables in 2014
BS Reporter | Mumbai Dec 04, 2014 12:47 AM IST
 
Citibank has topped the league table for 2014 by advising merger and  acquisition (M&A) deals worth $8.2 billion. It is followed by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, according to Dealogic statistics for the 11 months of 2014.
Two investment banking outfits, Evercore Partners, which advised Sun Pharma along with Citibank, and GCA Savvian Advisors, which advised Japanese drug major Daichi, have made it to the top 10 list thanks to the Sun-Ranbaxy deal. Transactions were expected to slow down in December due to year-end holidays, bankers said.
Sun Pharma’s blockbuster acquisition of Ranbaxy for $3.9 billion was the biggest M&A transaction for the current year while mobile phone spectrum acquisitions by Vodafone, Bharti Airtel, Reliance Communications and Idea Cellular were among the top 10 transactions of the year. Sun Pharma’s acquisition of Ranbaxy is awaiting approval by the Competition Commission of India.

Bankers gave credit to improved business sentiment in India after Narendra Modi took over as Prime Minister. “The investment climate has certainly improved and private investors are keen to invest here. India is a growth capital market and the investment rate is linked to capital expenditure on the ground. It is important to note that a lot of capacity was lying idle for the past two or three years when the economy slowed down and capacity expansion will take place only when capacity utilisation improves. We expect things to improve from here,” said J M Trivedi, head of Actis in India.
The completion of the United Spirits transaction by Diageo announced in 2012 also made it to the top five M&A deals of the year. Many assets were sold this year by highly leveraged like the Jaypee group, which sold its two hydro companies in Himachal Pradesh to JSW for $1.58 billion.
The massive valuation of e-commerce companies like Flipkart was another big theme of the year with the online retailer company selling its shares to a clutch of private equity companies, including Tiger Global and Naspers, in July for close to $1 billion (Rs 6,200 crore). The investments by the private equity companies provided a valuation of $7 billion to Flipkart even as rival Amazon decided to invest another $2 billion in its India operations in September.
Bankers say this year the Adani group emerged one of the top buyers by buying Dhamra Port from Larsen & Toubro and the Tatas for close to Rs 5,500 crore and two power projects from the Lanco and Avantha groups. Adani bought Lanco’s Udupi power project for Rs 6,000 crore and Avantha’s Korba power project for close to Rs 4,200 crore.
On the outlook for the next year, bankers said many groups with big debts like Jaypee, Lanco and Leela Hotels would continue to sell assets either to better leveraged companies or to private equity firms.

LPG cyclinder price cut by 113 as crude prices fallComments
Price of non-subsidised cooking gas (LPG) was on Monday cut by a steep Rs. 113 per cylinder and that of jet fuel (ATF) by 4.1% as international oil rates slumped to multi-year lows.
A 14.2-kg cylinder of non-subsidised LPG will now cost Rs. 752, down from Rs. 865 previously, in Delhi, oil companies announced on Monday.
This is the fifth straight reduction in rates of non-subsidised or market priced LPG, which the customers buy after exhausting their quota of 12 cylinders at subsidised rates, since August.
In five monthly reduction, non-domestic LPG rates have been slashed by Rs. 170.5 per cylinder, bringing the price at three-year lows.
On similar lines, the price of aviation turbine fuel (ATF), or jet fuel, at Delhi was cut by Rs. 2,594.93 per kilolitre, or 4.1%, to Rs. 59,943 per kilolitre (kl).
This is the fifth straight monthly reduction in rates. This reduction follows a steep 7.3% or Rs. 4,987.7 per kl, cut in prices on November 1.
Since August, ATF prices have been cut by 14.5% or Rs. 10,218.76 per kl and rates have dipped below Rs. 60,000 per kl level for the first time in three years.
Brent, the benchmark grade for more than half of the world's oil, have dropped to $68.34 a barrel, the lowest level since October 2009.
Prices declined 18% last month and are 38% lower in 2014. In Mumbai, jet fuel will cost Rs. 61,695 per kl from Monday as against Rs. 64,414.98 per kl previously. The rates vary because of differences in local sales tax or VAT.

Samsung to sell fibre optics business to focus more on smartphonesBy: Reuters | Seoul |
Posted: December 2, 2014 7:56 pm
Samsung is exiting another non-core business to focus on shoring up underperforming key areas like smartphones.
Samsung Electronics Co Ltd agreed to sell its fibre optics operations to U.S. specialty glass maker Corning Inc, exiting another non-core business to focus on shoring up underperforming key areas like smartphones.
Terms of the sale, including plants in China and South Korea, weren’t disclosed. Announced by both parties on Tuesday, the South Korean firm’s second exit from a business line this quarter comes as it braces for its lowest annual profit in three years, squeezed by stiff competition.
The world’s top maker of smartphones has been caught between Chinese rivals like Xiaomi Technology Co Ltd at the low end and Apple Inc’s iPhones at the top. Samsung Electronics’ share of the global smartphone industry has shrunk year-on-year for the last three quarters.
“We have decided to sell our fibre optics business, in order to focus on our core business areas,” a Samsung Electronics spokeswoman said. The company declined to comment on how much revenue the division generates.
The firm also said in October it will halt its light emitting diode lighting business outside of its home country, which was also considered a non-core business.
Corning, which supplies glass for Samsung and Apple Inc smartphones, said the deal will strengthen its fibre optics business in the Asian market.

Sahara Allowed to Sell Properties Worth Rs 2,700 Crore
Press Trust of India | Updated On: December 02, 2014 19:23 (IST)
SpiceJet Cancellations Trigger Chaos At Airports
The Supreme Court on Tuesday permitted the Sahara Group to proceed with the sale of four domestic properties in its bid to raise Rs 10,000 crore for the release of its jailed chief Subrata Roy. The property sale is likely to fetch Rs 2,710 crore.
The top court allowed the group to sell properties in Jodhpur, Pune, Chauma in Gurgaon and Vasai in Mumbai after it was satisfied that the transactions were in accordance with its June 4 order.
This order had stated that "such sales are not for a price lower than the estimated value indicated in the statement filed before the court or the circle rates fixed for the area in which such properties are situated".
A bench headed by Justice TS Thakur was told that the transactions for these properties would be completed by May 2015 and meanwhile, the purchasers would deposit post-dated cheques in the name of Sebi-Sahara refund account with undertakings that those would be honoured on due dates.
The bench, also comprising justices AR Dave and AK Sikri, was informed that the group has already generated Rs 184.5 crore as part payment for its assets in Jodhpur, Chauma and Vasai.
Regarding the sale of Pune property which would fetch Rs 550 crore, Sahara Group said that the agreement was not signed due to unavoidable circumstances and in the near future, the deal will be through and it is expected to get Rs 50 crore as initial part-payment.
Accepting the proposal, the bench permitted it to go ahead with the proposed deal and deposit Rs 50 crore with Sebi-Sahara refund account.
Out of the list of nine domestic properties, Sahara has already sold its Ahmedabad property and has raised Rs 411.82 crore which has gone into the account of market regulator Sebi.
However, Sahara Group would have to wait for getting clearance for raising $650 million (about Rs 4,000 crore at $1 = Rs 61) as a part of a scheme to overcome the liability with Bank of China which had lent money to it in purchasing stakes in three overseas hotels, Dream Downtown and The Plaza in New York and Grosvenor House in London.
Sebi's counsel Arvind Dattar and senior advocate Shekhar Naphade, who is assisting the court as an amicus curiae in the matter, submitted that certain terms of transactions were not clear.
The bench asked the Sahara group to provide all information sought by the amicus curiae and the market regulator within a week and posted the matter for further hearing on December 17.

Book Minister: Congress  CPI(M)parliament
We request members to consider matter settled, says Rudy
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday obliquely disapproved of the controversial remarks made by Union Minister of State for Food Processing Industries Niranjan Jyoti at a public meeting and asked party members to refrain from making comments that were “unacceptable.”
Addressing the BJP Parliamentary Party meeting, Mr. Modi asked members to be careful about their “achaar aur vichaar” (demeanour). Without naming anyone, he advised MPs to be cautious about their utterances in the media as well. Later, Parliamentary Affairs Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu conveyed to the Minister to express regret in Parliament, which she did.
An embarrassed BJP said that it was a “sad incident” and the remarks were “very regretful”. “There is no place for such remarks in politics,” Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Rajeev Pratap Rudy said at a press conference.
He, however, added that while members in the Lok Sabha had taken a call and accepted Ms. Jyoti’s “regret”, Rajya Sabha members had not. “There cannot be two versions of the same issue. We request members to consider the matter settled.”
To the Chair’s observation in the Rajya Sabha that there was no evidence to warrant issuing a direction to the government, CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury said her apology and withdrawal of statement was an admission of guilt. Later, briefing mediapersons, the Congress and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) refused to repeat what she said, to drive home the point that it was “unmentionable.” Questioning the otherwise “voluble’’ Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s silence, Congress spokesman and Rajya Sabha member Abhishek Singhvi said, “To simply walk into Parliament and withdraw a statement does not erase culpability.”
Both parties said she should be booked under Section 153 (a) of the Indian Penal Code. Mr. Singhvi wondered why such efforts to create communal tension happened with “monotonous regularity” before every election.
“Whenever there is an assault on the idea of India, Mr. Modi is silent. What message is he sending with his silence — that the police can lie low and look the other way,” he said.

Aftershocks of Delhi s Trilokpuri riots felt in classroomsComments
The faultlines of the Trilokpuri riots have reached the classroom.
A little more than a month after riots broke out in this part of east Delhi, at least two reports in the last three days of brawls involving school students have deepened the polarisation. At least 70 were injured and more than 70 arrested in the riots that raged for three days in October.
In one case, two victims in their police complaint said they were asked about their religion before being beaten up by fellow students. After the violence, the police headquarters on Tuesday sent Rapid Action Force personnel to guard the government school in Block 27. The police also met the school principal and asked him to keep a sharp eye on mischief-makers.
In another case, locals alleged some boys in a Mayur Vihar Phase I government school smeared the face of a fellow student with meat, ridiculing him over his religion.
The police, however, denied such an incident happened.
The violence at the Block 27 school started Saturday afternoon. A 14-year-old, Class 9 student was allegedly thrashed by seniors outside the school. The victim in his police complaint alleged the group asked him whether he was Muslim or Hindu.
 
“When I told them, the blows started. I managed to flee and reach home. At least 30 students thrashed me. Some locals present at the spot rescued me from them,” he alleged.
The victim lodged a police complaint but no FIR has been registered. His father, Mohammed Kilabuddin, told HT, “The other boys were also there. The police told us they are kids and it was a normal fight between them and my son. Those who are brainwashing these students should be punished severely.”
Kalibudin alleged that on Monday, he asked his 17-year-old elder son to drop his younger son to school.
 
“At around 1pm, the two had reached the school gate when the same boys hurled abuses and blows on him. My sons told me there were at least 20 boys. My elder son has sustained head injuries but police asked us to compromise,” he said. “Later, a local leader brought some of those boys to the police station. They said it was a two-way fight and they could also press charges. I have not heard from the police since then.”
A senior police officer who refused to be quoted said there was no communal angle in the two reported brawls. “It was a normal brawl between students. Moreover, all involved are minors so we did not register a case. We have warned the principal and teachers and asked them to ensure students do not take advantage of the recent riots,” the officer said.

Government would bring in necessary changes in liquor policy: OommenChandyWritten by Shaju Philip | Thiruvananthapuram |
Posted: December 3, 2014 2:45 pm | Updated: December 3, 2014 3:57 pm
Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy on Wednesday told the Assembly that the government would bring in necessary changes in the new liquor policy .
Climbing down from his earlier adamant stand there wouldn’t be a review of the new liquor policy, Chandy said the policy would be altered factoring in practical and legal aspects.
The new liquor policy of the Congress government, which envisaged immediate closure of all bar hotels below the five-star category and total prohibition in a decade, had faced setback in the courts. Besides, the bar hotel owners allegation that finance minister K M Mani had accepted bribe for renewing the licence has put the government on the defensive.
After the bar hotel owners petitioned the high court against the closure of the bars, the court had allowed them to function until appeals in the issue were disposed. In another verdict, all four and heritage category hotels got a relief from the court. Taking a cue from that verdict in October, 22 new four-star hotels obtained a verdict on Tuesday to the effect they are given liquor licence.
Stakeholders in the tourism and hotel industry had warned the government that the new liquor policy would hit the state’s tourism industry, which is worth Rs 22,000 crores annually.
However, Congress state president V M Sudheeran, who is on a political tour which has liquor-free Kerala as one of the highlights, said there was no need for changing the liquor policy. Sudheeran told the media that he could not understand under what circumstances Chandy had informed the assembly that the policy would be watered down.
For the third consecutive day, the issue of liquor licence to bar hotels dominated the discussions in the state assembly. The Opposition alleged that the high court verdict to sanction liquor licence to 22 four-star hotels showed the government’s secret. deal with the bar hotel owners. It said the government was helping the hotel owners by delaying the appeal against the single bench’s verdict.

It was my dream to work with dad: ArjunKapoorBy: Press Trust of India | Mumbai |
Posted: December 3, 2014 2:36 pm
Arjun Kapoor’s childhood dream of working with producer father Boney Kapoor has come true with upcoming action-comedy ‘Tevar’, where the father-son duo has collaborated.
Arjun, who is the son of Boney and his previous wife Mona Shourie Kapoor, said it was a nice moment to work in the film which also stars his uncle Sanjay Kapoor. “It’s not yet sunk in that I have worked for a home production. It has always been a dream working with dad, Sanjay (Kapoor) chachu and Anil (Kapoor) chachu. And that happened in my fifth film. There are more emotions attached at the personal level than at the professional front,” Arjun told PTI in an interview.
The 29-year-old ‘Finding Fanny’ star he waited for a long time to work with his father. “I am emotional by nature. I waited for this opportunity for 29 years… And it’s not an easy job to be accepted as an actor. Obviously, he has a sense of pride and that reflects in our emotions and that I guess will happen quite often,” he said. Arjun recalled how he used to accompany his father on his grand sets. “I always thought that my father is the biggest producer in this world. His films sets used to be so big that I used to get lost in it. During the shooting of ‘Loafer’ there was a huge set at Ramoji film city and similarly during ‘Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja’, the set was for 150 junior artists and 200 actors,” he said.
The actor said his father always taught him to work hard to get success. “I learnt from dad that hard work never fails. He always asked me to work hard to survive in the industry. He is always encouraging. One thing which I like about him is he is not interfering even as a father or as a producer.
“Whatever wrong or right decisions I have made he always supported me. He has given me that much respect and credit. Always supported my decisions in my personal and professional life,” he said. ‘Tevar’, which hits theatre on January 9 next year, is a remake of Telugu blockbuster ‘Okkadu’. It stars Sonakshi Sinha opposite him. “I was very keen working with her (Sonakshi) and I told my father that she is the ideal choice for this role. She has a spark in her eyes which was the need of the role. Right from her first day on the set, I feel that she is a naturally gifted actress. She is a one take actress,” he said.

SIT set up to probe Delhi churchfireBy: Press Trust of India | New Delhi |
Posted: December 3, 2014 2:15 pm
A Special Investigation Team (SIT) has been constituted to probe the incident of fire which gutted an east Delhi church, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said in the Lok Sabha today.
He said that a Joint Commissioner of Police in Delhi is heading the SIT, which has been asked to give its report within two months.
The Home Minister assured the House that the government would “act strongly against anyone trying to hurt the sentiments of people believing in any religion or faith.”
He also told Speaker Sumitra Mahajan that if she so directs, the government would have no hesitation in tabling the copy of the SIT report in the House.
“As soon as I learnt of the incident, I spoke to the Lt Governor (of Delhi) and decided to set up the SIT,” he said.
The Home Minister’s statement came a day after members in Lok Sabha condemned the suspected burning down of the church in Dilshad Garden area of east Delhi and “attempts” to give it a communal colour.
P Karunakaran (CPI-M) had alleged the church and its exhibits were completely damaged and burnt down, claiming it was “a pre-planned attempt and not an accident … The intention is to turn it into a sensitive communal issue.”
Members of various opposition parties including Congress associated themselves with Karunakaran.

Shah Rukh Khan  Salman and Aamir do the toweldanceBy: Express News Service | New Delhi |
Posted: December 3, 2014 2:12 pm
We have always wondered about how it would be if the three Khans – Salman, SRK and Aamir – come together under one roof? And their presence at the recent event in Delhi left us asking for more.
The stage was set ablaze with their performances. By performance we do not mean any rehearsed dance moves – but a towel dance which the trio seemed to enjoy on the stage.
It seems that SRK and Aamir had been wanting to do it for long, but finally landed up doing it on stage at the show Aap ki Adalat. SRK leads the Khan gang with Rajat Sharma, Aamir and Salman behind them, all squeezing on to a single towel.
Really engrossed in the towel dance, we hope to see more such performances by the Khans in future.

Japanese asteroid probe sets off on six-year round trip journey to reveal origins oflifeBy: Associated Press | Tokyo |
Posted: December 3, 2014 1:54 pm
A Japanese space probe named after a falcon blasted off on Wednesday, setting off on a six-year round trip to an asteroid for samples that scientists hope will help reveal the origins of life.
The launch of the Hayabusa 2, postponed twice because of bad weather, comes less than a month after a European Space Agency probe landed on a comet in a pioneering mission.
Hayabusa means peregrine falcon in Japanese.
The probe will map the surface of the asteroid before touching down, deploying small explosives to blast a crater and then collect resulting debris.
Asteroids are believed to have formed at the dawn of the solar system and the probe’s target is one called 1999 JU3, which scientists believe contains organic matter that may have contributed to life on Earth.
The probe is expected to arrive at the asteroid in mid-2018 and return with samples in 2020, the year that Tokyo hosts the Summer Olympic Games.
The mission should help Japan’s space programme put a troubled past well behind it.
The first Hayabusa probe was unable to collect as much material as hoped but still made history by being the first vessel to bring back samples from an asteroid. Its seven-year mission ended in 2010 when it blazed a trail over Australian before slamming into the desert.
Both probes were developed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency.
The first Hayabusa probe was launched on the domestically developed H-2A rocket, as was Hayabusa 2. In 2003, an H-2A rocket carrying two spy satellites veered off course and had to be destroyed.
The Hayabusa 2 launch was first scheduled for Nov. 30 but delayed twice by bad weather. The last chance for a successful launch before 2016 would have been Dec 7.
The European Space Agency’s Philae probe finished a 57-hour mission on the surface of a comet on Nov. 15, but lost battery power due to landing in a spot shielded from the sun it needed to charge the battery for an extended mission.

Known to be an extremely private person, Bollywood actress Katrina Kaif recently bared her soul in an interview with fashion magazine, Vogue. The actress, who is dating actor Ranbir Kapoor, gives an insight as to who she really is, her likes and dislikes.
When asked who her closest friend in the world is, the ‘Dhoom 3’ babe revealed it is none other than filmmaker Ali Abbas Zafar who worked with the beauty in ‘Mere Brother Ki Dulhan’. Katrina, who played the female lead in the Imran Khan starrer, met the director on the sets of the rom-com and a close friendship blossomed between the two.
Though she may have not named Ranbir as her closest friend, the actress did pick him as her choice of ‘Desert Island Companion’. Well, the couple has been known to globe trot together quite a bit. They made headlines when they were spotted in Spain together last year, enjoying a day at the beach.
In the interview, Katrina also reveals tidbits about herself, including that she does not like being called ‘Kat’.
When it came to her favourites, ‘Gone With The Wind’ was the film she picked and ‘Twilight’ actor Robert Pattinson over heartthrobs George Clooney and Brad Pitt. Pancakes are her favourite Sunday breakfast meal and New York is her best shopping destination.
The actress also said she’d rather be called beautiful than sexy.

Sushma Swaraj defends Narendra Modis foreign trips  says they promotecooperationBy: Indo-Asian News Service | New Delhi |
Posted: December 3, 2014 1:35 pm | Updated: December 3, 2014 2:35 pm
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s engagements abroad have been aimed at promoting cooperation on skill development, advanced medical research and food security, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said on Wednesday.
Making a suo motu statement in the Lok Sabha on Modi’s foreign trips, Sushma Swaraj said: “Modi’s speeches in Hindi have been a national pride.”
“There is unprecedented optimism about India’s rapid progress under prime minister’s leadership and widespread expectation of effective and meaningful contribution from India for advancing peace, stability and prosperity in the world,” she said.
“At the heart of prime minister’s engagements abroad have been efforts to promote cooperation on skill development, advanced medical research for diseases, like the agreement on research for malaria and TB with the US, food security, such as our work with Australia on agricultural research, education, such as the agreement to collaborate with the US on a new generation Indian Institute of Technology,” she said.
Sushma Swaraj said that India’s engagements with the US also helped secure the country’s interests on food security in the WTO and advance the negotiations on the Doha development round of WTO.
“This initiative has contributed to strengthening the global trading regime, which is of direct interest to India, without in any way diluting our fundamental obligation to protect the interests of our poor,” she added.

Two Ahmedabad serial bomb blast accused seek private beddingWritten by Satish Jha | Ahmedabad |
Posted: December 3, 2014 12:42 pm | Updated: December 3, 2014 12:44 pm
Stung by the jailbreak attempt that had caused major embarrassment last year, the Sabarmati Central Jail authorities have refused to provide private bedding to two under trials in the 2008 serial bomb blast in Ahmedabad. The jail authorities have said that the facility of private bedding can’t be provided to them since the jail doesn’t have sophisticated equipments to scan the bedding.
Following the rejection, the under trials have approached the special designated court. According to the details, two accused Maulana Habib Falahi and Usman Agarbattiwala had sought permission from the jail authorities to allow them private bedding. However, the jail authorities refused citing security reasons.
Agarbattiwala’s lawyer DD Pathan placed a jail report before the court on Tuesday. He said, “I have placed some records in which the jail officials have said that if the medical officer gives a report saying that specific bedding is needed for medical purpose then only permission can be granted. However, the jail officials never approached the medical officer.”
After Pathan told the court that jail officials initially allowed his client’s request but didn’t take any decision the special judge PB Desai told Pathan to show the record. The matter has been kept for further hearing on Saturday.
Special public prosecutor HM Dhruva has opposed the application saying, “Private bedding can’t be permitted for security reasons. Permitting such requests would mean bringing highly sophisticated instrument from foreign country to scan the bedding.” Citing security concerns Dhurva has told the court that these applicants are also involved in the attempted jailbreak case who are kept in high security cell.
Falahi and Agarbattiwala are among the 65 accused lodged at Sabarmati Central Jail in the serial bomb blast case in which 57 persons were killed in July 2008. In February last year, 21 accused had attempted a jailbreak by digging a 200-ft long tunnel inside the jail. Agarbattiwala’s name has also figured in this case. Recently, his brother Rais had filed a petition saying that many of the accused are not allowed to meet their relatives and they are kept in dark places where sunlight can’t reach.

Loan repayment: Which one should you get rid off firstYou are here: Home > Collections
Which loan should you pay off first?

(Personal loans top the priority…)
Loans are an important part of modern day finance. Most of us rely on loans for funding things like higher education, buying cars and jewellery or going in for a home of our choice. Though loans boost our purchasing power, however, over-reliance on any kind of debt often leads to a strained financial life.
No wonder, one important question that many financial advisors often face from individuals is, when should they close their loans? "Exit strategy from the existing debts plays an important role in minimizing the interest burden on individuals. But there is need to prioritize your loan repayments because this ensures that your loans can be cleared in a systematic way to boost the available monthly surplus," says Nitin Vyakaranam, founder & CEO of ArthaYantra, an online financial planning firm.
Some experts suggest that you should pay off your debts from the highest interest rate to the lowest, as this will save you the most money over time. But there are also some other things to consider while prioritizing your loan repayments. Here we take a look at which loans should you pay off first and why:
Personal Loans
Personal loans top the priority list when it comes to paying off an existing debt. Personal loans are unsecured loans which are advanced on the basis of the borrower's credit history and ability to repay the loan from the available income sources.
"Being an unsecured loan, personal loans are often offered at a higher interest rate. A higher interest rate necessarily means higher EMI payments. Though the charges for personal loan repayments are also on a higher side, it is always advisable to close this high interest debt once an individual has enough surpluses," informs Vyakaranam.
Unproductive loans
Loan instruments such as gold loans, loan against property, loan against fixed deposits and insurance policies, loan against PF and auto loan do not attract any tax benefit. Such loans should be paid off based on the interest burden. The interest rate on gold loans and loan against property, for instance, is dependent on the pledged value and the loan amount.
For example, if an individual opts for 50% of the value of gold as loan, he/she is expected to get a better rate compared to those opting for the 80-90% of the value as loan. These loans hold a lesser interest rate compared to personal loans. Loans against fixed deposits, insurance and PF attract lower interest rates than the gold loans and loans against property.
  Educational Loan
The increasing educational expenses have aided in the increased demand for educational loans. Educational loans should be given second least priority before closing off the existing debts. The reason behind it would be the tax savings one can enjoy on the educational loans. One can claim tax benefit on the interest payments being made towards educational loan availed from approved institutions. So essentially the interest payments can be offset by the tax benefit and hence one is advised to pay off educational debt only after paying off other debts.
Home Loan
Home loans are the most common form of debt among the Indians. One can avail tax benefits on both the principal home loan repayment and interest payments on the home loan. The tax advantage makes the home loan the last debt an individual should pay off. The exit strategy for home loans also differs based on the tenure and the type of house. Generally in the initial years, majority of the EMI payments account for interest payments and during the last few years of the loan tenure they account for principal repayments.
Therefore, "it is advisable to consider prepayment during the first half of the loan tenure. If an individual has two existing home loans, then only interest payments on the second home loan, which is not self-occupied, are tax deductible. However, there is no cap on this deduction. So considering the tax benefits associated with them, home loans should be paid off after servicing all the other existing debts," observes Vyakaranam.
Though the above-mentioned priority list gives an outline of debt servicing, sometimes you may find an investment which pays you a higher interest rate than the interest rate being paid on the existing debt. As with any financial decision, make sure you analyze the pros and cons of whether to opt for an investment or to pay off the existing loan. Exiting a loan, thus, is an important decision that should be made using the scientific reasoning than the emotional one.

Reasonably comfortable  with CAD: Reserve Bankcurrent account deficit
("We are reasonably comfortable…)
MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India is "reasonably comfortable" with the current account deficit because of lower oil prices, deputy governor H R Khan said on Wednesday, after the government last week unexpectedly eased some rules on gold imports .
"We are reasonably comfortable from the current account point of view because of oil," Khan told reporters in the sidelines of an event in Mumbai.
"So taking all that into account, a view has been taken that we'll give up this 80:20 (rule on gold imports)," Khan told reporters.
The governnment had on Friday scrapped a rule mandating traders to export 20 per cent of all gold imported into the country - in what had been known as the 80:20 rule.
The government will soon announce the current account deficit for the July-September quarter.

Why do cybercriminals thrive in China?
New York Times Dec 3, 2014, 01.27PM IST
(A current favorite of Chinese…)
By Paul Mozur and Shanshan Wang
HONG KONG - In China, some of the most successful cyberthreats are frighteningly simple.
One recent viral mobile message offered free golden retriever puppies to lure users into giving away personal information. Another online scam took thousands from a woman who wired money to an impostor she thought was her son's teacher.
A current favorite of Chinese cybercriminals, according to Pei Zhiyong, the senior security researcher of the antivirus company Qihoo 360 Technology, is to simply program malicious code that asks users to disable their antivirus software.
"It will say their security program is incompatible with whatever they're trying to do," he said. "We call it a 'Candy Trojan Horse,' and 30 percent of users will actually respond by turning off their antivirus system."
Over the last decade, the Internet has gone mainstream in China. More than 600 million residents regularly go online, and China is also the world's largest smartphone market. And domestic companies like the Alibaba Group are among the largest Internet companies in the world.
In its early days, China's Internet market was plagued by malware and viruses. Popular free antivirus software offered by many companies has since helped stem that problem, but has led to a new one: Many PC users have become so comfortable that they are now easy prey to attacks that involve simply tricking them, instead of having their accounts breached by complex software. At Chinese companies, experts say, awareness lags that of their counterparts in developed nations.
In 2013, cybercrime cost Chinese companies and individuals $37 billion, according to a research report by the security firm Norton, putting the nation second behind the United States at $38 billion and well ahead of the $13 billion that cybercrime cost Europe or the $1 billion for Russia.
Security analysts offer many reasons for this, but top among them is the naivete of China's myriad new Internet users, as well as government policies that have emphasized the growth of the Internet industry above all else.
At the same time, many businesses have no consistent approach to ensure employees do not inadvertently compromise corporate networks. Companies also are often reluctant to pay for security software.
And the prevalence of pirated software in the country - and the back doors and other security holes in those programs - makes many businesses, and individuals, unwittingly vulnerable.
Beijing maintains strict control of the flow of information online and closely tracks many users. But it has focused far less on stopping cybercrime or punishing companies that enable or encourage attacks. As a result, China's companies tend to focus on attracting users above all else, and therefore a consensus among Chinese Internet companies on mitigating attacks has been slow to emerge.
  "The Internet companies assume everyone is going to play dirty, so that's how they approach it," said Mark Natkin, managing director of China tech research firm Marbridge Consulting. "The Dudley Do-Rights get chopped off at the knees, so instead of trying to clean things up, they get scrappy."
Things could get worse for China as new users take to the Web on smartphones. According to the Norton report, 75 percent of Chinese smartphone users have experienced mobile cybercrime in the 12 months leading up to the 2013 survey, compared with a global average of just 38 percent.
The high mobile cybercrime numbers are in part a result of government blocks on the Google Play app store, which offers applications for smartphones running the Android operating system.
"The ability to access Google Play is not there, so Chinese go to alternate app stores that don't have the security capabilities" of Google's official app store, said Michael Sentonas, the global chief technology officer for Intel Security.
A 2013 study by the Data Center of China's Internet showed that 35 percent of China's most popular 1,400 apps tracked user data that had no connection to the function of the application.
When customers then bring their phones into work, the situation becomes dangerous for companies as well, Sentonas said.
The huge cost of attacks on companies has led to growing awareness among executives, though analysts say many companies still lack a high-level executive charged with security. Efforts by companies to ensure that employees do not inadvertently compromise corporate networks have ranged from negligence to draconian measures, according to Thomas Parenty, the head of the information security firm Parenty Consulting.
In one instance, Parenty recalled how a manager of a Shenzhen company set up employee computers so they all faced the front of the room. He then set up his desk on a raised dais at the back of the room, giving him a view of employees' screens so he could track online activity.
"It was like Oliver Twist," he said.

Top 10 high value stocks that returned upto 201%; are they a buy now What experts sayYou are here: Home > Collections > Stocks
Top ten high value stocks; should investors buy, sell or hold?

(It has been a breakout year…)
NEW DELHI: It has been a breakout year for the Indian markets with the Sensex and the Nifty both rallying over 30 per cent each so far in the year 2014.
After a strong rally seen so far in the year, analysts are convinced that the bull run is here to stay and the Indian markets will make record highs in the year 2015 as well, supported by revival in investment activity, bounce back in economic growth and further policy announcements by the Modi-led government.
Foreign investors have already affirmed their stance on the Indian markets, considering the fact that global money managers have already poured USD 16.5 billion into Indian stocks so far in the year 2014.
Riding on the momentum, many high value stocks have more than doubled so far this year - which brings us to our next question: Is it advisable to hold them or investors should rather book profits on rallies?
Analysts are of the view that some of these stocks are overvalued and booking profits would be the right strategy. "Do not hold any stock based on rumor or speculation," warn analysts.
"Investors should not hold any stock for long periods of time when we know that it is significantly overvalued. Many investors like to chase these stocks since they have generated huge returns in the last few quarters or years," says Dr. Vikas Gupta of Arthveda Fund Management Pvt Ltd.
"This is a speculation on their continuing to perform fundamentally. While the probability of that is high too, the risk is very great if the lesser chances of them missing their fundamental expectations materialize. Then the result on the portfolio will be disastrous," he adds.
Investors can look at booking profits in logistic stocks as the government is on the planning stage to utilize huge infrastructure of the India Post for e-com logistics.
"Investors should hold consumer stocks like Eicher, Nestle and MRF," says Siddharth Sedani, Vice President - Portfolio Management Service at Microsec Capital Ltd.
"PSUs like Tide Water Oil, which has removed a lot of bottlenecks from its systems and is thriving for global business through its European and Middle East arm, may fetch better returns in future as valuations are still relatively inexpensive compared to companies like Castrol," he adds.
Sedani is of the view that companies like Bosch may still outperform as new technology innovations may bring better pricing power for the company.
We have collated recommendations from various analysts on the top ten high value stocks, which have rallied up to 200% so far in the year 2014:
MRF: Can book profits
"MRF has posted strong quarterly results recently with operating margins increasing on the back of low raw material cost. Auto ancillary is expected to show strong growth going forward and much of this has been factored in the stock price already," says Kiran Kumar Kavikondala, Director & CEO, WealthRays
Securities.
"Currently MRF's P/E is seen at 18.55, which is higher than the industry P/E of 15.54. Investors can lighten their portfolio and can direct investment to its peers with better forward P/E," he adds.
 
Bosch: Can test 27000 mark in next 8-12 months
"It has multiplied exponentially in five years i.e. from roughly 2800 to over 19500 levels and still there's no sign of exhaustion. As per the projection technique, it can test the 27000 mark in the next 8-12 months," says Ajit Mishra, AVP - Equity Retail Research, Religare Securities Limited.
Tide Water Oil India Ltd: Accumulate the stock and retain in your portfolio
The stock at current price is trading at 9.59 P/E, with FY15E P/E of 16.3. Therefore accumulate decision is recommended. The stock can be retained in portfolio, the company has been expanding its global footprint and has strong operating margins, says Kavikondala of WealthRays Securities.
Eicher Motors: Maintain your long positions
The stock has been outperforming majority of its peer in the auto segment and steadily marching northward with every passing day. So, maintain your long positions, says Mishra of Religare Securities Ltd.
Page Industries Ltd: Valuations look slightly stretched
"The company has performed well in Q2, but much of it has been factored in and valuations are slightly stretched," says Kiran Kumar Kavikondala, Director & CEO, WealthRays Securities.
"Investors may trim their position and move into other stocks. With the current price of the stock FY15E P/E is expected at 51.95, which is lower than current P/E of 68.18," he adds.
Shree Cements Ltd: Can test Rs 14000 mark in coming months
"Though the majority of cement counters are in a consolidation phase, it's gradually inching upward. It can test the 14000 mark in the coming months," says Mishra of Religare Securities Limited.

TN Assembly to meet for three days

Tamil Nadu
The winter session of the Assembly will be held for three days, starting from Thursday (December 4).
The House will meet on Friday and Monday (December 8), according to a time-table released to the media on Wednesday.
On the inaugural day, the second supplementary estimates will be presented in the House, which would hold a debate on the estimates.

A long  lonely fight: hail the tenacity of Bhopal gas survivorsprint
Thirty years have passed, but for the residents of the jhuggies around the former Union Carbide India Ltd (UCIL) plant, that night will still be as searing in their memory. A few had unskilled jobs in the pesticide plant, but they were equally oblivious of the nature of the deadly vapour that enveloped their colonies, choking them to death and injuring thousands more in the vicinity and far beyond in Bhopal. The simple device of keeping indoors and covering mouths with a wet cloth may have saved hundreds of lives of those who fled their homes.
The repercussions of Bhopal, the world’s worst industrial disaster, have been felt throughout the globe. If one takes major incidents involving only chemical plants, it is far worse than the leakage of agrochemicals at Sandoz in Basel, Switzerland, where tonnes of pollutants entered the Rhine river in 1986, turning it red. It is worse than Seveso, near Milan in Italy, where deadly dioxin, one of the most toxic chemicals, contaminated the environment in 1976, leading to an EU directive named after it. It is worse in numbers, though arguably not in severity, than even Minamata, Japan, where a chemical plant released effluent containing mercury into the sea in the 1950s. Fish absorbed it, and in turn were consumed by humans, leading to the severest forms of disability.
Bhopal reminds us, first of all, that there is a deep-seated class divide when it comes to victims of industrial disasters. Because most of those who inhaled the poisonous gas were slum dwellers around the plant in congested ‘old’ Bhopal, they did not receive as much attention as would have better-off residents. Imagine what would happen if an Indian chemical multinational in the globalised world of today was negligent enough to release toxic fumes in a town in Europe or the US, leading to the deaths of a few thousand people.
The very fact that there is no accurate estimate of the toll speaks for itself. While the immediate official figure was 2,259, the Madhya Pradesh government estimated that 3,787 died of exposure to the gas. Others believe that 8,000 died in two weeks and a similar number later. In 2006, official estimates put the number of the injured — severely or slightly — at 550,000. In the days after December 3, hospitals were hopelessly ill-equipped to deal with patients in such huge numbers.
It reminds us that the management of all major industrial plants, including nuclear power stations, must be proactive in informing residents in their vicinity of possible accidents, and what precautions to take. In Bhopal’s immediate aftermath, a UCIL official stated that the gas was only a minor irritant to the eyes. The US parent, Union Carbide Corporation (UCC), was not forthcoming, either. There was confusion regarding what the gas was and only later did it transpire that it was methyl isocyanate (MIC), which has traces of cyanide.
The confusion was compounded by the lack of information regarding the antidote. The medical director of Union Carbide in the US cabled the Bhopal authorities to administer sodium thiosulphate to victims if cyanide poisoning was suspected, which he later denied at a press conference in Bhopal. A few days after the leak, a German toxicologist administered this chemical, but a patient died, after which he was asked to leave town. Conspiracy theorists had a field day and it is not clear till now whether this treatment only had a placebo effect. It should be incumbent on the management of any chemical, industrial or nuclear plant, whether in the private or public sector, to inform the authorities of proper antidotes for a specific hazard. The right to know Act should help elicit such information.
Bhopal also reminds us, precisely at a time when environmental laws are being streamlined and diluted, of the need to have firm regulation of such plants. There was a raging debate on whether the UCC should be tried in the US or India. There was the nationalist argument that India was well within its rights to hold the company guilty, a matter of the country’s sovereignty. On the other hand, US law on such liability was far more stringent and its courts tended to act with greater speed. After being heard in the US, where UCC offered $350 million as compensation, which the Indian government turned down, the case was shifted to India in 1986.
In Orwellian 1984, it was estimated that there were a million cases pending in Indian high courts and 140,000 in the Supreme Court. This points to the need to tighten laws, not loosen them, although there is a strong case for expediting decisions in courts. Among the environmental laws the TSR Subramanian committee has just reviewed is the Environment (Protection) Act of 1986, which was specifically legislated in the wake of Bhopal.
The tragedy reminds us of liability laws. The UCC, which held a majority of the UCIL’s shares, tried to pass the buck to the UCIL. Prior to US President Barack Obama’s visit, the government is trying to assuage the fears of foreign (largely American) suppliers — as distinct from operators — of nuclear power plants regarding their liability in an accident, as the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act of 2010 prescribes. Ironically, the BJP had joined the Left in including this penal clause, which has kept foreign firms at bay.
Finally, Bhopal reminds us of how one values lives, especially those of the poor. Infamously, it was said after 1984 that Indian lives — specifically of those casual labourers who lived around the plant — were cheaper than American lives, measured by annual earnings. In 1989, the Rajiv Gandhi regime inexplicably agreed to an out-of-court compensation of $470 million, a second major betrayal after the tragedy itself. That the victims continue to fight for their rights is a tribute to their tenacity.

Mona Lisa might be a Chinese slave  suggests Italian historianMona Lisa might be a Chinese slave, suggests Italian historian
AFP  Beijing, December 03, 2014
First Published: 12:47 IST(3/12/2014) | Last Updated: 13:18 IST(3/12/2014)
An Italian historian's theory that Mona Lisa might be a Chinese slave and Leonardo da Vinci's mother- making the 15th-century polymath half-Chinese- sent online commentators into a frenzy Wednesday.
The identity of Mona Lisa has long been a matter of debate (Photo: Shutterstock)
Angelo Paratico, a Hong Kong-based historian and novelist from Italy, told the South China Morning Post: "On the back of Mona Lisa, there is a Chinese landscape and even her face looks Chinese."
Chinese web users expressed astonishment and disbelief Wednesday, posting dozens of parodies of the painting, with faces from Chinese comedians to British actor Rowan Atkinson grafted over her delicate features.
Little is known about Caterina, the mother of the artist, writer, mathematician and inventor, and the identity of the sitter for the portrait hanging in Paris' Louvre museum has long been a matter of debate.
Paratico, who is finishing a book entitled Leonardo da Vinci: a Chinese scholar lost in Renaissance Italy, cited Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud's 1910 assumption that the painting was inspired by the artist's mother.
"One wealthy client of Leonardo's father had a slave called Caterina. After 1452, Leonardo's date of birth, she disappeared from the documents," he told the paper.
The evidence for a Chinese connection appears to be slight, with Paratico saying he was sure "up to a point" that da Vinci's mother was from the Orient. "To make her an oriental Chinese, we need to use a deductive method," he added.
Many posters on China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo were incredulous.
"I'm so sad that you thought I'm a foreigner!" wrote one, with an image of a frowning Mona Lisa holding two rolls of toilet paper and blowing her nose. "I'd rather be from wherever I am loved."
Another user replaced her features with unlikely faces ranging from Chinese male comedian Zhao Benshan to British actor Rowan Atkinson, to a grimacing robot holding a Mona Lisa mask.
The topic had been viewed more than four million times and triggered 160,000 postings by midday Wednesday.
"I now understand why her smile looks so mysterious and concealed- it's typically Chinese," said another poster.

Govt contradicts Amit Shah; says Burdwan blast  Saradha not linkedGovt contradicts Amit Shah on Burdwan blast
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, December 03, 2014

The government Wednesday contradicted Bharatiya Janata Party chief Amit Shah's allegation that money from Saradha chit fund was used in the October 2 blast in West Bengal's Burdwan saying the probe has so far not revealed any connection.
Jitendra Singh, minister of state in the prime minister's office, in a written reply in Rajya Sabha said there was "no link". The minister also clarified there was no evidence yet that money from the scam was sent to Bangladesh.
"The investigation has so far not revealed any such transaction where money was routed to Bangladesh to fund terrorist activities," Singh told the House.
 
Shah, while speaking in Kolkata on Sunday, had alleged that Mamata Banerjee's government and her party, Trinamool Congress, were
shielding the accused in the Saradha scam.
"Saradha chit fund money was used in the Burdwan blast. The NIA is not being allowed to probe the blast properly. Hurdles are being
created. It is being done in order to save TMC leaders who are involved in the blast," Shah had alleged, attacking the Trinamool Congress.
 
The minister was asked whether the government has sought details of the probe into the Saradha chit fund scam after reports indicated that a part of the money was routed to Bangladesh to fund terror activities. Singh replied that government has not sought details of the
probe.
 
To another question on whether the Saradha chief has admitted that he paid large sums to several people to influence the case in his
favour, Singh said "the matter is under investigation."
As the Opposition, especially the Trinamool attacked Shah, Union minister Babul Supriyo, elected on BJP ticket from West Bengal, expressed surprise over Singh's statement and alleged that the ruling party in Bengal and its MPs had links with terror plot in Bangladesh.
"I came to know about Jitendra Singh's statement a little while back. There is a different reason. There were a lot of responsible minds who acted very fast to ensure that the state government has evidence, proofs and it has been recorded in front of several TV cameras," Supriyo told reporters outside Parliament.
"The state government was instrumental in destroying evidence that could prove state government's, TMC's or their MPs' connection with the terror plot that is not only West Bengal centric but also finds its way into Bangladesh and neighbouring countries," he said.
"So it was very smart of the central government to get NIA into the act. NIA is right now doing a very comprehensive research into the entire act. I got to know what Jitendra Singh said a while ago. I need to find out why he said so."
On October 2, a blast in a house in the Khagragarh area of Burdwan in West Bengal killed two people and critically injured a third person.
Investigators suspect people who were living in the house belong to a Bangladeshi militant organisation known as the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh.

Bengaluru shocker: 3-yr-old sexually abused inside school  twiceComments
A three-year-old girl was allegedly sexually assaulted twice in the premises of a private school in the fifth such incident in as many months.
The accused, a school attendant, was arrested on November 30 after the mother of the victim registered a police complaint, city police commissioner M N Reddi told PTI.
In the complaint filed on November 29, the mother alleged that the child was sexually abused twice on October 22 and November 26, Reddi said.
The attendant has been booked under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act and Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code (relating to punishment for rape).
The latest incident comes weeks after the sexual assault of a six-year-old girl in a school by a Hindi teacher who was arrested. In another incident in October, an office assistant in a school here was arrested for sexual assault of a three-and-a-half-year girl.
An eight-year-old girl was allegedly sexually assaulted by her 63-year-old teacher inside her school premises over a period of time with the offence coming to light in early August, barely a month after the rape of a six-year-old girl at 'Vibgyor High' school.
The series of incidents of sexual assault of minor girls in schools in Bengaluru has led to concerns over safety of children. Police had issued safety guidelines for schools, which in many cases have been found to be observing them in the breach.

Speaking from the heart: Clarke says goodbye to  little brother  HughesClarke's bids tearful farewell to Phillip Hughes

Australia captain Michael Clarke urged mourners to "dig in and get through to tea" as he choked back tears in an emotional eulogy for Phillip Hughes at the cricketer's funeral on Wednesday.
A near-constant presence at Hughes's bedside during his two-day fight for life, Clarke sucked back deep breaths at Macksville High School hall during the tribute to his "little brother's" spirit.
"Oh, he would definitely be calling me a sook (crybaby) right now, that's for sure," Clarke began, gasping for air in the stifling hot room packed with 1,000 people.
"I don't know about you, but I keep looking for him. I know it is crazy but I expect any minute to take a call from him or to see his face pop around the corner.
"Is this what we call the spirit? If so, then his spirit is still with me. And I hope it never leaves."
Hughes died last Thursday at the age of 25, two days after being rushed to hospital for emergency surgery, having been struck by a rising delivery during a domestic match at the Sydney Cricket Ground.
Clarke joined fellow cricketers and Hughes's father and brother among the pallbearers in delivering the coffin to the hearse before it set off in procession through the cricketer's hometown of Macksville, New South Wales.
The 33-year-old skipper spoke of his visit to the SCG wicket on the night of Hughes's death.
"I knelt down and touched the grass, I swear he was with me," said Clarke, who had helped usher Hughes into Australia's state ranks then the national team.
"Picking me up off my feet to check if I was okay. Telling me we just needed to dig in and get through to tea.
"Telling me off for that loose shot I played. Chatting about what movie we might watch that night. And then passing on a useless fact about cows.
"And I could see him swagger back to the other end, grin at the bowler, and call me through for a run with such a booming voice, a bloke in the car park would hear it.
"Is this what indigenous Australians believe about a person's spirit being connected with the land upon which they walk? If so, I know they are right about the SCG. His spirit has touched it and it will forever be a sacred ground for me."
Clarke said Hughes's death would strengthen the bonds of cricket around the world.
"Phillip's spirit, which is now part of our game forever, will act as a custodian of the sport we all love. We must listen to it. We must cherish it. We must learn from it," he added.
"We must dig in," Clarke faltered, crying.
"We must dig in and get through to tea. And we must play on.
"So rest in peace, my little brother. I will see you out in the middle."

Halftime Report
The  Omaxe board has approved a proposal to raise Rs 500 crore over the next 2-3 years to fund ongoing projects. Talks are on to raise Rs 100 crore via NCDs in the next couple of months.
Mohit Goel, CEO of Omaxe says the company is in talks with a lot of merchant bankers and the interest will most probably be below the average cost of borrowing. "The coupon rate for the NCD is yet to be finalized," he told CNBC-TV18.
Currently, the company has a total debt of Rs 1,000 crore and in the next fiscal year it will remain in the Rs 800-1200 crore range, he adds.
Below is the verbatim transcript of Mohit Goel's interview to CNBC-TV18's Sumaira Abidi and Latha Venkatesh
Sumaira: This money that you will be raising is to fund some on going projects. What are the projects that you have raised this money for?
A: There are many projects which are running right now so we will raise this fund majorly for delivering our ongoing projects which are there in Chandigarh, Lucknow, Ludhiana, majorly three states, Punjab, UP and Haryana. So it is all across the board.
The Rs 500 crore will be raised over a period of next two-three years and the first tranche of NCD we are thinking of raising in the next one-two months.
Latha: What is the likely yield on the NCDs and will it be a little less than the current debt you have, I mean the interest that you are paying on the debt.
A: We are talking to a lot of merchant bankers right now so the coupon rate is yet to be fixed but I think it is going to be below the average current cost of borrowing for us.
Latha: So would you be replacing some existing debt or all this is additional incremental debt?
A: We would be putting this fund to actually concession activities because we are majorly concentrating on delivery so we want to deliver our projects quickly and there is a possibility that we would replace the higher cost of funding as well.
Sumaira: So what is your total debt?
A: Presently it is Rs 1000 crore and next financial year it is going to remain in the range of Rs 800-1200 crores.
Latha: What is the advantage of this floor area ratio increase that you are getting in Delhi? Is that far rule going to help you in any fashion?
A: We don’t have any stake in Delhi, we don’t have any project in Delhi presently but otherwise generally of course it is a good thing for Delhi but it is going to be useful for few pockets of Delhi, not the total of Delhi.
Latha: Are you likely to see any project coming into income recognition this quarter or the next?
A: Yes in next six months there will be many projects which would actually come in revenue recognition. Majorly it is going to be Chandigarh, Lucknow and Ludhiana.
Sumaira: Has there been any improvement in revenue recognition because last time when we spoke to you in your Q2 results, the indication was that this low revenue recognition and the big drop that you had in areas sold was what was actually dragging your earnings lower. Have things improved, are you seeing a lot more activity in demand?
A: In terms of sentiment things have improved. So I believe next 6-12 months it would actually translate into a number of bookings and then revenue recognition as well.
Latha: How are you looking at realisations, are things picking up or are they stable?
A: We are absolutely stable and we think we will be stable for the next 6-12 months. I don’t see rates going up but if the transactions go up, that is actually good for any real estate company in India right now.

Crude price fall may improve NIMs by 40-50bps: Coromandel

Street Signs
In an interview to CNBC-TV18, Kapil Mehan, managing director,  Coromandel International says the company’s net interest margins (NIMs) are likely to improve by 40- 50 basis points (bps) on the steep fall seen in global crude prices.
Furthermore, Mehan says the company is not likely to have more than a 5 percent production impact on the damage caused by cyclone Hudhud.
Below is the verbatim transcript of Kapil Mehan’s interview with CNBC-TV18\\'s Anuj Singhal and Ekta Batra.
Anuj: The first thing I want to understand is that will you have any kind of benefit from lower crude prices. Would crude be part of any of your input costs and would you have any kind of beneficial impact?
A: Yes, the beneficial impact would be in the form of ocean freights and maybe overall impact that will have on the nitrogenous part of raw material equation where we have ammonia and urea products because they are directly linked to gas prices and general energy prices. So there we could see some benefit flowing in. In the packaging material polymer prices have come off a bit in the recent past but they should come down further. So those will be the sort of small benefit that we expect these oil prices is to have on our business.
Ekta: If in case on a hypothetical basis all things being constant or Ceteris paribus in terms of revenue and you did margins of say, 10 percent in the previous quarter how much benefit would crude being lower help you in Q3 and what could the margin picture look like?
A: It would be a few basis points monthly. I have not done any calculations of that but I suppose it should not be more than 40-50 basis point impact on overall basis but that will play out over a period of time because ammonia which is one of our key raw materials which is directly related to gas price etc but has been holding high but it has started now slowly softening. So that should flow in the benefits that over the next two to three months. Similarly the packaging material prices have come off little bit in the recent past by about four to five percent points. So that is a small saving that we have. Then freight costs in general both for ocean freight as well as domestic freights will come down. So, let us say 40-50 basis points is something that we can expect to have an impact.
Ekta: I just wanted to touch upon your Q3 revenue because we do understand that there could be a one off impact because of the cyclone that took place. So how of disruption did you see and how would it impact your Q3 numbers?
A: We were disrupted in Vizag site only and that also was disrupted for a period of one month and there again we had started back and in the month of October there would be some impact. November we sort of came quite close to our normal production so impact on the overall quarter will not be four to five percent. It is a little over five percent of our production for the quarter overall, because other sites have been producing well.
Anuj: Your debt is quite high at this point in time. Any issue over there in terms of next few quarters. We believe you have problems of serving some of these debts because of the kind of financials you have?
A: If you look at our debt profile more than 80 percent of our debt is really short term debt which is in the form of financing our raw materials and receivables etc. So last quarter when we had closed our September quarter we had some punching of raw material shipments etc which we have to, as per accounting standards, show as working capital. And that is how the borrowing levels look higher but otherwise our long term borrowing quantity used to be very healthy.
So, I don’t think that is an area of concern. Now that those inventories are getting consumed so that will improve. Our receivables have been improving month-on-month (MoM) and that continues to improve because market demand supply fundamentals have improved. The demand in Rabi has been good. So with that overall we expect our working capital to improve over the next few months.
Coromandel Int stock price

Below is the verbatim transcript of Nooresh Mirani's interview with CNBC-TV18.
South Indian Bank  has consolidated for almost a couple of months around Rs
27-28 and today it has given a triangle breakout around Rs 28.50 which gives a target price of Rs 34-35 which is the previous stoploss. The stock has not performed in the banking space and finally we are seeing good volume as well as breakout. So this is a good short to medium-term bet.
NESCO  is an interesting company, after making a move above Rs 1,000 which was
a multi-year resistance, the stock consolidated around Rs 1,300, somewhere closer to Rs 1,350 was the breakout point and the stock has crossed into all time highs. Therefore, the best way to look into a momentum trade or even an investment in a good bull market is to buy
when the stock makes new all time high.
The stock has given channel breakout or a flag breakout above Rs 1,350. We are looking towards a target price of Rs 1800 over the nextfew months. One can buy the stock at current level as well as on dips and a stoploss would be placed closer to Rs 1,300.

New Delhi: Giving a statement on the recent foreign visits of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj on Wednesday assured the Lok Sabha that such trips "will help us achieve the mission of a developed India."
There has been a boiling controversy over Modi's visits abroad. He has often been referred to as "NRI PM" by opposition parties. Reacting on the issue, Swaraj said, "Modi's visits have helped boost bilateral ties and attract international investment in India."
Swaraj also said the PM has been successful in signing various international pacts on energy and security cooperation during his visits. She also assured the House that the PM also raised the issue of black money during his meeting with heads of other countries.
"PM Modi believes in cooperation of neighbouring countries which is why he invited them to his swearing-in ceremony in May. PM on many occasions, has said that a developed India can only be based on a secure India." Swaraj said.

Gold prices slide on easing of import curbs by RBIGold prices slide on easing of import curbs, silver tanks
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: November 29, 2014  | 17:15 IST
(Photo: Reuters)
Gold prices continued their southward journey for the fourth straight session at the bullion market due to reduced demand from jewellery stockists and retailers.
The government late on Friday unexpectedly scrapped the controversial 80:20 scheme, easing restrictions on gold imports that were originally put in place last year to curb ballooning current account deficit.
There are expectations that the Reserve Bank of India's move would increase gold supplies and reduce prices for buyers in the domestic markets, a bullion trader commented.
Standard gold (99.5 purity) dropped by Rs 165 to end at Rs 26,000 per 10 grams against Friday's level of Rs 26,165. Pure gold (99.9 purity) also shed by a similar margin to close at Rs 26,150 per 10 grams, as against Rs 26,315.
On the global front, the yellow metal took a sharp plunge worldwide overnight following heavy funds selling spooked by sliding crude prices and also stronger dollar.
Investors' caution ahead of an upcoming Swiss referendum on central bank gold reserves also weighed on sentiment.
December gold fell $21.40, or 1.8 per cent to settle at $1,175.20 an ounce on the Comex division of the NYMEX late yesterday, while silver tumbled 1.06 cents to end at $15.49 an ounce.
Meanwhile, silver took a major bearish hit and plunged below the Rs 36,000 mark on the back of frantic sell-off by speculative traders amid weak industrial buying.
Silver (.999 fineness) tanked by Rs 580 to finish at Rs 35,990 per kg, compared with Rs 36,570 on Friday.

Shiv Sena to join BJP government in MaharashtraBJP, Shiv Sena finalize power sharing formula in Maharashtra
By ANI | ANI –  Tue 2 Dec, 2014
Print
Mumbai, Dec.2 (ANI): Leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Shiv Sena have reportedly finalized a power sharing formula that  could see the latter joining the Devendra Fadnavis-led Maharashtra Government as also the government at the Centre.
The power-sharing formula, according to media reports, was arrived at late last night between Shiv Sena and BJP leaders at Fadnavis's official residence 'Varsha' in South Mumbai.
At the meeting, the Shiv Sena was represented by Subhash Desai and Anil Desai, while the BJP delegation at the talks included Fadnavis and senior ministers Sudhir Mungantiwar, Vinod Tawde, and Chandrakant Patil.
Tawde later told media that various power sharing formulas were discussed during the meeting and eventually one of them was agreed upon.
He said top leaders of both parties will discuss the formula today and then take a final call on whether to go ahead with it or not.
On Monday, Fadnavis had expressed confidence that a positive outcome would emerge out of the talks with the Shiv Sena on the allotment of portfolios.
He said negotiations were heading in a positive direction, and added that the Shiv Sena was almost in agreement with the BJP's 2:1 seat sharing formula. (ANI with inputs)

To gain the upper hand  Amazon disrupts itselfDavid Streitfeld: To gain the upper hand, Amazon disrupts itself
David Streitfeld |  Dec 02, 2014 09:46 PM IST
Sometime last summer, a quarter-billion dollars went missing at Amazon.
Analysts were expecting the usual gangbusters third quarter. But it was about $250 million short of forecasts.
Here is one way to look at the disappointing results: Amazon, for all its heft, is starting to lose momentum. It was rejected by some customers who were put off by its acrimonious dispute with the publisher Hachette over e-books, while others found its prices less compelling than they once were.
But few things about the retailer are ever clear-cut, so here is another interpretation: Amazon is intentionally cannibalising some major product lines - offering free or nearly free music, video and e-books - to draw tens of millions of people into its ecosystem.
Far from being weak, Amazon in this view is so strong that it is disrupting not only other retailers but also itself, knowingly and eagerly, as it seeks to leverage its powerful e-commerce operation to become a retail and entertainment colossus. It wants to sell devices, entertainment and services as well as basics like milk and toilet paper.
"Everything you buy, starting with your weekly groceries, will be flowing through one pipe called Amazon," said Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York University's Stern School of Business. "They'll have your credit card purchase history, be able to do data-mining on your needs, offer massive selection with a reputation for low prices."
Building that pipe requires nimble execution and vast investments. Amazon said on Monday that it would be raising a significant but unstated amount of money through a debt offering, which caused Moody's Investors Services to cut its outlook to negative from stable. Amazon secured a $2-billion line of credit in September.
In its 20th year, Amazon's losses are increasing. Critics say the company is too ambitious. Admirers believe it will dominate in a way no company ever has.
But the risks are great. Amazon needs to be aggressive, but that behaviour can backfire. Some analysts said Amazon took in less revenue than expected in the third quarter, at least in part because some customers were turned off by its confrontation with Hachette. If one category - North American media sales, which means books, DVDs and CDs - had performed the way it usually did, Amazon would have made that $250 million.
Before the third quarter, North American media sales were increasing an average of 15 per cent year over year. The latest increase was less than five per cent, which made it the slowest quarterly growth for the category in five years.
When Amazon reported its latest financials, it gave two explanations for the slowdown in media growth: customers were renting textbooks instead of buying them, and there were difficult comparisons with the third quarter of 2013, which featured heavy discounting.
If Amazon means that prices are now higher than they were, that is something Brian A Rosenwald knows all about.
A doctoral candidate in American history at the University of Virginia who needs to stretch his entertainment dollars, Rosenwald likes to buy hardcover mysteries so he can pass them on to his father. He has noticed his Amazon discount shrinking. Two years ago he paid $14.01 for the new volume by John Sandford in his Prey series. This year's volume was released in the spring with a publisher's list price of $1 more than the earlier volume. It never got lower than $17.32.
So Rosenwald is cutting back. Last year, he bought 17 printed novels from Amazon. So far this year he has bought three. "I'm shifting to buying more very lower-dollar digital items instead of more expensive physical items," he said.
If customers think of Amazon less in terms of individual products and more as a bundle of goods and services, then price shifts are less relevant. And the company is constantly working to augment that bundle. For several years, it has offered members of its Prime shipping service free video streaming. It has been spending heavily to add original programming. During the summer, Amazon introduced a Prime music service and, for a monthly fee, a book subscription service.
While Amazon does not give numbers of Prime subscribers, most analysts think those numbers have been increasing rapidly from a base of 20 million. The Prime subscribers, who pay $99 a year for two-day shipping and all of the media, are the most enthusiastic Amazon customers. Set against that opportunity, what is a few missing media sales?
"In essence it appears they're mortgaging one smaller business" - media sales - "to drive the much bigger, longer-term business opportunity of overall retail leadership," said Peter Hildick-Smith of the Codex Group, a book industry research firm.
That, he added, has risks for content creators, which might be one reason the traditional publishing industry was on edge during the stand-off with Hachette.
"If books, video and music continue to be relegated to a 'free' commodity for all Prime customers to enjoy, does this then ultimately devalue each of these content markets, in the process marginalising their producers' business models?" Hildick-Smith asked.
Even as Amazon moves aggressively to reshape media consumption, it is trying many other merchandising formats. For instance, it just introduced the Echo, an oddball interactive cylinder for the home that, among other features, allows hands-free shopping.
Then there is the frenzy over physical stores, which are this year's equivalent of delivery by drone - a development that excites the imagination but is unlikely to come to pass any time soon.
When The Wall Street Journal reported in early October that Amazon was opening "the first brick-and-mortar outlet in its 20-year history" across from the Empire State Building "in time for the holiday shopping season," the news unleashed a torrent of commentary despite a lack of confirmation from Amazon.
Galloway, who also runs an e-commerce consulting firm, L2, argues that the future belongs to multichannel merchants - those who let customers order online and pick up in a physical location, or who ship online and allow for returns in a physical location, or who allow browsing in a store but ship to a home.
"Stores may have found the vulnerable soft tissue of Amazon: its lack of stores," Galloway said. "This is the revenge of the brick."
He says he believes that within the next 12 months, Amazon will be opening hundreds of "dark" stores, which are places where people can pick up things, or make a "transformative acquisition" along the lines of Best Buy or Radio Shack.
But people are not going to be getting their stuff from an Amazon store in Midtown Manhattan this holiday season. A spokeswoman said in a statement that the 470,000-square-foot building was "primarily" corporate office space, and that the ground floor retail shops would be subleased.
As so often regarding Amazon, speculation outran reality.

That old majority ruleAshok Lahiri: That old majority rule
Ashok Lahiri |  Dec 02, 2014 09:50 PM IST
One of the controversial aspects of The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 relates to the consent clause. When for public purpose and the land will be directly controlled by the government, no consent of the landowner is required for compulsory acquisition. But when for private companies, the consent of at least 80 per cent of the project-affected households (PAH) needs to be obtained. For public-private partnerships (PPPs), consent is required from 70 per cent. Is 70 or 80 per cent too high or too low? Why not 100 per cent or a simple majority?
There are two different perspectives on democracy - procedural and epistemic. A "procedural democrat" wants the system to be fair. How can you acquire land enjoyed by a family for long without its consent? But even the fairness argument recognises that there may be others who want the area to develop, infrastructure to be improved and industries to be set up for generating income and employment. A fair balance needs to be struck between those in agreement with the land acquisition and those against it. Thus, even procedural democrats would not insist on consent of 100 per cent.
The "epistemic democrats" believe that voters will pursue their individual good through the political process, and that the summation of these individual pursuits will further the collective welfare. A famous quote from E B White is, "Democracy is the recurrent suspicion that more than half the people are right more than half the time."
Is a private or a PPP project for which land is being acquired good for the community of affected people? There may be several arguments in favour, for example, better employment opportunities and living conditions. Arguments against, for example, may be that it will disrupt the traditional way of life and community cohesion. There is rampant corruption, and once the land is handed over, whether the project developer will honour the commitments she has made before the acquisition is suspect. Who is right: those in favour or those against? The majority may be wrong. But a cognitive failure contaminating the intuition of a rational majority more than the intuition of a rational minority is a hard case to argue.
A simple majority rule of consent from the PAH for compulsory acquisition of land for private and PPP projects appears to make sense. The argument seems to be particularly strong with everyone, not only rich landowners, entitled to vote for and against acquisition.
Way back in 1785, the French philosopher and mathematician Marquis de Condorcet propounded the famous "Jury Theorem" that can shed light on the issue. The problem of choice in a democratic set-up can be solved by a simple majority rule, particularly when the choice is between two alternatives: for example, to acquire compulsorily - yes and no. One of these two is optimal, but we know not which for sure. Though any single voter - in this case, the PAH - may not know the "optimal", we need to assume that the average voter is more likely to choose the optimal answer than the wrong one. What Condorcet proved more than two and a quarter centuries ago is that if the voters choose independently, the choice with the most votes is likely to be the "correct" decision.
What will happen if we insist on much more than a simple majority for going with "yes"? Take the case of a jury. The choice is between sentencing a person accused of a crime guilty or not guilty. There are two mistakes to be avoided - pronouncing guilty when she is not, or acquitting when she is guilty. If we go by unanimity, we will minimise the risk of pronouncing guilty when she is not. With a majority rule, the jury is likely to minimise the risk of acquitting when she is guilty.
Condorcet's Jury Theorem appears to apply to land acquisition because it is safe to assume that every participant in the consent process agrees about the objective - development, growth, employment generation and poverty alleviation. They may have different views about the process of achieving it. Increasing the proportion of consent beyond a simple majority will only minimise the risk of destabilising the status quo when acquisition may not deliver the desired result. But clearly what is more important is to maximise the likelihood of going ahead with projects when it is indeed in the interest of the people. Risk aversion is not the right recipe for rapid development.
Old Condorcet's Jury Theorem is not valid if some of the assumptions do not hold. For example, there may be tactical voting, or the choice not really about whether to acquire or not, but what to do after acquisition or how to acquire. But The Right to Fair Compensation Act does not throw any light on why it has departed from the simple and elegant majority rule.
One of the reasons for insisting on the 70-80 per cent consent clause may have been about "correctness" of the acquisition from a moral or natural justice point of view. Majority may acquiesce to compulsory land acquisition, but a minority's religious or emotional sentiments may be affected and some very persuasive arguments may be marshalled why compulsory acquisition violates natural justice. But, by that argument, compulsory acquisition should be allowed only if no one objects. And if everyone agrees, there is no need for compulsory acquisition to begin with! The current consent clause appears to have been more about valence and safeguarding the status quo than a clearly argued case. High time it is substituted by a rule of simple majority.

Though arbitration is held out as a speedy and cheaper alternative disputes resolution mechanism, recent Supreme Court judgments have lamented that it has proved to be "highly expensive and time-consuming in this country" (Dolphin Drilling vs ONGC). It has even rued that "the way the proceedings are conducted and without exception challenged in the courts has made lawyers laugh and philosophers weep."(Gurunanak Foundation vs Rattan Singh).
Several vague provisions in the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, not to speak of the arcane terms in the bulky contracts, make this field a corporate lawyer's delight. The 1996 Act modelled on the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law or UNCITRAL has run deep into legal muddle as seen from recent judgments of the high courts and the Supreme Court. By drawing every little issue to the courts, arbitration has become another tier in civil litigation.
Last week, the Supreme Court delivered a typical judgment in which the dispute started around 1995, the award was delivered in 2005, the first challenge before the single judge of the Delhi High Court was decided in 2006 and the appeal before the same court was decided in 2012 (Associate Builders vs DDA). The journey is probably not over; there are two more last-mile leaps to correct errors, if any, committed by the judges before - a review petition and a "curative petition".
The Act limits appeals against arbitral awards in Section 34. However, that wordy provision has not deterred appeals and the Associated Builders judgment cites some 20 precedents on this question. An award can be challenged if it is against the "fundamental policy of Indian law or interest of India or contrary to justice and morality." These are elastic phrases that can be moulded into any shape in the hands of the judges in individual cases.
For instance, there is a lengthy discussion on what is "morality", a woolly idea, which is playing havoc outside the court. The Indian Contract Act also uses this word and it means only "sexual morality". In the context of arbitration law, the judgment clarified that morality would mean "the enforcement of an award, say, for specific performance of a contract involved in prostitution." The judges further clarified that the court would interfere with such awards "only if something shocks the court's conscience." A discussion on what is the "fundamental policy of India" and what is against the "interest of India" is as murky as the air in the Chief Justice's court (which was found to have four times more than the permitted levels of pollution last Friday).
Despite the bar on court interference, the Supreme Court hears and decides a score and more appeals in arbitration cases every year. The high courts have their own heavy dockets. Appointment of arbitrators, for instance, is the first contentious issue. In the recent Reliance KG gas price row, this process took nearly two years, with one long Supreme Court judgment hastily withdrawn because some facts were overlooked by the judges.
Then a question is often raised whether there is an arbitration clause at all in the contract. Even the best draftsmen are not free from errors, negligence or deliberate mystification. Another recurrent disagreement is over the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal. Other nettlesome issues that stall arbitration till the courts deliver the last word are: the conduct of the arbitrators, the governing law in international contracts and enforcement of foreign awards.
The Law Commission, in its 246th report on amendments to the existing law, has made several suggestions, including a fixed fee structure to beat the soaring cost of arbitration. The proposed schedule of model fee would be as impracticable as the little known one for Supreme Court lawyers. There are nearly a hundred proposals to improve the 1996 Act.
An earlier attempt to update the law on the basis of the 176th report failed since the amendments were passed by the Rajya Sabha in 2003, but the standing committee wanted to improve on the Bill, which ultimately lapsed. Another opportunity has come now to infuse faith into arbitration but the moot question is whether it would meet the same fate as its predecessor.

A new frontier in bankingSubir Roy: A new frontier in banking
Subir Roy |  Dec 02, 2014 09:44 PM IST
If the guidelines finalised by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for issuing licences for limited banking - payment and small banks - actually result in a critical number of such banks taking off, then it will have an impact on the banking scene similar to what was initiated with bank nationalisation four decades ago.
Banks were nationalised in order to take banking to the entire country and all its citizens. The limited success of public sector banks in this regard has now prompted the banking regulator to devise these new types of banks and also grant a banking licence to a microfinance organisation to complete the task of financial inclusion. The aim is to facilitate payments and transfers, small savings, and small loans for all.
If these new entities succeed, then the space for commercial banks will be partly circumscribed. State-owned banks will lose most of their developmental agenda and have to compete with the private ones in the conventional commercial banking space without being able to justify their performance on their developmental responsibilities.
To compete with the new private sector banks, like HDFC Bank and Axis Bank in particular, the state-owned banks will have to be given a level playing field. They have to be allowed to run their affairs totally professionally, without political and bureaucratic interference, by paying their people market-determined compensation and expecting performance similarly benchmarked to the market.
In such a situation, it is difficult to see the government continuing to retain control, not letting its shareholding go below 52 per cent and thereby perpetuating the kind of management culture that prevails today. It is possible that the RBI is driving the government as bankowner into a corner. It is creating a situation where the state will no longer be able to justify owning full-fledged banks - precisely the situation that leads to the creation of huge non-performing assets because of corruption, inefficiency and cronyism, all justified in the name of aiding the poor.
The first consequence of a significant number of payment banks operating with equal access to the several electronic systems of funds transfer is to take away a part of the "float" (money in transit) from commercial banks. This is money for jam, on which banks pay no interest. Plus some fee-based income, even if small, from remittance work will go.
The second consequence of these new banks opening large numbers of small savings and current accounts with them will be for commercial banks to lose a part of their CASA (current and savings account) deposits that are a key source of low-cost funds. It is the not-so-well-off who keep most of their money in savings accounts; the better off look for facilities that give at least a positive real rate of return.
The small banks will also take away a part of the loan portfolio of commercial banks pertaining to small businesses and farmers. The delinquency in these is high, particularly losses resulting from politically directed loan write-offs for farmers. But the way in which corporate borrowers have been faring ever since the 2008 global financial crisis broke, with banks having to take haircuts from restructuring of large non-performing loans, it has become difficult to say which class of assets is riskier.
It is not as if the success of the new types of banks is a given. They will have to succeed where commercial banks have largely failed - making small transactions emanating from millions of small customers and small loans pay for themselves. The new private sector banks have solved this problem by mostly shooing away small customers.
The new type of banks will have to extensively use information technology and extend their reach through the use of business correspondents. It is exciting to visualise the day when the ordinary unsmart cellphone or smartphones available at the price of unsmart ones will be the medium for most transfers and the local village grocer or all-purpose storekeeper will be routinely used to draw and deposit cash. Neither he nor the business correspondent will offer their services free - they will demand a commission that will initially appear unaffordable for both the banks and their customers. But if these banks are able to unearth even a portion of the cash that lies idle in rural areas or with conservative minded people, then that will be a big plus.
The city types who man commercial banks have managed to get away with only token rural postings. Thus, these banks have failed to tap the huge persisting unbanked potential. It is exciting to visualise a weavers' cooperative being able to easily get working capital for its members (the politically captured cooperative banks having failed them) or the migrant worker sending money home with a full sense of comfort. There are enough entrepreneurs willing to take the risk and invest Rs 100 crore in setting up such banks.

How the worlds most wanted Nazi evaded justice for more than 60 yearsBy Abby Ohlheiser December 2 Follow @abbyohlheiser
This undated photo shows Austrian-born Alois Brunner, a Nazi lieutenant and senior aide to Adolf Eichmann. (Agence France-Presse)
Alois Brunner was the right-hand man to Adolf Eichmann during the Holocaust. But unlike his boss, Brunner evaded justice — and Nazi hunters — for decades, even as witnesses described encounters with the man in Syria. And now, Nazi-hunter Efraim Zuroff of the Simon Wiesenthal Center is certain that Brunner died at least four years ago, "unrepentant" in Damascus.
Brunner, who would be 102, was responsible for deporting more than 125,500 Jews in Europe to Nazi death camps during World War II. "The victims' families are a very large group and it's fair to say the people who suffered at his hands would have wanted him to be punished and would be disappointed," Zuroff told the Sunday Express  this weekend. According to Zuroff, the Wiesenthal Center learned of Brunner's death from a "former German secret service agent who had served in the Middle East." The former agent told the center that "Brunner was dead and buried in Damascus" at least four years ago.
Zuroff described Brunner as "unrepentant" at the time of his death, adding, "He said himself his one regret was he did not kill more Jews." That's probably a reference to a 1987 phone interview Brunner gave to the Chicago Sun-Times. In it, he said , "the Jews deserved to die. I have no regrets. If I had the chance I would do it again." Brunner ran the Drancy transit camp outside Paris starting in 1943. During his tenure at the camp, there was a rapid deterioration in conditions for inmates, along with an increase in deportations to death camps, the New York Times writes.
Simon Wiesenthal, the Nazi hunter, described Brunner in his memoirs thus: "Among Third Reich criminals still alive, Alois Brunner is undoubtedly the worst. In my eyes, he was the worst ever. While Adolf Eichmann drew up the general staff plan for the extermination of the Jews, Alois Brunner implemented it.” Eichmann, widely considered a main organizer of the Nazi plan to exterminate Europe's Jewish population, was captured in 1960 in Argentina , tried in Israel and hanged.
In 2001, Brunner was sentenced in absentia to life in prison by a French court for arresting 345 orphans in Paris and sending them to the Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen death camps, weeks before Paris's liberation. Just 61 of those children survived. During the symbolic trial, prosecutor Hervé Stephan said Brunner's "final arrests sprang from a desire to deport and to exterminate the very last Jewish children it was still possible to find on French soil."
So how did a notorious Nazi such as Brunner manage to evade justice for so long? The officer reportedly escaped from Europe to Syria in the 1950s and stayed put. Brunner reportedly used the fake name of Georg Fischer for years — something Brunner confirmed in the brief Sun-Times interview. Brunner has also said that his escape worked thanks to a mix-up with a similarly named ex-Nazi  — Anton Brunner, who was hanged for war crimes. The mix-up was eventually untangled, but it gave Brunner time to flee and settle in Syria.
But little else about his story is confirmed.
Notably, that includes reports that Brunner lived in Syria under the protection of the Syrian government. Brunner reportedly helped  President Hafez al-Assad develop torture tactics for the regime. However, Syria has never confirmed that Brunner played a role in the government or even that he lived there with the regime's knowledge. Zuroff described Brunner as "involved in the harsh treatment of the Jewish community of Syria" and being "an expert in terror and torture."
In 1991, former New York Times executive editor A.M. Rosenthal described Brunner's Damascus residence as something of an open secret: "For much of that time he has lived under the name of Georg Fisher at 7 Rue Haddad," Rosenthal wrote, "where foreigners have spoken with him and occasionally photographed him. In the past few years he even sat for a couple of interviews, in which he talked of his service to the Third Reich."
Rosenthal added that the Syrian government "quietly" rejected extradition requests from "France, Czechoslovakia, Austria and Germany." There are rumors that Brunner was very close to extradition to East Germany, just before the fall of the Berlin Wall. The fall reportedly halted the intended exchange.
But Brunner's time in Syria was not quiet. Yitzhak Hofi, a former Israeli spy chief who died this year, said the Mossad tried to kill Brunner in Syria in 1980 with a letter bomb. The attack took Brunner's eye and several of his fingers, but he survived. The bombing was one of two reported attempts on the former Nazi's life by Mossad — the spy agency also sent a pipe bomb to his house in 1961.
Brunner was last seen alive in 2001, at the Meridian Hotel in Damascus. According to Zuroff, the upheaval of Syria's civil war has made confirming the Nazi's death — or locating his burial site — impossible, at least for now. "No sane person is going to try to travel there to find out," Zuroff told the Sunday Express.

South Korea approves plan for new Christmas tree to annoy North KoreaBy Rick Noack December 2 Follow @rick_n
It's Christmas time, and North Korea will soon get a holiday greeting. On Tuesday, South Korea approved a plan from a Christian activist group to set up an illuminated Christmas tree along the border of its northern neighbor on Dec. 23, the Associated Press reports . For two weeks, the 30-foot-tall tree is supposed to send a message of peace -- but it will almost certainly prompt anger instead.
Until recently, a 65-foot-tall tower that was first  set up  in 1971 and later converted to resemble a Christmas tree was visible to North Koreans living close to the border. The tower was repeatedly condemned by the North, who called it a "provocative display of psychological warfare," according to the  Guardian .

To counter the holiday symbol, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's regime threatened to fire shells at the tower. Earlier this year, South Korea's military took the structure down, arguing that it was no longer safe. Some, however, considered the decision to be a political message from South Korea to the North.
In October, North Korea warned of a "catastrophic impact" if a similar structure was ever rebuilt. “The tower is not a tool for religious events but a symbol of manic attempts to raise cross-border tension and provoke armed conflicts," North Korean news agency KCNA said.

Such threats, however, do not seem to have deterred South Korea. “We accepted the request … to guarantee free religious activities,” South Korean defense ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said on Tuesday, referring to the Christian group's new plan.
Officially, North Korea is an atheist country, and the possession of a Bible can result in imprisonment or even death . According to North Korean teaching, the country's late founder, Kim Il Sung, and his son, Kim Jong Il, are referred to as gods and other religious beliefs or symbols are suppressed in the secretive nation.
Activists have tried to find ways to reach North Koreans by sending them Christian messages. In the past, balloons carrying plastic bags with pamphlets of Bible scripture were sent to the North.

In 2005, Douglas Shin, a California-based Korean American missionary involved in the efforts, told The Washington Post: "Some people don't like using the word crusade, but that's exactly what this is -- a crusade to liberate North Korea."
A recent U.N. report of the Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  identified religious believers among six groups of victims against whom North Korea had committed crimes against humanity. "[Religion] has been compared to a drug, narcotics, a sin, and a tool of Western and capitalist invasion. Christian missionaries are portrayed as the product of USA capitalism and work akin to vampirism," the report noted.
There were also indications of a "genocide against religious groups, specifically Christians, in particular in the 1950s and 1960s." The North Korean regime has denied those allegations.
Because of the persecution of Christians all over North Korea, Christmas is a holiday that can only be celebrated under extreme danger. Instead, on Dec. 24, the isolated country celebrates the birthday of Kim Jong Suk, the mother of Kim Jong Il. Many people make pilgrimages to her birthplace in the northeastern part of the country.
For Constitution Day, celebrated shortly afterward, North Koreans get a day off. As  Time pointed out in 2009, it is uncertain whether the dates of those revolution-related events are coincidences or whether they are supposed to deliberate substitute for Christmas.

A cold and rainy Tuesday night before a milder  cloudy WednesdayBy Angela Fritz December 2 Follow @angelafritz
Radar & lightning: Latest regional radar shows movement of precipitation and lightning strikes over past two hours. Refresh page to update. Click here or on image to enlarge. Or see radar bigger on our Weather Wall.
A winter weather advisory remains in effect for the far northwest suburbs, including Frederick County, until 1 a.m. Wednesday, for the possibility of freezing rain and sleet. Ice accumulation up to 1/10 of an inch is possible.
Most of the sleet and freezing rain stayed well north and west of the D.C. region today, but that didn’t make it any less unpleasant. Is there any weather that’s worse than a frigid rain? Showers — and sometimes moderately heavy rain — will continue through the night. Wednesday will be milder, though we won’t really see the sun.
Through Tonight: Another patch of moderate rainfall on the way, which will arrive in the western suburbs around 6 or 7 p.m., moving east into D.C. between 7 and 9 p.m. These showers could be heavy at times, though the heavier rain should clear out of the area by midnight, beyond which lighter showers are possible through the early morning hours. Steady temperatures overnight around the mid-30s.
Tomorrow (Wednesday): A chance of showers decreases through the morning hours, but clouds will linger all day. Highs rebound into the mid-50s in the suburbs and the upper 50s in the city, with the help of a south wind at around 5 to 10 mph.

No  youre not sleeping enough: 15 scary facts in new documentaryBy Emily Yahr December 2 Follow @emilyyahr
A new documentary by National Geographic illustrates the perils of sleep deprivation. (National Geographic TV)
You just enjoyed a long Thanksgiving weekend, so presumably you’re fairly well-rested, right? If not, prepare to be scared by some facts unleashed in a new National Geographic Channel documentary.
The two-hour “Sleepless in America,” a collaboration by NatGeo, National Institutes of Health and The Public Good Projects, debuted on Sunday night. The gist: Everyone is tired. No one gets enough sleep. And then this: Chronic sleep deprivation could have irreparable damage to your health.
NatGeo airs many documentaries, but with this one, they combined a timeless issue with a very timely topic: A lack of sleep hits close to home for pretty much everyone these days. “Sleep right now is one of those conversations that’s long overdue,” Army Surgeon General Patricia Horoho says in the film. “But it’s getting the national attention that it needs.”
It was a riveting two hours — no, really! — packed with anecdotes and interviews with experts who urge the need for change and more scientific research to help an increasingly sleepless culture. If you missed it (“Sleepless” airs again Dec. 7 at 9 a.m.), here are some of the facts that make us want to start going to bed very early every night:
1) Although there is debate about the magic number of sleeping hours, experts here recommend a solid eight. That said, 40 percent of American adults are sleep-deprived; the average American sleeps less than seven hours per night during the week. Meanwhile, 70 percent of adolescents also fall behind the recommended amount.
2) Lack of sleep is a serious problem in our constantly moving, 24/7 society: People are getting thousands of hours less sleep than they once were. As the documentary puts it, sleep is being “decimated” by our overstimulated culture with so much technology and gadgetry that distracts everyone all the time. Plus, people are overworked, so they no longer have enough time to do the things they want during the week. As a result, they stay up even later on weekends so they can compensate.
3) Sleep is “just as important as good nutrition, physical activity and wearing your seatbelt” — but many people greatly underestimate their need for it.
4) This quote from Mark Rosekind, member of the National Transportation Safety Board: “Every aspect of who you are as a human, every capability is degraded, impaired, when you lose sleep. What does that mean? Your decision-making, reaction time, situational awareness, memory, communication, and those things go down by 20 to 50 percent.”
5) When sleep gets shorter than seven hours a night, there’s evidence that there’s an increased risk for obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and even Alzheimer’s disease. The film also interviewed David Gozal at University of Chicago, a doctor who conducted a study linking an increased risk for cancer to lack of sleep.
6) An NIH study reduced subjects’ sleep to four hours a night and saw the impact on their weight. Turns out, sleeplessness increases an appetite for fatty foods, and the study showed that “short sleepers” consume 500 more calories a day than people who get enough sleep.
7) Almost all mental illnesses have associated sleep problems, experts say. In fact, sleep deprivation is nearly universal in every psychiatric condition, from bipolar disorder to anxiety disorders.
8) When you sleep, the brain clears out toxic chemicals — and one of the proteins that accumulates in the brain while you’re awake is associated with Alzheimer’s disease. Jeffrey Iliff, a doctor at Oregon Health and Science University, talks about his research into the link between poor sleep, clear thinking and Alzheimer’s.
9) Many factors are out of our control when it comes to sleep, particularly due to long hours at work or the type of job you have. The documentary looked in particular at health problems in shift workers required to work overnight, as it becomes much more difficult to manage blood sugar with those hours.
10) Another issue is people who operate machinery in late hours. “People that try and operate (driving their car, flying an airplane, running a train) during the night — they basically have to overcome physiological programming in their brain that says you’re supposed to be asleep,” Rosekind said.
11) The top cause of high-severity crashes on the road is fatigue.
12) There’s a term known as “microsleep,” defined as “momentary bouts of sleep that occur involuntary and can last up to 5 or 10 seconds.” It could occur at any time and have fatal consequences; the film profiled a man who lost his wife and two of his children after they were hit by a sleep-deprived driver.
13) Adolescents are biologically programmed to stay up later and wake up later, yet high schools force their students to wake up absurdly early. There’s a battle going on in high schools about later start times. The documentary featured one fight at Fairfax County Schools, where school starts at 7:20 a.m.
14) Studies show that high school school students who sleep more have higher test scores and lower rates of depression; the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends high schools should start at 8:30 a.m. or later. ( An update since the documentary was produced: Fairfax County Public Schools approved a change, and high school will start between 8 and 8:10 a.m. beginning in Fall 2015.)
15) One of the most frightening facts was all the benefits that we’re missing out on if we stay up too late every night. The good news is that sleep can “inspire creativity, re-balance emotions, help refresh cardiovascular health, metabolic health and boost our immune system.” We just have to figure out how to get it.
According to “Sleepless in America,” we’re supposed to sleep as soundly as this. (Olesia Bilkei/iStockphoto)

Express IT Awards: Frankly  he makes newsMotherson Sumi to buy German firm for Rs 283 crore
Come January, 46-year-old Francisco D’Souza, chief executive officer of IT major Cognizant, will complete eight years at the top, an eventful time during which he has grown the New Jersey-headquartered IT services firm from $1.42 billion in 2007 to a projected $10 billion. Without doubt, a tremendous performance.
Francisco, or Frank, as he is popularly known within Cognizant, is the Newsmaker of the Year winner at the Express IT Awards 2014, to be awarded in Bengaluru on Friday. It has been a landmark year for the firm, which completed its largest acquisition by buying out US-based healthcare software company TriZetto for $2.7 billion in September, a deal that catapulted the firm to newer heights. D’Souza, who became CEO at 38, has successfully taken on homegrown heavyweights like TCS, Infosys and Wipro by adopting a differentiated strategy. The son of an
Indian diplomat, who was born in Nairobi, D’Souza is known to be a tough taskmaster, driving himself as hard as he drives his team.
“Our success is largely driven by our differentiated financial and operational models and the meticulous delivery and execution against them.
We owe our industry-leading growth to three key aspects of our strategy: Our client-centricity, disciplined focus on core industries, services and geographies; and reinvestment of excess non-GAAP operating margins back into our business,” he said in an earlier interview.
“To us, what is most significant is that we continue to take market share and grow faster than our peers,” he added.
With a global headcount close to 200,000 with around 75% of the team in India, Cognizant has remained as agile as ever. Since 2007, the firm has consistently outperformed peers clocking a revenue growth of anywhere between 20% and 40%; 2009 was an exception when it grew just 16%, hit by the global financial crisis. D’Souza, in many ways a global citizen having been educated across three continents — Africa, Asia and North America — has used the multicultural approach while globalising his firm’s business.
A self-taught software programmer, Frank at the age of 16 sold his first inventory management system for the Trinidadian Army. D’Souza is also a risk taker, an attribute that has helped him scout for new opportunities even as he sharpened the focus on a few select verticals. The IT services major earns more than 65% of its revenue from just two vertical clusters, financial services and healthcare.
Cognizant’s core competence has always been customer-centricity and this is thanks to D’Souza’s relationship skills — he doesn’t mind travelling halfway across the globe to meet a customer even if it’s for a few hours. In February 2013, General Electric, the American conglomerate, elected D’Souza to its board of directors in a grand testimony to his skills and leadership qualities. The young lad who joined Dun & Bradstreet — Cognizant started life as the in-house technology development unit of D&B — in 1994, has certainly come a long way.

On funding spree  Flipkarts Sachin  Binny Bansal invest $1 mn in start-up AtherFlipkart co-founders Sachin and Binny Bansal have invested $1 million in Ather, a start-up focused on designing high-speed electric two-wheelers, in their third investment since June. Serial entrepreneur and Medall Healthcare CEO Raju Venkatraman also participated in this round.
Incubated at the IIT Madras, Ather was launched in 2013 by Tarun Mehta and Swapnil Jain.
According to Mehta, the fresh funds will be used for research and development of components like battery, charger and android dashboard.
While the company has already built prototypes of the vehicle, it will take another four months to offer test rides to the public. A full-fledged sale will commence in 12-14 months.
“Sachin and Binny Bansal’s focus on technology and reinvention aligns with that of the Team Ather. Electric vehicles are still at a very nascent stage in India and our aim is to develop and introduce efficient electric scooters which will benefit the country and help manage its resources more effectively,” Mehta said.
Ather raised their first round of capital, $100,000, in February this year from Aerospike founder V Srinivas and the Technology Development Board, government of India.
Incidentally, the Flipkart co-founders have been on an investment spree ever since the Flipkart’s acquisition of Myntra in May.
In June, Bansals, along with Saif Partners and other angel investors, participated in a $700,000 funding round for Touchtalent, a social networking site and platform for artists to sell their work.
A few weeks later, Binny Bansal invested in fashion-focused social network Roposo.
Bansals again invested in News in Shorts, which provides news in 60 words, in July. This was followed by an another investment in offline games start-up MadRat Games in November.
“We believe that the world is moving towards a smarter, more energy-efficient and environment-friendly approach in our daily lives. Growing Indian start-ups like Ather are using technology successfully to make a mark in this field,” Sachin and Binny Bansal said in a statement.
Incidentally, Bansals are not the only Indian e-commerce entrepreneurs to have turned angel investors. Snapdeal’s Kunal Bahl has also invested in Delhi-based online chat platform Zumbl and taxi services company Ola, which recently raised a staggering $210 million from Japan’s SoftBank.

Oil Tumbles Anew on Iraqi Export Deal  Futures Margin HikeYou are here: Home Commodities
Oil Tumbles Anew on Iraqi Export Deal, Futures Margin Hike
Reuters | Updated On: December 03, 2014 10:44 (IST)
India to Weigh Gold Policy Impact After Spurt in November Imports
New York: Oil prices resumed their slide on Tuesday after rising in their biggest rally in two years the day before, hurt by a deal that will add more Iraqi crude to already oversupplied markets, higher margin requirements for trading US futures, and a stronger dollar.
Iraq's government said it reached an agreement with Kurdish authorities to export 300,000 barrels per day of oil from Kirkuk and 250,000 bpd from the northern Kurdish region through Turkey. The deal aims to overcome months of dispute that all but halted exports from Kirkuk.
"The Iraqis deal with the Kurds for oil exports is the one headline sticking out in today's market, a reminder that the oversupply in oil isn't going away easily," said Joseph Posillico, an analyst at Jefferies in New York.
Benchmark Brent crude oil fell $2.00, or 2.76 per cent, to settle at $70.54, nearly testing Friday's close of $70.15, the lowest since mid 2010. Brent jumped more than 3 per cent on Monday on speculation that its sharp drop following last week's OPEC meeting was overdone.
US crude fell $2.12 to $66.88. It rose 4 per cent on Monday for its biggest gain since August 2012.
Selling pressure intensified after CME Group Inc raised initial margins for crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange by 15.6 per cent from the close of business on Tuesday, likely prompting liquidation by loss-making long traders, brokers said.
The dollar hit a 4-1/2-year high, helped by comments by two influential Federal Reserve officials who stressed the positive impact on the US economy of the drop in energy prices. A stronger greenback often weighs on prices of dollar-denominated commodities.
Crude futures briefly pared losses after Saudi Arabia's former intelligence chief said the world's top oil exporter would consider cutting production if joined by others, including non-OPEC producer Russia.
Saudi Arabia sent oil prices into a tailspin last week when it blocked efforts by smaller exporters in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to curb output.
"Volatility sometimes begets volatility, and the oil markets are not being helped by all the conflicting signals they're getting now," said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital, an energy hedge fund in New York.
US crude oil stockpiles likely rose by 1.3 million barrels last week, according to a survey of analysts ahead of government data due out on Wednesday.

Sharad Pawar injured in fall at home  rushed to MumbaiPeshawar school attack: Pakistani pupils recall narrow escapes, carnage in Taliban slaughter
NCP chief Sharad Pawar was today admitted to a hospital here after he sustained leg injury from a fall at his Delhi residence.
“Pawar sustained leg fracture at his Delhi residence. He insisted on being treated in Mumbai and was accordingly flown here today,” NCP sources told PTI.
The air ambulance carrying Pawar landed in Mumbai at 11.15 AM and he was taken straight to the Breach Candy Hospital where doctors will decide the next course of treatment after a thorough examination, the sources said.
NCP leaders Praful Patel and Chhagan Bhujbal were among those present at the hospital when the ambulance carrying Pawar reached around noon.
A three-time Chief Minister of Maharashtra and a former Union Minister, the 73-year-old leader was accompanied by wife Pratibha and daughter Supriya Sule in the air ambulance.
Pawar, who left Congress and formed the Nationalist Congress Party in 1999, is currently a member of Rajya Sabha.

Why are private equity suits funding my ride back homeWhy are private equity suits funding my ride back home?
Surabhi Agarwal | New Delhi Dec 03, 2014 11:08 AM IST
Uber is running taxis at fares almost comparable to auto rickshaws. TaxiForSure is offering cabs for Rs.49. And Meru just introduced 30 per cent cash back on each ride. These enticements are becoming too much to resist. But, why is every other taxi service on a mad spree to offer free or subsidised rides? 
The lure of deep discounts on e-commerce portals already has the country in its grip. The likes of Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon are spoiling consumers in India by offering free shipments, easy return, cash on delivery and crazy discounts on products. They are hoping that offering these freebies will get consumers on board initially. These consumers will later turn into regulars “out of habit” or having realised the “convenience” of online shopping.  
Does the same logic apply to taxi service providers as well, which are currently the darlings of private equity funds? 
Google backed Uber recently raised a giant round of $1.2 billion in funding from a group of mutual fund managers and venture investors. In the latest round of investment, Ola received $210 million funding from Japan's SoftBank. And TaxiForSure is said to be in talks with private equity majors to raise $180-200 million.
Most people are currently hailing taxis from Uber or Meru or TaxiforSure out of curiousity or because they are hugely subsidised. But, will people continue to take their services after the discounts are over? Will the country’s urban be “habituated” to call a cab over using public transport or their own cars? Will “convenience” rule over “cheaper” options?
A brief conversation with a driver of TaxiForSure revealed that the taxis enrolled with the company charge a minimum of around Rs 240 for the first four kilometers while the company charges its customers Rs 50. That is a subsidy of almost Rs 200 on each ride. Why? 
Uber last week ran a promotion where it offered five free rides in a week to users just to graduate them onto their new payment model – a digital wallet. 
Private equity majors are pumping billions of dollars in e-commerce, perhaps because there is a strong business case for online retail. Internet kills the traditional supply chain of offline retail. Minus the real-estate and the manpower, there are huge savings from running a brick and mortar store.  It is argued that when people at a huge scale start buying online these very savings will pay for the deep discounts on products, as well as free shipping, the cost of cash on delivery etc. Private equity and venture capitalists won’t need to pump more funds in these companies then.
But, does the same hold true in the case of the taxi industry? It is true that the current disruption in the taxi industry is making entrepreneurs out of struggling and unemployed youth. They are able to earn a decent living while the taxi companies are not only subsidising the rides for them but also financing their vehicles apart from other freebies. 
One can also argue that the technology being brought by these firms is bringing economies of scale where the fleets with the traditional taxi owners are not lying idle for long durations and proving to be more productive for all stakeholders. The economies of scale will definitely lower the cost of running a taxi. 
But, no matter how many people start hailing taxis, the bare minimum cost of running a car (that is fuel and the driver’s salary) will never go down beyond a certain point. And the rates at which these firms are currently offering the taxis are clearly untenable.
In this scenario, the only situation in which the model looks sustainable is when people find it so convenient to hail a taxi that they give up their own vehicle. In such a case they would not mind paying slightly higher than the public transport for their daily commute, which comes minus the hassle of maintaining an own vehicle and a driver etc. In case people do not want to give up on their own vehicles completely, they can enrol with the taxi hailing services which can call upon the vehicle when not in use by the owner. When this happens at a mass level (if it does), it will solve many issues at one go -- the biggest one being that of urban planning by de-congesting the roads and the parking spots.
Now, that will be doing some real good.

Cabinet nod to amendments to Companies ActCabinet approves amendments to Companies Act to improve ease of doing business
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: December 3, 2014  | 14:10 IST
Photo for representation purposes only. (Source: Reuters)
The Cabinet on Tuesday approved amendments to the Companies Act to improve the ease of doing business and to specify punishments for illegal deposits.
The amendments to the Companies Act, 2013, which came into effect from April 1 2014, have been proposed "in order to address some issues raised by stakeholders such as chartered accountants and professionals," said an official statement in the national capital after a Cabinet meeting.
The Corporate Affairs Ministry has had extensive consultations with stakeholders in the matter.
Under the new norms proposed, the paid-up capital criteria has been scrapped while threshold limits for various transactions for getting shareholders' approval has now been stipulated.
"Omitting requirement for minimum paid up share capital, and consequential changes (For ease of doing business )," the Cabinet  approval read.
Another amendment approves "prescribing specific punishment for deposits accepted under the new Act". This was left out in the act inadvertently, the statement added.
Towards meeting a "corporate demand", the amendment proposes "prohibiting public inspection of Board resolutions filed in the Registry", the Cabinet statement said.
Among the major concerns of stakeholders were protecting the confidentiality of board resolutions, as well as the provision of auditors being required to report suspected frauds at the companies audited by them.
"Enabling provisions to prescribe thresholds beyond which fraud shall be reported to the Central Government (below the threshold, it will be reported to the Audit Committee)," the Cabinet said in its approval.
Stakeholders were also concerned that stringent regulations for related party transactions, or those transactions between the company and another in which a board member or members are interested, could hurt routine business activity.
The new Companies Act proposes to exempt corporates from the need to get the nod of shareholders in cases of related party transactions valued lower than Rs.100 crore or 10 per cent of net worth.
Under the old system, the permission of shareholders through a special resolution was required in case of related party transactions for all firms with a paid up capital of Rs 10 crore or more.
"Replacing 'special resolution' with 'ordinary resolution' for approval of related party transactions by non-related shareholders," the Cabinet statement said.
Another amendment approved by the cabinet for tabling in parliament exempts related party transactions between holding companies and wholly owned subsidiaries from the requirement of approval of non-related shareholders.

In emails  Steve Jobs determined to keep iPod Apple-onlyMotherson Sumi to buy German firm for Rs 283 crore
Legendary Apple CEO Steve Jobs had seven words for a subordinate when he learned that a rival company was about to introduce a program that would let music fans buy songs anywhere and play them on Apple’s iPod devices.
”We may need to change things here,” Jobs said in a terse, 2005 email that was shown to jurors in federal court Tuesday, on the opening day of trial in a billion-dollar antitrust lawsuit that accuses Apple Inc of using unfair tactics to maintain its dominance in the digital music business.
Attorneys for an estimated 8 million consumers and iPod resellers say Jobs’ email spurred an internal campaign to keep Apple’s popular iPods free of music that wasn’t purchased from Apple’s own iTunes store. By updating the iTunes and iPod software to block music from competing online stores, Apple maintained a closed system that discouraged consumers from buying competing music players, plaintiffs’ attorney Bonny Sweeney argued Tuesday. That froze out makers of rival devices, and allowed Apple to sell iPods at inflated prices, she told jurors.
Plaintiffs’ attorney Patrick Coughlin also showed jurors a 2003 email from Jobs, written about the launch of another competitor’s online music store, which said, ”We need to make sure that when Music Match launches” their store, ”they cannot use iPod.”
Apple lawyers deny the company competed unfairly. Several high-ranking Apple executives are expected to testify during the trial.
And while Jobs died in 2011, he is a central figure in the class-action case. Sweeney said she will show a video of Jobs testifying in a 2011 deposition later this week. A partial transcript of that session shows Jobs asserting he couldn’t remember details of actions taken several years earlier, while also betraying signs of his legendary impatience. In one exchange with attorneys, Jobs acknowledged that he helped write a press release statement that accused RealNetworks of ”adopting the tactics and ethics of a hacker to break into the iPod.”
Jobs’ statements have turned out to be pivotal in other antitrust cases that Apple has faced in recent years, including one in which a judge found Apple conspired with publishers to set e-book prices. In another, a federal judge cited ”compelling evidence” that Jobs was a central figure in an alleged conspiracy by leading tech companies to abstain from hiring each other’s employees.
A Stanford economist will testify later in the iPod trial that Apple overcharged iPod buyers by nearly $350 million. Under federal antitrust law, the Cupertino, California company could be ordered to pay three times that amount if jurors agree that Apple’s actions were anticompetitive.
But attorneys for Apple said their own experts will testify that the plaintiffs’ economic analysis is deeply flawed. Apple lawyer William Isaacson also told jurors that Apple had legitimate competitive reasons to update its software with new consumer features as well as code that blocked music from other sources. Legitimate product improvements are allowed under antitrust law, regardless of their impact on competitors.
The close integration between Apple’s iPods and its iTunes store allowed them to work better for consumers, Isaacson said, adding that software developed by rival music sellers such as RealNetworks could have posed a security threat to the iTunes software.
”Apple products would not be as good or secure if third parties can come into the system,” he said.
Apple shares closed down 44 cents at $114.63 Tuesday.

Top ten high value stocks; should investors buy, sell or hold?
Kshitij Anand, ECONOMICTIMES.COM Dec 3, 2014, 03.28PM IST

Blue Dart Express Ltd.
(It has been a breakout year…)
NEW DELHI: It has been a breakout year for the Indian markets with the Sensex and the Nifty both rallying over 30 per cent each so far in the year 2014.
After a strong rally seen so far in the year, analysts are convinced that the bull run is here to stay and the Indian markets will make record highs in the year 2015 as well, supported by revival in investment activity, bounce back in economic growth and further policy announcements by the Modi-led government.
Foreign investors have already affirmed their stance on the Indian markets, considering the fact that global money managers have already poured USD 16.5 billion into Indian stocks so far in the year 2014.
Riding on the momentum, many high value stocks have more than doubled so far this year - which brings us to our next question: Is it advisable to hold them or investors should rather book profits on rallies?
Analysts are of the view that some of these stocks are overvalued and booking profits would be the right strategy. "Do not hold any stock based on rumor or speculation," warn analysts.
"Investors should not hold any stock for long periods of time when we know that it is significantly overvalued. Many investors like to chase these stocks since they have generated huge returns in the last few quarters or years," says Dr. Vikas Gupta of Arthveda Fund Management Pvt Ltd.
"This is a speculation on their continuing to perform fundamentally. While the probability of that is high too, the risk is very great if the lesser chances of them missing their fundamental expectations materialize. Then the result on the portfolio will be disastrous," he adds.
Investors can look at booking profits in logistic stocks as the government is on the planning stage to utilize huge infrastructure of the India Post for e-com logistics.
"Investors should hold consumer stocks like Eicher, Nestle and MRF," says Siddharth Sedani, Vice President - Portfolio Management Service at Microsec Capital Ltd.
"PSUs like Tide Water Oil, which has removed a lot of bottlenecks from its systems and is thriving for global business through its European and Middle East arm, may fetch better returns in future as valuations are still relatively inexpensive compared to companies like Castrol," he adds.
Sedani is of the view that companies like Bosch may still outperform as new technology innovations may bring better pricing power for the company.
We have collated recommendations from various analysts on the top ten high value stocks, which have rallied up to 200% so far in the year 2014:
MRF: Can book profits
"MRF has posted strong quarterly results recently with operating margins increasing on the back of low raw material cost. Auto ancillary is expected to show strong growth going forward and much of this has been factored in the stock price already," says Kiran Kumar Kavikondala, Director & CEO, WealthRays
Securities.
"Currently MRF's P/E is seen at 18.55, which is higher than the industry P/E of 15.54. Investors can lighten their portfolio and can direct investment to its peers with better forward P/E," he adds.
 
Bosch: Can test 27000 mark in next 8-12 months
"It has multiplied exponentially in five years i.e. from roughly 2800 to over 19500 levels and still there's no sign of exhaustion. As per the projection technique, it can test the 27000 mark in the next 8-12 months," says Ajit Mishra, AVP - Equity Retail Research, Religare Securities Limited.
Tide Water Oil India Ltd: Accumulate the stock and retain in your portfolio
The stock at current price is trading at 9.59 P/E, with FY15E P/E of 16.3. Therefore accumulate decision is recommended. The stock can be retained in portfolio, the company has been expanding its global footprint and has strong operating margins, says Kavikondala of WealthRays Securities.
Eicher Motors: Maintain your long positions
The stock has been outperforming majority of its peer in the auto segment and steadily marching northward with every passing day. So, maintain your long positions, says Mishra of Religare Securities Ltd.
Page Industries Ltd: Valuations look slightly stretched
"The company has performed well in Q2, but much of it has been factored in and valuations are slightly stretched," says Kiran Kumar Kavikondala, Director & CEO, WealthRays Securities.
"Investors may trim their position and move into other stocks. With the current price of the stock FY15E P/E is expected at 51.95, which is lower than current P/E of 68.18," he adds.
Shree Cements Ltd: Can test Rs 14000 mark in coming months
"Though the majority of cement counters are in a consolidation phase, it's gradually inching upward. It can test the 14000 mark in the coming months," says Mishra of Religare Securities Limited.
Honeywell Auto: Hold the stock for further gains

Cong may back Insurance Bill; Max India up 9%Max India, Bajaj Finserv rally up to 9% on reports that Insurance Bill may sail through

(The Bill, proposed in August,…)
Insurance companies such as Max India, Reliance Capital, Bajaj Finserv and Exide Industries surged on Wednesday trade on reports that BJP and Congress are likely to reach an agreement on Insurance Bill in the ongoing Winter Session of Parliament.
The Bill, proposed in August, aims to lift the cap on foreign investment in insurance ventures from 26 per cent to 49 per cent.
"Insurance companies are now starved of capital and partners are not allowed to put money. Hence, a lot of financial restructuring is going on. If the Insurance bill is passed, it will have a positive impact on the company, particularly the ones where capital is a constraint", said BP Singh, Executive Director & CIO-Equities at Pramerica Mutual Fund.
Among insurance stocks , shares in Max India surged the most by 9 per cent to touch intraday high of Rs 407.80. At 12:53 pm, the stock was trading at Rs 401, up 7.19 per cent.
Reliance Capital spiked by over 4 per cent to touch intraday high of Rs 545.40. At 12:55, the stock traded at 542.50, up 4.26 per cent. Bajaj Finserv surged over 8 per cent to 1249.80 while Exide Industries was up nearly 2 per cent to Rs 177.30.

See Sensex @ 32 600 in  15 for sure: GoldmanGoldman Sachs overweight on Indian markets; see 15% upside in 2015

(Goldman Sachs joins the…)
NEW DELHI: Goldman Sachs has joined the bandwagon of other investment banks such as Citigroup and Morgan Stanley , which have reiterated their positive outlook for the Indian markets, and see over 15 per cent upside in the year 2015.
"Do we see this year's (2014) success story to continue in 2015? We think the answer is yes. We do not think it is going to go up 30 per cent like it did this year, but it could go up by 15 per cent sure," says Timothy Moe , Chief Asia Pacific Strategist, Goldman Sachs.
"There is a perfectly reasonable expectation driven by the fact we think earnings growth for both 2015 and 2016 will be strong. And, for India we think there will be cyclical recovery from a depressed level," he adds.
The global investment bank is overweight on Taiwan, China, India and Indonesia.
Even though several brokerages have downgraded corporate earnings for FY15 and FY16, leading market intermediaries like Citi, Morgan Stanley, UBS and Ambit Capital have said they expect the benchmark index, BSE Sensex , to touch the levels between 32,500 and 36,000 by December 2015, ET reported.
Moe thinks that India has the potential to record around 7 per cent growth rate probably in the next year, which looks very promising when compared with other emerging market economies.
To give an example, India is up over 30 per cent in US dollar terms and Korea is down over 10 per cent. So there is a wide disparity between the markets and the sectors.
"We are looking for growth to accelerate 5.6 per cent and then to 6.3 per cent in the next two years. So this is something which is probably one of the better cyclical recovery stories in the region," adds Moe.
MSCI Asia Pacific ex-Japan index was up about 3 per cent for the year - not a very good year overall. If we go deeper, we see a lot of disparity. There is a 40 percentage point difference between the best and the worst performing markets, explains Moe.
Commenting on the overall rate structure, Moe says the overall backdrop for the monetary environment will still be very accommodative and, therefore, very supportive of asset markets.
"However, it might change a bit as we are expecting the US to finally begin to raise its former policy rate in the third quarter of next year, specifically on September 17thwhen the FOMC meeting for that month lies," adds Moe.
He says that when the US Fed starts hiking rates, it will be a moderate 25 bps increment. "So we do not think this will be a major shock and should not be something the financial markets will be unduly concerned by," he adds.

02:25pm RBI comfortable with current account deficit
The Reserve Bank of India is "reasonably comfortable" with the current account deficit because of lower oil prices, deputy governor HR Khan said, after the country last week unexpectedly eased some rules on gold imports.
"We are reasonably comfortable from the current account point of view because of oil," Khan told reporters in the sidelines of an event in Mumbai.
"So taking all that into account, a view has been taken that we'll give up this 80:20 (rule on gold imports)," Khan told reporters.

KK Mohanty believes the scheme will be more effective at lower interest rates.
Post your opinion here
Halftime Report
The finance ministry seeks to extend the 5:25 scheme to all stalled infrastructure projects. The scheme is likely to help easing project and finance bottlenecks. It will also address issues related to the non-performing assets.
Speaking to CNBC-TV18, KK Mohanty, MD,  Gammon Infrastructure says the 5:25 scheme is a positive step for infra companies and will be more effective at lower interest rates.
According to him, interest rate of construction projects is currently around 12 percent. Post 5:25 scheme, investors can earn returns at the start of the project.
The company is planning to implement the scheme for its new projects.
Below is verbatim transcript of the interview:
Q: Are you already speaking to banks? How can the 5:25 rule impact a company like yours?
A: Due to this 5:25 rule, our performance is looking better. We are slightly looking better; we are putting all the hard work in this difficult time and trying to perform.
Q: I am not referring to your stock, I said power stock and infra stocks have been doing well.
A: This 5:25 will be an extremely good initiative for the infrastructure especially the public-private partnership (PPP) project.
This might be a little counter productive of 5:25 principle at this type of interest rate because major portion of the offside of the project will get into interest. This will be really useful when the interest rate comes to the single digit and the surplus cash is generated for the investor to get some upfront return on their investment.
Q: Wholesale rates have fallen a bit in the bond markets. What is the interest rate or average interest rate of your any average road project and if you were to recast that loan now or go into a take out, financing mode know what will be the interest rate?
A: Presently, our interest rate on construction projects is between 11-12 percent. After completion it might be between 10-11 percent and so it will be roughly 100 basis points.
Q: If you go for 5:25 what will be the new interest rate for the first five years?
A: The interest rate will not vary much. Might be 25 basis point maximum; interest rate will remain same. The point that I was making is at a 12 percent interest rate instead of that we take 25 years to pay the interest on the same principal outstanding rather than in 10 years then the major portion of offside of the project will get into interest servicing of the debt which will not be a very productive situation for giving return to the equity.
This will be an extremely good initiative on two counts; one, the upside of the project will go up and so, investor will get higher returns on his investment.
Two, in the initial stages also the investor can get some returns from his investment because there is only interest outflow and there is no principal repayment.
Q: Are you likely to take advantage of this any time now or will you wait for a year from now if interest rates were to fall?
A: As a first step one of our project which is under revalidation, we are trying to take a 5:25 advantage in that and that is how it is working.
Q: Is that a new project?
A: Yes, we are just starting the project.
Q: Are banks very happy, are they very proactive in looking at the 5:25 way of financing?
A: The knowledgeable banks like  IDBI and all are looking at this positively.
Q: If for an older project the 5:25 looks attractive one year down the line when probably interest rates will be lower or at least market rates will be lower by about 75 basis points let us assume you come into a 10 percent financing bracket at that time if banks have to provide for the notional loss will it be useful?
A: The Governor of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was telling this is the age old practice in the financing sector. It is called an early warning signal.
If a loan is showing early signs of stress, there has to be early warning signal and provision provided for and so, when the actual loss happens it is not a shocker or not a surprise.
This is an age old practice and it might be different financial institution, financial companies camouflaging it by a different way or side tracking it so what he is talking about a very prudent norm in the financing where a early warning signal is recorded and some corrective measure or provisioning is there so that when the actual impact of the incidence of the transaction come in there is no surprise in that.
Q: If one of your current loans where to go in the 5:25 mode will banks have to take a hit? Will the financing cost fall and therefore that much has to be marked as a net present value (NPV) loss?
A: I do not think there will be any difference on this 5:25 case. 5:25 case will make difference between two situations; one, if an annuity project is there 5:25 at this type of interest rate may not help a lot because in annuity project the equity return itself is in the range of 12-13 percent.
If you are playing 12 percent interest, you are taking away the return on the equity side.
In a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) project, in a toll project, if the return is around 14-15 percent it might help slightly.
However, the real effect of this will come when the interest rates comes to single digit for infrastructure and 5:25 formula is implemented so that the investors will be very happy to invest into these projects because they will have two advantages.
They will have a better return on their investment and also they can also get an upfront return or some dividend on their investment which is not likely today because in the past 8-10 years it is not practically possible to give any return on equity in a PPP project.
Gammon Infra stock price
On December 10, 2014, Gammon Infrastructure Projects closed at Rs 14.20, up Rs 0.00, or 0.00 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 20.85 and the 52-week low was Rs 6.60.
The latest book value of the company is Rs 7.14 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company was 1.99.

Naresh Goyal-controlled Jet Airways  gained about 1 percent in afternoon trading after it said it had begun to formally discontinue its low-cast arm JetLite and would roll out full service products across all routes on its domestic network.
The move is part of the restructuring process the carrier had announced earlier this year through which it is targeting returning to profitability by 2017.
Jet has not turned over a rupee in profit over each of the past seven financial years, with consolidated losses climbing to Rs 4,128 crore in 2014 while debt ballooned to Rs 8,714 crore.
Indian airline firms have struggled in recent years amid a weak operating environment, high operational costs such as with respect to fuel and airport charges and, yet, full-blooded competition in which players often resort to pricing wars to capture market share but not necessarily profits.
Jet, which earlier entered into a stake sale agreement with Abu Dhabi-based Etihad, is looking to expand its overseas network while streamlining its domestic network, which has incurred heavy losses.

TMC continues to attack Modi government, raise issue of fuel pricing in Parliament

New Delhi: The Trinamool Congress on Wednesday continued with its attack on the Narendra Modi government and has targeted the Centre on fuel prices. TMC MPs were protesting outside Parliament holding banners against the price hike.
The government has hiked excise duty on petrol by Rs 2.25 per litre and diesel by Rs 1 per litre without raising retail prices. The government is expected to raise Rs 4000 crore from the rise in excise duty.
The TMC, however, slammed the government for not transferring the benefit of the hike to consumers under the government's promise to de-control prices.
#winter session #parliament #tmc #bjp
Crude prices have fallen by 40 per cent since June but petrol prices have just been cut by 11 per cent and diesel prices by 8 per cent. The excise duty on petrol and diesel have been hiked twice in three weeks which means Rs 12,000 crore of additional revenue to the government. The excise duty has been hiked to help the Finance Minister come near 4.1 per cent fiscal deficit target.
The government has defended its move saying that excise duty gives cushion to government to avoid a hike when prices go up.
Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said, "We had passed on some relief to the consumer when the global price fell. Now we have raised the excise duty because we didn't have profits. The previous government have left our coffers empty and we didn't have a choice."
The Modi government had earlier came under the attack of TMC on the issue of black money, BJP President Amit Shah's alleged links with the Sahara group, controversial remarks by MoS Niranjan Jyoti.

2002 hit-and-run case: Experts tell court alcohol content found in Salman Khan s blood was higher than normal45
0
Mumbai: Bollywood actor Salman Khan's blood had alcohol content after he was made to undergo a test in the 2002 hit-and-run case, according to a chemical analysis expert who testified in a Mumbai Sessions Court on Wednesday. The expert claimed in the court that the alcohol content found in Salman Khan's blood was higher than normal. "I also conducted the Morpholin test which showed positive results. 62 MG of Ethylalcohol was found in Salman's blood," said the expert.
Earlier in the 2002 hit-and-run case, a witness identified the actor during the previous hearing and had told the court that he saw Salman taking the driver's seat. The witness, a JW Mariott parking assistant, had said that the actor got behind the wheel of the landcruiser at the hotel. He had also stated that Salman tipped him Rs 500 adding that he was accompanied by 3 friends.
The hit and run incident dates back to 2002 in which one person had died while four others had been injured. Salman was charged with an additional charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder that is liable for a 10-year sentence.
#2002 hit and run case #salman khan #ethylalcohol #blood test
There have been several twists and turns in the 12-year hit and run case in the past too. In August, 2014, the Mumbai Police had told the court that the case diary has gone missing in addition to 55 of the 63 case related documents which were already missing.
The court has asked the prosecution to file a report on the next plan of action. The court has also directed the former investigating officer, Kisan Shengal, to be present at the next hearing scheduled on September 12.

Kenya security chiefs ousted after fresh ShebabkillingsBy: Press Trust of India | Nairobi (kenya) |
Posted: December 3, 2014 3:19 pm | Updated: December 3, 2014 3:26 pm
Kenya’s interior minister and police chief have been removed from their posts, hours after Somalia’s Shebaab rebels carried out a fresh massacre in the northeast of the country.
In a televised address to the nation yesterday, President Uhuru Kenyatta also vowed his security forces will “intensify the war on terrorism” after a spate of killings in the country by the Al-Qaeda-affiliated insurgents.
A group of Shebab rebels stormed into a quarry near the border town of Mandera shortly after midnight, and police and officials said they weeded out 36 non-Muslims for execution.
Those labourers not shot as they slept were placed in lines in the dusty quarry, with insurgents shooting most in the head but also beheading others.
Their bodies were flown to Nairobi later on Monday on a military transport plane.
The Shebab said in a statement their latest cross-border attack was fresh retaliation for Kenya’s 2011 invasion and continued presence in Somalia, as well as its treatment of Muslims in the troubled port city of Mombasa.
The assault came just over a week after the Shabaab executed 28 people grabbed from a bus travelling from Mandera, on the frontier between Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia.
Kenyatta, however, said Kenyan troops would stay put in Somalia, where they are now part of an African Union force battling the Shebab and supporting the war-torn country’s internationally-backed government.
“This is a war and a war that we must win, we must win it together,” he said. “The ultimate aim of this atrocious campaign is to create an extremist caliphate.”
He called the Shabaab “deranged animals” who had killed more than 800 people in attacks inside Kenya, including 500 civilians and 300 security officers.
“We will not flinch or relent in the war against terrorism in our country and our region. We shall continue to inflict painful casualties on these terrorists until we secure our country and region.”
The Kenyan government has been under fire since last year’s Shebab attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi, in which at least 67 people were killed in a siege involving just four gunmen and which lasted four days.
Sending condolences to the families of the latest victims, the United States said there was “no excuse or justification for this kind of terrorist violence.”
Washington had been “very clear about the threat posed” by Shebab, said State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf, adding US officials “vigorously condemn” the group’s “continued cowardly, brutal targeting of civilians.”
Worries over internal security mounted when Shebab rebels massacred 100 people in a string of raids against villages in the Lamu region on the Kenyan coast in June and July.

Bomb blast hits UN convoy near Mogadishu airport  3deadBy: Associated Press | Mogadishu |

Jessica Alba gets in fighting shape for newfilmBy: Press Trust of India | Los Angeles |
Posted: December 3, 2014 2:58 pm
Actress Jessica Alba has been working hard to get in shape for upcoming film ‘Mechanic: Resurrection’, says her fitness trainer Michael Margolin. The 33-year-old mother of two works out two to four times a week for hour-long sessions that focus on high-intensity intervals, reported People magazine.
She is training under Margolin, co-founder of Krav Maga, the Israeli military’s official system of hand-to-hand combat. “It gets you in good shape and you’re also learning a skill. It’s an effective workout because of the kicking and punching with the resistance of another individual,” Margolin said.
Alba works out with Margolin two to four times a week for hour-long sessions that focus on high-intensity interval training. “We start with a warm-up, and then we do intervals. We do a lot of mitt work where she’s kicking and punching various targets as strong as she can for a period of time, and then she rests for a period of time. We also mix in medicine balls, kettle bells and some light weights,” Margolin added.

Book review: Is Ideal Wife an ideal read For Bollywood masala lovers  itisWritten by Parmita Uniyal | New Delhi |
Posted: December 3, 2014 2:58 pm | Updated: December 3, 2014 3:23 pm
A film works only because of three reasons – entertainment, entertainment and entertainment. Could this be true for Books also?
The lines from Vidya Balan’s masala blockbuster The Dirty Picture was the sole motivation for short filmmaker Sanjay Grover, who turned author with An Ideal Wife on his nephew’s request. He admits he can “barely write proper English” in the Preface of the book.
You pretty much make up your mind whether to go ahead with the book or not after reading the Preface. And if you do decide to read the book, you have no false expectations. The book is exactly what it promises in the preface – entertainment, entertainment and entertainment. Don’t expect anything more than that. You’d be in for disappointment.
The colloquial language, filmy twists & turns and the treatment of the book appalls you in the beginning, but then to your own surprise, you start to enjoy the flow of the book (only if you could keep your brain in a freezer). If at all we can compare this book with anything, it would be with Bollywood’s 100-cr mindless blockbusters.
Bollywood masala fans can continue reading. Literature lovers can look the other way.
This is what the book is about.
Happy-go-lucky, hardworking, successful, helpful and honest to the core, the protagonist of the book Sameer is looking for an Ideal Wife. Good at winning bets, this time Sameer finds himself in a sticky situation when he makes a bet with his friend that he would marry his ideal woman within a year. The list of his ideal wife’s qualities is long and the time is running out. This would be the first bet Sameer might lose and it’s killing him. No more happy, Sameer even starts to avoid work. He even turns a blind eye to people who were used to his helpful ways. A Dwarf God in God’s kingdom is perturbed to see his follower falling on the wrong path and decides to help him by finding his Ideal Wife. The trick? Sameer’s Ideal Wife doesn’t exist on Earth.
If you are a sucker for logicless yet entertaining stories, this is an ideal read for you.

SAIL share sale likely on December 5; stock cracks over 5%
ECONOMICTIMES.COM Dec 3, 2014, 03.21PM IST

The disinvestment of 5 per cent stake in state-run Steel Authority of India is likely to happen on December 5 (Friday), says ET Now quoting sources.
This would be the government's first disinvestment in the current financial year (FY15).
The stock took a tumble on the Street after the news came in. It slipped as much as 5.09 per cent.
At 3:09 pm, the stock was trading at Rs 85.50; down 4.84 per cent.
The sale of 5 per cent stake, or about 20.65 crore shares , of the steel maker at the current market price of Rs 85.45 apiece would fetch the exchequer around Rs 1,764.54 crore.
Domestic roadshows for the issue were held in Mumbai and Chennai in September. Two teams were sent to meet overseas investors. While one visited London, New York and Boston, the other solicited participation of investors based in Singapore and Hong Kong.
Apart from SAIL , Coal India , NHPC , PFC and REC are on the block among others. The government has been using the OFS route for disinvestment of PSUs.
The Cabinet had in July 2012 approved a 10.82 per cent stake sale in the country's largest steel maker. Accordingly, the first tranche of disinvestment of 5.82 per cent was done in March 2013.
Retail investors would be offered an additional incentive of an increased investment quota as well as discount to the issue price, which would be announced a day before the OFS. The government might announce the issue date two days prior to the OFS.
Market regulator Sebi had in January, 2013 permitted the promoters of top 100 companies to use the auction route or OFS route to dilute stake in listed companies. It also permitted OFS in those PSUs which were to meet the minimum 25 per cent public holding norm.

Top 10 high value stocks that returned up to 201%; are they a buy now What experts sayYou are here: Home > Collections > Stocks
Top ten high value stocks; should investors buy, sell or hold?
Kshitij Anand, ECONOMICTIMES.COM Dec 3, 2014, 03.28PM IST

Blue Dart Express Ltd.
(It has been a breakout year…)
NEW DELHI: It has been a breakout year for the Indian markets with the Sensex and the Nifty both rallying over 30 per cent each so far in the year 2014.
After a strong rally seen so far in the year, analysts are convinced that the bull run is here to stay and the Indian markets will make record highs in the year 2015 as well, supported by revival in investment activity, bounce back in economic growth and further policy announcements by the Modi-led government.
Foreign investors have already affirmed their stance on the Indian markets, considering the fact that global money managers have already poured USD 16.5 billion into Indian stocks so far in the year 2014.
Riding on the momentum, many high value stocks have more than doubled so far this year - which brings us to our next question: Is it advisable to hold them or investors should rather book profits on rallies?
Analysts are of the view that some of these stocks are overvalued and booking profits would be the right strategy. "Do not hold any stock based on rumor or speculation," warn analysts.
"Investors should not hold any stock for long periods of time when we know that it is significantly overvalued. Many investors like to chase these stocks since they have generated huge returns in the last few quarters or years," says Dr. Vikas Gupta of Arthveda Fund Management Pvt Ltd.
"This is a speculation on their continuing to perform fundamentally. While the probability of that is high too, the risk is very great if the lesser chances of them missing their fundamental expectations materialize. Then the result on the portfolio will be disastrous," he adds.
Investors can look at booking profits in logistic stocks as the government is on the planning stage to utilize huge infrastructure of the India Post for e-com logistics.
"Investors should hold consumer stocks like Eicher, Nestle and MRF," says Siddharth Sedani, Vice President - Portfolio Management Service at Microsec Capital Ltd.
"PSUs like Tide Water Oil, which has removed a lot of bottlenecks from its systems and is thriving for global business through its European and Middle East arm, may fetch better returns in future as valuations are still relatively inexpensive compared to companies like Castrol," he adds.
Sedani is of the view that companies like Bosch may still outperform as new technology innovations may bring better pricing power for the company.
We have collated recommendations from various analysts on the top ten high value stocks, which have rallied up to 200% so far in the year 2014:
MRF: Can book profits
"MRF has posted strong quarterly results recently with operating margins increasing on the back of low raw material cost. Auto ancillary is expected to show strong growth going forward and much of this has been factored in the stock price already," says Kiran Kumar Kavikondala, Director & CEO, WealthRays
Securities.
"Currently MRF's P/E is seen at 18.55, which is higher than the industry P/E of 15.54. Investors can lighten their portfolio and can direct investment to its peers with better forward P/E," he adds.
 
Bosch: Can test 27000 mark in next 8-12 months
"It has multiplied exponentially in five years i.e. from roughly 2800 to over 19500 levels and still there's no sign of exhaustion. As per the projection technique, it can test the 27000 mark in the next 8-12 months," says Ajit Mishra, AVP - Equity Retail Research, Religare Securities Limited.
Tide Water Oil India Ltd: Accumulate the stock and retain in your portfolio
The stock at current price is trading at 9.59 P/E, with FY15E P/E of 16.3. Therefore accumulate decision is recommended. The stock can be retained in portfolio, the company has been expanding its global footprint and has strong operating margins, says Kavikondala of WealthRays Securities.
Eicher Motors: Maintain your long positions
The stock has been outperforming majority of its peer in the auto segment and steadily marching northward with every passing day. So, maintain your long positions, says Mishra of Religare Securities Ltd.
Page Industries Ltd: Valuations look slightly stretched
"The company has performed well in Q2, but much of it has been factored in and valuations are slightly stretched," says Kiran Kumar Kavikondala, Director & CEO, WealthRays Securities.
"Investors may trim their position and move into other stocks. With the current price of the stock FY15E P/E is expected at 51.95, which is lower than current P/E of 68.18," he adds.
Shree Cements Ltd: Can test Rs 14000 mark in coming months
"Though the majority of cement counters are in a consolidation phase, it's gradually inching upward. It can test the 14000 mark in the coming months," says Mishra of Religare Securities Limited.
Honeywell Auto: Hold the stock for further gains

To exit CDR by FY15-end  repay debt in 2yrs: Indo Count01:30 pm
With the textile sector seeing green shoots backed by stable raw material prices and growth in exports, companies such as Indo Count Industries  are proposing an exit from the corporate debt restructuring (CDR) mechanism they had entered into a few years ago.
Indo Count, a bed linen and towel manufacturer, is considering exiting the CDR mechanism by the end of this fiscal. Over the time, it has reduced debt to Rs 110 crore from Rs 280 crore plus, says company ED Kailash R Lalpuria in an interview to CNBC-TV18.
Going ahead, Indo Count hopes to pay back debt and finance working capital through accruals within two years, he adds.
Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview:
Q: It has been a roller coaster ride and I believe that in Q3 i.e. the current quarter, you are looking to get out of that CDR, progress on track and what about the promoters? They have been hiking stake in compliance with the CDR regulations but will you all be looking to hike stake further from these levels?
A: Yes we are exiting the CDR and we are discussing with our bankers currently and by this financial year end we should be able to exit the CDR. So it removes the constraints for our growth and provide us an impetus for good image of our company because when we went into CDR, everybody had written us off.
Now the promoter’s stake got increased because it was for us to bring in the equity which was insisted on by our banker and we had necessary approvals from the bankers to increase our stake as an equity contribution for whatever capex which we did in order to debottleneck our capacities. So we had to infuse equity in order to build in this capex over a period of two years. So that is the reason the capex got increased from the levels which you were talking about.
Q: Can you give us a sense in terms of what the total debt figures stand at for the company and how much would you like to reduce it by and how much have you reduced it by since the time you entered CDR as well?
A: See when we went into CDR we had a total debt of around Rs 280 crore plus. Thereafter we have reduced gradually our debt by making repayments to the bankers on time. As on date, our long-term debt is around Rs 110 crore which we intend to pay back in the next two years time and our working capital is around Rs 200 crore plus. So fairly we have small capital like base, we are repaying on time, and we intend to do so in the coming years because we have decent internal accruals in the company. So we intend to pay back the debt and use some of our reserves in the working capital in the times to come.
Q: The first half of this year has been quite good for you all. What is the outlook for this year itself, are you going to deliver a revenue growth of around 10-15 percent or thereabouts and also are margins at 16.6 percent sustainable? Are you going to do better than that?
A: Yes, we are going to maintain our topline and bottomline both. We intend to do so and we are working hard towards it. We are able to utilise our capacities upto 90 percent. We have currently a capacity of 45 million meters that we are utilising well and we are growing into other product mix and clientele mix and we are also enhancing our geographical reach by opening up offices in the UK as well as Australia to tap new markets. So that will bring in the growth for the company both in top-line and bottom-line.

Buy SKS Microfinance  Petronet LNG  BHEL: Sukhani02:30 pm
Sudarshan Sukhani of s2analytics.com told CNBC-TV18, " SKS Microfinance has reversed back from a long bear market into a clear uptrend, a small dip in SKS Microfinance seems to be getting over and the prices again starts moving up. It’s a steady upmove, so we are buying a dip here."
"We have Petronet LNG , almost the same pattern. It had a sharp correction and that correction is probably finished because prices have resumed their upmove. So look at Petronet LNG," he said.
" Bharat Heavy Electricals (BHEL) is moving up and after a one day correction it took three days to revive and today it’s crossing the earlier high that it made four-five days ago. So, one day correction was just a correction. It is amazing and I do not know why it is going up but on the charts if it’s good then I would be a buyer."

Sailing to Agra on Yamuna to be a reality soon: GadkariSailing to Agra on Yamuna to be a reality soon: Gadkari
PTI

New Delhi, Dec 3:  
People will soon be able to go to Agra sailing on the Yamuna as the Centre has sought help from the Netherlands Government for the ambitious project that includes building barrages and water terminals on both sides of the river.
“Soon people can go to Agra via Delhi on the Yamuna...We will float a Cabinet note within 10 days to specify works for the project by our Ministry and the Delhi Government,” Road Transport, Highways and Shipping Minister Nitin Gadkari said.
“We will request Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to ensure special funds for the project,” he said.
After chairing a high-level meet to discuss the project, Gadkari said the Netherlands Government has agreed to come out with a technical report for the project, which includes specifications regarding construction of barrages and two water-terminals at both ends of the Yamuna.
“Netherlands has expertise in this. I had a talk with the Netherlands Ambassador. We have asked a Netherlands Government agency to prepare the project management report, including technical consultancy, for which they have agreed,” he said.
Gadkari said barrages would be constructed to ensure at least five metres water in the Yamuna round-the-year to ensure passenger and goods transportation on the waterways.
He added that more barrages would be constructed ahead of Wazirabad so that Delhi does not face a water crisis and if need be talks will be held with the Haryana government.
“We have already given a nod for sea-planes. We are allowing hovercrafts. We are constructing water terminals at both the ends of the Yamuna on the pattern of airports,” he said.
Unveiling the plans, Gadkari said the Delhi Development Authority will beautify the riverbanks while the Delhi Jal Board will prevent effluents from being released in the Yamuna.
Officials of the Ministry of Shipping in consultation with the Delhi Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung will integrate the scheme, he said.
Gadkari said his ministry has accorded the highest priority to development of waterways in the country, which has been “sadly” ignored so far with the country’s goods and passenger transport through the mode at barely 0.5 per cent of the total transport in comparison to China, where the percentage was 20 per cent.
Stress is being given to waterways from Varanasi to Kolkata and from Delhi to Agra now, in addition to the existing five waterways in the country, he said.

Sterling dips to 15-month low against dollarSterling dips to 15-month low against dollar
Reuters
Tweet
London, Dec 3:  
Sterling slipped towards a 15-month low against a buoyant dollar on Wednesday ahead of Finance Minister George Osborne’s half-yearly budget update and a survey on Britain’s services sector activity.
In the update, Osborne will try to convince investors that his plan for more spending cuts are more credible than the Opposition Labour Party’s less aggressive austerity proposals.
Analysts say that while the British economy has performed well in the past couple of years, public finances have not improved at the same pace and so borrowings are higher than last year.
“The Chancellor will have to substantially revise up borrowing projections for this year and for coming years. For the currency, it will signal further softness ahead as it will limit the scope for the Bank of England to raise rates anytime soon as fiscal policy remains comparatively tight,’’ FXPro chief economist, Simon Smith, said.
Sterling fell to $1.5620, close to Monday’s low of $1.5585 — the pound’s weakest since early September last year.
The pound was trading higher against the euro with the single currency down 0.2 percent at 79.02 pence. The euro was sold ahead of an European Central Bank meeting on Thursday. Policymakers in the euro zone are grappling with declining inflation expectations which are likely to prompt them to ease policy sooner rather than later.
Back in Britain, investors will eye the services sector purchasing managers’ index for cues. Data is due at 0930 GMT and is likely to show that the sector grew at a healthy pace.
The services industry makes up almost 80 per cent of the UK economy and its health is therefore an important consideration for the Bank of England when deciding when to raise interest rates.
UK rate forecasts have been pushed back dramatically over the past few months, with some now not expecting a hike until 2016. That pushback of expectations has weighed on the pound, sending it down almost 9 per cent since it hit a six-year high near $1.72 in July when many had expected a hike this year.

More than 300 companies to participate in textile tech show in MumbaiMore than 300 companies to participate in textile tech show in Mumbai

Coimbatore, Dec 3:  
The first Global Textile Technology & Engineering Show (GTTES) is scheduled to be held between January 20 and 22 at the Bombay Convention and Exhibition Centre, Mumbai.
This event, which is supported by the Heavy Industries Ministry (Government of India) and the Textile Department (Maharashtra Government) is expected to focus on the post-spinning segment and provide a one-stop solution for every business in the textile sector.
Organised by India ITME Society (International Textile Machinery Exhibitions), GTTES 2015, according to ITME Society treasurer S Hari Shankar, would be a complementary show to the India ITME series, held once every four years.
“With the constant development of technology, we felt it would be appropriate to hold a complementary event between the ITME series,” said the Vice-Chairman of ITME Senthil Kumar, justifying the reason for organising such an event.
More than 300 exhibitors are expected at this event, with strong representation from countries such as China, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, the US and India. Seven companies from Coimbatore are also expected to participate, Hari Shankar said.
The organisers are planning a special session on the Government procurement process and information relating to subsidies available to SMEs.
“Notwithstanding the live demo during the expo, we have given exhibitors an opportunity to promote their brands and services online for three months in the run-up to the event. It is now on,” said Senthil Kumar.
Overseas delegations from Ethiopia, Sudan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Korea, Mozambique, Egypt, China, Taiwan and Sri Lanka are expected to visit GTTES 2015, he said.

Meda Pharma, Cipla sue Apotex over Dymista patents
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Dec 3:  
Sweden-based drug firm Meda Pharmaceuticals Inc and Cipla Ltd have “sued” Apotex Inc and Apotex Corp in Federal District Court in Delaware in US to enforce patents of its allergy drug ‘Dymista’.
In a BSE filing, Cipla said “they sued Apotex Inc and Apotex Corp in Federal District Court in Delaware to enforce the Orange—Book listed patents covering ‘Dymista’ Nasal Spray.”
The company added that it has sued Apotex Inc and Apotex Corp “in response to Apotex’s submission to the US FDA of an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), and accompanying Paragraph IV certification, seeking approval to market a generic version of Meda’s ‘Dymista’ prior to expiration of the ’Dymista’ patents.”
In June 2013, Cipla granted the global commercialisation rights for ‘Dymista’ to Meda AB except for certain geographies.
Commenting on the development, Meda CEO Dr JThomas Dierks said: “Meda will vigorously enforce the ‘Dymista’ patent rights against Apotex and any other company who challenges these patents.
“The Complaint was filed within 45 days of receiving Apotex’s Paragraph IV certification notice, thus triggering an automatic stay preventing the FDA from approving Apotex’s ANDA for 30 months from receipt of the notice, unless ordered otherwise by a district court, the Cipla said.
“Meda has the exclusive licences to US Patent Nos. 8,163,723 and 8,168,620 covering the ‘Dymista’ composition and its approved uses, which does not expire until 2026’,” it said.
Meda holds the New Drug Application (NDA) to manufacture and market Dymista in the US for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis.
Meda and Cipla are jointly represented by attorneys from Sterne, Kessler, Goldstein & Fox P.L.L.C. and Ashby & Geddes, PA.

RBI says  reasonably comfortable  with current account deficitRBI says 'reasonably comfortable' with current account deficit
Reuters
HR Khan, RBI Dy Governor (File photo)
Mumbai, Dec 3:  
The Reserve Bank of India is "reasonably comfortable" with the current account deficit because of lower oil prices, Deputy Governor HR Khan said on Wednesday, after the country last week unexpectedly eased some rules on gold imports.
"We are reasonably comfortable from the current account point of view because of oil," Khan told reporters in the sidelines of an event in Mumbai.
"So taking all that into account, a view has been taken that we'll give up this 80:20 (rule on gold imports)," Khan told reporters.
The Government on Friday scrapped a rule mandating traders to export 20 percent of all gold imported into the country - in what had been known as the 80:20 rule.
The government will soon announce the current account deficit for the July-September quarter.

Reserve Bank of India, Governor, Raghuram Rajan
We are very respectful of the Government’s views and try and accommodate them to the extent possible: Raghuram Rajan
Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan on Tuesday explained in detail on why there was no rate cut even as he held out hope that a cut could be a possibility early next year as inflation appears to be moderating. In an interaction with the media, Rajan elaborated on the monetary policy stance. Edited excerpts:
When can we expect a rate cut?
We are certainly seeing the disinflationary process, with global developments on the crude oil being positive for India. We want to get more certainty about the pace of the disinflationary process, get a little more sense of some developments on the fiscal front, etc. This is why the policy stance remains unchanged, we think that we are well set at this point but as the information comes in our sense is that if it (inflation trajectory) goes according to expectations then it will be towards monetary accommodation.
Also, as far as the new monetary policy framework goes, we are in discussion with the Government and we hope to finalise the framework shortly. The Government has indicated that it is comfortable in setting a four per cent inflation target (plus/minus two per cent) as suggested by a number of committees, including the Urjit Patel Committee, for inflation beyond 2016.
Will a new bankruptcy code help in recovering bad loans?
The judicial process is slow. There could be several entities to blame, including the fact that they do not have enough resources, there are not enough people in the tribunals, there may be multiple appeals all of which slow down the process. I do believe that in a situation where Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs) are collecting 13 per cent of the total outstanding in a year, we are not collecting enough.
The Government has said that it will set up more DRTs and Appellate Tribunals and give them more facilities. …I don’t think we need a more draconian law than the Sarfaesi Act. It is quite a tough act when implemented and we have to make sure that we pull out the impediments in its full implementation.
We do need an overall bankruptcy code. The Government is working on a code with eminent people on it. For now, improving the process of DRTs need to be focussed on.
Was there any pressure from the Finance Ministry to cut rates?
I think pressure is a very misused word. There is a healthy dialogue that goes on. The Finance Ministry realises that we are entrusted with the task of controlling inflation and creating sustainable growth. So we are not combatants, we are on the same side. Sometimes they have different views and we try and persuade each other of those views. We are very respectful of the Government’s views and we try and accommodate those views to the extent possible and then explain where we can’t and why we can’t.
What is the rationale for scrapping the 80:20 gold import scheme?
 We have said in the past that some of these actions put to place to deal with the (currency) volatility would be withdrawn. On the issue of gold, there was a healthy debate and amongst the various opinions, one was that we are in a much better position — the current account deficit is much lower now, and there were some distortions which were creating an un-level playing field. Some parties were taking advantage of it while others were obeying the rules of the game. Another school of thought was that let us be a bit more cautious. However, a decision was taken to scrap it now.

Nifty futures contract stuck in narrow bandNifty futures contract stuck in narrow band
Gurumurthy K
Tweet
December 3, 2014:  
Nifty December Futures (8,565) The Nifty futures contract is stuck in a narrow range between 8,545 and 8,580 today, within the broad 8,540-8,600 range it has been trading in so far this week.
The contract is currently poised at the middle of this range and there is a 50-50 chance of it moving in either direction from hereon. The immediate outlook is thus unclear.
Traders can stay on the sidelines for now and wait for a clear breakout on either side of the 8,540-8,600 range. This will provide clear signs of the next trend.
A breach of 8,600 will be bullish and can take the contract higher to 8,640. On the other hand, a break below 8,540 can drag the contract lower to 8,500.
Strategy: Stay out of the market until a clear signal emerges
Supports: 8,540, 8,500

Action will be taken against Yadav Singh once I-T dept submits report: AkhileshAction will be taken against Yadav Singh once I-T dept submits report: Akhilesh
Press Trust of India | Lucknow Dec 03, 2014 03:07 PM IST
Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav today said action will be taken against Noida Authority's engineer-in-chief Yadav Singh once the I-T department submits its report to the government.
"Action will be taken once the report is received from the agencies probing the matter," the minister said during a an event.
"These organisations are bigger than the government. Whatever the input is from I-T or enforcement directorate, the action will be taken when it comes to the knowledge of the government," he added stressing that the actions were always taken by the state government.
The Income Tax department conducted raid at the house of Kusumlata, wife of Noida authority engineer-in-chief Yadav Singh, and recovered Rs 12 lakh cash, two kg gold and diamond jewellery.
Kusumlata is Director of Meenu Creations, which manufactures designer clothers.
The raids were conducted in conenction with the sale of plots in Noida through bogus share-holdings.
Engineer-in-chief Yadav Singh's alleged role in misuse of his post to get land allotted is under scrutiny.

Prabhu assuages fears over privatisation of RailwaysPrabhu assuages fears over privatisation of Railways
Press Trust of India | Mumbai Dec 03, 2014 03:00 PM IST
Union Railways Minister Suresh Prabhu today said the Centre was seeking private capital investment in cash-strapped Railways to meet the resource crunch and it does not amount to privatisation as the Railways unions claim.
"We want to get private participation but that does not mean we want to privatise railway's operations," he said, addressing an Asia Society event through video conferencing.
Prabhu, who took over as the Railway Minister recently, said that some people, especially the unions, "do not understand" the difference between merely getting private capital and privatisation.
"There are unions who feel that Railways is going to be privatised, government will not own Railways anymore. Railways will continue to be an important, dominant part of India's social-economic culture and Government of India will make sure that we've proper trade-offs between private participation which can come through proper regulatory framework," he said, seeking to assuage the concerns.
Ever since the Narendra Modi-led government came to power, there has been a lot of talk on foreign and private investments in the Railways. The unions, who represent close to two million employees of the state-run transporter, have opposed such measures.
Recently, two of the unions also offered employees' provident fund deposits to be utilised for upgrading the rail network.
"If Railways do not have the resources, then we must allow private capital into Railways for betterment of country, railways, people who use railway services, those who run the services like the employees," Prabhu said.
He added that this will be a "win-win" situation which will benefit all the stakeholders, including the investors, passengers and most importantly the employees.
Prabhu said he wants to make Railways "vibrant, sustainable and an efficient effective business organisation" and promised that it will never let go of its agenda of doing social good.

Probe has so far not revealed any Saradha-terror link: GovtProbe has so far not revealed any Saradha-terror link: Govt
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Dec 03, 2014 03:00 PM IST
Investigation into the Saradha chit fund scam has so far not revealed any terror link with Bangladesh, Government said today, days after BJP had alleged such a connection.
"The investigation has so far not revealed any such transaction where money was routed to Bangladesh to fund terrorist activities," Minister of State for Personnel Jitendra Singh told the Lok Sabha in a written response.
However, addressing a rally in Kolkata on Sunday, BJP Chief Amit Shah had alleged that Saradha chit fund money was used in the October 2 Burdwan blast, which is being probed for link with Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) terror outfit.
"Saradha chit fund money was used in the Burdwan blast. The NIA is not being allowed to probe the blast properly. Hurdles are being created. It is being done in order to save TMC leaders who are involved in the blast," he had alleged, attacking the Trinamool Congress.
The Minister was asked whether the government has sought details of the probe into the Saradha chit fund scam after reports indicated that a part of the money was routed to Bangladesh to fund terror activities. Singh replied that government has not sought details of the probe.
To another question on whether the Saradha chief has admitted that he paid large sums to several people to influence the case in his favour, the minister today said "the matter is under investigation.

SI Reporter | Mumbai Dec 03, 2014 03:30 PM IST
Benchmark shares indices ended flat, amid choppy trades, as investors shifted focus to fundamentally sound shares in the broader market.
Provisionally, the Sensex ended up 13 points at 28,457 and the Nifty gained 14 points to close at 8,539.
_____________________________________________________________
(updated at 3.30 PM)
Benchmark indices have slipped in the negative territory as weakness in technology stocks and select financials along with Index heavyweight ITC capped gains.
At 2.30 PM, the Sensex is down 56 points at 28,388 and the Nifty lost 9 points to trade at 8,516.
The broader markets attracted investor interest in today’s trade. The mid-and small-cap indices are up 1.6%% each.
Meanwhile, activity in India's services sector expanded at its fastest rate in five months in November on new order flows, but hiring declined for the first time in four months, showed the widely-tracked HSBC purchasing managers' index (PMI) data released on Wednesday.
The index rose to 52.6 points in November against 50 in the previous month. A reading at 50 separates expansion (above 50) and contraction (below 50).
Back home, the rupee is trading at 61.89 compared with Tuesday's 61.88/89 close. Foreign institutional investors were net buyers in Indian equities worth Rs 107 crore on Tuesday, as per provisional stock exchange data.
The Reserve Bank of India is "reasonably comfortable" with the current account deficit because of lower oil prices, deputy governor H R Khan said on Wednesday, after the country last week unexpectedly eased some rules on gold imports.
Global Markets
The dollar marked a fresh seven-year high against the yen on Wednesday, which helped lift the Nikkei to a similar closing record, while oil prices recovered on news of a drop in US supply.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged down about 0.2%. But Japan's Nikkei stock average finished 0.3% higher, off its session highs but still closing at its highest level since July 2007.
European shares are trading higher in morning trade on Wednesday following the bullish trend set by markets in Asia and the U.S. CAC 40, FTSE and Dax are up between 0.1-0.3%.

BSE Oil & Gas index is the top gainer up 1.5% followed by Power, Capital Goods, Auto and Realty indices trading higher by 1% each. However, BSE IT and FMCG are down 0.3% each.
Oil and Gas major ONGC is the top gainer and is up over 4%. CLSA has a buy rating on ONGC as the brokerage believes the stock is pricing in an extremely high 93% subsidy burden. "The actual proportion is likely to be much lower and risk-reward appears attractive at current levels. ONGC is one of the cheapest global exploration & production names and our top play on reforms. Clarity on the subsidy formula should drive a rerating."
With oil prices coming down and the domestic prices of petrol and diesel are purely market determined, the subsidy burden would be near zero on these two items in the second half believe analysts. Its peers GAIL and RIL have gained over 1% each.
BHEL has gained around 3.5%. The company has announced the successful commissioning of India's first phase shifting transformer at Kothagudem Thermal Power station in Telangana. It is a significant breakthrough for BHEL which is the largest manufacturers of transformers in the country. L&T is trading with marginal gains.
Auto shares are trading mixed. M&M has recovered from yesterday's lows and is trading with a gain of more than 1%. Tata Motors has gained around 0.8% on news that its prized acquisition Jaguar Land Rover has started to build a plant in Brazil.

Uproar over Sadhvi s comments in LS  BJP refuses to yieldUproar over Sadhvi's comments in LS, BJP refuses to yield
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Dec 03, 2014 02:32 PM IST
With the opposition sticking to its demand for the resignation of Union minister Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti for making controversial remarks, there was pandemonium in the Lok Sabha for the second day today. 
Members from Congress, Trinamool Congress and RSP staged a walkout after government said that the matter should end as she has already apologised and the Prime Minister has disapproved of her comments.
With Prime Minister Narendra Modi present in the House after his week-long tours, opposition members vociferously pressed for a statement from him.
They questioned as to how he was allowing a minister, who uses such abusive language, to remain in his ministry.
BJP members countered strongly the opposition attack on Jyoti, who was present in the House.
Refusing to accept the opposition demand, Parliamentary Affairs Minister M Venkaiah Naidu said the matter has ended as she has already apologised and the Prime Minister has disapproved of her comments.
Countering the opposition, he referred to an incident during UPA rule when a central minister had allegedly made derogatory comments against Atal Bihari Vajpayee, which led the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to apologise in the House as the minister had refused to do so.
Naidu also reminded the protesting Trinamool Congress MPs about the reported remarks of party MP Tapas Pal at a public meeting where he had allegedly threatened CPI-M cadres and their family members with rape and violence.
Anguished over the government response, the opposition members including those from the Congress, TMC and Left staged a walkout.

Sebi asks Moneyworld to stop providing investment adviceSebi asks Moneyworld to stop providing investment advice
Press Trust of India | Mumbai Dec 03, 2014 02:42 PM IST
Sebi has directed Moneyworld Research to immediately stop providing investment advisory services with regard to the securities market and withdraw all the related advertisements.
Securities and Exchange Board of India said it prima facie found that Moneyworld Research and Advisory Pvt Ltd was offering trading tips to investors without obtaining requisite registration to act as an investment adviser.
Accordingly, through an interim order dated December 2, the market regulator has asked Moneyworld Research and its two directors to "cease and desist from acting as investment advisers and cease to solicit or undertake such activities or any other unregistered activity in the securities market, directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever".
They are also required "to immediately withdraw and remove all advertisements, representations, literatures, brochures, materials, publications, documents, websites etc in relation to their investment advisory or any unregistered activity in the securities market".
Sebi had closed the application of registration of Moneyworld Research in March, 2014, after it found several lapses on part of the entity.
However, it was noted that Moneyworld Research "solicited and induced" investors to deal in securities on the basis of their investment advices as well as guaranteeing returns even after the receipt of communication regarding the closure of their application for registration by Sebi on March 27, 2014.
The order observed that "subjecting the investment advisers to the statutory requirement of registration with Sebi is imperative for the protection of interests of investors and to safeguard the integrity of securities market".

Mid-cap indices hit record highMid-cap indices hit record high
SI Reporter | Mumbai Dec 03, 2014 02:12 PM IST
Shares of mid-cap companies back into action with the National Stock Exchange (NSE) CNX Mid-cap and the BSE S&P BSE Mid-cap indices have touched their respective record highs today.
At 1357 hours, CNX Mid-cap index was up 1.6% at 12,686 points, while S&P BSE Mid-cap index up 1.5% at 10,512. Both these indices hit a fresh record high of 12,700 and 10,528 respectively during intra-day deals.
MRF, TVS Motor Company, Bajaj Electricals, Max India, Natco Pharma, Sadbhav Engineering, Hatsun Agro Products, Engineers India, Indian Bank, Firstsource Solutions and Triveni Turbine have rallied between 5-12%.
Torrent Pharma, Bajaj Corp, Britannia Industries, Tata Chemicals, ING Vysya Bank, Havells India and Pfizer are among 15 stocks that hits record high during intra-day deal today.
According to analyst at Angel Broking, broader interest rates, including bond yields are likely to head around 100bps lower over the next year which would be positive for the investment cycle and GDP growth going forward.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) policy tone has clearly become far more dovish. In fact, the policy more or less indicates that by March-April 2015 itself, the RBI is likely to start cutting interest rates. Once stance changes, it will remain accommodative over sustained period of time, analyst said in a report.
RBI has kept key policy rates unchanged in its fifth bi-monthly policy review on Tuesday.
 

40 years ago...And now: Luna is dead  long live Chal Meri Luna!40 years ago...And now:: Luna is dead, long live Chal Meri Luna!
Viveat Susan Pinto | Mumbai Dec 03, 2014 08:52 PM IST
In the mid-1980s, the Luna moped from the Pune-based Kinetic Group was a popular brand on Indian roads – a low-cost two-wheeler that helped bicycle riders upgrade to a better mode of transport. It was sleek, stylish, sported a chrome body and had both a regular as well as a pedal kick start.  
Luna’s creator Arun Firodia says the moped tasted success quite quickly after its 1972 launch partly because it was marketed well and partly because there was nothing like it before. By the mid-1980s, Luna was amongst the leading players in its category, he says.
Yet, Firodia, son of Kinetic Group founder H K Firodia, yearned for more. Luna had been promoted in the 1970s and early 1980s as an affordable Indian product that could be used by anyone.
Besides conventional advertising featuring actors such as Shabana Azmi and Smita Patil in the 1970s, Firodia also plugged Luna at cricket matches and in schools. He gave the moped as a trophy to the “Man of the Match” winner at key domestic cricket tournaments and to topppers of the State Secondary School Certificate, or SSC board examination, in states such as Maharashtra where the Kinetic Group was based.
“Players such as Sandeep Patil, Chandrashekar and many others, who played national cricket in the 1970s, were winners of a Luna,” Firodia, now 70, who is chairman of the Kinetic Group, and the author of the recently-released book  Innovation on Two Wheels , says. The second part of this marketing exercise was placing the brand in films – something that Firodia knew would work. “In the Hindi film Gopichand Jasoos, released in 1982, actor Raj Kapoor, who plays the role of a private detective, can be seen riding a Luna,” Firodia, says. Luna featured in more films including Tamil movies.
For all this marketing effort, which helped propel the brand to the top spot in the first 12 or13 years of its existence, Firodia felt it was time to make the next leap in communication. “We wanted an ad campaign that wasn’t gender or caste-specific. It should talk to every customer located in any part of the country,” he said.
This wasn’t easy. Firodia had been working with a few local agencies (such as Blaze Advertising in Mumbai and Tom & Day in Pune) to market the Luna. “Blaze had produced some of film-maker Shyam Benegal’s feature films and was also big in the cinema advertising space. So we used them during the 1970s. In the 1980s, we used Tom & Day for our advertising work,” Firodia says.
But the need for a stand-out ad campaign is what prompted Firodia to appoint ad agency Ogilvy & Mather (around 1984/85) to work on Luna and found himself dealing with a young copywriter called Piyush Pandey. “This was his [Pandey’s] first assignment and we found him very down-to-earth and connected to his roots. He wasn’t scared to think in Indian terms,” he says.
“Characters such as Ram Murari, a government employee, Ravi Kumar, a trader, and Radha, a medical student, who were part of the campaign, were people viewers could relate to. They had issues of time management, wanted to strike a work-life balance and at the same time desired to excel in life, academics and business. We put Luna into these situations and showed how these characters could achieve their dreams with a little help from the moped. It worked with consumers,” Firodia says.
For the workhorse that Luna was positioned as the tagline Chal Meri Luna (or Come on, Luna in English) seemed apt. It was inspired from the popular children’s song Chal Mere Ghode Tick Tick Tick from the 1959 movie Chirag Kahan Roshni Kahan. “All the elements fell in place well – characters from everyday life, who had problems like any of us, a product that could help them achieve want they wanted and a tagline that was likeable and connected with our need to position Luna as a solutions provider,” says Firodia.
The Chal Meri Luna ad campaign, according to advertising experts, was a precursor to the 1990s wave of Indian advertising that used the local language and idiom to the hilt to communicate a brand message. Piyush Pandey and his creative team at O&M was at the centre of this new wave, bringing out ads for Fevicol and Asian Paints in the 1990s that celebrated life, culture and habits the Indian way.
“Before Luna, most ads in general on print or TV largely appealed to an elite, English-speaking audience and were too western in their tastes. In many respects, Chal Meri Luna broke barriers, making advertising accessible, allowing more people to enjoy it because it was in Hindi and the characters were eminently relatable,” says K V Sridhar, chief creative officer at digital agency Sapient Nitro.
Thanks to Chal Meri Luna, the brand extended its reign at the top for another decade. By the 1990s, the moped market was declining rapidly, overtaken by high-performance motor bikes. By the first decade of the current century, Kinetic had exited the moped market in India, and the Luna brand ceased to exist as a result. But for consumers of a certain age, Chal Meri Luna still endures.

Realisation  volume concerns weigh on NMDCRealisation and volume concerns weigh on NMDC
Ujjval Jauhari |  Dec 03, 2014 09:35 PM IST
The impact of weak international iron ore prices is now being felt by NMDC, India's largest iron ore producer. After holding prices for four months, NMDC cut prices of iron ore lumps, which has higher iron content, by Rs 200 a tonne for November to Rs 4,400 a tonne, while maintaining October price for fines, the inferior grade of the raw material, at Rs 3,160 a tonne. Analysts expect the company is likely to cut iron ore prices for December, too. Following fears of lower prices, the stock has given way, correcting about 20 per cent in one month to Rs 138 levels.
Till October-end, while NMDC was able to hold iron ore prices, the stock also managed to stay up. However, the fall in international prices led to NMDC prices becoming uncompetitive. In fact, imports are currently 23 per cent cheaper for Indian steel mills located near the coast. JSW Steel has increased its imports in the past few months. Analysts, however, feel Tata Steel has partly filled the void created by coastal steel mills. As import price heads towards $60 per dry tonne, according to analysts at Motilal Oswal Securities (MOSL), they expect NMDC to cut per tonne prices of lumps by Rs 1,100 to Rs 3,300 and fines by Rs 760 to Rs 2,400.
Estimates such as this have led to concerns on realisations. The international supplies of iron ore have continued to remain strong while demand has not caught up substantially. Analysts believe iron ore production cut from China has not been seen so far and Chinese mines have managed to keep their costs under control as well.
While declining iron ore price is a cause of concern for companies like NMDC, there are concerns on volumes, too, on the back of weak demand. Analysts at Religare feel expected off-take may not materialise from some key customers of NMDC and also there may be some delays in capacity expansions.
Analysts are cutting their price and realisation estimates and hence target price for NMDC. While analysts at Religare arrive at a DCF-based one-year target price of Rs 155, analysts at MOSL have target price of Rs 161 for the stock. For long-term investors though, the dip in share price offers a good opportunity to accumulate as NMDC is a very cash-rich company with vast iron ore reserves, good dividend history and importantly is integrating forward by setting up a steel plant which is to be completed in FY17.

Crude shock: All s not well for OMCsCrude shock: All's not well for OMCs
Malini Bhupta | Mumbai Dec 03, 2014 01:30 PM IST
Fall in crude prices is a big relief for India's state-owned oil and gas sector, as their subsidy burden would come down sharply. But the view on oil marketing companies isn't very positive in the coming year. While the oultlook for upstream companies like ONGC remains positive as its output is expected to go up, the consensus view on refiners and oil marketing companies is bearish.
CLSA has a buy rating on ONGC as the brokerage believes the stock is pricing in an extremely high 93% subsidy burden. "The actual proportion is likely to be much lower and risk-reward appears attractive at current levels. ONGC is one of the cheapest global exploration & production names and our top play on reforms. Clarity on the subsidy formula should drive a rerating." With oil prices coming down and the domestic prices of petrol and diesel are purely market determined, the subsidy burden would be near zero on these two items in the second half believe analysts.
Axis Capital too prefers ONGC to Oil India. The brokerage says despite OINL’s high leverage to crude realisation and gas prices, it prefers ONGC in long term due to ONGC’s broad-based production growth in the coming years.
However, the view on oil marketing companies remains not as optimistic as operational issues remain. Analysts have are more negative on HPCL as the company's return on capital employed has languished at  9% with no operational improvement over FY11-14, says Spark Capital.
Also, in terms of refining margins GRMs, the industry isn't looking promising as the differential between light and heavy crude has narrowed, which will impact the refining margins of Indian refiners. In the second quarter, all refineries saw a sequential decline in refining margins. IOC’s negative GRM of $2/bbl was a negative surprise. Analysts prefer BPCL primarily for its upstream portfolio. IIFL says BPCL continues to be top pick amongst the three OMCs owing to its prolific upstream portfolio.

Madura Lifestyle proposes greenfield textile unit in OdishaMadura Lifestyle proposes greenfield textile unit in Odisha
BS Reporter | Bhubaneswar Dec 03, 2014 08:31 PM IST
Madura Fashion & Lifestyle (MFL), an Aditya Birla Group enterprise, has proposed to set up a greenfield garment manufacturing unit in Odisha. It has sought 6-8 acres of developed land in Mancheswar industrial area in the city along with other incentive and concessions for putting up the facility.
MFL is the largest player in premium branded apparel segment known for brands like Allen Solly, Van Heusen, Louis Philippe and Peter England. The lifestyle player has lined up an investment of Rs 75 crore in three phases with an overall production capacity of 4.2 million pieces per annum for the Odisha unit.
Total manpower requirement is pegged at 4,600 in all the three phases. The company is keen to create 11 ancillary units around the proposed plant that include three washing units, three goods packaging units and five embroidery units. Madura has sought allotment of land at concessional rates, capital subsidy of 25 per cent on total investments made on the plant and an interest subsidy of five per cent on the overall investment.
The company has requested full waiver on VAT (value added tax) and central sales tax (CST) for eight years from the date of commencement of operation. It has also sought full reimbursement on entry tax on plant and machinery and capital goods and raw material inputs for production of finished goods.
“We are keenly looking at establishing our base for manufacturing and selling from the state of Odisha and meet the requirement of northern India market in future and developing in a phased manner a strong manufacturing and warehousing hub for MFL. We believe Odisha as a state has great potential for us to establish and develop our business due to availability of labour, stable socio political environment, good infrastructure and defined political and economic support for the growth of the industry in the state,” the company said in its proposal to the state government.
“Since this will be our first project in the state and being one of the early movers in setting up greenfield apparel garmenting unit, we are seeking active support from the state government towards infrastructure and incentives to make our investment attractive and financially viable,” it added.
In the first phase, MFL will pump in Rs 40 crore on the project to create a production capacity of two million pieces. The plant, in the first phase, is poised to generate sales of Rs 250 crore for the company. Currently, MFL's apparel manufacturing units produce about 15 million garments per annum.

Odisha wants Wipro to provide timeline for Bhubaneswar projectOdisha wants Wipro to provide timeline for Bhubaneswar project
BS Reporter | Bhubaneswar Dec 03, 2014 08:32 PM IST
Peeved with tardy progress of IT major Wipro’s Bhubaneswar project, the Odisha government has summoned the company CEO to meet the state IT minister by this month end and present a detail timeline and future plan of the company’s Development Centre here.
“Since Wipro is playing a major role in the IT sector of the country and associated with the government of Odisha, the minister (IT), Odisha would like to meet you personally at Bhubaneswar for discussion of the road map of Wipro for its growth at Bhubaneswar. I will be happy if you visit Bhubaneswar in the last week of December and appraise the minister (IT) on this matter,” Pradeep Jena, state IT secretary wrote to T K Kurien, chief executive officer, Wipro Ltd.
Even though Wipro’s Bhubaneswar Development Centre in the Infocity SEZ was set up in September, 2012, it is yet to attain the targeted operation scale. Last year, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, in a letter to company’s chairman Azim Premji, had sought the intervention of the latter for starting full-fledged operation at the Development Centre. In reply, Kurien had assured that Bhubaneswar Centre will be given the priority and construction of first G+10 block of the project will be completed soon to accommodate the next wave of new projects.
But no progress has been made on this front in last one year, Jena pointed out.
Due to the inordinate delay of the project, the state government is facing embarrassments from different corners including from Comptroller and Accountant General (CAG) for non-utilization of the land allotted to the company in SEZ.
Recently, the Wipro management had turned down a request by the state IT minister to meet Premji at Bangalore. The company had said Premji would be travelling out of Bangalore during the visit of the minister and other state officials to the city.
The state government is very keen to see Wipro flourishing its business in Odisha and establish as a key employment creator for the state in the IT/ITes (enabled services) sectors, Jena added.
It may be noted that the state government had allotted to Wipro 26 acres of land in 2005 to build five towers (G+10) for accommodating 11,000 technical associates.

LEDs to replace CFLs  bulbs in govt officesLEDs to replace CFLs, bulbs in govt offices
Sanjeeb Mukherjee | New Delhi Dec 03, 2014 01:03 PM IST
The next time you see LED lamps glowing in the corridors and rooms of central government ministries and departments in Lutyens’ Delhi, don’t be surprised.
The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) is learnt to have suggested in a recent communiqué that all government departments and their subordinate offices procure only LED lights and bulbs for lighting, and not CFLs or tube lights.
The rationale: Though costlier, LEDs consume less electricity and can prove more effective in the long run.
The communiqué, sources said, also cited studies showing LEDs were 25 per more efficient than CFLs, 23 per cent more efficient that tube lights and 80 per cent more efficient than incandescent lamps.
“Though the price of LEDs is higher than other light sources, their lifetime cost is much lower,” officials said.
LEDs’ high energy efficiency can be gauged from the fact that a nine-watt LED bulb gives the same amount of light output as a 12-watt CFL or a 60-watt normal bulb, the communiqué is said to have argued.
A few months ago, the government had embarked on a major cleanliness drive at all central government offices and buildings and disposed of tonnes of unused computer peripherals, cupboards and chairs.

Kotak Mahindra Bank has launched a money transfer application called KayPay that allows you to transfer money to people on your Facebook friend list without the need for their bank account details.
You need to have an account with any of the 28 banks that have Immediate Payment Service or IMPS: an instant interbank electronic fund transfer service.
To avail of the service, you need to register your bank account on KayPay using your Facebook credentials. You must also provide the Mobile Money Identifier (MMID), a seven-digit number code issued by a bank to their customers who have registered for mobile banking to avail of the IMPS.
Once registered, you can transfer funds to your Facebook friend after entering the one-time password sent on your mobile. If your friend is already registered under KayPay, the amount gets credited immediately to the account.
Your unregistered friend, however, will have to register the bank account in which they want to receive the money with Kaypay. You can transfer Rs 2,500 in a day and Rs 25,000 in a month. Kotak Mahindra Bank will not charge any fee for this service.

Alibaba to invest more in India  help start-ups: Jack MaBy: Press Trust of India | New Delhi |
Posted: November 26, 2014 3:31 pm | Updated: November 26, 2014 7:48 pm
Jack Ma, founder of the world’s biggest eCommerce firm Alibaba, today said he is keen to invest more in India and help technology entrepreneurs here.
Ma said Alibaba — whose IPO in September this year ranks as the world’s biggest at USD 25 billion — is already working with many businesses in India.
“I myself commit that we will invest more in India, work with Indian entrepreneurs, India technologists to improve the relationship of the two nations and to improve the great lives of human beings,” Ma said at a FICCI event here.
Praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his leadership, Ma said that it is the best time for both the countries to work together.
“I have heard the Prime Minister’s speech and it is very passionate and inspiring. As a businessman, I was inspired and moved by it. Both China and India can achieve a lot working together,” he added.
Terming India a nation of mobile phones, he said, this is a nation with which China can work together and it is a great opportunity for entrepreneurs of the two countries.
“There are large number of Indian businesses on our websites. We have over 4 lakh Chinese consumers buying Indian chocolates, spices and tea. I think India has more great products that can sell to China,” Ma said.
Globally, Alibaba will continue to work with small businesses, he said.
“Over the next three years, one of the key strategies for Alibaba is to globalise and to make sure that we can help more small businesses around the globe, use our services to do businesses,” he added.
Ma said that Internet is a young business for the young and India has a lot of young people.
“I was a teacher. Internet changed my life and I absolutely agree that India can be changed by Internet too. India is a great nation with so many young people. I strongly believe that Internet is a young business and a business of young people…,” he added.
Ma, the richest man in China with a fortune of about USD 24.4 billion, founded Alibaba in 1999 in Hangzhou, capital of east China’s Zhejiang Province.
According to research firm IDC, Alibaba is the world’s largest online and mobile commerce company by GMV (gross merchandise value) in 2013.
Its China retail marketplaces had 307 million annual active buyers for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, while mobile MAUs (monthly active users) grew to 217 million during the same period.

For Budget 2015-16  FinMin has no Plan panel to work withPer capita annual income increases in national capital
As the Budget exercise for 2015-16 gains speed, the finance ministry is trying to fill up for the lack of a Planning Commission.
For starters, the Budget circular 2015-16 that was issued by the finance ministry last month said Plan ceilings shall be communicated by the Budget division instead of the Planning Commission that earlier was responsible for it.
“At this stage of Budget discussions, the absence of the Planning Commission is not being felt. The role of the Plan Panel usually starts from January or February when the allocations are worked out,” said a senior government official, adding that the Planning Commission is still operational and staffed with officers who are working on various issues.
Sources said the expenditure department’s Plan finance division, which works on the Central Plan and state finances has also been filling in for the Planning Commission wherever required.
Traditionally, while the finance ministry works on the non-plan aspect relating to subsidies, interest payments and salaries and pensions in the Budget, it is the Planning Commission that reviews schemes and programmes of the various ministries and finalises the Plan spend to these agencies.
The gross budgetary support is decided in consultation by the two although the final say is with the Prime Minister.
Currently, the finance ministry has begun pre-Budget discussions and is finalising the Revised Estimates for 2014-15 with each government ministry and department.
“We are holding meetings twice a day to finalise these estimates. After this work on the Budget Estimate for 2015-16 will be started,” said the official, pointing out that the Plan panel was also absent during the preparations of the Union Budget 2014-15 that was presented by the NDA government in July.
A former finance secretary said the absence of the Planning Commission in the Budget exercise would make life much easier for the finance ministry. “Usually, there is a lot of to and fro between the two on what the gross budgetary support should be and is only finalised after inter mediation from the Prime Minister. This is likely to be avoided this year as the amount can be decided by the PM based on discussions with the finance ministry alone,” he said.
However, the Budget division has neither the manpower nor the tools to work out Plan allocation for each ministry, which is usually monitored by the Plan panel and finalised, he pointed out.

Centre raises doubts over Rajasthan labour reformsWritten by Surabhi | New Delhi |
Posted: November 27, 2014 1:11 am
Rajasthan may have initiated long-pending reforms in labour laws, but the Centre has said it is unclear whether the state has followed the international norms of consultation with trade unions for some of the amendments. “It is also not clear whether tripartite consultations have taken place as required under ILO Convention 144,” labour minister Bandaru Dattatreya informed Lok Sabha on Tuesday.
The minister was responding to a question on amendments by the Rajasthan government on retrenchment under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, and provisions to redefine the factory under the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970, and the Factories Act, 1948. The government of Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje was the first to begin overhauling India’s archaic labour laws in June this year aiming to lower the compliance burden on factories. The assembly enacted amendments to the Industrial Disputes Act, Factories Act and Contract Labour Act in August, which received Presidential assent earlier this month.
According to Convention 144 of the International Labour Organization, member nations must “ensure effective consultations … between representatives of the government, of employers and of workers”. India ratified the convention in 1978. Based on a representation, the ILO can take up the matter with a nation at its annual meeting, or the ILO director-general may seek an explanation.
A Rajasthan government official, however, said, tripartite consultations did take place but the trade unions did not agree to the provisions. “In such a situation, what can we do? Further, these unions just represent 5 per cent of the labour force and not all workers,” he said. Another state official added that such discussions were not mandatory under domestic law. “These amendments are now law, and are based on the suggestions of the Second National Commission on Labour,” he said.
AK Padmanabhan, president of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), said, “The Rajasthan government did not have any consultations with the trade unions … and neither has the Centre called us for any discussions.” Trade unions have also contended that doubling the number of workers in the definition of a factory under the Factories Act has pushed nearly 75 per cent of the estimated 7,622 factories in the state out of the purview of labour laws. Dattatreya told Lok Sabha the Centre had “no objection” to other amendments by the state.

India s winning leapStory
India's winning leap
A new growth approach that takes inspiration from India's past but must break new ground is what PwC terms as the 'Winning Leap'.
Shashank Tripathi        Edition: Dec 21, 2014
Shashank Tripathi, leader strategy, PwC India
The Indian economy, often derided for its slow pace of reforms, is reaching a point of breakthrough growth. While the last phase of growth was a result of government-led reforms in 1991, this phase is being launched through a much wider coalition of citizens, corporations, entrepreneurs, investors and the government.
India faces a number of obvious and some behind-the-curtain problems. Education, health, power, infrastructure are just some of the areas that suffer from lack of investment and imagination. But these very sectoral challenges can act as a call for solutions that can spur growth. However, the scale of solutions for a nation approaching 1.3 billion people, the complexity of a diverse culture and the need for time-bound outcomes calls for a new growth approach that takes inspiration from India's past but must break new ground. We [PwC] term the approach as the 'Winning Leap'.
The new phase of growth is being launched through a much wider coalition of citizens, corporations, entrepreneurs, investors and the government
Our research shows that if India is to aspire to be a $10-trillion economy, with a nine per cent GDP growth over the coming two decades, that economy will be radically different from today, with up to 40 per cent consisting of new solutions. In the case of health care, for instance, if India is to increase life expectancy at birth from 66 years currently to 80 over the coming two decades, it could do this by accelerating existing low-cost solutions, using home and preventive care, and using mHealth techniques. We term these Fierce Catchup, Significant Leap and Leapfrog Solutions, respectively. This will help deliver health-care that is both achievable and sustainable, saving $90 billion in investments. Similar winning leaps are possible in other sectors too.
IN PICTURES: India's Best CEOs 2014
The corporate sector and multinational companies in particular are still reacting slowly to these impending shifts. How do they build new capabilities that will allow them to shape these winning leaps in their respective sectors? Our research points to five key themes that will influence where and how they build new capabilities. The new customer will be far more empowered and informed relative to today, operating models will have to be more flexible, and resources and partnerships needed for the Winning Leap will draw upon non-traditional sources. The approach to innovation and R&D has to make a profound shift, and accountability, integrity and diversity has to be hewn into the organisation's DNA.
To create a $10 trillion economy by 2034, India will need approximately $34 trillion cumulative investment
The entrepreneurial sector has a symbiotic relationship with the corporate sector in creating and benefiting from these new solutions. The corporate sector needs to partner with entrepreneurs to create an innovation ecosystem that often is difficult to create within a large organisation. The government is also moving rapidly in improving the burden of starting and running a young company. A fundamental shift towards entrepreneurship is a key ingredient in creating new solutions and powering growth.
While many would like to confine the role of the government to facilitating and easing economic activity, our research throws up an important second task - building national platforms. The Winning Leap will only take place if we create strong digital and physical infrastructure over the coming two decades. This may require execution by the private sector, but the orchestration of these platforms requires the convening power of the government. The creation of the National Optical Fibre Network (NOFN) is one example of enabling infrastructure that can transform small town and rural areas if implemented with speed and precision.
However, the mindset shift required for the Winning Leap has to go beyond the corporate, entrepreneurial or government sector. It has to be powered by a much wider respect for enterprise, and a new way we think about our resources. Instead of looking at citizens as passive voters or employees, we need to consider them as innovators and entrepreneurs. Instead of looking at our middle class as a consuming class, we need to think of them as a producing class. Instead of focusing on a national narrative, we need to consider a state- and district-level narrative to decentralise economic activity. Given the highly connected world that is emerging around us, businesses need not start with the economic boundaries of India, their get-go thinking has to be global.
At the current [rate of] 5.8 per cent and even with a projected [GDP] growth of 6.4 per cent for next year, a nine per cent YoY growth seems dramatic
India's Winning Leap is not only critical for its citizens, but it also holds resonance for other growth markets. If 25 years ago the global debate between communism and capitalism ended with the thundering crash of the Berlin Wall, a new debate continues to rage on the developmental path for emerging economies. China, no doubt, has made enormous strides over the past 20 years, but for a number of countries aspiring for a democratic polity, this path is still suspect. India's Winning Leap, on the other hand, can showcase a democratic economic development process. Its stop-start economic development may be critiqued, but behind it lies the herculean task of carrying 800 million voters. This is quietly inspiring for other growth economies looking for a socio-political-economic development path powered by its citizens.
PROFILES: India's Gladiators
To create the $10 trillion economy by 2034, India will need approximately $34 trillion cumulative investment. But where and how this investment is directed will decide if the Winning Leap will materialise. Unless India reorients its approach to human, physical and above all intellectual capital, growth will be linear and pyrrhic as it will not improve productivity required to accelerate economic growth. Other roadblocks in physical security, energy scarcity, climate change can also come in the way of India's Winning Leap. The recent Ebola global scare and a weakening Chinese economy are examples of extraneous factors that could also slow down India's growth.
Growing at the current 5.8 percent GDP growth and even with a projected growth of 6.4 per cent for next year, a nine per cent year-on-year growth seems dramatic. However, if India is to produce the 240 million jobs that it needs over the next 20 years, anything less will simply not be enough. With a concerted effort, on the other hand, India can use this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take a growth path that is both radical and sustainable. This path needs to bridge the false choice between economic and human development goals. It outlines why India's Winning Leap will not only grow the economy radically, but also bring prosperity to its 1.5 billion citizens in 2034. Those of us lucky to live in these times will bear witness to the largest nation-building exercise attempted in human history.

Xiaomi Redmi Note 3G review: Note this before you buyWritten by Debashis Sarkar | New Delhi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 2:52 pm | Updated: December 3, 2014 1:22 pm
The Xiaomi Redmi Note is here and this phone too has an eye-popping spec sheet at a jaw-dropping price. However, before you line up virtually on Flipkart, note that this is a really large device and one that runs on the now dated Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean operating system. I played with the new Xiaomi phablet for five days before penning down this review.
Quick specs: 5.5-inch IPS display 720 x 1280 pixels | Android 4.3 OS with MIUI 5 | 1.7 GHz MediaTek MT 6592 octa-core CPU | Mali 450 GPU | 2GB RAM | 8GB internal memory expandable up to 32 GB | 13 MP rear camera | 5 MP front camera | Dual-SIM (regular SIM 3G+2G) | 3200 mAh battery
Box contents: Handset, USB cable and adapter.
Price: Rs 8,999
Design: The Redmi Note looks ordinary. After I unboxed the review unit, I was not sure this is something for which people will line up on Flipkart. However, at Rs 8,999, you really can’t expect more.
If you were lucky enough to get a glimpse of the previously launched Redmi 1S smartphone, then for you this phone will appear as an enlarged version of the same. For the rest, the Redmi Note will appear like just another smartphone made by any Indian brand.
The front face sports a 5.5-inch screen above three red coloured capacitive navigation buttons. On the top is a 5 MP camera and speaker. A white glossy plastic back cover hides two SIM card slots, a microSD slot and a removable 3,100 mAh battery inside.
The Redmi Note with a 5.5-inch display is obviously a large smartphone to carry. However, the rounded edge makes one-handed operability easy. Weighing 200 grams, the Redmi Note is a bit bulky too. The device is mostly made out of cheap glossy plastic but it feels solid in the hand.
Display: The Redmi Note sports a 5.5-inch 720p display with a pixel density of 267 ppi. The display is not Full HD but does a good job. It is clear and crisp. You shouldn’t have any reasons to complain about the display. The viewing angles are good. Outdoor visibility is surprising good at full brightness. At medium brightness, you will be able to operate the phone under direct sunlight without much difficulties.
Performance: The Redmi Note offers good performance at this price range. The octa-core MediaTek MT6592 (32 bit, frequency 728 ~ 1664 MHz) with Mali 450 GPU and 2GB RAM will not disappoint you at all. It scored a decent 31337 on AnTuTu Benchmark (v5.3 ). General performance of the phone was good. I did not witness any lags at all while opening apps or doing regular things. On the gaming front, the CPU again performs well. Overall, multimedia experience is good and will satisfy most. However, I witnessed a slight lag while watching movies through USB OTG. The phone does heats up while playing games, but this should not be a problem.
Picture gallery: Xiaomi Redmi Note
Software: The Redmi Note runs on Android 4.2.2 sugarcoated with MIUI 5. There is no official word as to when the device will be upgraded to Android 4.4 KitKat, if not Android 5.0 Lollipop. The MIUI 5 comes without any app drawer. So, everything is there on the home screen itself.
Android Wear is compatible with Android 4.3 or higher devices only. So, if you have any Android Wear-based device, it will not sync with the Redmi Note, at least now. On the app front, you will miss several new games, Quickoffice integration (which comes with KitKat) among several others. The MIUI 5 has a ‘Notes’ app, which seems like the only justification of the name Redmi Note.
The MIUI 5 makes Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean look better and easier too. The UI includes a Lite mode which makes it much easier for first time smartphone buyers and elderly non-techie users to use the phone.
For power users, Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean will be a big turn off. However, if you are not much into apps, then you can live with it and wait for an update. Note that majority of the Android users are still on Android 4.1 or 4.2 Jelly Bean.
Camera: This is one area Xiaomi has not compromised at all. For a phone priced at just Rs 8,999, I would say the camera is really good. It’s not the fastest but it will not disappoint you. The camera is capable of taking decent macro and HDR shots. Low light images without flash were surprisingly good. The 5 MP selfie camera is decent too.
Storage: The device offers around 6 GB of internal storage. MicroSD cards up to 32 GB are supported.
Connectivity: The smartphone comes with two regular SIM card slots. The first slot supports 3G while the Slot 2 supports only 2G networks. Overall, there is no issue with connectivity.
Picture gallery: Xiaomi Redmi Note
Battery: The 3100 mAh battery does a good job. The device easily lasts an entire day on normal usage. I managed to watch a 2.5-hour movie via USB OTG with just 16 per cent of battery life (medium brightness and data connection switched off). On the gaming front, two hours of continuous 3D gaming at full brightness and volume drained the battery from 75 per cent to 25 per cent. Overall, the battery life is good. However, the 3,100 mAh battery takes time to charge.
Verdict: The Xiaomi Redmi Note offers great value for money, no doubt. However, be sure about the size and obviously Android 4.2.2 OS, before buying. If you want a large-screened smartphone then this is the only option under Rs 10,000.

In race for govt bonds  FIIs pay huge premium at limitauctionDirect equity set to top FDs as biggest asset class in FY15: Report
Foreign institutional investors paid an unprecendented 68.3 basis points of premium to get hold of a slice of investment limit in government bonds on Monday.
The National Stock Exchange (NSE) auctioned investment limits worth R3,041 crore (around $500 million) in government debt to FIIs on Monday. The highest premium offered was 75 bps at the auction where 73 FIIs participated.
Government bond yields have fallen more than 40 bps in the last two months, which has made the scramble for acquiring them more intense at the auctions. Monday’s auction attracted bidding worth R7,224 crore (around $1.15 billion), more than double the amount up for grabs. FIIs have poured in a record $24.5 billion into Indian bonds so far in 2014, the highest ever seen since liberalisation. The bulk of the inflow has been in government bonds and, thus, investment limits hit the $25-billion cap in August. The Securities and Exchange Board of India has mandated that once 90% of investment limits are used, the rest would be auctioned.
In the previous auction, too, on November 10, the bidding from FIIs was aggressive enough. The cutoff price at that auction had been high at 53.50 bps. “Interest rates are expected to ease over the next six months, so FIIs want to get hold of risk-free government bonds,” said a bond trader at a foreign bank. Yields on the 10-year benchmark bond dropped to 8.06% on Monday from 8.48% in October as traders priced in policy rate cuts owing to a steady fall in retail inflation. Government bonds range in 8.05-9.50% band across tenures with the 10-year benchmark security at 8.06%. FIIs have been investing in corporate bonds too with the limit in government bonds near the cap of $25 billion. Investors have exhausted 57% of the $51 billion investment limit in corporate bonds.

Editorial: Good job ongoldSugar prices under pressure over Brazilian dumping
After months of suspense during which RBI was discussing further curbs on gold imports, the government did well to do away with the 80:20 curbs last week. As FE has pointed out before, the curbs, including the hiking of import duties, served no purpose. While India hiked duties from 4% in February 2012 all the way up to 8% in June 2013—in steps of 2% each—gold demand rose from 202 tonnes in Q1-2012 to 310 tonnes in Q2-2013 since the rise in global gold prices made the investment worth it despite the hike in import duties. Once gold prices started falling globally, a response to faster US GDP growth and the declining taper essentially, Indian demand also slowed—investment demand for gold, measured by the demand for gold bars and coins, has fallen from 64 tonnes in Q1-2012 to 42 tonnes in Q3-2014. Hiking import duties and putting in artificial curbs like the 80:20 rule only hiked the premium on gold prices in India, and even fuelled demand to beat what always looked like another impending import curb. With gold import curbs gone, news reports suggest de-hoarding of gold stocks is taking place. A 10% import duty, in this context, means that those who had bought gold before the duty hike spiral began in 2012 are getting a 10% premium over what they should normally have got. Take that away, and watch the price fall even more.
Despite the fall, however, India’s imports of gold are still very large at 639 tonnes in the last 12 months, and does cause a problem with the overall import burden. Crushing this demand, however, is no solution. Indian households traditionally buy gold for a variety of reasons; two important ones are the lack of know-your-customer (KYC) norms and the lack of viable investment options. With inflation running above even fixed deposit rates, where else were households expected to invest? Had the government come out with enough CPI-indexed inflation bonds for the retail sector, possibly the demand for gold would have fallen even earlier. Though Kisan Vikas Patras have been reviled as a hoard for black money, their easy KYC was certainly a factor in their popularity—to that extent, bringing them back is probably a good thing.

More sops for UP mills if sugar falls below Rs3 100Sugar prices under pressure over Brazilian dumping
The Uttar Pradesh government could soon announce a hike in incentives for sugar mills beyond R20 per quintal for cane purchases in the marketing year that started on October 1. The additional sop would be made available if average ex-factory prices of sugar and other cane by-products drop below certain levels, sources aware of the government’s thinking told FE.
As part of its measures to persuade cash-starved sugar mills to start cane crushing and avoid distress sales by farmers, the UP government last month decided to form a panel, headed by the chief secretary, to determine the exact subsidy amount beyond the R20 per quintal already announced.
Although UP has kept the state-advised price (SAP) for mills to puchase cane unchanged for a third straight year through 2014-15 at R280 per quintal, the SAP is still 27% higher than the benchmark price set by the central government.
As per the arrangements, UP mills now need to pay farmers R240 per quintal in the first tranche within 14 days of cane purchases this year.
A subsidy of R11.40 per quintal — including society commission, purchase tax and entry tax — will be offered on cane purchases and up to R8.60 will also be provided later if prices of sugar, molasses, bagasse and press mud fall below R3,100, R390, R167 and R26 per quintal, respectively, between October 1 and May 31.
Of the remaining R20 per quintal, the expert committee will decide how much of subsidy the government will provide and how much the mills have to bear in case the average prices of sugar and the other by-products decline below the above-mentioned benchmark levels during the October-May period, the sources said.
Last month, the UP government was forced to announce incentives after sugar mills had threatened to suspend operation in 2014-15, as returns from sugar sales had failed to match the “arbitrarily” high cane prices fixed by the state government.
Mills were yet to pay Rs 1,206 crore for cane purchases in 2013-14 as of November and only 23 of the 95 private mills in the state started operations by then, according to latest data. More mills are expected to start cane crushing in the coming days once their usual maintenance work is over. A dozen of the 23 co-operatives also started crushing until last Thursday.
Having incurred a loss of Rs 5.50 on sale of each kilogram of sugar last year, the Uttar Pradesh Sugar Mills Association had also served a notice to the state government conveying its inability to crush cane in 2014-15. It had said unless the state kept its last year’s promise of firming up a formula linking the price of cane to its by-products and offering a financial assistance of Rs 9 per quintal of cane, even clearing cane arrears of around Rs 5,000 crore this season would be a herculean task.
Mills in the state incurred losses to the tune of Rs 7,250 crore in the three years through 2013-14. Banks, after reluctantly agreeing to offer mills working capital loans in 2013-14 following assurances of relief by the state government, have again started refusing to provide loans, further complicating the situation for the industry.

Way to sustained growth is by fighting inflationWay to sustained growth is by fighting inflation, says Raghuram Rajan

Strongly refuting the charge of being against growth, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Raghuram Rajan said on Tuesday the way to sustainable growth was through moderating inflation.
"There is a major misconception in the industry that the RBI is not concerned about growth. The central bank is concerned about growth and the way to sustainable growth is to have a moderate inflation," Rajan told reporters in Mumbai after announcing the central bank's fifth bi-monthly policy review for the current fiscal.
"RBI wants the strongest growth for India that is possible. We're talking of years of sustainable growth for which you need to fight inflation," he added.
In line with expectations, the RBI on Tuesday decided to keep key interest rates unchanged. The apex bank kept the repo rate, or the interest that banks pay when they borrow money from the RBI to meet their short-term fund requirements, unchanged at 8 per cent.
Rajan said a change in the monetary policy at the current juncture is premature.
"There is still some uncertainty about the evolution of base effects in inflation, the strength of the on-going disinflationary impulses, the pace of change of the public's inflationary expectations, as well as the success of the government's efforts to hit deficit targets, the governor said.
When asked about a missed opportunity for a rate cut, Rajan said if the RBI were to cut rates now it would risk inflation down the line and the associated loss of credibility.
"We should be confident before we do it, or else you will have the same problem of high inflation again and again," he said.
The RBI has set a target of Consumer Price Index (CPI)-based retail inflation at 8 per cent by January 2015 and 6 per cent by January 2016.
Country's annual wholesale inflation rate dropped to its lowest level in five years to 1.77 per cent in October from 2.38 per cent in the previous month and 7.24 per cent for the like month of the previous year, official data showed on Friday.
What may have helped Rajan ward off pressure for a rate cut is that the country's factory output grew at 2.5 per cent in September showing that the slowdown in economic growth was not as bad as earlier feared.
American brokerage Morgan Stanley expects CPI inflation to dip to around 4.5 per cent in November 2014 before edging up to around 6.4 per cent in the first quarter of 2015 with the receding of the favourable base effect.
Analysts say the RBI governor remains wary of factors outside his control like volatile oil prices that has seen international crude oil prices slumping below $70 a barrel.
Rajan, who has said he will not hold rates for longer than needed, has hiked rates thrice in his 15-month tenure citing inflation as a major concern.

SpiceJet Cancellations Trigger Chaos At Airports
Mumbai: JSW Steel Ltd said on Tuesday it has "put on hold" building a steel plant in eastern India due to uncertainty in sourcing key raw materials such as iron ore and coal.
The country's third-largest steelmaker had planned to build a 10 million tonnes a year steel plant in West Bengal at an investment of Rs 35,000 crore ($5.66 billion).
The company cited a Supreme Court verdict in September that scrapped most coal extraction permits granted to companies over the last two decades, after ruling the allocation process as arbitrary and illegal.
"Besides iron ore linkage for this project, the recent cancellation of coal mining concessions has added further uncertainty," JSW said in a stock exchange filing.
Another steelmaker Jindal Steel and Power Ltd last month told Reuters it had shelved a $10 billion coal-to-diesel project after the court decision to scrap coalfields.

Government Hikes Excise Duty on Diesel  PetrolYou are here: Home Economy
Excise Duty on Petrol, Diesel Raised; No Impact on Prices
Press Trust of India | Updated On: December 02, 2014 17:05 (IST)
China December Industrial Activity Shrinks for First Time in 7 Months
New Delhi: The government on Tuesday raised excise duty on petrol by Rs 2.25 per litre and on diesel by Rs 1 a litre but retail pump rates will not be increased as oil firms decided to absorb the duty change for the time being.
The second excise duty hike in three weeks will help raise an additional Rs 4,000 crore in four months to March as the government seeks to take advantage of a slump in global oil prices to shore up its revenues without stoking inflation.
Together with Rs 1.5 a litre excise duty hike effected from November 12, the government will mop up about Rs 10,000 crore in reminder of current fiscal year that will help contain budget deficit.
With Assembly elections underway in Jammu and Kashmir and Jharkhand, and polls due in Delhi soon, the state-owned fuel retailers have decided to absorb the excise duty change.
"This (excise duty hike) is not being passed on to the consumers," Indian Oil Corp chairman B Ashok told PTI.
"Since we had only yesterday revised petrol and diesel prices, we decided a change so soon is not warranted."
Oil firms had cut petrol and diesel prices by 91 paise a litre and 84 paise per litre, respectively, to factor in the slump in international oil prices. ( Read more )
Asked if oil companies while revising rates on Monday had factored in a possible excise duty hike, he said the price cut was a true reflection of fall in international oil rate - from $93.23 per barrel in first fortnight of November to $87.21 in second half, and devaluation of rupee value - from Rs 61.46 to a US dollar to Rs 61.80.
"We are absorbing the excise duty increase for now. We are keeping track of the changing scenario and will take appropriate steps as the situation warrants at the next revision (due in mid-December)," Mr Ashok added.
Excise duty on normal or unbranded petrol has been hiked from Rs 2.7 per litre to Rs 4.95 a litre and on unbranded diesel from Rs 2.96 a litre to Rs 3.96. Total incidence of excise on petrol after including special excise duty and road cess will be Rs 12.95 while that on diesel will be Rs 5.96 a litre.
Similarly, excise duty on branded petrol has been raised from Rs 3.85 a litre to Rs 6.1 and on branded diesel, from Rs 5.25 to Rs 6.25.

How the U.S. and Canadian militaries track Santas flightsBy Josh Hicks December 2 Follow @reporter_hicks

Still questioning whether Santa Claus really exists? What better proof do you need than the fact that a joint U.S.-Canadian military installation tracks the Jolly One’s global flights every Christmas?
Since 1958, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, known as NORAD, has fielded calls from anyone who wants to follow Santa’s path aboard the famous reindeer-powered sleigh. This year’s effort involves the usual telephone operators, plus a Web site , smartphone apps and various online social networks.
The tradition started in 1955 with a Sears newspaper ad that encouraged kids to call Santa — at the wrong number. Those who who dialed St. Nick at the time ended up reaching the operations center for NORAD’s predecessor, the Continental Air Defense Command.
U.S. Air Force Col. Harry Shoup, who came to be known as the “Santa Colonel,” was on duty that night and told his operators to report Father Christmas’s location to every child who called. NORAD has carried on the tradition since it’s founding three years later.
In modern times, the tracking is done by “satellite systems, high-powered radars and jet fighters,” according to NORAD . The announcements are made on the NORAD Web site and through social media. Here’s an example from Twitter in 2013:
The big guy is in Juneau, Alaska, United States
— NORAD Santa (@NoradSanta) December 25, 2013
This year, the  NORAD Tracks Santa Web site  features an elf-naming contest, a holiday countdown clock and various games. The site is available in eight languages.
Visitors to the site can watch Kris Kringle make preparations for his flight starting at 12:01 a.m. EST on Dec. 24. Trackers worldwide can inquire about his whereabouts with live telephone operators beginning at 6 a.m. EST by dialing 1-877-HI-NORAD, or via e-mail at noradtrackssanta@outlook.com.
To make the operation work, thousands of volunteers staff telephones and computers to answer calls and e-mails from children and adults. The Web site receives about 9 million unique visitors each year from more than 200 countries and territories, and the volunteers take about 12,000 e-mails and 70,000 calls, according to NORAD.

6 more bodies recovered near sunken South Korean shipPrint

Eleven more bodies have been recovered from the western Bering Sea near where a South Korean fishing ship sank earlier this week.
Kim Kang-ho from Sajo Industries, which owns the ship, said Wednesday that the bodies appear to be from the ship lost Monday in the waters near Russia. One fisherman’s body was recovered Monday and seven fishermen were rescued. More than 50 are missing.
The bodies were found by fishing vessels searching the debris of the sunken Oryong 501, said Kim.
Furious relatives have blamed the company and the ship’s captain for not doing enough to save their family members.
Officials from the ship’s company said they were hanging onto a “glimmer of hope.” But with continued rough seas and bad weather there were dwindling expectations that the fishermen would be found.

Coast guard helicopters from Russia and the United States and at least five fishing ships were searching for the missing, according to an official from Seoul’s foreign ministry, who didn’t want to be named citing office rules. He said the U.S. rescue ship Munro should arrive Thursday to help the search effort.
The crew included 35 Indonesians, 13 Filipinos, 11 South Koreans and one Russian inspector, according to the South Korean government. It’s believed the ship began to list after stormy weather caused seawater to flood its storage areas, according to officials from the government and the company that owns the ship.
The ship left South Korea on July 10 to catch pollock, a winter delicacy in South Korea, according to company officials. The sinking struck a nerve in a country less than eight months from its deadliest maritime disaster in decades. The sinking of the Sewol ferry off South Korea’s southwestern coast in April left more than 300 passengers continued…

Be very selective on pharma stocks: Pramerica MFBP Singh
In a chat with ET Now, BP Singh, Executive Director & CIO-Equities at Pramerica Mutual Fund , shares his thoughts on the pharma space. Excerpts:
ET Now: Pharma is one pocket that has no correlation with either rates or the market mood for the last 12 months. It continues to do well. What is your sense on the pharma pack at large?
BP Singh: This sector is doing well. The pharma sector is benefiting from a lot of drugs which are going out of it, and globally, they are able to capture the market share in the regulated market. But there are a few companies that are benefiting because of this.
Because this sector has done well and there is a lot of liquidity flowing in, people are excited. They start equating all companies with the same brush and they start buying everything available, including those that has not moved up.
One needs to be very selective. There are a few companies that are doing extremely well and they are underweight, but there are others that are overvalued. We are not as bullish on this sector to the point that we start to feel every company in this sector will do well. But we do believe that there are certain companies which still continue to do well because the market overseas is big and the Indian companies are cost competitive and so, some of them are naturally going to benefit.

BJP MLA Sudarshan Gupta thrashes 15 junkies for eve-teasingPeshawar school attack: Pakistani pupils recall narrow escapes, carnage in Taliban slaughter
A Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA today allegedly thrashed 15 junkies who he claimed were eve-teasing women in a park here, the incident which acquired a political hue after Congress criticised saying it highlights the law and order situation of the state.
Eye witnesses claimed that BJP MLA Sudarshan Gupta beat up 15 miscreants at the Rukmani Devi Park near Malaharganj police station when women complained that the junkies had eve-teased them and school girls.
The women too reportedly joined the MLA and thrashed the drug addicts.
“These people have disturbed the peace in Malaharganj area. I have warned them that if they were noticed at public places henceforth, I will catch them and hand them over to the police,” Gupta told reporters.
Meanwhile, Madhya Pradesh Congress spokesman Narendra Saluja said the incident showed that the law and order situation in the state had turned grim in the BJP rule and illegal businesses like sale of narcotics thrive right under the nose of police.
Saluja, however said that Gupta taking the law into his hands was incorrect. Like a law abiding public representative, Gupta should have ensured that the police took a stern action against the miscreants, Saluja said.
“Prompt action will be taken if any such incident is reported to us by public in the Malaharganj area,” Additional Superintendent of Police Aditya Pratap Singh said.

Overweight on Container Corp on haulage charge hike: BarclaysDirect equity set to top FDs as biggest asset class in FY15: Report
Indian Railways has taken a sharp increase in its haulage charges to container train operators (CTOs) effective from December 5 which Container Corporation (CCRI) has mostly passed on to end customers  The company has also passed on the 10% import congestion surcharge at ports imposed by the Indian Railways. Indian Railways increased its rates by 25-27% across various categories, which is high in our view. This is the first rate adjustment by the Indian Railways in the past 20 months.
We believe that the price increase taken by CCRI protects its margins (23% EBITDA margin in 1HFY15). However, it erodes competitive advantage vis-à-vis road transport which has further benefitted from the recent correction in diesel prices.
We highlight that 73% container traffic in India is driven on roads, thus any pricing advantage is likely to further benefit road operators.
Historically, price increases taken by CCRI have mostly remained in line with the road freight rates in India which has maintained its competitiveness, however we believe this recent tariff increase may impact this equilibrium in the near term. We retain our overweight rating on Container Corporation.

Bonds cheer hint of early-2015 rate cut...Direct equity set to top FDs as biggest asset class in FY15: Report
The benchmark 10-year government bond yield slipped below the current repo rate of 8% on Tuesday, the first time in 18 months after the Reserve Bank of India left policy rates unchanged but said it would act early 2015.
The yield on the 10-year benchmark 8.40%, 2024 bond settled at a fresh 16-month low of 7.97%%. The yield has fallen nearly 50 basis points over the last two months. The last time the 10-year bond yield had slipped below the ruling repo rate was in June 2013.
Bond traders and economists alike are penciling in deep cuts in 2015, given a rather dovish policy statement from RBI governor Raghuram Rajan on Tuesday.
“The base case for the market now is that 75-100 basis points of cut is expected over the next 15 months. The 10-year yield could see more downside, to 7.75% until March 2015,” said Ananth Narayan G, regional  head – financial markets, South Asia at Standard Chartered Bank.
In the policy statement, RBI governor Raghuram Rajan said that if the current inflation momentum and changes in inflationary expectations persist, the central bank would act even outside the normal policy review schedule. The next bi-monthly policy review is slated on February 3.
The RBI has pegged the retail inflation to be at 6% by March 2015. Inflation had eased to 5.52% in October.
Deutsche Bank expects the RBI to cut the repo rate by 50 bps. “Since the RBI believes that its actions will have a powerful signaling impact on investment sentiments, the frist cut may well be 50 bps,” said economits Taimur Baig and Kaushik Das in a note.
“It is a dovish policy with an expectation that the rate cut will happen sooner than later. The 10-year bond yield could further ease to 7.85% by December end,” said NS Venkatesh, head of treasury at IDBI Bank.

The UN General Assembly overwhelmingly approved an Arab-backed resolution on Tuesday calling on Israel to renounce possession of nuclear weapons and put its nuclear facilities under international oversight.
The resolution, adopted in a 161-5 vote, noted that Israel is the only Middle Eastern country that is not party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. It called on Israel to “accede to that treaty without further delay, not to develop, produce test or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons, to renounce possession of nuclear weapons” and put its nuclear facilities under the safeguard of the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
The United States, Canada, Palau and Micronesia joined Israel in opposing the measure, while 18 countries abstained.
The resolution, introduced by Egypt, echoed a similar Arab-backed effort that failed to gain approval in September at the IAEA. At the time, Israel criticised Arab countries for undermining dialogue by repeatedly singling out the Jewish state in international arenas.

Industry body Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) on Wednesday submitted an action plan to the government for improving country's ranking on the parameters measured by the World Bank in its ease of doing business report.
According to the industry body, it has shared three reports with the government dealing with the existing best practices to improve country's overall rankings.
The CII said that its reports recommend rationalisation of taxation regime, facilitative land acquisition process, streamlining investment approval and provisions of utilities.
"With Government's reformative drive and resolve, scalable improvement in ease of doing business through the proposed action plan will enhance investment attractiveness of the Indian economy and help attain higher GDP (gross domestic product) growth and spur job creation in a sustainable manner," said Chandrajit Banerjee, director general, CII.
CII further said that it believes that the technology aspect is one of the greatest enabler for ease of doing business as multiple processes can be merged together .
"This single factor will help improve India's position on all the parameters identified by World Bank. CII can assist the government in this endeavour so that the replacement of the current process on to IT based platform can be conducted seamlessly," Banerjee said.
In the recently released World Bank's 'Doing Business 2015' report, India is ranked low at 142 out of 189 countries in the overall ease of doing business.

Climate summit: Include more adaptation efforts in Paris deal  says IndiaPer capita annual income increases in national capital
With the ministerial-level talks to begin next week at the UN climate summit here, India today said its position remains very strong on the need for a balanced inclusion of adaptation efforts in the 2015 Paris agreement and less focus on mitigation.
Sushil Kumar, interim head of the Indian delegation at the talks, said the first two days of the 12-day conference are “off to a good start” with discussions on adaptation and finance underway.
He said that today countries participated in sessions for the adaptation and finance groups.
“Developing countries are talking quite a bit about adaptation, but not developed countries,” he said.
Ministerial-level talks will begin next week which will be attended by Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar on December 7.
“The Indian position is to remain very strong on the need for a balanced inclusion of adaptation in the 2015 Paris agreement and less focus on mitigation efforts,” said Kumar.
The conference has to agree on a draft agreement which would form the cornerstone of a historic deal to be signed in Paris in December 2015 and take effect by 2020.
Kumar said that India will “need to bring [climate change issues] into development planning” and “disseminate whatever is in the IPCC report” at the state-level within India.
The state-level action plans are important because each will be have different concerns depending on whether it is a coastal, desert, or tropical climate.
Kumar said these tailored state plans are crucial for India to put together a “comprehensive and robust” Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC).
A meeting of the Union Cabinet yesterday gave its approval to the negotiating position for the 20th Conference of Parties (COP-20) on climate change which is expected to conclude on December 12.
CoP-20 is expected to focus on the elements of 2015 Agreement and INDCs.
“The approach seeks to protect the interests of the country in climate change negotiations based on the principles of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and its Kyoto Protocol (KP). It would also enhance the solidarity among the developing countries on these issues,” a statement said.
So far 29 Indian states have submitted their action plans on adapting to and mitigating the effects of climate change with 21 state plans already approved.
Kumar noted that though the deadline “has long passed,” six states have not submitted plans due to “conceptual” problems.
The central government is assisting these states with formulating their plans by assigning organisations and institutions within each to spearhead the project of determining climate factors, agricultural issues, and their impact on local populations.
“The goal is to have every farmer…and city dweller be capable enough to interpret” signs of climate change and adjust accordingly, Kumar said, adding that this is a very distant goal for the government.
Though reports have suggested India will announce its INDC in January during a Republic Day visit from US President Barack Obama, Kumar said one should not expect the announcement not earlier than June 2015.
The structure and format of INDC’s will be discussed during the next two weeks in Lima and Kumar said the three months until the official UN deadline for INDCs of March 2015 is too soon for India to make a decision on it.
Developing countries will continue to negotiate over less mitigation-centric text but Kumar cautioned that India will “focus on the big picture” as well in terms of an overall, comprehensive agreement.
The Peru summit comes weeks after US President Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart signed a historic deal in November under which the US would reduce emissions by 28 per cent by 2025 and China would reduce emissions by 2030.
The agreement between the two biggest polluters will provide momentum, and pressure, for other countries to announce similar plans.
As the third-largest emitter, India is at the forefront of the conference because it has yet to announce a post-2020 climate action plan.

SIT set up to probe Delhi church fireBy: Press Trust of India | New Delhi |
Posted: December 3, 2014 2:15 pm
A Special Investigation Team (SIT) has been constituted to probe the incident of fire which gutted an east Delhi church, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said in the Lok Sabha today.
He said that a Joint Commissioner of Police in Delhi is heading the SIT, which has been asked to give its report within two months.
The Home Minister assured the House that the government would “act strongly against anyone trying to hurt the sentiments of people believing in any religion or faith.”
He also told Speaker Sumitra Mahajan that if she so directs, the government would have no hesitation in tabling the copy of the SIT report in the House.
“As soon as I learnt of the incident, I spoke to the Lt Governor (of Delhi) and decided to set up the SIT,” he said.
The Home Minister’s statement came a day after members in Lok Sabha condemned the suspected burning down of the church in Dilshad Garden area of east Delhi and “attempts” to give it a communal colour.
P Karunakaran (CPI-M) had alleged the church and its exhibits were completely damaged and burnt down, claiming it was “a pre-planned attempt and not an accident … The intention is to turn it into a sensitive communal issue.”
Members of various opposition parties including Congress associated themselves with Karunakaran.

Richard Rahul Verma: Obama s trip a defining & exciting time in Indo-US relationsBy: Press Trust of India | Washington |
Posted: December 3, 2014 1:08 pm
President Barack Obama’s visit to India will build on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s highly successful trip here, nominee for US Ambassador to India Richard Rahul Verma has said, describing it as a “defining and exciting” time in the re-energised Indo-US ties.
“There is no question that this is a defining and exciting time in the US-India relationship. President Obama will make a historic visit to India in January, becoming the first US head of state to attend India’s Republic Day and the only sitting US president to visit India twice,” Verma told members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday during his confirmation hearing.
Obama’s trip will build on Prime Minister Modi’s highly successful visit to the United States in September, he said.
“There’s little doubt the relationship has been re-energised, with renewed enthusiasm to take our partnership to the next level,” said Verma.
Verma, 45, if confirmed, would be the first ever Indian- American to be the top US diplomat in New Delhi.
He would replace Nancy Powell, who resigned from her position early this year.
Verma said America’s strategic partnership with India is rooted in their shared democratic values and in the joint vision of a peaceful, just and prosperous world.
“From expanding trade and defence relationships, to ensuring maritime security and freedom of navigation, from countering terrorist networks to promoting clean energy and sustainable development the US and India share a wide-range of critical national interests. Our partnership is deep, it touches nearly every endeavour of human pursuit, and it has produced important gains for each of our countries,” he said.
Referring to the growing co-operation between India and the US in various field including trade and defence, Verma said the ripple effects of our partnership need not be limited to Asia.
“As Prime Minister Modi noted, the true power and potential in this relationship is that when the oldest and largest democracies come together, the world will benefit,” he said.

UNITED NATIONS: India, along with the US and Pakistan, has voted against a provision in a UN resolution calling on to "promptly" accede to the NPT as non-nuclear- weapon nation "without conditions" and to place all its nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards.
A draft resolution on achieving a nuclear weapon-free world and accelerating the implementation of nuclear disarmament commitments was adopted in the UN General Assembly session yesterday by a recorded vote of 169 in favour to 7 against with 5 abstentions including by Bhutan and China.
Prior to the passage of the draft as a whole, a separate vote was also taken on operative paragraph 9, which stressed the fundamental role of the NPT (non-proliferation treaty) in achieving nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation and urged India, Israel and Pakistan to accede to it as non-nuclear-weapon States promptly and without conditions and to place all their nuclear facilities under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards.
The provision was retained by a recorded vote of 165 in favour with India, Israel, Pakistan, the US voting against and Bhutan, France, the UK abstaining.

WTC Hub: One of the costliest train stations...(The World Trade Center Transportation…)
By David W. Dunlap
NEW YORK: With its long steel wings poised sinuously above the National September 11 Memorial in Lower Manhattan, the World Trade Center Transportation Hub has finally assumed its full astonishing form, more than a decade after it was conceived.
Its colossal avian presence may yet guarantee the hub a place in the pantheon of civic design in New York. But it cannot escape another, more ignominious distinction as one of the most expensive and most delayed train stations ever built.
The price tag is approaching $4 billion, almost twice the estimate when plans were unveiled in 2004. Administrative costs alone - construction management, supervision, inspection, monitoring and documentation, among other items - exceed $655 million.
Even the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which is developing and building the hub, conceded it would have made other choices had it known 10 years ago what it knows now.
"We would not today prioritize spending $3.7 billion on the transit hub over other significant infrastructure needs," Patrick J. Foye, the authority's executive director, said in October.
The current, temporary trade center station serves an average of 46,000 commuters riding PATH trains to and from New Jersey every weekday, only 10,000 more than use the unassuming 33rd Street PATH terminal in Midtown Manhattan. By contrast, 208,000 Metro-North Railroad commuters stream through Grand Central Terminal daily.
In fact, the hub, or at least its winged "Oculus" pavilion, could turn out to be more of a high-priced mall than a transportation nexus, attracting more shoppers than commuters. The company operating the mall, Westfield Corp., promises in a promotional video that it will be "the most alluring retail landmark in the world."
But whatever its ultimate renown, the hub has been a money-chewing project plagued by problems far beyond an exotic and expensive design by its exacting architect, Santiago Calatrava, according to an examination based on two dozen interviews and a review of hundreds of pages of documents. The soaring price tag has also been fueled by the demands of powerful politicians whose priorities outweighed worries about the bottom line as well as the Port Authority's questionable management and oversight of private contractors.
George E. Pataki, a Republican who was then the governor of New York, was considering a run for president and knew his reputation would be burnished by a train terminal he said would claim a "rightful place among New York City's most inspiring architectural icons." He likened the transportation hub to Grand Central and promised - unrealistically - that it would be operating in 2009.
But the governor fully supported the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's desire to keep the newly rebuilt No. 1 subway line running through the trade center site, instead of allowing the Port Authority to temporarily close part of the line and shave months and hundreds of millions of dollars off the hub's construction. That, however, would have cut an important transit link and angered commuters from Staten Island, a Republican stronghold, who use the No. 1 line after getting off the ferry.
The authority was forced to build under, around and over the subway line, at a cost of at least $355 million.
Michael R. Bloomberg, who was then mayor, demanded in 2008 that the memorial be completed by the attack's 10-year anniversary. That meant part of the hub's roof, which would be the decking under the memorial plaza, had to be built first, adding about $75 million to the budget.
At the same time, the Port Authority was often its own worst enemy.
  A 2005 construction contract was supposed to set a guaranteed maximum price, but to accelerate the work, several expensive subcontracts were approved. And in 2008, the authority rejected money-saving suggestions worth over $500 million.
Ultimately, though it may prove to be the building's saving grace, the architect's extravagant vision was inextricably linked to the problems.
Calatrava - known for lyrically expressive structures that are challenging and costly to build - insisted on column-free interiors, labor-intensive building methods and sculptural and curvilinear steel elements that could only practicably be manufactured abroad.
One factory in northern Italy produced one-third of the 36,500 tons of steel in the hub. The steel bill for the entire project was $474 million.
Calatrava's boldest gesture called for a roof that could open to the sky. In 2005, not yet convinced the roof was practical to build, authority officials including David Steiner, a board member, visited the Milwaukee Art Museum to see Calatrava's operable roof there.

Minister Jyoti will not resign over hate speech  says govt; Oppn disrupts ParliamentJyoti won't resign over hate speech, govt to Oppn
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, December 03, 2014

Comments
An adamant and united opposition Wednesday continued to disrupt both Houses of Parliament demanding Union minister Niranjan Jyoti be sacked over her hate speech even though the government ruled out her resignation.
Opposition MPs refused to treat the matter as closed and forced repeated adjournments of both Houses demanding an explanation from Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
In Rajya Sabha, parliamentary affairs minister M Venkaiah Naidu rejected their demands citing controversial remarks made in the past by leaders from other parties as well.
"There is no question of resignation of minister Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti," said Naidu.
Opposition leaders asked the Prime Minister, who was present in Lok Sabha, to explain why the union minister had not been fired despite her hate speech.
Chaos in Lok Sabha
As soon as Lok Sabha took up Question Hour, leader of Congress Mallikarjun Kharge said in apparent sarcasm that it is a privilege that the Prime Minister is present in the House.
He said since the Prime Minister was himself present in the House, he was insisting on the resignation of Jyoti from the council of ministers for her controversial remarks.
Reacting to Kharge's taunt, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) members retorted saying Modi has been attending parliamentary proceedings.
Soon, Congress members, joined by Trinamool Congress and MPs from other opposition parties, trooped into the Well demanding a reply from the PM. They also demanded her resignation and lodging of an FIR against the Union minister.
Speaker Sumitra Mahajan said if records are checked then most of the members would be found having made controversial remarks in their public life.
BJP's women MPs too criticised the opposition for repeatedly disrupting Parliament over the incident saying they were doing so as they had run out of issues.
"Congress and TMC created a scene. To oppose it we also stood on our feet. The sad thing is when the NDA government's minister has apologised, then raising the same issue again for the second day, we condemn it," BJP MP Poonam Mahajan said.
Mahajan, who was accompanied by a group of women MPs of her party, said that members wanted to raise issues related to development of their constituencies but the opposition was not allowing proceedings in the Question Hour or Zero Hour by disrupting Parliament.
She claimed the opposition parties like Congress and TMC just wanted to create a scene before the Prime Minister.
"They don't have issues and they don't have a leader. That is why they have done it," Mahajan said.
Normality was restored in the Lok Sabha in the afternoon after members of the Congress, Trinamool and Left staged a walkout. The House managed to pass the School of Planning and Architecture Bill and took up the Repealing and Amending (Second) Bill, 2014.
Similar scenes in Rajya Sabha
BJP members engaged in angry exchange of words with those in the Opposition as the government appeared toughening its stand on the issue with a number of ministers countering the demand.
Members from Congress, SP and JD (U) trooped into the Well while those from CPI-M, CPI and Trinamool Congress were on their feet rejecting the government's argument that the matter should be treated as closed since the minister has already expressed regret.
The House was adjourned four times in the pre-lunch session because of the pandemonium.
Soon after Rajya Sabha Chairman Hamid Ansari took up obituary references after the House met for the day, Opposition members were on their feet demanding action against the minister.
Renewing his demand for passing a condemnation resolution by the House, Naresh Agrawal (SP) said, "This House does not have faith in the minister and demands that she be sacked."
Deputy leader of Congress Anand Sharma said the remarks made by the minister is "not only a cognisable but also compoundable offence" under section 153(A) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and demanded that the Prime Minister should come to the House and inform it that the minister has been sacked.
Section 153(A) of the IPC deals with the offence of promoting enmity between different groups on ground of religion, race, place of birth, residence and language and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony.
"We are not seeking any apology. The minister should be sacked. This is an insult to the Constitution. The Prime Minister should inform the House that the minister has been sacked," Sharma said.
Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Sitaram Yechury resented that Opposition members were not given a chance to seek clarifications on the minister's statement "against the norms of the House".
Sharad Yadav of Janata Dal (United) said if the Prime Minister, who has appointed Jyoti a minister takes action against her, it will send a signal and others will not make such remarks in future.
As Sharma kept insisting that what the minister said constituted of a criminal offence that could fetch an imprisonment of up to three years, members from the treasury benches told him to "go to the court".
When Kurien called a member from the ruling BJP to speak on the issue, Opposition members resented it and trooped into the Well.
There were two adjournments in the Zero Hour.
Similar scenes were witnessed during the Question Hour also.
As Chairman Hamid Ansari took up the first question of the day, Congress members came into the Well shouting slogans. SP and JD-U members also joined them.
Ansari's request to allow the Question Hour to proceed went in vain and amid din, he adjourned the House for 15 minutes.
When the House reassembled, Opposition members resumed their protest and the House was adjourned till 2pm.
But the Rajya Sabha witnessed a washout as it was adjourned for the day. Later in the evening, a Delhi high court lawyer filed a complaint against the minister at Tilak Nagar police station for her hate speech. Additional DCP (West) Monika Bharadwaj said no case was registered.
Jyoti, minister of state for food processing industries, had apologised in Parliament on Tuesday, reportedly on the orders of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but opposition parties like the Left want her sacked and say she must face criminal charges for trying to incite communal hatred.
Addressing a meeting of the BJP parliamentary board, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also asked party MPs to be cautious when making comments in public.
The government, had earlier said that the matter was closed with the minister expressing regret. But, Congress members indicated that they intended to press the issue in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday.
Niranjan Jyoti had reportedly had said at a public meeting in Delhi on Monday, "The people of Delhi have to decide if they want a government of Ramzaadon (descendants of Ram) or haramzaadon (those who are illegitimately born)."

Sailing to Agra on Yamuna to be reality soon: NitinGadkariBy: Press Trust of India | New Delhi |
Posted: December 3, 2014 3:08 pm | Updated: December 3, 2014 3:58 pm
People will soon be able to go to Agra sailing on the Yamuna as the Centre has sought help from the Netherlands government for the ambitious project that includes building barrages and water terminals on both sides of the river.
“Soon people can go to Agra via Delhi through Yamuna…We will float a Cabinet note within 10 days to specify works for the project by our Ministry and the Delhi Government,” Road Transport, Highways and Shipping Minister Nitin Gadkari said.
“We will request Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to ensure special funds for the project,” he said.
After chairing a high-level meet to discuss the project, Gadkari said the Netherlands government has agreed to come out with a technical report for the project which includes specifications regarding construction of barrages and two water-terminals at both ends of Yamuna.
“Netherlands has expertise in this in the world. I had a talk with the Netherlands Ambassador. We have asked a Netherlands government agency to prepare the project management report including technical consultancy, for which they have agreed,” he said.
Gadkari said barrages would be constructed to ensure at least five metres water in Yamuna round-the-year to ensure passengers and goods transportation through the waterways.
He added that more barrages would be constructed ahead of Wazirabad so that Delhi does not face the water crisis and if need be talks will be held with the Haryana government.
“We have already given nod to seaplanes. We are allowing hovercrafts. We are constructing water-terminals at both the ends of Yamuna on the pattern of airports,” he said.
Unveiling the plans, Gadkari said Delhi Development Authority will beautify the riverbanks while the Delhi Jal Board will prevent effluents from being released in Yamuna.
Officials of the Ministry of Shipping in consultation with Delhi Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung will integrate the scheme, he said.
Gadkari said his ministry has accorded highest priority to development of waterways in the country which has been “sadly” ignored so far with the country’s goods and passenger transport through the mode barely at 0.5 percent of the total transport in comparison to China where the percentage was 20
per cent.
The stress is being given on waterways from Varanasi to Kolkata and from Delhi to Agra now in addition to the existing five waterways in the country, he said.

BRUSSELS: US and EU leaders on Wednesday will pledge to work together on sanctions and on strengthening Europe and Ukraine's energy security as they seek to present a united front to Russia, according to a draft document seen by Reuters.
Throughout the year, the United States has led the push for tougher sanctions, while many governments in Europe, afraid economic measures on Russia will hurt them as much as they hurt Moscow, have been more cautious.
US Secretary of State John Kerry and US Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz are in Brussels for talks with EU leaders.
"The Council (EU-US talks) concurred on the need to coordinate the application of our respective sanctions regimes, while reinforcing measures against separatists as well as in relation to the non-recognition policy related to the illegal annexation of Crimea," a draft statement seen by Reuters said.
The statement said the crisis between Russia and Ukraine that flared up with Moscow's annexation of Crimea in March can be de-escalated as was shown by a tentative October agreement brokered by the EU on gas pricing to try to prevent a supply crisis over the peak winter months.
Moscow cut off Kiev's gas in June in a row over unpaid bills and the price Gazprom charges Ukraine and any truce is very uncertain.
For the future, the draft welcomed "the prospect of US liquefied natural gas exports" to Europe to diversify supplies.
It also said the European Union and the United States stood "shoulder-to-shoulder in their support for Ukraine's new government and underlined the necessity of continuing the reforms in Ukraine's energy sector".

Adhiban beats Kuzubov; Kramnik beats Giri
PTI
chess
Grandmaster B Adhiban scored his fifth victory on the trot, beating Ukraine’s Yuriy Kuzubov, to grab the joint fifth spot after the seventh round of the Qatar Masters International Open Chess tournament in Doha.
Starting with losses in the first rounds of the tournament, Adhiban emerged as the best performing Indian in the tournament after a fine attacking victory against Kuzubov with black pieces. For the records it was a King’s Indian defence wherein the Indian checkmated his higher ranked opponent.
Vladimir Kramnik proved his true mettle when it mattered the most and scored a crushing victory against overnight leader Anish Giri. The Semi Slav by Giri met with the Fianchetto system and Kramnik was at his technical best in a must-win situation.
This result threw the tournament open again as Kramnik and Giri emerged as joint leaders on six points apiece and these two are now followed by A R Salem Saleh and Yu Yangyi of China who both have 5.5 points in their kitty.
With just two rounds to come, Adhiban shares the fifth spot along with 13 others.
In other important games involving Indians, P. Harikrishna was held to a draw by Daniil Dubov of Russia while Grandmaster Abhijeet Gupta played out another draw with a top-50 member, holding Ding Liren of China in a wild game of the seventh round.
Adhiban, however, stole the show with a crushing win against Kuzubov. The King’s Indian by the Indian met with the Classical system and Kuzubov sacrificed a pawn on the king side early.
Adhiban was in control throughout as he capitalised on his extra material to put pressure in the center. As the game progressed, Kuzubov lost a rook for a Bishop and the outcome of the game was never in doubt thereafter.
Meeting his third 2700+ opponent in a row and the highest rated Chinese, Gupta again stood out to be a better prepared than his opponent and got the half point after wild complexities ensued out of a Grunfeld.
Playing black again, Gupta faced one of the topical variations and Liren had to spend quite some time to come up with a plan in the opening.
Even as he missed a small chance to seize initiative early, Gupta fell slightly worse but quickly recovered to launch a fierce counter attack. Liren, decided against taking any great risk and the draw was agreed to on move 34.
Harikrishna and Gupta are now under some pressure to win the next round to stay in contention for a top ten finish in this strongest open tournament of the world.
Important and Indian results round 7 (Indians unless specified): Vladimir Kramnik (Rus, 6) beat Anish Giri (Ned, 6); Mikhailo Oleksienko (Ukr, 5) drew with Evgeny Tomashevsky (Rus, 5); Yuriy Kryvoruchko (Ukr, 5) drew with Samuel Shankland (Usa, 5); Yu Yangyi (Chn, 5.5) beat Aleksandr Lenderman (Usa, 4.5); Rauf Mamedov (Aze, 4.5) lost to A R Saleh Salem (Uae, 5.5); Andrey Vovk (Ukr, 4) lost to Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (Fra, 5); Ding Liren (Chn, 4.5) drew with Abhijeet Gupta (4.5); Daniil Dubov (Rus, 4.5) drew with P Harikrishna (4.5); Yuriy Kuzubov (Ukr, 4) lost to B Adhiban (5); Ivan Salgado Lopez (Esp, 4.5) beat Debashis Das (3.5); Robin Van Kampen (Ned, 4.5) beat Aravindh Chithambaram (3.5); Elina Danielian (Arm, 4) drew with G N Gopal (4); D Harika (3) lost to Hrant Melkumyan (Arm, 4); Murali Karthikeyan (3.5) drew with Mikheil Mchedlishvili (Geo, 3.5); M Shyam Sundar (3) lost to Anton Guijarro David (Esp, 4); Sandipan Chanda (3) lost to Bela Khotenashvili (Geo, 4); M S Thejkumar (3.5) drew with Eric Hansen (Can, 3.5); Shardul Gagare (3.5) drew with Gao Rui (Chn, 3.5); Xu Jun (Chn, 3.5) drew with Sayantan Das (3.5); Fabien Libiszewski (Fra, 4) beat S Vijayalakshmi (3);Gabriel Sargissian (Arm, 3.5) beat Rishi Sardana (2.5); S Kidambi(3.5) beat Viktor Bologan (Mda, 2.5); Neelotpal Das(3) drew with Surya Shekhar Ganguly (3); Alexander Ipatov (Tur, 3.5) beat Sameer Kathmale (2.5): Inna Gaponenko (Ukr, 3.5) beat Ankit Rajpara (2.5); Aryan Tari (Nor, 3) drew with P Konguvel (3); Mary Ann Gomes (2) drew with Aleksandra Dimitrijevic (Bih, 2).

Modi govt contradicts Amit Shah  says no Saradha-Burdwan linkGovt contradicts Amit Shah on Burdwan blast
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, December 03, 2014

The government Wednesday contradicted Bharatiya Janata Party chief Amit Shah's allegation that money from Saradha chit fund was used in the October 2 blast in West Bengal's Burdwan saying the probe has so far not revealed any connection.
Jitendra Singh, minister of state in the prime minister's office, in a written reply in Rajya Sabha said there was "no link". The minister also clarified there was no evidence yet that money from the scam was sent to Bangladesh.
"The investigation has so far not revealed any such transaction where money was routed to Bangladesh to fund terrorist activities," Singh told the House.
 
Shah, while speaking in Kolkata on Sunday, had alleged that Mamata Banerjee's government and her party, Trinamool Congress, were
shielding the accused in the Saradha scam.
"Saradha chit fund money was used in the Burdwan blast. The NIA is not being allowed to probe the blast properly. Hurdles are being
created. It is being done in order to save TMC leaders who are involved in the blast," Shah had alleged, attacking the Trinamool Congress.
 
The minister was asked whether the government has sought details of the probe into the Saradha chit fund scam after reports indicated that a part of the money was routed to Bangladesh to fund terror activities. Singh replied that government has not sought details of the
probe.
 
To another question on whether the Saradha chief has admitted that he paid large sums to several people to influence the case in his
favour, Singh said "the matter is under investigation."
As the Opposition, especially the Trinamool attacked Shah, Union minister Babul Supriyo, elected on BJP ticket from West Bengal, expressed surprise over Singh's statement and alleged that the ruling party in Bengal and its MPs had links with terror plot in Bangladesh.
"I came to know about Jitendra Singh's statement a little while back. There is a different reason. There were a lot of responsible minds who acted very fast to ensure that the state government has evidence, proofs and it has been recorded in front of several TV cameras," Supriyo told reporters outside Parliament.
"The state government was instrumental in destroying evidence that could prove state government's, TMC's or their MPs' connection with the terror plot that is not only West Bengal centric but also finds its way into Bangladesh and neighbouring countries," he said.
"So it was very smart of the central government to get NIA into the act. NIA is right now doing a very comprehensive research into the entire act. I got to know what Jitendra Singh said a while ago. I need to find out why he said so."
On October 2, a blast in a house in the Khagragarh area of Burdwan in West Bengal killed two people and critically injured a third person.
Investigators suspect people who were living in the house belong to a Bangladeshi militant organisation known as the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh.

See you out in the middle: Clarke s tearful words to Phillip HughesClarke's bids tearful farewell to Phillip Hughes

Australia captain Michael Clarke urged mourners to "dig in and get through to tea" as he choked back tears in an emotional eulogy for Phillip Hughes at the cricketer's funeral on Wednesday.
A near-constant presence at Hughes's bedside during his two-day fight for life, Clarke sucked back deep breaths at Macksville High School hall during the tribute to his "little brother's" spirit.
"Oh, he would definitely be calling me a sook (crybaby) right now, that's for sure," Clarke began, gasping for air in the stifling hot room packed with 1,000 people.
"I don't know about you, but I keep looking for him. I know it is crazy but I expect any minute to take a call from him or to see his face pop around the corner.
"Is this what we call the spirit? If so, then his spirit is still with me. And I hope it never leaves."
Hughes died last Thursday at the age of 25, two days after being rushed to hospital for emergency surgery, having been struck by a rising delivery during a domestic match at the Sydney Cricket Ground.
Clarke joined fellow cricketers and Hughes's father and brother among the pallbearers in delivering the coffin to the hearse before it set off in procession through the cricketer's hometown of Macksville, New South Wales.
The 33-year-old skipper spoke of his visit to the SCG wicket on the night of Hughes's death.
"I knelt down and touched the grass, I swear he was with me," said Clarke, who had helped usher Hughes into Australia's state ranks then the national team.
"Picking me up off my feet to check if I was okay. Telling me we just needed to dig in and get through to tea.
"Telling me off for that loose shot I played. Chatting about what movie we might watch that night. And then passing on a useless fact about cows.
"And I could see him swagger back to the other end, grin at the bowler, and call me through for a run with such a booming voice, a bloke in the car park would hear it.
"Is this what indigenous Australians believe about a person's spirit being connected with the land upon which they walk? If so, I know they are right about the SCG. His spirit has touched it and it will forever be a sacred ground for me."
Clarke said Hughes's death would strengthen the bonds of cricket around the world.
"Phillip's spirit, which is now part of our game forever, will act as a custodian of the sport we all love. We must listen to it. We must cherish it. We must learn from it," he added.
"We must dig in," Clarke faltered, crying.
"We must dig in and get through to tea. And we must play on.
"So rest in peace, my little brother. I will see you out in the middle."

I suffered a lot while doing Badlapur : VarunDhawanBy: Indo-Asian News Service | Mumbai |
Posted: December 3, 2014 3:50 pm
Essaying a rugged looking and aggresive character in ‘Badlapur’ didn’t come easy to Varun Dhawan, who has earlier featured in comical and romantic roles.
His demeanour in the first look of ‘Badlapur’ is being appreciated by one and all, but Varun admits it was not easy for him to get into the skin of the character.
“I suffered a lot while doing this film. I can’t say that I enjoyed doing the film,” Varun, who has a dark character in the film, said at its teaser launch here Tuesday.
However, looking at the teaser is a comforting experience for the 27-year-old actor, who has in the past featured in films like ‘Student Of The Year’, ‘Main Tera Hero’ and ‘Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania’.
“Whenever I see the film’s teaser and I realise that I got to work with wonderful actor like Nawazuddin Siddiqui, I get emotional. It’s a very emotional experience for me,” added Varun, who is sharing the screen for the first time with Nawazuddin and Huma in the film.
‘Badlapur’ is a revenge drama and also features Divya Dutta, Yami Gautam, Radhika Apte and Vinay Pathak. It will release early next year.

Israeli lawmakers to vote on dissolvingparliamentBy: Associated Press | Jerusalem |
Posted: December 3, 2014 3:47 pm
Israeli lawmakers are set to vote on a motion that will pave the way for early elections.
December 3 vote in the Knesset is a preliminary one and is likely to pass. Further votes expected next week will officially dissolve Israel’s parliament, ushering in new polls two years ahead of schedule.
The current government took office in early 2013 and has been riven by divisions from the beginning over the major issues facing the country.
On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired two rebellious Cabinet ministers and said elections would be held “as soon as possible.”
The election, expected to be held early next year, would come at a time of growing violence between Palestinians and Jews and deepening despair over the prospects for peace.

Five controversial comments that Modi govt found difficult todefendBy: Express News Service | New Delhi |
Posted: December 3, 2014 3:29 pm | Updated: December 4, 2014 9:05 am
Union minister Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti’s controversial remark has once again put the Narendra Modi government on a sticky wicket. A united Opposition now wants Modi to sack the minister. This not the first instance when the Modi govt has been embarrassed with rather outlandish and extremely sectarian comments made by the BJP leaders.
Here are the five controversial remarks that has embarrassed Modi.
Babulal Gaur: While Narendra Modi was strong in speaking about women safety from the gallery of Red Fort in his Independence Day speech, Madhya Pradesh home minister Babulal Gaur was seen stirring controversy by describing rape as a social crime which is “sometimes right, sometimes wrong”. He also insisted that governments could not ensure that women do not get raped, triggering angry reactions from the Congress.
Giriraj Singh: On of the prominent faces in Bihar BJP, Giriraj Singh drew flak by calling Modi’s critics Pakistanis. He said, “Those who want to stop BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi will soon have no place in India… because their place will be in Pakistan”.
Mohan Bhagwat: While Modi feels Indian Muslims will live and die for India, BJP’s parent organisation RSS’ chief Mohan Bhagwat has different take on the issue. Bhagwat feels India is a Hindu nation and Hindutva is its identity. “Hindustan is a Hindu nation…Hindutva is the identity of our nation and it (Hinduism) can incorporate others (religions) in itself,” he said.
Yogi Adityanath: This man and his inflammatory speeches were held responsible for BJP’s dismal performance in recent by-elections in UP. Yogi Adityanath, who was the star campaigner of the saffron party, was quite vocal about his religious views during the campaign. He stroked a controversy when he said that communal riots happen in the places where a particular minority community constitute 20-40 percent of the total population. The Election Commission also served notice to Adityanath for hate speech.
Niranjan Jyoti: Addressing voters in west Delhi’s Shyam Nagar, the Union Minister told voters, “Aapko tay karna hai ki Dilli mein sarkar Ramzadon ki banegi ya har**zadon ki. Yeh aapka faisla hai (you have to decide whether Delhi will get a government of those born of Ram or of those born illegitimately).” The reaction from the opposition to this remark was so strong that PM Modi issued a diktat to the party leaders for not speaking out of turn.

Will Smith  Tom Hardy join SuicideSquadBy: Press Trust of India | Los Angeles |
Posted: December 3, 2014 3:29 pm
Hollywood stars Will Smith and Tom Hardy have joined the cast of ‘Suicide Squad’. The much-awaited super-villain movie will also star Jared Leto, Margot Robbie, Jai Courtney and Cara Delevingne, following much speculation, reported Variety.
Jesse Eisenberg may also show up in the film as Lex Luthor, after he takes on the role in ‘Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice’. “The Warner Bros roots are deep on this one,” Warner Bros president Greg Silverman said in a statement. “We look forward to seeing this terrific ensemble, under David Ayer’s amazing guidance, give new meaning to what it means to be a villain and what it means to be a hero.”
Based on the DC Comic, ‘Suicide Squad’ was confirmed when Warner Bros announced its DC film slate up to 2020 in October. The story follows supervillains who were organised by the US government to work together as a black ops team in exchange for redemption. ‘Suicide Squad’ will be directed by David Ayer (Training Day, Fury) and produced by Charles Roven and Richard Suckle. It begins shooting in Toronto next April. ‘Suicide Squad’ releases on August 5, 2016 in the US.

Kenya security chiefs ousted after fresh ShabaabkillingsBy: Press Trust of India | Nairobi (kenya) |
Posted: December 3, 2014 3:19 pm | Updated: December 3, 2014 3:26 pm
Kenya’s interior minister and police chief have been removed from their posts, hours after Somalia’s Shebaab rebels carried out a fresh massacre in the northeast of the country.
In a televised address to the nation yesterday, President Uhuru Kenyatta also vowed his security forces will “intensify the war on terrorism” after a spate of killings in the country by the Al-Qaeda-affiliated insurgents.
A group of Shebab rebels stormed into a quarry near the border town of Mandera shortly after midnight, and police and officials said they weeded out 36 non-Muslims for execution.
Those labourers not shot as they slept were placed in lines in the dusty quarry, with insurgents shooting most in the head but also beheading others.
Their bodies were flown to Nairobi later on Monday on a military transport plane.
The Shebab said in a statement their latest cross-border attack was fresh retaliation for Kenya’s 2011 invasion and continued presence in Somalia, as well as its treatment of Muslims in the troubled port city of Mombasa.
The assault came just over a week after the Shabaab executed 28 people grabbed from a bus travelling from Mandera, on the frontier between Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia.
Kenyatta, however, said Kenyan troops would stay put in Somalia, where they are now part of an African Union force battling the Shebab and supporting the war-torn country’s internationally-backed government.
“This is a war and a war that we must win, we must win it together,” he said. “The ultimate aim of this atrocious campaign is to create an extremist caliphate.”
He called the Shabaab “deranged animals” who had killed more than 800 people in attacks inside Kenya, including 500 civilians and 300 security officers.
“We will not flinch or relent in the war against terrorism in our country and our region. We shall continue to inflict painful casualties on these terrorists until we secure our country and region.”
The Kenyan government has been under fire since last year’s Shebab attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi, in which at least 67 people were killed in a siege involving just four gunmen and which lasted four days.
Sending condolences to the families of the latest victims, the United States said there was “no excuse or justification for this kind of terrorist violence.”
Washington had been “very clear about the threat posed” by Shebab, said State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf, adding US officials “vigorously condemn” the group’s “continued cowardly, brutal targeting of civilians.”
Worries over internal security mounted when Shebab rebels massacred 100 people in a string of raids against villages in the Lamu region on the Kenyan coast in June and July.

Suicide bomber rams car into UN convoy in Mogadishu  3deadBy: Associated Press | Mogadishu |
Posted: December 3, 2014 3:17 pm | Updated: December 3, 2014 3:39 pm
A Somali police officer says a suicide bomber rammed his vehicle into a U.N. convoy near Mogadishu’s airport, killing three people.
Ahmed Ali said the Wednesday morning attack also wounded seven people. Ali did not immediately say if those killed and wounded were a part of the U.N. convoy or were passers-by.
Yusuf Haji, a resident in the area, said that soldiers fired at pedestrians after the blast.
The militant group al-Shabab frequently carries out suicide blasts and gunfire attacks in Mogadishu. The group has also claimed responsibility for two gruesome and deadly attacks against Kenyan civilians near the Kenya-Somali border over the last two weeks.
 

India eases FDI rules for construction sectorCentre formalises easier FDI rules for construction

(Under the new rules, foreign…)
NEW DELHI: India has liberalised foreign direct investment rules in the construction sector, formalising a decision taken by the Cabinet in October to attract foreign capital and give a fillip to the cash-starved industry.
According to a Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion Press Note, which makes the new rules formal, the conditions related to built-up area and minimum capitalisation have been relaxed for projects where overseas investors can put in money. The new rules also make it easier for foreign investors to exit projects.
A foreign investor will now be allowed to exit after either the project's completion or the development of trunk infrastructure such as roads, water supply, street lighting, drainage and sewerage. If an investor wants to leave the project earlier, he can transfer the stake to another foreign investor after getting approval from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, which vets overseas investments.
The Union Cabinet had allowed to reduce the minimum floor area of projects to 20,000 sq metres from the earlier 50,000 sq metres for getting FDI.
It had also halved the minimum capital requirement of projects where FDI is allowed to $5 million.
In the case of joint venture projects with an Indian partner, it had cut the minimum capital requirement is $2.5 million from $5 million previously. However, experts say the government must clarify if the new changes will apply to existing projects where investment has already come in.
"What the Press Note does not answer is treatment of existing investments in construction development sector which were made under the erstwhile policy," said Akash Gupt, partner, regulatory services, at PricewaterhouseCoopers. "If the investment has been made with a commercial understanding with the Indian partner to exit post three years, will that now be locked-in till completion of the project?"
Most housing projects have been running one to two years or even more behind schedule because of an economic slowdown and shortage of funds on account of elevated debt levels.
The new rules also drop the condition of minimum land of 10 hectares.
"This will aid the market in attracting more investments, especially helping in addressing housing shortage within the country. The easier exit on the other hand will ensure faster delivery of projects, reducing cost and time overruns by development firms," said Sachin Sandhir, global managing director for emerging business and MD South Asia at Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
In what could drive affordable housing in the country, developers will be exempt from restrictions in size, minimum capitalisation and exit if they commit 30% of project cost to affordable housing.
Looking to boost construction of hotels , tourist resorts, hospitals, special economic zones, educational institutions, old-age homes and investments by non-resident Indians, the government has given free access to investors in these segments.The new rules will also give a boost to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of creating 100 smart cities by 2020 that will provide modern amenities, education and employment opportunities.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had allocated Rs 7,060 crore in the Budget for 2014-15 for this purpose.
The construction sector attracted $1.2 billion in FDI in 2013-14, down 8% from 2012-13. Between April and August this fiscal year, the sector received investments worth $446 million.Based on the new rules, at least 50% of each project must be developed within a period of five years from the date of obtaining all mandatory clearances. Investors wouldn't be allowed to sell underdeveloped plots.

Eurozone economy set to contract in new year...Eurozone
(Region is on course to see…)
LONDON: Heavy discounting failed to stop euro zone business activity growing less than thought last month, a survey showed on Wednesday, suggesting the bloc's economy may contract again early next year.
"The region is on course to see a mere 0.1 per cent GDP growth in the final quarter of the year, with a strong likelihood of the near-stagnation turning to renewed contraction in the new year unless demand shows signs of reviving," said Chris Williamson, survey compiler Markit's chief economist.
A Reuters poll last month predicted 0.2 per cent economic growth this quarter and 0.3 per cent next.
Markit's final November Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), based on surveys of thousands of companies across the region and seen as a good indicator of growth, sank to 51.1 from October's 52.1, missing an earlier flash reading of 51.4.
November was the 17th month the index has been above the 50 level that separates growth from contraction. But the new business sub-index fell below that mark for the first time since the middle of last year, dropping to 49.7 from 50.8 and suggesting a further downturn in December.
A PMI covering the region's dominant service industry fell to 51.1 from October's 52.3, shy of the flash 51.3, and showed firms have been cutting prices for three full years now to drum up business. The output price index came in at 47.1.
Further price cutting, together with signs of economic performance deteriorating in the core countries, will concern the European Central Bank which is battling to reinvigorate the economy and drive up dangerously low inflation.
Annual inflation dipped to 0.3 per cent in November, deep into the ECB's "danger zone" for price moves, although the central bank is not expected to alter its already very loose policy when it meets on Thursday.
The central bank is offering banks long-term cheap loans and buying covered bonds and asset-backed securities. However, facing resistance from Germany, there is only an even chance it will buy government bonds, a Reuters poll found last week.
"Survey results indicate that policy initiatives currently announced have yet to have a meaningful impact on business or consumer confidence in the region, and that more aggressive measures are likely to be needed, and quickly implemented, if another recession is to be averted," Williamson said.

SAIL share sale likely on December 5; stock cracks over 5%

The disinvestment of 5 per cent stake in state-run Steel Authority of India is likely to happen on December 5 (Friday), says ET Now quoting sources.
This would be the government's first disinvestment in the current financial year (FY15).
The stock took a tumble on the Street after the news came in. It slipped as much as 5.09 per cent.
At 3:09 pm, the stock was trading at Rs 85.50; down 4.84 per cent.
The sale of 5 per cent stake, or about 20.65 crore shares , of the steel maker at the current market price of Rs 85.45 apiece would fetch the exchequer around Rs 1,764.54 crore.
Domestic roadshows for the issue were held in Mumbai and Chennai in September. Two teams were sent to meet overseas investors. While one visited London, New York and Boston, the other solicited participation of investors based in Singapore and Hong Kong.
Apart from SAIL , Coal India , NHPC , PFC and REC are on the block among others. The government has been using the OFS route for disinvestment of PSUs.
The Cabinet had in July 2012 approved a 10.82 per cent stake sale in the country's largest steel maker. Accordingly, the first tranche of disinvestment of 5.82 per cent was done in March 2013.
Retail investors would be offered an additional incentive of an increased investment quota as well as discount to the issue price, which would be announced a day before the OFS. The government might announce the issue date two days prior to the OFS.
Market regulator Sebi had in January, 2013 permitted the promoters of top 100 companies to use the auction route or OFS route to dilute stake in listed companies. It also permitted OFS in those PSUs which were to meet the minimum 25 per cent public holding norm.

Crisil downgrades Pratibha Inds; stock surges 10%Clean Ganga project
(We are waiting for this opportunity.…)
In an interview with ET Now, Ravi Kulkarni, WholeTime Director, Pratibha Group of Companies, shares his business outlook and talks about the opportunities that lie ahead for the Group. Excerpts:
ET Now: The potential size of the Clean Ganga Project alone is huge. How big is the opportunity for a company such as Pratibha?
Ravi Kulkarni: Our company works a lot in this sector. The Clean Ganga Project is a big opportunity for us and we are already doing a project with DJB, which is a sewerage network. This makes us qualified for this the whole Ganga concept. It is important for a company like us to participate in such projects because the entire budget of this project is huge. It is a tremendous opportunity not only for Pratibha, but a lot of other companies working in this space.
ET Now: What are the rime lines here and what is the size of the opportunity for a company like yours? You mentioned you are into the sewage aspect as well. That would probably be the first of the legs to kicks off?
Ravi Kulkarni: If you talk only about Ganga, then there is an opportunity of around Rs 30,000-40,000 crore, but the overall sector has tremendous opportunities as we are yet to reach out to the rural India.
There is a lot of opportunity in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Bihar. So you cannot talk only about Ganga. Ganga is only given importance because of the significance it holds. Overall when you see the sector, it has a lot of potential which can take care of a lot of companies.
We at Pratibha are eyeing a big pie because the sector is very close to us. This is our core sector, this is where our revenue comes from. So we are waiting for this opportunity. Of the Rs 30,000-40,000-crore chunk, we are at least eyeing Rs 2000-3000 crore from it.
ET Now: Where Pratibha Industries is currently because there has just been a CRISIL downgrade coming in? They have downgraded your stock ratings to negative right now. How would you defend that?
Ravi Kulkarni: There is a lot of stress in the market and it is not only Pratibha, but a lot of other companies which are going through that stress.
We are aware of what is happening in the market. That is why we are very aggressive on securing projects. We have recently secured an overseas contract which will take a little bit of that stress.
We are committed to our shareholders and we will deliver them. About stress, we will come out of this in another two to three months. We have tightened up our shoes for execution and are bidding aggressively. We are securing contracts at a decent rate and at a decent margin which is very important today.
Of course, ratings at times will go down and sometimes they will come up. As of now, we have been a company which is consistent in performance. It is because of the recent laws which have changed that we are under stress. In fact, the best of the companies are under stress. So we are not out from that group, we are in the same group, but definitely we will pick up. That is what we also believe in.
 
ET Now: A Crisil note which has just come out today says that you have completed the sale of the Saw Pipe division and are looking to sell other non-core assets as well as raising equity through qualified institutional placement. Can you give us some updates there because that will probably give a bit of view to your shareholders?
Ravi Kulkarni: When the topic rises about selling our assets which are of no use for us, we are definitely selling them. We have already sold our pipe mill, which has given us a little ease. We have some other assets which need to be sold and we are doing it.
Markets were not good earlier, but now things are picking up. Things are a little slow because it is the construction business. It is not magic.
ET Now: It is a difficult business we understand. So tell us about the order book. You mentioned about the immense opportunity from...
Ravi Kulkarni: Our strategy is very clear now and we will stick to our core business, which is water and waste water. It is a priority for the country also and, that is what we are doing.
We recently bagged an order from Sri Lanka, which is a Rs 1,100-crore water pipeline. So, we trying our level best to take up jobs which are at decent rate and can put us back to the track. It is just that we have lost a little bit of the way which we will come back on. We see things moving very fast for us now.
ET Now: Just before we wrap up, what happens over the next 12 months? Does your revenue look better than what it right now?
Ravi Kulkarni: I am 101% sure it will be better because we have tightened up execution in a very aggressive manner. Our MD is bent upon that execution has to be done in a most appropriate and professional manner, which we are doing. There were certain delays on our side, which we accept. It is not a hidden story. We are a construction company and everything is visible. We will come back to our original position and we will try to give better revenue to our people.

Most of GW Parkway reopens after sinkhole disrupts traffic(Related:  Commuters react to sinkhole that caused major delays on GW Parkway )
Updated at 9:16 a.m.
After 12 hours of crews working to fix a pothole that shut down the southbound lanes of the George Washington Memorial Parkway, federal highway officials said they ‘ll now try to figure out what caused the problem.
The roadway’s southbound lanes between Route 123 and Spout Run Parkway were closed all day Tuesday after a sinkhole was discovered Monday night. Crews arrived on the scene around 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday and finished fixing the roadway around 8:30 p.m. the same day. But a small portion of the roadway was still closed in the early morning hours Wednesday because the asphalt was drying in the wet, damp conditions, according to officials at the Federal Highway Administration.
The entire stretch reopened shortly after 6 a.m. Wednesday. On Tuesday, the closure of the roadway caused traffic delays throughout the morning rush hour.
Federal highway officials said Wednesday that they are not immediately sure what caused the sinkhole but are looking into it.
“They were focused on fixing the problem rather than studying it,” said Doug Hecox, a spokesman for the Federal Highway Administration, which was in charge of helping fix the pothole. He said there could be a variety of reasons for sinkholes, including water accumulating underneath the roadway or “changing geological conditions way, way underground.”
“They’re not easily predictable,” he said. He said the 12-hour fix was “especially fast when you consider all the weird weather.” Typically, it is a bit faster and easier to fix roadway problems with asphalt when it is warm and dry.
Updated at 6:06 a.m.
All of the southbound lanes on the George Washington Memorial Parkway are now open after a sinkhole shut it down Tuesday.
Updated at 4:30 a.m. Wednesday
Some of the southbound lanes of the George Washington Memorial Parkway reopened early Wednesday morning, but some work remains on part of the roadway as crews continue to fix an area where a sinkhole erupted.
A sinkhole had led to the shut down of all southbound lanes at Route 123 all day Tuesday.
In a Twitter message, the U.S. Park Police said that the GW Parkway “is open – one right lane closure SB at Windy Run is in place. All lanes will be open for morning commute.”
Around 4:30 a.m., the police said that crews were finishing up some work on the GW Parkway at Windy Run. Drivers can only get by in that section in the right lane at this time, they said.
Both of the southbound lanes on the parkway are expected to fully reopen soon, although police said they did not have a specific time on the reopening. Late Tuesday night, highway officials had said the roadway’s southbound lanes would fully reopen by 5 a.m.
The Tuesday shutdown of the parkway caused major traffic delays in the morning commute.

One southbound lane of the George Washington Memorial Parkway was reopened Tuesday night after repair of a large sinkhole which shut down the lanes at Route 123 since Monday night.
However, the U.S. Park Police said that one southbound lane of the parkway remained closed at Windy Run. Sgt. Lelani Woods said it would reopen at 4 a.m. Wednesday.
Updated at 4:01 p.m.
As work continued to repair a large sinkhole on the George Washington Memorial Parkway, Federal Highway Administration spokesman Doug Hecox said he expected the road would be entirely open to traffic by 5 a.m.
Updated at 12:46 p.m.
Work is underway to repair a large sinkhole on the southbound lanes of the George Washington Memorial Parkway at Route 123, and officials now say they expect the roadway to reopen before Wednesday morning’s rush hour.
“The backfilling is underway,” said Doug Hecox, a spokesman for the Federal Highway Administration. “We have equipment ready to begin the paving as soon as the backfilling is finished.” He said the sinkhole is being backfilled with dirt and rock.
“The current estimate,” Hecox said, is that the parkway would reopen “tomorrow before rush hour.” But he cautioned that he did not know exactly when that would be and that officials still needed to coordinate with the U.S. Park Police, the agency that helps oversees the roadway.
The southbound lanes of the GW Parkway in that area have been closed since early Tuesday morning and created a headache for commuters, with some people reporting drives of up to three hours to reach their destinations.
Hecox said federal highway crews that are now at the site have found that the sinkhole is “not as large as it was originally estimated to be.” Officials now say the sinkhole measures 10 feet by 5 feet.
Updated at 11:05 a.m.
Federal Highway officials said it is likely to take crews more than five or six hours to fix a large pothole that closed the southbound lanes of the George Washington Parkway at Route 123 on Tuesday morning.
Fixing a sinkhole of this size typically takes five to six hours — if conditions are dry and warm. But with the cold temperatures and rainy conditions, it is expected to take longer. Officials said that means it is likely that the parkway’s southbound lanes will remain closed through Tuesday evening’s rush hour and could be closed into Wednesday morning’s rush hour, as well.
“With the cold, it is likely all of the work will be done late tonight,” said Doug Hecox, a spokesman at the Federal Highway Administration. He said it will be up to the U.S. Park Police to decide when to reopen the road. Just before 11 a.m., Sgt. Lelani Woods, a spokeswoman for the park police, said in an e-mail: “It is still unknown as to how long the closures will be in effect, however, with weather permitting repair efforts can begin soon.”
One problem in fixing the sinkhole, highway officials said, is that it depends on how the asphalt reacts with the wet weather.
“Asphalt requires warmer weather and prefers drier weather,” Hecox said. “When you have water and colder weather, it complicates the behavior of the pavement.” He said crews may have to put asphalt down in chunks and may have to go back over it with a paver several times.
Federal highway officials said that roughly 60,000 vehicles a day travel that segment of the George Washington Parkway. They estimate that roughly 100,000 vehicles were affected by the closure of the GW Parkway on Tuesday morning.
Hecox said that when that portion of the GW Parkway is “out of commission, those drivers are forced onto other routes.”
“It could be that 100,000 drivers are inconvenienced by this little hole,” he said. “It is all the more reason for us to work quickly.”
He said a crew of roughly a dozen people is working to repair the roadway. “It is a heavily traveled route,” Hecox said. “We can’t afford for that road to be closed for that long.”
He said the Federal Highway Administration learned of the sinkhole around 7 p.m. Monday. Crews had to wait until daybreak Tuesday to get a better sense of the size of the hole and figure out what equipment would be needed to fix it.
The exact cause of the sinkhole is unknown, but Hecox said it could be “due to geological structures underneath” or potholes. He said the recent warm — and then cold — temperatures in the area can also create something that is known as a “freeze thaw,” where pavement expands and contracts. “That can aggravate existing potholes and make it bigger,” he said.
Updated at 9:58 a.m.
Highway officials said the George Washington Parkway southbound lanes will likely remain closed for Tuesday evening’s rush hour and not reopen until Wednesday morning.
At 9:54 a.m., Federal Highway Administration officials said equipment was coming from another project on the Clara Barton Parkway and work to fix the sinkhole on the GW Parkway’s southbound lanes at Route 123 would begin “within the next hour.” Officials said workers would begin to remove pavement and backfill the hole Tuesday afternoon.
Doug Hecox, a spokesman at the Federal Highway Administration, said the conditions of rain are “not favorable” for fixing and repaving the sinkhole. But he said, “given the tens of thousands of drivers that cont on that route, we’re going to pave in the rain anyway. It will be a rough, ugly patch.” He said it is possible that the southbound lanes of the parkway could open Tuesday but “for now, we anticipate it will be open Wednesday morning.”
Officials also closed the ramps on Interstate 495 of both the inner and outer loops to southbound George Washington Parkway at Exit 43 until further notice so crews could repair the roadway.

Earlier post:
A sinkhole has closed the southbound lanes of the George Washington Parkway at Route 123 Tuesday morning and caused several miles of traffic backups in the surrounding area. The roadway will be closed in the southbound direction until at least noon, federal highway officials said.
The southbound lanes are closed between Route 123 and Spout Run Parkway.
The hole at its surface, according to U.S. Park Police officials, measures roughly six feet wide by three feet long. But federal highway officials said their engineers have found that the size of the hole below the surface is larger. Hecox said just before 9 a.m. that the sinkhole measures 25 feet wide by 3 feet wide “from one side to the other side.” He said there is a “bigger void below the visible hole.”
“You’re just seeing the top of the hole,” Hecox said. Engineers on the scene, he said, are saying the sinkhole is 25 feet wide “from the furthest part of the void.”
“It is a big empty spot,” Hecox said. “There is a larger hole. A lot of that is underneath the pavement and you can’t see it.”
The sinkhole was discovered around 7 p.m. Monday when there was a crash involving four vehicles along the parkway, according to Sgt. Lelani Woods, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Park Police. There were no reports of injuries. Woods said it is possible that the hole may have started as a pothole and gotten larger because of weather conditions.

On Tuesday morning, there were reports of several miles of backups on the GW Parkway and some surrounding roads. U.S. Park Police  advised drivers to use alternate routes into the District, including Clara Barton Parkway, Route 50 and Glebe Road. But some drivers reported traffic was backed up along those roads as well.
Metro said its buses in the Rosslyn area are having to take alternate routes because of the sinkhole problem. At 8:30, its buses on the 15K and 15L routes were running up to one hour late in both directions.
“Traffic is backed up,” Woods said. Traffic southbound on Route 123 is bumper-to-bumper and commuters are seeing tail lights, as far back as Interstate 495, she said. Drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Virginia Department of Transportation officials said just before 8 a.m. that there were roughly four-mile backups along Interstate 495 north as a spillover from the GW Parkway closure.
GW Pkwy users: With traffic diverted to 123 for sinkhole repairs, consider alt routes to DC from Beltway–50, Clara Barton, Glebe, etc.

Sinkholes often open unexpectedly and can cause major damage. In April, a street in the Charles Village neighborhood of Baltimore collapsed, washing away cars and flooding CSX railroad tracks.
Here’s a look at sinkholes around the world .

A major stretch of the southbound lanes of the George Washington Memorial Parkway in Arlington and Fairfax counties is closed Tuesday morning because of a large sinkhole.
The sinkhole developed Monday night. The GW Parkway is closed between Route 123 and Spout Run Parkway. The sinkhole is located just south of Route 123.
The closure is expected to last through Tuesday morning’s rush hour, according to the U.S. Park Police. The northbound lanes of the parkway are open.

Honda Admits Underreporting Serious U.S. Accidents
Sending money back home to India gets costlier for NRIsTeam Money Today        Edition: December 2014
(Photo: Reuters)
There is bad news for non-resident Indians ( NRIs ) who remit money back home. The government has decided to levy a 12.36% service tax on fee or commission paid by agents for facilitating remittances . This means sending money home would become costlier.
The Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) has clarified that the service tax will be only on the commission paid to Indian agents and not on the total amount remitted.
According to CBEC, "No service tax is payable per se on the amount of foreign currency remitted to India from overseas. As the remittance comprises money, it does not in itself constitute any service in terms of the definition of 'service."
A person in a foreign country can send money in India through a money transfer agent/bank based in that country. The money transfer agent charges a commission from the sender for his service. The agent takes the service of another agency based in India to deliver the money.
While in some cases, the agent in India do not charge any fee from the receiver and only get a part of the commission from the overseas agent, in some cases the agent in India may charge a fee or commission from the receiver.
The service tax would be levied only on the fee/commission received by the Indian agent as the overseas agent is not based in Indian tax territory.
"It should be noted that the only the commission/ fee charged by the Indian agent would be subject to service tax and not the actual quantum of funds being transferred by the overseas remitter to the Indian beneficiary," says Rakesh Nangia, managing partner, Nangia & Co.
The government had earlier introduced the service tax in 2012 but had to withdraw it due to protest and pressure.
"Now with the rupee stabilising with strong inflows, this decision has been taken. This would increase the cost of sending remittances to India," says Amit Maheshwari, Partner, Ashok Maheshwary & Associates.
India is a major recipient of global remittance. In 2013, it received $71 billion, the largest by any country, from across the globe. According to Overseas Indians Ministry, Indian diaspora settled in various countries abroad remitted $189.3 billion from 2010-11 to 2012-13.

Feds: Takata Faces Fine Unless It Widens Air Bag Recall
Movie production firms attract investorsAjita Shashidhar      Follow @AjitaShashidhar    Edition: Dec 7, 2014
(Illustration: Raj Verma)
In March, Abundantia Entertainment, a production house -cum-studio, raised an undisclosed amount from strategic investors RW Media and Callista Capital. The two entities together picked up a 49 per cent stake in Abundantia, promoted by Vikram Malhotra, former Chief Operating Officer of Viacom 18 Motion Pictures. RW Media is a Mumbai-based media and television production company owned by investment banker Ashok Wadhwa while Callista Capital is a Singapore-based private equity firm.
It marked the first time an Indian content production company had got private equity funding. In fact, this year has also seen the emergence of three content funds in the country. Indus Media Capital announced a $50 million fund in June this year, founded by former Reliance Entertainment Chief Financial Officer Venkat Devarajan along with Naveen Chathappuram and Charles Leslie both of whom have decades of film financing experience in Hollywood.
Similarly, Gurinder Chadha of Bend It Like Beckham fame along with Hollywood film financier A.V.T Shankardass (who has financed films such as Captain America and Man of Steel) and Elisa Alvares, who was earlier with the Future Film Group in the UK, have launched a $30 million fund in India, Bend It Media.
"We are an offshore-based fund focusing on the diaspora audience," says Shankardass, Managing Director, Bend It Media. While both these funds plan to invest in Indian as well as Hollywood content, film distributor Rakesh Sippy has recently launched a Rs 200 crore film distribution-cum-production fund, HBS Raksha Movies Fund, that would invest only in Bollywood films.
Gung-ho on Indian cinema
Over the years, the investor community has shied away from funding Indian content production companies, unconvinced about their business model. While they still remain wary, they are definitely seeing these companies in a new light. So, what has changed? Film funds are not new in India. Funds like Religare-Vistaar died a slow death after investing in big budget films such as Mausam and Victory, which flopped miserably. "The content industry was ridden with issues like poor governance, lack of scale, opaque cash dealings and so on," points out Jagat Dave, Managing Director of the Ashok Wadhwa-promoted investment bank Ambit Corporate Finance. But with the corporatisation of the industry many of these concerns have been addressed.
"A large part of the industry was run by individuals. So, the scale and the capability was never institutionalised"
VIKRAM MALHOTRA
CEO/MD, Abundantia Entertainment
The credit for corporatisation goes to the film studios such as UTV and Eros. A studio creates content and also distributes and markets it. It often acquires the content from a production company or even co-produces it. Some 10 years ago, filmmaking was completely passion driven, where a producer often went horribly over budget to produce a great film, and even if the film did well at the box office, profits were a distant dream. "A large part of the industry was run by individuals. So, the scale and the capability was never institutionalised," says Malhotra, CEO and Managing Director, Abundantia Entertainment. The corporatised studios have tried to change that by bringing in financial discipline and also opting for a slate of releases, consisting of some big films and some small films, to de-risk their business and also to build scale. "If they did 10 to 12 movies across genres if one or two didn't work, the others did. So, larger studios decided to have a slate, they were corporatised, they were making money and they used that leverage to scale up," explains Dave of Ambit.
Along with the likes of Chennai Express or Dabangg, the studios also invested in smaller budget, content-driven films like a Queen or Kahaani. While the big budget, star-studded films Chennai Express got the studios the glamour quotient and revenue, the smaller budget films actually got them handsome returns. Films like Vicky Donor and The Lunchbox were made on shoestring budgets of a couple of crores, but they got the studios revenues upwards of Rs 20 crore. Projects such as these helped the studios even out the losses they made on flops such as Himmatwala or a Joker.
The learning curve of the studios has helped the content production companies, says Madhu Mantena, Co-founder, Phantom Films, a film production company, who has been in the market scouting for strategic investment. "We are consistently trying to come out with good, marketable films at good costs and get decent RoIs (returns on investment)," he says.
In fact, Malhotra says he is clear that Abundantia would operate as a hybrid motion pictures company, that wouldn't be involved in acquiring and trading films, but would be involved in developing and nurturing content, producing it and marketing it as well. For instance, Abunduntia is currently working with film director Neeraj Pandey on his upcoming film Baby, starring Akshay Kumar. Here, Malhotra's team has been involved in the process of seeing the script evolve, casting the film and even working on the ensemble. "By doing so, we are able to avoid paying premiums attached to acquisitions of films, we know the nature of content we are backing, we filter out what typically wouldn't work in a film at an early stage. It allows us to keep the hit ratio very high," explains Malhotra.
Taking all these aspects into consideration, along with the high levels of corporate governance and a great team, it makes Abundantia a compelling property for the investor community, says entertainment lawyer, Ameet B. Naik, Managing Partner, Naik Naik & Co. "If you have someone like Ashok Wadhwa who is a businessman and understands finance and Vikram Malhotra who has a corporate background and understands filmmaking very well coming together, it will be a successful model in the times to come," says Naik, who is optimistic that the Indian content industry will see more such investor-led deals in the times to come. "Filmmakers are increasingly seeing the element of dhanda (business), as there is money to be made and there is RoI also," says Naik.
The film business is also seeing the rise of younger generation entrepreneurs, who are not only into making good content but are also keen to work in a more corporatised set up. The entire idea of setting up a film fund was to corporatise the business, points out Sippy of HBS Raksha Movies Fund. His father, Ramesh Sippy, has been distributing Bollywood films in and around Mumbai for decades. "The idea was to escalate the business. We already have the knowledge, the expertise as well as contacts, so now all that we are doing is capitalise on it and build a more structured business."
The other big reason for investors/funds looking at content production companies in a different light is the emergence of multiple platforms to monetise content. "Earlier you had traditional music rights and box office collections. Now you have cable and satellite rights, digital rights, online streaming, value added services on DTH and cable. That also aids for better economics for all the players," points out Dave of Ambit.
EYEING REGIONAL CONTENT
Two out of the three recently set up content funds are looking at funding regional films, especially south Indian films. Devarajan of Indus Media Capital says that the acquisition costs of a Malayalam or Tamil film is far lower than Bollywood. "In the south, unlike Bollywood, we get good opportunities at a low cost. A movie can be made in Rs 4 crore to Rs 5 crore, and the same time it is sellable. In Hindi, if you make a film within Rs 1 crore to Rs 2 crore we will not even get a release. South India gives us an opportunity for a sellable cost effective product."
"I look forward to investing in remakes of South Indian films, as these kind of films invariably have a high hit ratio"
RAKESH SIPPY
Founder, HBS Raksha Movies Fund
Devarajan's partner, Chathappuram clarifies that they are not averse to Bollywood. Instead, their plan is to enter Bollywood by selling the intellectual property of films made in the south. After all, a large proportion of the Bollywood blockbusters are remakes of South Indian films. "A film like Dushyant was made for Rs 5 crore and in Kerala itself it made Rs 75 crore. The Telegu version is a hit. So, the idea is to take a small product and nurture it and monetise the lifecycle of it."
Similarly, Sippy's family distribution business Raksha Films has made maximum money by distributing films such as Singham which are remakes of south Indian films. "I will look forward to investing in remakes of south Indian films, as these kind of films invariably have a high hit ratio. Eventually, regional films are also something I am keen to look at," says Sippy.
TELEVISION CONTENT

Private equity companies such as Providence Equity Partners or Relativity have made substantial investments in global entertainment companies such as The Chernin Group (a global company run by media baron Peter Chernin) which invests not only in films but also television content. The new content funds in India like Indus Media Capital or Bend It Media are open to investing in TV content, but not in the Indian soap operas or reality shows. The intent clearly is to invest in content that appeals to the diaspora audience.
Indian TV is not under the consideration of global investors because local production houses don't own the intellectual property (IP) rights of the content. This is unlike popular international sitcoms, such as Friends, where the IP is owned by the production house. The Indian producers work for a fee with a broadcaster who has full ownership of the IP. So, Ekta Kapoor of Balaji Films may have produced the country's most popular soap opera, Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi, but the IP rights of the show is with Star India. "People will not buy into a TV content company in India as there is no IP, the strategic value is low. Globally formats are owned by production houses, who can syndicate it in different geographies, languages and get scale," explains Dave of Ambit.
The only TV content company in India that has got private equity funding is the local arm of Endemol, which has got investment from Peter Chernin's CA Media. Vivek Raicha, Head of Investments, CA Media India, says the only reason why his fund considered Endemol was because it was able to retain the IP of its content. The makers of popular reality shows, such as Bigg Boss and Khatron Ke Khiladi, the production house produces shows in multiple languages and Raicha says that it has been able to do so only because it owns the IP of the formats. "IP provides you leverage with the distribution of content."
TV content companies in India are unable to hold the IP of their content because they are individual-run boutiques and don't have adequate financial muscle. Even the largest production company in India, Balaji Films, has a revenue of just Rs 200 crore. Ekta Kapoor may be large in that business but she negotiates with broadcasters who are much larger.
Indian content makers are going all out to put systems in place. Are we going to see more investment coming into Indian content companies in the months to come? While many agree that the industry is beginning to attract investors, they also feel that a lot will depend on the kind of experience some of the early birds, such as Abundantia Entertainment, have with their investments. "They have to demonstrate that this business if run the right way can make money," sums up Dave of Ambit.
HOLLYWOOD VS BOLLYWOOD
It makes more sense to invest in Hollywood films rather than Bollywood ones
Hollywood
Why is Hollywood a better investment bet than Bollywood? A large part of the money raised by both Indus Media Capital and Bend It Media would be going into Hollywood projects. Hollywood has a 100-year-old system in place which makes investments less riskier, points out Naveen Chathappuram of Indus Media Capital.
The highlight of this system is a tripartite agreement that a financier has with a completion services company and the producer. If the producer is not able to complete the film, the completion services company steps in as a guarantor and underwrites the risk of the financier and takes over the production of the film. "These kind of bonding deals are unlikely to happen in India as the producers don't allow their films to be taken over," remarks Ameet B. Naik of Naik Naik & Co.
Apart from the mandatory completion bond that every filmmaker needs to sign, Hollywood has certain best practices which brings in a high degree of efficiencies. For instance, a Spielberg film usually shoots for 60 days, whereas a bigger budget Indian film shoots for 150 to 200 days. "An Indian film usually preps (rehearsals, mock shoots) for two weeks before the film and then they prep during the course of the shoot. However, in Hollywood, if the shoot is for 40 days you will prep for 80 days before that," explains Chathappuram. "You orchestrate everything that will happen during the shoot, so the actual process of shoot is just executing what you have in mind." Clearly, it will be a while before Bollywood can match the professionalism of Hollywood.

Black Friday Shoppers Brawl Over Barbies  TVs  Bargainsreddit
All's fair in love and ... shopping?
As Black Friday bargain hunters continue to swarm stores across the country in their attempt to snag the best deals, reports have started emerging of shoppers growing violent in the frenzy for discounted wares.
At a Houston-area Walmart on Thursday night, police reportedly intervened after a fight broke out following a scramble for discounted Samsung flatscreen TVs. A video , said to have been taken at the Texas store, shows shoppers lying on top of the TVs on the ground, apparently in an attempt to prevent other people from buying them.
Also on Thursday, sheriff's deputies were called to a Walmart store in Norwalk, California, after two women started fighting over a Barbie doll , according to CBS Los Angeles. At least one of the women is reported to have thrown a punch.
"The whole thing was pretty stupid," a shopper told the news outlet. "That was very dumb."
At a Walmart in Michigan City, Indiana, another video on YouTube allegedly shows people tussling over $88 subwoofers . "Oh my God, that is crazy," one woman can be heard saying in the video as customers scrambled for the electronics.
KTLA reported that three shoppers at a Kohl's store in Tustin, California, were arrested early Friday following a shopping-related altercation. The shoppers included two women and one juvenile , said KABC-TV.
Two shoppers -- a man and his girlfriend -- were also arrested at an Indianapolis mall early Friday after they allegedly attacked an off-duty police officer. WXIN reports that the man had started a fight with another man in the parking lot after being ejected from the mall for being "too rowdy." An off-duty officer then tried to break up the fight, but the man and his girlfriend allegedly attacked him. The two individuals were subsequently arrested.
Elsewhere in the country, bargain hunters lined up for hours to get into their favorite stores. Plenty of "shoving" and general frenzy has been reported.
Shoppers head into Target just after their doors opened at midnight on Black Friday in South Portland, Maine.
Macy's opens its doors at 6 p.m. for Black Friday in New York City.
People enter a J.C. Penney store at the Newport Mall on Thursday in Jersey City, New Jersey.
This year, Black Friday brawls have also been reported across the pond in the U.K.

Why Take Home Salary is Lesser Than CTCYou are here: Home Your Money
Difference Between CTC and Take Home Salary Explained
BankBazaar.com | Updated On: December 09, 2014 11:35 (IST)
Salaries in India Likely to Rise by 10.5% in 2015: Report
Ankit Sharma, 22, an engineering graduate, was happy as he got placement through campus interview and was offered a salary package of Rs 3.6 lakh annual CTC (cost to company). From the first day, he started planning how he wanted to spend his first salary. But his excitement was dimished when he received the much-awaited pay slip.
Before joining a workforce, many generally have a misconception that the actual take home salary is same as CTC. But in reality, there is huge difference between the two.
Why CTC is different from pay slip
When Ankit rechecked the details he found that there are many components in CTC which he won't receive. The HR department at his new office gave him the break up and said that his maximum entitled limit was only Rs 22,491 a month where according to the CTC offered, he thought it would be Rs 30,150. It was explained to him that the employer's contribution to provident fund was part of the CTC but not of his salary.
The same logic is applicable for the company's contribution towards employees' medical insurance as well.
Income tax and professional tax also got deducted from Ankit's CTC. He would get Rs 22,491 only if he touched the maximum limit of overtime and upon submission of medical bills worth Rs 15,000.
Break-up of CTC and tax liability is given below:
Component of salary
PF (12% of basic salary)
28,800
Break up of take home salary:
Deductions/take home salary
Tax (10% of taxable amount)
28,800
Employee provident fund (12% of basic salary)
28,800
22,491
Components of salary
Basic salary: Basic salary is the core salary and it is the fixed part of the compensation package. A number of other components are calculated in the basic salary. Generally, the basic salary depends upon the employee's designation or grade.
Allowance: Different types of allowance is given to employees such as house rent allowance (HRA), leave travel allowance (LTA), dearness allowance, convince allowance, city compensation allowance and children's education allowance.
Perquisites: It is basically different facilities such as rent free accommodations, car facility, interest subsidy on loan, reimbursement on medical bills and club facility.
Contribution to provident fund: Contribution to the provident fund is mandatory for Indian companies. Twelve per cent of the basic salary gets contributed from the employee for PF and another 12 per cent by the employer. So 24 per cent of the basic salary gets deducted.
Reimbursement: Sometimes employees are entitled to many reimbursements such as medical treatment, newspaper, phone bill etc. One would not get the money in salary but funds will be passed against submission of such bills. So these are not included to the monthly pay slip. Most of the cases, an upper limit is there for each category.
Life and health insurance: New joinees get excited when they come to know that their organisation is taking care of them and paying the premium of their life and health insurance. But in reality, it is included in the CTC.
Transport facility: Getting a car from office may sound really good but actually, transport facility or pick-and-drop facility is also a component of the package. The interest-free car loans are not actually free.
Subsidised meals: It is true that really there is no free lunch. Free lunch, subsidised meals from office canteen, food coupons even the tea or coffee come with a price tag to the employee.
Rent of the office space: It is surprising but true that sometimes the rent of office space (the space in the employee's cabin) is borne by the employee in his CTC.
Making the most of your CTC
One has to understand the basic difference CTC and take home salary:
CTC = Direct benefits + indirect benefits + saving contributions
Whereas,
Take Home Salary = Direct benefits - employee PF - other deductions if any - income tax
While negotiating with a new employer, one should try to increase the direct benefit part of CTC. For instance, if an organisation is offering transportation, which is an indirect benefit, the employee should try to get it as conveyance allowance which is a direct benefit. Negotiation can be done to convert the subsidised meals to food allowance again to convert indirect benefit to direct benefit
Many organisations offer ESI benefits for employee's health. But there are only few ESI (Employee's State Insurance) hospitals where the facility is available. If the employee is offered medical reimbursement, it benefits him more. One can also ask for family health insurance and medical reimbursement instead of the employee alone. Even if the total coverage or the maximum limit of reimbursement is the same for individual or family, it will minimise expenditure.
House rent allowance gives some tax rebate. Up to a certain limit, conveyance allowance is tax free. So this is a must-include in the compensation package instead of a pick-and-drop facility. Before accepting an offer from the new employer, you should try to know the company policy. The tax liability of allowances and perquisites vary from one company to another.
Conclusion
Take home salary can also be increased with the help of proper tax planning. If a person invests Rs 1.5 lakh in tax saving instruments under Section 80C such as PPF, Equity-Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) etc., then he/she can save tax. Although this would not alter the CTC, the take home salary will be increased.

Walmart Black Friday Protests Hit Call For  $15 And Full TimeWalmart Black Friday Protests Hit Major Cities With Calls For '$15 And Full Time'

reddit
WASHINGTON -- Dirk Rasmussen had Friday off and could have slept in if he wanted to. Instead, the Maryland resident and Teamster rose early and drove to downtown Washington, eager to join a post-Thanksgiving protest against Walmart.
"Our local [union] president encouraged us to take part," said Rasmussen, 58, who works in a lumber and building-supply warehouse. "I raised eight children on a Teamsters benefit package and Teamsters wage. I'm a firm believer in collective bargaining, and I'm very concerned about the security of this next generation."
Black Friday may be most famous for doorbuster shopping deals, but among progressives it's becoming a regular holiday for labor demonstrations. Friday marked the third consecutive year of scattered but highly visible protests against Walmart. Demonstrators, along with an unknown number of Walmart strikers, are calling for better pay and scheduling practices from the world's largest retailer.
On Thursday and Friday, photos on Twitter tagged with #walmartstrikers showed sizable protests in D.C., Pittsburgh, Northern New Jersey, Los Angeles, Long Beach, Calif., and St. Paul, Minn., among other areas. The protests were led by OUR Walmart, a union-backed worker group, alongside community and labor groups in different cities.

Dan Schlademan, campaign director of Making Change at Walmart, a project of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, said on a call with reporters Friday that he expects the number of strikers to be in the hundreds by the end of the day, though the group could not provide a specific number of workers who'd submitted strike notices to their bosses.
"All the signs that we're seeing is that this is going to be the biggest day ever," Schlademan said.
Brooke Buchanan, a spokeswoman for Walmart, told HuffPost that the retailer was more concerned with serving its customers than with protests it views as union stunts. According to Buchanan, more than 22 million shoppers came to Walmart stores on Thanksgiving alone this year.
"We're really focused on our customers," Buchanan said. "We've got millions of customers coming in [on Thanksgiving] and Friday, and we're making sure they have a safe and exciting shopping experience."
In D.C., a crowd estimated at 200 to 400 people assembled outside the Walmart store on H Street Northwest, calling on the retailer to commit to "$15 and full time" -- a wage of $15 per hour, the same rate demanded by fast-food strikers, and a full-time schedule for those who want it. One of OUR Walmart's top criticisms of the retailer is that part-time workers don't get enough hours.
The protest was large enough to draw the D.C. police, who stood at the store's doors and dispersed the crowd after about an hour.
Melinda Gaino, an employee at the store, said she would be missing three shifts this week while on strike. Gaino took part in a sit-down strike on Wednesday inside the H Street store, where she and other protesters sat on the floor with tape over their mouths, calling on Walmart to end what they called the silencing of workers.
Gaino, a 45-year-old mother of four, said she joined OUR Walmart in August out of concern with some of the challenges faced by her colleagues. Many workers, she said, don't get enough hours to support their families.
"This has given me more confidence," Gaino, who earns $9.90 per hour, said of going on strike. "I said I've come this far, so I may as well go all in."

Bergdorf Goodman s Black Friday Sale Is Nothing Like The Frenzy ElsewhereBergdorf Goodman's Swanky Black Friday Sale Is Nothing Like The Usual Frenzy Elsewhere

NEW YORK -- While millions of shoppers battle their way through hysterical crowds to save a buck at stores like Walmart and Target on Black Friday, some who have more cash to spend are enjoying the more refined side of the annual weekend of shopping mania.
They're partaking in Bergdorf Goodman's Black Friday sale. Yes, Fifth Avenue's storied monument of luxury holds a special event on a day known for mass discounts and wild fights for merchandise. And it's nothing like the frenzies across the country, which started on Thanksgiving night. While some battled for Barbie dolls , brawled over baby clothes or got zapped with a stun gun , those who can afford to shop at Bergdorf's waited until morning.
The luxury department store is calm before its 8 a.m. opening, prepping for a 12-hour day. A few shoppers wait outside each of the many revolving-door entrances. There are no barricades. No lines. No tent cities. No cheering. No fanfare. Just employees waiting patiently inside and customers waiting patiently outside. When it's time, the greeters wave them in and the shopping begins.
One worker chuckles and reports to his colleagues that there were about 20 shoppers who came in through his door. Another replies that seven customers entered on his side. It takes a couple of seconds to get the waiting customers into the store, as smiling employees hand out $50 gift cards to be redeemed on the beauty products. In the jewelry area, every room glistens under the lights.
A holiday display of coats inside Bergdorf Goodman on Black Friday. Most merchandise isn't on sale, even today.
The Black Friday sales here aren't like the ones from the lower reaches of retail -- Bergdorf is simply too exclusive for that. Where Gap flaunts 50 percent off everything in the store, Bergdorf just offers an extra 20 percent off already marked-down clothes, shoes and handbags on the fifth floor. Some designer sportswear is on sale at 40 percent off, too. Though there are some deeply discounted items at Bergdorf on Friday, it manages to retain its exclusive feel.
That exclusivity is what attracts people to Bergdorf's extravagant halls. Founded in 1899 and now owned by Neiman Marcus Group, the department store sells all sorts of luxury goods: clothes, shoes, handbags, jewelry, housewares and more. It has only two locations, the main store and a men's store right across the street on Fifth Avenue, near the southeast corner of Central Park.
Many shoppers head downstairs to the beauty floor, where there are a wide array of branded kiosks. Bergdorf offers plenty of Black Friday perks down here: complimentary brow lessons from Bobbi Brown, depuffing facials from Amore Pacific and reflexology hand massages from La Prairie.
Others head up to the fifth floor, which features contemporary designer goods. The racks are filled with brands like Helmut Lang, Rag & Bone and Phillip Lim. There are $1,200 Tamara Mellon dresses, $200 tops from Theory and $500 sweaters from Elie Tahari all marked down. The shoppers quietly look through the garments, seeking the standouts. They find plenty and bring their hauls to nearby workers who ring up the purchases.
On the fifth floor of Bergdorf Goodman, the sales floor is filled with marked-down merchandise from contemporary designers.
A little less than an hour after opening, the sales floor gets busier. But it's not raucous and nobody's acting frantic. The loudest noise comes from the racks themselves, squeaking sharply each time someone slides over a hanger. Then, a supervisor's voice cuts through the room. "I hate to be the bearer of bad news," he tells a pair of his employees chatting softly near one of the racks, "but less conversation, more work." Everything remains tidy, employees darting around to make sure the area remains pristine. It's unclear how big of an event this is for Bergdorf -- a company representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Though it's Black Friday, this is still where the affluent go to spend thousands and thousands of dollars on clothes. The vast majority of merchandise in the store remains at full price, maintaining its luxe integrity. These areas churn onward, glitzy money-making machines that are too swank for discounts.
On the second floor, women gleefully try on red-soled Christian Louboutin heels, none of which cost less than $675. And on the ground floor, surrounded by staggeringly pricey handbags from the likes of Saint Laurent and Givenchy, a saleswoman sees one of her regulars. "Nancy!" she exclaims, eager to unveil her latest wares. "It just came in."

Black Friday Was The Second-Biggest Day Ever For Background ChecksThe FBI dealt with more background checks this Black Friday than ever before on the annual shopping day, according to a CNN report on Saturday.
Only once in its history has the agency had to handle a larger number of background checks in a single day: Friday, Dec. 21, 2012 , exactly one week after the Sandy Hook school shooting .
All told, the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) ran more than 175,000 background checks on Friday. The agency typically handles about one-third of that on a more normal day, according to CNN.
The record number of requests for background checks isn't surprising. In fact, it's perfectly in line with recent trends. As HuffPost reporter Kim Bhasin wrote last year:
Gun-buying after Thanksgiving is becoming something of a holiday tradition. In each of the past two years, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has reported a record number of calls for background checks for gun purchases on the Friday after Thanksgiving. A flood of 154,873 calls on Black Friday in 2012, nearly three times the daily average that year, caused outages at some of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System's call centers.
But the growing number of Black Friday requests does present a challenge for the agency. By law, NICS has only three business days to complete a background check . After that, the decision to sell a firearm rests with the dealer.
As a result of that small window, the agency had roughly 600 of its employees logging long hours to make sure it completed as many background checks as possible on Friday. "No one is allowed to take leave today," Kimberly Del Greco, an FBI manager with NICS, told NPR on Friday . The FBI even asked some former employees to help with the workload, FBI spokesman Stephen Fischer told CNN.
As Philip Bump at The Washington Post notes, background checks are " an imperfect metric for approximating total gun sales ." That's primarily because of two reasons: One background check can lead to the purchase of multiple firearms by a single individual, and certain individuals are able to purchase guns without a background check ever being completed because of the aforementioned three-days rule.
Nevertheless, the number of background checks being requested can be a useful indicator of general gun ownership trends. And according to the FBI website, all 10 of the top 10 highest weeks for background checks since 1998 have occurred in the past couple of years.
More than 12,000 people in the U.S. died as a result of gun violence in 2013. The FBI was not immediately available for comment.

Samsung s Mobile Chief Keeps His JobSpiceJet Cancellations Trigger Chaos At Airports
Seoul: Samsung said on Monday the head of its faltering mobile business would keep his job despite an alarming decline in profits, as the electronics giant announced a year-end personnel reshuffle.
A number of leading executives were moved or promoted, but the three co-CEOs of Samsung Electronics all retained their posts, including J.K. Shin, components unit chief Kwon Oh-Hyun and the head of the consumer electronics division B.K. Yoon.
Shin's position had been seen as particularly vulnerable, as the mobile unit that was responsible for Samsung's extraordinary run of record profits in recent years was also behind the slump in the past two quarters.
Shin "made many contributions in making Samsung Electronics the world's top mobile handset maker", Samsung Group spokesman Lee June told reporters.
"We believe he would have a chance to help (Samsung) make another jump in this changing environment in the future," Lee said.
Shin, 58, has led Samsung Electronics' mobile unit since 2012 and played a key role in the South Korean giant's rise to become the world's top smartphone maker.
But the firm recently saw profits squeezed by escalating competition with Apple's iPhones in the high-end market and cheap handsets of Chinese rivals like Xiaomi in the low-end segment.
Samsung posted a 50-per cent drop in third-quarter net profit, following a 20 per cent drop in the previous quarter.
The net profit for the July-September period was the lowest for nearly three years.
Samsung produces a range of products from handsets to memory chips and TVs but the mobile business comprises the lion's share of its overall sales.
The family-run company is currently embarking on a major restructuring programme ahead of a generational ownership succession.
Last week it announced the $1.7 billion sale of stakes in four affiliates and a $2.0 billion share buyback.
Samsung's share price has tumbled more than 10 per cent this year as growth in the key smartphone business begins to lose steam.

Cyanogen-Micromax deal may hit OnePlus One launchOnePlus One launch in doubt after Cyanogen-Micromax deal
indiatoday.in        Last Updated: December 1, 2014  | 10:50 IST
OnePlus is supposed to launch its OnePlus One phone, a phone powered by CyanogenMod, in India on December 2. But after Cyanogen Inc announced an exclusive partnership with Micromax on Friday, there is seems to be some confusion around the launch.
Micromax and Cyanogen said that the CyanogenMod OS will be exclusively available to only Micromax phones in India.
The announcement has surprised OnePlus . Responding to a query on Twitter, the company co-founder Carl Pei said that the launch of the phone was still on schedule. "Our fans have done nothing wrong. We have done nothing wrong. India has waited long enough," he tweeted.
But it was not clear if the phone would run CyanogenMod or not. One thing is sure that even if the OnePlus One launches with CynaogenMod, it will probably not receive any CyanogenMod updates and in future will see its operating system, at least in India, getting replaced with some other software.
In a "letter" on the company website, Pei said that his firm was building new Android-based operating system for the OnePlus One.
Pei said that already a team is working on the new operating system. "(the) team was put in place originally to build the software which would power our future devices. So, though it's not what we originally planned, we have shifted engineering efforts to the OnePlus One upon hearing this news. According to our current estimations, we'll be able to release our first community build to our Indian users next month and have a production-ready build in February," he wrote.
"Our system will be based on Lollipop, and will be built to be stable, fast, and lightweight. True to our original promise of putting user experience first, it will be bloatware-free and only carry the features important to our users. We appreciate the work that Google has put into Android, and we have no plans of departing from Material Design nor adding unnecessary customizations," Pei added.

November factory growth rises most in 2 yearsNovember factory growth rises most in 2 years
Anu Bararia     Bangalore   Last Updated: December 1, 2014  | 13:11 IST
Factory activity expanded at its fastest pace in nearly two years in November as burgeoning order books led manufacturers to accelerate output, a business survey showed on Monday.
The HSBC Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), compiled by Markit, rose to 53.3 in November from 51.6 in October, its highest since February 2013, and the thirteenth consecutive month of expansion in activity.
A Reuters poll had expected manufacturing activity to lose some steam and predicted the index would fall to 51.2.
New orders were supported by strong domestic demand for consumer goods while foreign orders remained robust. The sub-index soared to a 21-month high of 56.2 from October's 53.0.
The expansion in output encouraged manufacturers to add more jobs.
The survey also showed companies passed on additional input costs to consumers at a faster pace, which could revive inflationary pressures after several months of slowing.
"The pick-up in output prices could partly be signaling some revival in pricing power among businesses," said Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC.
Economic growth slowed to 5.3 percent in the three months to September, from 5.7 percent in the previous quarter, but the Reserve Bank of India is expected to stand pat on interest rates when it meets on Tuesday despite pressure from the government to lower borrowing costs.
The RBI's key lending rate is expected to remain unchanged at 8.0 percent until at least April.

Silicon Valley Bank rallies clients to compete in new ChiTech Food Drive0
The drive also accepts cash donations. Each dollar donated can buy 1.25 pounds of food, Neri said.
If this drive proves successful, Neri said, he hopes to expand it to more companies and SVB offices next year. The bank has more than 30 offices across the world. But first he has to prove SVB’s $1,000 investment in supplies and transportation will pay off.
“We want to make sure from the money we invest, we get a multiplier of food to the community. Otherwise, we might as well have just written a check,” Neri said.
Neri said the goal of the ChiTech Food Drive is to give back to the community, but that it also gives SVB an opportunity to engage and build relationships with its clients.
Marc Halpin, CEO of corporate event planning firm Kapow Events, said his 55 employees in Chicago are competitive and will be excited to support a local cause.
“It’s not difficult to get volunteers or people to support these things,” Halpin said. “I think it’s good for a company to play its part as well as the individual.”

An economic blueprint for Mr. ModiUpdated: December 2, 2014 07:21 IST
An economic blueprint for Mr. Modi
Ashok V Desai
government
The boom under the UPA has ended; to achieve respectable growth, the NDA government will have to do something in terms of reforms and the Prime Minister will have to go beyond simply designing excellent websites and think out of the box
This year has altered the political picture in striking ways. The most conspicuous change is in prime ministers: reclusive, modest, uncommunicative Manmohan Singh has given way to vocal, expressive, dramatic Narendra Modi. A less-noticed change is in the government: Manmohan Singh had 77 Ministers; Modi’s Cabinet has 66 , and the average experience of his Ministers is far briefer. This is only partly because the Congress stayed in power for a decade; Modi has also brought in much fresh blood.
His Ministers talk less — they may have been told to, they may be in awe of him, they may be more self-contained, or they may not have the self-confidence. That is a pity, since some of them are capable of such wonderful faux pas. Manmohan Singh’s Ministers had no compunction about accepting invitations to speak, inaugurating events and displaying themselves; Modi’s Ministers are more circumspect. But Modi’s sound bites dominate official noise, and addicts as well as connoisseurs of politics hang on his words.
It is not just words people hang on. The people who elected him have great hopes of him. “Intuitively, I feel we are sitting at the cusp of one of the biggest changes since 1850,” said a director of TCS. His optimism is shared by the 17 crore voters who brought the Bharatiya Janata Party to power. Expectations are high; it will no doubt want to exceed them.
Topping UPA’s robust growth
That would mean bettering the performance of the preceding UPA government. It was by no means insignificant. The UPA period saw the highest GDP growth rates in India’s history. The annual growth rates of close to 9 per cent between 2005-06 and 2007-08 have been exceeded only once — in 1987-88, when growth shot up because the previous year had seen an unprecedented drought. During UPA’s decade in power, national income almost doubled; income per head went up 69 per cent. These figures are supported by the rise in consumer durable ownership shown by National Sample Survey.
The boom witnessed under the UPA’s tenure has ended; growth in the past two years has been under 5 per cent a year. Industrial growth has collapsed. Even to achieve respectable growth, the NDA government will have to do something, which politicians like to call reforms. But they will be nothing like the reforms of 1991-93. The economy was hobbled with such controls then that all Narasimha Rao had to do was to remove them. “Nara-indra” Modi has no such easy option. He needs to think out of the box.
One idea he had was “ Make in India ”. Make what? There is an excellent new website; the government certainly knows how to make them. It opens with a contrived lion made of racks and pinions. It lists 25 sectors — 14 in industry, five in services, four in transport, and two vague ones, namely space and biotechnology — which are little different from what the old government would have prioritised. It gives pride of place to the Delhi-Mumbai industrial corridor. For the rest, it summarises industrial policy, which repeats all the convolutions of the UPA era. It is remarkable how little it has changed. There is a longing for revolution, but there is no idea of where to go next and how.
“There is longing for revolution, but there is no idea of where to go next and how”
To begin with, is manufacturing worth bothering about? Before the industrial revolution, India was the world’s most industrialised nation; after the revolution, it fell far behind. That has left a longing for lost glory. But the share of manufacturing in GDP has been falling everywhere. The only exception is China, which achieved outstanding growth in the past quarter century through industrialisation. The Chinese story is complex, but some of its components are well-known.
Beginning in the 1970s, China set up an efficient steel industry, which has kept its costs of engineering and construction low. It built world-class railways, highways and ports, which took its manufactures cheaply across the country and the world. Its banks gave cheap loans to industry. It kept its exchange rate competitive. Such closely coordinated policies were possible in China; they have not been in our federal democracy.
India has had its own successes, though not on China’s scale. After the desktop was invented in the late 1970s, demand for packaged, small-scale software boomed in the United States. It ran short of programmers, and took away all whom it could find in India. That led to mass training of programmers in corner shops across South India, where people still knew some English.
They were first exported to the U.S., and later, manned the software industry that emerged in South India, where costs were lower. That was India’s last growth story.
Where might the next one come from? There must be a number of options; every economist can choose his. Mine goes something like this.
India’s Achilles’ heel is electricity: it is expensive and uncertain. My solution for it is twofold.
First, the Centre owns a quarter of power generation capacity, and supplies fuel for over two-thirds of the power. It should give power only to State electricity boards that charge a single price for their power, which must cover long-term costs of generation. State governments must corporatise state electricity boards; if they want to give any consumer subsidies, they must finance them from State budgets. The same principle of long-term viability pricing must be applied to the Centre’s coal, oil and power enterprises.
Second, the Centre must buy floating thermal power plants like those in the West Indies, anchor them in ports, and use them to supply power to those States whose governments corporatise their electricity boards.
Finally, the Centre must abolish all imposts on coal and oil products and create a national energy exchange where they are freely bought and sold; that will minimise the costs of energy. If it must impose taxes, they must be the same per Btu for all forms of energy and only on energy consumed by final users.
As with power, the Centre must create an integrated, efficient transport industry. The railways must offer door-to-door delivery services to every factory, mandi, and port, and give free access to road transport companies. The Centre must build a dozen new medium ports with a draft of 15 meters, and finance the creation of a commercial fleet of Sub-Panamax vessels up to 50,000 tons to provide freight and passenger service along the coast as well as with our neighbouring countries. Sea transport will develop our coastline, move traffic away from crowded and expensive onland routes, and promote our links with the Indian Ocean area.
The SEBI rulebook
The financial industry is overregulated and consequently underdeveloped. Financial institutions are poorly designed. As a result, there is too little capital for small producers and traders, and too little risk capital in general. SEBI’s enormous rulebook and its partiality towards the so-called qualified institutional investors have turned the capital market into an oligopoly; and restrictions on entry into banking and competition have led to collusion between banks and their larger clients.
The underdeveloped mutual fund industry must be merged with the banking industry. Banks must give their clients both loans and equity, in varying combinations; and offer similar hybrid investments to their depositors. In every major city, banks must together create an exchange, trade the equity and loans of their larger and more solid clients on it, and thereby bring knowledge about the clients’ financial worth into the market. The clients should equally be able to borrow or raise equity directly from the market.
This is my initial list of reforms. An economist can theorise and imagine endlessly. But policy is not a product of dreams; it emerges from a bargaining process in which an economist is only one participant. My list would give an idea of how one starts with a problem and applies economic principles to it to draw policy conclusions. Policy is made by policymakers, brought into the public sphere by media, administered by civil servants, enjoyed or suffered by common people and reshaped by democratic processes. Those who are elected may think they have arrived and only have to wave a magic wand; those who have elected them may soar with hope. But good policy requires a robust process of which elections are a small part.
The new government still has to design the process, let alone implement it.

Should stock split matter to you as an investorRahul Oberoi      Follow @iamrahuloberoi    Edition: November 2014
(Photo: Reuters)
A woman goes to a parlour, a fat man visits a gym and companies go for stock splits. All three are an attempt to look attractive.
The Sensex has risen around 25% this year. Market experts are asking people to get ready for a bull run they say will last years. In anticipation, many companies are splitting shares to reduce their price. The aim is to increase affordability and liquidity (number of shares in the market) and attract buyers, especially for possible fund-raising in the future.
For instance, State Bank of India (SBI) has, for the first time ever, approved a 1:10 division of shares. This means investors will get 10 shares for every one share they hold. ICICI Bank, Punjab National Bank (PNB) and Axis Bank have also announced the splitting of their each share into five.
The list does not end here. There are over 50 companies on the Bombay Stock Exchange which had split their shares this year till October 1. In 2013, the count was 67.
But do splits matter for investors? Or are they just an attempt to dress up a company as an investment so that more people become interested in buying its shares?
DK Aggarwal, chairman and managing director, SMC Investments and Advisors, says, "SBI and PNB have announced stock splits but we have not seen any big movement in their share prices as there is enough liquidity in these stocks already. So, these stocks will keep behaving according to fundamentals. On the other hand, Astral Poly rose 45% after the announcement of the split in April as the company's fundamentals were strong but its stock had low liquidity."
Yogesh Nagaonkar, VP, institutional equities, Bonanza Portfolio, says, " A stock split is an attempt play on the investor's psyche. A momentum can be seen in the split stock after the announcement, but it is generally short-lived."
Explaining Stock Split
Stock split involves division of equity shares by lowering their face value. It increases the number of shares outstanding. The day the split is carried out is the record date. After this, shares trade at the new lower price on exchanges.
For an investor, it increases the number of shares that he holds. But there is a corresponding fall in the value of the shares. The market value or capitalisation of the company remains unchanged. For instance, Havells India gave investors five shares for each share held by them. The stock price, as a result, fell by around one-fifth, from Rs 1,246 on August 25 to Rs 272 on August 26. The split did not impact Havells' market capitalisation. However, the trading volume rose from 12,000 on August 25 to 8,42,210 on August 26.
Hence, stock split makes the stock more liquid and affordable (one can make small investments in it). But there is no impact on valuation metrics such as price to equity (PE) or price-to-book value ratios. Future returns also do not change just because a stock has been split.
Sunil Jain, head, equity research , retail, Nirmal Bang Securities, says, "Companies generally split their shares to increase liquidity. When the stock is split, your percentage of ownership doesn't change. Only the number of shares held increases. It does not change the fundamentals of the company. It does not change investor wealth either."
Past Trends
We looked at stocks in the BSE 500 index which were split in the 10 years till October 2013. Of these, we selected top 50 on the basis of market capitalisation. A total of 34 gave positive returns one year from the split. For example, the United Breweries stock rose 154.74% in one year after it was split in June 2006. Similarly, Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services and Asian Paints shares, split in 2013, rose 20.9% and 14.08%, respectively, in the next one year.
In contrast, Jindal Steel & Power, NMDC and National Aluminum Company shares fell 70.30%, 62.76% and 48.61%, respectively, after the split (For details see tables Divide and Rule & Weighed Down).
Vikram Dhawan, director, Equentis Capital, says, "Anecdotal evidence suggests that blue-chip stocks gain more from stock splits than others. Stocks that are under the futures & options category may also benefit from increased retail participation. However, companies with volatile earnings may suffer a rise in volatility in their share prices."
SMC's Aggarwal says, "Stock split does not result in a change in investor wealth. Nor does it affect the company's business model and financial position. Thus, it does not in any way indicate how the company is going to perform in the future. The same thing is reflected in the analysis of BSE 500 stocks. However, it cannot be denied that a company with strong fundamentals will generally give positive returns in the long run after the split."
Should You Invest?
A split creates positive sentiment about the stock. However, that can last only for some time and fundamentals will catch up, sooner or latter. Investors should remain cautious and consider the company's financial performance and
business outlook before investing.
'Stock split does not change investor wealth. Nor does it affect the company's financial position. It does not indicate how the company is going to perform in the future', says DK Aggarwal, chairman and MD, SMC Investments and Advisors
While increase in liquidity after the split has some benefits, it cannot be the sole factor for investing. "The valuation and trajectory of earning growth will always trump over any other factor, including stock splits," says Dhawan of Equentis Capital. "An investor should not buy a stock only because the company has decided to split it," says Jain of Nirmal Bang Securities.
Split Vs Bonus
In a bonus issue, shareholders get extra shares for free. A company, for instance, may announce a 1:4 bonus issue. This means the shareholder will get one additional share for every four shares that he holds. Thus, the shareholder who had 800 shares will get 200 bonus shares. However, the total market value of the shares do not change. So, if these 800 shares were valued at Rs 10 each (total value Rs 8,000), after the bonus, each share will be valued at Rs 8 (total Rs 1,000). The number of shares rises but market capitalisation and face value remain the same. Unlike in stock split, bonus shares are allotted by capitalising of reserves and surplus. A bonus issue, just like a split, increases the number of shares without impacting the total market capitalisation. A stock split divides each share, lowering both its face value and market price. For example, if a company goes for a 1:2 split, both face and market values of its shares are halved.

Bihar govt warns to put boards of PM Modi to protest fund crunchBy: Press Trust of India | Patna |
Posted: December 2, 2014 3:22 pm
Accusing the Centre of discriminating Bihar in allocation of fund for construction of rural roads, the state government on Tuesday threatened to put up boards of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the proposed roads to highlight that work could not be taken up due to absence of central funds.
“The Rural Works Department will put up boards of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the proposed roads in villages where work could not be taken up due to absence of fund from the Pradhan Mantri Grameen Sadak Yojna (PMGSY),” Rural Works Department Minister Shrawan Kumar said.
The minister said 35,000 km of rural roads would have to be built at an estimated cost of Rs 11,000 crore in the state under PMGSY scheme.
“The state had demanded Rs 4,000 crore in the 2014-15 fiscal, but got an assurance of only for Rs 2042 crore. Even this amount has been further lowered to Rs 1650 crore,” the state minister said.
While money for Bihar was being slashed, it had been increased for BJP-ruled states like Gujarat and Chhattisgarh, he alleged.
Against Rs 345 crore initially earmarked for Gujarat under PMGSY, the Centre has sanctioned Rs 400 crore.
Likewise for Chhattisgarh, the amount has been scaled up to Rs 277 crore against Rs 227 crore initially earmarked, he claimed.
Kumar, a close confidante of former Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, said if the Centre did not provide required fund to the state under PMGSY by December end, the department would start installing boards in the name of the Prime Minister from January next year on roads where work have been hampered due to absence of funds.
He said he would make a request during the coming winter session of state Assembly to allow the department special fund for hanging boards with Prime Minister’s name on such roads.
Kumar, who hails from home district of Nalanda of Nitish Kumar, made a scathing attack on the union ministers hailing from the state saying, “While they do not miss any chance to cast aspersions on Nitish Kumar without any facts, they do not open their mouth in front of Narendra Modi for release of fund for carrying development works in Bihar.”

MU/DAI brings a dose of real-world thinking to innovation0
A. We have technology startups to Fortune 100 chief innovation officers looking for fresh ideas. A recent project we completed was for XCOR Aerospace in conjunction with Paramount Pictures and the release of their movie “Interstellar” to give contestants a chance to win a free trip to space. The winner is yet to be announced. (XCOR is a spacecraft company that has created a model for suborbital space travel.)
Q. What did you do with XCOR?
A. We're helping them design the digital experience and branding. Obviously space is space, but how do you enhance that?
Q. Your new office will have a lab for such things?
A. The lab has a live-feed observatory and interview room designed like a living room with multiple cameras throughout with audio feeds. We have a high-end retail lab that allows customers to come in and see how a store may look and be redesigned for the customer experience and a tech lab which has every new wearable, every new tracking device, mobile tablet, computer, Oculus, and all the gadgets that our clients, partners or our team can tinker with.
Q. How do you help clients do practical innovation?
A. We get that your CEO put out your big audacious goal for 2018. But you’re not going to jump from where you’re at today with your systems being where they are.
It’s pushing them forward and showing viability of an idea and that it’s in this marketplace already. That’s the key. You have to show that the innovation exists in some form, whether in another industry or some technology coming about, and then people are willing to act.
Q. What innovation lesson from the past shaped how you work today?
A. I used to be the guy who would make everything overly complex because I couldn’t leave out a feature. When I started getting into fail-fast mode, I realized that offering too many choices leads to confusion. If you keep it simple, you can innovate just ahead of the game, where you don’t have to be 10 years down the road.

Xiaomi Redmi Note  resale  starts within minutes after it goes out of stockWritten by Debashis Sarkar | New Delhi |
Posted: December 2, 2014 5:08 pm | Updated: December 3, 2014 10:57 am
The newly launched Redmi Note smartphone from Xiaomi went out of stocks in six seconds on Flipkart today. Xiaomi sold 50,000 units at a price of Rs 8,999. However, what is more interesting is people who managed to get one on their carts were quick to post resale offers on social media and Ebay.
Many Flipkart users who managed to book the Redmi Note were offering it at an average price of Rs 9,500. The Redmi Note is selling at a price as high as Rs 15,000 on Ebay.in. Before the flash sales, several buyers were even offering a booking service on Flipkart for Rs 500.
From guaranteeing the booking to offering free home delivery, disappointed buyers who couldn’t book one themselves have several options to buy the Redmi Note today by paying extra.
It seems Xiaomi has enabled a new breed of business in which people can earn some pocket money by simply taking advantage of the huge demand compared to the supply. However, it has been reported that Xiaomi as well Flipkart are taking this black marketing seriously and is looking to check it based on user behaviour that resembles resellers. It would be interesting to know how many of the buyers during any Xiaomi sale are genuine buyers and not people trying to make a quick buck.
The phone is powered by an octa-core MTK 6592 1.7GHz processor from MediaTek. It has a 5.5-inch 720p display that will draw power from a 3,100 mAh lithium-polymer battery. The Redmi Note mounts a 13MP rear camera and a 5MP front facing camera for sefie-holics.
The Xiaomi Redmi Note has an eye-popping spec sheet at a jaw-dropping price. However, before you line up virtually on Flipkart, note that this is a really large device and one that runs on the now dated Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean operating system. Read the full review here.
Are you willing to spend extra money to buy the Xiaomi Redmi Note? Share your views in the comment section below.

Calorie Counts On Fast Food Menus Won t Make People Eat LessPutting Calorie Counts On Fast Food Menus Won't Make People Eat Less, Experts Say
Posted:
reddit
Americans will soon know just how many calories are in that fast food burger they're about to buy. But that won't necessarily make them think twice about buying it.
The Food and Drug Administration last week announced new rules requiring fast food chains, vending machine companies and other restaurants with more than 20 locations to list the number of calories in each of their menu items. The regulations, which came out of a provision of Obamacare, aim to help diners make “informed choices for themselves and their families,”  FDA Commissioner Margaret A. Hamburg wrote in a press release.
But extra information may not translate into healthier choices, experts say. With a few exceptions , “the overwhelming majority of the research” finds that diners don’t eat less when restaurants post the number of calories in their meals, according to David Just, a Cornell professor who has researched how portion labeling influences food choice .
People who make dining decisions based on calorie counts already have a pretty good sense of how many calories are in a Big Mac or burrito, Just noted. And most diners who head to a restaurant chain go for a specific item and rarely look at the menu anyway, said Maeve Webster, a senior director at DataSsential, a company that studies food trends. If customers don't look at the menu, they won't see how many calories are in that serving of french fries.
"It will be a very rare case where a restaurant will full-on lose customers by putting calorie counts up there,” Webster said.
This July 18, 2008, file photo shows a McDonald's drive-thru menu in New York, printed with calorie counts for each food item.
Probably the biggest reason why adding calorie counts doesn't typically change diners' behavior is that many people “have virtually no understanding” of how many calories they should be eating or even what constitutes a healthy meal, Webster said. For some, calorie counts are just “white noise” on an already crowded menu , she said.
In some cases, listing the calories on the menu may even trick diners into thinking that unhealthy items are normal, Webster said. For example, if people see a 2,000-calorie burger at a variety of different restaurants, they could begin to think that a burger should have 2,000 calories. For some perspective, an average quarter-pound cheeseburger with ketchup on a bun has about 400 calories, according to FitDay , an online dietary and weight loss journal.
The FDA rules do offer some help for diners trying to make sense of calorie counts, by requiring that eateries post a statement that says: “2,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice, but calorie needs vary.”
Posting calorie counts may even push some people to eat more food rather than less, Webster suggested. Some people might think that higher calorie counts mean they're getting more for their money, just as they do with bigger portion sizes.
A 2012 study on the impacts of New York City’s 2008 requirement to post calorie counts found that McDonald’s customers slightly increased their calorie intake after the rules took effect.
It’s also not uncommon for restaurants to add a super-high-calorie item to the menu to make a slightly less-heavy meal look healthier to customers, Just said. He added that he wouldn’t be surprised to see restaurants try this tactic as the calorie count rules go into place.
Some research does show that restaurants make their dishes healthier in response to requirements to post calories. And most of the research on the impacts of calorie counts has focused on short-term results and fast food chains, according to Brian Elbel, a professor at NYU's Wagner School of Public Service who studies how people make decisions that influence their health. We still don't really know much about what the long-term effects of the policy might be, or how the rules might affect fancier establishments, he said.
Elbel’s own research on the topic has found that fast food diners take note of calorie information when restaurants post it, but don't change the number of calories they eat or the number of times they visit the restaurants.
But research focused on fast food may not be a reliable predictor of how calorie counts affect behavior in other contexts, Elbel said. That’s because people typically don’t head to fast food restaurants with the intention of ordering something healthy. They're looking for something that’s cheap and quick.
Health may be more of a priority when ordering at sit-down chains, which are included in the FDA’s rules , Elbel said. There, seeing the calorie difference between a steak and fish dish could influence a diner’s order, especially given that meals at sit-down chains probably have more calories than most diners think.
“They might have a lot more sticker shock from these places,” Elbel said.

Bill To Ban NYC Horse Carriages Heads To CouncilNew York City Council To Vote On Horse Carriage Ban
 |  By                                                                      JONATHAN LEMIRE and VERENA DOBNIK

NEW YORK (AP) — Mayor Bill de Blasio's long-delayed plans to ban the city's horse carriages are finally moving forward with a bill that phases out the industry by 2016 and dangles a carrot for the soon-to-be unemployed drivers: a career driving a taxi.
That measure was set to be introduced at a City Council meeting next week but it already drew fierce opposition from the 400 drivers and stable hands who say it was an insult to suggest they could be satisfied with another way of life.
"We want to stay in business, and the horse is our business, " said Christina Hansen, a carriage horse driver who claimed de Blasio is ill-informed on the issue. "The mayor still hasn't been to the stables."
During his bid for mayor a year ago, Bill de Blasio repeatedly told supporters that "on Day One" he would end what he saw as the inhumane practice of the colorful coaches clip-clopping their way through Central Park and the surrounding streets.
City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito confirmed that the bill currently being drafted with the mayor's support would likely be voted on early next year, and de Blasio said he would not be in favor of further delays.
"We think it's time to end horse carriages in this city and it's time to act on it," he said.
Under the bill, the industry would be phased out by the middle of 2016, with exceptions made for film sets and some parades. The bill would offer job training classes and the waiver of nearly all the fees associated with the license to drive a green taxi, which predominantly pick up passengers outside the heart of Manhattan.
"We're in the tourist field, not the taxi cab business. We don't want to be in the taxi cab business," said driver Stephen Malone, noting that the holiday season was the absolute worst time to push this legislation.
Allie Friedman, head of the group leading the charge to ban the practice, NYCLASS, cheered the news, saying it was "the right creative solution that benefits all New Yorkers by adding jobs while also ending an unsafe and inhumane industry."
That sharp back-and-forth was emblematic of a months-long debate that grew increasingly heated and occupied a bigger and bigger portion of the city's headlines, much to de Blasio's exasperation. The mayor — and the animal welfare activists who donated $1.3 million to his campaign — said the ban should be enacted because the streets of the nation's largest city are no places for horses.
A groundswell of support emerged to save the horses. Actor Liam Neeson led a media blitz that portrayed the industry as an iconic, romantic part of New York that supported many Irish immigrants. A series of city unions — who usually are de Blasio's staunch allies — broke with the mayor, urging him to reconsider his decision in order to save not only the industry's jobs but a profitable source of tourism.
A recent poll revealed that nearly two-thirds of New Yorkers were in favor of keeping the horses at least in Central Park. And The New York Daily News launched a front-page campaign called "Save our Horses" that filled its pages with pro-carriage stories and an online petition that recorded tens of thousands of signatures.

Salman Khan to promote his film in Shah Rukh Khan styleBy: Express News Service | New Delhi |
Posted: December 2, 2014 7:03 pm
The age old hatchet between the two biggies of the industry Salman Khan and Shah rukh Khan has finally been buried. With this, we see the new B-Town bonding getting stronger to the extent that Salman has now decided to promote his upcoming film ‘Prem Ratan Dhan Payo’ like SRK does it for his movies.
Recently SRK was seen promoting his movie ‘Happy New Year’ globally with SLAM! The Tour and something similar is going on in Salman’s mind. Now the superstar also wants to involve global audience in his promotion strategy. For this, he, reportedly, will fly to various countries and promote PRDP. We must say that Salman is really benefiting from this new friendship and it would be an icing on the cake if the movie is a hit world wide.
Though, the ‘Dabangg’ actor has a good fan following in India, but we feel that he would break all records if he earns fans in the outside countries as well.
Salman has re- united with Rajshri after a long gap of 14 years for this film. The movie also stars Sonam Kapoor opposite Salman and is being directed by Suraj Barjatya. Also, we will get to see Neil Nitin Mukesh and Swara Bhaskar in supporting roles.
Releasing next year, this is definitely one of the most awaited films of the year.

Even the assistant she had hired just weeks earlier wouldn't utter a word.
"I went home in tears. My boss wouldn't talk to me. No one would talk to me. It was as if I wasn't there," Negro said. Finally, someone explained that the boss had told everyone to ignore her. “If we [speak to you], we'll lose our jobs," Negro recalled her colleague saying.
It was the mid-1990s and Negro had been working at a research company in Paris for about six months when the silent treatment began. All told, it lasted about three months, despite her efforts to talk things out with her supervisor. "It was just awful. I finally blew up and quit," said Negro, who now lives in Toulouse.
Was she the victim of a bully boss, or simply someone who exerted extreme control? In many instances, bullying and bad behaviour in the workplace is all about control.
Experts on controlling relationships say moving on, as Negro did, is often the best and only successful tactic for ending the harsh treatment — at work and in personal relationships. That’s in large part because control-prone people likely won't change. But if you must stay because you need the salary or for other reasons, you'll need strategies for dealing with controlling people.
It starts with understanding the motivation for the behaviour, holding your ground and managing the problem with minimal involvement. Here’s how to identify a controller’s purposes, take charge and keep your sanity:
The DNA of a controller
Controlling behaviour from a colleague or boss has various origins — some you might not have considered. Perhaps your colleague is afraid of losing his position, or perhaps he is hiding his own incompetence, insecurities or fears.
“Many times controllers have been passed over for a promotion,” said Jim Warner, author of The Drama-Free Office: A Guide to Healthy Collaboration with Your Team, Coworkers, and Boss. “Then the bitterness leaks out on their colleagues and they try to manage their peers. The controller will second-guess or behave as a perfectionist."
Lesley Stephenson, an expert on anger management based in Zurich, Switzerland, said people may have good intentions, even if their behaviour is destructive. "Understand that the other person may care too much," she said. "Or perhaps the controller may not trust the delegation process." 
Whatever the reason, controlling attitudes can make the workplace a minefield, leaving victims unsure where they stand, explained Warner, who is based in Boulder, Colorado, in the US.
"I thought I had done something wrong, but I couldn't pinpoint it,” said Negro, who never learned why her boss controlled colleagues so tightly. “Getting treated this way makes you put yourself in question."
Strategy 1: Dissect and understand
California-based Patricia Evans, author of Controlling People: How to Recognize, Understand and Deal with People Who Try to Control You, said it is crucial to listen for ways a controlling person tries to enter your mind and dictate your reality.
At work, it may come up when the controller says, "Let me do it. We know you're not good with numbers."
Note the emphasis is on "we". Someone who uses "we" in this way claims to know the other person's perception of his own abilities — or the entire group’s perception of the person, Evans noted in her book.
Other examples: "I know why you raised that question in the meeting. You're trying to [fill in the blank]: ... claim territory as your own, bring attention to your idea, look good in front of the boss."
This is another example of how the controller claims to know the inner motivations of another person. "If someone defines you, even in subtle ways, they are pretending to know the unknowable,” Evans said. "You can become exhausted trying to explain, 'That's not what I want, think, am trying to do' and so forth. The constant stress can lead to physical illness, sleep problems, confusion and depression."
Another big sign that a person is trying to control is the question "why”, said Warner.
"A 3-year-old genuinely wants to know why the sky is blue,” Warner said. "But almost all 'why' questions in the workplace are a statement shrouded as a question. Never answer a why question."
Here’s how it works in practice.
Controlling colleague: "I saw your papers on the copy machine. Why are you working on that project?"
Possible translation: "You shouldn't be working on that project."
"Simply reflect back," advised Warner. Don’t get defensive or try to rationalise with emotion.
A good response might be: "Sounds like you found my papers on the copy machine. It looks like you're interested in my projects. Thanks for that." Then walk away, recommends Warner.
Another option is engaging someone about his behaviour: "John, it sounds like there's something else coming up for you with this project."
Be careful with this option, however. An engaging response can still escalate controlling behaviour. The controller might say: "I asked you a question. Why are you working on that project?" Warner's proposed answer, "John, what is it that you really want?"
Strategy 2: Say stop, mean stop
Often controlling behaviour is enforced with belittling or anger. Sometimes this occurs in private so the controller can keep the other person from having "evidence" of the hurtful behaviour. Negro says her boss in Paris would explode, but only behind closed doors. In the open, he used strategies such as silent treatment.
As difficult as it might sound, you must attempt to stick up for yourself, experts say.
"Sometimes people don't want to speak out because they feel their job is in jeopardy,” said Stephenson. "My experience is that once the person does speak up, they find 10 other people who feel the same way."
Speaking up might mean taking a firm and direct approach with the controlling person, even if this doesn't suit your style. You've got to push back strongly. Warner said, "If you have a weak boundary, [controllers] steamroll over it."
Strategy 3: Manage and minimise
You can minimise the behaviour by refusing to engage with a controller on her terms, by managing her behaviour through careful dialogue or reducing interactions.
That’s important because if you stay in such an environment for too long, "it has pathological negative consequences, meaning you'll get sick or it will impact the other relationships in your life,” Warner said.
In the end, if you have lived at odds with a controlling person for a long time, the best resolution may be to focus on letting go — or what in another setting may be called forgiveness. 
"I can cling to it and suffer, or I can let it go," said Warner. "Accept what happened. Take a deep cleansing breath. Look in the windshield instead of the rear-view mirror."

Amazon robots speed customer orders but may lead to fewer workersAmazon robots speed customer orders but may lead to fewer workers
Amazon uses cute robots to get products sold and shipped faster
We all know retail stores hire extra help around the busy holiday season. Amazon has turned to technology to handle this year's craze.
We all know retail stores hire extra help around the busy holiday season. Amazon has turned to technology to handle this year's craze.
Cyber Monday
This holiday season, Amazon's little helper is an orange, 320-pound robot called Kiva.
The robots — more than 15,000 of them companywide — are part of Amazon's high-tech strategy to get orders to customers faster. By lifting shelves of Amazon products off the ground and automatically delivering them to employee stations, the robots cut the time it takes for warehouse workers to walk around looking for items.
But a growing army of robots at the country's biggest e-commerce retailer could spell trouble down the line for many of the thousands of employees at Amazon's 109 warehouses. Amazon's moves to revolutionize operations could also have implications industrywide if smaller companies feel forced to similarly adapt to compete.

"Real-life workers are going to have less to do," said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. "It's obvious that humans are going to lose these jobs. There will be exactly the same impact on retail as robots have had on manufacturing."
During a tour of Amazon's year-old fulfillment center here Sunday — the first time media were allowed to get a close-up look at the Kiva robots and Amazon's latest warehouse model — the company sought to dispel worries about the rise in automation.
"We continue to add employees, and no employee has been negatively impacted by Kiva coming on board," said Dave Clark, Amazon's senior vice president of worldwide operations and customer service. He noted that Amazon hired 80,000 seasonal workers for the holidays, up 14% from a year earlier.
The Tracy warehouse, about an hour east of Oakland, was pulsing with activity on the eve of Cyber Monday as humans and machines worked side by side to prepare for one of the biggest shopping days of the year.

Kiva robots zoomed around four floors with uncanny precision, hoisting shelves laden with video games, coloring books and stuffed animals. Yellow bins filled with completed orders zipped by on conveyor belts. A group of employees, some sporting red Santa hats, took a break from sealing boxes to do a series of arm stretches.
Since acquiring robot-maker Kiva, a Massachusetts company, for $775 million in cash in 2012, Amazon has been increasingly implementing automation at its gargantuan fulfillment centers. Kivas, which resemble overgrown Roombas, are capable of lifting as much as 750 pounds and silently glide across Amazon's warehouse floors by following rows of sensors.
The Tracy facility has the company's latest "eighth-generation" fulfillment center technology, including 3,000 Kivas. Ten Amazon warehouses, including two in California, are classified as eighth-generation.
Real-life workers are going to have less to do. It's obvious that humans are going to lose these jobs. - Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities
Clark said that because Kiva-equipped facilities eliminate the need for wide aisles for humans to walk down, eighth-generation centers can hold 50% more inventory than older warehouses. More storage capacity means a wider selection of merchandise, fewer chances of products being out of stock and more possibilities for same-day delivery, he said.
"It's sort of a virtuous cycle," he said. The robots, he added, have also cut processing times for orders to as little as 13 minutes from well over an hour.
He said increased automation hasn't led to reduced staffing levels at newer warehouses because the company continues to grow rapidly, which has led to more hiring.
"When you look around at Kiva, there's still a lot of people working," Clark said. "What we've done is automate the walking element. Our focus on automation is to do automation that helps employees do their job in an easier way, in a more efficient manner."
I wonder if the robots are demanding $15/hr?

That may be true for now, but Amazon's robots are already doing tasks humans would otherwise do, which over time will "almost assuredly" lead to fewer lower-wage workers, said Harley Shaiken, a professor and labor expert at UC Berkeley.
"The notion of robots is meant to replace workers; it's meant to lower labor costs," he said. "Just saying no one has ever been negatively affected doesn't tell us much about what the future looks like."
Since at least the early 1970s, labor productivity and employment in the U.S. have risen practically in tandem. That changed in the early 2000s, when productivity began to outpace employment, so far at an ever-widening rate.
Although Amazon maintains that it is still actively hiring in droves, it's an open question whether the rapid hiring due to fast growth makes up for jobs lost as work is automated. Few economists, however, dispute the idea that automation increasingly makes low-skill human labor unnecessary. It's not just an Amazon issue — it's a problem that affects the entire economy.
But there are upsides. For shoppers, the cost savings and greater efficiency will mean continued low prices for Amazon goods, delivered at even faster speeds.
Because robots can't replicate everything humans do, such as being able to identify the exact product a customer has ordered and check it for quality, hordes of employees will still be needed. Those jobs will tend to be higher-paid ones: While robots handle the more menial, labor-intensive tasks, skilled workers will be needed to operate, maintain and program the fleet of state-of-the-art machines.
About 4,000 employees work out of the Tracy facility, 2,500 of them hired for the holiday season rush. Amazon has projected sales during the fourth quarter to increase 7% to 18% compared with the same quarter last year.
The warehouse, which is more than 1 million square feet in size, is still not at full capacity. It houses 21.5 million items (3.5 million unique SKUs), with plans by Amazon to increase that number to up to 27 million items next year. On a peak day — such as Cyber Monday — the fulfillment center ships 700,000 products.
Workers at the facility said they enjoyed the ease of Kiva robots bringing products directly to them, though some conceded they missed navigating the former maze of aisles to find products.
Clark declined to discuss the cost of each robot, or how much Amazon spent building the Tracy warehouse. But, he noted, "we're very happy with the economics."
Seattle-based Amazon is still in the early stages of warehouse automation and has been rolling out several tech upgrades. Some facilities use Robo-Stow, a six-ton robot that moves merchandise pallets as high as 24 feet onto Kiva robots, and "vision systems" that can confirm each item in an entire trailer of inventory in as little as 30 minutes by capturing an image of the trailer's contents.

8 traits your new hire should have8 traits your new hire should have
What traits should new hires have?

What's one underappreciated trait you look for in all new hires?
Question: What's one underappreciated trait you look for in all new hires?
8
Communication
“We look for candidates who over-communicate: they reconfirm times and locations for interviews a day in advance, they email thank-you notes after screening calls, and they follow up if they don't hear anything. We know this trait will help ensure that they won't have a miscommunication at work and that very little will slip past them.”
Bhavin Parikh, Magoosh Inc
0
“I always ask new hires what they do in their spare time, and I place value on hobbies and activities that require an active mind and serious ambition. If team members shows passion off the clock, then this will inevitably translate into their ability to be passionate about their work.”
Robert J. Moore, RJMetrics
Involvement
“I've personally found that people involved as leaders in clubs, student government or other organizations on campus (unpaid, but very active) are some of the best people who go above and beyond at work. I always look for those activities on résumés, and I try to understand their real involvement. For me, finding active students translates into active employees.”
Eric Koester, DCI
Entrepreneurship
“Because my company is small, each person is treated as an entrepreneur in charge of her own domain. Too many companies shy away from entrepreneurial employees, but I embrace them. Everyone I hire has the curious, can-do attitude of an entrepreneur.”
Laura Roeder, MeetEdgar.com
Hustle
“Having employees who are hustlers is essential. Not just in what they do — whether it's sales, technical, marketing or anything else. You can teach processes, but you can't teach someone how to hustle. Having an innate personality of being a hustler means he will do everything he can to help propel the business forward.”
Bryan Silverman, InStall Media
Happiness
“We're looking for well-balanced, mentally healthy employees who have found a sense of happiness in their lives. Happy employees serve our clients brilliantly, work through conflict respectfully and don't infuse unnecessary drama into the business.”
Corey Blake, Round Table Companies
Curiosity
“Technology moves quickly. To stay up to date, a strong sense of curiosity is needed. I like to hear about the new tech people are using and their opinions on using it. A good developer is not a stagnant one. He knows what's happening on the bleeding edge, as well as what is stable enough to be used for mission critical applications.”
Peter Baumgartner, Lincoln Loop
Time management
“When we conduct our interview process, we look for people who are really organized and great at managing time. If we feel they are not, then we know they will never be able to finish a project on time, and that may not be good for the team or for your business. The last thing you want is a team member who procrastinates and makes other team members look bad because of his or her time management.”
Derek Capo, Next Step China

ViaForensics raises $12.5 million in funding  rebrands as NowSecure0
“The old name was not reflective of what we do as a company, which is mobile security,” Hoog said.
The company offers software products to combat data theft and security vulnerability, with the bulk of its business coming from large financial, healthcare and government organizations. The products range from testing apps for security weakness to identifying risk on mobile devices.
NowSecure also offers a free app, NowSecure Mobile, to help individuals assess security of their phones. The app, under its previous name, viaProtect, has been downloaded more than 120,000 times in nearly 190 countries, Hoog said.
As more companies are implementing “Bring Your Own Device” policies for employees, Hoog sees security as a growing concern. The company estimates that 40 percent of organizations will be “exclusively BYOD” by 2016.
“The trend is overwhelmingly empowering the individual to secure their devices — it’s a win for the individual and a win for the enterprise,” he says.  
The company will use the funds to invest in engineering, sales and marketing, Hoog said. NowSecure has about 50 employees — half work in their Oak Park headquarters, the others remotely across the U.S., Europe and South America. He expects the team to grow “significantly” over the next 12 to 18 months.
“We have a tremendous opportunity in front of us,” Hoog said. “Mobile is so large — security and privacy have become such big issues. We were extremely well-positioned to scale our business, but you need capital to do that.”
Jump Capital and Math Venture Partners participated in the funding round.

Before You Give  Check out a Charity s RatingsBefore you give, check out a charity's ratings
Sharon Epperson CNBC

During the holiday season, many of us are flooded with phone calls and letters requesting contributions to various charitable organizations—and we respond. About 95 percent of households donate to charities, averaging about $3,000 per household contribution, according to the  National Philanthropic Trust .
Charitable giving is one of the top financial priorities of many individuals and families, along with saving for retirement and college.
"We hear very consistently that it's an important element of their financial planning," said Fidelity Investments' Kathleen Murphy, who oversees $1.7 trillion in assets as president of the firm's personal investing business. "Almost regardless of the affluence they have, people want to give back."
But when people give, they should be certain that the charity isn't a scam and that the contribution—big or small—will have the greatest impact. Here's a checklist to make sure you're choosing a charity wisely.
1. Find a charity whose mission you believe in. 
If it's a local nonprofit or a national organization with programs in your community, you can volunteer your time or go in person to see some of the programming in action. Check out the company's website as well as independent reviews and evaluations.
2. Make sure it's a legitimate, reputable charity.
Verify that it is a tax-exempt organization registered with the Internal Revenue Service by reviewing its  Form 990 .
3. Determine how your donation will be used.
GuideStar ,  CharityNavigator ,and  CharityWatch are a few websites that will give you an overview of an organization's financial health and budget breakdown.
4. The typical charity spends 75 percent of its budget on programs, according to CharityNavigator.Look for nonprofits that hit or come close to the benchmark.
The rest of a typical charity's budget goes to administrative costs (15 percent) and fundraising (10 percent).
CharityWatch delves a bit deeper into an organization's fundraising and other accounting practices, including how much is spent to raise each $100 of funds that are collected.
5. Also, be sure to assess the impact of the charity's work. 
GiveWell does in-depth research on programs that it determines have had the most impact on people's lives and then suggests a handful of charities it deems best at delivering these programs. It also suggests questions that you should ask a charity to evaluate whether the organization is actually "doing good" and having a measurable effect.
6. If you don't have time to do the research and can't decide which charity to choose, you can still make a tax-deductible charitable contribution to a donor-advised fund. It's like a charitable savings account.
You can contribute to the fund as often as you'd like and recommend grants to your favorite charity when you're ready. A number of investment firms, including Vanguard,  Charles Schwab and  Fidelity , offer donor-advised funds.

CSN and Dish avoid blackout with short-term extension1
At stake is CSN Chicago's slate of Bulls, Blackhawks, White Sox and Cubs games and its other sports programming, a local fan staple for 10 years. Dish has more than 342,000 subscribers in the Chicago area who would be affected by such a blackout, according to media research firm SNL Kagan.
CSN started an on-air campaign last week warning viewers of the looming blackout and trying to enlist their support in negotiations with Dish. On Monday, CSN said it had received "hundreds of thousands" of calls, emails, tweets, website visits and petitions in support of its programming.
Launched in 2004, CSN Chicago is a partnership among Comcast and the Bulls, Blackhawks, White Sox and Cubs. Comcast owns about 30 percent of the sports network and the teams control the rest. CSN Chicago has never been blacked out by a cable satellite provider.
Dish is the third-largest pay-TV provider in the U.S. behind Comcast and DirecTV. The satellite provider is engaged in similar carriage fee disputes with Turner Broadcasting and CBS, and recently reached short-term agreements with both to continue airing their programming while negotiations continue.
Positioned as a value-priced service, Dish has shown a willingness to hold the line on cable network license fees, especially when dealing with regional sports networks. In August, Dish dropped CSN New England after a series of extensions failed to resolve a carriage dispute.
As the Dish dispute with CSN Chicago took a promising turn, negotiations with CBS apparently reached an impasse. CBS issued a statement Tuesday saying that after six months of "vigorously attempting to secure fair carriage deals," there would be no more extensions, and warning that without an agreement, the network would go dark on Dish at 6 p.m. CT Thursday.
"In the last few weeks, we have granted two extensions, in the hopes that this would give both parties sufficient time to come to a resolution," the CBS statement said. "The second extension, which protected Dish subscribers' programming over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, was the final one."
A Dish spokesman did not comment on Tuesday's ultimatum, reiterating a previous statement that said "only CBS can force a blackout of its channels," and "there is time for the two parties to reach a mutually beneficial deal."

Walgreen index identifies states with largest number of flu casesWalgreen index identifies states with largest number of flu cases
By Ellen Jean Hirst, @ellenjeanhirst
Walgreens
A weekly flu index launched Tuesday by drugstore giant Walgreen Co. will rank states and market areas based on the number of flu cases.
Illinois ranked No. 7 during the week of Thanksgiving, and Chicago was No. 16 among the top 100 market areas. The index is based on the number of antiviral prescriptions filled at Walgreens stores to treat the flu. It will provide information on the largest weekly increases in flu cases, as well as the largest number of cases for any given week.
Deerfield-based Walgreen is the largest drugstore chain in the U.S. with more than 8,200 locations, including 502 in the Chicago area.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also provides weekly flu data on its website. In its report for the week ending Nov. 21, the CDC classified flu activity in Illinois as minimal.
Walgreen surveyed 8,100 stores for state data and 7,200 nationwide for market-area data. Seven states were not included in the data, because they did not have markets with at least 20 Walgreens locations.
“This weekly report can help alert health officials and the public in areas where flu activity is trending the most,” said Richard Ashworth, Walgreens president of retail and pharmacy operations. “With the ability to generate hyperlocal data that’s as specific as a single ZIP code, the Walgreens Flu Index can become a platform to improve preventive health measures throughout the season, including immunization rates.”

SpiceJet Cancellations Trigger Chaos At Airports
Mumbai: Naresh Goyal-promoted Jet Airways on Tuesday began to formally discontinue its low-cost arm JetLite by rolling out full service products on all flights across its domestic network.
"Starting today, Jet Airways will offer a two-class, full service product with a complimentary dining experience onboard all domestic flights," it said in a statement.
The move is a part of a board-approved business plan announced in August to help the airline return to profitability.
The airline further said following this, it will offer connectivity on its all 51 domestic destinations with over 450 daily flights, apart from accessing its 22 international destinations and 135 destinations of its international equity partner Etihad Airways, which owns a 24 per cent stake in the carrier.    
Group chief executive Cramer Ball said the move to a full service brand shows the airline's commitment to continually enhance the service and hospitality.

Solid construction  auto sales data boost U.S. growth pictureU.S. housing starts fall, but trend points to recovery
By Lucia Mutikani, Reuters
Land Price
U.S. housing starts fell in November as groundbreaking for single-family homes declined after two hefty increases, in what appeared to be a brief pause in a gradual recovery trend.
Starts dropped 1.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.028 million units, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. October's starts were revised up to a 1.045 million-unit pace.

Despite November's fall, groundbreaking is up 7.7 percent compared to the first 11 months of 2013. Starts have averaged a 990,000-unit pace so far this year, up from an average 930,000-unit rate last year.
"It is hard to complain about the housing sector," said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland Pennsylvania. "The U.S. economy is on an accelerating growth path that should continue for quite some time. We don't need a robust housing market to drive growth."
Wall Street had forecast starts rising at a pace of 1.04 million units from October's previously reported pace of 1.01 million units.

In a separate report, financial data firm Markit said its preliminary or "flash" U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index fell to 53.7 in December, the lowest reading in 11 months, from 54.8 in November.
While the survey hints at slowing factory activity, so-called hard data such as industrial production have painted a bullish picture of the manufacturing sector and showed little sign that a sputtering global economy and crude oil price rout were having an impact on American factories.
U.S. stocks were up sharply in volatile trading and prices for U.S. Treasury debt rose. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies.    Housing is being stymied by tepid wage growth, which has been far outpaced by home price increases. Higher mortgage rates are also a constraint, although they have declined from a peak reached in September 2013.
A very slow pace of household formation also is a challenge. High unemployment among young adults is forcing many to either continue living at home with their parents or share quarters with friends or relatives.
Household formation is currently running at about 500,000 a year, far below the more than 1 million mark that would signal a robust housing market.
But with job growth accelerating, wages are expected to pick up next year and pull in first-time buyers, especially young people, into the housing market, providing a tailwind for the economy. Housing has been a mild boost to growth so far in 2014.
"We believe that it will be only a matter of time before the housing recovery shifts up a gear or two and provides a crucial second wind to the economic recovery," said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
Single-family homes starts, the largest part of the market, fell 5.4 percent. Groundbreaking in the volatile multi-family homes segment rose 6.7 percent after October's 9.9 percent drop.
Permits for future home construction declined 5.2 percent, the biggest drop since January, to a 1.035 million-unit pace after two straight months of gains.
Permits, which lead starts by three to four months, have been above a 1 million-unit pace since July. Both single-family and multi-family permits fell.

Conservatives Call On Rick Perry To Halt Execution Of Mentally Ill InmateConservatives Call On Rick Perry To Halt Execution Of Scott Panetti
Posted:

Conservatives want Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) to spare the life of Scott Panetti, whose execution is set for Wednesday. (Photo by Erich Schlegel/Getty Images)
WASHINGTON -- A group of conservative leaders is mounting a last-minute effort to stop Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) from executing inmate Scott Panetti, arguing that killing "one of the most seriously mentally ill prisoners on death row in the United States" would "undermine the public's faith in a fair and moral justice system."
Panetti admitted in 1995 to having killed his in-laws three years earlier, while his wife and three-year-old daughter watched. He has suffered from schizophrenia and other mental illnesses for over 30 years and has been hospitalized on 15 separate occasions . In spite of his illness, Panetti is scheduled to be executed on Wednesday at 6 p.m. CST.
Twenty-one conservative leaders have joined with mental health and death penalty reformers in opposing the execution, asking Perry in a recent letter to commute Panetti's sentence to life in prison. Signatories included former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, conservative activist Brent Bozell and former presidential candidate Gary Bauer.
Each of us has been active at the national level of the conservative movement for many years, and no one could accuse us of being soft on crime. Among conservatives there is much debate about the effectiveness and the morality of the death penalty. Some crimes are so terrible, and committed with such clear malice, that some believe that execution seems the only appropriate and proportional response.  But Scott Panetti’s is no such case. [...]
The authority to take a man’s life is the most draconian penalty that we allow our government to exercise. As conservatives, we must be on guard that such an extraordinary government sanction not be used against a person who is mentally incapable of rational thought. It would be immoral for the government to take this man’s life. Should the Board recommend it, we respectfully urge you to reduce Mr. Panetti’s death sentence to life in prison.
According to The Atlantic, Panetti had come to believe he was engaged in a battle with Satan and tried to exorcise his home by burying his furniture in the backyard. At his trial, he dressed as a cowboy and acted as his own attorney. He also tried to subpoena John F. Kennedy and the Pope .
Prosecutors have argued that Panetti is faking his illness .
Panetti's lawyers filed a motion this month asking Perry to stay the execution for 30 days in order for Panetti to receive a new mental health assessment. (He has not had one since 2007.) The lawyers said they would have filed the request earlier, but no one notified them that an execution date had been set. Instead, they had to learn about it from a newspaper article .
Unlike in other states, Perry can't single-handedly reduce Panetti's sentence -- the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles has to first recommend clemency. On Monday, however, the board unanimously voted against delaying Panetti's execution for 180 days and recommending to Perry that his sentence be commuted.
Perry's office did not immediately return a request for comment on whether the governor agreed with the board's decision or on whether he was considering a 30-day stay.
More than 93,000 people have signed an online petition asking Perry to grant Panetti clemency. He also has the support of his ex-wife and former Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas).
Abby Johnson, an anti-abortion activist, wrote in a recent Dallas Morning News op-ed that opposing Panetti's execution is a pro-life position.
"A fundamental tenet of the pro-life ethic is that all life has value and we are called to protect it, especially in its most vulnerable forms. A culture of life recognizes the value of those who are vulnerable and prioritizes safeguarding them," she wrote.
"By setting an execution date for Panetti, Texas is going entirely contrary to what we expect in a society that truly values life," Johnson added. "This proposed execution shows a troubling disregard toward the reality of mental illness and protecting those who suffer from it."
Mother Jones reporter Stephanie Mencimer noted that it's " unusual for conservative Christians to support a clemency petition like Panetti's." In 1998, conservatives tried to get then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush to stop the execution of Karla Faye Tucker, who had converted to Christianity in prison. (Bush went ahead with the execution.)
But this case is different.
"[Panetti's] religious fervor is the product of a brain disorder, and the evangelicals' opposition to his execution is not related to his religious proclamations," wrote Mencimer. "It is more of a reflection of the shift in public attitudes regarding capital punishment that has been driven by the growing number of exonerations of death row inmates, the high number of mentally ill and disabled people sentenced to die, and the inefficient and expensive administration of capital punishment."
Heather Beaudoin, coordinator of Conservatives Concerned About the Death Penalty, told Mencimer that the Panetti case was "the largest outpouring of support on a death penalty case we've seen from evangelicals," and the first time she was aware of Paul personally speaking out against an execution.
If Texas goes ahead with the scheduled execution, Panetti would be the 519th person to die by lethal injection in the state since 1982.

ISIS Leader s Wife DetainedWife Of ISIS Leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Detained In Lebanon
 |  By                                                                      By BASSEM MROUE

BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanese authorities detained a woman and young boy believed to be the wife and son of the reclusive Islamic State group leader, and were questioning the woman and conducting DNA tests on the child, senior Lebanese officials said Tuesday.
If their identities are confirmed, Lebanon may use the pair as bargaining chips to win the release of soldiers and police taken hostage by the extremists in cross-border attacks earlier this year.
The woman, who was identified as an Iraqi, and the child were taken into custody about 10 days ago while carrying fake ID cards, the officials said.
Very little is known about Islamic State group leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's personal life, including how many wives and children he has. Conservative interpretations of Islam allow men to marry up to four wives. The Islamic State group did not immediately comment on the detentions, but the faction's supporters on Twitter and militant websites cast doubt on the reports.
Adding to the confusion, the Lebanese army did not release an official statement regarding the pair.
A Lebanese military official identified the woman as Saja al-Dulaimi who was held by Syrian authorities and freed in a prisoner exchange with the Nusra Front, Syria's al-Qaida-linked branch, earlier this year. The official said the woman "confessed during interrogation" that she was al-Baghdadi's wife.
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.
In March, the Nusra Front freed more than a dozen Greek Orthodox nuns in exchange for the release of dozens of female prisoners by the Syrian government. A woman named Saja al-Dulaimi was reportedly on the list of prisoners freed by Damascus.
A judicial official said the interrogation of the woman was being supervised by Lebanon's military prosecutor, Saqr Saqr, and that a DNA test was underway to confirm that the child is her son. Experts said it would be difficult to confirm whether the woman is indeed al-Baghdadi's wife.
It was unclear what would have brought the woman and child to Lebanon, where IS controls no territory and enjoys only small — although growing — support in some predominantly Sunni Muslim areas.
The detentions added to the mystery that continues to surround al-Baghdadi, who has a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head. He has only made one known public appearance — a sermon he delivered in July at a mosque in Mosul just days after IS declared him the head of an Islamic state, or caliphate, in the territory the group controls in Syria and Iraq.
Last month, Iraqi officials claimed he was wounded in an airstrike. The U.S. has not confirmed those reports, and al-Baghdadi released a new audiotape days after he was purportedly hit.
The Lebanese daily As-Safir first reported the detention of the Islamic State leader's alleged relatives, saying the woman and boy were taken into custody near a border crossing point with Syria. It said the arrest came in "coordination with foreign intelligence agencies."
If the pair's identities are confirmed, the detentions could give Lebanese authorities leverage in their attempts to reach a prisoner-exchange deal with militants from the Islamic State group and the Nusra Front. The extremists have been holding more than 20 Lebanese soldiers and policemen hostage since August, and have demanded the release of Islamist prisoners held by Lebanon. On Monday night, the Nusra Front threatened to kill one of the soldiers it holds captive.
Lebanese troops have clashed repeatedly with militants along the border with Syria since August.
On Tuesday, militants ambushed a Lebanese army patrol near the frontier, killing six soldiers and wounding one, Lebanon's military said. The attack occurred in a remote region of Ras Baalbek in eastern Lebanon and was followed by clashes, the army said in a statement.
It was not immediately clear who was behind the attack, but there was no immediate indication that it was connected to the detention of al-Baghdadi's alleged family members.
Meanwhile, supporters of the Islamic State group released a video claiming responsibility for a shooting that wounded a Danish citizen in the Saudi capital of Riyadh last month.
The video, posted online Monday by the Al-Battar Media Foundation, shows a gunman pulling up beside a vehicle and firing five times at the man inside, identified as Thomas Hoepner. The video's authenticity could not be confirmed but it was posted on a website commonly used by militants.
Saudi security officials say a Danish man was shot while driving Nov. 22, and that he was treated for shoulder wounds. They did not release his name.
If confirmed, the shooting would be the first attack on foreigners in the kingdom carried out by Islamic State supporters. About a decade ago, al-Qaida militants seeking to topple the Western-allied monarchy launched a wave of attacks that killed scores of security forces and Westerners in Saudi Arabia.
The video also includes audio clips of Islamic State group leaders calling on supporters to launch attacks inside the kingdom.
In Brussels, Danish Foreign Minister Martin Lidegaard told reporters Tuesday that "the Dane is doing better."
Denmark and Saudi Arabia are part of the U.S.-led coalition conducting airstrikes against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.

Rajan Hints Governments May Change Duty Import Structure for GoldYou are here: Home Industries
RBI Chief Hints Governments May Change Duty Import Structure for Gold
Press Trust of India | Updated On: December 02, 2014 23:46 (IST)
Mumbai: Hinting that government may change duty structure for gold, Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan on Tuesday said the '80:20' import curb was scrapped to remove distortions it was creating in the precious metal trade.
Mr Rajan also asked investors to put their money in financial instruments and not just in gold.
About the controversial 80:20 gold import curbs, put in place in August 2013 to curb high gold inflows that were widening the current account deficit, Mr Rajan said government decided to scrap this scheme as it was creating distortions.
Under this scheme, at least 20 per cent of the imported gold had to be mandatorily exported before bringing in new lots.
While he did not specify what these distortions were, there have been apprehensions that the controversial 80:20 scheme was leading to increased smuggling of gold and giving undue benefits to select importing entities.
Mr Rajan said the "government decided that it was probably the best decision at this point to scrap this rule", adding there are some requests to change the duty structure and that the government will view and take a decision on it.
The then government in 2013 had increased import duty on gold 10 10 per cent.
"There were arguments that while there were distortions, they were small relative to larger effective containment of gold imports, at the same time there was an argument that any distortion is bad and we are at a point where we can end such distortions," the RBI Governor said.
The surprise move came at a time when the industry was actually expecting more curbs on imports of gold, which is seen as an unproductive asset-attracting household savings away from the financial markets.
"The decision to scrap the 80:20 scheme is a reasonable one and let us see how it plays out. I think the fact that we have a substantial fall in crude imports means that we have some room to sustain an expansion in another import," he said at the post policy meeting with reporters.
The RBI chief said the decision to withdraw the scheme was taken by the government and that the RBI's involvement was just to advise it on the same as there were some debates about the 80:20 scheme and the distortion it was creating.
He asked investors to look at other financial instruments for investments rather than just looking at gold.
"Hopefully, the performance of financial assets, both fixed income and equities, will convince more and more of them to put their money in those kinds of assets in a diversified and safer way rather than in jewellery," Mr Rajan said.
It can be noted that gold imports jumped 280 per cent to $4.17 billion in October. In-bound shipments touched 95 tonnes in September this year as against 12 tonnes a year ago. Following this, there were apprehensions in the market that government and the Reserve Bank may clamp down more restrictions to curb the rising gold imports.
Sources said the 80:20 scheme was initially "working" as gold imports had slowed, but shipments surged after certain relaxations were given by then UPA government in its last day.
The norms were relaxed in May and six private sector trading firms were permitted to import the gold under the scheme. Initially, only state-owned firms and banks were permitted to import. The six private firms, which were given relaxation, accounted for 40 per cent of the total gold imports in the first half.

Ashton Carters long history with military technologyBy Dan Lamothe December 2 Follow @danlamothe
Ashton Carter testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington in February 2013. Carter has emerged as President Barack Obama’s top candidate to become the next defense secretary. (J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press)
The man President Obama is expected to choose to be the next secretary of defense has a long history at the Pentagon, having served in senior positions there for nearly five years. But one of his specialties is particularly timely: Ashton B. Carter is considered one of the country’s top administrators and students of military technology.
Carter, an Oxford and Yale-educated physicist, served as the undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics from April 2009 until October 2011, as the Pentagon ended its eight-year war in Iraq and surged thousands of additional troops into Afghanistan. The job required him to find ways to rush into the field new equipment that was needed by troops and to prepare for emerging national security issues, including cyber warfare and the proliferation of drones.
Carter, speaking in February 2011 at the Cowen Investment Conference in New York, said that while the Pentagon needed to rein in spending after a decade at war, it was in U.S. interests to keep the defense industry strong and encourage small tech companies to compete with corporate giants.
“Smaller firms, start-ups, and new entrants provide needed new technology, new faces, and new ideas to the defense industry,” he said. “The nation’s small businesses add vitality to our base in both prime and subcontractor roles. Mid-sized companies are especially important and worthy of fostering, as they can grow into new sources of innovation and competition.”
According to administration officials, Pentagon official Ashton Carter is expected to be President Obama’s nominee to replace Chuck Hagel as U.S. defense secretary. (Reuters)
One interesting piece to that was shepherding partnerships between industry and the Defense Department. Some of them went through the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, a Pentagon organization that has played a leading role in developing high-tech programs for everything from robotic hand replacements to underwater drones.
Carter ascended to become the deputy defense secretary from October 2011 to December 2013, and continued to highlight the need for new technology in the military. In a speech at the American Enterprise Institute in May 2012 , he highlighted efforts the Pentagon had pursued set up a “fast lane” to get more aerial drones and Aerostat surveillance balloons into Afghanistan.
But Carter added that more needed to be done with technology in the future, even as the Pentagon cut its budget. Obama ordered the Pentagon to make sure it advances in technology where important, Carter said, citing Special Operations, drone operations and cyber warfare as examples.
“He kept saying to us: Make sure that you don’t follow the last-in, first-out rule, that you don’t pull up the things that are most shallowly rooted – namely, your new things – because that’s the easiest thing to do,” Carter said. “I want to see that we are enhancing the capabilities that are going to be part of our future.”
Carter left the Defense Department in December 2013 , after Obama bypassed him to be secretary of defense in favor of Chuck Hagel. He has served as a professor at Harvard University’s Kennedy School for Government and a lecturer and distinguished visiting fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution recently.
Carter joined the Defense Department in the early 1980s, working on missile defense and nuclear weapons. As noted in this 2012 Boston Globe profile , he was probably best known in Washington until recently for having a leading role in the Pentagon’s Cooperative Threat Reduction program, which dismantled 8,000 Soviet nuclear weapons. Obama personally thanked Carter at a 20th anniversary celebration of the arms control effort in 2012.
“I especially want to acknowledge a leader who helped create it and who now helps guide it as our outstanding deputy secretary of defense — Ash Carter. So thank you, Ash, for your great work,” Obama said.

Brave speculators score on energy stocksBrave speculators score on energy stocks

Falling oil prices this year have sent investors running out of energy stocks. But Tuesday, energy stocks were a gusher of gains for speculators.
The average energy stock in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index is up 1.2%, a pleasant reversal of fortunes for energy investors pummeled all year. The average S&P 500 energy stock is down 12% this year, while the S&P 500 itself is up 11%.
Some of the energy stock gains are impressive. Among the energy stocks posting the largest gains include:
BIGGEST GAINS BY S&P 500 ENERGY STOCKS
Company
3.1%
Sources: S&P Capital IQ, USA TODAY research
Even some of the majors are having a good day. Shares of Chevron (CVX) are up 2.4% and Exxon Mobil (XOM) is up 2.2%.
Why are energy stocks bouncing? It’s not oil prices. The price of West Texas Intermediate fell another 1.5% today. The iPath S&P GSCI Crude Oil exchange-trade note, which trades the prices of oil, is down a crushing 30% this year, punishing oil investors.
But what’s working in energy stocks’ favor? Lower prices, says Sam Stovall, strategist at S&P Capital IQ in a note to clients. Over the past 12 months, the S&P Energy Index is 20% below the S&P 500, he says. Energy stocks have traded this poorly just six times since 1990, and in all six times the index posted positive gains in the following 24 months and beat the S&P 500 five of those six instances, Stovall says.
Speculators are betting the pain will soon be their gain. “Domestic and global energy stocks and sectors have taken it on the chin in the past year on worries surrounding global economic growth and oil supply. And while it’s too soon to say that the end of the concern is behind us, (as well as the resulting pressure on oil prices), it may be time to begin thinking about increasing exposure to domestic and global energy sector ETFs, provided you have the patience to wait anywhere from 12 to 24 months,” Stovall says.

Businesses: EPA Clean Power Plan Is Good for Economy  Environmentreddit
If you want to know what American businesses think about the Environmental Protection Agency's new carbon pollution standards and what they'll do to our economy, ask somebody who has built a business.
On Monday, more than 350 entrepreneurs, CEOs, investors and others who belong to Environmental Entrepreneurs (E2) delivered the message loud and clear: Cutting carbon pollution and increasing clean energy through the EPA's Clean Power Plan is good for our economy - and good for our environment. See E2's comments to the EPA here.
These E2 members are on the front lines of entrepreneurship and the American economy. They include the founders and former chairmen of Silicon Valley giants like Google and Sybase; owners of solar companies in Illinois and Iowa; hoteliers in New England and real estate investors in North Carolina.
Collectively, our members have founded or funded more than 1,700 companies that have created 500,000 jobs. Investors in our group manage or help manage more than $100 billion in private and venture capital that will flow into the companies of tomorrow.
Members of other business groups voiced their support for the Clean Power Plan too. More than 220 companies ranging from Nestle to IKEA signed on to comments submitted in support of the plan by the nonprofit business advocacy group CERES.
Of course businesspeople aren't the only ones who support the federal Clean Power Plan, which will cut carbon pollution by 30 percent by 2030 in part by increasing renewable energy and energy efficiency.
In all, more than 8 million comments were delivered to the EPA in support of carbon standards in advance of the Dec. 1 deadline for submissions.
In just one sign of the breadth and broad support for the plan, E2 publicly released our comments along with evangelical Christians who belong to the Evangelical Environmental Network (EEN). See the Deseret News story here and Progress Illinois here for coverage of the press conference we held with my friend Rev. Mitch Hescox, who worked in the coal industry for 14 years before becoming a pastor and president of EEN.
Smart businesspeople know that setting commonsense standards for carbon pollution emissions will send a market signal that America wants clean energy - a signal that will drive job creation and economic growth.
They know we need to cut carbon pollution if we want to have a chance at reducing costly hits to our economy that come with every weather-related disaster and every lost workday due to pollution-related health issues.
And they know that clean energy already works for America, and is already creating jobs in every state in the country. More than 18,000 clean energy jobs were announced in the third quarter of this year alone, according to E2's latest jobs report available at www.cleanenergyworksforus.org. These are good-paying jobs that are making a difference in states and communities across America.
E2 member Emily Rice, an energy efficiency executive in Des Moines, Iowa, describes the Clean Power Plan like this:
"This gives us the best shot at reducing our carbon pollution with smart solutions that directly serve Iowans and our economy."
Business people also know the Clean Power Plan is just the start. We need to make sure the final standards that come out of the plan are as strong as possible, and that the EPA and states implement these standards quickly and in ways that will benefit businesses and consumers the most.
Illinois E2 member Kevin Johnson, a retired U.S. Army captain who now is in the solar business, put it this way:
"The Clean Power Plan provides an opportunity for Illinois to help lead our country to a clean energy future - but the EPA can make the plan better.
"To put us on a path to curbing the most serious effects of climate change while creating jobs and growing our economy, the EPA must implement the strongest plan possible," he says.

How to Create a Culture of Goodreddit
When I was just 6 years old, my life took an unfortunate turn. I remember being in class when I heard the news. My mother had taken her own life.
Having my mother stolen from me at such a young age wasn't fair. To add to my struggle, my Vietnam War veteran father was battling drug and alcohol addictions.
But I didn't go through this heartbreaking time in my life alone. My teacher, Mrs. Overley, was there for me. When I cried in class, she held me. When I went to my mother's funeral, she came for me. Her impact on me during such a difficult time in my young life was undeniable and would ultimately shape my mission in life.
Every one of us has the ability to make a positive impact on a person in need. It's why I firmly believe in creating a culture of good through your personal and professional ventures.
With my wife Katara, I co-founded the Center for Success, an afterschool program for at-risk children. This charitable program provides youth in need with food, mentors, tutoring services and athletic programs. The first Center for Success was in my hometown of Marion, Ind., and has since expanded to Pontiac, Mich. and Zambia, Africa. It's rewarding to make a difference in the lives of these deserving children, just as my elementary school teacher did for me in my time of need.
While I never thought my career path would stray from nonprofit organizations, nearly two years ago, I was presented with an opportunity to join the corporate world and help their employees make a difference. Through the creation and implementation of the Culture of Good corporate social responsibility program, I'm now able to help others make a difference in the lives of thousands of children and people.
The Culture of Good has empowered 1,400 employees in 550 stores to do the most good in their communities. Through our annual backpack giveaway that has donated 160,000 backpacks to kids in need over the past two years to a contest that awarded 300 college scholarships to children, we've truly created a "culture of good" in these communities and among employees.
By identifying what matters most to you, either from a personal experience or a cause that speaks to you, you can create a culture of good in your life. My childhood experiences have helped to shape who I am today, and from those experiences, I've found that giving back to children and leading charitable initiatives really moves me.
For the largely Millennial employee base at my company, working for an organization that shares their values of social responsibility and supporting local initiatives is what drives them to wholeheartedly participate in our Culture of Good movement. In fact, the tremendous sense of fulfillment employees have gained by giving back to their local communities through this program has inspired many to ask how they could become even more involved in the Culture of Good. The program currently has two designated Champions of Good employees in each region, for a total of 300 employees leading the company's charitable initiatives. They foster new ideas, communicate Culture of Good opportunities to fellow employees and ensure philanthropy remains a significant part of our company culture.
Creating a culture of good in your personal and professional life will make a lasting impact on others and yourself. There's no better feeling than to find your calling in life and to be able to share it with others.
I'm happy to say my father has been addiction free since 1983 and that Mrs. Overley, the elementary school teacher who was there for me when I needed someone the most, still keeps in touch to this day. Here's a quote she recently shared with me in a Facebook message:
"Maybe the journey isn't so much about becoming anything. Maybe it's about un-becoming everything that isn't really you so that you can be who you were meant to be in the first place."
If I can offer that understanding to others, then I have accomplished part of my calling in life.

Could This Be the Year Recovery Finally Comes to Main Streetreddit
Might this finally be the year?  This year the National Retail Federation (NRF) is projecting a 4.1 percent increase in holiday retail spending, nearly twice last year's anemic increase of 2.3 percent.  After several years of holiday spending that produced lumps of coal, there is hope that the Christmas shopping season may pivot where Retail goes beyond mere survival and instead finds room to thrive.
Economists point out that The Great Recession actually started in the fall of 2007 and officially ended in the summer of 2009, but the lingering impact of what took place still haunts us today. Scarred by the rise of job losses, personal bankruptcies, and home foreclosures, Americans held on to their purse strings and only barely opened their wallets a crack. That may change this year.
This has been a Swiss Cheese Recovery, thanks in large part to a massive infusion of federal dollars. Thanks to TARP, the Financial Industry found it's footing after staggering through 2007 until one weekend of September 2008, where Washington Mutual and Wachovia failed.  Thanks to reorganization through bankruptcy, GM was able to reemerge as a smaller and leaner behemoth.  The stock market, which took the brunt of the beating, more than recovered and the Dow has set several record highs.
Yet recovery proved elusive on Main Street, especially with holiday retail figures. In a world where personal spending drives 65 percent of economic growth, each successive Black Friday over the past couple of years produced one sour report after another. Even though ecommerce sales rose by double digit increases, consumer confidence remained timid. While some of the basic economic fundamentals improved as we dug out of our financial mess, the numbers for the 2012 holiday retail shopping season barely registered an increase at .7 percent.  Back then, analysts were hoping for a 3 percent increase.
Aside from the stories where a father camps out at a Best Buy for a deal on a large screen television, holiday retail numbers follow the psyche of the American spender.  When the economy fell apart in the fall of 2008, holiday retail spending actually declined by roughly 3 percent, which is catastrophic for retailers who depend on that season to stay alive. Subsequent holiday numbers showed anemic increases but when analysts peered below those figures, it was discovered that these increases came at the cost of substantial product discounting.
So what makes 2014 different? Just as it took time for the economic damage that started in the fall of 2007 to work its way through the economy, it takes just as long (if not longer) for American consumers to embrace that a recovery is real.
5.1 million new jobs had been created since January 2009, but nearly 3.8 million of those new jobs have emerged in the first years of Obama's second term.  It means that the ripple effects of the recovery that slowly began in early 2009 have finally made it out to Main Street.  It means that American shoppers may begin to feel more comfortable about opening their wallets, knowing that their jobs will still be there in January.
However, things won't return to 2005 or 2006. While the news is far better than what was found in years past, the dynamics of shoppers spending has changed.  According to the NRF report American shoppers are still more strategic when it comes to buying what eventually ends up under the tree. They will spend about 6.5 percent more on their own families but they will also begin to purchase gifts for loved ones that have gone giftless during these trying times. Nearly 40 percent of Christmas shoppers will have done some of their holiday gift buying before Halloween arrived on the calendar. What we are seeing is a wiser holiday shopper, one burned by the pain of The Great Recession, but still willing to remember those loved ones with a gift under the tree.
While the initial numbers showed that this year's Black Friday proved a bit quieter than past years, most analysts are confident that the underlying fundamentals are poised for a holiday rebound.  Unlike past years where we all felt like Charley Brown moments after Lucy pulled the football out from under us, this year feels different.
So what am I seeing out there? Like many, I wandered into the maelstrom of Black Friday with my adult daughters and we intuitively noticed that shoppers were more open to spend than in years past.  The aisles and the shopping baskets seem to be far fuller than 2009 or 2010.  The attitudes about spending seem to be a little more relaxed. The pieces seem to be in place for a resplendent recovery.  We may be at a place where the Great Recession can move from the forefront and into our rearview mirrors. It could be the year when Santa adds something extra to the bottom line of retailers everywhere.
We shall see. Don't forget, today is Giving Tuesday.

Where PR Fits in Your Digital Marketing Strategyreddit
Developing a plan for public relations might seem as if it is a daunting undertaking, yet if you do it properly, it may assist in growing your brand, as well as improving profits.
For the majority of organizations, public relations campaigns independently work from marketing ; however if they're integrated, it is going to assist in growing your company even more.
Establish your Goals
Do not start your public relations campaign without having knowledge of what you have a desire to accomplish. This way, you are going to ensure your communications are targeted, that consequently, is going to ensure a better response.
Build up Relationships
The traditional public relations model relied on media like newspapers, television, as well as radio to spread the word and speak with potential customers. Murray Newlands coauthor of How to get PR for your Startup: Traction said "PR should be part of an integrated digital marketing strategy. With 67 percent of the usual B2B purchaser's journey now digitally done, the necessity for high quality integrated public relations is greater than ever."
Putting together a killer media list is going to allow you to target every campaign, and permit you to provide angles which are of interest to each website or publication.
If the media list is sparse, begin to build relationships. Follow niche journalists upon Twitter, as well as locate relevant publications or blogs which match your goals. Relationship building will include the crux of good public relations and will take time, yet it will really be worth it.
Concentrate on Content
Now that you have the distribution list, you just have to send out a press release - right? Erm, actually no.
It is obviously important to get the pitch out there, yet you cannot depend on that alone. You must take an integrated approach, as well as create a plan for public relations which will go above and beyond a press release - share the news on the company blog, upload an image on your Facebook business page, or Tweet about it.
Blending the two is going to spread the word even further - after all, 80 percent of business decision makers like to get company details in a sequence of articles.
Become Newsworthy
You are going to have a larger impact with the pitch if it is newsworthy. Think outside the organization and see what is happening inside your field or the globe in general.
A topical hook will mean the media is more than likely to carry it and also, it is going to have a better resonance with possible customers. High quality content, particularly when it is timely, also is going to begin spreading naturally.
Get Attention
As it will come to emailing the media list, the rules of email marketing are going to apply to public relations, too!
Be certain the subject line is going to stand out, as journalists receive a lot of emails; therefore, the subject line must be enticing.
Keep it brief and to the point.
Involving a video has been proven to boost engagement by 55 percent .
Be Ready
There isn't anything bloggers or journalists hate more than a business who isn't prepared; hence, once you have made contact, be certain you possess relevant support material on-hand.
Keep a large library of videos, photographs, quotes and extra information prepared to send out - or better yet, on your site - in order for you to merely email a link.
Publish Yourself
There has been a major change within the media over the past couple of years - everybody now is a writer - therefore, take advantage within this shift of power and begin to get your own message out to your targeted audience.  Use these tools to help with this.
If you have developed a survey for a public relations campaign, turn these results into an infographic then post it on the Facebook business page. Or place exclusive news upon your blog, and tweet it to all of your followers.
Incredible content is going to be shared around several channels and spread the word for you!
Important Takeaways
Targeting the content to the proper media list is going to improve the efficiency of the plan for public relations. Integrate your public relations campaigns using inbound marketing in order to witness better results.

New Year s Resolutions: 10 Secrets of an Executive Recruiterreddit
My name is Mark Wayman and for the last 10 years I have owned an executive recruiting company focused on gaming and high tech. Over 600 successful placements with an average base salary of $200,000+.

Life Is Not Always Fair -- There are many times when life does not seem fair. You get fired, someone else gets your promotion, you don't get the job interview. Believe me, I see it regularly. A mediocre candidate beats out an outstanding candidate. People that make terrible business decisions just keep on finding jobs. Your current situation is typically determined by your previous choices and decisions, however there will be times when life just does not seem fair. You can't always control your circumstances, but you can control how you react to them. Focus on what you have, and don't obsess about things that can't be changed. Life is not always fair, but it is always worth living!
Don't Waste People's Time -- The number one fear of executives in America today is having their time wasted. If you are going to email or call, have something important to communicate. If your calls are not getting returned it's because you are not adding value. Remember that landing a new career opportunity is a high priority for YOU, not them. If you work with an executive recruiter, make yourself available. If a company calls you for an interview, juggle your schedule and make it happen. Translation: Make your job search a top priority. Don't waste people's time!
Be Tigger, Not Eeyore -- Whining is for kids... and it's not attractive even then. Of the thousands of executives I have interfaced with, do you know how many told me they got fired? Zero. The boss was a jerk, the company was screwed up, their wife was on my case, and/or they had a bad childhood. Step up and take personal responsibility for your career. It's not your bosses fault or the company's fault or anyone else's. Sometimes things just don't work out. Quit complaining and move on. Bitter is not attractive, and it one of the top issues I see in unemployed executives. As we say in Oklahoma -- saddle up and ride! Be Tigger, not Eeyore!
Don't Be a Carpet Bagger -- One of my least favorite phone calls goes something like this, "Yada, yada, yada, sorry I have not called you in five years, but can you get me a job?" Remember this; life is like a bank account. You have to make deposits before you can ask for withdrawals. And 80 percent of the top jobs will be found in your professional network, NOT through an online job posting. You need to foster long-term relationships so that when you need to call in a favor, it's there for you. Nobody likes a carpetbagger!
It Only Takes One Phone Call -- One phone call can change your life! Don't get discouraged thinking you'll never find a new job. You only need one job, so you only need to get one phone call. That call may come today or next week or next month. The timing is in God's plan; not yours. The call typically comes when you are at the end of your rope and can't take one more step. But remember this -- that call always happens. You only need ONE phone call!
Life Is Not One, Long Air Raid Siren -- Most people are on the treadmill of life. Go, go, go! Sun up to sun down. Bring home the latest work project and work until midnight, then double back to work at 6:00 AM the next morning. God gives us the freedom to choose what is right over what is pressing. If you are out of work, maybe this is a good time to slow down and reevaluate your priorities. There is no reason to live your life in the eye of a tornado. Get off the treadmill!
Run Your Own Race -- Don't measure your self-worth against other people's net worth. This is the primary source of stress in most people's lives. Getting that next promotion. Moving to a nicer neighborhood. Buying a new car. The stress to keep up appearances. Everyone does it, but remember that enlightened people never seek to be like others. Self-worth is not based on achievements or "stuff." Not by your $100,000 car or your multi-million dollar house. Let me know when they start putting luggage racks on the Hearse. Abundance is not defined by money or possessions; it's defined by your blessings. Health, family friends. Successful people don't need to prove anything. Run your own race!
Everything in Life is Relative -- When I was 18 I went on the Pro Bowlers Tour. In California, I was one of the top players. On the National Tour I was not in the top one hundred. No matter how good you are, someone else will always be better. When you get up in the morning remember that you live in America, the greatest country in the world. If you have your health and your family, everything else is a bonus. I am not trying to minimize the importance of your job search; just reminding you that unemployment is a temporary situation. Everything in life is relative -- this too shall pass!
Entitlement is an Illusion -- The number one cause of America's economic woes is the mistaken impression that someone owes us a living. Nobody owes you anything in this life. Want to know the secret?  HARD WORK.  Hard work and perseverance lead to success.  Don't believe me?  Number one answer of wealthy people when asked about their success -- hard work.  I was the first person in my family to graduate college. No scholarship -- just eight long years of night classes.  Then 20 years of busting my hum in corporate America.  And last, but not least, 10 years of hard work building by business.  Because when you own the company, if you don't sell... you don't eat.  Entitlement is an illusion!
The Happiest People on Earth Know their Purpose -- The happiest people in the world are those that have found their passion, and get up every morning to pursue it. They understand that significance is not about status or money or material possessions; it's about having a positive impact on the people around them. Serving others as opposed to serving self. The quality of your life comes down to the quality of your contribution. Givers are the most content, peaceful and happy people on the planet. Your life moves to a higher plane when you strive to make the world a better place. Live each day as though it were your last!
Let me leave you with my favorite quotation. This is from Mother Teresa, and it sums up the best way for us to live our lives.
People are often unreasonable and self centered. Forgive them anyway.
If you are kind, people may accuse you of ulterior motives. Be kind anyway.
If you are honest, people may cheat you. Be honest anyway.
If you find happiness, people may be jealous. Be happy anyway.
The good you do today may be forgotten tomorrow. Do good anyway.
Give the world the best you have and it may never be enough. Give your best anyway.
For you see, in the end, it is between you and God.
It was never between you and them anyway.

Ag Tech Is Very Important to Our Futurereddit
While Thanksgiving is a national holiday, it hits particularly close to home for us in Massachusetts -- after all, it originated in Plymouth. As we prepare for this year's holiday, we immerse ourselves in the signs of the season: crisp air, apple picking, fall leaves, and colorful food. Some of us might be busy planning our menus for Thanksgiving. Others might be contemplating signing up for that Turkey Trot. Either way you cut it, food is top of mind.
But how many of us stop to consider what is served in front of us and how it got there? It's not something we often think about, but the facts are staggering. The inputs into agriculture are enormous: about 12 percent of the earth's surface is cropland and the industry uses about 70 percent of our freshwater supply. Moreover, it is taxing on the environment with domestic ruminants as the primary contributors of methane and 70 percent of nitrous oxides coming from tillage and fertilizer use. And to top it all, it is estimated that in the U.S., about $165 billion worth of food is wasted every year. With a global population expected to reach 10 billion within the next 50 years, we'll need to increase food production by as much as 70 percent. Somehow, we'll need to get our act together quickly -- we'll simply need to do more with less.
Achieving this increase in global food production requires nothing less than a systemic transformation of the way we seed, harvest, and cultivate our food. The opportunities for entrepreneurs to build large businesses in agriculture are significant -- particularly given the advancements in biotechnology, robotics, low-cost sensors and big data analytics. However, agricultural value chains are complex and bringing a product to market in this type of environment can be extremely challenging. Timelines may be slower, costs higher, and the "right industry connections" ever more important.
Despite these challenges, the combination of such a critical problem, a massive market (estimated at $120 billion in net farm revenue today), and the potential for technology to make a difference undoubtedly point to agriculture as a compelling place for innovation. Moreover, there are ways to mitigate the challenges of the industry. Entrepreneurs should not have to embark on the journey alone. For example, Farm2050 is a collective of industry partners in agriculture with the mission to catalyze groundbreaking innovation by providing entrepreneurs with the network and resources required to build the foundation for a better agricultural future. It's a new type of support ecosystem that goes far beyond capital. Unique in its ability to offer assistance with industrial design, manufacturing, testing, and industry networking, Farm2050 is excited about lowering the barrier to entry for these entrepreneurs who are working to build the foundation for a more efficient agricultural future.
As we reflect on our appreciation for food and what it stands for -- community, culture, and a centerpiece of society -- we recognize how important food is. We are starting to understand how evolving technology in agriculture over the years has enabled the phenomenal growth we've seen recently and that technology will continue to enable the world's future growth. We can think of few causes more worthy of our industry's time, investment, and dedication.

Giving Tuesday  Goes Viral With Help of the Web and Mobile Apps
Open-Source Beer: Why One Brewery is Sharing RecipesEmail
Tin Whiskers Beer
For a craft brewery, a good beer recipe can be the key to success. So why would one give it away?
In St. Paul, Minnesota, the Tin Whiskers brewery only started hand-bottling its beers a couple of weeks ago, but it has already shared the recipes online. That means if you want to learn how to make its Flip Switch IPA, you can just visit its website  and get a detailed list of ingredients and brewing instructions. 
The idea is to maintain an "open-source brewery." Instead of sharing computer code, the brewers are sharing the recipes for their beers. It makes sense that the Tin Whiskers' three founders — Jeff Moriarty, Jake Johnson and George Kellerman —all have degrees in electrical engineering. 
"It allows us to have a deeper relationship with our most loyal customers," Kellerman told TODAY. "They can brew some of the beers that we have made and we can taste what they have done. If you don't have that open mentality, you can't really have that relationship."
That business philosophy also leads to an exchange of ideas — customers get the benefit of the trio's expertise, while the brewers get to taste the fruit of unconventional ingredients and brewing methods without spending too much time and money experimenting for themselves. 
Plus, they have a special affinity for home brewers, since that is how they started out in 2006. In fact, through the end of December, they are  encouraging people to bring in their own homemade creations in exchange for free beers from Tin Whiskers. 
Video: Craft beer is a growing portion of the beer market, now a $14.3 billion industry with 3,093 breweries across the U.S. Nowhere is that more apparent than Asheville, North Carolina, which has the highest ratio of breweries per capita in the country. NBC’s Kerry Sanders reports.
From those who choose to share their recipe with the public, Tin Whiskers will select their favorite and — with the help of the person who made it — brew, name and sell the beer. 
Ultimately, Kellerman isn't too worried about some competitor putting out their own version of something like Tin Whiskers' Short Circuit Stout. 
"That's not really in keeping with the spirit of the craft beer world," he said. "Most brewers are trying to make their own mark instead of capitalizing on someone else's success."

If you want to know what to invest in during December, think small and think close to home.
Investors that watch seasonal patterns in the stock market have noticed shares of small companies are increasingly becoming the place to be in December. This has to do with how traders are attempting to game the so-called January effect -- where small stocks beat the market in January -- by jumping in before the end of the year.
Another key trend for investors to watch this month is the tendency of home related stocks to perform well. Homebuilders for instance, have been the best performers in the month of December over the past 24 years.

00:05  You might not associate Santa Claus with a stock market
00:08  that Walsh Richard does. I'm John Wagoner and this is America's
00:11  markets. December's the second month and historically strong period for stocks
00:16  and the second best month for Dow Jones Industrial Average the
00:19  past half century. It's also in the Santa Claus rally takes
00:22  place this seven sessions spurt that begins at the end of
00:25  December has delivered gains every year since 2009. Even though the
00:30  market is already racked up an impressive performances at record levels.
00:33  Odds are good for the rally to continue because the Federal
00:36  Reserve isn't likely to change its easy many ways until wages
00:39  pick up. Something that's not gonna happen for awhile. If recent
00:43  patterns persist home builders will be one of the best performing
00:46  industry sectors as 2014 closes out. And small company stocks could
00:51  prosper as investors try to get ahead of the group's traditional
00:54  January rally. Technology stocks which offense sputter about now. Could bucked
00:59  that trend thanks momentum in big games like apple and FaceBook

01:09  in retailers offer way to play. Important shopping season trends this
01:13  year but if you're thinking about buying and mutual fund this
01:15  month think again he's also get hit with an unnecessary tax
December is shaping up to be the final act of a solid year for stocks. The S&P 500 is up more thank 10% already. Shares of small companies are of special interest since they've been bouncing back after lagging. The Russell 2000 index of small stocks is up 0.7% this year, getting back into the black after being crushed in the October swoon. But since October, small caps have been racing back, making some wonder if December is their month to glisten.
"There are a lot of reasons small caps can do well," says Jack Ablin of BMO Private Bank. "I think they're expensive, but they could make an interesting short term trade."
Regan: Stock rally not done because it's 'game on' for the Fed
Traders are liking December since small-stocks not only tend to beat the big guys through January, but the period of outperformance is revving up in the final month of the year. The Russell 2000 has gained 4.7% between Dec. 15 and January 31 on average over the past 35 years, says the Stock Trader's Almanac. That easily tops the 2.7% average gain of the large-company focused Russell 1000 during the same period.
But here's where things get interesting. Small caps gained 3% between Dec. 15 and Dec. 31 on average, which is 60% of the total "January Effect" gain. That means investors who jump in early catch more of the rise.
Small caps have more than just the calendar helping them at the end of the year, too, Ablin says. Investors are more bullish about the U.S. economy than abroad -- and that's good news for small companies which tend to be more focused on the U.S. economy, Ablin says.
December isn't just a battle between large and small stocks. Investors also see industry and sector trends during the month worth paying attention to. And it's clear what investors have on the mind: home-related stocks. Homebuilding stocks are the top performers gaining 8.4% on average in December the past 24 years, according to data from S&P Capital IQ's Sam Stovall. And get this: Homebuilding stocks have topped the S&P 500 91% of the time.
Investors' infatuation with real estate runs deeper than just the homebuilders. The second-best performing industry include companies in building products. Stovall says this industry is gained 6.6% on average in December the past 24 years and beaten the S&P 500 74% of the time.
If there's a group to avoid in December, technology might be it. The information technology sector has gained just 0.9% on average the past 24 years in December, Stovall says. That's about half the average 1.9% gain of the S&P 500 during the month. And tech stocks have only beaten the market 35% of the time during December.
December can be surprising. Big mutual funds tend to dump their losers and pile into stocks that have been working this year during the month, so they can make their year-end reports look impressive. That means winning stocks can get an extra lift and losers' pain get exaggerated. This year-end rush would be yet another vote for small company stocks as managers scramble to add small stocks as they perform better, says Ablin.
"When investors start to pile on, that tends to be bullish," Ablin says.

Max India, Reliance Capital Soar on Reports of Breakthrough in Insurance Bill

Oil Slumps Near $59 for First Time Since 2009 on Oversupply
Shares in insurance companies rose sharply on Wednesday on reports that the BJP and Congress have reached an agreement to break the impasse on the Insurance Bill. The Bill, proposed in August, aims to lift the cap on foreign investment in insurance ventures from 26 per cent to 49 per cent.
The opening up of the insurance sector will inject more funds into the world's 10th largest market, where fewer than 4 per cent of Indians have coverage.
Max India was the biggest gainer among insurance stocks, rising 7 per cent. Reliance Capital jumped over 4 per cent. Bajaj Finserv soared 6 per cent, while Exide Industries advanced over 1 per cent.
All these stocks outperformed the broader Sensex and Nifty, which traded flat for the third straight day.

Shares in Pratibha Industries fell as much as 10 per cent to a day low of Rs 46 on Wednesday.
Rating agency Crisil downgraded its long-term rating on Pratibha to BB + negative from BBB negative.
The rating agency also downgraded short-term rating of the company to A4+ from A3+.
The rating downgrade reflects the expectation of continuing pressure on the company's financial risk profile, according to Crisil.
As of 10.17 a.m. shares in Pratibha industries traded 5.17 per cent lower at Rs 48.60 apiece, underperforming the broader Nifty which was up 0.05 per cent.

Source: Cubs to strike 1 sign  shrink another in revised Wrigley proposal11
Specifically, the agency was concerned that the two video screens and five signs would take the focus away from the historic centerfield scoreboard and recommended the team reduce the number of signs, said Park Service spokeswoman Kathy Kupper.
In addition to removing a script sign in left field, the Cubs made several other concessions to receive the Park Service's approval of the signage, according to an agreement the agency provided the Tribune on Wednesday.
The proposed right-field video screen will shrink to 2,200 square feet from 2,400 square feet. It will also be moved closer to the foul line where the bleachers are not as tall. The new location allows the video screen to be set lower. A script sign that the Cubs planned to put in the same location will be moved closer to the centerfield scoreboard.
The Park Service also had concerns about the number of video screens in the ballpark. In light of the second video board in the outfield, the agency asked the Cubs to modify the LED video ribbon board planned for the fascia of the upper deck grandstand.
The agreement appears unclear on the future of those ribbon boards. Kupper said the Cubs would eliminate them entirely and replace them with billboards. However, Green said the Cubs have agreed only to reduce the length of ribbon board with the exact length to be determined.
If the Cubs eliminate one or more of the proposed outfield signs, the agency will reconsider the team's request for the ribbon boards, Kupper said.
In seeking the tax incentives, the Cubs are required to gain approval of the entire project from the Park Service, which determines whether the renovation of historic properties meets the Department of Interior's standards and is thus eligible for tax credits.
The federal government has promoted the tax breaks as a way to preserve historic commercial properties and encourage their contemporary use. The tax breaks are credited with saving Fenway Park in Boston, the oldest baseball stadium in the major leagues.
Once the Park Service determines that a project is eligible for credits, preservationists said, it typically takes an ongoing regulatory role, lending an additional layer of evaluation to the redevelopment of historic properties.
The Park Service reviewed about 40 amendments for the Fenway Park proposal, Kupper said.
"This is very standard, does not raise my eyebrows whatsoever," said McDonald, of Landmarks Illinois.
A key difference between the federal and local review processes is that Park Service officials may be less subject to political pressure than members of a local landmarks commission appointed by the mayor.
McDonald added: "I think (Park Service officials) have a different mentality in mind. They recognize that they are guardians for the taxpayers funding the preservation program in our nation."

Full of positive energy  Deven Verma truly belonged to a film set   says Deepti NavalWritten by Amruta Lakhe |
Posted: December 3, 2014 12:00 am | Updated: December 3, 2014 11:27 am
Deepti Naval, co-star of Deven Verma in many movies, remembers the warm and effortless actor who passed away in Pune on Tuesday.
Deven Verma was one of the most endearing people in the film industry, a delightful and natural actor. He stood out in every film he acted in, including Chori Mera Kaam (1975), Chor Ke Ghar Chor (1978), Khatta Meetha (1981), Angoor (1982), and Kissi Se Na Kehna (1983).
Unki sabhi yaadien bahot hi pyaari hain. Though I worked with him in other movies as well, my strongest memories are of Angoor. No matter how long or how demanding the shoot, we never saw him tense or nervous. Full of positive energy, he truly belonged to a film set.
Haribhai (Sanjeev Kumar) and he were a riot on the sets, they had a crackling chemistry and perfect comic timing. With Gulzarji
(director), they worked very closely for Angoor. Even when we didn’t have a shoot scheduled, we would drop by to watch the trio at work. This is why even when you watch the film today, their antics crack you up.
We kept in touch regularly. A few years ago, his wife, Rupa Ganguly, contacted me. She wanted to gather his co-stars, directors and writers together and prepare something for Devenji — a sort of tribute to his life and career. There was so much we wanted to say to him, to thank him for his influence in our lives and his contribution to the film industry. I can only imagine how happy it would have made him.
Unfortunately, before we could organise something, his condition deteriorated.
On November 28, I was in Pune performing the play, Ek Mulaqat. After the show, I called Rupa and expressed my wish to drop by. She said he would have been delighted to meet me, but he was very weak. As she put him on the phone, I thought of all the things I wanted to tell him: How much we love him and miss him, and how we wished he would get well soon. I tried to string together these thoughts as much I could in a brief telephone conversation. He listened to me patiently, and said, “Haan Deepti, thank you.” I was happy that he had recognised my voice and promised to see him when he was better. I didn’t know the end was so close.
December 2, the morning he passed away, was a sad day for me and everyone who knew this wonderful and warm person. I hope with that brief phone call, he realised what he meant to us.

SAN FRANCISCO     —     For years, Stephen Hawking has grappled with a communications system that can be maddening in its complexity. Commit one typo, and a comment is scuttled.
But new technology from Intel, announced Tuesday, will speed the process by 10 times and simplify it. That has Hawking excited for himself and millions of others with conditions that significantly hinder their ability to communicate.
How a groundbreaking device is helping Stephen Hawking communicate
In his only interview with a North American media outlet, Hawking, 72, talked with USA TODAY about Intel's technology, Pink Floyd and a recently released movie about him, The Theory of Everything.
The biopic depicts Hawking, the world's most well-known theoretical physicist and cosmologist, in his graduate-student days at Cambridge. There, he was diagnosed with motor neuron disease and met Jane Wilde, who became his first wife and the mother of his three children. Hawking is played in the movie by English actor Eddie Redmayne.
USA TODAY: What are your thoughts on constant connectivity and its effect on mankind? Does it help you connect with others?
Stephen Hawking: We are all now connected by the Internet, like neurons in a giant brain. Much has been said about the effect of social media, and I don't have much to add that is original. I had resisted social media until recently as a time-consuming invasion of privacy, but I was persuaded to open a Facebook page to communicate the importance of science to a wider audience. I hope my Facebook page will put an end to several fake Stephen Hawking pages, but it won't do anything for Twitter. The Internet has had a big effect on research in my field of physics. Up to the early '90s, people circulated paper pre-prints by mail. These often took several months to arrive, and went only to a small circle, mainly in the West. Now anyone anywhere in the world, can react immediately to new work. Science has become more inclusive.
“Communication is very important if one is disabled. Without it, one is powerless.”
Stephen Hawking
USA TODAY: How may your work with Intel  — and its new communications platform — benefit those who have MND and quadriplegia?
Hawking: Intel has developed a new communications program called ACAT (Assistive Context Aware Toolkit). This uses predictive text to speed up writing. It can handle files, mail and Internet, and it can switch windows easily. It can be operated by a single switch, which can be activated by hand or head movement. In my case, I operate ACAT by a small sensor on my glasses, which detects the movement of my cheek. Communication is very important if one is disabled. Without it, one is powerless.
USA TODAY: What do you think of The Theory of Everything? Does it capture your life's story?
Hawking: I was apprehensive about the film because it was based on a book by my ex-wife. But I was reassured when I read  the script, and even more so when I saw the screening. It was surprisingly honest about our marriage. I thought Eddie Redmayne's portrayal of me was very good. He spent time with people with ALS, to be authentic. At times, I almost believed he was me. Those who have seen the movie said it made a big impact.
This image released by Focus Features shows Harry Lloyd, left, and Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Hawking in a scene from "The Theory of Everything."

USA TODAY: Evidently, there is a new track on the new Pink Floyd album, out Nov. 10, called Talkin' Hawkin'. Did you collaborate on that? Listen to Pink Floyd?
Hawking: The track was taken from a BT commercial I made. At the time, it was the most expensive television commercial ever made. I only got to go to a fake Mayan temple in Pinewood Studios, but they sent my double to a real temple in Mexico, and to North Africa, where they filmed the remains of tanks, to show the stupidity of war.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, delivered the Budget Statement on Wednesday 19 March 2014, on the state of the national finances, Government's proposals for changes to taxation and growth forecasts.
The Autumn Statement provides the Chancellor an opportunity to update MPs on the Government’s plans for the economy based on the latest forecasts from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).

Provisional collection of taxes
In the Budget or Autumn statement some measures, such as any changes to the rates of duty on alcohol and tobacco, can come into effect on the same day or soon after.
 
The power to make these changes on an interim basis comes from the House of Commons approving a motion for the provisional collection of these taxes. 
This is called the 'Provisional Collection of Taxes' and is by convention agreed to by the House, meaning that the changes can come into effect on the same day.
Why is there an Autumn Statement?
The Government is legally required to publish a financial report on the state of the economy twice a year. From December 1976 until November 1992, the Chancellor of the Exchequer made an Autumn Statement to the House of Commons in addition to the annual Budget Statement in the Spring.
The Spring Budget and the Autumn Statement were merged and a "unified-Budget" was presented to Parliament in November 1993. The unified-Budget was then replaced in 1997 with the traditional Spring Budget and the publication of a new Pre-Budget Report in the autumn.
The coalition government announced in September 2010 that it would replace the Pre-Budget Report with an Autumn Statement. The Autumn Statement includes UK economic growth forecasts produced by the Office for Budget Responsibility.

He said: "Now that credit conditions for households and large businesses have improved, it is right that we focus the scheme's firepower on small businesses, which are the lifeblood of our economy."
The £500m of new bank lending will be allocated under the Enterprise Finance Guarantee Scheme which was set up by the former Labour government to encourage more bank lending to SMEs.
Under the scheme, the government guarantees 75% of an SME's bank loan, with the lenders covering the remaining 25%.
The additional money for this and the Enterprise Capital Funds are aimed at helping the government reach its target of unlocking £10bn of finance for SMEs by 2017/2018.
Apprentices
Mr Osborne also promised help for businesses who were creating skilled jobs through apprenticeships, especially young apprentices under the age of 25.
At the moment, businesses who employ apprentices are charged National Insurance. That will now be abolished.
Mr Osborne said: "When a business is giving a young person a chance in life we're going to support them not tax them."
He said that since 2010, almost two million people had taken up an apprenticeship, and there was a target to create three million apprentices in the next Parliament, should the Conservatives win the next election.
Downward spiral
The Bank of England and Treasury said the extension of the FLS scheme would complement the various other longer-term initiatives aimed at improving the availability of credit to SMEs.
The FLS scheme, a Bank of England and Treasury scheme, started in August 2012 with the aim of making £70bn available to lenders.
The intention was to bolster the economy, by halting the downward spiral of both lending and borrowing that the UK had experienced since the onset of the credit crunch and international banking crisis.
It enables commercial banks to borrow funds from the Bank of England cheaply, so that they can then pass this on in the form of cheap loans to firms.
Banks were initially able to use the FLS to boost mortgage lending, but since the start of this year it has only been available for loans to firms.
Narrower focus
Its focus will now be narrowed further, with banks now only able to use FLS for lending to SMEs.
The scheme, which has already been extended once and was due to finish at the end of January, will now run until the end of January 2016.
So far it has failed to increase net lending to small businesses, despite lenders drawing nearly £48bn ($75bn) from the scheme.
Figures from the Bank of England last week showed that lenders using the scheme cut net credit to small businesses by £128m in the three months to September, although this was the smallest reduction this year.
Labour said Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne had "failed" to increase lending to businesses.
"Labour will back British businesses by cutting business rates for small firms and setting up a proper British Investment Bank so that firms can get the finance they need to expand," a party spokesperson said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has convened a meeting of chief ministers in the national capital on Sunday (December 7) to seek their views on the structure and functioning of the revamped Planning Commission, Tripura Chief Minister Manik Sarkar said in Agartala on Wednesday.
PM Modi in his first Independence Day speech had announced that the Planning Commission would be abolished and replaced with a more relevant institution.
The meeting has been called to obtain opinions about the new body that would be formed after abolishing the existing Planning Commission , Sarkar told IANS.
Sarkar, however, did not elaborate on what his suggestions would be on the new panel.
"I would attend the meeting and submit my opinions," Sarkar added.
A senior official of Tripura's planning and coordination department said that the commission has received many suggestions regarding the name and role of the new body .
"Some of the suggested names of the new body include, National Development Reforms Commission, Sustainable Development Commission, National Development Agency, Social Economic Development Commission or Bharat Pragati Lakshya, Niti Aayog or Policy Commission," the official added.
Planning Minister Rao Inderjit Singh said in the national capital recently that the Planning Commission would continue to function under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister. A new body would replace the commission but till then, the existing entity would continue performing its mandate, Singh had said.

Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has slapped a penalty totalling Rs 8 lakh on six companies for non compliance to applicable norms with regard to online complaint system.
In six separate orders, Sebi has imposed a penalty of Rs 1.5 lakh each on Wellington Commercial, Sumati Industrial Finance, Shree Krishna Jute Products, Port Shipping Company and Rs 1 lakh each on T&I Projects and Surana Metals.
According to the Sebi, four firms - Wellington Commercial, Sumati Industrial Finance, Shree Krishna Jute Products, Port Shipping Company - had not obtained the registration with its online investor redressal system, SCORES, within the stipulated time frame.
While T&I Projects and Surana Metals had erroneously taken a SCORES registration, which is meant for investors, instead of SCORES authentication as mandated.
In 2012, it had directed all listed companies to get SCORES authentication by September 14, failing which they would have to face enforcement action.
SCORES, launched by Sebi in June 2011 provides a centralised database of all complaints, online movement of complaints to the concerned listed companies and online upload of Action Taken Reports (ATRs) by the concerned companies.
It also helps investors view, track and follow up the actions taken on their grievance.
The online redressal system has significantly helped reduce the processing time of complaints.

Lufthansa pilots to strike again on long-haul on Dec 4Lufthansa pilots to strike again on long-haul, cargo flights on December 4

Germany's national carrier Lufthansa is set to be hit after a leading pilots' union said they would strike on long-haul and cargo flights on December 4, after a two- day stoppage stranded thousands of passengers of Europe's biggest airline.
Shortly before their strike ended at midnight last night, the pilots' trade union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) said their industrial action will resume at 3 am local time on December 4 and will continue until midnight.
"Lufthansa's domestic and medium-haul European flights as well as the services of its subsidiary German wings will not be affected by the strike, which will be limited to the airline's international and cargo flights", the union said in a release.
Lufthansa said it expected its domestic and European flights to return to normal operations on Wednesday after the ninth strike this year called by the trade union in a dispute over the pilots' pre-retirement benefits forced the airline to ground around 1,400 flights on Monday and Tuesday.
It estimated that more than 150,000 passengers have been affected by the two-day strike.
"The airline will publish a special flight schedule for its international flights tomorrow to enable as many passengers as possible to reach their destinations", it said in a statement.
The latest strike was called by the union representing around 5,400 Lufthansa pilots after a new round of negotiations with the management to resolve their long-running dispute broke down in Frankfurt over the weekend.
VC said it decided to resume the strike on Decmber 4 as the negotiations showed substantial differences with the management.
The pilots launched their industrial action in April to force the airline to keep its present pre-retirement scheme for pilots, which allows them to retire at the age of 55 and receive 60 per cent of their last salary until they reach the retirement age.
Lufthansa wants to abolish the scheme and to raise the pre-retirement age to 61 as part of its efforts to cut costs in order to remain competitive against major international carriers, especially from the Gulf countries.
Lufthansa pilots are also opposing a management plan to expand its low-cost operations, which would enable the airline to compete more efficiently with budget airlines on European and international routes.
The airline is reported to be planning a new low-cost subsidiary for lucrative long-haul routes.
The pilots' strike is estimated to cost Lufthansa between 15 and 20 million euros a day.
Its total losses since the strike began in April could be around 170 million euros, media reports said.

IBM signs $1.25 billion WPP cloud dealIBM signs $1.25 billion WPP cloud deal
Eric Auchard     London   Last Updated: December 3, 2014  | 12:52 IST
IBM is enjoying a wave of major technology outsourcing deals from European customers in the fourth quarter and the new contract signings are not over yet, an executive for the computer services giant said in an interview.
Late on Tuesday, IBM announced the third in a string of billion dollar plus contracts, saying it had won a seven-year, $1.25 billion deal with WPP, the world's top advertising firm , to run WPP operations in the cloud.
On Monday, IBM disclosed a multibillion-dollar deal to provide computer infrastructure services to Dutch bank ABN Amro. And last month, Lufthansa agreed a $1.25 billion contract for IBM to take over the German airline's information technology operations and staff.
Bart Van den Daele, IBM's general manager for strategic outsourcing in Europe, said big contract signings slowed in the depths of the euro crisis but that the region's customers are ready to play catch-up.
"(There's) a new wave of these deals which is still continuing and we see it going forward," Van den Daele said in a phone interview, referring to cloud contracts. He did not specify, however, whether these deals would be similar in scale to the recent billion-dollar plus awards. "Now you see the first results with Lufthansa, ABN Amro and WPP and there will be others," he added.
The common theme among European customers is their growing willingness to embrace the global corporate shift to Internet-based computing, or so-called cloud services, but while demanding several local twists, he said.
IBM seeks to differentiate its offering by focusing on hybrid clouds, which mix together the private, on-premise computer systems for which it has long been known with newer public-facing Internet, mobile and analytics systems, allowing clients to move existing systems to the cloud at their own pace.
This hybrid approach means companies can wait for years before they consider moving their most sensitive core financial systems to the cloud computers. It also gives them the option of never having to move.
Secondly, European clients demand that their data remain stored locally in European data center, a requirement IBM has met by building seven public cloud data centers across Europe in London, Amsterdam, Paris and one in Germany, with another to follow there shortly.
WPP's deal will allow the London-based company to stitch together the operations of the more than 300 agencies it has acquired through a relentless roll-up of the advertising business over the past decade and more.
WPP signed its contract last quarter but it only went live recently, IBM's Van den Daele said. ABN was signed in the fourth quarter, while Lufthansa was also agreed this quarter but it won't start up until early 2015.

Analysts see 50 bps rate cut by RBI in Feb-AprRaghuram Rajan likely to cut rates by 50 bps in Feb-April: Analysts
BT Online Bureau     Mumbai   Last Updated: December 3, 2014  | 13:06 IST
RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan
A rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI) Governor Raghuram Rajan is now seen as a given, some analysts say.
In its monetary policy review on Tuesday, the central bank left key rates unchanged but sounded hopeful of inflation stabilising next year allowing it room to cut rates.
Analysts say the debate in the market has now shifted to the extent of rate cuts. Some expect RBI to cut rates by 50 basis points (bps) at one stroke sometime in Feb-April.
"Since the RBI believes that its actions will have a powerful signaling impact on investment sentiment , the first cut may well be 50 bps," Deutsche Bank says in a note.
Deutsche, Citi expect 100 bps in rate cuts between February 2015 and March 2016.

Government would bring in necessary changes in liquor policy: Oommen ChandyWritten by Shaju Philip | Thiruvananthapuram |
Posted: December 3, 2014 2:45 pm | Updated: December 3, 2014 3:57 pm
Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy on Wednesday told the Assembly that the government would bring in necessary changes in the new liquor policy .
Climbing down from his earlier adamant stand there wouldn’t be a review of the new liquor policy, Chandy said the policy would be altered factoring in practical and legal aspects.
The new liquor policy of the Congress government, which envisaged immediate closure of all bar hotels below the five-star category and total prohibition in a decade, had faced setback in the courts. Besides, the bar hotel owners allegation that finance minister K M Mani had accepted bribe for renewing the licence has put the government on the defensive.
After the bar hotel owners petitioned the high court against the closure of the bars, the court had allowed them to function until appeals in the issue were disposed. In another verdict, all four and heritage category hotels got a relief from the court. Taking a cue from that verdict in October, 22 new four-star hotels obtained a verdict on Tuesday to the effect they are given liquor licence.
Stakeholders in the tourism and hotel industry had warned the government that the new liquor policy would hit the state’s tourism industry, which is worth Rs 22,000 crores annually.
However, Congress state president V M Sudheeran, who is on a political tour which has liquor-free Kerala as one of the highlights, said there was no need for changing the liquor policy. Sudheeran told the media that he could not understand under what circumstances Chandy had informed the assembly that the policy would be watered down.
For the third consecutive day, the issue of liquor licence to bar hotels dominated the discussions in the state assembly. The Opposition alleged that the high court verdict to sanction liquor licence to 22 four-star hotels showed the government’s secret. deal with the bar hotel owners. It said the government was helping the hotel owners by delaying the appeal against the single bench’s verdict.

Selected quotes from eulogies and tributes to Phillip Hughes on Wednesday as Australia bid farewell to the cricketer at his funeral in his hometown of Macksville, New South Wales.
MICHAEL CLARKE (Australia Test and one-day international cricket captain, team mate of Hughes; in eulogy speech):
“I don’t know about you, but I keep looking for him. I know it is crazy but I expect any minute to take a call from him or to see his face pop around the corner. Is this what we call the spirit? If so, then his spirit is still with me. And I hope it never leaves.”
JASON HUGHES (Older brother; in eulogy speech):
“I couldn’t have asked for a better little brother. From a very young age, you were destined to be a rock star. You moved to Sydney at the age of 17 with 70 centuries already to your name, with your home-grown technique.
“All I ever wanted was for you to look up to me as your big brother. I still can’t believe that I’m here saying my final goodbyes.”

From morning to night, your beautiful smile always came out. Even if your life wasn’t going to plan. You never took anything for granted and always knew how lucky and blessed you were from everything that came your way.” JAMES SUTHERLAND (Cricket Australia, CEO; in eulogy speech) “Quite simply, the boy from this proud community of Macksville, personified the spirit of Australian cricket. Ever since Bradman, the image of the innocent country boy playing in the back yard, while dreaming of wearing a baggy green cap, has become entrenched in our psyche. It’s our foundation myth as a cricketing nation. And Phillip loved that dream.” INDIA PRIME MINISTER NARENDRA MODI (on Twitter):
Heart-rending funeral in Australia. Phil Hughes, we will miss you. Your game & exuberance won you fans all over! RIP.

Mentally challenged women  treated worse than animalsWomen in Indian mental homes 'treated worse than animals', says report
AFP  New Delhi, December 03, 2014
First Published: 12:19 IST(3/12/2014) | Last Updated: 00:51 IST(4/12/2014)

Intellectually disabled women in India are routinely locked up in institutions where they suffer sexual or other abuse and are "treated worse than animals", a report by a human rights group said on Wednesday.
Women are often dumped in overcrowded, state-run institutions lacking basic facilities in India, where mentally ill and disabled people are "ridiculed, feared, and stigmatised", the Human Rights Watch report said.
"Once they're locked up, their lives are often rife with isolation, fear and abuse, with no hope of escape," said Kriti Sharma, the report's author.
"Women and girls with disabilities face unique challenges -- including sexual violence and denial of access to reproductive health -- that men do not."
Called "Treated Worse than Animals", the report is based on interviews with 52 women and girls who were in or had been in institutions, along with those of 150 doctors and family members.
"The house aunty (staff member) who drops me to school hits me. She hits me here (in the institution) too. She slaps me hard with her hand," an 11-year-old said in the report.
"When she hits me, I feel like crying and I feel sad. I feel like crying in school too. I want to leave this place."
Some 1.5 million people suffer intellectual disabilities such as genetic Down's syndrome in India, while another 722,826 suffer from mental illnesses such as bipolar, government census figures show.
But experts say those figures are strikingly low for the world's second most populous country where many health issues go undiagnosed.
Vilas Bhailume, superintendent of a mental hospital in western Pune, said overcrowding was a major problem.
"We only have 100 toilets for more than 1,850 patients out of which only 25 are functional. The others keep getting blocked. Open defecation is the norm," he said in the report.
Women with a range of disabilities and illnesses such as schizophrenia are often admitted against their will by their families or legal guardians, despite the fact that forced institutionalisation is illegal in India.
"Relatives just dump patients at the hospital and think that's it. They put fake addresses and phone numbers on the registration forms so we cannot contact them again," a nurse at the Pune hospital said.
India's government launched a national mental health programme in 1982 to provide community-based services, but HRW says it is largely ineffective and lacks oversight.
Sharma said many of the women she interviewed were desperate to leave, describing their treatment as unbearable.
"Long-term warehousing of women and girls with disabilities is simply not the answer," she told AFP.

5 once-popular cars killed off with 'final editions'

LOS ANGELES -- Mitsubishi's Lancer Evolution remains one of the hottest-performing small cars on the market, but its heat hasn't extended to sales lately.
Mitsubishi officials said last week at the Los Angeles Auto Show that they're going to kill off the little Evo after the 2015 model year. But don't fret if you want one. It's one of the models from various makers celebrating their final years with long goodbyes designed to squeeze  a few more sales from nostalgic advocates.
They are usually classed as  "final editions."
Whether it's Volkswagen saying "adios" to the Eos hardtop convertible or Mercedes-Benz offering a "so long" to the AMG SLS brute, automakers are embracing a get-'em-before-they're-gone philosophy.
It's up to buyers to decide whether a model is, indeed, going away.
Mercedes turned right and created a new near-supercar, the Mercedes-AMG GT, to fill the void being left by the AMG SLS. Mazda sold out of 25th anniversary MX-5 Miatas earlier this year, but now has shown a shapely next-generation MX-5 Miata.
But often automakers just kill vehicle names outright and create for these a last, very public bow. Models on their last legs:
•Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution. The Evo will bow out next summer after a "special action model" is offered as a swan song. "It's a great 'halo" for for the brand, says  Don Swearingen, Mitsubishi's executive vice president in the U.S., of the Evo. "but at the end of the day, we only sell about 200 a month." Mitsu will move instead to hot-performing plug-in cars.
•Volkswagen Eos. The slope-backed steel droptop was a design marvel when it was introduced, but it has lagged on its high price. To make the Final Edition a "going out of business" deal at $39,985 including destination charges, VW has pounded on extras such as 18-inch allow wheels, backup camera and heated 12-way power seats.
"The decision to name the Eos 'Final Edition' was based on a desire to recognize the model for its unique content while celebrating the value it has brought to the VW lineup over the years," says spokesman Darryll Harrison. The naming protocol "has become a little bit of a tradition with some of our models."
•Mercedes-Benz AMG SLS. The supercar with nostalgic upward-opening "gullwing" doors became a favorite of car magazines as soon as it went on sale in 2010 because of its blistering performance and heritage.
The "Final Edition" made its debut at the auto shows last year, and the final run is limited to 350 units globally. A few remain "but are basically sold out," says Mercedes spokesman Christian Bokich.
As high-impact supercars go, though, it's being looked upon as a success. "The SLS definitely has a key place in automotive history and has gracefully exited the marketplace," he says.
•Toyota FJ Cruiser. Toyota says it built 2,500 of what it called the Trail Teams Ultimate Edition Cruiser as a swan song for the distinctive off-road vehicle.
The final FJ "pays tribute to the iconic Land Cruiser FJ40 of the 1960s, from which the FJ Cruiser draws its rugged DNA, inspiration and design," Toyota says.
"We created the Ultimate Edition to give the FJ a proper send off," says Sam Butto, a Toyota spokesman.
•Cadillac CTS-V Coupe. Cadillac said it would build 500 "limited edition" CTS-V performance cars based on the last-generation CTS for a 2015 model year even though a new V-Series is on its way for 2016.
Cadillac says the outgoing model is a way of celebrating the characteristics that defined the 2010 to 2014 models -- a 556-horsepower supercharged V-8 engine, Brembo brakes and magnetic-ride control.
But it is only a "stepping stone" to the next generation, Cadillac says.

blogs on a possible "Google tax"GSK hails Ebola vaccine breakthrough
At the Conservative Party conference in the autumn, the Chancellor could not have been clearer.
"You are welcome here in Britain with open arms," George Osborne said to technology companies including Google, Amazon and Facebook.
And indeed they are, according to their fans, for the thousands of often well paid jobs they create. And also for the support they give to small tech start-ups in places such as "silicon roundabout" in east London.
But, the Chancellor also had a warning.
"While we offer some of the lowest business taxes in the world, we expect those taxes to be paid."
Many technology companies have been criticised for paying small amounts of tax in the UK despite Britain being one of the most important online markets in the world.
UK consumers generate billions of pounds of revenue for technology businesses. We love Google, Facebook and Amazon and use them with a passion.
But, as those same companies never tire of telling you, corporate taxes are still low, because the system does not tax sales, it taxes profits.
And those profits are fiendishly difficult to pin down.
Intellectual property payments to holding companies, the movement of sales activity to lower tax jurisdictions and the cost of licensing fees to holding companies all confuse the picture and allow firms with very mobile business models (such as in the technology sector) to be highly tax efficient.
Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Google, said it was his financial duty to his shareholders to structure the company in such a way.
Abuse of trust
Others, though, argue that the law needs to change so that complex arrangements are cleared up and profits made in a country cannot be "diverted".
Mr Osborne has said he agrees.
"If you abuse our tax system, you abuse the trust of the British people," Mr Osborne continued in his speech to the Conservative conference.
"My message to these companies is clear. We will put a stop to it. Low taxes, but low taxes that are paid."
It was soon being briefed around the bars of Birmingham, where the conference was taking place, that the Chancellor was planning a "Google tax".
That is, a tax on technology companies that will mean them paying more in the UK rather than diverting profits to other countries with lower tax rates.
Indeed, it was soon clear that such a move was to be a centre piece of Wednesday's Autumn Statement.
One senior Government figure told me last month that it would be the single most important business announcement of the day.
Well, we will soon find out just how far the Chancellor has progressed on this issue.
Because taxing international businesses is harder than it might first appear.
Global deal
The problem is that tax on global corporations needs international agreement. And the process for achieving that is not yet completed.
The OECD group of leading economies, including the UK and Germany, are heading the drive for a global deal.
A policy paper in September looked at mechanisms for unwinding "hybrid mismatches" which companies use to avoid in-country tax.
The Government has said it wants to be one of the first to legislate when the rules are finalised, probably next year.
So, today, we are likely to hear more details of that process. And, possibly, plans for legislation in the next Parliament.
Which means that a new flow of taxes may not start coming the Treasury's way until 2017.
In the Statement, there could also be an announcement on a new requirement for companies to detail revenue and tax payments made country by country.
That way, the public at least has some idea of the tax contribution businesses make to the UK.
Companies such as Vodafone already do that, and Treasury officials have made it clear they like the model.
Three months ago Mr Osborne said he was going to act. Watch today's Autumn Statement closely, and see how much he is actually able to achieve.

Why is George Osborne intervening in the housing market?
For the first time in more than four decades the Government is getting back into the housebuilding sector
A few months ago, I wrote a column asking whether George Osborne was really a Conservative at all. My point was that when you looked at his tenancy of the public finances, he looked rather less hard-line than he sounds. A bit Keynesian, even.
Well today there’s yet more evidence of the Chancellor’s interventionist tendencies. According to his latest national infrastructure plan , he is giving the green light to a project to build 10,000 new homes at a disused RAF base in Northstowe.
Though the numbers are hardly enormous, the signalling is more significant. This is the first time that central government has got directly involved in homebuilding since 1971, when it built the Central Lancashire new town. Back then, direct interventions were all the rage — just think of Milton Keynes, which you can see being unveiled here.
Of course, in some senses, the Government has been involved in the housing market all this time. Local authorities still commission the construction of homes (but not so much as in previous years); the Treasury helps encourage home ownership directly through programmes like Help to Buy and indirectly by giving homeowners tax breaks (eg no CGT on your primary home). But this new intervention represents a real watershed.
It is a sign of how concerned the Chancellor is about the inability of the private sector to fulfil housing demand. That’s a story which is told by this chart, from the recent Lyons Review. As you can see, housing completions have fallen dramatically since the 1960s — something which was largely a consequence of the collapse in local authority and housing association building.
Now, central government will never be able to fill that gap. But the Chancellor’s new housing project is an aggressive signal that it is planning to take on this problem. In a sense, it is hinting that it may soon be a developer of last resort — in much the same way as the Bank of England is the financial system’s lender of last resort.
We had an early hint of this attitude at the Budget earlier this year, when it revealed that it was planning to override planning restrictions for its new garden city in Ebbsfleet.
However, these trends evolve slowly. It will take many years for the new housing supply currently being planned to be finished. But this intervention is a sign that the Chancellor recognises there is a crisis in housing supply — and that he is determined to do something about it.

Further information on these and other revisions can be found in the PSF statistical bulletin and in the articles available on the public sector finances guidance and methodology web page .
Annex A - Data tables
There are nine tables included as part of this bulletin. Most tables extend back to 1992/93 in financial years and 1992 in calendar years. However, table M7 extends back to 1995, and tables M5, M6 and M9 only cover more recent periods.
All values in the tables are at current prices and are not seasonally adjusted. The debt figures are at nominal value. That is the debt is valued at the face value of the debt, which is what the government will be liable to pay, and not the market value of the debt.
Table M1 shows the general government deficit and debt (in £ million and as a percentage of GDP)
Table M2 shows the general government debt by financial instrument (in £ million)
Table M3 shows transactions (or changes) in general government debt by financial instrument (in £ million)
Table M4 shows how the deficit can be reconciled with the changes in gross debt (in £ million)
Table M5 shows how the unconsolidated financial liabilities of central government and local government are consolidated to arrive at general government consolidated gross debt (in £ million)
Table M6 shows how the unconsolidated transactions (or changes) in financial liabilities of central government and local government are consolidated to arrive at consolidated transactions in general government gross debt (in £ million)
Table M7 shows how general government net borrowing (or deficit) is consistent with the general government net borrowing reported in the Public Sector Finances bulletin  of 23 September 2014 (in £ million and as a percentage of GDP). The implementation of ESA 2010 has resulted in both outputs having comparable numbers for these measures from 1995/6 onwards, and so Table M7 no longer shows the reconciliation between the two measures and may be of limited value.
Table M8R shows revisions in deficit and debt between the figures published in this bulletin and those published in the last bulletin in April 2014 (in £ million and as a percentage of GDP).
Table M9 relates to government activities undertaken to support financial institutions during the financial crisis.  It does not include wider economic stimulus packages. The table is presented into two parts. Part 1 shows the impact on government deficit from both the expenditure undertaken by government and the revenue received as part of these support measures.
Part 2 shows the impact on the government balance sheet from the support measures. Part 2 also includes estimates of the contingent liabilities that government is exposed to through the activities undertaken to support financial institutions. All figures are in £ million.
Annex B – Glossary
Net borrowing - measures the gap between revenue raised (current receipts) and total spending (current expenditure plus net investment).  A positive value indicates borrowing while a negative value indicates a surplus;
Gross debt - is a measure of how much the government owes at a point in time;
Gross domestic product (GDP) - a measure of the total economic activity in a country or region.  Therefore a country’s gross debt, represented as a proportion of their GDP, can be thought of as a measurement of that country’s ability to pay back its debt;
Asset purchase facility fund – an arm of the Bank of England able to purchase financial assets including government securities (gilts).  The APF has earned interest which is periodically transferred back to central government.

Background notes
Government deficit and debt under the Maastricht Treaty
Article 126 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (commonly known as the Maastricht Treaty) obliges member states to avoid excessive budgetary deficits. The Protocol on the Excessive Deficit Procedure, annexed to the Maastricht Treaty, defines two criteria and reference values for compliance. These are a deficit to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ratio of 3%, and a debt to GDP ratio of 60%.
EU Member States have to report their actual and planned government deficits, and their levels of debt, to the European Commission to specific deadlines twice each year. The estimates in this statistical bulletin are supplied to the European Commission by ONS in accordance with the schedules in the Excessive Deficit Procedure. Forecasts for future years are provided separately by HM Treasury.
The first deadline (1 April) is designed so that the European Commission can gain an early sight of Member States’ debt and deficit for the previous calendar year, and the second deadline (1 October) is to receive updates to these figures. However, for the United Kingdom, uniquely within the European Union, the Stability and Growth Pact sets the reference period to be the financial year (1 April to 31 March), recognising the different budgetary year arrangements in the United Kingdom. The second deadline (1 October) thus provides for the UK the first estimate for the latest financial year.
The Protocol on the Excessive Deficit Procedure defines Government deficit and debt following the rules and principles laid out in the European System of Accounts 2010. This is also the manual that governs the United Kingdom’s National Accounts.
Data quality
Data in this bulletin are consistent with those published in the latest Public Sector Finances statistical bulletin. A summary quality report (201.4 Kb Pdf) for the public sector finances is available on the ONS website. This report describes in detail the intended uses of the statistics presented in this publication, their general quality and the methods used to produce them.
Coherence
The net borrowing (or deficit) data in this statistical bulletin are based on those published in the Public Sector Finances statistical bulletin of 23 September 2014.
The estimate of GDP used in this bulletin is consistent with that published on 30 September 2014 in the UK National Accounts.
Relevance to users
The UK Statistics Authority (UKSA) conducted an assessment of the Government Deficit and Debt Statistical Bulletin in 2011 to ensure that the bulletin and its compilation methods fully comply with all requirements of the National Statistics Code of Practice. A report of their findings was published on 3 November 2011. Following work to comply with the requirements itemised in the UKSA report, the Public Sector Finances has had designation as National Statistics confirmed.
The United Statistics Authority has designated these statistics as National Statistics, in accordance with the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007 and signifying compliance with the Code of Practice for Official Statistics.
Designation can be broadly interpreted to mean that the statistics:
- meet identified user needs;
- are well explained and readily accessible;
- are produced according to sound methods; and
- are managed impartially and objectively in the public interest.
Once statistics have been designated as National Statistics it is a statutory requirement that the Code of Practice shall continue to be observed.
As part of our continuous engagement strategy, we welcome comments on how else we might improve the Government Deficit and Debt Statistical Bulletin.

changed the stamp duty system in ScotlandNew Scottish taxes in draft budget Watch
Homebuyers in Scotland will pay no tax on properties costing less than £135,000, Finance Secretary John Swinney has announced.
And a 12% marginal rate for houses costing more than £1m will come into force next April, when stamp duty is replaced north of the border.
Mr Swinney's plan came in his budget proposal for the year ahead.
Opposition politicians said the finance secretary had failed to live up to his promise of protecting health spending.
Under the government's new Land and Building Transactions Tax , a marginal tax of 2% would apply to the proportion of a transaction between £135,000 and £250,000, while a 10% rate will apply to those between £250,000 and £1m.
Mr Swinney told MSPs: "As a result of the rates I have announced today, nobody will pay tax on the first £135,000 of their house purchase. 5,000 more transactions will be taken out of tax, supporting first-time buyers and those buying properties in the affordable market."
ANALYSIS
By Douglas Fraser, BBC Scotland business and economy editor
"Remember the referendum campaign? Well, you'll probably also remember the warning that taxes are a volatile way of funding services.
That argument was mainly about offshore oil and gas tax, which is the most volatile of government funding sources.
But with the arrival of more modest tax powers at Holyrood with today's draft budget, MSPs are now required to develop a novel skill - handling the new uncertainty about how much money the new body called Revenue Scotland will collect.
This is obvious when you think about it: the link between tax-raising and tax-spending, and the realisation that has been absent from Holyrood thinking, that balancing the books involves more than one side of the ledger. But the implications are profound.
ANALYSIS
By Brian Taylor, BBC Scotland political editor
"The minister [John Swinney] insisted that 90% of folk would be better or no worse off under the new system.
Mr Brown [Gavin Brown of the Tories] scowled quietly, perhaps thinking of the 10% and their possible voting inclination.
"More generally, Mr Swinney was in the mode historical. This was, he said, the first time that a Scottish Parliament had been presented with tax proposals since before the Act of Union in 1707. That too had been about property tax.
"His approach in resuming taxation had been drawn from Adam Smith, the sage of Kirkcaldy who set out a series of maxims in 1776 to the effect that taxes should offer certainty, convenience and efficiency while being proportionate to the ability to pay."
Read more from Brian Taylor.......
The finance secretary also said tax would be reduced for a further 44,000 house sales up to the value of £325,000.
And he added that the 12% top rate would ensure the most well-off made a contribution to the public purse.
Under the new system, 90% of taxpayers and 95% of non-residential taxpayers would be better or no worse off, Mr Swinney added.
The new charges will mark the first time Scottish Parliament has levied taxation since the Union in 1707, made possible after new powers were devolved to Holyrood following proposals put forward by the Calman Commission on strengthening devolution.
"In exercising its first judgements on national taxes, this government has put fairness, equity and the ability to pay at the heart of what it has done," Mr Swinney argued.
"That is the benefit of putting decisions about Scotland's future in Scotland's hands."
Property tax winners and losers
A £130,000 purchase now would require a duty payment of £1,300 - but a £130,000 purchase next April won't require any tax payment.
A house bought at £136,000 in April 2015 would require a one-off payment of £20 - but a house bought at £136,000 now would require a one-off payment of £1,360.
A property bought at £300,000 in 2015 would mean a £7,300 charge [0% of £135,000; 2% of £115,000 and 10% of £50,000]. With stamp duty for a house at this price currently at 3%, the stamp duty payment would be £9,000.
A £3m mansion bought in April 2015 would bring a tax charge of £317,300. Purchase that now and you'd be paying £210,000.
Mr Swinney also said a new tax paid by companies and councils when they dispose of waste to landfill would be "revenue-neutral", with a standard rate of £82.60 per tonne and a lower rate of £2.60 per tonne.
Elsewhere, the finance secretary said the 2015-16 budget plan would see:
NHS funding increased to more than £12bn
£4.5bn of infrastructure investment secured to build new colleges, health facilities and schools
An investment drive of more than £390m to deliver 6,000 affordable homes, and £125m of additional support for the housing sector.
More than £300m over two years to extend child care to 600 hours for all three and four-year-olds and vulnerable two-year-olds.
However, some government departments face cuts to boost spending in other areas, including:
A £46m cut in the justice resource budget, which will be reduced to £2.5bn
Economic development agencies Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise face a £40m cut, with the savings redistributed to housing
The new ScotRail franchise, which begins in April 2015, will see a £46m cut in support for rail services, leaving a pot of £331m
Public sector pay restraint will continue for another year
Labour finance spokesman Iain Gray welcomed the move to replace stamp duty, but said successive Scottish budgets had failed to protect the NHS.
Labour finance spokesman Iain Gray criticised the government's NHS funding plan
Mr Gray said the budget showed a real terms rise of about 1% - less, he told MSPs, than a quarter of the increase planned in England.
"Health spending here has not kept up with increases, even compared to the Tory-run English NHS," said Mr Gray, adding: "Our NHS has had some £700m less than it should have, had he (Mr Swinney) kept his promises.
"Use of the private sector in our health service has spiralled. Plans are being made for around £450m of cuts to accommodate the resulting financial pressure."
Hard-working families
The Conservatives' Gavin Brown also questioned whether the extra £288m announced for the health service would meet the SNP's commitment to protecting the NHS budget.
And he attacked the new property tax, asking: "How can the cabinet secretary justify an eye-watering 10% tax on houses over the value of £250,000?
"There are pockets of this country, such as Edinburgh, where family homes for hard-working families are considerably in excess of that.
"We all understand that it increases as houses go up but 10% I think is difficult to justify."
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the budget, which still needs the final approval of parliament, needed further work to ensure it delivered for families.
Mr Swinney said his proposals would help first-time buyers
"We need to see action to restore college funding to 2011 levels, so more young people can get the best start in life, and on mental health so that these crucial services get the investment they need," he added.
Patrick Harvie, the Scottish Green co-leader, welcomed spending commitments on affordable housing, new colleges and the NHS - but said it was time to address the issue of council tax, which has been frozen since the SNP came to power in 2007.
"There is talk today of a historic moment as new tax rates are set, and yet the one major tax we've had control of since 1999 is council tax, which remains unfair and unreformed," he said.
Mr Swinney said Scotland's economy was back up to pre-recession levels, but added that finances still faced a squeeze on public spending, due to reductions in Scotland's Treasury-funded budget.
As the Westminster government attempts to reduce the nation's spending deficit, Mr Swinney said cuts to Scottish spending amounted to a 10% cut in real terms over five years, and capital spending cuts of more than 25%.

Monte Carlo IPO Opens; Angel Broking Says Subscribe
NDTV | Written By: Priyabrata Prusty | Updated On: December 03, 2014 12:48 (IST)
Monte Carlo Fashions to Raise Rs 350 Crore via IPO
Woolen and cotton apparel manufacturer Monte Carlo Fashions' initial public offer (IPO) opened on Wednesday. The issue will close on December 5.
The price band is Rs 630 to Rs 645 per share. Monte Carlo aims to garner Rs 342 at the lower end and Rs 350 crore at the upper end of the price band through this issue.
Through this public offer, Monte Carlo will issue 54.33 lakh equity shares for subscription. Monte Carlo is not issuing fresh equity shares under this issue, but it is diluting 25 per cent shareholding in the company.
As a result, promoters' stake in the company will come down from 81.06 per cent to 63.63 per cent. Mauritius-based private equity firm Smara Capital, which had acquired 18.51 per cent stake in the company in June 2012, will reduce its holding in the company to 10.94 per cent.
Here are some things to know about Monte Carlo Fashions:
Company profile: The Ludhiana-based company manufactures woollen and cotton apparel. It caters to premium and mid-premium branded apparel segment. It has nearly 200 exclusive outlets and over 1,300 multi brand outlets through which its products are sold. Monte Carlo has two manufacturing facilities in Ludhiana (Punjab).
Valuation:
The company had reported a profit of Rs 55.4 crore on sales of Rs 502 crore in the financial year 2013-14. Its reported earnings per share (EPS) for FY14 was Rs 25.5. At the lower end of the price brand the stock is valued at 24.8 times its FY14 EPS whereas its peers like KKCL (Kewal Kiran Clothing) and Raymond are trading at a valuation of 34.5 times and 27.7 times to its FY14 EPS respectively.
Should you buy?
Domestic brokerage Angel Broking recommends subscribing to the issue citing Monte Carlo's strong brand image, asset light model, healthy balance sheet with decent return ratio, positive operating cash flow and strong distribution network.
The brokerage says Monte Carlo's net sales have grown at a CAGR of 16.3 per cent over FY2012 to FY2014 and its net profit has grown at a CAGR of 5.8 per cent over FY2012 to FY2014. However the brokerage has highlighted that its gross profit margin (EBITDA margin ) has declined from 22 per cent in FY2012 to 18.7 per cent in FY2014, but it believes that margins are at sustainable level.
The company had generated a return on equity (ROE) of 14.6 per cent and a return on capital employed (ROCE) of 16.6 per cent in FY14, which is a decent return as per the brokerage.
Angel Broking has recommended to subscribe to the issue at the lower end of the price band from a two-year perspective. From a one-year perspective it sees limited upside potential in the stock as valuations seems to be fair.

Can technology be a catalyst for Smart City experimentsAccelerate India |  Dec 05, 2014, 08:27 AM 0thIST
Can technology be a catalyst for Smart City experiments?
Cloud, Mobility, Social collaboration and other technological advances are conveying a new power to cities, the one they need most and in ample measure
Educated cities, healthy cities, modern cities, proactive-postured cities, resilient cities, agile cities – no matter how you tag them – smart cities are here and about. And so is the massive and ever-penetrating presence of cloud, mobile and social technologies or sharing information collectively or a slew of advanced technologies, platforms and practices. If private sector was the one that embraced digitization first, well the government sector is catching up with breathtaking speed now.
Disruption and innovation is what Cloud, Big Data and Mobility have trickled in with and they are fast affecting ways where we enable good governance and impact citizen lives.
It’s a world where traffic is managed automatically, and artificial-machine intelligence is not a misnomer; a world where there is no need for meter readers and yet outages can be captured precisely, with power connected remotely, and households tracking energy consumption on their own. It’s an era where people don’t and won’t stand in eternal queues to get a stamp or a paper sheet from a bureaucrat.
These are times when everything, no matter how small or big, good or bad, is immediately relayed, broadcasted and sliced by citizens with their phones, their growing impatience for mediocrity, wastage and their now-powered-fingertips.
This is an age where people demand services real-time, with transparency and without errors. And it is technology that is bringing about this change, a move to a simpler world where not only things happen automatically but more importantly in a manner that is transparent and easily tracked.
In this day and age, tt is possible and desirable to shape eco-friendly cities which use innovative Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for bringing efficiency, speed and accuracy in the realm of public services and infrastructure. But they would need, among other levers, technological vision and ideas.
Consider this. Gartner, Inc. forecasts that 4.9 billion connected things will be in use in 2015, and will reach 25 billion by 2020. But while manufacturing, utilities and transportation will be the top three verticals using IoT (Internet of Things) in 2015; by 2020, the ranking will change with utilities in the No. 1 spot, manufacturing at second and government at the third rank with smart street and area lighting investments for example. This would mean a total of some 1.7 billion IoT units installed.
Digital sensing, computing and communications capabilities are giving organizations a new functionality that can tap and augment ‘digital voice’ in both new and previously passive objects that create and deliver an information stream reflecting their status and that of their surrounding environment.
This also means a new avenue for creating new services and usage scenarios and using built-in intelligence and connectivity for many areas. Similarly, new and powerful solutions for intelligence and analysis, surveillance, and emergency management that can vastly improve citizen and government relationships are emerging.  This propels broader digital inclusion and impact areas like more accessible, higher quality education, better access to healthcare services, help for individuals as well as communities to thrive and prosper, enablement of modern cities in operating more efficiently, and a novel approach to addressing tough challenges like energy and water efficiency and cleaner forms of transportation.
Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft had remarked recently that “With more than 250 million Indians using Internet-connected devices today, there is incredible demand and opportunity for India and cloud services through local datacenters, making Digital India a reality.”
There are now new possibilities in e-governance, financial inclusion, healthcare and education.
Cloud with its elasticity, openness, scalability, affordability helps governments reach giant goals without stretching beyond pragmatic boundaries. Mobility and collaboration on the other hand, helps them walk at the same pace as their citizens and stakeholders are jogging at. A good government can use today’s technology as answers for doing the fundamentals really well, for empowering users in making better and informed decisions, and for connecting to citizens directly for feedback. This new cornucopia can also assist massively in delivering contemporarily-relevant services to the citizen and in keeping people safe and secure.
Surat, for instance is endeavoring to use a combination of cloud technology, mobile applications, data analytics and social networks to provide real-time data of all civic services, wherein systems can tackle natural disasters more effectively with the use of information technology and present systems are enhanced for and integrated with digital world.
It would use, among other things, GIS and information systems like for capturing accurate data and ways to make e-governance more user-friendly, for better and simpler town planning and more areas of safety and services.
Another big area of concern is disaster management, technology can play a very critical role in this aspect. Take the recent instances of Cyclone Phailin or even Cyclone Nilofar, with continuous satellite tracking and frequent updates, the damages were minimized to a great extent. And disasters are not always the natural types, it can also be in the form of epidemic or outbreak of diseases. For example, data intelligence and analytics can play a big role in the way countries or for that matter cities manage the outbreak of Ebola. By effectively isolating the cases and quick quarantines, the impact of the disease can be limited to a great extent. This is where technology and its proactive usage scores over everything else.
For any city to actually turn into a smart one that throbs with intelligence and agility it is vital that it uses technology that is simplified, flexible, scalable and easy to plug in. Plus it should be citizen-friendly, in fact, citizen-centric and to a reasonable extent, affordable, familiar and easily usable.
Doing new and more with less is the big shift. This shift, gathers acceleration and a long-term stability, when it is fuelled with technology. Smart cities, in short, are technologically-powered cities.

The challenges of urbanizationAccelerate India |  Dec 04, 2014, 03:40 PM 0thIST
The challenges of urbanization
India’s rapid population growth and the economic boom over the past two decades have propelled the phenomenon of urbanization, hitherto a rather slow process in India, into one of the foremost concerns of policymakers, economists, activists, and ordinary citizens. The government of India estimates that within 20 to 25 years, an additional 300 million Indians will be added to the nation’s urban population, and the total population is expected to reach 1.5 billion in that period. This population explosion is unprecedented in our nation’s history – these new urban citizens will have to be accommodated in cities that even today fail to provide basic infrastructure and services to their residents, with spiraling real estate costs and unplanned, rampant construction of housing and commercial projects.
Coping with urbanization
Policymakers have sought to address and manage the problems of urbanization through investment in urban infrastructure and civic services. However, before we undertake these grand initiatives, we must seek to deconstruct and understand the specific challenges that urbanization presents, and solutions that have been proposed or implemented.
Urban infrastructure and investment
One of the foremost problems of urbanization is building sustainable urban infrastructure, which includes urban streets, water supply infrastructure, sewerage and drainage systems, waste management systems, and urban lighting systems, among many others. The Planning Commission states that India spends only $17 per capita on urban infrastructure, whereas we should be spending $100 per capita. The Commission also estimated that the total investment required over 20 years to build urban infrastructure would be $1 trillion, a truly staggering sum!
Transportation and connectivity
Ensuring efficient transportation and connectivity is vital for modern urban life. Transportation infrastructure needs to keep up not only with the growth of new cities, but also existing regions that currently suffer from poor connectivity. India’s railway network, though one of the largest in the world has grown by only 19% since the British departed for their rain-soaked land. Many cities in the northeast do not have railheads and must instead depend on a road network that is susceptible to frequent closures due to landslides and inclement weather. With respect to air traffic, new airports are necessary to facilitate the free movement of people, goods, and commerce.
New cities being developed must ensure that they provide excellent connectivity to other parts of the country and indeed to the rest of the world. For example, the upcoming Gujarat International Financial Tec (GIFT) City is located only 18 km from Ahmedabad airport and is well-connected by road to other cities in Gujarat and Maharashtra.
 
Power and water supply
Power generation is yet another challenge that must be met head-on – India had a peak power deficit of 15% in 2008, which is estimated to worsen to over 20% in 2017. Given the extent of load-shedding, new satellite towns and cities must not rely entirely on the electricity grid, but instead supplement this with electricity from renewable sources like windmills, solar panels, hydroelectric dams, and others. For instance, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has identified 48 cities to be developed as “Solar Cities”. Tamil Nadu has made great strides in bringing clean energy to its cities, while Lavasa is trying to generate 10–15% of its energy needs through renewable means. These are admirable initiatives, but a lot more needs to be done.
The problem of water supply is similarly staggering in scale. The World Bank predicts that India will face severe water crisis by 2050, while the government’s figures show that even today, 22 out of India’s 32 largest cities face near-daily water cuts caused by burgeoning demand. In Mumbai and Delhi, the gap between demand and supply of municipal water can be as much as 25%. How could this problem be resolved? “Smart” technology can play a role in reducing wastage and streamlining water usage – “smart” water meters are now being installed in cities like Mumbai, Navi, Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore. Similarly, some cities are mandating that new construction projects install innovative technologies like low-flow plumbing and wastewater reuse, and also require them to augment municipal water supply with alternative sources like rainwater harvesting.
 
Environment and sustainability
Energy and environment are going to be one of the most critical factors which citizens will weigh the livability factor of a city. A healthy environment that is good and congenial for the life and work, is one of the prime necessities of any individual. Any discrepancy on that front can be detrimental not only for the people living in it, but also to the city as a whole. Take the case of Beijing, the capital of China. It is one of the most modern of cities with sky-touching towers, and expressways. Yet, the smog that envelopes the city spoils the image of the city as a whole. In fact, during the Beijing Olympics in 2008, one of the prime concerns for all the athletes and attendees was the environment of the city.  A city that is smart is also a city that is environmentally sustainable.
Meanwhile, keeping in mind the rises prices of electricity, energy efficiency is no more a fancy term but a necessity. With the use of automated metering, households can schedule their workload based on the time when the electricity usage is minimum. Meanwhile, with energy-efficient housing, that makes use of renewable energy like solar, and so on, the energy bills can be drastically cut. Modern smart cities are the ones that are not only energy-efficient but also to a great meet their own power requirements.
In the end, there are up teem challenges that lie on the path to smart city. For instance, one of the biggest questions is whether smart cities should be built ground up or existing cities should be systematically converted in a well-thought out manner. Considering the huge costs involved required in land acquisition, displacement of existing population, and a new build-up, reworking an existing city and fine-tuning it makes a much greater sense.
 
In the end, becoming a smart city improves efficiency, creates a positive environmental impact, enhances security, improves health, and simplifies construction permitting. These results lead to a more livable, appealing, and economically viable city that is attractive to new citizens and businesses.

Investors lapped up more shares of  TVS Motor Company on Wednesday after Goldman Sachs resumed coverage on the stock with a buy rating and added it to conviction list. The stock gained as much as 6.5 percent intraday, in addition to 3 percent gain in previous session.
The brokerage expects the stock to touch Rs 345 level in next 12-month, implying 46 percent potential upside from current levels.
In a note to clients, Goldman said TVS could benefit significantly from shift to scooters trend (26 percent of its 1HFY15 volumes) and bridging gaps in its motorcycles product portfolio through 1HCY15.
The brokerage expects TVS to post 49 percent earnings CAGR over FY14-FY18E with operating margin expansion of 4 percentage points to 10 percent, led by 19 percent volume CAGR and product mix improvement.
TVS Motor, one of the largest two-wheeler makers, recorded a 36 percent sales growth in November at 2.2 lakh units compared to 1.62 lakh units in same quarter last year. Exports grew by 55 percent year-on-year to 39,215 units.
Goldman feels TVS could benefit from strong scooter segment growth and ramp-up in key model Jupiter as scooters account for 35 percent of its volumes in FY18E from 24 percent in FY14; motorcycle launches; and margin expansion.
Key risks, according to the brokerage are failure of launches, lower-than-expected 2-wheeler demand due to unfavorable macro, intensifying competition, increase in commodity prices hurting margins, and sustained losses in Indonesia subsidiary.
At 12:43 hours IST, the stock was quoting at Rs 244.60, up Rs 12.30, or 5.29 percent on the BSE.

Centre contradicts BJP chief Amit Shah, says Saradha scam money not linked to Burdwan blasts

New Delhi: In an embarrassment for Bharatiya Janata Party president Amit Shah, the Narendra Modi government on Wednesday contradicted him on the Burdwan blasts by saying there was no link between Saradha chit fund scam money and blasts.
The comment came in a response to a question in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday. Minister of State for Prime Minister's Office Jitendra Singh replied, "So far investigation into Saradha chit fund scam does not show its money was routed to Bangladesh to fund terror activities."
Amit Shah had at a rally in Kolkata on Sunday linked the Saradha scam to the recent Burdwan blasts. "The investigations of the Burdwan Blast and Saradha scam are going to cross each other's paths.
#winter session #parliament #tmc #bjp
There are reports that money from the Saradha scam was used in the Burdwan blasts," the BJP leader had said. He had also accused the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government of shielding the culprits of the multi-crore Saradha scam. He dared West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to declare those rounded up by the CBI in the case innocent.
Soon after Jitendra Singh's statement, the TMC hit out at Shah saying he had lied that Saradha scam money was used to fund Burdwan blasts. The allegations by Shah also led to war of words between the two parties with the TMC protesting outside Parliament over Shah's alleged links with the Sahara group.
In fact, Mamata Banerjee and her MPs have been on an offensive against the BJP ever since the Lok Sabha election results. She had on Tuesday urged the opposition parties to unite against the Narendra Modi government in Parliament.

Loan repayment: Which one should you get rid of firstYou are here: Home > Collections
Which loan should you pay off first?
Sanjeev Sinha, ECONOMICTIMES.COM Dec 3, 2014, 02.24PM IST

(Personal loans top the priority…)
Loans are an important part of modern day finance. Most of us rely on loans for funding things like higher education, buying cars and jewellery or going in for a home of our choice. Though loans boost our purchasing power, however, over-reliance on any kind of debt often leads to a strained financial life.
No wonder, one important question that many financial advisors often face from individuals is, when should they close their loans? "Exit strategy from the existing debts plays an important role in minimizing the interest burden on individuals. But there is need to prioritize your loan repayments because this ensures that your loans can be cleared in a systematic way to boost the available monthly surplus," says Nitin Vyakaranam, founder & CEO of ArthaYantra, an online financial planning firm.
Some experts suggest that you should pay off your debts from the highest interest rate to the lowest, as this will save you the most money over time. But there are also some other things to consider while prioritizing your loan repayments. Here we take a look at which loans should you pay off first and why:
Personal Loans
Personal loans top the priority list when it comes to paying off an existing debt. Personal loans are unsecured loans which are advanced on the basis of the borrower's credit history and ability to repay the loan from the available income sources.
"Being an unsecured loan, personal loans are often offered at a higher interest rate. A higher interest rate necessarily means higher EMI payments. Though the charges for personal loan repayments are also on a higher side, it is always advisable to close this high interest debt once an individual has enough surpluses," informs Vyakaranam.
Unproductive loans
Loan instruments such as gold loans, loan against property, loan against fixed deposits and insurance policies, loan against PF and auto loan do not attract any tax benefit. Such loans should be paid off based on the interest burden. The interest rate on gold loans and loan against property, for instance, is dependent on the pledged value and the loan amount.
For example, if an individual opts for 50% of the value of gold as loan, he/she is expected to get a better rate compared to those opting for the 80-90% of the value as loan. These loans hold a lesser interest rate compared to personal loans. Loans against fixed deposits, insurance and PF attract lower interest rates than the gold loans and loans against property.
  Educational Loan
The increasing educational expenses have aided in the increased demand for educational loans. Educational loans should be given second least priority before closing off the existing debts. The reason behind it would be the tax savings one can enjoy on the educational loans. One can claim tax benefit on the interest payments being made towards educational loan availed from approved institutions. So essentially the interest payments can be offset by the tax benefit and hence one is advised to pay off educational debt only after paying off other debts.
Home Loan
Home loans are the most common form of debt among the Indians. One can avail tax benefits on both the principal home loan repayment and interest payments on the home loan. The tax advantage makes the home loan the last debt an individual should pay off. The exit strategy for home loans also differs based on the tenure and the type of house. Generally in the initial years, majority of the EMI payments account for interest payments and during the last few years of the loan tenure they account for principal repayments.
Therefore, "it is advisable to consider prepayment during the first half of the loan tenure. If an individual has two existing home loans, then only interest payments on the second home loan, which is not self-occupied, are tax deductible. However, there is no cap on this deduction. So considering the tax benefits associated with them, home loans should be paid off after servicing all the other existing debts," observes Vyakaranam.
Though the above-mentioned priority list gives an outline of debt servicing, sometimes you may find an investment which pays you a higher interest rate than the interest rate being paid on the existing debt. As with any financial decision, make sure you analyze the pros and cons of whether to opt for an investment or to pay off the existing loan. Exiting a loan, thus, is an important decision that should be made using the scientific reasoning than the emotional one.

Government aims to kickstart mineral auction by March

("Once the amendments become…)
KOLKATA: The government which is planning to introduce transparent, competitive bidding for all minerals by amending the Mines and Mineral Development and Regulation (MMDR) Act in the current Parliament session, aims to kickstart the first round of auction by March 2015.
"Once the amendments become law, we will begin auction by three months," Secretary in the Ministry of Mines, Anup Kr Pujari , said on the sidelines of CII organised IMME and Global Mining Summit 2014 here today.
Pujari said he was hopeful the amendments would get passed in the current Parliament session unless the same goes to the Standing Committee.
Comments from stakeholders will be accepted for public review of the nine-page draft amendment bill document till December 10.
Pujari said top priority in this amendment is getting an allocation process that has public acceptance.
Pujari said the government is trying to get momentum back in the mining sector and hopes to do it soon.
"We should have a system of allotment which doesn't invite public dissatisfaction. But is it economically the best way is a separate (issue)," he said.
Asked to elaborate, Pujari said any process has its pitfalls but tendering appears to be more appropriate as compared to nomination. The likelihood of getting into legal challenges would be much less "if we go for auction".
He said state governments are yet to send their feedback and comments despite the ministry writing to them.
The draft proposes to introduce a redressal mechanism in which a company can approach the Centre in case the state government has not given an order or decision about any application within 60 days.
Presently, an applicant can approach the Centre for a respite only after the state has given an order on the application.

3-year-old sexually abused inside Bengaluru school twiceComments
A three-year-old girl was allegedly sexually assaulted twice in the premises of a private school in the fifth such incident in as many months.
The accused, a school attendant, was arrested on November 30 after the mother of the victim registered a police complaint, city police commissioner M N Reddi told PTI.
In the complaint filed on November 29, the mother alleged that the child was sexually abused twice on October 22 and November 26, Reddi said.
The attendant has been booked under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act and Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code (relating to punishment for rape).
The latest incident comes weeks after the sexual assault of a six-year-old girl in a school by a Hindi teacher who was arrested. In another incident in October, an office assistant in a school here was arrested for sexual assault of a three-and-a-half-year girl.
An eight-year-old girl was allegedly sexually assaulted by her 63-year-old teacher inside her school premises over a period of time with the offence coming to light in early August, barely a month after the rape of a six-year-old girl at 'Vibgyor High' school.
The series of incidents of sexual assault of minor girls in schools in Bengaluru has led to concerns over safety of children. Police had issued safety guidelines for schools, which in many cases have been found to be observing them in the breach.

Shares in Ceat fell nearly 7 per cent on Wednesday to a day low of Rs 836.40 after new shares allotted to qualified institutional buyers began to trade today.
The company had raised Rs 400 crore through issuing nearly 45 lakh shares to Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs). The issue was opened on November 24 and ended on November 26.
The sudden spurt in free-float shares of the company has led to fall in the share prices, analysts say.
Tyre stocks have witnessed massive buying in recent past on the back of falling crude oil and rubber prices in the international market.
Till Tuesday (December 2) its shares have gained nearly 45 per cent in last three months compared to over 5 per cent gain in the broader Nifty. Analysts say, profit booking by old investors have also led to the fall.
Shares in Ceat ended 5.47 per cent lower at Rs 849 apiece, underperforming the broader Nifty which ended 0.15 per cent higher on Wednesday.

Will maintain gross NPL at current level: Shriram Transport
"I don’t think there will be robust growth for next one-two months. May be in the last quarter January to March there could be some movement in the industrial products," Umesh Revankar, MD, Shriram Transport Finance said.
Post your opinion here
Street Signs
In an interview to CNBC-TV18, Umesh Revankar, MD,  Shriram Transport Finance spoke about the latest happenings in the company and the way ahead. He said that the company is seeing credit demand from semi-rural and rural areas and it saw good disbursements in October.
The company is looking to maintain gross NPL at current levels.
Below is the verbatim transcript of Umesh Revankar’s interview to CNBC-TV18’s Ekta Batra and Anuj Singhal
Ekta: First a word on the credit policy, it is pretty much assumed that the rate cut will be in the first few months of next year but can you give us a sense in terms of what your cost of funds are at this point in time and how do you expect credit growth to pan out in 2015?
A: The cost of funds are reducing especially bond yields have come down and that has an advantage for us in placement of our bonds but the term loan rates have not reduced because bank lending rates have not come down. So it is averaging out to may be around 0.15 to 0.2 percent at this time. Probably when the bank lending rate comes down probably we will have a better advantage.
As far as credit growth is concerned, the credit demand is basically from the rural areas. The urban demand which is mostly dependent on industrial goods and industrial production has not yet picked up in a large scale and none of the infrastructure projects and mining activity also has started. So I don’t think there will be robust growth for next one-two months. May be in the last quarter January to March there could be some movement in the industrial products and that could increase the demand from the urban area. But as far as rural and semi urban areas, the demand is quite consistent.
Ekta: A couple of your interviews a few weeks ago indicated that the festive season was better in terms of disbursements for the company. Can you then give us a sense in terms of whether disbursements would at least pickup for Q3 and whether that momentum has sustained?
A: October looks to be good and we expected that to continue especially there was huge expectation that post Diwali demand will be very consistent on the consumer goods and consumer durables but not much consumption increase was visible. November was not really great for our credit growth but December looks to be little better because the agri goods which were supposed to be moving around November have started moving finally in month of December because of delayed rains and the crop coming into the market has been delayed. I am able to see demand in certain pockets but it is again a semi-urban and rural story, not really on industrial goods or consumer goods.
Anuj: Can you see any kind of delayed impact of the cut in diesel prices? We have seen about Rs 6 cut from peak for diesel prices. Have you started to see any kind of impact from that on demand or would you expect some delayed impact over the next couple of months?
A: Margins are definitely better for the customers. Customers are quite relived to see better margin. If there is a sustained good freight movement then they can enjoy the margin. In certain pockets the freight rates have come down subsequent to diesel price. So it is not that all geographies people are enjoying but some geographies the margins are good, some geographies the freight rates have come down.
Overall I would say the customers, the vehicle operators are relived to see a diesel price cut and some margin improvement. But unless you have a robust freight growth, I don’t think they will be able to employ the vehicle throughout the month and have that better income. So for people to have a better income or better revenue out of the business then moon to buying newer vehicle and more sales, it may take some time.
Ekta: Your gross NPLs were stable in the previous quarter. Would you manage to maintain your gross NPL at that 3.7 percent figure that you delivered in the previous quarter? And two, you have mentioned in articles that you are not interested in a bank license at all, you would prefer to be an NBFC. But would you fit in to may be the small bank license norms that came out?
A: As far as the NPLs are concerned we are quite confident because customer margins are better so we would be able to maintain it in this quarter and next quarter at present level.
As far as banking is concerned we are yet to apply our mind on small bank because we are a large NBFC so how you will be able to adopt to small banks is something which we have not visualised. But as our model is most suitable for the NBFC because we reach to the smallest bottom of the pyramid customer who are operators. We would prefer to be in NBFC line so that our customers are engaged with us.

New Delhi: The opposition parties on Wednesday cornered the Narendra Modi government in Parliament over the controversial statement made by Minister of State Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti. Parties were led by the Trinamool Congress in both the Houses as they demanded Jyoti's resignation for using abusive language.
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu appealed to opposition parties to allow the House to function and said that the minister had already apologised and that if the opposition desired she could read out her statement of regret again.
Congress's Anand Sharma and other opposition leaders, however, refused to relent and insisted on Prime Minister dismissing the minister as she has broken the law and abused the Constitution.
Anand Sharma said, "The law has been broken. The Constitution has been abused. The Prime Minister should dismiss the minister as an apology us not enough."
Niranjan Jyoti had stoked a controversy by saying that all Muslims,
Naidu continued to appeal to opposition parties saying, "We have been patient. The Union Minister has apologised. A Congress leader abused Atal Bihari Vajpayee but that minister was never dropped. TMC'S Tapas Pal had also made a controversial statement. The Opposition should let the House function."
Senior BJP leader LK Advani said MPs should use decent language. "The opposition parties feel it is their duty to stall work in Parliament. We expect all Parliamentarians to use decent language."
Upping the ante against Niranjan Jyoti, BSP and CPI also demanded her resignation.
BSP supremo Mayawati said, "Sadhvi should step down as Union Minister. If she doesn't quit, the Prime Minister should sack her."
CPI leader Sitaram Yechury said, "Sadhvi Jyoti must be removed from her post. She cannot get away with just an apology."

People will soon be able to go to Agra sailing on the Yamuna as the Centre has sought help from the Netherlands government for the ambitious project that includes building barrages and water-terminals on both sides of the river.
"Soon people can go to Agra via Delhi through Yamuna...We will float a Cabinet note within 10 days to specify works for the project by our Ministry and the Delhi Government," Road Transport, Highways and Shipping Minister Nitin Gadkari said.
"We will request Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to ensure special funds for the project," he said.
After chairing a high-level meet to discuss the project, Gadkari said the Netherlands government has agreed to come out with a technical report for the project which includes specifications regarding construction of barrages and two water-terminals at both ends of Yamuna.
"Netherlands has expertise in this in the world. I had a talk with the Netherlands Ambassador. We have asked a Netherlands government agency to prepare the project management report including technical consultancy, to which they have agreed," he said.
Gadkari said barrages would be constructed to ensure at least five metres water in Yamuna round-the-year to ensure passengers and goods transportation through the waterways.
He added that more barrages would be constructed ahead of Wazirabad so that Delhi does not face water-crisis and if need be talks will be held with the Haryana government.
"We have already given nod to seaplanes. We are allowing hovercrafts. We are constructing water-terminals at both the ends of Yamuna on the pattern of airports," he said.
Unveiling the plans, Gadkari said Delhi Development Authority will beautify the riverbanks while the Delhi Jal Board will prevent effluents from being released in Yamuna.
Officials of the Ministry of Shipping in consultation with Delhi Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung will integrate the scheme, he said.
Gadkari said his ministry has accorded highest priority to development of waterways in the country which has been "sadly" ignored so far with the country's goods and passenger transport through the mode barely at 0.5 per cent of the total transport in comparison to China where the percentage was 20 per cent.
The stress is being given on waterways from Varanasi to Kolkata and from Delhi to Agra now in addition to the existing five waterways in the country, he said.

Mercedes Benz C-Class: Features and specsBMW, Mercedes shift gears
Mercedes Benz introduced the new generation W205 or C-Class in India at an ostentatious ceremony in New Delhi. The next-gen sedan was launched at a price tag of Rs 40.90 lacs (ex-showroom Delhi) and is only available in petrol trim for the time being – diesel model will probably arrive early next year.
C-Class has always been a top seller for Mercedes and this new version will carry forward the legacy that started from the very first W201. Having undergone a total of four transformations, it has evolved and now derives its appearance from the S-Class – making it look like a baby S.
Key features and highlights:
Engine, transmissions and dynamics
It is powered by a 2.0 litre Twin Turbo inline four cylinder petrol motor. It delivers a tremendous 181bhp@5500rpm while producing a peak torque of 300Nm at a mere 1200-1400 revs. This motor is mated to a 7G-tronic dual clutch gearbox that seamlessly changes gear and sends the power to the rear wheels.
The engine, transmission and suspension traits could be changed according to the mood of the occupants by a system named AGILITY SELECT. There are 5 settings on offer namely: Comfort, ECO, Sport, Sport+ and Individual. The C-Class can achieve a top speed of 235kmph and accelerates from naught to 100 in just 7.3 seconds. It manages a decent mileage of 14.74kmpl.
Exterior design
Starting from the nose, it gets the signature Mercedes grille on which the Tri-Star badge is tucked on two vertical slats. Flanking the front grill are full LED lights with eyebrow like DRLs that could be observed in some other Mercs too. The understated front bumper goes well with the overstated air gulping scoops it carries. The sides get great lines, one emerging from the headlamps side and runs towards the back while slowly dropping down at the rear wheel. The other is at the bottom and softly rises as it moves to the rear wheel arches. Rear is where it looks the most like an S-Class, though, a little more compact. It is offered in 5 different shades of Cavansite Blue, Obsidian Black, Polar White, Iridium Silver and Citrine Blue. Dimensionally it stands 4686mm long 1810mm wide and 1442mm tall, gets a wheelbase of 2840mm and a turning radius of 5.61mm.
Interior
The cockpit of the new C-Class is derived from Merc’s sport car, AMG GT, and is made to provide maximum comfort rather than a radical look. The dash gets retro A/C louvers and flows towards the rear from the centre in perfect proportions. The central console gets a 17.78cm wide screen that is connected to the infotainment system and the Garmin map pilot. To control this system, a futuristic touchpad is provided well within the reach of the driver on the central bridge. It also gets dual zone THERMATIC automatic climate control while the tri spoke multifunction steering wheel adds to the premiumness. The ambient lighting could be changed between three colors (Polar-ice blue, Solar-Amber and Neutral-white) and 5 intensities. To beat the sun, it gets roller sunblinds in both rear doors. It gets ARTICO leather upholstery that further epitomizes its interiors.
Convenience
To add to driver’s convenience, it gets cruise control with speedtronic variable speed limiter while four way lumbar support for driver and front passenger is also provided. ECO start/stop function, KEYLESS GO starting function and paddle shifters are also there for ease of access. The temperate display provides a lot of info to the occupants of the outside atmosphere. The infotainment system gets Micro-USB drive, iPod dock, iPod lightning connectivity. Moreover, Bluetooth interface with HD-voice capable hands-free function is another smart function of the system.
Safety
C-Class is made very safe from the ground up, its rigid bodyshell is 100 kilos lighter and made more strong by use of hybrid frame construction. The monocoque is crash tested and is able to withstand greater impacts.
On the active front it gets some essential protective traits:

The Bill, proposed in August, aims to lift the cap on foreign investment in insurance ventures from 26 per cent to 49 per cent.
"Insurance companies are now starved of capital and partners are not allowed to put money. Hence, a lot of financial restructuring is going on. If the Insurance bill is passed, it will have a positive impact on the company, particularly the ones where capital is a constraint", said BP Singh, Executive Director & CIO-Equities at Pramerica Mutual Fund.
Among insurance stocks , shares in Max India surged the most by 9 per cent to touch intraday high of Rs 407.80. At 12:53 pm, the stock was trading at Rs 401, up 7.19 per cent.

Brent Rebounds Above $71 in Turbulent Oil Market
Reuters | Updated On: December 03, 2014 15:18 (IST)
Up to 7 No Production Days a Month Till March: Mahindra
London: Brent rose to $71 per barrel on Wednesday, recovering some of its losses from the previous session as a turbulent market searched for a price floor after a nearly 40 per cent fall since June.
Oil has seen choppy trade since the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said last week it would not lower output despite an oversupplied market.
Brent hit a five-year low below $68 a barrel on Monday after averaging around $110 a barrel for the last three years.
"The market's volatility is a result of people working out what's going to happen next," said Jonathan Barratt, chief investment officer at Ayers Alliance Securities.
"Prices should find a volatile low at these levels," he added, arguing oil producers hurt by a drop in revenues may still trim output despite OPEC's formal decision.
Brent for delivery in January rose 62 cents to $71.16 a barrel by 0839 GMT (2:09 p.m. in India) after falling $2 on Tuesday. It was slightly off a day high of $71.46.
US crude for January delivery was at $67.54 a barrel, off the day's high of $67.97, but up 66 cents from the previous session when prices dropped more than $2.
OPEC's oil supply fell by 340,000 barrels per day (bpd) in November as a recovery in Libya faltered, a Reuters survey found, although a lack of deliberate cutbacks by Saudi Arabia and other key members underlines their focus on defending market share.
The Kingdom would only consider cutting production if other countries, including non-OPEC producer Russia, also took part in cuts, former Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki bin Faisal said on Tuesday.
Chart analysts, however, warned that the months-long rout may not be over and US crude could plunge towards $50 per barrel if a handful of tenuous support levels give way after a period of consolidation.
American Petroleum Institute data showing a bigger-than-expected fall in crude stocks in the United States last week provided some support US crude.
The API said crude inventories fell by 6.5 million barrels in the week to Nov. 28 to 373 million, according to API, versus analyst expectations for an increase of 1.3 million barrels. Stocks at the US crude contract's delivery hub of Cushing, Oklahoma, fell 610,000 barrels.
Data from the US Energy Information Administration is due on Wednesday at 1530 GMT (9 p.m. in India).

Private lender Axis Bank is making heavy investments in semi-urban and rural areas in terms of providing infrastructure as these areas offer potential in driving the growth of the business, a top bank official said.
"Besides, the bank would also focus on its unsecured business portfolio including personal loans and doubling up credit card business", Axis Bank President Retail Lending and Payments Jairam Sridharan said.
"Our focus is on unsecured business. Unsecured business is nine per cent of our total retail lending. Total retail lending size is about Rs 90,000 crore", he told reporters.
According to him, the banks' exposure in personal loan portfolio is about Rs 5,000 crore.
On expansion of the bank's business, he said the bank was looking at doubling the size of credit card customers from the existing 1.50 million.
In credit cards business last quarter we crossed 1.50 million.
The monthly spent over credit cards is about Rs 1,000 crore per month.
"I would like the credit card business to double the current size over the next three years", he said.
On tapping the semi-urban and rural areas, he said the bank was making investments heavily in providing infrastructure and in distribution network.
"For example in the past we were offering one or two big products in small towns. But now we are offering all our products. We are offering credit cards to new customers", he said.
Basically, semi-urban and rural branches presence is 52 per cent of our total branches (2,505). This (52 per cent) number used to be 42 per cent in March 2012.
"It already increased and would continue to grow up", he said.

Britain has no rights over Hong Kong:ChinaBy: Press Trust of India | Beijing |
Posted: December 3, 2014 4:49 pm | Updated: December 3, 2014 4:51 pm
China on Wednesday bluntly told Britain to stay out of Hong Kong pro-democracy protests, asserting that the UK no longer has any right to supervision nor any moral obligation after it handed over the former British colony in 1997.
“Following the return of Hong Kong, the British side has no sovereignty, no administrative power and no right of supervision towards Hong Kong and there is no such thing as moral obligation,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told media.
She was replying to allegations from British lawmakers that China’s denial of visas to UK parliamentarians to visit Hong Kong violated the 1984 agreement with Britain for the handover of its former colony.
“Some people from British side attempt to use the so called moral obligation to mislead the public and interfere in China’s domestic affairs,” Hua said adding that “this kind of unacceptable act is doomed to failure.”
“Hong Kong has already returned to China in 1997. It is Special Administrative Region of China. The 1984 joint statement has clearly specified the obligations and rights of China and (the) UK in terms of the resumption of sovereignty towards Hong Kong and the relevant arrangements in the transitional period,” she said.
China has rebuffed Britain by denying visas to a UK lawmakers’ delegation to visit Hong Kong, which is reeling under an almost two-month-long street protests.
The refusal complicates efforts to reset British-China ties that were plunged into difficulties after Cameron met the Dalai Lama at Downing Street in 2012.
The students-led protests erupted initially as street occupations in September against a new rule brought out by China to screen candidates to contest the 2017 elections for the post of Chief Executive in Hong Kong.
Thousands of students blocked key streets demanding the repeal of the rule and implement the promise to hold the universal suffrage without any conditions by Beijing.
Hua’s comments came as three key leaders of the pro-democracy movement surrendered to police on Wednesday.
Benny Tai, Chan Kin-man and Chu Yiu-ming regarded as the founders of Hong Kong’s Occupy Central movement said they turned themselves to the police as they wanted to take responsibility for protests deemed illegal by authorities.
But after a brief meeting they left without being arrested or charged.
The protests reached a dead-end as China refused any talks on the rollback of the rule to vet the candidates and backed the present Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying.
China, which is wary about the protests spreading to other parts, also denied permission to the leaders of the protesting groups to visit Beijing to meet top Chinese leadership.

Snapdeal launches Indias first virtual store for the differentlyabledWritten by Divya A | New Delhi |
Posted: December 3, 2014 4:39 pm | Updated: December 3, 2014 4:58 pm
To mark the International day for people with disability, the country’s first online Rehab and Support store for the differently abled was launched in the Capital. The first-of-its-kind virtual store, from the stable of Snapdeal.com, was inaugurated by Member of Parliament Shashi Tharoor. It aims at providing accessibility to differently abled people for a convenient shopping experience, with more than 1,100 products ranging from wheelchairs to hearing machines and walking sticks. The store will also enable the buyers to compare product specifications and make an informed buying decision.
Tharoor said, “We have all long taken for granted that as long as we can afford to buy something, we can go wherever we want, buy whatever we want. But the differently abled usually do not have that opportunity. For them, it is a struggle to get to a shop, and reach the kind of product they need. With this initiative, the differently abled can now buy products at the click of a mouse.”
Rohit Bansal, Co-founder, Snapdeal.com, added, “Approximately 27 million people in India have a disability and there are barely any services specifically targeted at providing them with access to benefits of India’s technological progress. Through this initiative, we are aiming to provide them access to various support and rehabilitation products. Now, people with different abilities will be able to access these niche products easily sitting in the comforts of their homes for a convenient shopping experience.” The store can be accessed here .

ISRO spy case: Kerala IPS officer moves appeal in HighCourtWritten by Shaju Philip | Thiruvananthapuram |
Posted: December 3, 2014 4:34 pm
Kerala Chief Information Commissioner and former DGP Siby Mathew on Wednesday moved an appeal in the High Court against the recent court order which nullified the government’s decision not to take any action against Mathew and two other former Kerala police officers who probed the ISRO spy case of 1994.
On October 20, this year, a single bench of the High Court had asked the government to review its decision, which according to the court, was a challenge to the judicial system. Former ISRO scientist Namby Narayanan, who had faced spy charges, had moved the court against the Congress government decision in favour of the police officers in 2012.
Mathew moved the appeal after the government made clear that it would not approach the court against the single bench order. Home Minister Ramesh Chennithala had stated that the government has no plan to move an appeal against the single bench verdict.
The family of the late Congress leader K Karunakaran, who has had to quit as Chief Minister in the wake of the ISRO scandal, had asked the government not to go in appeal against the verdict. Karunakaran’s son and senior Congress leader K Muraleedharan had demanded that action be taken against the officers.
In its closure report on the spy case, the CBI had asked the state government to take appropriate action against three officials Siby Mathew IPS, K K Joshwan and S Vijayan.
In 1996, the CBI submitted its closure report in the chief judicial magistrate’s court in Kochi, concluding that the allegations of espionage were unproved and false. The court agreed and all six accused were discharged.
The CBI pointed out lapses by Kerala police officers Mathew, K K Joshwa and S Vijayan, who probed the case. In a report to the Kerala government, it called for “necessary action as deemed fit”.
In June 2012, the Kerala home secretary issued an order saying it was not proper or legal to take action against the officials after 15 years. The government decided no action need be taken.
The CBI had also submitted a report to the Union Home Ministry about the role of some Intelligence Bureau officials, including R Sreekumar.
The CBI report said Mathew had indiscriminately ordered the arrest of the scientists and others without conducting a thorough interrogation or adequately verifying their disclosures.
It said Mathew and his team had not recovered any evidence from the ISRO or the money allegedly paid to the accused by their foreign contacts. “It is unfortunate that he allowed the doubts and suspicions in the mass media and the public mind to linger on without conducting proper verification,” the report said.

I am ready to play a mother now: PallaviKulkarniBy: Press Trust of India | Mumbai |
Posted: December 3, 2014 4:26 pm
Young actress Pallavi Kulkarni, who has made a comeback to TV after seven years with Ekta Kapoor’s ‘Itna Karo Na Mujhe Pyaar’, says she she has no qualms about playing a single mother to five kids.
The 32-year-old actress, who starred in shows like ‘Kehta Hai Dil’ and ‘Vaidehi’, said she is comfortable playing a mature role on screen as she wanted to move on from college romances. The show deals with the relationship challenges between divorced couple, Dr Nachiket Khanna (played by Ronit Roy)and his independent wife Ragini Patel (Pallavi), who become reconnected because of their children.
Pallavi said though she was initially hesitant to play a mother to grown-up children, the offer was too good for her to let go. “I am fully ready to play a mother on screen. In fact I wanted to do a mature character and this show has given me exactly that. I want to do more strong characters now. I wouldn’t mind a love story but the role should have many shades. “I am a mother to a one-and-a half-year-old son and initially I was little hesitant for the character as I did not know if I would look convincing on screen or not but I had full faith in Ekta Kapoor and the role was too good for me to say no because of this reason,” Pallavi told PTI.
The actress, who took a break from acting to enjoy her marital life, said the Sony show is a perfect comeback for her. The actress added being a mother in real life actually helped her better her performance in the show as she could feel for her reel kids. “It is easy to bring out motherly emotions on screen as I have a son. It makes things natural for me and I can relate to how my character would be feeling because this emotion is universal,” she said.
Pallavi, who is having a great time shooting with Ronit, said the duo share a natural chemistry which translates on screen. “He is an amazing person to work with. He is always involved in every aspect of the show. He and Ekta were my biggest reasons to sign the show. The day we met, we clicked instantly. We share a natural chemistry,” she said.

Posted: December 3, 2014 4:21 pm
The new 2015 Porsche Cayenne has been launched in India, nearly two months after it was first showcased for global markets at the 2014 Paris Motor Show in October. The popular SUV from Porsche gets minor styling enhancements inside-out, more features as part of standard equipment and re-worked engines. Four variants of the new Porsche Cayenne will be available : the Cayenne Diesel, the Cayenne S Diesel, Cayenne S and the Cayenne Turbo.
Price
Porsche Cayenne Diesel – Rs. 1.04 crore
Porsche Cayenne S Diesel – Rs. 1.21 crore
Porsche Cayenne S – Rs. 1.19 crore
Porsche Cayenne Turbo – Rs. 1.78 crore
All prices mentioned above are ex-showroom Delhi
“The new Porsche Cayenne embodies the ultimate Porsche traits, class-leading performance and outstanding driveability. No matter the road conditions, the new Cayenne delivers a unique automotive experience and we expect our customers to share in the excitement around this thrilling evolution.” said Anil Reddi, Director, Porsche India during the launch of the SUV here.
The 2015 Porsche Cayenne is essentially a mid-life refresh, the current model was first launched here in 2010. The new Cayenne looks sharper than before, and includes new headlights, bonnet, grille, intakes, tail-lamps and exhausts. Interior design changes are limited to the new three-spoke steering wheel.
The bi-xenon headlights of the new Cayenne get “four-point” LED daytime running lamps which mimic the all-LED headlamps of the 918-hybrid sportscar. The bonnet is not as sculpted as the pre-facelift model, the grille and air-intakes are subtler too. The LED indicators have been moved to the top edge of the air-intakes. The side profile remains the same. The tail-lamps are now more easy on the eyes, they do not look like a bean anymore. The rear looks more elegant thanks to better integrated tail-lamps, boot-handle and license plate. The twin dual-exhausts are now fully enclosed by the rear bumper.
The interior looks pretty much similar as the outgoing model except for the 918-inspired three-spoke steering wheel. The paddle shifters are now part of the standard equipment and are placed behind the steering wheel, the earlier model had push-up-downshift and push-down-for-upshift buttons which were very confusing. Standard equipment on the new Cayenne has been increased; air-suspension with the Porsche active suspension management system, Porsche entry and drive system (keyless entry-and-go) four-zone climate control system, panoramic sunroof, and automatically activated boot-lid now come as standard. Optional extras include rear seat ventilation, soft-close doors, surround camera and a Sports Chrono package for a performance boost.
The powertrains across the range have been given a performance and efficiency boost as compared to the pre-facelift model. Fuel-efficiency has been improved thanks to the inclusion of a coasting function, improved auto start/stop function for the petrol engines and by using active cooling air-flaps.
The Cayenne Diesel is powered by a 3.0-litre V6 engine developing 266PS @ 3,800 continued…

Sunny Leone to reprise Mamta Kulkarni in amovieWritten by Sonal Gera , Edited by Sarika Sharma | New Delhi |
Posted: December 3, 2014 4:20 pm | Updated: December 3, 2014 6:36 pm
Mamta Kulkarni, the diva of the 90s, recently ran into controversy regarding the alleged drug cartel bust in Kenya. The actress is now again in news, as photographer Jayesh Sheth has announced plans of making a film inspired by her.
And according to a report published in mid-day.com , actress Sunny Leone will be seen playing Mamta in the movie.
“Sunny came to my mind as she bears great resemblance to Mamta — a sensuous body with an innocent face. But now it’s too early to say anything, at least till the time I finish writing the script. I have some other names in mind, but Sunny comes closest to Mamta,” says Sheth.
The original script, reportedly, was about a struggling actress, who makes it big and then fades into oblivion. But after the recent reports about the actress, Jayesh Sheth is trying to accommodate certain changes in the climax.
However, Sunny Leone has denied the speculations. The movie is expected to roll by early next year.

ISRO spy case: Kerala IPS officer moves appeal in High CourtWritten by Shaju Philip | Thiruvananthapuram |
Posted: December 3, 2014 4:34 pm
Kerala Chief Information Commissioner and former DGP Siby Mathew on Wednesday moved an appeal in the High Court against the recent court order which nullified the government’s decision not to take any action against Mathew and two other former Kerala police officers who probed the ISRO spy case of 1994.
On October 20, this year, a single bench of the High Court had asked the government to review its decision, which according to the court, was a challenge to the judicial system. Former ISRO scientist Namby Narayanan, who had faced spy charges, had moved the court against the Congress government decision in favour of the police officers in 2012.
Mathew moved the appeal after the government made clear that it would not approach the court against the single bench order. Home Minister Ramesh Chennithala had stated that the government has no plan to move an appeal against the single bench verdict.
The family of the late Congress leader K Karunakaran, who has had to quit as Chief Minister in the wake of the ISRO scandal, had asked the government not to go in appeal against the verdict. Karunakaran’s son and senior Congress leader K Muraleedharan had demanded that action be taken against the officers.

Six-month-old raped in Gujarat s Patan districtBy: Press Trust of India | Ahmedabad |
Posted: December 3, 2014 4:06 pm
In a gruesome act, a six-month-old girl was allegedly raped by a man– acquainted to the victim’s family– in Gujarat’s Patan district, police said on Wednesday.
The rape took place late last night and the accused is on the run, while the toddler is being treated at Dharpur civil hospital in Chanasma and is critical at the moment, police said.
“The man raped the six-month-old at her residence in Itoda village in Chanasma tehsil of the district,” said Police Sub Inspector (PSI) of Chansama police station D D Chaudhari.
The accused, identified as Bhavanji Thakor (32), was known to the victim’s family, Chaudhari said.
The incident occured when the victim’s parents had gone out for a religious programme in the outskirts of the village with their two daughters, he said.
The family had handed over their younger daughter to the accused to take care of her. However, when the family returned home, the accused left the place in hurry and the toddler was found bitterly crying, he said.
When the mother checked her daughter, she found her daughter bleeding and doubted that she was raped by Thakor, Chaudhari said adding that the victim’s family immediately went to Thakor’s place where the accused also threatened them with dire consequences if they would ever reveal about the rape, Chaudhari said.
The police has filed a FIR on complaint of the victim’s family and charged the accused under Indian Penal Code (IPC) section 376 (rape) along with section 3(a)(forcible penetration to a child) and section 4, which attracts punishment of not less than seven years, Chaudhari said.

Govt s infra boost: India eases FDI rules for construction sectorCentre formalises easier FDI rules for construction

(Under the new rules, foreign…)
NEW DELHI: India has liberalised foreign direct investment rules in the construction sector, formalising a decision taken by the Cabinet in October to attract foreign capital and give a fillip to the cash-starved industry.
According to a Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion Press Note, which makes the new rules formal, the conditions related to built-up area and minimum capitalisation have been relaxed for projects where overseas investors can put in money. The new rules also make it easier for foreign investors to exit projects.
A foreign investor will now be allowed to exit after either the project's completion or the development of trunk infrastructure such as roads, water supply, street lighting, drainage and sewerage. If an investor wants to leave the project earlier, he can transfer the stake to another foreign investor after getting approval from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, which vets overseas investments.
The Union Cabinet had allowed to reduce the minimum floor area of projects to 20,000 sq metres from the earlier 50,000 sq metres for getting FDI.
It had also halved the minimum capital requirement of projects where FDI is allowed to $5 million.
In the case of joint venture projects with an Indian partner, it had cut the minimum capital requirement is $2.5 million from $5 million previously. However, experts say the government must clarify if the new changes will apply to existing projects where investment has already come in.
"What the Press Note does not answer is treatment of existing investments in construction development sector which were made under the erstwhile policy," said Akash Gupt, partner, regulatory services, at PricewaterhouseCoopers. "If the investment has been made with a commercial understanding with the Indian partner to exit post three years, will that now be locked-in till completion of the project?"
Most housing projects have been running one to two years or even more behind schedule because of an economic slowdown and shortage of funds on account of elevated debt levels.
The new rules also drop the condition of minimum land of 10 hectares.
"This will aid the market in attracting more investments, especially helping in addressing housing shortage within the country. The easier exit on the other hand will ensure faster delivery of projects, reducing cost and time overruns by development firms," said Sachin Sandhir, global managing director for emerging business and MD South Asia at Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
In what could drive affordable housing in the country, developers will be exempt from restrictions in size, minimum capitalisation and exit if they commit 30% of project cost to affordable housing.
Looking to boost construction of hotels , tourist resorts, hospitals, special economic zones, educational institutions, old-age homes and investments by non-resident Indians, the government has given free access to investors in these segments.The new rules will also give a boost to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of creating 100 smart cities by 2020 that will provide modern amenities, education and employment opportunities.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had allocated Rs 7,060 crore in the Budget for 2014-15 for this purpose.
The construction sector attracted $1.2 billion in FDI in 2013-14, down 8% from 2012-13. Between April and August this fiscal year, the sector received investments worth $446 million.Based on the new rules, at least 50% of each project must be developed within a period of five years from the date of obtaining all mandatory clearances. Investors wouldn't be allowed to sell underdeveloped plots.

Sailing to Agra on Yamuna soon: Gadkari | Don t want to privatise rly ops  says PrabhuArun Jaitley
(People will soon be able…)
NEW DELHI: People will soon be able to go to Agra sailing on the Yamuna as the Centre has sought help from the Netherlands government for the ambitious project that includes building barrages and water-terminals on both sides of the river.
"Soon people can go to Agra via Delhi through Yamuna...We will float a Cabinet note within 10 days to specify works for the project by our Ministry and the Delhi Government," Road Transport, Highways and Shipping Minister Nitin Gadkari said.
"We will request Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to ensure special funds for the project," he said.
After chairing a high-level meet to discuss the project, Gadkari said the Netherlands government has agreed to come out with a technical report for the project which includes specifications regarding construction of barrages and two water-terminals at both ends of Yamuna.
"Netherlands has expertise in this in the world. I had a talk with the Netherlands Ambassador. We have asked a Netherlands government agency to prepare the project management report including technical consultancy, for which they have agreed," he said.
Gadkari said barrages would be constructed to ensure at least five metres water in Yamuna round-the-year to ensure passengers and goods transportation through the waterways.
He added that more barrages would be constructed ahead of Wazirabad so that Delhi does not face water-crisis and if need be talks will be held with the Haryana government.
"We have already given nod to seaplanes. We are allowing hovercrafts. We are constructing water-terminals at both the ends of Yamuna on the pattern of airports," he said.
Unveiling the plans, Gadkari said Delhi Development Authority will beautify the riverbanks while the Delhi Jal Board will prevent effluents from being released in Yamuna.
Officials of the Ministry of Shipping in consultation with Delhi Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung will integrate the scheme, he said.
Gadkari said his ministry has accorded highest priority to development of waterways in the country which has been "sadly" ignored so far with the country's goods and passenger transport through the mode barely at 0.5 per cent of the total transport in comparison to China where the percentage was 20 per cent.
The stress is being given on waterways from Varanasi to Kolkata and from Delhi to Agra now in addition to the existing five waterways in the country, he said.

NEW DELHI: Close on the heels of German being replaced with Sanskrit as third language in KVs, the Government today said all central universities have been asked to explore the possibilities of opening of Sanskrit department.
"In order to promote Sanskrit language, the Central Government has requested all central universities, where department of Sanskrit does not exist, to explore the possibilities of opening of Sanskrit departments," HRD Minister Smriti Irani told the Lok Sabha.
Irani said in a written reply to a question by Shivkumar Udasi of BJP on whether the government was emphasising upon establishment of centres for teaching and learning of Sanskrit, Chinese, Russian, Urdu and European languages by providing specific financial assistance.
The Minister said UGC was also providing plan and non-plan grants to five Sanskrit universities and two Sanskrit deemed-to-be-universities.
Irani's recent decision to replace German with Sanskrit as the third language in Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) has courted controversy, though she has insisted that German was being taught in violation of the National Policy of Education and the Three Language Formula.
The Supreme Court had, however, on November 28 asked the Centre to consider not replacing German language with Sanskrit in KVs in the middle of the ongoing academic session and implement the decision from next academic year.

Stricter penalties in Electricity (Amendmen...Piyush Goyal
(Goyal said that govt will…)
NEW DELHI: The Power Ministry is working on incorporating stricter penalties in the proposed Electricity (Amendment) Act and hopes to introduce it in the ongoing winter session of Parliament.
"We are looking at amendments to the Electricity Act of 2003, which we hope to present to Parliament during this session ... we are strengthening the penalty provisions, making it more stringent, more enforceable, increasing the penalty many-fold," Power Minister Piyush Goyal said here today.
He said that the current renewable purchase obligation (RPO) is also being re-looked.
"Earlier, we had certain set of targets till 2022, which we are bringing forward to 2019, we hope that 15 per cent of the renewable power purchase obligation can be enforced to 2015," he said.
RPO (renewable purchase obligation) means the requirement specified by the electricity regulatory commission for the obligated entity to purchase electricity from renewable energy sources.
The minister added that the government will also introduce a new element as RGO or renewable generation obligation.
"We will soon have companies which are setting up new projects required to also have 10 per cent renewable component, RGO to be introduced in the new act," Goyal said here at the launch of Indian Wind Energy Alliance (IWEA), a body for wind energy industry.
He said that the government will provide all the necessary support to the wind energy industry to achieve the target of 10,000 MW of wind power installations every year.
Sumant Sinha , Chairman of IWEA and Chairman and CEO of ReNew Power said that the wind power industry needs three things from the government -- ensuring sufficient demand, making it attractive for the states and removing installation bottlenecks.
Sinha, the Chairman and CEO of ReNew Power, said that his company has 500 MW of installed and operational wind projects and it plans to double the number in the next 12-15 months.
He also said that the current RPO mechanism which is a guideline by the government should be made mandatory to give further filip to the sector.
Madhusudan Khemka, MD of ReGen Powertech Private Ltd said, since solar and wind can go hand in hand the government should encourage more hybrid projects.
"The wind-solar hybrid will make it more viable," he said adding that solar will benefit during the day and wind during the night thereby giving economies of scale.
Khemka said that the industry is currently engaged in talks with the electricity regulator CERC for the same.

RBI doubles pre-paid card limit to Rs 1 lakhGift cards
(The maximum validity of…)
MUMBAI: Relaxing norms for Pre-paid Payment Instruments (PPI), the Reserve Bank today doubled the card limit to Rs 1 lakh.
"The limit of PPI... has now been enhanced from Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh. The balance in the PPI should not exceed Rs 1 lakh at any point of time," RBI said in a statement.
The move would help in achieving the objective of limiting cash transactions in the system.
Besides, the maximum validity of gift cards has been enhanced from one year to three years, it said, adding that other provisions of PPI guidelines with respect to gift cards will continue to be applicable.
RBI also allowed issue of multiple PPIs by banks from fully-KYC compliant bank accounts for dependent or family members, it said.
Only one card can be issued to one beneficiary, it said. "The bank may put in place mechanisms to monitor and report suspicious transactions on these PPIs to Financial Intelligence Unit India (FIU IND)," it added.
Based on a comprehensive internal review and feedback received from entities currently authorised to issue PPIs, it has been considered necessary to amend certain provisions of existing guidelines for ensuring growth of prepaid payment industry, it said.
The central bank also permitted banks to issue rupee denominated PPIs for visiting foreign nationals and NRIs.
"Banks are permitted to issue open system rupee denominated non-reloadable PPIs to NRIs and foreign nationals visiting India and PPIs co-branded with exchange houses/money transmitters (approved by RBI) to NRIs and foreign nationals visiting India," it said.
However, this would be subject to certain conditions like the cards can be issued by overseas branches of banks in India directly or by co-branding with the exchange houses/money transmitters up to a maximum amount of Rs 2 lakh by loading from a KYC compliant bank account.
Such PPIs should be activated by the bank only after the traveller arrives in India and cash withdrawal will be restricted to Rs 50,000 per month.
The cards should be issued strictly for use in India and transactions settled in Indian rupee, it added.

Black money: Court to hear Burman s case on ...Black Money
(A Delhi court today fixed…)
NEW DELHI: A Delhi court today fixed January 27 for recording of pre-charge evidence in two alleged tax evasion cases involving Pradip Burman , one of Dabur India promoters whose name has figured in the list given by the Centre to the Supreme Court in the black money issue.
The matter was fixed for January 27, 2015 as Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Devender Kumar Sharma, who had earlier granted bail to Burman, was on half-day leave.
The court was scheduled to record pre-charge evidence in the cases from today and testimony of complainant and income tax officer Gaurav Dudeja is likely to be recorded first.
Burman was not present in the court today as he sought exemption from personal appearance for the day.
The court had earlier granted bail to Burman but barred him from leaving the country.
The court had directed that he will not leave the country without its prior permission after the Income Tax (IT) department argued that there was a likelihood that accused may leave the country to avoid his prosecution in the case.
According to IT department's complaint, Burman was holding foreign bank accounts but he did not disclose about it in his income tax returns and there were undisclosed deposits in those two accounts.
Advocate Brijesh Garg, appearing for IT department, said when Burman was questioned, he denied having any account in foreign bank but later on, when he was confronted with several documents, he allegedly admitted having bank accounts abroad.
Two separate cases were lodged against Burman under the IT Act for the offences relating to concealment of income and tax evasion. The cases relates to assessment years 2006-07 and 2007-08.
The court, after taking cognisance of the complaint by the IT department, had summoned Burman as accused in the cases.
Burman had earlier appeared in the court in pursuance to summons issued against him.
Burman's counsel had earlier sought bail on the ground that they were complaint cases and his client was ready to abide by any terms and conditions imposed by the court.
IT department's counsel Garg has submitted that the complaint was filed against Burman for evasion of tax and for furnishing false information/verification.
"The present case is out of several cases in respect to black money for which investigation is going on by the and under the supervision of Special Investigation Team (SIT) constituted by the Supreme Court of India," Garg had said.
The Centre on October 27 has disclosed before the apex court eight more names including that of Burman, a bullion trader and Goa miners against whom it has started prosecution for allegedly stashing black money in foreign banks.
Rajkot-based bullion trader Pankaj Chimanlal Lodhya and Goa-based mining company Timblo Private Limited and its five directors were among the names that figured in the list which was filed in the Supreme Court by the government.
While Burman's name was received from French authorities, the names of Lodhia and others have been received from "other countries".
Shortly after the disclosure in the Supreme Court, Dabur India promoter family, Burmans had said the account complied with all legal requirements.
"We wish to state that this account was opened when he (Pradip) was an NRI, and was legally allowed to open this account," a Dabur spokesperson had said in a statement.

The disinvestment of 5 per cent stake in state-run Steel Authority of India is likely to happen on December 5 (Friday), says ET Now quoting sources.
This would be the government's first disinvestment in the current financial year (FY15).
The stock took a tumble on the Street after the news came in. It slipped as much as 5.09 per cent.
At 3:09 pm, the stock was trading at Rs 85.50; down 4.84 per cent.
The sale of 5 per cent stake, or about 20.65 crore shares , of the steel maker at the current market price of Rs 85.45 apiece would fetch the exchequer around Rs 1,764.54 crore.
Domestic roadshows for the issue were held in Mumbai and Chennai in September. Two teams were sent to meet overseas investors. While one visited London, New York and Boston, the other solicited participation of investors based in Singapore and Hong Kong.
Apart from SAIL , Coal India , NHPC , PFC and REC are on the block among others. The government has been using the OFS route for disinvestment of PSUs.
The Cabinet had in July 2012 approved a 10.82 per cent stake sale in the country's largest steel maker. Accordingly, the first tranche of disinvestment of 5.82 per cent was done in March 2013.
Retail investors would be offered an additional incentive of an increased investment quota as well as discount to the issue price, which would be announced a day before the OFS. The government might announce the issue date two days prior to the OFS.
Market regulator Sebi had in January, 2013 permitted the promoters of top 100 companies to use the auction route or OFS route to dilute stake in listed companies. It also permitted OFS in those PSUs which were to meet the minimum 25 per cent public holding norm.

The S&P BSE Sensex closed 1.3 points lower at 28442.71. It hit a low of 28370.73 and a high of 28504.65 in trade today.

However, stock specific move especially in midcap and smallcap space provided ample trading opportunities and kept the participants busy," says Jayant Manglik, President-retail distribution, Religare Securities Limited.
Sentiments got some support as the HSBC services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to five-month high at 52.6 in the month of November from 50 in October.
"Further, the positive effect continued for the second successive day especially in the rate sensitive sectors in response to the RBI Governor's statement that a rate cut was likely early next year if the inflation momentum continues to follow downward path," adds Manglik.
We believe the Nifty index would consolidate further in the coming days but the overall bias would remain on the positive side till the Nifty index is upholding above 8350 mark. So, any decline can be considered to accumulate index majors and quality midcap stocks."

Minister Jyoti will not quit over hate speech  government tells opposition partiesJyoti won't resign over hate speech, govt to Oppn

An adamant and united opposition Wednesday continued to disrupt both Houses of Parliament demanding Union minister Niranjan Jyoti be sacked over her hate speech even though the government ruled out her resignation.
Opposition MPs refused to treat the matter as closed and forced repeated adjournments of both Houses demanding an explanation from Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
In Rajya Sabha, parliamentary affairs minister M Venkaiah Naidu rejected their demands citing controversial remarks made in the past by leaders from other parties as well.
"There is no question of resignation of minister Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti," said Naidu.
Opposition leaders asked the Prime Minister, who was present in Lok Sabha, to explain why the union minister had not been fired despite her hate speech.
Chaos in Lok Sabha
As soon as Lok Sabha took up Question Hour, leader of Congress Mallikarjun Kharge said in apparent sarcasm that it is a privilege that the Prime Minister is present in the House.
He said since the Prime Minister was himself present in the House, he was insisting on the resignation of Jyoti from the council of ministers for her controversial remarks.
Reacting to Kharge's taunt, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) members retorted saying Modi has been attending parliamentary proceedings.
Soon, Congress members, joined by Trinamool Congress and MPs from other opposition parties, trooped into the Well demanding a reply from the PM. They also demanded her resignation and lodging of an FIR against the Union minister.
Speaker Sumitra Mahajan said if records are checked then most of the members would be found having made controversial remarks in their public life.
BJP's women MPs too criticised the opposition for repeatedly disrupting Parliament over the incident saying they were doing so as they had run out of issues.
"Congress and TMC created a scene. To oppose it we also stood on our feet. The sad thing is when the NDA government's minister has apologised, then raising the same issue again for the second day, we condemn it," BJP MP Poonam Mahajan said.
Mahajan, who was accompanied by a group of women MPs of her party, said that members wanted to raise issues related to development of their constituencies but the opposition was not allowing proceedings in the Question Hour or Zero Hour by disrupting Parliament.
She claimed the opposition parties like Congress and TMC just wanted to create a scene before the Prime Minister.
"They don't have issues and they don't have a leader. That is why they have done it," Mahajan said.
Normality was restored in the Lok Sabha in the afternoon after members of the Congress, Trinamool and Left staged a walkout. The House managed to pass the School of Planning and Architecture Bill and took up the Repealing and Amending (Second) Bill, 2014.
Similar scenes in Rajya Sabha
BJP members engaged in angry exchange of words with those in the Opposition as the government appeared toughening its stand on the issue with a number of ministers countering the demand.
Members from Congress, SP and JD (U) trooped into the Well while those from CPI-M, CPI and Trinamool Congress were on their feet rejecting the government's argument that the matter should be treated as closed since the minister has already expressed regret.
The House was adjourned four times in the pre-lunch session because of the pandemonium.
Soon after Rajya Sabha Chairman Hamid Ansari took up obituary references after the House met for the day, Opposition members were on their feet demanding action against the minister.
Renewing his demand for passing a condemnation resolution by the House, Naresh Agrawal (SP) said, "This House does not have faith in the minister and demands that she be sacked."
Deputy leader of Congress Anand Sharma said the remarks made by the minister is "not only a cognisable but also compoundable offence" under section 153(A) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and demanded that the Prime Minister should come to the House and inform it that the minister has been sacked.
Section 153(A) of the IPC deals with the offence of promoting enmity between different groups on ground of religion, race, place of birth, residence and language and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony.
"We are not seeking any apology. The minister should be sacked. This is an insult to the Constitution. The Prime Minister should inform the House that the minister has been sacked," Sharma said.
Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Sitaram Yechury resented that Opposition members were not given a chance to seek clarifications on the minister's statement "against the norms of the House".
Sharad Yadav of Janata Dal (United) said if the Prime Minister, who has appointed Jyoti a minister takes action against her, it will send a signal and others will not make such remarks in future.
As Sharma kept insisting that what the minister said constituted of a criminal offence that could fetch an imprisonment of up to three years, members from the treasury benches told him to "go to the court".
When Kurien called a member from the ruling BJP to speak on the issue, Opposition members resented it and trooped into the Well.
There were two adjournments in the Zero Hour.
Similar scenes were witnessed during the Question Hour also.
As Chairman Hamid Ansari took up the first question of the day, Congress members came into the Well shouting slogans. SP and JD-U members also joined them.
Ansari's request to allow the Question Hour to proceed went in vain and amid din, he adjourned the House for 15 minutes.
When the House reassembled, Opposition members resumed their protest and the House was adjourned till 2pm.
But the Rajya Sabha witnessed a washout as it was adjourned for the day. Later in the evening, a Delhi high court lawyer filed a complaint against the minister at Tilak Nagar police station for her hate speech. Additional DCP (West) Monika Bharadwaj said no case was registered.
Jyoti, minister of state for food processing industries, had apologised in Parliament on Tuesday, reportedly on the orders of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but opposition parties like the Left want her sacked and say she must face criminal charges for trying to incite communal hatred.
Addressing a meeting of the BJP parliamentary board, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also asked party MPs to be cautious when making comments in public.
The government, had earlier said that the matter was closed with the minister expressing regret. But, Congress members indicated that they intended to press the issue in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday.
Niranjan Jyoti had reportedly had said at a public meeting in Delhi on Monday, "The people of Delhi have to decide if they want a government of Ramzaadon (descendants of Ram) or haramzaadon (those who are illegitimately born)."

Modi govt embarrasses Amit Shah  says no Saradha-Burdwan linkGovt contradicts Amit Shah on Burdwan blast
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, December 03, 2014

Comments
The government Wednesday contradicted Bharatiya Janata Party chief Amit Shah's allegation that money from Saradha chit fund was used in the October 2 blast in West Bengal's Burdwan saying the probe has so far not revealed any connection.
Jitendra Singh, minister of state in the prime minister's office, in a written reply in Rajya Sabha said there was "no link". The minister also clarified there was no evidence yet that money from the scam was sent to Bangladesh.
"The investigation has so far not revealed any such transaction where money was routed to Bangladesh to fund terrorist activities," Singh told the House.
 
Shah, while speaking in Kolkata on Sunday, had alleged that Mamata Banerjee's government and her party, Trinamool Congress, were
shielding the accused in the Saradha scam.
"Saradha chit fund money was used in the Burdwan blast. The NIA is not being allowed to probe the blast properly. Hurdles are being
created. It is being done in order to save TMC leaders who are involved in the blast," Shah had alleged, attacking the Trinamool Congress.
 
The minister was asked whether the government has sought details of the probe into the Saradha chit fund scam after reports indicated that a part of the money was routed to Bangladesh to fund terror activities. Singh replied that government has not sought details of the
probe.
 
To another question on whether the Saradha chief has admitted that he paid large sums to several people to influence the case in his
favour, Singh said "the matter is under investigation."
As the Opposition, especially the Trinamool attacked Shah, Union minister Babul Supriyo, elected on BJP ticket from West Bengal, expressed surprise over Singh's statement and alleged that the ruling party in Bengal and its MPs had links with terror plot in Bangladesh.
"I came to know about Jitendra Singh's statement a little while back. There is a different reason. There were a lot of responsible minds who acted very fast to ensure that the state government has evidence, proofs and it has been recorded in front of several TV cameras," Supriyo told reporters outside Parliament.
"The state government was instrumental in destroying evidence that could prove state government's, TMC's or their MPs' connection with the terror plot that is not only West Bengal centric but also finds its way into Bangladesh and neighbouring countries," he said.
"So it was very smart of the central government to get NIA into the act. NIA is right now doing a very comprehensive research into the entire act. I got to know what Jitendra Singh said a while ago. I need to find out why he said so."
On October 2, a blast in a house in the Khagragarh area of Burdwan in West Bengal killed two people and critically injured a third person.
Investigators suspect people who were living in the house belong to a Bangladeshi militant organisation known as the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh.

Clarke s tearful farewell to Phillip Hughes: See you out in the middleClarke's bids tearful farewell to Phillip Hughes

Australia captain Michael Clarke urged mourners to "dig in and get through to tea" as he choked back tears in an emotional eulogy for Phillip Hughes at the cricketer's funeral on Wednesday.
A near-constant presence at Hughes's bedside during his two-day fight for life, Clarke sucked back deep breaths at Macksville High School hall during the tribute to his "little brother's" spirit.
"Oh, he would definitely be calling me a sook (crybaby) right now, that's for sure," Clarke began, gasping for air in the stifling hot room packed with 1,000 people.
"I don't know about you, but I keep looking for him. I know it is crazy but I expect any minute to take a call from him or to see his face pop around the corner.
"Is this what we call the spirit? If so, then his spirit is still with me. And I hope it never leaves."
Hughes died last Thursday at the age of 25, two days after being rushed to hospital for emergency surgery, having been struck by a rising delivery during a domestic match at the Sydney Cricket Ground.
Clarke joined fellow cricketers and Hughes's father and brother among the pallbearers in delivering the coffin to the hearse before it set off in procession through the cricketer's hometown of Macksville, New South Wales.
The 33-year-old skipper spoke of his visit to the SCG wicket on the night of Hughes's death.
"I knelt down and touched the grass, I swear he was with me," said Clarke, who had helped usher Hughes into Australia's state ranks then the national team.
"Picking me up off my feet to check if I was okay. Telling me we just needed to dig in and get through to tea.
"Telling me off for that loose shot I played. Chatting about what movie we might watch that night. And then passing on a useless fact about cows.
"And I could see him swagger back to the other end, grin at the bowler, and call me through for a run with such a booming voice, a bloke in the car park would hear it.
"Is this what indigenous Australians believe about a person's spirit being connected with the land upon which they walk? If so, I know they are right about the SCG. His spirit has touched it and it will forever be a sacred ground for me."
Clarke said Hughes's death would strengthen the bonds of cricket around the world.
"Phillip's spirit, which is now part of our game forever, will act as a custodian of the sport we all love. We must listen to it. We must cherish it. We must learn from it," he added.
"We must dig in," Clarke faltered, crying.
"We must dig in and get through to tea. And we must play on.
"So rest in peace, my little brother. I will see you out in the middle."

RBI Doubles Pre-Paid Card Limit to Rs 1 LakhSalaries in India Likely to Rise by 10.5% in 2015: Report
Mumbai: Relaxing norms for pre-paid payment instruments (PPI), the Reserve Bank of India on Wednesday doubled the card limit to Rs 1 lakh.
"The limit of PPI... has now been enhanced from Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh. The balance in the PPI should not exceed Rs 1 lakh at any point of time," the RBI said in a statement.
The move would help in achieving the objective of limiting cash transactions in the system.
Besides, the maximum validity of gift cards has been enhanced from one year to three years, it said, adding that other provisions of PPI guidelines with respect to gift cards will continue to be applicable.
The RBI also allowed issue of multiple PPIs by banks from fully-KYC compliant bank accounts for dependent or family members, it said.
Only one card can be issued to one beneficiary, it said.
"The bank may put in place mechanisms to monitor and report suspicious transactions on these PPIs to Financial Intelligence Unit India (FIU IND)," it added.
Based on a comprehensive internal review and feedback received from entities currently authorised to issue PPIs, it has been considered necessary to amend certain provisions of existing guidelines for ensuring growth of prepaid payment industry, it said.
The apex bank also permitted banks to issue rupee denominated PPIs for visiting foreign nationals and NRIs.
"Banks are permitted to issue open system rupee denominated non-reloadable PPIs to NRIs and foreign nationals visiting India and PPIs co-branded with exchange houses/money transmitters (approved by RBI) to NRIs and foreign nationals visiting India," it said.
However, this would be subject to certain conditions like the cards can be issued by overseas branches of banks in India directly or by co-branding with the exchange houses/money transmitters up to a maximum amount of Rs 2 lakh by loading from a KYC compliant bank account.
Such PPIs should be activated by the bank only after the traveller arrives in India and cash withdrawal will be restricted to Rs 50,000 per month.
The cards should be issued strictly for use in India and transactions settled in Indian rupee, it added.

Fall in rubber prices: Kerala to take up issue with Centre
Chandy said further fall in price of rubber would not only adversely affect farmers, but also the state's economy. It would also ultimately hit tyre manufactures in the country, as production would fall with farmers shifting to other crops, he pointed out.

Fall in rubber prices: Kerala to take up issue with Centre

The Kerala government today said it would take up with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the financial crisis faced by rubber farmers in the state following sharp fall in its price.
Replying to a calling attention motion to the need to redress the serious problems of rubber growers, Chief Minister Oommen Chandy informed the Assembly that government would demand a curb on import or hike in the import duty of rubber.
He said the issue would be brought to the notice of the PM when a state delegation meets him soon to apprise him of the state's concern on the Mullaperiyar issue. The delegation will include opposition leader V S Achuthanandan.
Chandy said further fall in price of rubber would not only adversely affect farmers, but also the state's economy. It would also ultimately hit tyre manufactures in the country, as production would fall with farmers shifting to other crops, he pointed out.
"So it is the responsibility of all to ensure reasonable price to rubber for farmers", Chandy said.
The Chief Minister said government had already held one round of discussions with Rubber Board Officials to find a solution to the problem.
He said Kerala would give its recommendation to the Centre to incorporate in the new National Rubber policy a demand for financial package for rubber tree replantation.
Chandy said rubber procurement initiated by state government had failed to make any impact on the market.
 

LED will start eating mkt share of CFL: Bajaj Electricals01:30 pm
All government offices and municipal corporation are likely to have LED lights. Speaking to CNBC-TV18 about this development, Shekhar Bajaj, CMD,  Bajaj Electricals said that the government is also mulling replacing street lights with LED lights. Though the business contribution of LED segment to the company’s financials is low at the moment, Bajaj is confident that LED will start eating into market share of CFL.
Below is the verbatom transcript of Shekhar Bajaj’s interview to CNBC-TV18’s Nigel D'Souza and Ekta Batra
Ekta: Have you all heard something on the lines of the fact that LED lights might be used in government offices and if it is, how much of an opportunity would it be for a company like Bajaj Electricals?
A: This is going on for some time and in the Light international exhibition which took place few months back also there were talks going on about all the street lights, leave aside the government, even the street lighting all over the country where a lot of light has been used should slowly get into LED.
The LED advantage is that it is 90 percent saving compared to a normal bulb. Also against 1000 hrs a normal lamp it has got 15000 hours life therefore because of that even though the costs are continuously coming down, if a person buys it today instead of buying it after sometime when the cost will be lower, the energy saving that takes place today itself will justify even though tomorrow instead of costing Rs 300, you may get it for Rs 200 after couple of years but he will be saving more than that energy. So a person should not postpone purchase of an LED product.
The government offices as well as all street lights are using a lot of energy. Today about 17 percent of the total energy produced is used for lighting whereas all over the world it is only about 10 percent. Therefore this is the biggest advantage as I see if we can save 3-4 percent we will be much better off.
Nigel: Lighting contributes nearly around 20-30 percent of your total revenues so how much of it is from the LED segment?
A: Our LED share is very low and that is why our performance in the lighting segment has not been great. Suppose this year we will do about Rs 600 crore turnover, I don’t think in that LED will be more than Rs 40-50 crore, I don’t remember the number but it will be very low.
Nigel: You were telling us that your CFL business has been struggling over the last couple of quarters. Will this put further pressure on that business?
A: The pressure is on because the cost is getting competitive and therefore over a period LED will start taking market share of CFL. That is why there is no growth in CFLs. When CFL came, GLS started getting impacted, similarly LED is going to impact CFL and GLS over a period because it is something that once you put it, you forget it for next two-three years, there is no issue at all.
Bajaj Electric stock price
On December 10, 2014, Bajaj Electricals closed at Rs 213.10, down Rs 8.6, or 3.88 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 384.80 and the 52-week low was Rs 174.00.
The company's trailing 12-month (TTM) EPS was at Rs 0.08 per share as per the quarter ended September 2014. The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was 2663.75. The latest book value of the company is Rs 70.43 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company is 3.03.

India has received its biggest shipment of liquefied natural gas (LNG) by ship as it looks to diversify supplies and economise parcel size to meet growing energy demand. A Q-Max LNG vessel, the largest LNG carrier in its class, with a capacity of about 261,000 cubic meters, was received at Petronet LNG Ltd's Dahej import terminal in Gujarat yesterday. The receipt of the ship, carrying cargo from Ras-Laffan, Qatar, has set another benchmark, the company said in a statement.
Last year, Petronet had successfully unloaded 1,000th cargo at Dahej in a short span of about 9 years. "We are glad to receive first Q-Max LNG vessel, one of the biggest size LNG ships available today, at Dahej Terminal and expect to receive more such cargoes in future," Petronet Managing Director & CEO Ashok Kumar Balyan said. In April, Petronet had signed a short-term contract with Qatar's Ras Laffan Liquefied Natural Gas Co to import 800,000 tonnes of LNG over 12 months to supply to refineries.
Petronet currently imports 7.5 million tonnes a year of LNG from RasGas on a long-term contract that was signed in 2004. "The global energy supplier currently makes regular deliveries to Petronet's Dahej and Kochi terminals. After South Korea, India is RasGas' largest recipient of LNG by volume," the statement said. RasGas will load its 1,000th cargo destined to Dahej in mid-December.
"The safe berthing and unloading of the Mekaines Q-Max vessel at Dahej is another significant milestone to highlight relationship between RasGas and Petronet. "As the largest single supplier of LNG to India, RasGas stands ready to assist Petronet in meeting India's growing demand for eco-friendly fuel. "The delivery of the Q-Max cargo to Dahej Terminal demonstrates our flexibility in meeting our long-standing customer's needs," said Khalid Sultan R. Al Kuwari, RasGas' Chief Marketing and Shipping Officer.
Petronet currently has two operational LNG import terminals - 10 million tonnes a year Dahej facility in Gujarat and 5 million tonnes per annum facility at Kochi in Kerala. The firm, which meets about 30 per cent of the country's gas demand, has so far sourced over 1,250 cargoes at its Dahej LNG terminal.
"The Dahej terminal is further being expanded to 15 million tonnes capacity. In September, 2013, Petronet has commissioned its 5 million tonnes LNG terminal at Kochi. "Petronet is also pursuing setting up of its third terminal at Gangavaram on the East Coast of India," the statement added.

New Delhi: Land Acquisition Bill, which was to be tabled in the Winter Session of Parliament, could face further delay. Sources on Wednesday suggested the governmnet had dropped plans to table amendments in the Land Acquisition Bill in Parliament as it needs more time to get the opposition parties on board.

Earlier, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said that the government would go ahead with amendments to the Land Acquisition Bill even if the opposition did not support it.
The government claims to need more time to build consensus on simplifying the land acquisition process.

"Some changes may be necessary (to the land laws). We will first try to reach a consensus and if that is not possible we will go ahead and take the decision," he had said at the India Global Forum meeting.
The debate is ongoing as many states have come out openly against the new Land Acquisition Bill, complaining that it hurt the process of acquiring land for infrastructure projects.

IBM helps you donate computer power to fight Ebola... 
BRANDON BAILEY | December 3, 2014 06:31 AM EST | Associated Press
OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — IBM has engineered a way for everyone to join the fight against Ebola — by donating processing time on their personal computers, phones or tablets to researchers.
IBM has teamed with scientists at Scripps Research Institute in southern California on a project that aims to combine the power of thousands of small computers, to each attack tiny pieces of a larger medical puzzle that might otherwise require a supercomputer to solve.
"This could let us do in months what it would otherwise take years and years to do," said Erica Ollmann Saphire, a biomedical researcher at Scripps.
The idea isn't new: Several universities and research institutes have used so-called distributed computing to tackle complex problems. For the last 10 years IBM has sponsored a project called World Community Grid, in which volunteers agree to download software that takes advantage of unused processing capacity on their devices. About 680,000 individuals in 80 countries have enrolled in the IBM program, said IBM vice president Stan Litow. They've donated computing power to help scientists at several institutions conduct research into malaria, AIDS, cancer and environmental issues.
The free downloadable software, available at www.worldcommunitygrid.org, works on Windows or Mac computers and Android mobile devices, although not Apple Inc.'s iPhone or iPad. Litow said it's designed to only use idle capacity when a device is connected to the Internet. Otherwise it isn't in use, so it won't slow other functions. On mobile devices, the program only works when the device is charging and connected to Wi-Fi, to avoid draining batteries or running up wireless charges.
Users can choose when their device connects to the grid network and whether it should happen automatically, Litow said. IBM also promises to respect volunteers' privacy and says the software can't access or alter any other files on a device.
The grid computing program breaks down large computing problems into thousands of smaller tasks, assigns them to individual devices and then compiles the results. Volunteers can get progress reports on each project, and IBM promises to make the resulting data available to any interested researcher.
Saphire, a microbiologist who has been working on Ebola research for 11 years, said the grid project will help with two problems. She's identified vulnerable sections of the Ebola molecule, but needs help analyzing various compounds to see which might be effective in attacking the virus at those spots. She's also working on a longer-term effort to understand how Ebola proteins change shape over time.
Commercial drug companies haven't been focused on diseases like Ebola, which mostly afflict less-developed countries, Saphire said. And with federal grant budgets shrinking, she's used crowd-funding websites to raise money for lab equipment and researchers' salaries.
"Crowd funding and crowd science gives people the opportunity to invest their idle computer hours or their ten bucks, and make a difference," she said.
International Business Machines Corp., based in Armonk, New York, joins other tech companies in the Ebola effort. Facebook and Google have both made appeals to their users to contribute to overseas Ebola relief. Google has matched user donations, while Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally donated $25 million to the effort.

Eurozone economy veering toward another recession...and
versions
LONDON (AP) — A day ahead of the European Central Bank's final policy meeting of the year, a closely watched survey indicated Wednesday that the 18-country eurozone is not far from sliding back into recession.
Financial information company Markit said its purchasing managers' index, a broad gauge of activity across the manufacturing and services sectors, slipped a full point to a 16-month low of 51.1 in November largely on the back of subdued orders. The index is also down on the initial estimate of 51.4.
The index still points to modest growth as it's above the 50 threshold between expansion and contraction.
Markit reckons the eurozone is on course to record 0.1 percent quarterly growth in the fourth quarter, with Germany and France, the region's two biggest economies, the main reasons for the subdued performance. There were some bright improvements in Markit's survey, notably in Italy and Spain.
Since emerging from its longest-ever recession last year, the eurozone economy as a whole has failed to gain traction and is stuttering along at low levels of growth. That's one reason why the ECB is under increasing pressure to do more to boost economic activity and prevent low inflation from becoming an outright fall in prices.
Markit economist Chris Williamson warned there's a "strong likelihood of the near-stagnation turning to renewed contraction in the New Year" and that "more aggressive measures are likely to be needed, and quickly implemented, if another recession is to be averted."
Few economists think the ECB is ready to announce any new measures following its meeting Thursday but most expect its president, Mario Draghi, to hint that a further stimulus could be pursued early next year.
Separately, Eurostat, the EU's statistics office, showed retail sales across the eurozone rose by a monthly 0.4 percent in October, another sign of underwhelming economic activity.

APNewsBreak: Mayor to name sustainability officer... 
JONATHAN LEMIRE | December 3, 2014 06:07 AM EST | Associated Press
NEW YORK (AP) — Mayor Bill de Blasio is set to take another step toward achieving his lofty goal of making the nation's largest city its greenest.
De Blasio on Wednesday will announce the creation of a new agency, the Office of Sustainability. He will name Nilda Mesa its first director.
Administration officials told The Associated Press about the new agency before de Blasio's public announcement later Wednesday.
Mesa held several environment-related posts with President Bill Clinton's administration and spearheaded the sustainability program at Columbia University.
Her chief task will be to work toward de Blasio's goal of having New York City cut its greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent by 2050 from its 2005 levels.
The city will pay to retrofit government buildings and offer incentives to private building owners.
Mesa said she believes the impact of Superstorm Sandy will make New Yorkers more receptive to the changes.

Rail linking Central Asia to Persian Gulf opened... 
ALEXANDER VERSHININ | December 3, 2014 05:29 AM EST | Associated Press
AK-YAYLA, Turkmenistan (AP) — A railway linking landlocked Central Asia with the Persian Gulf was officially inaugurated Wednesday in a ceremony at a remote train station on the border of Iran and Turkmenistan.
The the presidents of Iran, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan attended the official opening of the line in the Turkmen frontier village of Ak-Yayla. Children handed white gloves to the leaders, together bolted a final golden-colored segment of track into place.
The 928-kilometer (577-mile) route, which runs from western Kazakhstan to the northern Iranian city of Gorgan, will substantially speed the movement of cargo between a long-isolated region and markets in the Middle East and Asia.
The railway fits into a broader multinational effort to build a network of transportation links to ease the movement of freight in Western Europe, Russia, South Asia and the Far East.
A video presentation illustrated the point by explaining that travel time between the ports of Lianyungang in China and Bandar Abbas in Iran will be shortened to 13 days from the current 22 days by using speedier overland routes.
The rail route inaugurated Wednesday will initially have a capacity to carry up to 5 million tons of cargo annually, but that figure is projected to increase to 12 million tons. It is also planned that the line could eventually be opened to passengers.
In a speech at the cross-border station, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the opening of the route represented a historic breakthrough for the region.
"Today, I want to express my unbounded joy," he said.

World stocks drift; Japan  China pull back gains...and
versions
TOKYO (AP) — Record highs on Wall Street helped push Asian stocks higher Thursday, led by a surge on the Tokyo market, which was cheered by the strong dollar and polls showing the pro-business ruling party will win upcoming elections.
KEEPING SCORE: The Nikkei, the benchmark for the Tokyo Stock Exchange, jumped 0.7 percent to 17,847.90. South Korea's Kospi gained 0.7 percent to 1,982.83. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.8 percent to 23,608.18. Shares were also higher in Singapore, Australia, Taiwan and Indonesia.
US ECONOMY: After rebounding from a slump in mid-October, stocks have been gradually moving higher on optimism that the U.S. economy will continue to improve next year. On Friday, data on U.S. employment will be released, possibly adding to such hopes.
JAPAN VOTE: Public opinion polls point to a victory for the ruling party of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in nationwide elections set for later this month. That's another factor boosting stock prices. The "Abenomics" policy of easy money to overcome deflation and engineer a weak yen has been a plus for corporate profits.
ANALYST TAKE: Rikiya Takebe, analyst at Okasan Online Securities Co. in Tokyo, says the dollar's strength against the yen is foremost in investors' minds, with anticipation the Nikkei could reach 18,000 levels. "We are all paying attention to this key idea that the dollar might reach 120 yen," he said on his blog.
WALL STREET: In New York, shares finished at record highs. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 7.78 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,074.33. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 33.07 points, or 0.2 percent, to 17,912.62. The Nasdaq composite climbed 18.66 points, or 0.4 percent, to 4,774.47.
ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude was up 28 cents at $67.66 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
CURRENCIES: The euro was little changed at $1.231. The dollar was trading at 119.91 yen, inching up from 119.83 yen. The dollar approaching 120 yen levels is great news for Japan's manufacturers such as Toyota Motor Corp., and is expected to buoy the Nikkei.

Mailbag: Searching for signs of future hopeBy Mike Jones December 2 Follow @mikejoneswapo
Redskins linebacker Keenan Robinson, left, wrapping up San Francisco’s Michael Crabtree, has been one of few bright spots. (Ben Margot/Associated Press)
The Washington Redskins continue to roll down this track like a runaway train, heading for nowhere but another disastrous end.
The frustration in the fan base continues to grow, and it’s 100 percent understandable.
In today’s mailbag, we try to find something for you to cling to – some sliver of hope – regarding the future of this franchise.
Thanks, as always, for taking part, and keep the questions coming.
E-mail me at mike.jones@washpost.com with the subject line of “Mailbag question,” and we’ll do it all over again next week following the FedEx Field meeting with the Rams.
What bright spots moving forward should we as fans hope for? Year in and out the same issues seem to surface: Injuries and personality conflicts, or lack of talent, bad coaching – it seems like the same old. This company/team still makes money when most do not being this dysfunctional. I pay for season tickets and feel as though I am giving my hard-earned money away for trash. When will we as deserving and supporting fans have our say and day of reckoning? Seems like we are forgotten in this mess. We are tired and jaded, waiting for the next fumble or interception or loss. A negative mind-set is not healthy. Yet, we put up with this. Mike, tell us as fans: Where is that light at the end of this long tunnel?
– Tim Moseng
I wish I could say that I saw light at the end of the tunnel, but instead, this team and its fan base seems very far from it.
You don’t know who your quarterback is going forward. There are multiple holes on the offensive line outside of left tackle Trent Williams and center Kory Lichtensteiger; young prospects Morgan Moses, Spencer Long and Josh LeRibeus need more work before they become reliable linemen. The skill players: Alfred Morris, DeSean Jackson, Jordan Reed (if healthy) and Niles Paul are quality players, and Logan Paulsen is reliable in his role. But without answers at quarterback, they’re limited.
Defensively? The only long-term bright spots seem to be Keenan Robinson, Ryan Kerrigan and Bashaud Breeland. I don’t know about David Amerson and Phillip Thomas yet. The linemen for the most part are either just average, or getting old. There is no dominant pass rusher on this team. Kerrigan is solid, but not dominant. Jason Hatcher has looked like a fish out of water for the most part. Perry Riley Jr. is inconsistent. Will Compton, who is behind him, does seem to have some potential. Trent Murphy isn’t strong enough yet. He has done some good things in the run game, but is still very inconsistent and doesn’t look like a dominant pass rusher.
This team still has so many holes, and there’s nothing to suggest that Bruce Allen has the smarts and creativity to know how to fix this thing. There have been way too many misses in the draft and free agency. This thing doesn’t look like one or two pieces away from a fix. It could be a long time before this team becomes a contender again.
With all the discussions regarding RGIII and Colt McCoy, why is there nothing said about Kirk Cousins? He had some good games and some bad games, but why is he not even in the discussion anymore? Did he complain or criticize the coaches, have a meltdown, or do something that totally disqualifies him from ever playing again?
– Dan Glaser
Cousins has been the good soldier. He hasn’t criticized his coaches, hasn’t been disruptive in the locker room or quarterback meeting room. He has continued to work hard, trying to learn as much as possible and find ways to get better. But he’s not playing because coaches don’t see him as a better option to McCoy or Griffin. They like the way he moves the offense, but his turnover tendencies and his response to adversity is troubling to coaches.
Right now, they think that both McCoy and Griffin both do a better job of taking care of the ball. They see McCoy as the most experienced quarterback, who does a good job of playing within the system and also handles pressure and adversity well. They didn’t see improvement in Cousins, and so, Gruden went with McCoy at midseason, and then went back to him after Griffin’s struggles continued. That doesn’t mean Cousins will never play again. But for now, he’s not close to leap-frogging the other two quarterbacks.
What is A.J. Smith’s current role with the team? Granted he doesn’t have the best track record, but with the situation calling for change in the organizational structure and need for a personnel guy, is there any chance that this offseason that we see him take a more involved role in player selection?
– Jey Williams, Martinsburg W.Va.
That’s a very good question. The Redskins have never been very clear on what Smith does. We know he assists Bruce Allen with some form of talent evaluation. This year he has been at Redskins Park much more than he was the previous season. He also attends many of the games. He also attended offseason events like the Senior Bowl and the NFL Scouting Combine.
So far, we haven’t seen evidence of improvements that have stemmed from Smith’s presence. We don’t know who all is calling the shots, but the Redskins drafted eight players, wound up keeping five, and only Trent Murphy and Bashaud Breeland play regularly. Few free agent signings have panned out, either. DeSean Jackson has been the one stone-cold lock of a hit. Jason Hatcher hasn’t lived up to expectations. Akeem Jordan, Darryl Sharpton, Adam Hayward and Tracy Porter all got hurt. Clifton Geathers didn’t make it through a full season. Brian Orakpo, whom Allen & Co. gave the franchise tag, grossly underperformed and then got hurt. Shawn Lauvao has struggled. Andre Roberts has just been okay. Not great, not bad.
It was evident that this team needs help on the offensive line as McCoy got sacked six times on Sunday. So we learned this Sunday that McCoy can still play football in this league. But wouldn’t you also say that it would be a big mistake (more like dumb) to let Robert Griffin III go after this season? Would it be wise to pick Cousins over RGIII? A wise man would probably iron out some sort of extension for him to see if he can develop into a franchise QB. But who has ever accused the Redskins of being wise?
– Olufemi Adepoju
The line definitely needs work, but most of those sacks were either a result of tight ends blowing assignments, or McCoy holding on to the ball too long. There was a sack that right tackle Tom Compton gave up because of poor execution. But yes, they definitely need to invest in the line more heavily.
As far as Griffin’s future goes, this all depends on how McCoy plays. Right now, the coaching staff has little to no confidence in Griffin. A number of people within the organization have concerns that he is unfixable, and also have serious reservations about spending another precious year hoping that he can develop. You mess around with a guy for too long, and that’s how you get fired. No head coach wants to toil away with a quarterback and not see signs of progress after that first year, and then spend another fruitless year on that quarterback and then go into Year 3 of a five-year contract, if he gets a Year 3, starting all over again at the most important position on the field.
But the Redskins don’t have to do anything with Griffin. He’s under contract for next season already. They could let him continue to work and then enter next training camp in a full-on competition with McCoy, or whoever the other quarterback option is. But we don’t know what Griffin’s mind-set will be this offseason. Will he want to be here under those circumstances? Will he be content to remain in the shadows as a backup and not disrupt things if he doesn’t win the job? There are a lot of unanswered questions right now.
What’s the thinking behind finally putting Santana Moss in a game? You’d think that would have a move to be made weeks ago, when the offense was starting their disintegration. Wasn’t he a favorite target of Griffin? Why didn’t they play him much earlier?
– Jim Nolan, Clancy, Mont.
Santana Moss has dressed for six games this season, but Sunday he played a season-high 28 snaps on offense as well as eight on special teams. He also recorded his first receptions of the year (three for 30 yards).
Moss’s lack of involvement has been a curious case. He is caught in the numbers game, as the team can only afford to dress so many wide receivers, and Pierre Garcon, DeSean Jackson and Andre Roberts receive the bulk of the offensive snaps. Coaches have continued to say they know Moss can play, though.
On Sunday, we saw Moss begin rotating in and out of the game more often. Part of this has to do with the fact that Garcon and Jackson have started waving to the sideline for substitutes more often. And then, Jackson got hurt, so that created more opportunities for Moss. The reliable veteran proved that he still has what it takes, catching all three passes that came his way. He has great versatility, so it hasn’t made a lot of sense why he hasn’t been used more often, especially considering the inconsistencies we have seen from Roberts.
I really like the way Colt McCoy is playing, although it is obvious he needs more reps and better protection. My question: it seems like only McCoy and a couple of other players showed up to play. What happened to the rest? Are they already giving up on the season since they do not have any chances for the playoffs? If that is the case, how sad that would be.
– Fernando Cuenca
Jay Gruden also noticed that not everyone seemed like they came to play . In Monday’s press conference, he discussed the poor tempo and body language that he observed in his players, and how he wants to see improvements in this area. If you’re a fan, you would hope that the players haven’t started to give up. But you can be sure that the coaches and team officials will be watching closely. Gruden has challenged the players , saying these are the four most important games of their careers. He said that if he doesn’t see resolve out of players, those offenders will not be a part of the plans for next year.
What I am interested about is the youth on this team. How do you feel about guys like Frank Kearse, Will Compton, Greg Ducre, and Morgan Moses going forward? Could you see any of them starting next year? Now Porter and [E.J.] Biggers are hurt, does another San Francisco-like performance get Ducre a future key role on this team?
– Kelechi Nwanevu
I do think that there’s a chance that many of the players mentioned have futures with this team.
The Redskins drafted Moses this year, hoping that he can be the long-term solution at right tackle. Thus far, he has failed to overtake Tom Compton. But after another offseason in the system, he could contend for the job during training camp. Moses did a good job of using his length to his advantage against Tampa Bay. He struggled against San Francisco, but Aldon Smith is a monster.
Coaches really like Will Compton, and there’s definitely a chance that he competes for that starting job next to Robinson. Riley once was seen as a long-time fixture on this defense, but he has had his share of ups and down this year, so nothing is out of the question. I’d expect the Redskins to move on from Porter and Biggers, although Porter is under contract for next season. That would at least give Ducre a chance to go into the offseason battling for a spot.
But if they think that Ducre is an answer for a key role in the secondary, then that’s another sign of complacency. If DeAngelo Hall can make a full recovery, I see him fighting for that nickelback role. But the team should also make other investments at the cornerback position, and they simply have to spend money on safeties. Phillip Thomas will get a chance to show what he can do down this final stretch, particularly if Brandon Meriweather is sidelined with that big-toe sprain . But the team needs to make drastic moves to upgrade this defense.
As far as other young players go, Long and LeRibeus will try to earn starting jobs. But as with safety, the Redskins can’t just go into the offseason counting on those two. They should make additional acquisitions to significantly beef up the line.
E-mail a Redskins question to mike.jones@washpost.com, with the subject “Mailbag question,” and it might be answered Tuesday in the  Mailbag .

Stephen Hawking just got an artificial intelligence upgrade  but still thinks AI could bring an end to mankindBy Peter Holley December 2 Follow @peterjholley
British theoretical physicist  Stephen Hawking and Pete Denman, Intel's user experience designer, speak to members of the media at a news conference in London on Dec. 2, 2014. (Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images)
When it comes to discussing the dangers of artificial intelligence, the renowned theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking doesn't exactly mince words.
"I think the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race," the Cambridge University professor told the BBC  in an interview that touched upon everything from online privacy to his affinity for his robotic-sounding voice.
Despite its current usefulness, he cautioned, further developing AI could prove a fatal mistake.
"Once humans develop artificial intelligence, it will take off on it's own and redesign itself at an ever-increasing rate," Hawking warned for the second time in recent months . "Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn't compete and would be superseded."
It's not that AI isn't useful, as Hawking well knows.
The cosmologist lives with the motor neuron disease  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Lou Gehrig's Disease. As his disease has progressed, he has become almost entirely paralyzed. And in 1985, after contracting pneumonia, Hawking underwent a tracheotomy that left him unable to speak. He is only able to communicate verbally using the assistance of a computer.
After initially losing his voice, Hawking communicated using a spelling card that allowed him to indicate words by lifting his eyebrows, according to detailed retelling of Hawking's struggle to communicate in Wired . Next came a speech synthesizer linked to an Apple computer that allowed Hawking to communicate at a rate of 15 words per minute. In 2008, when Hawking's hand became too weak to operate the system, he switched to a newly devised "cheek switch," according to the magazine:
Attached to his glasses, it could detect, via a low infrared beam, when Hawking tensed his cheek muscle. Since then, Hawking has achieved the feat of writing e-mails, browsing the Internet, writing books and speaking using only one muscle.
On Tuesday, Hawking and Intel announced that he is now using the latest iteration of a system is known as ACAT (Assistive Context Aware Toolkit), which uses a more advanced form of artificial intelligence. The company has worked with on the technology since 2008.
Years of testing and upgrading with the Intel team since the partnership with Hawking began eventually led to ACAT.  Hawking told the BBC that the system, which represents a significant upgrade, uses predictive text based on an analysis of the English language and his own speech patterns. He expects it to speed up his writing and he can use the system to access to e-mail and the Internet, he noted.
Intel is now giving researchers and tech developers the opportunity to build on the platform, according to CNET:
The Intel platform will become available for free to researchers and developers next month,
 with the hope that it could become the foundation for a modern communication system to help people with motor neuron diseases and quadriplegia. Intel's new toolkit can be customized for different users,
 and be enabled by touch,
 eye blinks,
 eyebrow movements or other inputs for communication.
Even so, Hawking said he's still fond of his old technology.
"My old system worked well and I wrote five books with it, including 'A Brief History of Time,' " he said, noting that the book remained on the London Sunday Times list for years.
Hawking said he could change his robotic-sounding voice, but chooses not to.
"It has become my trademark and I wouldn't change it for a more natural voice with a British accent," he said. "I am told that children who need a computer voice want one like mine."

Body-worn cameras for police Britain started long agoA closed-circuit surveillance camera keeps watch near the Houses of Parliament. Britain long ago started equipping police officers with video cameras. (AP Photo/Lefteris Pitarakis)
George Orwell would hardly be surprised.
Britain, already among the most surveilled societies on the planet, began experimenting with body-worn video cameras on police nearly a decade ago, long before departments in the United States started to adopt the technology.
President Obama said Monday that he intends to  ask Congress for funding for to expand such programs , adding to calls from the family of Michael Brown and others that police should be compelled to wear cameras that record their encounters with citizens and suspects.
“There is no question that this is here to stay,” said Michael White, a criminology professor at Arizona State University who has studied the adoption of the technology. “Police chiefs and mid-level managers have been telling officers, hopefully for years now, that whatever they do on the street is being recorded,” whether by surveillance cameras or bystanders holding smartphones. When officers themselves employ the technology, he says, “it has the potential to increase police legitimacy.”
The key word is potential. White, the author of a Justice Department survey of the existing literature on the use of the cameras, found little empirical evidence to support the most of the claims of the proponents and critics of the devices, mainly because the research has been scant.
The earliest studies come from Britain. An assessment of the use of the cameras in the English city of Plymouth in 2006 and 2007 was intended to determine whether the cameras aided officers in gathering evidence and winning convictions — and they did. Time spent on paperwork went down and suspects were more likely to confess to crimes if officers had captured the misdeed on video.
But there was no clear evidence in Plymouth, and in other British and American cities where the use of the cameras has been studied, that their use improved people’s impressions of the police. “Citizen support for use of body-worn cameras remains unclear, as does the impact of the technology on citizens’ trust in the police (e.g., increased transparency and legitimacy),” White wrote in his report.
In an interview, White said that more research is required, and noted that studies of some U.S. cities — including Rialto, Calif. and the Arizona cities of Mesa and Phoenix – show that use of body-worn cameras results in a reduction of citizen complaints about police and in the use of force.
One of the complexities involved in the use of body-worn cameras is the storage, handling and use of the recorded images. Indeed, much of the official guidance prepared by British authorities concerns the technical and legal issues raised by recording innumerable encounters between citizens and law enforcement officials.
As is the case with mugshots and other images captured by public authorities, sooner or later the material can become public — and that opens up a whole new category of video viewing opportunities. London’s Metropolitan Police this May released this video, of a suspect apparently confessing to robbing and stabbing someone, as the department rolled out its use of body-worn cameras. (The acronym GBH stands for grievous bodily harm, the charge for which the person in the video was arrested.)
For a viewing public already used to dash-cam video and police ride-along footage, body-worn camera images may provide more intense and vivid sense of what officers encounter. “So much of what a line officer does in big city and urban policing occurs away from the police vehicle,” White said. “The potential is there to educate the public on the realities of police work.”

Watchdog says China stumbling badly in ballyhooed anti-corruption fightBy Simon Denyer December 2 Follow @simondenyer
A high-profile anti-corruption campaign launched last year by Chinese President Xi Jinping seems to be very popular with the general public. Unfortunately it doesn’t appear to be working very well -- at least in the view of experts around the world.
The global anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International (TI), in its latest Corruption Perceptions Index found that China had tumbled farther down the list since last year's report than any other country, dropping 20 places. It now occupies 100th place on the list, out of 175 countries surveyed.
TI’s rankings measure perceptions of corruption in each country’s public sector from a variety of different sources. China this year scored 36 points on a scale where 100 equals total purity. That means it is perceived as slightly more corrupt than places like Colombia, Egypt and Liberia. By contrast, this year’s least corrupt country, Denmark, scored 92. The most corrupt were North Korea and Somalia, which each scored 8.
In China, Xi has vowed to catch both the tigers and the flies – the high-level and low-level officials – responsible for graft, and there have already been several high-profile defendants. The campaign rarely leaves the news, and undoubtedly has had an effect on how brazen officials are about flaunting and spending their ill-gotten gains, with a well-documented decline in demand for luxury goods in China.
This week, the former Portuguese colony of Macau, the only part of China where gambling is legal, reported the  first contraction in its economy for five years in the third quarter of 2014. The reason, apparently, was a big drop in revenues at casinos, partly linked to China’s economic slowdown but also blamed on the campaign to eradicate graft.
At the same time, China Daily newspaper reported a drop in the number of people taking a highly competitive exam to join the civil service. The paper said the decline was connected to the anti-corruption campaign that had dampened the attractiveness of a job in the public sector for some students.
So why is China not doing better on TI’s index?
One possible reason, according to TI’s Rukshana Nanayakkara, is that China has embarked on a top-down campaign that is focused more on punishing people rather than systemic fixes. Punishment can create a short-term deterrent effect, and is good public relations for the president, but it may be less effective if the victims are perceived as having been selected for more for political than legal reasons – the investigation into former security chief Zhou Yongkang is a good example.
And it won’t have as much effect as a multi-faceted campaign that involves civil society , is built on an independent investigative agency and judicial authority, and reduces incentives for public sector graft. “If you want to fight corruption, it has to come from the bottom, from the grassroots – rather than just punishing people,” Nanayakkara says.
Civil society activists in China who have demanded that officials declare their assets have been locked up for their troubles, while public servants enjoy enormous power thanks to multiple layers of red tape, but earn poor salaries – the perfect ingredients for bribery to thrive. Under Chinese law, Nanayakkara adds, a bribe is also not criminalized if it falls below the equivalent of $820 for an individual or $32,700 for a company.
A recent report on state news agency Xinhua that presented corruption in China as a systemic problem was subsequently deleted, the South China Morning Post reported this week -- apparently  because it contradicted the party line that ascribes it not to the system but to individual moral weaknesses.
But it might be too early to write China’s anti-corruption campaign off completely.

Southbound GW Parkway reopens after sinkhole disrupts traffic(Related:  Commuters react to sinkhole that caused major delays on GW Parkway )
Updated at 9:16 a.m.
After 12 hours of crews working to fix a pothole that shut down the southbound lanes of the George Washington Memorial Parkway, federal highway officials said they ‘ll now try to figure out what caused the problem.
The roadway’s southbound lanes between Route 123 and Spout Run Parkway were closed all day Tuesday after a sinkhole was discovered Monday night. Crews arrived on the scene around 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday and finished fixing the roadway around 8:30 p.m. the same day. But a small portion of the roadway was still closed in the early morning hours Wednesday because the asphalt was drying in the wet, damp conditions, according to officials at the Federal Highway Administration.
The entire stretch reopened shortly after 6 a.m. Wednesday. On Tuesday, the closure of the roadway caused traffic delays throughout the morning rush hour.
Federal highway officials said Wednesday that they are not immediately sure what caused the sinkhole but are looking into it.
“They were focused on fixing the problem rather than studying it,” said Doug Hecox, a spokesman for the Federal Highway Administration, which was in charge of helping fix the pothole. He said there could be a variety of reasons for sinkholes, including water accumulating underneath the roadway or “changing geological conditions way, way underground.”
“They’re not easily predictable,” he said. He said the 12-hour fix was “especially fast when you consider all the weird weather.” Typically, it is a bit faster and easier to fix roadway problems with asphalt when it is warm and dry.

All of the southbound lanes on the George Washington Memorial Parkway are now open after a sinkhole shut it down Tuesday.
Updated at 4:30 a.m. Wednesday
Some of the southbound lanes of the George Washington Memorial Parkway reopened early Wednesday morning, but some work remains on part of the roadway as crews continue to fix an area where a sinkhole erupted.
A sinkhole had led to the shut down of all southbound lanes at Route 123 all day Tuesday.
In a Twitter message, the U.S. Park Police said that the GW Parkway “is open – one right lane closure SB at Windy Run is in place. All lanes will be open for morning commute.”
Around 4:30 a.m., the police said that crews were finishing up some work on the GW Parkway at Windy Run. Drivers can only get by in that section in the right lane at this time, they said.
Both of the southbound lanes on the parkway are expected to fully reopen soon, although police said they did not have a specific time on the reopening. Late Tuesday night, highway officials had said the roadway’s southbound lanes would fully reopen by 5 a.m.
The Tuesday shutdown of the parkway caused major traffic delays in the morning commute.

One southbound lane of the George Washington Memorial Parkway was reopened Tuesday night after repair of a large sinkhole which shut down the lanes at Route 123 since Monday night.
However, the U.S. Park Police said that one southbound lane of the parkway remained closed at Windy Run. Sgt. Lelani Woods said it would reopen at 4 a.m. Wednesday.
Updated at 4:01 p.m.
As work continued to repair a large sinkhole on the George Washington Memorial Parkway, Federal Highway Administration spokesman Doug Hecox said he expected the road would be entirely open to traffic by 5 a.m.
Updated at 12:46 p.m.
Work is underway to repair a large sinkhole on the southbound lanes of the George Washington Memorial Parkway at Route 123, and officials now say they expect the roadway to reopen before Wednesday morning’s rush hour.
“The backfilling is underway,” said Doug Hecox, a spokesman for the Federal Highway Administration. “We have equipment ready to begin the paving as soon as the backfilling is finished.” He said the sinkhole is being backfilled with dirt and rock.
“The current estimate,” Hecox said, is that the parkway would reopen “tomorrow before rush hour.” But he cautioned that he did not know exactly when that would be and that officials still needed to coordinate with the U.S. Park Police, the agency that helps oversees the roadway.
The southbound lanes of the GW Parkway in that area have been closed since early Tuesday morning and created a headache for commuters, with some people reporting drives of up to three hours to reach their destinations.
Hecox said federal highway crews that are now at the site have found that the sinkhole is “not as large as it was originally estimated to be.” Officials now say the sinkhole measures 10 feet by 5 feet.
Updated at 11:05 a.m.
Federal Highway officials said it is likely to take crews more than five or six hours to fix a large pothole that closed the southbound lanes of the George Washington Parkway at Route 123 on Tuesday morning.
Fixing a sinkhole of this size typically takes five to six hours — if conditions are dry and warm. But with the cold temperatures and rainy conditions, it is expected to take longer. Officials said that means it is likely that the parkway’s southbound lanes will remain closed through Tuesday evening’s rush hour and could be closed into Wednesday morning’s rush hour, as well.
“With the cold, it is likely all of the work will be done late tonight,” said Doug Hecox, a spokesman at the Federal Highway Administration. He said it will be up to the U.S. Park Police to decide when to reopen the road. Just before 11 a.m., Sgt. Lelani Woods, a spokeswoman for the park police, said in an e-mail: “It is still unknown as to how long the closures will be in effect, however, with weather permitting repair efforts can begin soon.”
One problem in fixing the sinkhole, highway officials said, is that it depends on how the asphalt reacts with the wet weather.
“Asphalt requires warmer weather and prefers drier weather,” Hecox said. “When you have water and colder weather, it complicates the behavior of the pavement.” He said crews may have to put asphalt down in chunks and may have to go back over it with a paver several times.
Federal highway officials said that roughly 60,000 vehicles a day travel that segment of the George Washington Parkway. They estimate that roughly 100,000 vehicles were affected by the closure of the GW Parkway on Tuesday morning.
Hecox said that when that portion of the GW Parkway is “out of commission, those drivers are forced onto other routes.”
“It could be that 100,000 drivers are inconvenienced by this little hole,” he said. “It is all the more reason for us to work quickly.”
He said a crew of roughly a dozen people is working to repair the roadway. “It is a heavily traveled route,” Hecox said. “We can’t afford for that road to be closed for that long.”
He said the Federal Highway Administration learned of the sinkhole around 7 p.m. Monday. Crews had to wait until daybreak Tuesday to get a better sense of the size of the hole and figure out what equipment would be needed to fix it.
The exact cause of the sinkhole is unknown, but Hecox said it could be “due to geological structures underneath” or potholes. He said the recent warm — and then cold — temperatures in the area can also create something that is known as a “freeze thaw,” where pavement expands and contracts. “That can aggravate existing potholes and make it bigger,” he said.
Updated at 9:58 a.m.
Highway officials said the George Washington Parkway southbound lanes will likely remain closed for Tuesday evening’s rush hour and not reopen until Wednesday morning.
At 9:54 a.m., Federal Highway Administration officials said equipment was coming from another project on the Clara Barton Parkway and work to fix the sinkhole on the GW Parkway’s southbound lanes at Route 123 would begin “within the next hour.” Officials said workers would begin to remove pavement and backfill the hole Tuesday afternoon.
Doug Hecox, a spokesman at the Federal Highway Administration, said the conditions of rain are “not favorable” for fixing and repaving the sinkhole. But he said, “given the tens of thousands of drivers that cont on that route, we’re going to pave in the rain anyway. It will be a rough, ugly patch.” He said it is possible that the southbound lanes of the parkway could open Tuesday but “for now, we anticipate it will be open Wednesday morning.”
Officials also closed the ramps on Interstate 495 of both the inner and outer loops to southbound George Washington Parkway at Exit 43 until further notice so crews could repair the roadway.

Earlier post:
A sinkhole has closed the southbound lanes of the George Washington Parkway at Route 123 Tuesday morning and caused several miles of traffic backups in the surrounding area. The roadway will be closed in the southbound direction until at least noon, federal highway officials said.
The southbound lanes are closed between Route 123 and Spout Run Parkway.
The hole at its surface, according to U.S. Park Police officials, measures roughly six feet wide by three feet long. But federal highway officials said their engineers have found that the size of the hole below the surface is larger. Hecox said just before 9 a.m. that the sinkhole measures 25 feet wide by 3 feet wide “from one side to the other side.” He said there is a “bigger void below the visible hole.”
“You’re just seeing the top of the hole,” Hecox said. Engineers on the scene, he said, are saying the sinkhole is 25 feet wide “from the furthest part of the void.”
“It is a big empty spot,” Hecox said. “There is a larger hole. A lot of that is underneath the pavement and you can’t see it.”
The sinkhole was discovered around 7 p.m. Monday when there was a crash involving four vehicles along the parkway, according to Sgt. Lelani Woods, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Park Police. There were no reports of injuries. Woods said it is possible that the hole may have started as a pothole and gotten larger because of weather conditions.

On Tuesday morning, there were reports of several miles of backups on the GW Parkway and some surrounding roads. U.S. Park Police  advised drivers to use alternate routes into the District, including Clara Barton Parkway, Route 50 and Glebe Road. But some drivers reported traffic was backed up along those roads as well.
Metro said its buses in the Rosslyn area are having to take alternate routes because of the sinkhole problem. At 8:30, its buses on the 15K and 15L routes were running up to one hour late in both directions.
“Traffic is backed up,” Woods said. Traffic southbound on Route 123 is bumper-to-bumper and commuters are seeing tail lights, as far back as Interstate 495, she said. Drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Virginia Department of Transportation officials said just before 8 a.m. that there were roughly four-mile backups along Interstate 495 north as a spillover from the GW Parkway closure.

Balancing risks and rewards in cricketBalancing risks and rewards in cricket
D SAMPATH KUMAR
Tweet
Cricket needs to be an engaging contest between bat and ball, rather than an engineered, if not contrived, spectacle
Philip Hughes’ death on a cricket field in Australia is a tragedy of monumental proportions. Cricket can no longer escape the odium that it is a dangerous sport and on a par with professional boxing. There will be the inevitable soul searching and calls upon the cricket administration to come up with new measures to make it safer for players involved in the game.
But is that the only take-away from this tragedy? Is his death not also a pointer to the fact that the game of cricket had somewhere along the way, broken a cardinal principle common to all sporting encounters -- that there should be a fine balance between risks and rewards, in this battle between a ball weighing five and a half ounces and a bat that is 38 inches long and 4.25 inches wide? Has this balance been broken over the years and something had to give which in this case, meant the loss of a precious young human life?
‘Gulli-danda’
The concept of a risk-reward and how this ties in with actions of players engaged in a sporting contest can be best illustrated with reference to the native Indian game of gulli-danda. The batter takes strike with a danda in his hand. The gulli is placed on a short and shallow pit. The batter’s task is to scoop the gulli from the pit to set the game rolling.
But his opponents are standing in front of him waiting to pouch the gulli before it falls to the ground. The batter has a choice. He can play it safe by simply pushing it along the ground and thus escape being declared out as ‘caught’. But he runs another risk with this gambit. His opponents could stop the gulli close enough to the pit and pitch it back such that the batter is declared out because he had failed to stop it landing within one danda length from the pit. Closer the pitcher is to the batter, lesser is the reaction time available to the latter.
Think of a batsman in cricket having to defend his wicket when the bowler is hurling the ball not from a 22-yard distance but from only say, 10 yards! But scooping it with a mighty heave over the heads of fielders waiting to pouch it has its own share of risk.
The batter might mistime the heave and the ‘gulli’ instead of soaring off into the far distance ends up as a spooned offering for the opponents to pouch with relative ease. In any case the opposing team might position fielders at strategic distances that the batter ends up being declared ‘out’ caught. The rules of the game are so inventive there are many other situations where players have to take calculated decisions balancing the risks and rewards inherent in them.
Losing it
The game becomes enjoyable because the odds are even and the risk-reward ratios are within acceptable limits. Outcomes of sporting encounters are then reduced to intrinsic differences in skills exhibited by participants at any particular moment of time. Cricket started out as a game where the risk-reward equations for both bowlers and batsmen were finely balanced.
But somewhere along the way players and administrators (who must, in this context, be viewed as players) decided to alter the equation in their favour to the disadvantage of others in the game. For instance, batsmen began to experiment with heavier bats so that even mishits began to clear the boundary ropes. In other words, the situation has been altered to provide for higher rewards even as it reduced the risk.
The bowlers too, on their part, with some generous help from their colleagues on the field let it be said, resorted to ‘sledging’ with a view to unsettle batsmen. They too, were engaged in altering the risk-reward equation in their favour. It was called ‘mental disintegration’ as if that somehow made it more acceptable.
The administrators were not keeping quiet either. It somehow dawned on them that spectators want to see ‘sixers’ being hit and so obliged the batsmen by bringing in the boundary ropes further in, which accentuated the advantage already available to the latter with their heavier bats.
Should pitches be covered or not covered against ingress of moisture is another way of altering the risk-reward relationships. So too are rules aimed at restricting the number of bouncers per over or altering the definition of what constitutes ‘intimidatory’ bowling.
In short, every effort was made by every player involved with the game to alter the fine balance between risk and reward. The point is not that Philip Hughes was reckless in his shot selection because the odds favoured him and which eventually led to his untimely death. The point is even if players are themselves not motivated to push the envelope further and further to reduce the odds and increase their payoff, nature has its own way of ending such imbalances. A ‘black swan’ event occurs.
Let skills clash
Who knows, had batsmen not been allowed to experiment with heavier bats and administrators not permitted to shorten the boundary distances, the world of cricket might well have evolved as a sporting contest between batsmen and spinners rather than one between a battery of fast bowlers and batsmen as is the case now. Before one shouts “Shane Warne’ the statistics on the number of wickets captured by spinners and those by fast bowlers speak for themselves. The South Africans didn’t get to be the number one team because they relied on the wizardry and artistry of spin bowling by JP Duminy.
The English gave the world, the game of cricket. But they also gave the world, its language. There is a reason why the English say, ‘Honesty is the Best Policy’. They could have said, “Honesty is Godliness’ or that it is spiritually uplifting. Honesty is neither a virtue nor its anti-thesis, dishonesty, a vice. If neither the passage through the gates of heaven nor being consigned to the flames of hell is certain, why then, is it the ‘best policy’?
As the English reasoned, as behoving a nation of shopkeepers, in situations where honesty-dishonesty choices exist, outcomes in the long run, are favourable if the choice is made consistently in favour of staying honest.
To use the language of probability theory, the expected value of rewards of acting dishonestly is far inferior to the expected value of punishment likely to be meted out for such behaviour. Honesty as a behavioural choice thus connotes a reluctance to artificially alter the odds in one’s favour.
Cricket would do well to go back to what sporting encounters ought really to be: A battle between skills of two sets of people without artful embellishments.

What it takes to pay off $80 000 in loan debt  in three yearsBy Jonnelle Marte December 1 Follow @jonnelle
(Photo from Flickr used under Creative Commons license from user Miran Rijavec )
When Austin Netzley graduated from college in 2008, finding out how much he had in debt — more than $80,000 after interest between his student loans and car loan — made him sick to his stomach.
He was fortunate to have a job, a well-paying one at that, but he still owed more than what he would earn his first year of work. But his desire to make more money at times interfered with his plans to get rid of the debt, pushing him to reduce his debt payments so that he could invest — and sometimes lose — money in the stock market.
Still, Netzley managed to become debt free within three years, freeing up more time and money to help him launch an investment business. This month he released a book, Make Money, Live Wealthy , in which he shares lessons he learned from conversations with 75 entrepreneurs.
Netzley recently spoke with The Washington Post about how he balanced paying off his debt with saving for retirement and investing on the side. This conversation was edited for length and clarity.
How much did you think about your student loans while you were in school? Is it something you worried about or had a good grasp on?
Austin Netzley, 28, paid off $80,000 in student loan debt in three years. (ONE Press Publishing)
In college I didn’t know anything about entrepreneurship, didn’t know much about investing other than I was intrigued by investing. I had this plan, I wanted to be the CEO of a large company. I wanted to get my engineering degree, get an MBA, get some sales experience and those three things were going to make me become a CEO. I went down that path and I kept asking, “What are my loans? What are my loans?” And finally my senior year I got the bill and figured out what my loans were.
I played football, so I got half scholarships and grants, basically half of my tuition covered. I got the bill and if I had paid the minimum throughout the life of the loan it was going to be over $72,000 and that just made me sick to my stomach. I still remember the feeling today.
It was my own fault for not really understanding the debt I was getting into. I kind of thought a lot of people do it, that it would just be taken care of. That it wasn’t necessarily bad debt, it was good debt. I disagree with that now. Anyhow, once I got myself in debt there was nothing that I could do with it. I had two months of school remaining so I went and finished it up and worked for an oil company in Houston and started to take my finances very seriously and within three years I paid off that debt. But during college I didn’t think about it. I did think about how to get rich, but I didn’t think much about the debt.
Once you graduated, did you want to tackle your debt right away? Or were you more concerned about setting money aside for something else or getting started with investments?
Sometimes I was super stressed. Other times I was more attracted and appealed to getting rich, so I started investing.
My first assignment on the job was to start saving in my 401(k), so I put a large percentage of my income into that from day one. Then I was going back and forth from investing money to paying off as much debt as I possibly could.
About two years into my career I started investing heavily and day trading. I started making more money in the stock market than I was paying on interest in my loans. So what I started to do was for at least six months I started to pay the minimum on my loans while I put as much money as I could toward my investments.
Then I just got sick of having that cloud of debt hanging over my head, so I paid off my remaining balance all at once, which at this point in time was like $35,000. So I took my money out of stocks and paid it all at once to get rid of it. That’s when I was officially free.
People say it’s a weight off your shoulders when you pay off debt and it really, really is. It was amazing.
Tell me about where you were investing. What percentage were you saving in your 401(k)? Did you have money elsewhere or did you take the money out of your 401(k)?
I never touched the money in the 401(k). I always had a taxable account on the side.
From day one, I put 10 percent and I moved it to 12 percent and I moved quickly up to 16 percent, sometimes even more, of my income straight into my retirement fund. That was between my roth IRA and my 401(k).
In 2009, I started to give money to my friend who was investing in a taxable account for me. Unfortunately, he wasn’t doing too well. I would give him maybe $2,000 at a time and it was up to $10,000 in 2009. And he wasn’t doing too well even though the market was going up, so that’s when I started to manage my own account.
Then I had probably $25,000 in there and started to grow that rapidly. So at one point I was putting well over 30 percent of my income toward investing, whether it be the 401(k), the Roth IRA or the taxable account. And that’s really how I kind of grew my funds quickly.
When you took control of your investment account, what kind of vehicle did you use? And where did you look for guidance?
I failed a lot. I would make a lot of money and then I would lose a lot. I was trading options. I was trying to day trade. I was doing a lot of things that now I tell people not to do. So I actually stopped trading short term for about six months while I read a lot. I joined some online groups whether it be on LinkedIn or Meetup.com just to be able to talk to anybody and learn from anybody how to invest.
I saw the potential and I saw what compound interest could do over time so I was really, really into it but I was also stressed out when I was trading and just like anybody else, my emotions were playing against me.
Then I started to have a strategy. Eventually, I created my own investing algorithm and automated it and that’s one of the businesses I have now. Long story short, I started trading anything and everything and I wasn’t making a lot of money after all the commissions and the failures. Then I stopped trading, took it seriously and started to make money.
Are you mainly using individual stocks or are you using index funds and other mutual funds?
I use ETFs as well as individual stocks. My long-term investments are in mutual funds, they are in index funds. My short term stuff is mostly in individual stocks.
Did you essentially sell all of your taxable investments to pay off the debt or did you have more set aside?
I probably had $15,000 to $20,000 in cash. I also had at least $50,000 in my taxable account.
I think I pulled out $25,000 from my brokerage account and also used $10,000 worth of cash.
As soon as I pressed submit I just teared up because it was such a burden on my for a while.
Do you think you would have been able to pay off the debt nearly as quickly without the investments on the side?
I don’t know if what I did is necessarily the best option. I think the best option for a lot of people is to take it one step at a time. I was trying to learn the game of investing while I was trying to pay off a massive debt. I could have paid it off even quicker than I did because I was saving a lot of money.
I definitely don’t regret investing, especially in my 401(k). That’s the first thing I tell everyone to do even if you do have debt because that’s free money you don’t want to leave on the table [if your company is matching contributions].
Do you think you were able to do this because you had so much disposable income or because you had so much investment income?
What I tell people is make more money than you spend and invest the difference wisely. So the three pieces are your income, your expenses and your investments.
The better you do with all three of those pieces then the easier any goal is from a wealth standpoint.
My income was much higher than most people. Coming out of college I had an engineering degree so I did have a higher income. But I worked with plenty of other people who also had higher income and less debt but they didn’t pay off their debt as quickly as me.
The second piece is expenses, so it really doesn’t matter what you make. I really kept my expenses as low as I could. I lived in Houston. I lived in Jacksonville, Fla.
It doesn’t matter what you make. It’s what you spend. Of course, the third piece is the investing piece and that gave me the opportunity to make a lot of money and gave me the opportunity to pay it off quickly.
Aside from living in a low-cost city, what else did you do to keep your expenses low?
Everything I did from a financial perspective was strategic.
The two biggest expenses people have is housing and transportation. I always had a roommate early on. The first was renting for six months while I looked for a home. The second place I lived in was a home that I bought mutually with a friend. That was a good opportunity for us to get the lowest interest rate.
We reduced each other’s rent and we took advantage of Obama’s housing credit.
My third place was a foreclosure. I bought that by myself, lived there by myself and that gave me the opportunity to have a mortgage payment of $148. I did have some housing association fees on top of it, but my housing was really low.
I did what I could in whatever place I lived to reduce my housing expenses.
The second one was transportation. I lived within 10 miles of work. In Jacksonville, I worked from home. I also had a $9,000 Honda. So my friends were all buying BMWs and new Nissans and I had this old beat up Honda. It worked for me, it did the job and it kept me from getting into additional debt. I bought it right before I graduated.
That is the car loan you had when you graduated from college. How did you handle that debt?
That one had a higher interest rate than most of my student loans so I paid that off pretty quickly, I think within six months of graduation.
What was the plan of attack for the rest of your debt?
I put every loan I had on a spreadsheet. Every balance, every interest rate, every single piece of information.
There are two methods that most people talk about. One is the snowball method that Dave Ramsey talks about [which involves paying off the smallest debt first]. The other is the stacking method, which you go after the highest interest rate first, and that’s the one I did. Since the car loan felt to me like a bad loan, since it had the second-highest interest rate, I wanted to get that debt out of the way as quick as possible.
Long story short, I paid two times the required minimum payment every month toward the car and then paid the last $2,000. That was paid off well before a year after graduation. Then after that I had just the Sallie Mae loans left and attacked those one at a time.
At some points in time I would pay the minimum on all of my loans while I invested and made more money there. It wasn’t as strategic as it should have been, but once I learned how to invest I felt like it was a better opportunity for me to make money than to pay off debt.
One other thing I tried that didn’t work was I called into as many debt relief programs as I could. My salary was too high to qualify but I think it’s something important that other people can look into.
Related: A guide to paying off your student loans
What can people learn from your experience?
The first thing is to really commit to getting out of debt. I was 100 percent committed. What I wanted was peace of mind and freedom from the worries.
I think that’s really the first step for everybody: to decide enough is enough.
That made it easy for me to make the decisions. To sacrifice on my car, to sacrifice on my housing.
Once you paid off your debt, what did you do with the money that was going to those monthly payments?
Every penny went toward my investing business. Then I eventually sold my foreclosure home and all of that money went toward my business. And that’s how I was able to build up my fortune so that I was able to leave the corporate world and travel around and do some pretty cool things. Really, investments became my number one goal after that.
One question I get most often from people is if they should prioritize paying down debt or if they should use their money to invest to save for a house or to invest in something that could grow over time. In your experience, what can you say to people about balancing those two?
If you have a 401(k) opportunity, you have to take advantage of that. It will save you one, on taxes. And two, if you get a corporate match that’s a great opportunity. Then the question becomes how much do you save? And I would say as much as you can and then some. It’s hard to do, but what it takes is making it automatic so that you don’t have to worry about it. Once it’s out of sight, once we don’t have that money to spend we find a way to get by.
The second priority is to attack that debt because it’s hard to get ahead until we’re out of debt. Whether it’s a mortgage or student loans or credit cards it doesn’t matter.
Start with a 401(k) then work toward the debt. And once you’ve cleared that debt then work on investing. I never reduced the payments toward my 401(k) or my IRA.
There’s a lot of emphasis now on making sure your college degree will lead to a job. Part of that debate is encouraging people to study science fields, or STEM. Is this something you thought about when you chose your major?
What I knew engineering school was going to do for me was open up some opportunities.
I would maybe push back a little bit with somebody who believes the major is the be all, end all. I’ve interviewed so many wealthy people and it’s interesting the careers they’ve gone on. They’ve either jumped from career to career or they’ve gone and done something different things from their major.
What I suggest to people is to look at where you want to go — and it changes — and what experiences you need to get there.
There’s a common set of experiences most people will want to kind of check off their list. Sales is something that is priceless. If you get sales experience it’s going to pay off in some way, shape or form. Another one is maybe operations, just understanding the flow of things. Another one is management. If you have understanding or at least experiences in those three you have the opportunity to do a lot of things.
It’s a way of using your career and experience as tools instead of what you “should” be doing.

Green concerns are raised to derail Indias developmental efforts: Anant GeetePer capita annual income increases in national capital
Union minister of heavy industries and public enterprises Anant Geete on Monday placed the blame of environmental imbalance on developed countries, stating that concerns over environment are often raised to derail India’s efforts to join the list of developed nations.
Speaking at the Express Tech Sabha in Hyderabad, Geete said, “The way we are concerned about environment, even the developed countries aren’t as concerned. I don’t think India can be held responsible for the imbalance in environment existing today. The developed countries are responsible.”
He added, “Now, when we try to carry out developmental works, there is an attempt to derail that in the name of environment. We are told that environmental balance needs to be maintained. We are not against that. But what is environment for? Environment has meaning only till human beings are alive, otherwise what is its meaning?”
“Our first responsibility is to ensure that people are able to survive. The situation is such that even today 70 per cent of our people live in rural areas… without basic facilities. We are not able to fulfill even their basic requirements. In such a situation, while we need to care for environment, we also need to ensure that we make efforts to realise our dream of being counted amongst the developed nations,” Geete said.

The RBI has been too cautiousThe RBI has been too cautious
A SESHAN
RBI Monetary Policy: Review by Satyanarayan Iyer
It is apprehensive about the global environment. However, its medium-term approach to inflation is to be welcomed
The Reserve Bank has decided to retain its policy rates and reserve ratios. Although favourable winds are blowing both domestically and globally, it does not want to take the risk of changing its course a few weeks down the line because of changed adverse circumstances.
The trends are partly favourable and partly not but their mixed nature has imparted a note of caution on the policy. But the basic question arises: How long can the bank wait for clear signals that can facilitate a relaxation in policy?
Unlike in the distant past, when economic trends were clear, the global economy now is complicated and integrated.
Trends can change so dramatically overnight due to the information revolution that the distinction between risk and uncertainty is no longer as reliable as in the past. The former is supposed to be measurable or for facilitating pre-emptive action while the latter is not.
Need to adapt
All that the central bank can do is carry out certain types of Monte Carlo exercises attaching arbitrary probabilities to the outcome based on the current knowledge to get an idea of where the economy is moving. Like many individuals in the world, the central bank has also to learn to live from day to day, adapting itself to changing circumstances. The policy of ‘When in doubt do not make changes in policy’ may not be always a wise course to adopt.
There were some interesting statements made, especially at the post-policy press meet of the RBI governor, Raghuram Rajan.
In the first place, a hope is held out that if the disinflationary process continues there could be a relaxation in policy early next year. What is more important is that there is a clear statement that the post-2016 inflation target of 4 per cent is acceptable to the government. This is refreshing after so much talk about a new normal of 6 per cent for inflation.
But the repeated emphasis on the base factor deciding the course of inflation is disconcerting coming as it does from the well-qualified and competent researchers of the econometric division, which this writer had the privilege of heading as its first director when it was shifted from the Department of Statistical Analysis to the Department of Economic Analysis and Policy.
Ridiculous stance
I have not seen any econometric study in internationally recognised and prestigious professional journals where the base effect is captured in an inflation model to know its influence on the general course of price rise.
In fact, it is ridiculous. If the base is high then it is a good thing for the future, for inflation rates may come down a year from now and hence no monetary policy needs to be adopted! If the index base is low now then it is bad because one year from now, ceteris paribus, inflation rate will be high. So action should be taken to raise the price rises in the economy!
Yet another satisfactory feature of the policy statement is the continued absence of any reference to the concept of core inflation, as applied in the West. There is only a sedate reference to “non-food non-fuel economy”. There are no references to any money supply and deposit targets that had relevance when monetarism ruled the day. It is no longer so now. There is a statement that a rise in investment is critical for a sustained pick-up in overall economic activity. This is true only for the future.
Today’s massive investments in infrastructural and industrial activities will bear fruit after several years. In the meantime, money would have been pumped into the economy without a commensurate rise in output in the immediate future, leading to inflation.
I discovered this in the course of a project appraisal study in the 1970s in Bellary district to advance loans to farmers for land reclamation with support from the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard). The lands were going to benefit from the massive Tungabhadra irrigation project after more than two decades. Local prices had gone up in the meantime.
So emphasis on massive investment in infrastructural projects to raise GDP is sound in principle. However, in view of the time-lags involved, the authorities should concentrate also on projects that are quick-yielding.
The Green Revolution was successful because of the massive minor irrigation programmes (for example, digging wells/tube wells) that took place in Punjab and other States within a short period.
Study the term interface
There is a statement that open market operations are undertaken not with a view to influencing long-term interest rates.
Still when buybacks of government securities take place the idea is to groom the market in favour of the gilts.
In the first few decades after Independence, there was an inverted yield curve with long-term loans fetching lower interest rates than short-term ones. The idea was to encourage lending for investment purposes.
With the reforms in monetary policy now, the rates are supposed to be market-determined. Can the RBI leave the long-term rates alone concentrating only on short-term rates?
The entrepreneur undertaking an investment will compare the internal rate of return with the rate of interest to find out whether it is worthwhile to go for a loan for the purpose.
In the US, the central bank concentrates on the short-term end of loans because market integration is complete and the changes in short rates will reflect in the long rates also. It is time the RBI undertakes a study to determine the interface between the short and long term rates to formulate a good policy.

What it means to be poor and disabledWhat it means to be poor and disabled
Jo Chopra
Tweet
THE HINDU The challenged But do we actually care for them? V GANESAN
Poverty indices must include disability as an indicator. That can change the way the world looks at the underprivileged
On World Disability Day, here’s a question to consider: how poor is poor? What factors go into deciding who is and who isn’t? And crucially, does disability make it more likely a person will be poor?
The Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative — a UK- based research organisation dedicated to reducing poverty — recently published a study on the multi-dimensional aspects of poverty and it’s more important than its bureaucratic description might lead you to believe.
Because two families can have the same income but drastically different standards of living, depending on education or health, just to name two critical factors.
And policy makers try to tease out which factor may be more important in reducing poverty overall: does improving access to water make the biggest difference or does it make more sense to educate children well?
How they have fared
The “Multi-Dimensional Poverty Index” is a list of just ten very specific questions, grouped in three categories. Education and Health get two questions each while Living Standard gets six.
In education, the indicators for poverty are that no one in a family has completed more than five years of school and/or that a school-aged child (6-14) is currently not attending school.
In health, if a married woman or a child under three is malnourished or a child under five has died, that family is predisposed to poverty.
In living standards, the predictable lack of electricity or drinking water are side-by-side with “Lives in a kacchaa house” or “Cooks with cow dung or crop husks.”
I was curious to see where disability came into the picture and was surprised (yet not) to find that it appears only obliquely. Since most children with disability do not go to school in India, their existence does figure as a factor in the education question, yet without awareness or analysis.
Similarly, since many, if not most, are malnourished, they would be counted as factors in the health questions too.
But this doesn’t even begin to do justice to the tumbling into poverty which disability almost guarantees for all but the most secure families.
My family is secure. In fact, I consider us reasonably well-off. Both my husband and I have jobs, we own a house (and it’s pucca), our kids have all attended school for many years and no one is malnourished.
Yet our daughter Moy Moy’s disability consumes more than 2/3 of my salary and most of my free time.
Were it not for the medicines, the tubes, the special feeds, the nebuliser, the wheelchairs, the diapers, the extra household help, the frequent illnesses her condition creates and the lack of spare time for me to pursue my writing as a second career, we might be rich.
The many shades of it
As long as neither of us has an unexpected crisis, we are lucky to be able to afford what Moy Moy needs to live a life of comfort and dignity while still maintaining our own health and well-being.
For most people, especially in countries like India, that simply isn’t possible.
Poverty is hard on everyone who lives in it, but for people with disability it is much worse.
What’s the point of that indoor toilet when you physically cannot get to it, no matter how close it is to where you are sitting.
Imagine hunger when you cannot feed yourself what limited food there is or if you cannot swallow. Try to picture yourself thirsty, on a hot day in June, with water on the table but with arms that don’t have the strength to lift the jug and pour it out.
We are incredibly lucky not to ever have to imagine these scenarios for Moy Moy.
But when I am dealing with a tube-feeding crisis (a simple bout of coughing sends her lunch flying all over the kitchen) or her severe constipation, I think about how it would be if – on top of all that we are already coping with – we were also poor.
A special need
The Multi-Dimensional Poverty Index should include disability as an indicator and the Government of India should take note.
Nearly 15 per cent of the world’s population, according to the World Health Organisation, live with special needs and are, by definition, predisposed to being poor.
They need more resources to achieve the same standards as typical people, yet they have fewer, if any, ways to earn. And they get very little understanding, let alone sympathy or support from their better-off fellow citizens.
Amartya Sen, on whose work the Poverty Index is based, comments: “It is amazing how smug and inactive most societies are about the prevalence of the unshared burden of disability, from which purely income-based views of poverty… only distract attention.”
The Multi-Dimensional Poverty Index is not purely income based, and that’s a promising step. But clearly we still have a lot more to do before we can understand the true nature of poverty.
On World Disability Day this year, let’s think it all the way through. It’s bad if you are poor. But if you are poor and disabled? Do the math.

Obamas pick to lead the Pentagon is big on cybersecurityBy Andrea Peterson December 2 Follow @kansasalps
According to administration officials, Pentagon official Ashton Carter is expected to be President Obama’s nominee to replace Chuck Hagel as U.S. defense secretary. (Reuters)
President Obama's pick to lead the Pentagon, former deputy secretary of defense Ashton "Ash" Carter ,  has been a big supporter of increasing the country's cybersecurity capabilities. His nomination signals that the administration is likely to continue to aggressively build out its ability to fight adversaries in the digital world.
Carter served as the deputy secretary of defense from October 2011 to December 2013 -- and before that spent two years as the Defense Department's chief weapon and technology buyer. He first joined the Pentagon as a civilian program and technical analyst in 1981, working on missile defense.
Carter has reportedly been influential in the reorganization of U.S. Cyber Command  over the last few years. Last year, the Pentagon announced plans to grow the force fivefold in the coming years as it faces increasing threats of online attacks from other state-level actors. In October, some White House networks reportedly were compromised by hackers thought to be working for the Russian government. Chinese government hackers are suspected of being behind recent breaches at the United States Postal Service and the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
At an Aspen Security Forum in 2013 , Carter called cyber security an area of "great importance" that the Defense Department was investing in despite budget cuts associated with sequestration. He also outlined the Pentagon's approach to cyber: defending the nation's government and private-sector networks while developing cyber capabilities to "nullify cyberadvantage on the part of others." This last part is essentially offensive cyber capabilities.
"It's a new field of warfare," Carter explained, noting that the Pentagon had to be cautious while determining how to proceed. "Obviously, we want to do things as we try always to do, in a way that is lawful and in a way that our population can support and is consistent with our values," he said.
Carter's prioritization of cyber security puts him in step with the Obama administration's focus on the issue. In 2012, the president signed a secret directive that reclassified some cyber actions previously considered offensive as defensive -- taking proactive action to disrupt perceived cyber threats.
At the Aspen forum, Carter suggested that society at large was "underinvested" in cybersecurity and that private companies needed to take more steps to protect themselves.  "A lot of our critical businesses are more vulnerable than they should be, and what should really happen is they should take the steps to harden themselves," he said. "And that's more important than us rendering aid, which, of course, we're prepared to do as we defend the rest of the country."
Carter comes from a science-heavy background: He has bachelor's degrees in physics and medieval history from Yale University and received his doctorate in theoretical physics from Oxford University.

Can political groups raise money for the mere idea of a woman presidentBy Nancy Scola December 2 Follow @nancyscola

ActBlue , the Democratic online fundraising powerhouse group, is asking federal election officials whether it can set up a system for allowing fundraising on behalf of a female presidential candidate before knowing who, exactly, the money would go to.
This is how it would work: Democrats would chip in $5, $10, $50, $100 for a generic, to-be-named female candidate. If, say, Hillary Clinton or U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren got the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, she would get whatever money had piled up.
But if, say, former senator Jim Webb was the Democrats' nominee instead, the accumulated money would revert elsewhere -- perhaps to a group like EMILY's List.
That cash could give a female candidate a little more incentive to run -- and the Democratic establishment a little extra motivation to rally behind a female candidate. That's ActBlue's hope, anyway.
"If someone has a strong preference for a woman, but not for one candidate over the other," says Steven Gold, ActBlue's general counsel, "this is a way they could express that preference." ActBlue executive director Erin Hill describes it as letting small-dollar donors shape the "marketplace" for candidates.
The nonprofit ActBlue has received FEC approval for other unusual fundraising strategies. The group was the first to establish "draft campaigns" to raise money for candidates who had not announced they were running. Warren, for example, had more than $100,000 in ActBlue -- collected donations waiting for her from one "Draft Warren" fund alone -- when she got into the 2012 race for the Senate.
Of course, gender can be a tricky thing. ActBlue told the FEC in its application that it "looks forward to the day when a transgender candidate mounts a viable presidential campaign, but for purposes of this opinion, we respectfully request that the Commission treat gender as though it is easily determined."
Founded in 2004, ActBlue has figured out how to use the Internet to extract vast sums of money from Democratic donors. Donations can be as small as a dollar, and the mean donation last election cycle was just $45, but ActBlue has managed to raise more than $680 million in its decade of existence. The platform's first great innovation was making it trivially easy for campaigns of any size to tap into state-of-the-art online fundraising technology and a networked base of ready donors. It's been pushing the boundaries of what's possible with small-dollar, digital donations ever since.
Republicans have tried to set up ActBlue equivalents over the years, but none have stuck.
The FEC declined to comment on ActBlue's application as the request is still pending.

Why your inbox is flooded with political e-mailComments
By David Karpf December 2

The election is over.  We all now get to enjoy a break from the relentless campaign commercials, the phone calls, the mail pieces, and the yard signs.  But the e-mails?  The e-mails won’t stop.  In the 2014 election, inboxes were flooded like never before . In 2015, the messages will just keep coming.
However, e-mail plays a different role outside election season.  During elections, e-mail is almost exclusively a fundraising tool .  The parties and electoral advocacy groups raise money from supporters, then funnel that money into broadcast television advertisements, which their supporters dutifully skip past with their TiVo or DVR.  In between elections, advocacy organizations still use e-mail for fundraising, but they also use it for passive democratic feedback, which they use to help determine priorities.
For all the talk about Twitter, Facebook, blogs, and YouTube, e-mail is still the single most important communication tool for political campaigns and advocacy organizations.  That’s primarily because e-mail is a “push” medium, while the others are all “pull” media.  An advocacy organization can send an e-mail to every one of its supporters and be confident that it will appear in their inbox. Tweets and posts on social media offer no such guarantee.
The other important thing about e-mail is that organizations can use analytics to track supporter responses.  Which headlines actually get supporters to read the e-mail?  Which subjects actually prompt supporters to take action?  Which issue areas lead them to unsubscribe from the list?  By monitoring these “open rates,” “action rates,” and “unsubscribe rates,” groups can form a rapid impression of public opinion among their supporter base.  Combining this passive democratic feedback monitoring with quick weekly online member surveys gives advocacy organizations an ongoing snapshot of what their members want them to do.  It’s a lightweight listening technique.
In my 2012 book, “ The MoveOn Effect ,” I describe how these digital listening tools allow organizations like MoveOn.org to quickly gauge member opinion as they roll out campaigns to influence public policy around issues like net neutrality, war in Syria, and health care reform. It is part of a broader change in “membership regimes” among advocacy organizations and broader civil society groups. It used to be that you decided to join an organization. In 2014, if you are on an advocacy organization’s e-mail list, then (congratulations!) you are a member.
This may comes as a surprise.  No one told you that, by signing that e-petition last month, you were joining Americans for Prosperity or MoveOn.org.  And membership used to require a lot more than just an e-mail address. Membership in advocacy organizations is a vanishingly thin relationship today.  But it’s also a nimble, active relationship.  Organizations can use analytics to “listen” to their members more effectively than they could when membership was maintained through the mail.
It wasn’t always this way.  The civic organizations of a bygone era built deep, thick associational ties with their members .  Participating in the Rotary Club, the American Legion or the Sierra Club meant showing up to a lot of in-person meetings and events.  Membership took a lot of time, and it also yielded a lot of social rewards.  Members formed friendships and developed leadership skills.  Civic associations served as “laboratories of democracy.”  They also provided the basis for the large-scale social movements of their day.  There was a lot of power in the relationships those civic associations built with their members.  But they were also time-consuming and demanded a lot of resources.
The in-person membership model wasn’t replaced by the Internet; it was replaced by direct mail.  Beginning around the early 1970s, many advocacy groups began defining the membership relationship around direct mail and canvassing.  For Public Citizen or Greenpeace, membership is defined by the act of donating.  (We used to deride these types of members as “armchair activists,” just as today we call online members “clicktivists.”)  The direct mail member was a reliable source of cash, and those reliable dollars helped create an infrastructure of lobbyists, researchers, and policy experts representing their issue publics in the nation’s capital. But the direct mail member was also divorced from the day-to-day operations of their civic association.  And direct mail members didn’t develop the shared identity and leadership skills that comes through interactions with fellow members.  Civil society organizations and their members have been mostly out-of-touch for over 40 years.
Now, with the shift to Internet-based membership, organizations are starting to develop new ways of listening to their supporters.  Communicating through the postal service is costly.  Communicating through e-mail is cheap.  And even though that cheap communication unleashes the unending torrent of messages into your inbox, it also puts organized advocacy groups in a position to measure supporter sentiment and take the will of their membership seriously once again.
Outside of election season, digitally-enabled advocacy organizations are launching campaigns to influence public policy and change our political culture.  E-mail has replaced direct mail as the bedrock of their membership model.  And they use that e-mail to listen more frequently to their members.  But it is still a relationship between the organization and members, not a relationship between members and each other. The question still remains whether 21st century advocacy groups can augment these thin online interactions with the types of deep, participatory engagement that characterized membership associations from decades’ past.
So during this pause between election seasons, take a look at your inbox and think about which organizations are speaking to you.  Unsubscribe from the ones you don’t care about, and respond a little more to the ones you do.

Twitter just overhauled its abuse-reporting policy. But is it enough to stop harassmentBy Caitlin Dewey December 2 Follow @caitlindewey
(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)
Even before Gamergate turned the network into  a veritable Ground Zero for Internet harassment, Twitter had been vowing to revamp abuse policies that made reporting too difficult for victims and left observers powerless to help besieged Twitter-friends.
Now, at last, it would appear the company has begun to make good on that promise: In a blog post Tuesday afternoon, Twitter’s Shreyas Doshi announced the site had streamlined its reporting process in several big ways, including making it easier for victims to report problems from mobile phones and letting third-party witnesses flag tweets on their behalf, too.
Previously when users tried to report abuse, they had to fill out a lengthy form — a particularly onerous task on a smartphone. That form is now shorter and quicker to complete.
Twitter has simplified its reporting process to a few quick taps. (Twitter)
Users can also now flag problematic tweets for review, even if the tweets weren’t directed at them. Twitter’s form used to ask your relationship to the abuse victim, and disqualify your report if you weren’t an authorized representative.
Twitter will now let you report harassment on behalf of another user. (Twitter)
These changes are critical for a couple reasons. While it’s been possible to block and report individual users for years, high-profile or divisive tweeters often face other types of abuse that the system doesn’t account for. If a user is swarmed by dozens of trolls, for instance, it’s difficult to block and report each one. If a blocked and reported user opens a second Twitter account to continue the harassment, the same problem arises. And when the organization Women, Action & the Media partnered with Twitter on an “unprecedented” initiative to research and address abuse, it raised a series of other issues Twitter policy didn’t address: things like networks of sock puppet accounts, and fake photos or quotes “from” the victim, circulated to drum up vitriol.
Per a recent report by the Pew Research Center, 40 percent of all Internet users have experienced harassment online. And on Monday, the Supreme Court began hearing its first case on threats made via social media ; it’s widely seen as a recognition of exactly how widespread and pressing the online harassment issue has become.
These latest tweaks won’t fix that problem entirely, of course: Alas, there’s no indication that Twitter is doing anything to staff up its moderation teams, which WAM faulted just last month, and there’s still nothing stopping a blocked troll from simply signing up for another Twitter account and continuing his campaign from there.
But these changes should make it easier for victims to push back against mobs of abusers, since they’ll be able to block them faster and with the help of friends. Twitter’s also promising more fixes in the future … as it’s done many times before.
“We are nowhere near being done making changes in this area,” Doshi promises. “In the coming months, you can expect to see additional user controls, further improvements to reporting and new enforcement procedures for abusive accounts.”

Intermission: Long voyagesBy Alyssa Rosenberg December 2 Follow @AlyssaRosenberg
Earlier today, I spoke to a group of Chinese officials about American popular culture  and got to listen to them talk about what’s big with Chinese audiences right now — the answer appears to mostly be reality television. One of the most interesting programs my fellow presenter described is a dating program called “If You Are The One,” which, like “The Bachelor” and “The Bachelorette” franchises here, involves contestants trying to find their perfect partners from a wide range of options. Whereas in the U.S. dating-to-marry shows are seen as slightly crass and scandalous, “If You Are The One” is striking, he said, because of how free the contestants were in expressing their emotions. It made me curious: have you ever enjoyed pop culture from another country in a way that was very different from the way its creators intended you to?

• “ Totally Obsessed ,” by Willa Paskin: Slate’s television critic looks through all of our enthusiasms and finds a common thread. It is not so much that we are actually blown away about whatever flavor of the week is big right now, but that we want to be able to identify ourselves by our affiliation with a particular cultural mania.
“It could be ‘Serial’—unless it’s ‘True Detective,’ the surprise album by Beyoncé, the first season of ‘Girls,’ the last season of ‘Breaking Bad,’ ‘Too Many Cooks,’ cronuts, or any of the other crazes that have possessed us in the last few years,” Paskin writes. “Though they feel like manias in and of themselves, they are all part of a larger fad: obsession itself. ‘Serial’ may be so hot right now, but being obsessed with cultural product ‘X’ is even hotter. Just check back in a month, when the ‘Serial’ craze is over, as fleeting as all the rest, and we are losing our minds over something else.”

“Clarkson’s song is inimitably 2004, but it would be just as at home in 2014,” he argues. “Big choruses and soft/loud dynamics have always been a crucial part of pop, but ‘Gone’ doubled down on those components. The verses hum along relatively quietly; the hook explodes; the result is arenas full of people jumping. Largely due to Martin and Luke’s influence, this kind of song has come to dominate the airwaves in the years since—and Clarkson got there long before Kesha, still rocking the dollar sign in her name, brushed her teeth with a bottle of Jack in ‘TiK ToK.’”
• “ The Long Run ,” by Anna Lisa Raya: Over at Deadline, Raya talks with Richard Linklater about “Boyhood,” the movie he made over a period of 12 years, which has emerged as a major Oscar contender.
“Embarking on something like this, you’ve got to really take a long-term view of what this project is and what it’s going to demand, so you need someone who would have the spirit and be all in. But I think a lot of it really is just their characters,” Linklater tells her of his casting process. “I knew Ethan [Hawke] well and saw him go from being a single guy to a parent. I thought he had a lot to say about parenting and would continue to. That is exactly what happened, and the same goes with Patricia [Arquette]. I had met her once and knew she had become a mom at a young age. I thought, she probably has something interesting to say about struggling with a career and parenting. When I called her up, we talked about just that for two hours. We just talked about being parents, being a kid, our own parents, and she just had so much to reflect on. It’s a deep well when you talk about parenting, so I just wanted people who would always have new things to say.”

“Already, Netflix has stumbled. Infrastructure issues like establishing payment systems for customers proved difficult in Latin America,” Steel explains. “And about a fifth of the company’s market value has evaporated since mid-October, after it disappointed investors with slower-than-expected subscriber growth that followed its September debut in France, Germany and other European markets.

Why the FDAs expected decision to end a ban on blood donations from gay men may fall shortBy Jason Millman December 2 Follow @jasonmillman
(AP Photo/Herald & Review, Danny Damiani)
The federal government may soon ease 31-year-old restrictions on blood donations from men who have had sex with other men, marking a big change in outdated federal policy.
The Food and Drug Administration met Tuesday to consider lifting a ban that dates back to 1983 amid fears — and little understanding — of the AIDS virus. An HHS advisory committee last month recommended that the agency lift the restriction, but only for men who hadn't had sex with other men for at least a year.
The scientific and medical communities have increasingly rejected the ban currently in place in the United States. The American Medical Association, the nation's largest physician organization, voted last year to oppose the ban, calling it discriminatory and not based on sound science. Instead, the AMA urged federal policymakers to take a more personal approach assessing each individual's level of risk.
The approach recommended by an HHS advisory committee last month falls short of that standard. And it still falls short of what a number of other countries have done to allow blood donations from gay and bisexual men.
Countries, such as Italy and Spain, use an individual risk assessment for all would-be donors, regardless of sexual orientation. Italy's blood donation policy, which has been in place since 2001, screens everyone for risk factors, like whether they've participated in prostitution, injected drugs or had multiple sex partners with unknown sexual behavior. The policy hasn't resulted in a significant increase in HIV-positive gay and bisexual male blood donors, according to a study released last year.
Mexico instituted a similar screening policy about two years ago. Russia in 2008 lifted its ban on donations from men who have sex with men, but government officials there last year suggested they could reinstate the ban after passing anti-gay laws.
Some are seeing the HHS advisory committee's one-year deferral recommendation as an easier transition from the current ban, which prevents men from donating blood if they've had sex with any man at least once 1977. Jay Menitove, a doctor who chaired the advisory committee recommending the one-year deferral policy, said it "can be looked at as a starting point."
"The sense was if we made a change, the incremental risk to the safety of the blood supply would be very, very low," Menitove told the Washington Post last week.
The science is much different today. Testing for donated blood is considered highly accurate and safe, though tests may not be able to detect HIV in someone newly infected with the virus — and that's been a concern raised by those opposing total elimination of the ban.
Australia made the switch to a similar one-year deferral policy almost 15 years ago, and there hasn't been any evidence that it resulted in a significant increase in the risk of HIV transmission, according to a 2010 study . Australia, Hungary and Japan all have one-year deferral policies, while South Africa's is six months for anyone who's had sex with a new partner.
Eliminating the ban on donations from gay and bisexual men would likely mean 360,600 new blood donors, while the one-year deferral policy would mean 185,800 likely new donors, according to an analysis from the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law. That wouldn't mean a major increase for the nation's blood supply — but it would mean the end of a discriminatory policy.

NASA prepares to test the spaceship that could take us to MarsBy Christian Davenport December 2 Follow @_chrisdavenport

As the last man to walk on the moon prepared to fly back to Earth in 1972, astronaut Eugene Cernan echoed the words of the first, pledging with Neil-Armstrong-like grandiosity that “we shall return, with peace and hope for all mankind.” He later predicted that humans would reach Mars by the end of the 20th century.
Now Cernan admits: “I was a little off on my timing.”
Forty-two years after Cernan’s Apollo 17 mission touched down, not a single person has walked on the moon. A Mars landing is surely decades away, at best. And not a single space ship designed to carry astronauts has left Low Earth Orbit.
But at 7:05 Thursday morning, NASA is scheduled to take what it calls a huge step toward advancing the nation’s human space flight program, with the much-anticipated first test flight of the Orion spacecraft .
If all goes according to plan, the uncrewed Orion, manufactured by Bethesda-based Lockheed Martin, would blast off from Cape Canaveral, Fla., orbit the Earth twice, hitting an altitude of about 3,600 miles above the surface of the planet. That’s farther than any spacecraft designed for humans has gone in more than 40 years.
Even though it is expected to last just 4.5 hours and won't have people on board, the test flight “is a big deal,” NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden has said. (“A BFD,” he reportedly told one audience recently . “Forty years!”)
William Hill, a top NASA official, recently told reporters that the test flight is “absolutely the biggest thing that this agency is going to do this year.”
Unlike the capsules being developed by SpaceX and Boeing that would ferry astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station, Orion is designed to go deep into space, “farther than humans have ever traveled,” according to NASA. The test flight alone would go 15 times farther than the space station.
But NASA and Lockheed have grander plans for the Orion, which resembles prior capsules such as the Apollo, but which officials say is vastly more advanced.
Sometime in the 2020s, NASA plans to capture an asteroid with a robotic spacecraft , then drag it to the moon’s orbit where it would connect with the Orion. Astronauts would then be able to take samples from the asteroid.
The big target, however, remains Mars. And Thursday’s test flight will help “put Mars within the reach of astronauts in the 2030s,” NASA says.
But the asteroid mission has been derided as a stunt—“That’s a dumb idea to start with. It’s nothing but talk,” Cernan said. The program for Mars has been fitful, and is to many a fantasy, especially considering that since the retirement of the space shuttle three years ago, the U.S. has not been able to send its astronauts to space from American soil.
“Forty-two years ago I walked on the moon,” Cernan said. “And today we can’t even put an American in space on American hardware. That’s heartbreaking. It’s disappointing. I cannot believe or imagine that we allowed this happen. … I anticipated we’d be well on our way, by golly, by now to Mars and there’s no reason we couldn’t have been.”

Orion originally grew out of a George W. Bush administration program, called Constellation, to return to the moon by 2020. The Obama administration killed Constellation and made Mars the priority over a return to the Moon because, as President Obama said at the time, “We’ve been there before.”
In the nearly 10 years since it first awarded Lockheed to contract to build Orion, NASA has spent more than $9 billion on the program. It also is developing what it calls a Space Launch System rocket that would take Orion to deep space in future missions. Thursday’s mission would use a Delta IV heavy rocket.
The cost of the SLS and Orion could grow to more than $30 billion, said Marco Caceres, a senior space analyst with the Teal Group consulting firm. There is a fair amount of opposition to the asteroid mission in Congress, and a Mars landing, some 20 years away at best, remains a dream.
“To make matters worse,” Caceres wrote in a recent blog , “is the painful fact that the rocket doesn’t actually have a mission.”
The Mars program is subject to funding constraints and a balky political system.
“This is the problem with anything that takes 20 years — people have very short attention spans,” Caceres said. “And you have numerous presidential administrations and Congresses, and inevitably someone gets around to canceling it, or reducing it.”
Still, the Orion test flight will be a huge day for NASA — and the Orion, which will face extreme conditions , from space radiation, to the 4,000 degree temperatures generated when it hits the atmosphere traveling at 20,000 mph.
NASA will launch its newest spacecraft, Orion, into space for the first time Thursday, on a flight that will take it farther than any spacecraft built to carry humans has gone in more than 40 years. (NASA)
The test flight “is basically a compilation of what I would say are the riskiest events that we’re going to see when we fly people,” Hill, the senior NASA official, told reporters.
There will be numerous “separation events” — the Launch Abort System, for example, and the crew module separation — that, Hill said, “have to work right the first time.” The heat shield will be put to an extreme test. And then there are the numerous parachutes that have to deploy correctly so that the capsule lands safely in the Pacific Ocean.
NASA is already looking ahead to Orion's next unmanned test flight in 2018, and the first manned flight in 2021 at the earliest. Mark Geyer, NASA's Orion Program Manager, said at a news briefing Tuesday that the long wait times are "budget driven."
"I wish it would go faster, but I think this is a good plan given the budget we've got," he said.
The October explosion of the unmanned Orbital Sciences rocket that was to supply the space station is hanging over the launch. So is the recent crash of the Virgin Galactic spacecraft that killed the co-pilot .
Those incidents “remind us that this business is very difficult,” said Mike Hawes, Lockheed’s Orion Program Manager.
Officials have done everything they can to “identify your risks and do everything you can to mitigate them. But you still fly with a level of risk.”
Geyer said he hoped “everything is perfect” and that there are “high-fives” all around after ward. But officials will be looking for the things that aren’t perfect, so they “can learn and fix it before we put people on board.”

Thanks to the Republicans  the nations least consequential policy fight is backBy Matt O'Brien December 2 Follow @ObsoleteDogma
We're fighting over the ... ExIm Bank? Really?  (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)
Good news for fans of unimportant policy fights: Paul Ryan thinks  Republicans will try to stop the Export-Import (ExIm) Bank from being reauthorized in 2015. Now feel free to go on living your lives.
The stakes don't get much smaller. The ExIm Bank, as you might guess, subsidizes exports for big manufacturers like Boeing by giving their customers cheap loans. It's probably not a good idea, but it's not a particularly bad one either. And as far as bad ideas go, it at least the virtue of making the government money. Specifically, the CBO estimates that it will add $14 billion to the government's coffers over the next decade. That's because the government can borrow for so little that it can even come out ahead on even subsidized loans.
Republicans, though, want to show that they're not the party of the rich ... just without spending any more money on the poor. (Indeed, as Jonathan Chait points out, they want to let low-income tax credits expire right now, but not the business ones). So Republicans have come up with something called "libertarian populism." It's basically deregulation that hurts the rich. The idea, of course, is that getting rid of corporate welfare is the way to show that they're really on the little guy's side.
And that's where the ExIm Bank comes in. It is without question corporate welfare. But it's not a lot of it. In all, its subsidies are worth about $2 billion the next 10 years. (That's how much money it would lose if the government couldn't borrow at the super-low rates it does). To put that in perspective, that's about 0.0009 percent of GDP over that time. Not even a rounding error.
Never has so little been fought over by so many for so long. The ExIm Bank's subsidies are insignificant. So are its profits. And the economy will have the same number of jobs with or without it—just maybe not manufacturing jobs. Getting rid of the ExIm Bank, in other words, might be a good idea, but it's not a good use of Congress' time. Indeed, if you were ranking policies by their importance, there's a strong case that this would be last. But that's part of the appeal of this particular fight. It's a mostly symbolic way of showing that Republicans are against "crony capitalism" without angering conservative voters, like they would if they, say, eliminated agriculture subsidies for wealthy farmers.
That's what makes the ExIm Bank the perfect legislative battle for a do-nothing Congress. It won't upset anyone over than Boeing's lobbyists, because nobody else cares about it. And it will give activists a new bright, shiny object to focus on during their Two Minutes of Hate of everything Washington. Even better, because so little is riding on the outcome, it doesn't really matter whether they win or lose the fight. In fact, Republicans might secretly prefer to lose it, because that would keep the issue alive, and continue to give themselves the illusion of a middle-class agenda.
The ExIm Bank is dead. Long live the ExIm Bank.

Rolling Stone whiffs in reporting on alleged rapeBy Erik Wemple December 2 Follow @ErikWemple
Protesters carry signs and chant slogans in front of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity house at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville last month. The protest was in response to the university’s reaction to an alleged sexual assault of a student detailed in Rolling Stone. (Ryan M. Kelly/The Daily Progress via Associated Press)
For the sake of Rolling Stone’s reputation, Sabrina Rubin Erdely had better be the country’s greatest judge of character. On Nov. 19, the magazine published Erdely’s story about a ghastly alleged gang rape at the stately Phi Kappa Psi fraternity at the University of Virginia. The victim, Jackie, was taken into a dark Phi Kappa Psi room in the early weeks of the 2012 school year and raped by seven men while her date, the pseudonymous “Drew,” and one other man provided “instruction and encouragement,” the story claims.
The story landed with tremendous impact, with the university suspending fraternities until January and a heap of media attention falling on Charlottesville. The alleged gang rape is under investigation by local police.
Asked on a Slate podcast what she cited as substantiation of the claims in the story, Erdely said, “I will just say that I found her story — I found her to be very credible.”
Responses to rape allegations have an ugly history in this country, one in which the accuser’s reputation and credibility end up on trial, while the perpetrators emerge unpunished. Reason magazine, for example, asks, “Is the UVA Rape Story a Gigantic Hoax?”  That’s a too-strong treatment hidden in the squishy confines of an interrogatory headline. Yet Rolling Stone bears a great deal of responsibility for placing the credibility of the accuser in the spotlight, thanks to shortcomings in its own reporting. Consider that:
* Erdely didn’t talk to the alleged perpetrators of the attack, as The Washington Post’s Paul Farhi has reported .
When asked repeatedly on that Slate podcast whether she’d interviewed the accused, Erdely sounded evasive. Here’s a rough transcript of the back-and-forth:
Slate DoubleX Podcast: Did they respond about this, did they deny it? What was their response to the allegations?
Erdely: There was never a need for a response until I stepped in apparently because it wasn’t until I started asking questions that the university put them under some kind of investigation or so they said. It was unclear to me whether there was actually an investigation. The university said that they were under investigation but when I spoke to the Phi Psi chapter and also to the Phi Psi national representative, both of them said that they were not aware of any kind of university investigation….
Slate: But did the boys say anything to you? The thing about it is that everybody in the story seems to know who they are…
Erdely: There’s no doubt that — people seem to know who these people are….I would speculate that life inside a frat house is a probably, you know, you have this kind of communal life where everybody is sort of sharing information…People are living lives closely with one another and it seems impossible to imagine that people didn’t know about this.
Slate: Did they try to contact you? Did you try and call them. Was there any communication between you and them?
Erdely: Yeah, I reached out to them in multiple ways. They were kind of hard to get in touch with because their contact page was pretty outdated, but I wound up speaking…with their local president who sent me an email and then I talked with their national guy who’s kind of like their national crisis manager –
Slate: But not the actual boys –
Erdely: They were both helpful in their own way, I guess. All they really said was, they both claim to have been really shocked by the allegations when they were told by the university. And they both said that this is a really tragic thing and if only we had more information we could look into it and that’s the end of that.
Those answers look bad for Rolling Stone. Perhaps Erdely didn’t understand what she was being asked — that is, whether she spoke with the actual alleged perpetrators themselves. She answers only the much different question of whether she spoke to fraternity management, a much less central matter.
This lapse is inexcusable: Even if the accused aren’t named in the story, Erdely herself acknowledges that “people seem to know who these people are.” If they were being cited in the story for mere drunkenness, boorish frat-boy behavior or similar collegiate misdemeanors, then there’d be no harm in failing to secure their input. The charge in this piece, however, is gang rape, and so requires every possible step to reach out and interview them, including e-mails, phone calls, certified letters, FedEx letters, UPS letters and, if all of that fails, a knock on the door. No effort short of all that qualifies as journalism.
* Witnesses aren’t named.
Following the alleged incident, Jackie emerges from the Phi Kappa Psi house and huddles with three friends, whose names are changed in the piece. Why the pseudonymous treatment for the friends? Perhaps they feared that being identified would provide clues to the complete identity of Jackie; perhaps they just don’t want to get involved; one of them, “Randall,” tells Erdely that he doesn’t want to be interviewed because of “his loyalty to his own frat.” And perhaps they also couldn’t speak to the events in the room because they hadn’t witnessed them — and that makes the outreach to the alleged perpetrators all the more critical.
The Erik Wemple Blog has requested an interview with Erdely, which Rolling Stone has declined, though Erdely did speak to Slate and to The Post’s Farhi. Separately, we asked for an answer to this question about the friends. Rolling Stone spokeswoman Melissa Bruno told the Erik Wemple Blog that “dozens” of Jackie’s friends were indeed interviewed — some were on the record, and some wanted to remain nameless because “they were concerned about retaliation on campus.”
In her comments to Slate, Erdely said, “I spoke to, you know, virtually, all of her friends to find out what she had told them at various points.” So the stories matched up? Erdely was asked. “Well, I found it to be very consistent,” she replied. Then why wasn’t this information included in the story?
* Erdely herself has started hedging on the account. She told Slate, “The degree of her trauma — there’s no doubt in my mind that something happened to her that night. What exactly happened, you know, I wasn’t in that room. I don’t know and I do tell it from her point of view.”
That’s not the mastery of material that you want from an investigative reporter. In comments to Farhi, Erdely noted: “[T]he gang-rape scene that leads the story is the alarming account that Jackie — a person whom I found to be credible — told to me, told her friends, and importantly, what she told the UVA administration, which chose not to act on her allegations in any way — i.e., the overarching point of the article. THAT is the story: the culture that greeted her and so many other UVA women I interviewed, who came forward with allegations, only to be met with indifference.”
In deference to Erdely, her reporting on the internal proceedings at the University of Virginia over sexual assault is helpful. A high point comes when Erdely writes about a trustees meeting in September: “Two full hours had been set aside to discuss campus sexual assault, an amount of time that, as many around the conference table pointed out, underscored the depth of UVA’s commitment. Those two hours, however, were devoted entirely to upbeat explanations of UVA’s new prevention and response strategies, and to self-congratulations to UVA for being a ‘model’ among schools in this arena. Only once did the room darken with concern, when a trustee in UVA colors – blue sport coat, orange bow tie – interrupted to ask, ‘Are we under any federal investigation with regard to sexual assault?’”
That said, Erdely has lost the ability to lecture others on the real story at hand. She and her editors, after all, placed the horrific gang-rape scene in the lede of their piece and seeded the rest of the narrative with its aftermath. People are justified in concluding that THAT is the story.
That said, when Erdley asserts that “something happened” on that night in September 2012, she rests on firmer ground. On-the-record comments come from Rachel Soltis, a suitemate of Jackie in 2012, who says, “At the beginning of the year, she seemed like a normal, happy girl, always with friends. Then her door was closed all the time. We just figured she was out.” Soltis is also quoted this way: “The university ignores the problem to make itself look better. They should have done something in Jackie’s case. Me and several other people know exactly who did this to her. But they want to protect even the people who are doing these horrible things.”
In a much-cited piece , Richard Bradley, a former editor at George magazine, writes of his skepticism of Erdely’s piece because it plays to our biases about fraternities and college men. Surely it does, but that consideration shouldn’t be held against it.
What should be held against it is its own flimsiness and the half-hearted attempts of Rolling Stone to report it. The publication says it didn’t name the perpetrators because Jackie is “so fearful of them. That was something we agreed on,” Erdely commented. That’s a compelling reason — to hold the story until Jackie felt comfortable naming them; or until she filed a complaint; or until something more solid on the case emerged. In explaining the origins of the piece to Slate, Erdely said, “I made contact with a student activist at the school who told me about the culture of the school…and then I asked her to put me in touch with other rape survivors and she had mentioned a bunch of people with different situations and she had kind of casually mentioned that she knew somebody who had been gang-raped.” When she chose her opening anecdote, that is, Erdely opted for a sensational and undocumented gang-rape case over other cases, which were perhaps more prosaic and documentable.
The last word goes to Rolling Stone, which sent us this statement:
The story we published was one woman’s account of a sexual assault at a UVA fraternity in October 2012* – and the subsequent ordeal she experienced at the hands of University administrators in her attempts to work her way through the trauma of that evening. The indifference with which her complaint was met was, we discovered, sadly consistent with the experience of many other UVA women who have tried to report such assaults. Through our extensive reporting and fact–checking, we found Jackie to be entirely credible and courageous and we are proud to have given her disturbing story the attention it deserves.
*The story alleges that the incident happened on Sept. 28, 2012.
UPDATE 4:35 p.m.: Rolling Stone has adjusted the statement to reflect the September incident.
The University of Virginia held a special meeting on Tuesday to discuss recent allegations of sexual assault that have rocked the campus. University President Teresa Sullivan said any systemic problems “must be rooted out.” (AP)

The federal government controls two-thirds of Utah  and its better that way  public lands groups sayBy Hunter Schwarz December 2 Follow @hunterschwarz

Public lands groups have come out in opposition to Utah taking over federally controlled land after a report commissioned by the state about the costs and benefits of purchasing and managing the land was released Monday.
“The new report is unrealistic and would threaten the future of hunting, fishing, and other multiple uses currently enjoyed on our public lands,” Joel Webster, director of the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership Center for Western Lands, said in a statement.
The federal government controls more than 35 million acres in Utah, or about 66.5 percent of land in the state’s borders. Most of it is managed by the Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service, and only Nevada has a higher percentage of state land managed by federal agencies.
“There’s no way Utah could afford to manage all those lands,” Bill Dvorak, a public lands organizer for the National Wildlife Federation, said in a statement. “Taxpayers would end up paying more for fewer services, and the countryside that supports hunting, fishing, and the rest of Utah’s $12 billion outdoor recreation economy would be damaged, closed off or sold to the highest bidder.”
The report’s authors “bend over backwards to be polite in their summary,” said Matt Lee-Ashley, a senior fellow for the Center for American Progress, in an e-mail, but the substance of the report “describes in plain terms just how costly and fiscally reckless this land grab scheme really is.”
According to the report, $331.7 million was generated on lands in Utah managed by the BLM and Forest Service in 2013. A transfer of the land from the federal government to the state could be profitable for Utah if certain conditions are met, including if oil and gas prices “remain stable and high” and if the royalty revenue share was increased from 50 percent to 100 percent, the report said.

New York hospitals staff finish 21 days of monitoring after treating the citys first Ebola caseBy Abby Ohlheiser December 2 Follow @abbyohlheiser

The staff members who treated New York City’s single Ebola patient have all passed the 21-day incubation mark without symptoms, the New York City Heath and Hospitals corporation announced Tuesday. The news comes on the same day that the World Health Organization declared Spain to be completely Ebola-free.
New York’s first and only Ebola case,  Craig Spencer, left Bellevue hospital in New York on November 11 after a successful treatment for the Ebola virus. The physician contracted the illness while working in West Africa to treat Ebola patients. More than 100 New York City Health and Hospitals Corp. staff members treated Spencer. All of them had to complete a 21-day monitoring period for signs of the illness. “I’m pleased to announce that all HHC employees who directly cared for Dr. Spencer have safely passed the 21-day monitoring period and have been cleared of risk for this deadly infection,” HHC President Dr. Ram Raju  said in an e-mailed statement.
The news effectively eliminates the possibility that Spencer transmitted the virus to others after returning from West Africa earlier this year. Before his diagnosis, Spencer monitored himself for Ebola symptoms upon his return from Guinea, but was not quarantined. He was eventually admitted to Bellevue Hospital in late October with a 100.3-degree fever, and tested positive for the virus . The diagnosis prompted a heated debate over proposed measures to quarantine medical workers returning from West Africa for 21 days, or the maximum length of time it can take for someone who is infected with Ebola to become symptomatic.
That debate intensified with the news that Spencer traveled on multiple subway lines — and went to a Brooklyn bowling alley — the night before he became symptomatic. At the time, health officials assured New Yorkers that the chance that Spencer had passed on the illness, which is spread by direct contact with bodily fluids of a  symptomatic individual, was very slim. Spencer is the only medical worker to be diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S. after treating patients in Africa, although several other medical workers have traveled to the U.S. for treatment following an Ebola diagnosis abroad.
Spencer is the U.S.’s fourth Ebola case. Two Dallas nurses were treated for the disease after treating a Liberian man who became symptomatic after traveling to Texas. The man, Thomas Duncan, later died of the virus . Duncan sought treatment from a Dallas hospital with symptoms of the virus days after arriving in Texas. However, Duncan was sent home , only to return days later with more advanced symptoms. He was then diagnosed with Ebola. Both nurses who treated Duncan recovered from the disease. Neither transmitted the virus to anyone else .
The U.S. now has no known cases of Ebola. However, the World Health Organization won’t be quite ready to officially declare The U.S. Ebola-free: The public health organization waits until double the length of the 21-day monitoring period for all contacts of an Ebola patient before doing so.
That period has passed for the contacts of a health-care worker in Spain who contracted the virus from an Ebola patient who was treated in Madrid. The nurse tested negative for the disease 42 days ago, the WHO said in a Tuesday release. Health officials monitored 87 contacts of the nurse for signs of the illness, and placed 15 high-risk contacts under quarantine for 21 days. That’s in addition to the more than 100 health-care workers who came into contact with the nurse, WHO said. All were monitored; none became symptomatic. “WHO commends Spain for the measures put in place to identify potential cases and prevent further transmission of the Ebola virus,” the organization said in a statement .
As Western countries with Ebola cases recover from the virus, the situation is less optimistic in Western Africa, which is  battling an Ebola epidemic. This week, Doctors Without Borders released an assessment of the fight against Ebola in the region. The health group wrote that the international response has been “too slow,” “encumbered by serious bottlenecks in terms of staffing,” and from a serious lack of “adequate facilities in which to diagnose and care for patients” in the hardest-hit regions.
The World Health Organization missed a goal it set in October to isolate 70 percent of Ebola cases by the beginning of December. Just one of the hardest hit countries, Guinea, met the goal.
Overall, there are more than 16,000 total cases of Ebola in countries with intense transmission, and nearly 6,000 deaths, according to the latest available figures .

Why Americans are loading up on cars againand paying moreBy Michael A. Fletcher December 2 Follow @Fletchpost
It's all about SUVs and big trucks. (REUTERS/Mike Blake)
These are good times for auto makers. Sales are soaring and new car shoppers, encouraged by low gasoline prices , rock-bottom interest rates and an improving job market , are going for bigger vehicles with more options. All of which means heftier price tags on new cars.
The numbers are still coming in, but analysts believe car makers had their best November in more than a decade. Chrysler’s sales rose 20 percent to nearly 171,000 vehicles, the company reported Tuesday. General Motors, Volkswagen and Toyota also reported gains. TrueCar has forecast that U.S. auto sales for November will total 1.3 million--an increase of 4.1 percent from the same month a year earlier.
The best part for car makers is that transaction prices are also increasing, which analysts say reflects the increasing popularity of large trucks and SUVs. Low gas prices are making those vehicles more palatable for shoppers. Buyers are also being helped by low interest rates, which allow them to finance more expensive cars for longer periods of time without feeling the financial pinch.
“Both of these factors reduce the near-term, out-of-pocket costs buyers spend on a new vehicle,” said Karl Brauer, a senior analyst with Kelley Blue Book. “If it sounds like there’s a potential downside to this situation, well, there is. People are still spending a lot, relatively speaking, for their new cars, but it doesn’t feel like a lot because it is spread out over six or seven years.”
So far this year, the average transaction price for a new vehicle sold in the U.S. has been $32,415—up $325 from last year, according to Kelley Blue Book. Overall, prices have been on the rise for the past decade—except for 2008 and 2009 when auto sales tanked during the recession.
But once the downturn ended, people started spending more as they bought bigger autos. Since 2009, the proportion of new vehicle sales attributed to trucks and SUVs has jumped from 43.4 percent to 49.1 percent, Kelley Blue Book said.
So far this trend is a boon for auto makers. It can also work well for consumers--assuming they hold to their new cars until they are paid off. "As long as buyers keep the car for the entire loan length, and as long as they get a low interest rate, it's not a terrible way to get a new car," Brauer said. "But if they switch vehicles in the first four to five years after a purchase, or if they pay a high interest rate, it's going to be a costly purchase."

Why hands up  dont shoot struck a chordBy Jonathan Capehart December 2 Follow @capehartj

Five members of the St. Louis Rams have been catching hell since their “hands up, don’t shoot” gesture on Sunday protesting the killing of unarmed teenager Michael Brown by Ferguson, Mo., police officer Darren Wilson in August. Last week, a grand jury declined to indict Wilson, who resigned from the force over the weekend. Why “hands up” has become a symbol for Ferguson can be found in the witness interviews conducted by law enforcement.
According to a chart compiled by the smart folks at PBS NewsHour, 12 of the 21 witnesses interviewed by St. Louis County police or the FBI said that Brown had his hands up when fired upon. Six of the 21 witnesses gave multiple interviews. Four of them were steadfast in their “hands up” recollection in both interviews. One was not asked about the hands in a follow-up phone call . And another didn’t mention hands at all in either interview .
Witness 14. Interview 1: “And when he turned to face the officer he raised his hands. But he didn’t raise them all the way up. He raised them up and looked and you could see that something was on his hands and he looked down like he was looking at his side . . .”
Witness 14. Interview 2: “Michael turned around to face him and he had his hands shoulder high just a little bit about his shoulders but they were out away from his body.”
Witness 16. FBI Interview: “I heard another shot fired while they were running. After that, he then turn, had his hands in the air, by the time that I saw him have his hands in the air, he got shot . . .”
Witness 16. Interview 2: “Yes, ’cause he [Wilson] was shootin’ as he was running. . . . That’s why he [Brown] turned around and put his arms up in the air and then got closer and shot him.”
Witness 22: “I saw the young man grabbing his, either his stomach or his side and had it…then he put his hands up and then the man just keep aiming…um…firing and then that was it.”

Witness 35: “Police cruiser was right, police cruiser was right behind him and Michael Brown was right there with his hands up and the officer was in front of him, like he got out of his car.”
Witness 37: “. . . and before I knew it, the officer got out, kinda gave him a chase, and that’s where I see Mr. Brown slow up and throw up his hands.”
Witness 41. Interview 1: “And um, Michael Brown’s on his knees with his hands up and he was being shot up.”
Witness 41. Interview 2: “Like I said, the only part I saw the boy was on his knees and he had his hands up and I saw the back of him and the police walking toward him and the gun said ‘click, click.’ That’s all I saw.”
Witness 42: “Right, so I seen him running and I, I heard another gunshot ‘pow’ and Mr. Brown turn around and put his arms up.”
Witness 44. Interview 1: “When he turned around he took about a step back then he put his hands up basically like I’m done. Arrest me. You know.”
Witness 44. Interview 2: “Cuz he was a big dude, and he was kinda hunched forward like he was in, with his hands up, like he was in give up, you know, ‘I’m givin’ up’ stage.”
Witness 45 : “Then when he turned back around with his hands up, to go back towards the police, that’s…go…third, fourth, fifth, sixth shot.”
Witness 46 : “And he put his hands up. And that’s when I seen the policeman got out of the car and started shootin’ again.”

Witness 48. Interview 1: “He was still down the street, he was running back, he like did like, he put his hands up for a few seconds and then put his arms down and he kind of put them close to his chest and he started running.”
Witness 64. Interview 2: “When he turned around his hands were up. . . . And as he came back towards the officer they may have stayed up briefly and then he went down.”
Twelve variations on the same theme: Brown had his hands up in some manner in the confrontation with Wilson. That’s what they said they saw to investigators. And that’s why “hands up” has become a symbol. The universal symbol for surrender wasn’t enough to save an unarmed person’s life.

NBC Newss chief medical editor returning to airwavesBy Erik Wemple December 2 Follow @ErikWemple
Dr. Nancy Snyderman, the NBC News doctor-slash-reporter who broke a voluntary quarantine in October following a trip to West Africa, is returning to the network’s airwaves tomorrow after an extended absence. She’ll appear on the “Today” show, a Fortune story reported first ; an NBC News source confirmed it to the Erik Wemple Blog.
Snyderman was a big deal on this blog approximately five major stories ago. She had traveled to Liberia to cover the Ebola epidemic when a freelance cameraman for NBC News, Ashoka Mukpo, was diagnosed with the disease (he later recovered at a medical facility in Nebraska). Following that diagnosis, Snyderman and other crew members were flown to the United States, where they were to observe a voluntary quarantine for 21 days. Except that Snyderman broke the deal, driving to the Peasant Cafe in Hopewell, N.J., near her residence. Planet Princeton, a local blog, busted her out for the violation, embarrassing the network and forcing Snyderman to issue one of those famous media near-apologies .
Following her violation, the quarantine became mandatory. When it concluded, NBC News issued a statement saying, among other things, that Snyderman and the others would “take some time off with their families and friends to help restore some normalcy to their lives.” That was in late October; it’s now early December. Snyderman should be coming back with a whole bunch of normalcy.
Not to mention a mellower news environment. When reports of her quarantine violation broke, the country was in the throes of Ebola hysteria, under which folks who’d traveled to affected areas were being disinvited from events and Fox News host Bill O’Reilly was stumping regularly for ruinous travel bans. When asked about Snyderman’s quarantine violation on Oct. 14, CDC Director Tom Frieden said simply, “If she was not sick, she was not putting others at risk.” Correct, as it turns out.

Nationals tender contracts to all 10 arbitration-eligible playersBy James Wagner December 2 Follow @jameswagnerwp

Ahead of Tuesday night’s deadline , the Nationals tendered contracts to all 10 players eligible for arbitration, including infielder Danny Espinosa and left-hander Ross Detwiler, two players who had questions about their status. Aside from Espinosa and Detwiler, the group of players also offered contracts includes Jerry Blevins, Tyler Clippard, Doug Fister, Jose Lobaton, Wilson Ramos, Craig Stammen, Drew Storen and Stephen Strasburg.
Detwiler was a candidate, though an unlikely one, to be non-tendered after a season during which his role diminished — from being inserted into the bullpen to being used sporadically and pitching inconsistently to being left off the playoff roster — and because he was projected to make more than $3 million to be a reliever who didn’t appear to have the Nationals’ trust. He had a 4.00 ERA last season.
But General Manager Mike Rizzo recently said he envisions using Detwiler in the same role as last season, and by preventing him from becoming a free agent, the Nationals ensured they have the option of trading him. Also, should the Nationals trade any of the starters who have one year of control left and haven’t inked long-term deals — Fister and Jordan Zimmermann — Detwiler could serve as starting depth.
Espinosa also struggled last season, hitting .219 and striking out 122 times in 333 at-bats. Despite an inconsistent bat, the Nationals need Espinosa because, as of now, he is the team’s only second baseman. (Anthony Rendon, who also can play second, will play third base next season.) The Nationals are looking for a second baseman this offseason. Should they fail to find one, Espinosa could man the position. If not, he could serve as a backup middle infielder with strong defense, a role he filled much of last season. Espinosa is projected, according to MLBTradeRumors.com’s arbitration calculator, to make $2.3 million in his first season of arbitration.
Although Blevins posted a 4.87 ERA last season, the highest among the Nationals relievers, he was tendered a contract because he is tough against left-handed batters, finished the season strong and comes at an affordable price (a projected $2.2 million). He and Detwiler are entering their final season of arbitration.
The Nationals’ large group of arbitration-eligible players is expected to make around $49 million next season. Players file for arbitration by Jan. 13, and three days later, teams and agents exchange salary figures. If a player and team can’t settle on a number, they go to an arbitration hearing in early February. (Bryce Harper also could be eligible for arbitration pending a potential grievance hearing with the Nationals this month about a disputed opt-out clause.)

Landrieu extremely disappointed with DSCCBy Sean Sullivan December 2 Follow @WaPoSean

BATON ROUGE, La. -- Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) lobbed a barb at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Tuesday, saying they effectively abandoned her after the Nov. 4 midterm election.
"I am extremely disappointed in the Democratic Senatorial [Campaign] Committee. I've said that. You know, they just walked away from this race," Landrieu said in response to a Washington Post question about Democratic groups mainly staying on the sidelines during the runoff. She made her remarks after a rally here just steps from City Hall.
The DSCC canceled its television ad reservations shortly after the Nov. 4 midterm election in which Democrats lost control of the Senate.
Landrieu advanced to a runoff against Rep. Bill Cassidy (R) in the Nov. 4 all-party primary. Save for limited ad buys from a handful of groups totaling about $216,000, Landrieu has had to face millions of dollars worth of pro-Cassidy ads on her own. The National Republican Senatorial Committee alone is on pace to spend more than $1.4 million on ads, records show.
A DSCC spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Landrieu, who most close watchers see as a clear underdog in Saturday's runoff, credited her Senate colleagues for helping her, even as the national campaign arm left her behind. Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) have recently campaigned for her here in Louisiana.
"My colleagues have not walked away," she said.

Postgame: Again  Caps killed by penaltiesBy Alex Prewitt December 2 Follow @alex_prewitt
The Canucks celebrate after beating the Capitals, 4-3, on three power-play goals (AP Photo/Alex Brandon).
The Washington Capitals had been shipped into the penalty box alone four times, allowed power-play goals three times for the second straight game and dropped their fourth in five, so now they tried — and struggled — to pinpoint what went wrong.
The pivotal moments in Tuesday night’s 4-3 loss to the Vancouver Canucks unfolded almost exclusively with someone parked behind glass,  much as they had done Saturday in Toronto. Troy Brouwer’s holding penalty turned into Daniel Sedin’s fifth goal of the season, which tied his franchise’s all-time mark for power-play scores. Jay Beagle’s hooking penalty became a 3-1 deficit, thanks to Radim Vrbata. Then, in the third period of a tie game, Nate Schmidt’s pass went over the boards, so a delay-of-game penalty ushered Sedin’s record-breaking score, and the night’s winner to boot.
“It’s a pretty meat-and-potatoes type thing,” goaltender Braden Holtby said. “A lot of it has to do with tying up sticks in front, my rebound control, my ability to see through traffic. Just those little things are starting to drift away a bit, and we’ve got to find a way to grab ahold of them and make sure we’re making it hard on other teams.”
Instead, the Canucks and Toronto Maple Leafs each found three power-play goals over the past two games. Instead, the Capitals’ penalty kill allowed its eighth goal over 13 tries. Instead, they were baffled as to why and how.
“Not one thing in particular that’s happening,” defenseman Matt Niskanen said. “We’re giving up goals on the penalty kill in different ways. … We tried to address a few things after the Toronto game. I think there were different types of stuff. It’s tough, though. It’s tough to win a hockey game when you give up three.”
It was also tough when the Sedin twins treated the penalty killers like puppets, going up 2-1 midway through the second period on a perfect cycle behind the net. After Henrik Sedin baited Verizon Center into booing because he held the puck for so long, Vrbata skipped a pass back to him. While the Capitals trained their attention into the corner, Daniel Sedin dove toward the net, unmarked.
“It’s something we pre-scouted and I need to play that better, knowing that play is coming,” Holtby said.
Holtby had little chance on Vrbata’s rebound goal, because defensemen Brooks Orpik and John Carlson both slugged at the puck and whiffed the cool rink air. The puck kicked off Carlson’s skate, trickled past Orpik’s flailing stick and went straight to Vrbata on the weak side.
“You start with the goaltending; it’s got to be your best penalty killer,” Coach Barry Trotz said. “That’s where it starts, and then it goes from there. Tonight I couldn’t blame Braden on anything. I thought he was pretty solid. They executed. You look at the goals, they’re second-chance goals where pucks are bouncing, couldn’t get a handle on it, they’re able to whack it in.”
Except for the last goal, which Trotz later claimed few goaltenders ever could have stopped. A failed breakout attempt, always risky when shorthanded, left Daniel Sedin streaking down the left wing. Just inside the faceoff circle, Sedin cocked back and swung, mid-stride. The puck buzzed across Holtby’s body and into the top-right corner.
The Capitals hounded Vancouver goaltender Ryan Miller for almost two minutes once Holtby vacated the net during the third period, but Sedin’s second goal held up. They had erased a 3-1 deficit, gotten two goals from Carlson and celebrated Brooks Laich’s first goal since mid-March. But, for the second straight game, they packed up and left the locker room thinking about penalty kills gone awry.
“At any given time, we’ve just got to be more ready,” Carlson said. “We prepare really well. We don’t have an issue of that. It’s definitely a little bit of communication maybe, a little bit of teamwork to maybe squash some plays, but the bottom line is we played a good game and we didn’t give ourselves a chance to win because of it. Something needs to change.”

7 countries where you can become a citizen or resident -- if you have the cashBy Rick Noack December 3 Follow @rick_n
In this photograph taken on January 25, 2013, stateless Arabs, locally known as bidoons, hold signs demanding Kuwaiti citizenship during a demonstration in Jahra, 31 miles northwest of Kuwait City. (YASSER AL-ZAYYAT/AFP via Getty Images)
As countries in the Middle East and Europe struggle with a surge in refugees and the United States debates immigration reform, the oil-rich kingdom of Kuwait is pursuing an unusual solution to a similar problem. It  announced  last month that it would offer citizenship to tens of thousands of stateless people from nomadic Bidoon tribes -- but not Kuwaiti citizenship.
Instead, Kuwait is planning to pay the impoverished African island nation of Comoros -- hundreds of miles away -- to grant Kuwait's stateless Arabs citizenship. Under the arrangement, the new citizens of Comoros would be allowed to stay in Kuwait, where they would benefit from free education, health care and employment opportunities, according to Al Jazeera .
The deal is possible because of Comoros's Economic Citizenship Act, passed in 2008, which allowed the country to sell its nationality to foreigners. Comoros has not commented on the Kuwaiti plan, nor has it publicly declared the price of nationality per individual.
But the incentive for the island nation is fairly clear: According to NGO Freedom House , Comoros might already have generated $200 million for selling its nationality to citizens of Gulf countries -- money the country's former president, Ahmed Abdallah Sambi, was alleged to have misused. The details of the case are sketchy, but they pointed to the existence of a larger program to sell passports to various other countries or individuals.
For Kuwait's interior ministry, the Comoros plan could be the solution to a longtime struggle between the Bidoon and the government. For decades, about 100,000 Bidoon tribe members have claimed to be Kuwaiti citizens; the Kuwaiti government considers them illegal immigrants.
But human rights groups say it's a terrible idea: As citizens of a foreign country, they note, the Bidoon Arabs would have fewer rights than if they remained stateless. The 1954 U.N. Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons is supposed to prevent the exclusion and marginalization of stateless people, and it demands states issue identity and travel documents to them. Kuwait would prefer to avoid such requirements.
In any case, if the Kuwaiti plan goes through, Comoros would hardly be the first country that has essentially sold citizenship or residency as a means to pad state coffers.
Many countries dangle residency to attract foreign investors, though they require large amounts of money and the permits are difficult to obtain. Among the countries that have established such programs are Australia, Belgium, Spain, Singapore, Britain, Portugal as well as the United States.
The following countries have made the process particularly easy, and some even offer full citizenship -- not to mention warm waters and white beaches.
Hungary

In 2012, lawmakers adopted an amendment to the immigration law that allowed foreigners to gain Hungarian investment citizenship (comparable to a permanent residency) if they were willing to buy at least $322,600 worth of special government bonds, according to Reuters . Unlike other European countries, Hungary does not require investors to purchase real estate or be physically present in Hungary for a certain amount of time.
For rich investors, this might be a lucrative deal: Hungary is part of the European Union, and every citizen is allowed to travel to other member states. The profits could also help lower the country's foreign currency debt, which is worth billions of dollars.
Malta

This Mediterranean island nation, south of Sicily, is also trying to use its EU membership to attract rich investors, who must  pay $1.57 million for one citizenship. In 2013, Malta originally announced it would sell citizenship for $865,000, but it raised the price after opposition protests. The outrage also led to other requirements and limitations: Future Malta citizens now need to reside on the island, and the program is capped at 1,800 passports.
Cyprus

Buying citizenship in Cyprus is more expensive --  $6.2 million for individuals and $2.48 million for those investing as part of a larger group , although the price was originally even higher and amounted to $34 million . Due to limited interest, the required investment was lowered.
The program primarily targets Russian investors who were particularly struck by a 2013 E.U. bank bailout for Cyprus, in which many foreigners lost large amounts of their investments. Shortly afterward, the country lowered citizenship investment requirements for those who had lost  their cash.
Dominica
The official government W eb site of Dominica offers a guide for those interested in investing in the country and receiving citizenship in return. Individual applicants have to pay $100,000; applicants with a spouse are expected to pay $175,000. Everyone "must be of outstanding character," according to the Web site. But they needn't actually live in the country.
Dominica also does not hide the real intentions of its program, which it wonkily describes as one component of its national capital mobilization portfolio towards its ultimate goal of national development." In 2013, Dominica had more than $500 million in external debt.
St. Kitts and Nevis

The citizenship application for St. Kitts and Nevis, a two-island country in the Caribbean, consists only of three pages. The blank space applicants are asked to fill outlining their "reasons for desiring citizenship" is only half the size of the "proposed source of income" and "approximate annual income."
Prospective citizens can either invest a minimum of $400,000 in real estate or make a $250,000 donation to the country's Sugar Industry Diversification Foundation.

A similar program exists in Antigua and Barbuda, located east of St. Kitts and Nevis. Future citizens can choose between a $400,000 real estate investment and a $200,000 charity donation. Opponents have said it might be exploited by terrorists or criminals, the  BBC  reported. But former prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda Baldwin Spencer knocked that down in a recent speech, saying that the Antigua and Barbuda Citizenship by Investment Program was "not an open-sesame for all and sundry."
Grenada

This Caribbean country requires potential citizens to invest a minimum of $311,750 into shares of a variety of companies operating in Grenada. The required investment includes legal, government as well as passport fees. Unlike some other nations that put a strong emphasis on financial resources in their application material, Grenada encourages investors to explore the beauty of Grenada. On the investment program's Web site , the government praises its own country: "And oh….! the charm and friendliness of these wonderful people just makes the difference!"

The economic recovery finally shows signs of registering ... a few weeks too late for DemocratsBy Aaron Blake December 3 Follow @aaronblakewp

Don't look now, but four weeks after the 2014 election, people are starting to notice the economic recovery.
In the run-up to Election Day 2014, economic optimism was in short supply for Democrats eager to capitalize on a succession of strong jobs reports and a thriving stock market. Through it all, Americans just weren't ready to believe the recovery was actually happening -- or at least that it was happening for them personally.
That's largely still the case, but it also appears to be starting to change in some small ways.
Witness:
1) A new Gallup poll on Tuesday showed its Economic Confidence Index virtually matching the post-recession high, at -8 . This measure, despite month after month of 200,000-plus jobs created in advance of the 2014 election, hadn't really budged.
2) The same Gallup poll showed daily consumer spending also nearing a post-recession high, at $95.
3) A CNN/Opinion Research poll last week showed, for the first time since the recession, a majority of Americans believed that things were going at least "fairly well" in the United States.
4) The same poll showed another post-recession first, with more people thinking the economy was improving than getting worse (though a plurality still believed it was static).
5) And we can't help but think that a lot of the above has to do with this: gas prices . They also just hit -- you guessed it -- a post-recession low.
NASDAQ
Even as these measures tick toward post-recession bests, though, plenty of other indicators lag. When you ask people whether they are satisfied with the conditions in this country or whether they think it's on the right track, you'll still get an overwhelmingly negative response.
In addition, the charts above show plenty of peaks and valleys, and the current peaks could be fleeting. Especially if gas prices hike back up, economic confidence is quite likely to take a hit.
But even these sorts of isolated good-news indicators were largely absent in the final weeks of Democrats' arduous 2014 campaign. And that certainly hurt Democrats, given that the occupant of the White House is one of their own.

A digital facelift for urban streetscapesBy Dominic Basulto December 3 Follow @dominicbasulto
New York City plans to replace its aging phone booths with futuristic new WiFi pillars starting in 2015. (CityBridge/LinkNYC)
As part of a broader vision to make cities smart, connected and environmentally sustainable, innovators are working on creative ideas to update the urban streetscape — think trashcans , street lamps, bicycle counters , bus stops and parking garages  – for today’s digital lifestyle. Case in point: a new plan from New York City announced this month to transform the city’s outdated pay phone booths into a citywide network of 10,000 futuristic pillars that will give New York City residents and tourists free, super-fast and reliable Wi-Fi coverage.
1. New York City’s WiFi pillars
New York City’s new Wi-Fi “Links” are coming to residential neighborhoods like this one in Brooklyn. (CityBridge/LinkNYC)
The Mayor’s Office of Technology and Innovation has partnered with a consortium of tech companies known as CityBridge to radically transform the city’s streetscape. By the end of 2015, CityBridge plans to replace the city’s outdated public pay phones with 400 super-thin Wi-Fi “Links”  capable of delivering Gigabit Wi-Fi speeds to New Yorkers. And within a few years, that number could reach as high as 10,000 Wi-Fi “Links” located throughout the five boroughs , including many in residential neighborhoods.
According to CityBridge , each “Link” will also offer residents the ability to charge digital devices, look up directions on touch screens, and provide civic feedback on specific issues. New Yorkers will also be able to make free phone calls anywhere within the United States. And best of all, these WiFi “Links” won’t cost city taxpayers a dime — the plan is to serve up ads on the Wi-Fi pillars, transforming citywide WiFi into a free municipal service subsidized by advertising sponsors. Over the first 12 years of operation, says CityBridge , this network will generate over $500 million in advertising-related revenue.
2. Boston’s device-charging park benches
The soofa is a solar-powered, device-charging park bench that promises to create new types of social experiences in Boston. (Soofa.co)
In a first-of-its-kind rollout, Boston is now experimenting with a new form of mobile experience: a dozen solar-powered park benches placed in select parks, playgrounds and sports fields throughout the city . By converting this solar power into electricity, these “Soofas” offer charging capabilities for multiple digital device owners, making them a social experience for mobile users as much as a technological experience. This “smart urban furniture” idea, which originally started as a project by the MIT Media Lab before being spun off as the company Changing Environments , is so creative that it was even featured at this year’s White House Maker Faire in June.
Eventually, say the three co-founders of Changing Environments, the plan is to expand the network of Soofas to build a smart energy infrastructure that collects urban data and informs citizens and city planners about everything from air quality to noise level by connecting to the Internet. In a statement about the launch of Soofas,  Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh  pointed to the potential of smart benches for Boston: “Your cell phone doesn’t just make phone calls, why should our benches just be seats?”
3. Singapore’s supertrees and Israel’s eTrees
In Singapore, the vision for the city of tomorrow extends beyond just physical objects found on urban streets. Singapore has been experimenting with innovative ways to update the look and feel of the city that fully integrates technology with the surrounding natural environment. In June 2012, for example, the city launched its “supertrees”  – a set of 18 man-made, 164-foot-high trees that are capable of absorbing and dispersing heat, collecting rainwater and generating solar power. The “supertrees” themselves contain vertical gardens and at night, they even light up with digital displays . For now, these trees are part of the vast  Gardens by the Bay  landscaping project, but it’s easy to see how similar types of supertrees might become stand-alone objects beautifying grim urban streets while simultaneously functioning as nodes of urban sensor networks.
The next step, of course, is to connect all those man-made trees to the Internet. As a preview of what might happen in the future, Israeli company Sologic announced in late October the launch of “solar-powered trees,” in which the “leaves” of the tree are actually solar panels that provide energy for WiFi connections, while the “trunk” of the tree contains outlets for electric-powered and USB devices. You can literally surf the Internet while connected to these eTrees . This concept, of course, is still in the experimental stage, but according to Sologic , both France and China are considering potential acquisitions of these solar-powered trees, each of which costs $100,000. The eTree was invented and developed by solar energy expert Michael Lasry and designed in collaboration with artist Yoav Ben Dov.
***
These three ideas hint at the vast potential of transforming outdated urban infrastructure into smart, connected networks. Giving urban streetscapes a facelift is just the start. New “smart city” innovations promise to improve urban lives in tangible ways via cost savings, new ways to empower citizens and new types of apps and services offered to city dwellers. Across the world, the race is on to become a model “smart city.” And now with the Internet of Things, those cities might become smarter than ever.

How the Redskins had such bad pass coverageComments
By Mark Bullock December 3
Entering the game against the Colts this past Sunday, the main Redskins story line was about quarterback Colt McCoy replacing Robert Griffin III. But by the end of the game, the Redskins’ defense stole the headlines. It was the worst I’ve seen the Redskins in coverage this season and perhaps further back than that.
Washington’s defense has been hamstrung by injuries to key personnel, which has played a part in them giving up one or two big plays a game. But against the Colts, it wasn’t just one or two big plays. Indianapolis had four touchdown passes of 30 yards or more and it should have been more, with tight end Coby Fleener dropping an easy touchdown pass in the second quarter.
Some plays were just mental errors by different defenders. But on other plays, there were players who looked like they weren’t sure of what their assignments were. Both David Amerson and Brandon Meriweather said there wasn’t a communication problem , although apparently they didn’t communicate that with Bashaud Breeland and Ryan Clark, who said there was one. But it was clear on multiple plays that the Redskins players weren’t on the same page. It was evident early on.
This play was on the Colts second drive. Indianapolis spreads out the Redskins’ defense, which plays man coverage with a single high safety, Ryan Clark, over the top. Naturally, Clark moves towards the three-receiver side of the field. But that leaves Chase Minnifield, who has spent most of the season on the practice squad, on an island against 6-foot-6 tight end Coby Fleener. That’s immediately a mismatch that is putting Redskins defenders in a position to fail, rather than succeed.
But Minnifield on Fleener wasn’t the only problem with the play. Washington blitzes from the three-receiver side of the field, leaving the inside receiver wide open. Clark charges down to try and pick up the free receiver, but that leaves the deep middle of the field completely uncovered. Meanwhile, both Ryan Kerrigan and Keenan Robinson drop to the flat to cover the running back out of the backfield.
In the end, Minnifield is forced to tackle Fleener and take the pass interference penalty, which was the best possible outcome for Washington. Had Minnifield not drawn the penalty, Fleener has a free catch and run into the end zone for a touchdown.
That’s a total failed coverage by the Redskins. They had two guys covering a running back in the flat, Minnifield was put in an extremely tough spot and they had an open receiver on the other side of the field.
It wasn’t just one play either.
Here, Colts quarterback Andrew Luck looks to his right to throw a quick out route to wide receiver T.Y. Hilton. But on the other side, Washington has another coverage mistake. On the last play, Kerrigan and Robinson both play the same assignment. This time, it’s Robinson and fellow inside linebacker Perry Riley Jr. that get their assignments crossed. Both play for the inside breaking receiver, leaving the outside receiver uncovered.
With everyone else seemingly playing man, it’s safe to assume that one of these two should have been covering the outside receiver spotting up, but they end up both taking Fleener inside. Luck hits Hilton on the out route, so this mistake isn’t crucial. But it was a sign that players weren’t communicating their assignments properly.
Even on a positive play for the Redskins, Ryan Clark’s interception, they had a similar mistake.
Safety Brandon Meriweather walks up to the line of scrimmage next to Robinson. Fleener runs a quick out route into the flat.
Both Robinson and Meriweather drop into coverage to cover Fleener. But one of them should be blitzing.
Meriweather realizes that either he or Robinson should be blitzing, so he leaves Fleener and starts to make a move towards the line of scrimmage. But by that time, Luck had started his throwing motion. The play results in a Clark interception, but that by no means clears Meriweather and Robinson of any wrong doing.
These three plays came early in the game and should have been warning signs of what was to come. The first Colts touchdown came as a result of another communication error.
The Colts split Fleener out wide and run a scissor concept, something the Redskins have struggled with all season.
Outside linebacker Trent Murphy drops into coverage. He initially attempts to jam Fleener to re-route him.
But then Murphy peels off Fleener and drops into a zone coverage.
The problem with that is that the Redskins weren’t in a zone coverage. They appeared to be in a two-man call, or two deep safeties with man coverage underneath. Amerson and Breeland stay with the outside receivers while Riley breaks on the running back running into the flat. But Murphy sits in a zone when he should have stayed with Fleener.
That leaves Fleener wide open for an easy touchdown catch.
Later on, Fleener should have had an even easier touchdown. The Redskins again had a miscommunication on defense and left Fleener wide open, but he dropped it.
Fleener lines up as an in-line tight end and runs a simple go route up the seam.
Some Redskins defenders play as if they are in man coverage, others play zone. Meriweather sticks close to the other tight end in the flat, while Breeland plays man technique on the outside receiver. But on the other side, Amerson plays as if he’s in cover-three, staying deep on the outside and keeping his eyes in the backfield.
Meanwhile, safety Ryan Clark drops to the top of the numbers, suggesting he thinks he’s responsible for the deep half of the field. Linebackers Riley, Robinson and Kerrigan all drop to underneath zones.
With so many players on different pages, it’s hard to tell exactly what the call was. But the result of it all was Fleener running free down the middle of the field.
Now I don’t think I’ve ever seen a receiver ever be as open as Fleener is here. Full credit should go to Andrew Luck on this play. He did an excellent job avoiding pressure from the Redskins pass rush while keeping his eyes down the field. He doesn’t panic under pressure, instead taking a few steps up into the pocket and then delivering a strike to Fleener, who drops the easiest touchdown he’d have ever had.
While the Redskins had problems with not being on the same page, they also had mental errors that resulted in two deep Donte Moncrief touchdowns.
This was Moncrief’s first touchdown. The Redskins appear to be in a cover-three defense, with the two outside corners and the deep safety responsible for deep thirds of the field.
But David Amerson blows the coverage. He should be staying on top of the deepest route, but instead has his eyes glued to the outside receiver and breaks on his hitch route, without the quarterback even looking his way. Meanwhile, Moncrief runs up the seam. Luck starts his read by looking to his left, forcing Clark to begin to run to that side of the field.
That creates even more room for Moncrief to run into. Luck works back to his right and finds Moncrief running wide open.
Moncrief makes the catch and Amerson can’t recover, leading to a 48-yard touchdown catch for the third-round rookie receiver.
Later on, Moncrief was allowed to run open deep again.
Moncrief runs another go route up the seam. Amerson once again lines up across from him, with Phillip Thomas playing safety over the top.
Amerson allows Moncrief a completely free release off the line of scrimmage.
From the look of the other defenders, the Redskins appear to be in a two-man call again, with two deep safeties and man coverage underneath.
But Amerson peels off to take an underneath route already covered by Breeland, while Thomas gets caught too far outside. Moncrief runs right up the seam past both Amerson and Thomas.
Luck makes another wide-open throw, this one resulting in a 79-yard touchdown.
This is as bad as it gets in coverage. Players weren’t on the same page from almost the first snap and never managed to get on the same page. We saw mental errors on some plays, miscommunication on others. Sometimes there were two players covering the same assignment and leaving other open, while on other plays defenders weren’t sure who was meant to blitz and who wasn’t.
It was a collective failure by the Redskins’ defense, one that reflects badly on both the players and coaches. They will have to show major improvements in the final four games, or the Redskins will require drastic changes with both personnel and coaching on defense.

Damaged Ferguson businesses receive pledges of almost $500 000By Wesley Lowery December 3 Follow @WesleyLowery

(AP Photo/St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Robert Cohen)
FERGUSON, Mo. – Much of the nation watched in horror as police cruisers were flipped, rocks were thrown and dozens of businesses in and near this St. Louis suburb were burned last week in a wave of anger.
And almost immediately, many across the nation were determined to help Ferguson rebuild.
Beginning the morning after the St. Louis County grand jury decision not to indict Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson in the death of unarmed teen Michael Brown, a number of online fundraising efforts – some started by benevolent strangers – began popping up.
A week later, hundreds of thousands of dollars have poured into the accounts on behalf of the damaged and burned Ferguson businesses.
In total, almost $500,000 from 12,700 donors has been raised using the GoFundMe Web site for damaged businesses in Ferguson.
“The many recent campaigns started for Ferguson business owners are shining examples of what can happen when communities come together for a common cause,” said Kelsea Little, a spokeswoman for GoFundMe. “It’s incredibly heartwarming to see so many generous people come together to help these businesses rebuild.”
Internet fundraising has played a central role in the national reaction to the ongoing saga in Ferguson.
Within a day of the public release of Wilson’s name, hundreds of thousands of dollars were donated at fundraisers and online for his legal defense. The Brown family, meanwhile, collected a few thousand dollars in an online fundraiser set up to offset their son’s burial costs and funeral.
So it seemed to make sense that the businesses damaged in the unrest following the grand jury announcement did the same thing.

Soon after his church was burned down, Pastor Carlton Lee knew the first step to rebuilding – well, the second step, after calling his insurers – was to set up an online fundraising page.
“We’re praying and hoping to find the funds to rebuild,” Lee said last week, when the fundraiser had brought in just $2,000. By the end of the week, more than $60,000 had been donated to help him
And the media has taken note. CNN and MSNBC have both run several segments profiling several of the businesses, while stories of the resilient store owners have appeared in the New York Times, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Huffington Post and elsewhere, including the Washington Post.
The news coverage does seem to have helped, with many of the store owners pointing to spikes in donations following articles and cable news segments.
A St. Louis Post-Dispatch image of a sobbing Natalie Dubose in the minutes after her cake shop was vandalized rocketed across the internet.
Among those who saw it was Kristine Froeba, a writer and activist in New Orleans, who immediately called Dubose and asked permission to set up an online fundraising account in her name.
“I found that incredible photo and said: I’m going to help her,” Froeba said.
Meanwhile, another good Samaritan in Miami had begun a second fundraiser for Dubose. Within days, benefactors had poured more than $250,000 into an account for her.
“Everyone just wanted to do something to make this better,” said Froeba, who is helping Dubose send thank-you notes to all 8,000 donors (they’ve gotten 400 down so far). “We’ve just been saying thank you so much to so many people.”
With her coffers overflowing, Dubose is now directing donors to the other 21 online fundraisers for Ferguson businesses.
Among those who Dubose has helped is Juanita Morris, who watched her Fashions R Boutique burn down on live television.
On Monday, the $20,000 goal set for her online fundraising account – set up by a freshman from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill — was surpassed.
“I would like to thank each and every one of you from the bottom of my heart,” Morris wrote in a message to those who had donated to the GoFundMe account in her name. “It’s nice to know that there are people out there like you. All of your support and well wishes has truly made a difference in my life.”

The Queen’s Royal Touch hair salon has been given about $7,700, still well short of the $19,000 its owners are hoping to bring in. Ferguson Market and Liquor – where Brown was captured on video allegedly shoplifting and roughing up a store clerk just minutes before his encounter with Wilson – netted a little more than $30,000, mostly in small donations, in the weeks since the violence.
Over on South Florissant Avenue, where violent clashes with police and fires left several businesses damaged, Cathy and Jerome Jenkins are about halfway to the $20,000 they hope to bring for repairs to their two businesses – Cathy’s Kitchen and J & C BBQ and Blues Restaurant.
The couple has been resilient, reopening Cathy’s Kitchen the day following the chaos. On the board that now covers one of the restaurant’s front windows, a local girl painted a mural that reads: “Love will win.”

DC Jazz Festival names new artistic directorComments
By Lauren McEwen December 3
The DC Jazz Festival has named Willard Jenkins as its new artistic director, effective Jan. 5, 2015. The writer, producer, educator, and arts administrator has focused heavily on jazz throughout the course of his long and varied career.
The Ohio native has taught courses on jazz at both Cleveland State University and his alma mater Kent State University. He also previously served as the artistic director for other major jazz festivals, including Cleveland’s Tri-C JazzFest and Boston’s Beantown Jazz Festival, while serving as an artistic consultant for both the Smithsonian and Maryland’s Mid-Atlantic Jazz Festival.
Jenkins is the first artistic director that the DCJF has hired. The festival’s founder, Charles Fishman, who helped bring the DC Jazz Festival to life 10 years ago, previously held the role.
“First and foremost, I greatly admire Charlie Fishman, particularly for his fortitude and perseverance in developing the DC Jazz Festival,” Jenkins said in a statement. “It was very much needed in this community, but Charlie is the one who took the initiative and made it happen. I join the ranks of those who will always be grateful to Charlie for having taken that step.”
Though the DCJF hosts programs throughout the year,  the DC Jazz Festival  itself will be held next summer from June 10 to June 16, 2015 and will feature 150 local musicians as well as artists from 12 different countries including Brazil, Italy, Iceland and Cuba.

NTPC plans expansion of power plants in Telangana
PTI
This is part of the 4000 mw power plant to be set up in Telangana. 1600 mw power plant will be set up at the existing location in Ramagundam. The company seeks land for rest of the capacity.
Hyderabad, Dec 3:  
NTPC has approached the Ministry of Environment and Forest seeking amendments to Terms of Reference (TOR) for its proposed expansion of Telangana’s Ramagundam power plant to 2x800 mw.
According to a senior official of the company, earlier the power producer was accorded permission for expanding the capacity to 2x660 mw.
NTPC is presently operating a coal based 2600 MW (Stage—I, II & III) Thermal Power Station at Ramagundam in Karimnagar District of Telangana.
“This is part of the 4000 mw power plant proposed to be set up in Telangana state. 1600 mw power plant will be set up at the existing location in Ramagundam. We are seeking land from the Telangana Government for rest of the capacity,” the official said.
He said the cost of project would be between Rs 5.5 crore to Rs 6 crore per MW and the Board has already approved the proposal.
It is proposed to allocate 100 per cent power to Telangana state subject to approval by Ministry of Power.
Considering the location and optimisation of available space at both locations to accommodate 4000 MW, 800 MW units have been proposed, the official added.
Coal requirement for the project is estimated as 7.37 MTPA (20197 tonnes per day) to achieve 90 per cent PLF, a senior Government official said.
Presently, coal is sourced from Singareni Collieries Company Limited or SCCL, a government-owned coal mining company.
Further, the Government of Telangana has recently requested Ministry of Coal to allot 8 MTPA coal for the proposed expansion (Phase—I) which is expected to begin April 2018.

Britain to pay back all WWI debtsBritain to pay back all WWI debts
PTI
Tweet
London, Dec 3:  
Britain is to pay back all of its World War I debts, worth some £1.9 billion through a refinancing deal involving the issue of new bonds, Finance Minister, George Osborne said today.
It will also repay bonds dating as far back as the 18th century when a massive speculative crash known as the South Sea Bubble occurred in 1720, leaving behind significant national debts.
The government will capitalise on current very low interest rates to refinance the debts.
“This is a moment for Britain to be proud of,” Osborne said.
“We can, at last, pay off the debts Britain incurred to fight the First World War. It is a sign of our fiscal credibility and it’s a good deal for this generation of taxpayers. It’s also another fitting way to remember that extraordinary sacrifice of the past.”
Officials estimate that Britain has paid some £5.5 billion in interest on its World War I debts since 1917.
More than 1,20,000 people have War Loan gilts, making it the most widely held British government bond. They are all to be contacted soon to receive payment of the paper.
Osborne announced in October that the government would pay back £218 million of bonds but today’s announcement goes significantly further.

SEC charges India-origin person for share sale fraudSEC charges India-origin person for share sale fraud

Tweet
Washington, Dec 3:  
US market regulator SEC has charged India-origin Vinay Kumar Nevatia for fraudulent sale of shares to the tune of $900,000 by claiming that he owned these stocks.
Kumar sold the stocks he supposedly owned in a privately-held information technology company called CSS Corp Technologies (Mauritius) Ltd. He is the owner of several now-defunct investment entities.
According to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Kumar deceived the buyers into believing that he owned the shares, orchestrated a series of secret wire transfers, and induced the stock transfer agent into recording his fraudulent sales.
“He stole the money he received from investors for his own use,” SEC said in a statement on Tuesday.
Besides, Kumar has never been registered with the SEC nor was licensed to trade securities.
As per the SEC complaint filed in federal district court in San Francisco, Kumar provided the true owners of the shares with fake updates on their investments for more than a year after he had disposed of their stock in these subsequent sales in 2011 and 2012.
The actual owners had bought the CSS stock through Kumar back in 2008.
“Kumar portrayed himself as a legitimate investment professional when he was actually double dealing stock shares and pocketing money for himself,” said Jina L Choi, Director of SEC’s San Francisco Regional Office.

Kaspersky: Fraudsters may attack banks directly in 2015Coimbatore, Dec 3:  
Kaspersky Lab's experts anticipate targeted cyber-attacks on banks and Apple devices in 2015.
With the confidence of fraudsters on an upswing, the emergence of a new trend targeted directly against banks cannot be ruled out, say the Labs experts.
“And the fraudsters won't stop there; they will try to develop new malware that can take cash directly from the ATM,” the experts warned, sharing insights about possible targeted attacks in the coming year.
In its Security Bulletin 2014, the Lab's experts have indicated the possible targeted attacks in 2015. Among others, it includes attacks against virtual payment systems, against ATMs, more Internet-bleeding stories and vulnerabilities exposing the Internet infrastructure to menacing attacks, attacks in the wild against network printers and other connected devices and more diverse attacks.
While cautioning users, the endpoint solutions provider noted that attacks against cash machines (ATMs) seemed to explode this year with several public incidents and a rush by law enforcement authorities globally to respond to this crisis.
“In 2015, we expect to see further evolution of these ATM attacks with the use of targeted malicious techniques gaining access to the “brain” of cash machines. The next stage will see compromising the networks of banks and using that level of access to manipulate ATM machines real time,” notes Alexander Gostev, Chief Security Expert at the Global Research and Analysis Team, Kaspersky Lab.

Govt differs with Amit Shah over Saradha scam claimMAMATA BANERJEE, West Bengal Chief Minister
BJP President Amit Shah
Saradha has no link with terrorist activities so far: Govt
New Delhi, Dec 3 :  
In what could be an embarrassment for BJP President Amit Shah, who publicly alleged that the Saradha chit fund scam funds were linked to the recent Burdwan blasts in West Bengal, the Government on Wednesday said its probe had so far not found any such link with terrorist activities.
In a written reply to the Lok Sabha, Minister of State for Personnel, Jitendra Singh, said, “The investigation has so far not revealed any such transaction where money was routed to Bangladesh to fund terrorist activities.”
Singh was asked whether the Government has sought details of the probe into the Saradha chit fund scam after reports indicated that a part of the money was routed to Bangladesh to fund terror activities. Singh replied that Government has not sought details of the probe.
To another question on whether the Saradha chief admitted to paying large sums to several people to influence the case in his favour, Singh said, “The matter is under investigation.”
Singh’s reply is sure to provide more fodder to the Trinamool Congress (TMC), which has stepped up its protest against the Government in both Houses of Parliament on a range of issues following the BJP’s frontal attack on it on the Saradha scam. The BJP, which increased its vote share in West Bengal in the recent Lok Sabha polls, is eyeing a bigger pie in the Assembly polls in 2016.
In a rally in Kolkata last Sunday, Shah had alleged that Saradha money was used in the October 2 Burdwan blast being probed for links with Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh, a terror outfit. “Saradha chit fund money was used in the Burdwan blast. The NIA (National Investigation Agency) is not being allowed to probe the blast properly,” he had said, alleging that hurdles were being created to save some TMC leaders. Incidentally, some key TMC leaders and MPs are behind bars or are being interrogated in the multi-crore scam.
Last week, during a debate on black money in the Lok Sabha, BJP leader Anurag Thakur, too, said "TMC people come with black umbrellas here and fill their own pockets with black money. Not just that, they finance terrorists also with that money", he said.
Meanwhile, TMC demanded an apology from Shah. "Amit Shah Should apologise for making wild allegations" party leader Sudip Bandopadhyay told

Indian software market grows 10.7% in H1 2014: IDCAbbott Healthcare settles Nervup trademark tussle in its favour, pays up Jayaar Remedies
Political stability and improving economic sentiments have helped the software market in India grow by 10.7 per cent in January-June 2014 period as compared to first half of previous year, research firm IDC said today.
The formation of a stable NDA government resulted in some amount of positivity in the market which reflected in IT investments by major verticals like banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), retail, manufacturing and e-commerce, IDC said in a statement.
The period also saw few of the big vendors closing major deals which were in the pipeline since early 2013 but did not materialise owing to economic and political uncertainties, it added.
Though IDC did not disclose the size of the market in the first half of 2014, it had pegged the Indian IT software market at Rs 10,913 crore in January-June 2013 period.
IDC expects the software market to grow at a stable pace in the next five years (2014-2018) with a healthy CAGR of 10.5 per cent.
Some of the areas which are expected to witness software uptake are mobile application development & mobile device management, security software, system software, analytics and engineering applications, IDC said.
In the January-June 2014 period, Microsoft led with 31.8 per cent share of the software vendor market, followed by Oracle at 12 per cent, SAP (6.5 per cent), IBM (5.5 per cent) and Synopsys (4.2 per cent).
BFSI, manufacturing and communication & media were the top verticals which invested in upgrades and new licenses.
Some of the sectors to watch out for in future include entertainment, retail, e-commerce, education and hospitality, IDC said.
“There has been a shift in the mindset of users across these industries. IT investments are now made not only for process improvements but also for growing business opportunities and improving customer experience,” it added.
Some of the solutions which were readily accepted across verticals included customer analytics, mobile solutions, cloud solutions, customer management solutions, omni-channel management systems, data loss prevention etc.
Government initiatives like Mobile Seva, Digital India, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana and the likes will be instrumental in triggering adoption of software solutions in the coming years, IDC said.
Launch of various schemes and policies is expected to catalyse software uptake by manufacturing, retail, travel & tourism and BFSI in the coming 2-3 years, it added.

Gold cracks Rs 26 000-mark amid selling; silverrecoversSugar prices under pressure over Brazilian dumping
Gold prices weakened further and closed below the Rs 26,000 per 10 grams mark at the domestic bullion market on Monday, due to reduced offtake from jewellery stockists as well as lack of local buying support.
Expectations of a further fall in prices in the coming days after scrapping of gold import curbs alongside sharp volatility in overseas market mainly kept buyers on the sidelines.
On the other hand, silver rebounded sharply on the back of renewed industrial demand.
Standard gold (99.5 purity) moved down by Rs 35 to close at Rs 25,965 per 10 grams from last Saturday’s closing level of Rs 26,000.
Pure gold (99.9 purity) also eased by a similar margin to end at Rs 26,115 per 10 grams compared to Rs 26,150.
However, silver (.999 fineness) rose by Rs 125 to conclude at Rs 36,115 per kg from the weekend level of Rs 35,990.
On the global front, the yellow metal plummeted sharply to its lowest since 2009, after Swiss voters rejected a referendum requiring their central bank to hold a portion of its assets in gold.
However, the shiny metal managed to recover from the day’s low on weak Chinese data.
Spot gold was bid higher at USD 1,175 an ounce in early European trade.

Rajya Sabha adjourned repeatedly after uproar over Minister s remarksPeshawar school attack: Pakistani pupils recall narrow escapes, carnage in Taliban slaughter
A united Opposition created uproar in the Rajya Sabha while demanding resignation of Union Minister Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti for her controversial remarks, forcing repeated adjournments.
It was trouble right from the word go with opposition also attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not coming to the House to speak on the issue and wanted him to announce the “sacking” of the minister in the House.
Parliamentary Affairs Minister M Venkaiah Naidu rejected their demand citing controversial remarks made in the past by leaders from other parties as well.
BJP members engaged in angry exchange of words with those in the Opposition as the government appeared toughening its stand on the issue with a number of ministers countering the demand.
Members from Congress, SP and JD (U) trooped into the Well while those from CPI-M, CPI and Trinamool Congress were on their feet rejecting the government’s argument that the matter should be treated as closed since the minister has already expressed regret.
The House was adjourned four times in the pre-lunch session because of the pandemonium.
Soon after Rajya Sabha Chairman Hamid Ansari took up obituary references after the House met for the day, Opposition members were on their feet demanding action against the minister.
Renewing his demand for passing a condemnation resolution by the House, Naresh Agrawal (SP) said, “This House does not have faith in the minister and demands that she be sacked.”
Deputy Leader of Congress Anand Sharma said the remarks made by the minister is “not only a cognisable but also compoundable offence” under section 153(A) of the IPC and demanded that the Prime Minister should come to the House and inform it that the minister has been sacked.
Section 153(A) of the IPC deals with the offence of promoting enmity between different groups on ground of religion, race, place of birth, residence and language and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony.
“We are not seeking any apology. The minister should be sacked. This is an insult to the Constitution. The Prime Minister should inform the House that the minister has been sacked,” Sharma said.
Sitaram Yechury (CPI-M) noted that what the minister said yesterday was “not an apology”. “A mere apology will not absolve her of the crime,” he said.”…How can someone who violated the Constitution remain a minister…That minister has no right to remain a minister. Either the minister should resign or the Prime Minister should remove her,” he said.
In the din, Home Minister Rajnath Singh laid a statement on the killing of 14 CRPF jawans in Chhattisgarh after visiting Raipur yesterday.
Countering the Opposition, Naidu said, “One of the minsters, a new minister made some remarks outside the House, which are not acceptable, objectionable. The minister came to the House and regretted it and offered an apology…if the statement is not clear (to members), I will ask her to make the statement again,” he said.
As the Opposition members remained adamant on her dismissal, Naidu said controversial remarks were made in past too by leaders of other parties.
“One of the members, a former minister had made a serious remark against former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. He did not apologise but then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had tendered an apology on his behalf,” Naidu said, and recalled someone had also called SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav a “terrorist”.
The Parliamentary Affairs Minister also referred to the controversial remarks “threatening rape” by Trinamool Congress MP Tapas Pal and recalled that after he apologised West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had said what else she could do wondering whether she should kill him.
“This is not the way”, Naidu said resenting the continued protests on the issue by Opposition members. He also urged Deputy Chairman P J Kurien to allow the Home Minister to make a statement on Chhattisgarh Maoist attack.
Opposition members also took umbrage to Kurien allowing the Home Minister to make the statement when he had called Anand Sharma and Yechury to speak on the issue.
Yechury resented that Opposition members were not given a chance to seek clarifications on the minister’s statement “against the norms of the House”.
Sharad Yadav (JD-U) said if the Prime Minister, who has appointed Jyoti a minister takes action against her, it will send a signal and others will not make such remarks in future.
As Sharma kept insisting that what the minister said constituted of a criminal offence that could fetch an imprisonment of up to three years, members from the treasury benches told him to “go to the court”.
When Kurien called a member from the ruling BJP to speak on the issue, Opposition members resented it and trooped into the Well.
There were two adjournments in the Zero Hour.
Similar scenes were witnessed during the Question Hour also.
As Chairman Hamid Ansari took up the first question of the day, Congress members came into the Well shouting slogans. SP and JD-U members also joined them.
Ansari’s request to allow the Question Hour to proceed went in vain and amid din, he adjourned the House for 15 minutes.
When the House reassembled, Opposition members resumed their protest and the House was adjourned till 2 PM.

Having missed a Season, the singer returns with renewed energy and a fresh repertoire.
“The December Season never allows you to rest on your laurels. Every approaching December means time to push boundaries and scale greater heights, musically,” says Aruna Sairam by way of her opening remarks during a chat.
Having been sorely missed by rasikas last Season (her reason for being away were personal), Aruna is back in the scene, preparing for a not-too-grinding schedule. “I have about seven concerts lined up, beginning December 7 (Margazhi Mahotsav). I believe that with lesser number of concerts, you achieve two-fold goals – you can concentrate and do a better job and also, your rasika base will be strong,” says the veteran, who is a practitioner of the evocative yet powerful T. Brinda bani.
Even as she talks about this special time in the city, memories flood her mind. “I recall coming here when I was just eight or nine. My parents would rent a small flat for a week or more. Those days, stalwarts such as Papanasam Sivan and Rukmini Ramani would do ‘vidhi bhajanai’ at seven in the morning on the streets of Mylapore. The air would be filled with piety; it was so infectious.” And then the family would head towards the Music Academy for the 9 a.m. lec-dems and thematic talks. “One of the most profound lectures I heard was the one by Balasaraswathi. For 45 minutes, she showcased various abhinaya options for just three words – ‘Vaari Mudindha Kuzhal. That lec-dem is legend.”
Another special moment came when Aruna’s guru Brindamma was feted with the Sangita Kalanidhi. “I was with her all the time. It was so special. Those days, I heard a lot more music than I sang. It was a beautiful time when I learnt, imbibed and enjoyed.”
For the teenaged Aruna, her biggest thrill came when the great Maharajapuram Santhanam spotted her in the corridor one evening. Aruna remembers, “He paused and spoke to me. ‘You are Aurna, right? How is your practice going? Sing with your heart.’ I still remember how tongue-tied I was, and yes, I could not sleep for a few days, so excited was I!”
That Aruna made her Season debut in 1973 is well known. But what many do not know is that she had initially applied for the competition. “My guru casually mentioned that it might help if I got a chance to perform. And the next thing we know, I was informed that my name was there in the Junior slot. So I withdrew my application from the competition and sang at the Academy.” And the rest, as they say, is history!
But what is interesting to note is that Aruna never thought she would become a professional musician. “What changed my mind was listening to the legendary Trio – D.K. Pattammal, M.S. Subbulakshmi and M.L. Vasanthakumari. Their stage presence, charisma and their music proved to be a great inspiration. In way, they led me to what I have become today.”
Like always, rasikas can expect an eclectic fare from Aruna -- some interesting RTPs, unusual kritis in ghana ragas interspersed with popular and time-tested ragas, and of course, her light classical pieces.
Welcome back, Aruna Sairam!

Is that hyper-realism, photo-realism or is the camera merely a tool? Artists present their take on the synergy between photography and painting
Art and photography have, for long, been considered strange bedfellows by puritans. There are endless debates as to whether photography can be termed as art. The art fraternity has found itself divided in the middle while discussing if and how photography can find its way to canvases.
Masuram Ravikanth takes pride in stating that his father owned a photo studio in Warangal and those black and white negatives play a huge part in his artistic expression. Ravikanth’s new exhibition, Spandolika, which opened at Kalakriti, Trident, showcases wooden, rocking horses that were once part of childhood games. Earlier, Ravikanth brought to the canvas slivers of the past — Royal DictArt depicted portraits of royals; Romancing the Reminisces harked back to the 70s. “I came across 120mm b&w negatives, 500 of them, from my father’s studio. These large negatives are rare to find. In them, I found interesting subjects that became the base for my paintings. I develop concepts and use these photographs as reference,” he explains. He doesn’t term his technique photo-realism since he doesn’t create replicas of these photographs.
In fact, photo-realism and hyper-realism are areas in which very few Indian artists specialise. G. Anjaneyulu specialises in hyper-realism where he draws viewers’ attention to everyday objects. His paintings are on white canvas and the subjects, ranging from a lantern to a brass vessel, appear three dimensional and life-like. “Some feel I merely shoot photographs and replicate them as paintings. In reality, this is not easy to do. Hyper-realism calls for a lot of patience. I shoot an object in several angles, choose an angle that will best represent the object, and use this as reference while painting,” he says.
Anjaneyulu isolates these objects from their background since he wants the focus to be only on these objects. Curator and Daira gallery owner Atiya Amjad remembers one of his hyper-realistic work that showed a shirt on a hanger. “It felt like I was looking at a real shirt waiting to be worn,” she says.
Anjaneyulu’s subjects vary from soda bottles to screw driver. “These paintings are larger than the photographs, which means I need to pay attention to details while getting the light and shade effect to make it appear like a photograph,” he says.
Established artists like Laxman Aelay and Fawad Tamkanath also have a keen eye for photography and use them as references. Fawad says he considers the camera a tool, just like a pen.
“I shoot a number of photographs but don’t print all of them. These shots later act as a sketchbook reference. I keep in mind the imagery, develop my concept, superimpose, add or delete as necessary,” he says.
Fawad doesn’t subscribe to the thought of replicating on canvas what one sees in a photograph. “Some artists merely reproduce a photography print on acrylic canvas and call it mixed media work. That’s taking an easy way out. The ‘art’ work wouldn’t last long,” he says. He admits that photo-realism and hyper-realism are small segments in Indian art.
Fawad’s daughter Afza, on the other hand, likes to maintain photo diary of things she observes. “These days, it’s tough to find models who’d pose for hours for paintings. When I have an idea, I get my cousins and friends to pose for me and shoot many photographs. I shoot each day and don’t know how and when these pictures will lend themselves to paintings,” she says.
Many of Afza’s paintings on people are headless and she believes the paintings should converse with viewers through the body language of the subjects. Hence, we may not see the faces of the group of girls engrossed in conversation, but the painting speaks volumes through their body language, casually placed handbags, a cola bottle, coffee, purses and footwear. There are times when she has used photographs as a base for multi-media projections. “I don’t know if there is a name to the technique I follow,” she says when asked. “I paint instinctively and maybe I could call it almost hyper-realistic. I use water colours,” she adds.
French artist Beatrice de Fays who has exhibited in the city on several occasions has a different method with photographs. “I use them as an ethnographic element to study places, people and behaviour,” says Beatrice. Her multimedia installations are interactive and she uses photographic images to arrive at 3D drawings of iconic buildings or to present an artistic perception of the world. “I like to mix mediums and not stick to the pre-established benchmarks,” she says.
Artists speak:
Photographs act as a sketchbook reference. I keep in mind the imagery and develop my concept.

Finance Ministry looking forward to RBI to support revivalNew Delhi, December 2, 2014

Finance Ministry ‘looking forward to RBI to support revival’
Puja Mehra
interest rate
The Union Finance Ministry has said that the Centre and the Reserve Bank will work towards a monetary policy framework that will help reduce inflationary expectations and further support the revival of investment and growth.
Responding to the Monetary Policy Statement issued by the Reserve Bank on Tuesday morning, the Ministry stated in the evening: “Government looks forward to the RBI [Reserve Bank of India] supporting the revival of growth and employment.”
In the weeks ahead, the government and the RBI will work towards a monetary policy framework that will help institutionalise the gains achieved on the inflation front, so as to reduce inflationary expectations and further support the revival of investment and growth, the Ministry said.
As expected, the RBI kept the key policy rates unchanged in its Monetary Policy but warned that the favourable base effect that is driving down inflation will likely dissipate and the data for the month of December “may well rise above current levels”. It also said that the sharp deceleration in retail inflation was to some extent on account of transitory factors such as favourable base effects and the usual softening of fruits and vegetable prices that occurs at this time of the year. It red-flagged the continuing upside pressures in prices of protein-rich food items such as milk and pulses, which, it said, reflect structural mismatches in supply and demand.
The RBI also said that the key uncertainty was the durability of the upturn as the full outcome of the north-east monsoon will determine the intensity of price pressures relating to cereals, oilseeds and pulses. “...but it is reasonable to expect some firming up of these prices in view of the monsoon’s performance so far and the shortfall estimated for kharif production.”
The Reserve Bank retained its growth projection for 2014-15 at 5.5 per cent stating that a durable revival of investment demand continues to be held back by infrastructural constraints and lack of assured supply of key inputs, in particular coal, power, land and minerals. It would be the success of ongoing Government actions these areas that will be key to reviving growth.

Nifty to touch 9 960 level by Dec 2015  says MacquarieDirect equity set to top FDs as biggest asset class in FY15: Report
The National Stock Exchange index Nifty is expected to touch 9,960 level by December 2015, supported by liquidity, policy reforms and improving fundamentals, says a report.
According to global brokerage firm Macquarie, development backed agenda is expected to drive the country’s economy as well as the equity market and the Nifty is expected to reach as high as 21,500 in next five years.
The Nifty has given around 36 per cent returns in 2014 so far this year as against 4 per cent return for MSCI World Index and is expected to give another 16 per cent return over the next 12 months, which should take the Index to 9,960 points, the report said.
The 50-share index today settled at 8,537.65, higher by 12.95 points or 0.15 per cent.
“We believe the market can re-rate further to 16-17x if economic recovery is stronger than expected. Our 12-month Nifty target is 9940 based on 15x FY17E EPS,” Macquarie said in a research note today.
From being amongst the least preferred markets more than a year ago, India has climbed up the charts to being amongst the most preferred markets to invest in.
According to the report, the factors that are building up investor sentiments include, the Narendra Modi-led new government which brought about stability in an otherwise volatile political environment and improved market sentiment. In addition, there were affirmative action by the government on several fronts.
Moreover, with crude prices falling sharply, macro indicators have turned favourable and improved conditions for economic recovery to take shape.
“All of these are excellent conditions for an equity bull market to sustain for several years,” Macquarie said and added that Nifty could reach 17,400-21,500 over the next five years.
Along with good FII inflows of around USD 16 billion so far this year, domestic mutual funds have turned net buyers with their net inflows aggregating to around USD 4.2 billion since May.
“Valuations may not be cheap but can sustain at high levels given that India is relatively better placed than other emerging markets,” Macquarie said.

India s first virtual store for the differently abledAbbott Healthcare settles Nervup trademark tussle in its favour, pays up Jayaar Remedies
To mark the International day for people with disability (on December 3), the country’s first online Rehab and Support store for the differently abled was launched in the Capital. The first-of-its-kind virtual store, from the stable of Snapdeal.com, was inaugurated by Member of Parliament Shashi Tharoor.
It aims at providing accessibility to differently abled people for a convenient shopping experience, with more than 1,100 products ranging from wheelchairs to hearing machines and walking sticks.
The store will also enable the buyers to compare product specifications and make an informed buying decision.
Tharoor said, “We have all long taken for granted that as long as we can afford to buy something, we can go wherever we want, buy whatever we want.
But the differently abled usually do not have that opportunity. For them, it is a struggle to get to a shop, and reach the kind of product they need.
With this initiative, the differently abled can now buy products at the click of a mouse.”
Rohit Bansal, Co-founder, Snapdeal.com, added, “Approximately 27 million people in India have a disability and there are barely any services specifically targeted at providing them with access to benefits of India’s technological progress. Through this initiative, we are aiming to provide them access to various support and rehabilitation products.
Now, people with different abilities will be able to access these niche products easily sitting in the comforts of their homes for a convenient shopping experience.” The store can be accessed at http://www.snapdeal.com/offers/rehabilitation .

Supreme Court sets up Social Justice Bench to deal with social issuesWritten by Utkarsh Anand | New Delhi |
Posted: December 4, 2014 12:03 am | Updated: December 4, 2014 1:09 pm
Resolute that people’s voices never go unheard before the highest court of the land, Chief Justice of India H L Dattu has set up a special bench, christened “Social Justice Bench”, to specifically deal with the issues troubling a common man in everyday life. This is the first time the Supreme Court will have a dedicated bench to hear cases pertaining to public interest and all fresh PILs may be heard by the new bench from now. Currently, such cases are scattered over different benches.
This is the first time the Supreme Court will have a dedicated bench to hear cases pertaining to public interest and all fresh PILs may be heard by the new bench from now. Currently, such cases are scattered over different benches.
Notifying the constitution of a two-judge bench on Wednesday, the CJI, through an official note, expressed concern over pendency of several cases in the Supreme Court without a proper hearing.
Cases that relate to problems in society and those which have a direct impact on the rights of the people are the areas where the constitutional mechanism has to play a proactive role so as to meet the goals of the Constitution, according to the note.
“Honb’le the Chief Justice of India is of the view that these cases shall be given a specialised approach for their early disposal so that the masses will realise the fruits of the rights provided to them by the constitutional text,” stated the note, adding the CJI’s order aimed at securing social justice — one of the ideals of the Constitution.
Secretary General VSR Avadhani told The Indian Express that the CJI has directed that the Social Justice Bench would start functioning from December 12. The new bench will devise a procedure to expeditiously deal with the issues and would continue to sit on every working Friday at 2 pm to monitor the implementation of its directions to authorities concerned.
Justice Madan B Lokur and Justice Uday U Lalit would comprise the bench, which will hear not only the pending cases but also all the fresh matters on the pertinent issues. Out of around 200 such cases pending in the court, 65 cases have been identified to begin with and the cases, already pending before other benches, may get transferred to the special bench on the directions of the CJI.
Release of surplus food grains for people affected by natural calamities after framing a comprehensive scheme for public distribution, rehabilitation of sex workers, prevention of untimely death of pregnant women and children due to malnourishment or lack of medical care, hygienic mid-day meal, shelter homes for the destitute and homeless and education for the children are illustrations of the kind of cases that the new bench would take up.

Hyundai Elite i20 receives 56 000 bookingsBy: Express News Service | New Delhi |
Posted: December 3, 2014 7:26 pm
Since the day Hyundai launched the Elite i20 in India, it was anything but a foregone conclusion that they had a winner in their hands. Handsome looks, class-leading interiors, frugal engine options and an inexhaustive list of equipment make the Elite i20 an irresistible value for money proposition in its segment. According to Hyundai, the response for the car has been overwhelming thus far. A case which is entirely reflected in Hyundai’s sales report as well.
The Hyundai Elite i20 has been a runaway success for its maker. Hyundai claims that till date (just about 4 months after the launch) it has received a record 56,000 bookings for the Elite i20 from customers in India. Which happens to be the highest ever for any Hyundai branded vehicle within that much time-frame in India.
During the first month after it went on sale, the Elite i20 briskly climbed up the sales ladder, straightway making it into the list of top 10 best selling cars in India. In November 2014, the company has further sold a whopping 10,500 units of the car. In addition to that, Hyundai also states that it has received over 300,000 customer enquiries for the car post its launch in India.
Commenting on the success of the Elite i20 in India, Rakesh Srivastava, Sr. VP, Sales & Marketing, Hyundai India said, “We are overwhelmed by 56,000 customer bookings on strong appreciation and acceptance of the new Elite i20 making it a huge success. The demand of Elite i20 has doubled and in November we sold 10,500 units. We are working towards increasing its production for faster deliveries to offer a delightful experience to customers. The Elite i20 has seen heightened response across the country for petrol and diesel variants creating new Elite customers for future. Hyundai reaffirms its commitment to the customer and will continue to bring world-class products.”
Hyundai offers the Elite i20 in a choice of either a 1.4-litre CRDi diesel engine or a 1.2-litre Kappa petrol engine. The petrol engine returns an ARAI certified mileage of 18.60 km/l, while the diesel unit has an impressive ARAI certified fuel economy of 22.54 km/l.
Prices for the Hyundai Elite i20 start at Rs 4.90 lakh and go all the up to Rs 7.67 lakh (prices indicative of ex-showroom, New Delhi)

Mufti Sayeed exhorts voters to participate in Assembly pollsBy: Press Trust of India | Srinagar |
Posted: December 3, 2014 7:08 pm | Updated: December 3, 2014 7:45 pm
Exhorting electors to participate in voting in the ensuing assembly elections in Srinagar, Opposition PDP patron Mufti Mohammad Sayeed on Wednesday said larger participation of the city’s “emancipated” residents would add “credibility and prestige” to the democratic process.
“Srinagar being the intellectual and political nerve centre of the state cannot remain aloof from the urge for
change that is sweeping Jammu and Kashmir and the active participation of Srinagar in the political process for change will add credibility and prestige to it,” Sayeed said.
He was addressing a public meeting in Hazratbal assembly segment in Srinagar to garner support for party candidate Asiya Naqash.
The Peoples Democratic Party patron said the aloofness of Srinagar from the democratic process has resulted in political disempowerment of its people which has led its beneficiaries to take them for granted.
“Elect your representatives through vote and then make them accountable and see how things will start improving. The people of Srinagar owe it to themselves and fellow countrymen, not to let their power determine the state’s destiny be used by default by any party for indulging in exploitative politics,” he said.
He urged the youths of the summer capital of the state to get actively involved in political decision-making to ensure empowerment of the enterprising young population of the city.
“I am sure the realisation has dawned on the citizens of Srinagar that by remaining aloof from the political and
democratic processes, they are causing more harm to themselves than anybody else. Let that not happen this time,” he said.
“Unfortunately Srinagar city has always remained victim of the NC’s systematic neglect and misrule and the party has been only exploiting the historical city for its political gains. The urban chaos and underdevelopment which the city is facing is all because of the rulers who have been calling it their safety structure and safe house,” he said.

As a holiday gift, it's not too early to get millennials thinking about their financial future.
A personal finance book or other like-minded gift may not be at the top of most 20- and 30-somethings' wish lists this holiday season. But if you're new to managing money, it might be a good idea.
What should you ask for? Financial advisers and other money pros offered these suggestions.
Personal finance books
You have plenty of options when it comes to books about managing money.
William Bernstein, a Portland, Ore.-based investment adviser and author of several books on investing, has written an electronic booklet specifically for 20-somethings, "If You Can: How Millennials Can Get Rich Slowly." You can find the text for free at ETF.com (go to etf.com/docs/IfYouCan.pdf ) or for sale at Amazon.com for $0.99 ($5.99 for a paperback version).
0
In the booklet—which by itself would make a good inexpensive gift—Bernstein suggests a reading list of half a dozen books to help you get a handle on investing. But the texts are part of "a choreographed study program, to be read over a period of a year or two," Bernstein said.
So for a simple holiday gift, he'd suggest "How a Second Grader Beats Wall Street," by Allan Roth ($14.95) or "The Coffeehouse Investor," by Bill Schultheis ($15).
For a broader overview on how to manage money, not just lessons on investing, David Weliver, editor of the blog, Money Under 30, likes, "I will Teach You To Be Rich," by Ramit Sethi ($13.95).
Retirement savings
Are you contributing to an individual retirement account but not putting in the maximum that's allowed this year?
"Frankly, that's the case for most 20- or 30-somethings," said Mike Piper, author of the blog, Oblivious Investor. So he suggests putting cash on your gift list, with the stipulation that it be used to fund a retirement account.
The most you can contribute to an IRA in 2014 is $5,500 ($6,500 if you're age 50 or older). Keep in mind, however, that contributions cannot exceed your earned income for the year. So, for example, if you only worked part-time in 2014 and your taxable compensation totaled $3,000, you can only contribute as much to your IRA. For more details, check out Internal Revenue Service Publication 590 at irs.gov .

Singapore allows Indian nurses from select collegesSingapore allows Indian nurses from select colleges
Amiti Sen
India and Singapore had agreed to get into MRAs in five areas to allow smooth movement of professionals back in 2005
AIIMS, CMC Vellore, Trivandrum Nursing College to be part of the mutual recognition pacts
New Delhi, December 2:  
Nurses trained in select medical institutes in India could soon be allowed to practice their skills in Singapore without any additional training in that country.
The All India Institute of Medical Sciences, CMC Vellore, Nursing College in Manipal and the College of Nursing in Thiruvananthapuram are some of the institutes which the Singapore Government has agreed to include in the mutual recognition agreement (MRA) to be signed with India, a Government official told BusinessLine.
“We hope to sign our first MRA in the area of nursing with Singapore soon. Singapore too has drawn its list of institutes that it wants India to recognise,” the official said. An MRA is an agreement between two parties to recognise degrees or diplomas accorded by certain recognised institutes in the other country and allow professionals who acquired education and training from those institutes to practice in their own country.
Areas of cooperation
India and Singapore had agreed to get into MRAs in at least five areas to allow smooth movement of professionals when the two had signed a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) way back in 2005. These included nurses, doctors, dentists, architects and chartered accountants. But, not one has been signed till date. “We can’t lay the whole blame on Singapore. Professional groups here too are wary of opening up, fearing the unknown. Although we are very strong in services, it takes a lot to persuade our service providers to agree to free movement and convince them that we would be the net gainers,” the official added. While the Commerce Ministry has managed to convince the nursing fraternity to get into an MRA with Singapore after years of persuasion, efforts are still on to get things moving for other professions. “We don’t think anything is going to happen in the other areas soon, but efforts are on,” the official said.

Despite Queasy Ads  Coke Milk Has BenefitsEmail
A new Coca-Cola milk product is raising eyebrows not just for its health claims, but for its racy marketing.
"Fairlife" claims to have more protein and calcium and less sugar than regular milk, at twice the price.
That's spit-take worthy on its own. But to tout those facts, Coca-Cola rolled out a series of ads featuring women wearing barely-there "dresses" made entirely of milk. The campaign drew international headlines for its portrayal of women, which critics called "unoriginal" and "tediously sexist."
After negative reactions grew online, Coca-Cola this morning issued a statement to deal with the backlash.
Video: The beverage giant announced that next month, it’ll begin distributing what it being dubbed as a “high-end” milk. Their ads have made a splash online. Tamron Hall reports from the Orange Room.
"The 'pin-ups' advertising may have been eye-catching, but we’re taking a totally new approach," read an online statement  from the company, which noted the campaign was retired in early June. "We’re super excited about what’s to come."
Fairlife
Despite its splashy entrée onto the marketplace, Michelle Dudash, a registered dietitian, says Fairlife appears to live up to its hype as a healthful beverage.
“It has a lot of really good qualities,” said Dudash, author of “Clean Eating for Busy Families.” The beverage boasts it contains 50 percent more natural protein and 30 percent more natural calcium than regular milk, as well as 50 percent less sugar.
Fairlife
Bottles of Fairlife brand milk.
“And it’s lactose free,” added Dudash, an obvious boon to the millions of Americans who suffer from an intolerance to lactose and can't enjoy some of the health benefits that regular milk has been shown to have.
A diet that includes 8 oz. of milk a day is associated with healthy bones and teeth among other health benefits. A study by the University of Massachusetts at Amherst found that women can lower their risk of PMS by drinking either skim or low-fat milk all month long.
But sales of milk have been flattening out since the 1970’s and half of US adults don’t drink milk. One reason is that milk is perceived to be fattening and sugar-filled.
“Milk isn’t the enemy when it comes to sugar,” said Dudash. “But for diabetics and anyone who is really watching their carbohydrate intake closely, the 6 grams of difference between regular milk and Fairlife can be significant.”
The added protein and calcium also make Fairlife attractive, as it’s essential to have a diet that includes protein from a variety of sources including lean meats, nuts, seeds and milk.
“Fairlife, therefore, can be a good item to add to your protein portfolio,” said Dudash.
So how is it made?  According to Fairlife’s website, a sophisticated cold filtration system separates the milk into its components: water, fat, sugar, protein, vitamins and minerals. Then a new combination is created without lactose and more protein and calcium.
"It's basically the premiumisation of milk," Sandy Douglas, Coca-Cola North American SVP, global chief customer officer and president, said at a conference earlier this year. He added said Fairlife had the potential to make it "rain money" for the company.
Available now in Denver, Minneapolis and Illinois, Fairlife is slated to hit store shelves nationally in in 2015.

5 minutes with Fred SavageBy Helena Andrews December 2 Follow @helena_andrews
Actor Fred Savage speaks during a ceremony to donate memorabilia from “The Wonder Years” to the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History in Washington on Dec. 2. (Cliff Owen/AP)
Let this be a lesson to eye-rolling sons the world over. Those boxes stuffed with childhood memories currently going stale in your mom’s basement just might make it to the Smithsonian someday. So go the bragging rights of one Joanne Savage, whose son Fred you might remember from a little show called “The Wonder Years.” On Tuesday, the proud mom gifted memorabilia she’d kept from the iconic series to the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History.
For now, the museum has no immediate plans for a public exhibit, but just know that Kevin Arnold’s New York Jets letterman jacket (the same one that he smoothly placed on Winnie’s shoulders for that first kiss) has assumed its rightful place next to Dorothy’s ruby slippers in the pop culture pantheon. We caught up with Mr. Savage after the donation ceremony to find out what a normal former child star looks like. Hint: He led with: “I’m very happy for my mom. This is her moment.”
Truth, how annoying is it when people call you Kevin?
Honestly? I love it. I really do. To be a part of something that you’ve done so long ago that still resonates with people, it’s an incredibly gratifying thing. And it was a very positive experience for me. I’m very proud of being associated with the show.
To watch old re-runs or not to watch?
["The Wonder Years"] hasn’t been on TV in quite a while. It just came out on DVD this year. We have some at the house now and my wife is showing my kids. But I’ve been fortunate that I haven’t been in the position where I’m walking by a TV and I have to make the decision: Do I stay or do I go? It’s coming, though.
What’s it like when you do see 11-year-old Fred on the small screen?
It’s a lot like flipping through a yearbook or looking through an old photo album. You want to relive those memories, but you don’t want anyone catching you doing it.
Growing up in the bubble can’t be easy. Any advice?
It’s so different. I’m so glad I didn’t have to deal with all of that stuff kids have to deal with now. Part of growing up is making mistakes and doing stupid things and saying stupid things. I made a lot of mistakes, but they’re not preserved forever somewhere on a file.
Can you listen to “With a Little Help From My Friends” and not immediately think “The Wonder Years”?
I can’t. I wonder how Joe Cocker feels about that or Paul McCartney, for that matter. But to be linked with a song like that is pretty extraordinary.
Answer this question: What’s that Fred Savage up to these days?
I’m directing and producing TV comedy.
Also, can we agree that the iconic letterman jacket is basically baby-sized?
It’s so small, right? That was my first thing when my mom took it out of the closet, I was like, “No way.” It’s tiny. It’s insane.
Now no one can make fun of their parents for keeping old fifth-grade report cards. 
It’s so funny because now my mom is like, “See? I wasn’t crazy.” And I mean, just ’cause you kept the jacket doesn’t mean that keeping other stuff wasn’t crazy. I think some of it is. We can throw away that old printer. I know we can. I don’t think the Smithsonian’s gonna want it.

Lawmakers to give more time for smart grid despite unknowns
ComEd to get more time for smart grid. How is it doing so far?
The legislature this week is preparing to hand ComEd more time and money to invest in its smart grid rollout although it is too soon to know whether upgrades made so far are paying off for businesses and consumers.
The utility promised that operational savings from the smart grid and in-home devices connected to the network would ultimately save consumers money by giving them more control over their electricity use.
Commonwealth Edison has provided some information on overall grid upgrades. But no information is available yet about how new smart meters are benefiting consumers, a requirement under the 2011 law that allowed ComEd to proceed with the grid update.
A leader of a Naperville group opposed to “smart meters” was acquitted Wednesday of resisting police who arrested her last year after she shot video of them and meter installers. ( Clifford Ward )
David Kolata, executive director of the Chicago-based consumer advocacy group Citizens Utility Board, said lawmakers should have waited to see how the program is performing before acting on the legislation.
"We don't necessarily have the metrics yet, the reports yet to know how well it is working," Kolata said. "We don't see the need to do this."
8
Yet legislation, which has already passed the House in this week's veto session, is being pushed by Downstate utility Ameren and supported by ComEd. The legislation would extend by two years the date utilities were to check in with the legislature on the program's progress before they could proceed further. Tuesday afternoon the legislation passed the Senate executive committee and was forwarded to the Senate.
About $784 million has been spent on the 10-year $2.6 billion ComEd program, according to a filing with regulators. The extension means ComEd can continue to spend rate-payer money on the program without legislative interference.
The extension also is important because it guarantees that ComEd can continue to hike rates according to a formula — which gives the utility faster and more frequent returns for investing in a smart grid — until 2019. The legislation is an amendment to House Bill 3975.
For its part, ComEd said it believes the program is "producing tangible positive results" but won't be filing information about how it is meeting several performance metrics until 2015, after it has a "full year of smart meter data."
At the same time, several programs aimed at supporting and developing new businesses that would tie into the smart grid remain in their infancy.
In selling the legislature on the formula-based rate system in October 2011, ComEd pledged to digitize the electrical grid in an initiative that would lower costs and give consumers more control over their bills.
0
"Illinois' grid modernization law is a promise of value made to Illinois consumers," Anne Pramaggiore, ComEd president and then chief operating officer said at the time. "These performance metrics hold ComEd financially accountable to deliver on that promise."
The reason ComEd won't report on the progress of those promises until 2015 is because it battled with regulators over how it should be paid for the program. That delayed the smart meter rollout.
The metrics, annual goals that the utility will be graded on, are subject to approval by the Illinois Commerce Commission and include a requirement that ComEd eliminate estimated billing by 90 percent, eliminate consumption by inactive meters (electricity for which there is no customer to bill — an expense that all ComEd customers pay) by 90 percent, eliminate energy theft by 50 percent and reduce bad debt and unpaid bills by $30 million.
ComEd said that information will be filed with the ICC in 2015, once it has a "full year of smart meter data."
ComEd plans to be finished with the smart grid investments in 2018, according to regulatory filings, but ComEd must continue to report on its performance even after that date to keep the formula rate.
ComEd said it believes the program is working as intended.
"From a ComEd perspective, we are seeing the benefits," said Tom O'Neill, senior vice president of regulatory and energy policy and general counsel. "There was some delay in getting going, but we as a company have worked hard to move ahead and we did accelerate smart meter deployment."
Through October, ComEd said grid modernization has helped avoid more than 1 million outages and reduced the frequency of outages by 19 percent.
ComEd said hardening lines and wires, which makes them more resistant to downed tree limbs and contact with animals, has reduced restoration times by 30 percent.
Other smart grid initiatives are still being tested.
For instance, three years after the smart grid legislation passed, ComEd is just starting to see companies begin to test smart technology on its "Smart Grid Test Bed," a portion of its system that has been outfitted with smart meters.

Could Lithium Ion Batteries Pose Fire Risk on Passenger Planes
The Pakistani origins of the Israeli stateBy Ishaan Tharoor December 3 Follow @ishaantharoor

"Pakistan is like Israel, an ideological state," said then Pakistani President Zia ul-Haq in 1981. "Take out the Judaism from Israel and it will fall like a house of cards. Take Islam out of Pakistan and make it a secular state; it would collapse."
It's a strange thing to think about now. Pakistan and Israel are, on the face of it, not kindred spirits. There are no formal diplomatic relations between the two countries-- Pakistan, like many other Muslim-majority states, does not recognize Israel's existence. Israel, meanwhile, has in recent years been cozying up to India , Pakistan's archrival across the border. Pakistani conspiracy theorists routinely hurl invective at the combined plots of RAW, India's top intelligence agency, and the Mossad.
But Zia, an instrumental figure in the Islamization of Pakistani society, was saying something quite obvious: Pakistan and Israel are historical twins.
They emerged as independent states one after the other -- Pakistan in 1947, Israel in 1948 -- following the retreat of the British empire. They were born in blood: Pakistan in the grisly Partition that cleaved British India in two, Israel in the battles of the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. And ideologically, as Zia noted, they were both states whose raison d'etre was religion, or at least religious identity.
Pakistan was dreamed up as a haven for Indian Muslims, a state that transcended geography itself with a western and eastern wing suspended in between thousands of miles of India. (It should be noted that India's secular founding founders never saw their own state as a "Hindu" nation, and that for decades thereafter, there were more Muslims living in India than in Pakistan.)
Israel was the product of decades of Zionist activism, brought into being after the horrors of the Holocaust as a homeland for Europe's tormented Jewry. Even this cause had an echo in South Asia. Pakistan's founding father Mohammad Ali Jinnah was well-versed in the Zionist plight, since he too wanted to make a nation out of a religious community.
As the Oxford historian Faisal Devji writes in his book " Muslim Zion: Pakistan as a Political Idea ," Jinnah "seems to have possessed more books on the problems of European Jewry than on any Muslim people or country." That's not too surprising, given that Jinnah was not particularly religious and envisioned a Pakistani nation that, while defined by Islam, was not necessarily governed by its laws. A similar secular theme ran through the Israeli state.
More tellingly, Pakistan made a direct impression on Israel's rulers in the first years of the country's existence.
In a Haaretz article excerpting work from a new book on Israel and the question of apartheid, South African-born author Benjamin Pogrund explored how Israel followed Pakistan's lead when it came to administering lands and property captured from the Palestinians who had lived there before. Pogrund writes of the challenge that faced David Ben-Gurion, Israel's first prime minister, in 1948:
In the government debates to decide what to do with the Arab "abandoned property," the prime minister’s special adviser on land and border demarcation, Zalman Lifshitz, argued for the permanent use of refugee property for the political and economic benefit of the new state. He said that countries in similar situations, such as Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia, had taken on vast powers to liquidate refugee property for state use and he urged the Israeli government "to proceed in a similar manner" as "there is no shortage of precedents."
The laws Lifshitz got enacted in 1949, Pogrund writes , were "based squarely" on Pakistani precedent. During Partition, millions of Hindus and Sikhs had fled what became Pakistan, leaving behind property and assets that could be appropriated on behalf of the millions of Muslim refugees streaming in from the other side of the border. For Lifshitz, Pogrund explains, a similar solution made sense for Israel's Jewish arrivals.
It cannot be said if Lifshitz was aware of the irony of the new Jewish state using the legal techniques of a new Muslim state to deprive its own mainly Muslim refugees of their properties. Whichever, he proposed "a new law, similar to the… Pakistani regulations and based on the principles they contain." Pakistani lawmakers, he noted, had drawn on Britain’s Trading with the Enemy Act, but had also introduced new elements to assist expropriation and transfer of ownership: they had created a mechanism for seizing Hindu and Sikh refugee property in Pakistan and its reallocation for the settlement of Muslim refugees from India.
This curious irony could be chalked off as a quirk of history. But both Israel and Pakistan are still grappling with their fragile ideological identities to this day.
Jinnah's dream has so far proved illusory: in 1971, East Pakistan split away following a brutal revolutionary war and became the independent state of Bangladesh. Ethnic and linguistic nationalism trumped a pan-Islamic identity. Subsequent Pakistani governments have both encouraged rampant Islamism and then struggled to contain its extremist, militant off-shoots.
In Israel, the question of how to reconcile with the Arabs on its borders and in its midst remains as potent and vexing now as it did more than half a century ago. As WorldViews has written about before, the right-wing government of current Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has shown little will to enable the creation of a viable Palestinian state. Some of Netanyahu's allies have specifically ruled it out.
And Netanyahu himself is attempting to push through a controversial law that would cement Israel's status as a "Jewish nation-state," privileging the collective rights of Israeli Jews over the interests of Israeli minorities. It's a proposal that plays well among Israel's right-wing, including communities of settlers living in the West Bank.
But it has its critics, too. "Israelis not in the thrall of settler fanaticism need to decide whether they want to be part of the democratic Western world or not," wrote Israeli intellectual Bernard Avishai in the New Yorker this week. He then offered this tidy comparison: "The Jewish nation-state law puts the choice starkly: a globalist Hebrew republic or a little Jewish Pakistan."

Travel consultant booked for faking documents for USvisasWritten by Johnson T A | Bangalore |
Posted: December 3, 2014 7:30 pm
The owner of a travel consultancy in Bangalore who supplied fake documents to people aspiring for US visas has been arrested by the Central Crime Branch (CCB) of the Bangalore police on the basis of a complaint by US consulate authorities. The arrested person has been identified as Ravi Tejas alias BK Ravi, 45, a resident of Mathikere in North Bangalore.
Following a raid on the travel consultancy Citizens Comfort Services operated by Ravi Tejas the CCB police have seized non-judicial stamp papers and letterheads in the name of over a dozen fake companies. The probe into the racket of the supply of fake documents was carried out on the basis of a complaint filed by the US consulate in Chennai, the Joint Commissioner of Police (crime) Hemanth Nimbalkar said.
The police have arrested Ravi Tejas who is the managing director of Citizens Comfort Services. Ravi Tejas forged documents required for the US visa process by using the letterheads of many fake firms and sold these documents at prices ranging from Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 5 lakh.
The US consulate in Chennai found fake supporting documents in the possession of many people who were seeking US visas and filed a complaint as a result, the joint commissioner of police said.
A case has been registered against Tejas at the Yeshwanthapura police station under various sections of the Indian Penal Code including cheating.

Govt to sell 5% stake in SAIL | Construction: FDI norms easedGovernment to sell 5% stake in steelmaker SAIL on December 5

Disinvestment
(The stake sale will help…)
NEW DELHI: The government's disinvestment plan will kick off on Friday with a 5% stake sale in Steel Authority of India (SAIL) as it looks to raise a record amount from asset disposals with barely four months to go in the current fiscal year. The government may raise around Rs 1,700 crore through the sale, going by the stock price.
The company informed stock exchanges about the proposed stake sale to be held through the offer for sale (OFS) route on December 5 and said the government will decide on the floor price for the issue on Thursday.
In July 2012, the UPA Cabinet had approved a 10.82% stake sale in the staterun steel maker. The first tranche of disinvestment was completed in March The company's stock closed at Rs 85.65 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) on Wednesday, down 4.67%.
The government currently holds an 80% stake in the steel giant.
The stake sale will help the company meet the listing norms of Securities & Exchange Board of India (Sebi), which require the government's stake to be lowered to 75%.
The sale of a 5% stake, or about 20.65 crore shares, of SAIL at current market price may fetch the government around Rs 1,700 crore.
The government has lined up stake sales in NHPC and Coal India besides ONGC in this fiscal year.
The government will divest a 10% stake in Coal India, in which it holds 89.65%. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, in his July budget, had proposed a record asset-sale target of Rs 58,425 crore. Of this,Rs 43,425 crore is expected to come from stake sales in governmentcontrolled companies and Rs 15,000 crore from those in which the government has a minority stake.
Last fiscal, the government could mobilise only Rs 15,820 crore through disinvestment against a budgeted target of Rs 40,000 crore. In 2012-13, of the Rs 30,000-crore target, onlyRs 23,957 crore was raised.

(More than half of the highly…)
MUMBAI: More than half of the highly over- leveraged top 500 companies would need more than a whopping Rs 7 trillion or $114 billion and three years to deleverage themselves, says a report India Ratings.
"If equity infusion is used as a means to deleverage, as many as 262 of the 500 top corporates would require a minimum equity infusion of around Rs 7,04,300 crore ($114 billion).
"But raising this amount will be a significant challenge given that between FY08 and FY14, less than half of this amount was infused as equity across these 500 corporates," India Ratings senior director for financial services Deep N Mukherjee said in a note.
If these companies were to bring down their leverage ratio to a prudent level, they will need around three years to complete the process, provided their debts do not rise from the FY14 levels, he said.
Mukherjee added, however, that the process will take five to six years if there is only a marginal uptick in the economy over the current level.
Of these, as many as 96 corporates, which are already tagged as non-performing assets or are undergoing corporate debt restructuring, will take 5-10 years to reduce their leverage to moderate levels, he said.
Out of these 96 companies, 62 will require a minimum equity infusion of Rs 2,41,000 (USD 39 billion) so as to improve their likelihood of remaining a 'going concern'.
This amount is well over the market capitalisation of a lot of these 62 corporates, Mukherjee said.
As such, equity could come in only if the current promoter -managers are changed or else these would continue to weigh down their lender's balance sheet for a long time, he said.
  The report warns that out of these 96 companies as many as 87 are highly vulnerable as they have very weak credit metrics and lack support of a strong group or parent, and therefore may be formally slipping into the stressed category.
At least 71 out of these 87 corporates will require an equity infusion of Rs 89,200 crore over the next six to 12 months if they were to prevent themselves from slipping into the stressed category.
And if no equity infusion happens, they will take five-eight years to moderately improve their credit metrics, Mukherjee said.
Of the 317 corporates which are not immediately vulnerable, 128 would require an estimated Rs 3.7 trillion. But if these companies chase growth opportunities by taking further debt, there is a strong likelihood of their overall credit profile deteriorating, he warned.

NEW DELHI: CBI, which had not charged Bharti Cellular Ltd CMD Sunil Bharti Mittal and Essar Group promoter Ravi Ruia , today defended in the Supreme Court the decision of a Special CBI judge to summon them in a corruption case related to allocation of additional spectrum during NDA rule in 2002.
"The fact that they were the controlling minds of the company are the matter of evidence. They have been summoned and they have an opportunity to seek discharge before the trial court," the counsel for the probe agency told a bench headed by Chief Justice H L Dattu.
The bench, also comprising justices M B Lokur and A K Sikri, is hearing petitions seeking setting aside of an order of the Special CBI Judge by which Ruia and Mittal, whose name did not figure in CBI's charge sheet as accused, were summoned on March 19 last year. The lower court had said that there was "enough material" to proceed against them in the case.
Senior advocate K K Venugopal, appearing for CBI, said, "we start with the assumption that there is a prima facie evidence against the accused companies. A person or a group of persons, who have been the guiding force behind a company, are responsible for the alleged criminal act of the company."
Managing Director and officials are the mind and nerve centre of a company and "guilty minds of directors or managers constitute the criminal offence of a company also", he said.
Referring to records, he said the agency has evidence that Mittal met various persons to get additional spectrum for the company (Bharti Cellular Ltd) but the same kind of proof was not available with regard to Ruia.
"I did not say that he (Ruia) cannot be proceeded against," he said, adding there are various options including that the agency can be asked to investigate further.
Lawyer Prashant Bhushan , appearing for an NGO, said there was enough material to summon Sunil Mittal in the case.
"The Investigating Officer, the Superintendent of Police, the DIG and the Joint Director of CBI have been of the opinion that there was enough material to prosecute Mittal. He had been in liaison with government officials and others," Bhushan said.
"The Special CBI Judge was right in issuing summons. Even in the absence of specific materials, it can be said that the act of the companies have been done by MD and others", he said.

Ask Matt: How to bail on stock certificatesAP
Q: How do I get rid of paper stock certificates?
A: The financial industry wants to banish paper. That includes your lovely paper stock certificates. But getting rid of them takes legwork.
The first step is turning your certificate into an electronic form of ownership. Brokerages have been burned by people opening accounts, mailing in certificates, selling them and then closing their accounts. To discourage this, most brokerages charge hundreds of dollars to process paper certificates. But if you you have an existing and long-term relationship with a broker, now’s the time to ask for a favor. Many will process paper certificates for free or at a reasonable cost for people who have been customers for some time. If you just want to cash in stock, and don’t have a brokerage, it’s best to work with the company’s transfer agent, or the firm with the job of tracking a shareholders.
Start the process by calling the transfer agent. You can then mail the shares to the agent, who will hold the shares digitally in an account for you. If you want to sell the shares, the transfer agent will do that for a cost. Computershare, one of the biggest transfer agents, will process your paper certificates for free, says Paul Capozzi of Computershare. Selling costs vary, but usually are $15 plus 12 cents a share.

Apple (AAPL) . Tesla (TSLA) . GoPro (GPRO) . These seem to be the only three stocks that matter to investors.  But fixating on these stocks leaves out all kinds of stocks that can ride these well-known companies’ success.
Investors wanting to avoid the pack are digging deeper to find “sidekicks” to these darling stocks that might have as much – or even more – potential upside. These sidekicks are stocks listed as suppliers to Apple, Tesla and GoPro that have market values of $4 billion or more with the most upside before hitting their 18-month price targets in S&P Capital IQ’s database. These are the “Robins” to the “Batmans” on Wall Street.
As the bull market ages, it’s increasingly important to distance yourself from the pack pushing darling stocks to nosebleed valuations. You’re not the first investor to consider buying shares of Apple, Tesla or GoPro. These stocks are the favorites of the current market and are racing higher as a result.
Here’s the problem. Chasing after stocks that everyone else is buying is usually not a good way to make money, since the higher the current price, the lower the expected future gains.
Apple is a great example of the price of popularity. The stock is up roughly 40% this year. But that means it’s already trading for about what analysts think the stock is worth. The current price is just 4% below the average analyst’s 18-month price target, says S&P Capital IQ. Shares have erased more than $20 billion in value in two days as investors readjust their expectations.
S&P Capital IQ doesn’t contain every supplier to these companies, as many relationships are secret. But investors can get a good idea of the companies that feed into these giants — and disclose having a supplier relations in regulatory filings.
APPLE’s sidekicks
Being a supplier to Apple can be like hitting the jackpot for many companies. Apple makes so many smartphones that supplying the giant is a huge source of potential profits. Apple closely guards its list of suppliers so it takes a big of guessing and regulatory filing diving.
The Apple supplier that analysts like the best is Korea’s LG Display. Analysts see that stock having nearly 20% upside before hitting the 18-month price target. But investors hoping to stay a little closer to home, audio equipment maker Harman (HAR) is listed as a supplier. The company’s stock has 18% upside before hitting analysts’ 18-month price target.

Delamaide: Wall Street nominee splits Democrats

WASHINGTON — Gridlock in Congress has already gotten worse in the wake of the midterm elections — not between Democrats and Republicans, but within the Democratic Party.
The unlikely catalyst for a new internecine war in the party is the nomination of a Wall Street banker to be the undersecretary of the Treasury for domestic finance.
The duties of this official include implementing regulatory reform and for anti-banker Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., that was one too many foxes in the henhouse.
"Enough is enough," she thundered in a blog on Huffington Post, castigating the president for consistently appointing Wall Street executives to key administration posts.
"The over-representation of Wall Street banks in senior government positions sends a bad message," she wrote. "It tells people that whatever goes wrong in this economy, the Wall Street banks will be protected first."
The nomination pits the populist, anti-Wall Street wing of the Democratic Party led by Warren against the centrist faction represented by Hillary Clinton, who reportedly collects as much as $300,000 a speech for Wall Street denizens and their ilk.
The nomination also exposed the bias in mainstream media as editorialists at The New York Times and Washington Post rushed to defend the nominee, Lazard executive Antonio Weiss, and demonize Warren as a misinformed and misguided populist.
It is a battle, in short, that puts Wall Street regulation at the center of the war in Washington and is the first sally in what may become a genuine challenge to Hillary Clinton's "inevitability" in winning the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016.
Warren objected to the nomination specifically because Weiss has spent the bulk of his career in global mergers and acquisitions — including a long stint based in Paris — that ill prepares him to deal with the domestic concerns of this post. Equally important, many of these mergers, notably Burger King with Tim Hortons of Canada earlier this year, were driven as tax "inversions" — transferring corporate headquarters abroad to reduce taxes.
Heaven knows why Weiss, who has amassed a fortune somewhere between $50 million and $200 million at Lazard, is even interested in the job. He has been a big donor and bundler for President Obama, and appointing Wall Streeters to top Treasury jobs is a hallmark of the Clinton tradition that Obama has adopted as his own.
You don't have to be a high-powered investment banker to do this job in Treasury. The most recent occupant of the post, the low-profile Mary Miller, worked for a quarter-century at fund manager T. Rowe Price in Baltimore, heading the fixed-income division before joining Treasury in 2010.
Senate Democrats, perhaps embarrassed by the tone-deafness of the nomination, are in no hurry to deal with it in their waning days in the majority. They seem to be quite happy to leave this Obama pick to the tender mercies of the Republican majority in the new Congress, which convenes Jan. 6.
Iowa Republican Sen. Charles Grassley, a member of the Finance Committee which will consider the nomination, gave a preview of what this Obama donor can expect.
"This nomination shows the continued hypocrisy of the Obama administration in this area," he said when Weiss was named in mid-November. "The president has put forward nominees with offshore accounts, which he lambasted on the campaign trail, and now someone who's been involved in inversion transactions, something he's referred to as unpatriotic."
It doesn't help that Lazard itself — a hallowed firm founded more than a century and a half ago with big operations in Paris, London and New York — moved offshore in 2005, reincorporating in Bermuda primarily for tax reasons.
New York Times business columnist and editor Andrew Ross Sorkin found Warren's "wrath" to be "misdirected" and her opposition to Weiss' nomination "misinformed." Moreover, her understanding of the Burger King deal was "mistaken."
Sorkin allows that the deal was "technically an inversion," but insists it was not "cynically constructed" — that is, it was not driven primarily by tax concerns.
Weiss, the Times writer argues, is not a "prototypical banker" because he was protégé of literary gadabout George Plimpton and is now publisher of The Paris Review, Plimpton's idiosyncratic quarterly.
Sorkin argues that the debt-financing role of the Treasury post — not the regulatory reform Warren is worried about — is the paramount consideration, though he should know that rolling over Treasury debt is a fairly mechanical business often handled at a junior level in Treasury. There is little scope for innovation or financial wizardry in Treasury auctions.
In case Times readers missed the point, Washington correspondent Jonathan Weisman weighed in a few days later with another panegyric for Weiss , saying he is being unfairly tarnished for his Wall Street resume when he is "more Daddy Warbucks than Gordon Gekko."
Not to be outdone in their defense of the Lazard banker, the editorialists at the Washington Post branded Warren's opposition a "populist witch hunt." So what if his tens of thousands in campaign contributions mean he is "wealthy and politically connected."
Weiss, the Post notes in his defense, was one of 11 authors who signed off on a "progressive" tax reform proposal from the Center of American Progress, a Clintonite group fixated on reducing the deficit.
Warren's focus is elsewhere, however, and Weiss doesn't fit in there.
"Neither his background nor his professional experience makes him qualified to oversee consumer protection and domestic regulatory functions at the Treasury," Warren wrote in her blog.
After her own career focused on domestic economic issue, she said, "I know how important these issues are and how much the people in Treasury can shape policies. I also know that there are a lot of people who have spent their careers focused on these issues, and Weiss isn't one of them."
Stagnant wages, student loans, fraudulent and inappropriate financial products — not a federal deficit that is already safely in decline — are the problems besetting Americans now, she feels, and a multimillionaire investment banker with a fondness for Paris is not the person to understand or address these issues, she feels.
The fight over this nomination is, in short, a struggle for the soul of the Democratic Party. Even if Weiss eventually squeaks through — a doubtful proposition at this point — it draws the battle line for the 2016 primaries.
Business columnist Darrell Delamaide has reported on business and economics from New York, Paris, Berlin and Washington for Dow Jones news service, Barron's, Institutional Investor and Bloomberg News service, among others.

Bezos Defends Amazon s Lack of ProfitsSpiceJet Cancellations Trigger Chaos At Airports
Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon.com Inc, was unapologetic about his twenty-year-old company's lack of profit during a rare public appearance on Tuesday, noting he spends just six hours a year on investor relations.
Bezos also discussed Amazon's acrimonious dispute with publisher Hachette Book Group and his purchase of the Washington Post. He acknowledged that Amazon had a succession plan in place, but remained tight-lipped about the details.
His comments come a day after Moody's Investors Service downgraded its outlook on Amazon to "negative," citing the company's upcoming debt offering and the "lack of visibility" about how the funds would be deployed.
Investors have grown increasingly unhappy about Amazon's spending and lack of disclosure about future plans. Its shares have fallen more than 18 per cent this year, despite a 14 per cent rise in the Nasdaq.
Bezos, relaxed in jeans and a gray jacket, defended Amazon's culture as one willing to spend on new projects, even if they flop like its poor-selling Fire phone.
"We are a large company, but we are also still a start-up. There is a lot of volatility in start-ups," Bezos said at a conference organized by the Business Insider blog in New York.
Bezos, an investor in Business Insider, defended Amazon's approach during its drawn-out contract dispute with Hachette, which came to light after Amazon delayed deliveries and removed pre-order options for several Hachette titles. The dispute was settled in November.
Publishers are in better shape because of e-books, which became popular after Amazon launched the Kindle e-reader in 2007, he said, adding that books are still too expensive.
"It's difficult for incumbents who have a sweet thing to embrace change," Bezos said. "Making reading more affordable is not going to make authors less money. ... It's going to make authors more money."
Bezos entered another embattled industry last year when he bought the Washington Post from the Graham family. He was initially surprised when approached about the sale, but said Don Graham convinced him. He plans to turn the Post into a national and international newspaper.
Bezos, 50, also acknowledged that there is a succession plan in place for him and his executives. When asked to reveal the next generation of leadership, he said: "It's a secret."

New Delhi: People will soon be able to go to Agra sailing on the Yamuna as the Centre has sought help from the Netherlands government for the ambitious project that includes building barrages and water-terminals on both sides of the river.
"Soon people can go to Agra via Delhi through Yamuna...We will float a Cabinet note within 10 days to specify works for the project by our Ministry and the Delhi Government," Road Transport, Highways and Shipping Minister Nitin Gadkari said.
"We will request Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to ensure special funds for the project," he said.
People will soon be able to go to Agra sailing on the Yamuna as the Centre has sought help from the Netherlands government for the ambitious project that includes building barrages and water-terminals on both sides of the river.
#nitin gadkari #yamuna #delhi agra route
After chairing a high-level meet to discuss the project, Gadkari said the Netherlands government has agreed to come out with a technical report for the project which includes specifications regarding construction of barrages and two water-terminals at both ends of Yamuna.
"Netherlands has expertise in this in the world. I had a talk with the Netherlands Ambassador. We have asked a Netherlands government agency to prepare the project management report including technical consultancy, for which they have agreed," he said.
Gadkari said barrages would be constructed to ensure at least five metres water in Yamuna round-the-year to ensure passengers and goods transportation through the waterways.
He added that more barrages would be constructed ahead of Wazirabad so that Delhi does not face water-crisis and if need be talks will be held with the Haryana government.
"We have already given nod to seaplanes. We are allowing hovercrafts. We are constructing water-terminals at both the ends of Yamuna on the pattern of airports," he said.
Unveiling the plans, Gadkari said Delhi Development Authority will beautify the riverbanks while the Delhi Jal Board will prevent effluents from being released in Yamuna.
Officials of the Ministry of Shipping in consultation with Delhi Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung will integrate the scheme, he said.
Gadkari said his ministry has accorded highest priority to development of waterways in the country which has been "sadly" ignored so far with the country's goods and passenger transport through the mode barely at 0.5 per cent of the total transport in comparison to China where the percentage was 20 per cent.
The stress is being given on waterways from Varanasi to Kolkata and from Delhi to Agra now in addition to the existing five waterways in the country, he said.

Takata and NHTSA to Face Off Before Congress
Huge opportunity for distressed hedge funds: JPM s Casey
How a trip to North Dakota spurred Obama to act on Native American issuesObama took students from the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe out for pizza in Washington. (Martin H. Simon/EPA)
This post has been updated.
When President Obama visited the Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Nation in June, he and first lady Michelle Obama emerged stunned and emotional from a meeting with six students who spoke of lives affected by homelessness, alcoholism, poverty and suicide.
"I love these young people," Obama said shortly after meeting them. "I only spent an hour with them. They feel like my own."
The Obamas emerged from the private conversation at a school in Cannon Ball, N.D., "shaken because some of these kids were carrying burdens no young person should ever have to carry. And it was heartbreaking," Obama said.
The meeting spurred Obama to tell his administration to aggressively build on efforts to overhaul the Indian educational system and focus on improving conditions for Native American youths.
"It’s not very often where I tear up in the Oval Office," Obama, speaking at the conference, said about speaking to his staff about the plight of the children he met. "I deal with a lot of bad stuff in this job. It is not very often where I get choked up, so they knew I was serious about this."
The administration unveiled a set of reports, programs and other initiatives to help Native American young people at the White House's sixth annual Tribal Nations Conference. They include a National Tribal Youth Network, which will provide peer support to young people, a gathering of tribal youths at the White House next year and efforts to help children prepare for college and career.
The White House also presented a report stating that Native American youths and their education system are in a "state of emergency," due in part to past "misguided federal policies," and that the educational, socioeconomic, health and other issues facing young people on reservations are "nothing short of a national crisis." Suicide is the second-leading cause of death for Native Americans ages 15 to 24, and more than one-third of Native American and Alaska Native children live in poverty, according to federal statistics cited in the report.
"It is very clear that the status quo is not acceptable," Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said.
In June, Jewell announced a plan to transition control of schools run by the Bureau of Indian Education to tribes. One third of those schools are in disrepair, Jewell said. Native American children lag behind on test scores and have extremely low graduation rates. The report calls for increasing tribal control of the educational system, providing student support services in schools, expanding suicide prevention efforts and bringing technology into the classroom, and some efforts are underway.
"I know there's a problem, the president knows it, (Secretary of Education) Arne Duncan knows it," she said. "We are committed to working with tribal leaders and communities to do something about it.”

Obama visited Standing Rock, which is in both North and South Dakota, to tout the strides his administration made with Native American tribes and unveil new economic and educational initiatives. But officials said the meeting with the six students and Obama's interaction with about a dozen others at Standing Rock, where at least half of students drop out of school, cemented Obama's desire to make  improving Indian education a priority.
"We were moved because they were like Malia and Sasha -- just as smart, just as hopeful, just as beautiful," Obama said.
"But at their core, there was a nagging doubt that they would have the opportunities that my daughters had. And nothing gets me more frustrated than when I hear that. Nothing gets me angrier than when I get a sense that our young people early in life are already feeling like opportunities are foreclosed to them -- because that's not who we are,"  he said.
As Obama sat with about 20 students at the tribe's Flag Day celebration, he asked them about Shoni Schimmel, a Native American women's basketball player. Obama then told the students that they should "come play on my court," according to Standing Rock chairman Dave Archambault II.
Last month, 18 students spent three days in Washington at Obama's behest, visiting the National Museum of the American Indian, attending a conference on Native American youths at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and going to a Washington Wizards game. The group spent two days at the White House, visiting the basketball court (no games were played), getting a tour of the Oval Office and eating lunch at a Washington pizza place with the president and first lady.
"Someone as big as the president of the United States cares about us," said Shayla Gayton, a freshman at Purdue University who came to Washington with the group. Gayton wants to be a psychologist after seeing how the deaths of two friends — one in a drunk-driving accident, another by suicide — affected her and her friends. "It was something that was really hopeful."
Obama's visit to Standing Rock was his first to Indian country as a president; he visited the Crow Nation in Montana during his 2008 campaign. He is the first president to visit Native American land since Bill Clinton in 1999; before him it was Franklin D. Roosevelt.
"President Obama's visit to Cannon Ball was historic," said Timothy Q. Purdon, the U.S. attorney for North Dakota. "It now looks like it could lead to a historically positive impact on the current generation of American Indian youth."
The administration also announced plans to improve infrastructure, expanding access to health care and ensuring that federal contractors hire Native Americans. While the conference, and initiatives that will be announced, have the weight of the president behind them, they also illustrate federal spending constraints and the sheer amount of money that it will take to fix decades of endemic poverty and substandard education on Indian reservations.
President Obama talked about how his visit to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Nation inspired his new initiative aimed at helping Native American youth during the White House Tribal Nations Conference on Wednesday. (AP)
"The reality is we don't yet have a budget" for 2015, Jewell said, and it is "difficult to say if we have the funding" until it is passed. The administration asked for $2.6 billion for Indian affairs, or $33.6 million more than it received in 2014.
Jewell said it will take more than $1 billion to fix schools that "are falling down." She said the administration is exploring public-private partnerships and working with philanthropies such as the Kellogg Foundation, which has funded educational reform efforts.
Tribes are also trying to become more self-sufficient, but past betrayals by the federal government and decades of crippling poverty have made trying to break away a daunting, if not impossible, task.
"We’ll hear them say, 'We know we're going to have to figure out a path forward for our people that doesn’t involve depending on the federal government, but how do you do that when you start in the hole?' " asked Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), who has long been active in Native American issues.
The attorney general’s Advisory Committee on American Indian and Alaska Native Children Exposed to Violence released a 120-page report two weeks ago after conducting four public hearings this year – in North Dakota, Arizona, Florida and Alaska. The report made 31 wide-ranging recommendations, but the overriding theme was to increase federal spending for the “vastly under-resourced programs” for American Indian and Alaska Native children.
Former North Dakota senator Byron L. Dorgan (D), who co-chaired the 13-member committee with Iroquois singer and child advocate Joanne Shenandoah, said that the U.S. government’s responsibility to Indian nations requires the provision of basic governmental services on reservations. But the funding for Indian reservations is in the discretionary portion of the federal budget, leaving vital programs underfunded.
“This should be mandatory funding,” Dorgan told The Post. “If you have a treaty and laws, how do you describe it as discretionary funding?”
Dorgan said that children on reservations are growing up in Third World conditions, in dilapidated housing mostly built by the Department of Housing and Urban Development decades ago.
Since the late 1990s, the Justice Department has been a key source of funding for tribal justice programs. But funding has been decreasing in recent years. Justice funding for a grant that provides the most services to children exposed to violence dropped from $25 million in fiscal 2010 to $5 million in 2014.
The Bureau of Indian Affairs, which is part of the Interior Department, is in charge of providing funding for tribal court systems. But the report found that the funding “is far too low” and should be brought into line with spending levels on court systems in the rest of the country.
The Obama administration has, however, settled longstanding lawsuits with some of the nation’s 566 federally recognized tribes. In September – in the largest settlement with a single American Indian tribe – the administration agreed to pay the Navajo Nation $554 million to settle claims that the U.S. government has mismanaged funds and natural resources on the Navajo reservation for decades. Some of the claims between the U.S. government and the Navajo Nation, located in parts of Arizona, Utah and New Mexico, dated back more than 50 years.
The administration has made several other multimillion-dollar agreements with tribes since 2009 to settle longstanding grievances of Native Americans.
Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. spoke about the success that three tribes have had in implementing a historic provision of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization in 2013.
The provision, which was opposed by most Republican lawmakers, extended tribal prosecution authority over certain non-Indian perpetrators of domestic violence for the first time in more than 35 years. Since three pilot projects began on the Pascua Yaqui, Tulalip Tribes and Umatilla reservations, more than 20 criminal cases have been charged by tribal prosecutors against non-Indian domestic violence offenders, and several have been convicted.
But the federal government did not provide any additional funding to the tribes to take all the measures required to update their court systems to implement the new law,  according to tribal leaders.
"We pay for our own police, we pay for our own members to be incarcerated. We're paying for non-Indians to be incarcerated," said Deborah Parker, a board member of the Tulalip Tribe in Washington state. "We're paying for prosecutors and public defenders."

New York has essentially eliminated stop-and-frisk -- and crime is still downBy Philip Bump December 3 Follow @pbump
The New Republic has circled back to one of the hottest debates in 2013 politics (thanks to New York City having a somewhat interesting mayoral election): the effectiveness of stop-and-frisk as a policing tactic.
If you were asleep in 2013, stop-and-frisk -- or as the NYPD would have it, stop-question-and-frisk -- was a policy under which New York police could interrogate and search people under extremely vague criteria of suspicion. (To get a sense of that vagueness, spend a minute browsing this Twitter account , which uses real stop-and-frisk reports.)
The only problem with The New Republic's story is that it doesn't live up to its headline. "NYC Police Said Stop-and-Frisks Reduce Violent Crime," it is titled. "This Chart Says Otherwise." Then it shows this chart -- which doesn't offer any data on actual crime rates.
Compiling that data isn't hard, although it takes a bit of digging. The New York Civil Liberties Union has detailed data from the NYPD on stop-and-frisks. The state publishes annual crime data , through 2013. And the city has year-to-date figures .
So this chart actually shows that the number of stop-and-frisks isn't related to the crime rate.
Since the numbers of crimes are (happily!) low, we can also look at it as a rate-of-change. If crime was tied tightly to the number of stop-and-frisks, we'd expect to see the red bars (crimes) drop as the blue bars (stops-and-frisks) rise, and vice versa. We don't.
But the most robust illustration is what has happened over the course of 2014, versus 2013, as stop-and-frisks have all but vanished under Mayor Bill De Blasio (D) (who took office in January). In every major crime category, crime rates have fallen.
There's value to this assessment outside of the utility of stop-and-frisk (which, we will note, isn't disproven by the lack of a correlation here, just severely undermined). For example, former mayor Rudy Giuliani (R) has made a new career getting on TV to talk about how he knows all about crime and its causes since he oversaw a steep decline in the city's crime rate -- using things like stop-and-frisk. But it's also very clear that Giuliani benefited from the fact that New York City crime rates were already falling before he took office, as they were nationally.
In fact, there are competing theories as to why crime rates fell. Based on the data at hand, however, it's safe to say that the role of stop-and-frisk in that dip is far from proven.

Can the new Republican Congress stop itself from undermining the 2016 GOP nomineeComments
By Paul Waldman December 3
The Post reports this morning that GOP leaders have settled on their strategy for avoiding their most immediate problem: Getting through the lame duck session of Congress without a government shutdown. The plan provides for a vote to condemn Barack Obama’s executive actions on immigration, an omnibus bill funding all the government except the Department of Homeland Security through next September, and a short-term bill for DHS that would last only until March, when the fight with Obama over immigration could be renewed.
But conservatives are now rebelling , leaving the plan’s fate uncertain. As the Post report notes, “recent success at the polls has done little to calm the internal rancor among congressional Republicans, who remain deeply divided over how to respond” to Obama’s executive action.
This serves as a reminder of how difficult it will be for congressional Republicans to aid in the accomplishment of the one goal that would make all their infighting and gnashing of teeth worthwhile: The election of a Republican president in 2016.
The truth is that there’s very little the Republican Congress can do to help the GOP revive its image or get its 2016 nominee elected. But it can do plenty to undermine those goals.
In October 2010, Mitch McConnell said : “The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.” Democrats repeated the quote often as evidence that Republicans had no interest in getting anything done. Which was true enough, but McConnell hadn’t really said anything shocking. It’s awfully hard to get the things you want done when the other party’s president is wielding the veto pen. Even with control of both houses of Congress, the single most important thing Republicans should want to achieve is winning the White House. There’s no issue — taxes, the safety net, abortion, health care, name any you wish — on which Barack Obama isn’t standing between them and the policies they’d prefer to see enacted. With a Republican president, the legislative doors would swing wide open, allowing them to rush through with a shout of triumph and enact almost any law they wish.
Compared to what they could do with a Republican president, the most they can accomplish now — hindering the Obama administration a bit here and there — is so inconsequential as to be almost meaningless.
The trouble is that their options for assisting the election of a GOP president are terribly limited. Picking fights with Obama won’t help, because it will reinforce the idea that Republicans are just obstructionists and enable the Democratic nominee to criticize their recalcitrance and irresponsibility. And it isn’t as the though the Republican nominee will be able to say, “Sure, those guys in Congress look like a bunch of reckless fools now, but elect me, and there won’t be any more fighting because I’ll give them everything they want.”
Just as the Democratic nominee will have to deal with the complex legacy of Barack Obama’s presidency — and will be helped or hurt by things like the economy’s performance over the next two years — the Republican nominee will have to answer for what the Republican Congress does. But the reality, fair or not, is that the more dramatically reckless Congress is, the more news it will generate and the more it will be a campaign issue, while if it did its work soberly and responsibly, that wouldn’t help the GOP nominee much, either. Indeed, if Congress actually cooperated with President Obama on any major legislation, it could make the status quo — Democrats holding the White House, Republicans holding Capitol Hill — seem like it isn’t so terrible. Which is just about the last thing Republicans want (short of voters putting Democrats in control of both).
Boehner and McConnell will have to walk the tightrope they’re on right now many times in the next two years. On one side lies the self-immolation of shutdowns and debt ceiling crises — in other words, fighting Obama so hard they end up harming only themselves. On the other lies capitulation that comes too quickly, which creates a rebellion on the right. Neither one would reflect well on them.
The best thing for the Republican presidential nominee would be if Congress were quiet and efficient — no shutdown crises, no move for impeachment, nothing that makes them look out of control. Pass a few uncontroversial bills, let nominees through, negotiate a compromise with the White House here or there to keep things moving, but don’t make enough of a fuss to attract too much attention.
Does anyone think that the Republicans in the new Congress — who will be even more conservative than the current ones — are capable of that kind of self-control?

Why I stopped shaming online harassersBy Alyssa Rosenberg December 3 Follow @AlyssaRosenberg
As someone who has been writing on the Internet a long time and has the e-mail inbox and Twitter mentions to show for it, the first thing I felt when I heard of Alanah Pearce was sympathy and a bit of admiration for her chutzpah.  Pearce, an Australian journalist who writes about video games, had decided to handle the young men who sent her rape threats online in a novel way: she started getting in touch with their mothers and let the women know what their sons had been getting up to in their spare time. With just a few text messages, Pearce shrunk her harassers down from unaccountable monsters to boys who were still subject to scoldings from their parents.

But after a while I started to feel guilty about my enjoyment of the story. I have never called anyone’s mother to get them into trouble, but I have used the Retweet button or blog posts to point readers to people who were saying ugly things about me online. Pearce and I may have used different methods, but we were trying to do the same thing: make the people who hassled us feel like they couldn’t troll with impunity.
The Internet is a combative place with feisty, creative participants on both sides of every major debate. And while I generally agree that freedom to speak does not mean freedom to speak free of consequences, lately I have been wondering about some big questions that lurk behind these kinds of headlines: What kind of speech should trigger consequences? What should those consequences be if the government is staying out of it? And who gets to administer them and how?
Pearce got in touch with these women on her own, rather than drawing in support from across the Internet. But not everyone behaves the same way. Thanks to social media, it’s very easy to set large numbers of people on an individual who has erred. But it is much harder to determine what consequences that person ought to experience and who ought to mete them out.
For Justine Sacco, a public relations executive who violated the tenets of her own profession by posting a stupid, racially charged joke and then failing to apologize for it quickly enough because she was on a long plane flight, the penalty the Internet exacted was the loss of her job. When author Daniel Handler used his presenting spot at the National Book Awards to talk about African Americans’ supposed affinity for watermelon, the price of his penance was a $10,000 donation and a pledge to match an additional $100,000 in gifts to We Need Diverse Books. Not every author would have been able to offer so much.
These kerfuffles have tended to proceed on a case-by-case basis, with critics declaring that Paula Deen should lose endorsements because of a wage theft and discrimination case, or calling for Bob Costas to be fired after discussing gun control and the murder-suicide of Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Jovan Belcher during halftime on “Sunday Night Football” in 2012. And we have yet to set workable precedents for what the social consequences should be for people who have little in the way of influence or power, but who team up to harass others, or who say foolish or ugly things online.
And it’s not just determining the social consequences that fit the offense that gives us such fits. Who gets to pass judgement? And who gets to carry it out? Being an activist consumer or calling attention to a troubling online conversation can feel like an opportunity for busy people to chip away at larger issues. And standing up to the offender of the day can be a satisfying way to reaffirm membership in an online community. But if everyone has deputized themselves to punish dangerous speech, it’s awfully hard to build a consensus about when a point has been made or a target has been sufficiently called out and educated. And without that consensus, it’s difficult to call off a hunt once it has begun.
We also have to figure out what the consequences ought to be when someone becomes a target in error. Recently, a woman named Brianna Rivera became a target after a vengeful ex-boyfriend changed his Facebook profile to resemble hers and wrote racist statements under her name. As Sam Biddle writes at Gawker , the man was not just trying to be personally unpleasant: he was counting on Rivera becoming a target of a site like Racists Getting Fired and losing her job and privacy.
“Before the site realized the trick and issued something resembling a correction, the Brianna smear racked up tens of thousands of reblogs and notes and prompted readers to bombard the real Brianna’s workplace with phone calls and tweets,” Biddle explains. “Probably because RGF provided instructions on doing this exactly. AMC Theaters provided a statement defending Brianna, but how many rabid Tumblr detectives read this?”
Rivera’s ex certainly deserves social sanction for making her life miserable. But the Racists Getting Fired Web site and the folks who piled on Rivera just as her ex wanted them to also bear responsibility for the incident. The prospect of holding any of them accountable in any way seems remarkably slim.
Knowing that you want someone to hurt or to be embarrassed for his or her bad behavior is not the same thing as having a clear sense of justice and proportionate consequences. In between our outrages of the day and articles mocking people for saying stupid things on social media, we ought to make time to figure out our actual standards of discourse, rather than pausing only to select our next target. Until we get a better handle on these precedents, I’ll be sticking to my Mute button rather than reaching for Retweet to expose angry people to a wider audience which might feel moved to chastise them. Knowing that the people who want to say ugly things about me online are shouting into the void feels like punishment enough.

What can Ashton Carter doBy Jennifer Rubin December 3 Follow @JRubinBlogger
Ashton Carter. (J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press)
The best man — perhaps the only man — who would take the defense secretary post under President Obama got it. Ashton Carter is the quintessential professional, liked and respected by lawmakers in both parties :
“He is very, very qualified,” said retiring Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) Chairman Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich.
A list of defense-minded GOP lawmakers echoed Levin’s assessment, including Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., who will be a member of the Republican majority on SASC that would run Carter’s confirmation process. . . .
Every interaction with GOP defense lawmakers on Tuesday could be summed up by Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., an armed services committee member.
“He’s well-respected in the defense community,” Blunt began when asked for his reaction to the Carter scuttlebutt.
He then immediately pivoted to criticizing the Obama administration.
“But, at the end of the day, it’s hard to get someone to help you implement your strategy when you haven’t defined what your strategy is,” Blunt said.
He hinted that Republicans would make the confirmation process mostly about Obama and his foreign policy and national security track record.
“And that will be [Carter's] biggest challenge I would think before the armed services committee and the Senate: Trying to explain what the president’s strategy really is and what they intend to do,” Blunt said.
Republican lawmakers praised Carter’s résumé and experience inside the Pentagon — but everyone interviewed for this article said for the next defense secretary to survive the remaining two years of Obama’s tenure, the president must change his approach.
“He’s a good guy,” retiring House Armed Services Committee (HASC) Chairman Rep. Buck McKeon, R-Calif., told reporters of Carter Tuesday morning.
“It’s not the secretary. It’s the president,” McKeon said. “And he’s going to keep going through these guys unless they do just whatever he tells them to do.
The Post recapped Carter’s qualifications: “Formerly the No. 2 at the Pentagon and before that its chief weapons buyer, Carter was passed over for the top job in early 2013 when it went to Hagel instead. Carter stayed on for a year as deputy defense secretary – essentially, the chief executive of the Pentagon bureaucracy – but his relationship with Hagel was seen as awkward. . . . He did not serve in the uniformed military but first joined the Pentagon in 1981 as a civilian analyst, working on missile defense, the nuclear arsenal and programs to ensure the continuity of government in the event of nuclear war. One of his early projects was to assess the merits of a pie-in-the-sky scheme to make it difficult for the Soviet Union to track MX missiles by deploying them on giant blimps over the United States.”
This does not mean his confirmation hearing will be unimportant. Far from it. It is a unique opportunity to get some insight into what this administration is doing and whether there is any recognition that things have gone horribly wrong. Even a partial list of questions reflect the serious inadequacies and missteps in national security:
What defense budget amount would be sufficient to respond to the threats the Pentagon and the bipartisan National Defense Panel have outlined?
If we remain on the current trajectory, what risks do we run, and what would be the impact on national security?
What is a viable plan for defeating the Islamic State in as short a time as possible? Do we have the luxury of time or is the Islamic State growing more adept, powerful and wealthy as time goes on?
Without 10,000 to 20,000 U.S. boots on the ground, can the Islamic State be defeated?
What is the threat to the homeland from the Islamic State?
Have terrorist threats grown or lessened in the last 6 years?
How many American deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan can be attributed to Iran from IED’s and other weapons?
Is Iran threatening its neighbors? Is it still the leading state sponsor of terror?
Is any detente possible with the regime as currently constituted without a dramatic change in its international conduct and internal human rights policies?
Is Iran closer to a bomb than it was 6 years ago? What is the current breakout time?
Did the interim Iran agreement require the regime to destroy or dismantle any equipment? Could any steps taken be reversed in a matter of days?
Is Iran currently cheating on the Iran interim agreement? Has it fully cooperated with IAEA inspectors?
Without a full accounting of its past program, how can we set up an effective inspection program?
Iran plainly does not feel compelled to give up its nuclear ambitions. How can we apply more pressure?
What have we done and could we do to make the military option more credible?
What would you do to enhance cooperation with and earn back the trust of Sunni states?
Have we lost Crimea to Russia? Is there any viable plan to reverse its conquest?
What steps are we taking to shore up support of NATO and non-NATO allies?
The national security failures are grave and numerous, and will not be solved without a new commander in chief. But with Carter perhaps matters will not deteriorate further and the trust between the Pentagon and civilian leaders can be repaired. If nothing else, we should get some straight answers.

Landfall or not Forecasts disagree on path of dangerous Typhoon Hagupit as it nears the PhilippinesBy Angela Fritz December 3 Follow @angelafritz
There is still a lot of uncertainty in the potential track of Typhoon Hagupit on Wednesday. The dangerous storm could make landfall in the Philippines over the weekend. (NASA)
A dangerous typhoon is gaining strength in the west Pacific Ocean, seemingly on a collision course with the Philippines, where it could make landfall later this week.
Typhoon Hagupit, which took shape in the Pacific on Sunday, is a strong typhoon with sustained winds of 115 mph — the equivalent of a category 3 hurricane.
On Wednesday, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center was forecasting a track for the typhoon that curved north before reaching the Philippines. But the forecast is anything but certain at this point, as forecast models have been in disagreement on the expected path of the storm over the past few days.
Even now with the storm just days away from reaching the islands, two of the best tropical forecast models – the U.S. GFS model, and the European ECMWF — offer two different solutions for the potentially deadly storm: one that makes direct landfall in the Philippines, and one that directs the storm away from the islands all together.
The track forecast from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (hurricane markers with dashed lines) steers Typhoon Hagupit north, avoiding landfall in the Philippines. However, the European model solution has the storm making landfall this weekend (color contours). ( Weather Underground )
The Joint Typhoon Warning Center’s forecast on Wednesday morning agreed with the U.S. model’s solution, steering the storm north before landfall. But the European model’s solution — which both the Japan Meteorological Agency and the Philippines weather agency agrees with — is much more ominous.
Forecast tracks from the Japan Meteorological Agency (left) and PAGASA, the Philippines weather agency (right). (JMA and PAGASA modified by CWG)
Despite the disagreement on the potential track, even the Joint Typhoon Warning Center is forecasting Hagupit to come within 100 miles of the central Philippines coast at its closest approach on Sunday — plenty close enough to be a threat, and well within the center’s average track forecast error.
However, what is in agreement is that Hagupit will likely slow down as it approaches the country, increasing the duration of the storm’s impacts, and with it the potential for widespread flooding. On Wednesday, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center’s maximum intensity forecast for Hagupit was the equivalent of a category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of 145 mph. If the typhoon does make landfall, that is likely close to the intensity at which it will come ashore.
While totally different in size/strength, it is amazing how PAGASA's fcst track for #Hagupit compares to #Haiyan . pic.twitter.com/SWaec2biLb
— Brandon Miller (@BrandonCNN) December 3, 2014
The threat of Hagupit comes just one year after deadly Typhoon Haiyan made landfall in the Philippines with sustained winds up to an incredible 195 mph. Haiyan is the deadliest typhoon on record for the country, having killed over 6,000 people.
In 2014, Typhoon Rammasun — known as Glenda in the Philippines — has thus far been the strongest typhoon to impact the island nation. Expected to be a relatively weak typhoon, Rammasun roared ashore over the provinces of Sorsogon and Albay on July 15 after rapidly intensifying into the equivalent of a category 4 hurricane.
GMA News in the Philippines reports that officials are not taking any chances with Hagupit, and have put 56 provinces on alert ahead of the storm:
“Definitely we will now strictly enforce forced evacuation,” said Jerry Yaokasin, vice mayor of Tacloban City in central Philippines.
“We have no more excuse, we have gone through Yolanda, and to lose that many lives, it’s beyond our conscience already,” he said, referring to typhoon Haiyan which left more than 7,000 dead or missing in November last year.

With the Rams  Griffin would fit a trendComments
By Gabe Hiatt December 3
Robert Griffin III, left, scrambling away from defensive tackle Kendall Langford, suffered his first pro loss Sept. 16, 2012 in St. Louis. Could he soon be trying to win there? (John McDonnell/The Washington Post)
For those wearing Arch-shaped goggles, Robert Griffin III could be looking pretty good right now.
There will be more than enough time to sort out the future of the quarterback who, in three years, has elicited an extreme gamut of reactions from Redskins fans and Mike Shanahan loyalists alike. Too much is up in the air to say Griffin is done in Washington, but let’s say for the sake of this observation Griffin’s career here is kaput.
Both Mark Maske and Grantland’s Bill Barnwell have listed the most ironic choice as a possibility for the quarterback’s next stop. That would be St. Louis, with the organization that decided it would rather have first- and second-round picks in 2012 and two more first-rounders in 2013 and 2014 than draft Griffin. The Rams will be in town this weekend.
Sam Bradford’s congruous situation to Griffin’s notwithstanding, here’s one simple reason St. Louis could be after Griffin:
In recent years, the Rams have shown a propensity to pick skill players who blossomed in college spread schemes.
In 2013, St. Louis drafted two wide receivers who enjoyed numbers inflated by Dana Holgorsen’s West Virginia wizardry: Tavon Austin and Stedman Bailey. The Rams were ahead of the game when they drafted Danny Amendola from Texas Tech’s run-and-gun offense in 2009. Donnie Avery, who had then-University of Houston Coach Art Briles to thank for fat chunk of his draft stock, caught 100 passes in two years for the Rams.
If St. Louis likes speedy spread receivers so much, wouldn’t it like a spread quarterback to throw to them? Wouldn’t the bubble screens and quick routes designed to get the ball in their hands be a good way to limit reads and stoke a quarterback’s confidence?
The other spread player worth mentioning is a Rams rookie who decided many a fantasy football postseason last week. Tre Mason had 164 total yards and two touchdowns last week. Last year, Mason  ran for 1,816 yards and 23 touchdowns for Auburn last year under Gus Malzahn.
Considering the effect Griffin has had on Alfred Morris’s production , especially running the read-option during their rookie years, couldn’t he do the same for Mason? Protecting Griffin’s blind side would be Greg Robinson of Auburn, who has blocked for Cam Newton and Nick Marshall. He’s also the final consequence of the original Griffin trade. Since this is all hypothetical, let’s go ahead and hire Art Briles as offensive coordinator.
The Rams like spread guys, but who knows? Maybe they don’t like Griffin. Jeff Fisher has had problems with humility-deficient quarterbacks before.

How the worlds biggest companies bribe foreign governmentsin 11 chartsBy Roberto A. Ferdman December 3 Follow @robferdman
Money talks. (Alexandre Meneghini/AP Photo)
Corruption knows no boundaries, or borders, according to a new study released by The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
The OECD analyzed 427 foreign bribery cases that were closed between 1999 and 2014. What the researchers found is a steady stream of illicit money exchanges between multinational businesses and public officials in both poor and rich countries.
"We have learned that bribes are being paid across sectors to officials from countries at all stages of economic development," the researchers wrote. "Corporate leadership is involved, or at least aware, of the practice of foreign bribery in most cases, rebutting perceptions of bribery as the act of rogue employees."
Although the number of foreign bribery cases resulting in a punishment has fallen since its peak in 2011, it remains historically high.
And there have been cases  affects at least 86 countries around the globe.
That should raise an eyebrow. After all, these are business executives and government officials who have actually been caught, meaning that they likely only represent a fraction of the total number involved in under the table cash exchanges. While the report doesn't name any of the corporations, finding one currently embattled by corruption accusations isn't hard. Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailers, is currently being probed for bribery in a number of countries, after the company disclosed potential violations in Mexico.
But what is truly unique about the study is the level of detail it uncovers about how the bribes are being paid, where they are being paid, why they are being paid, who is offering them, and to whom they are being offered.
Large multinational companies, for instance, appear to be much fonder of offering illicit cash for quiet favors than smaller corporate entities.
There are also certain industries, which appear more comfortable with—or, at least, familiar with—the practice than others. Nearly 60 percent of the foreign bribery cases observed happened in just four sectors: extractive (i.e. mining), construction, transportation and storage, and information and communication.
Senior management—sometimes even very senior management—was aware of, or complicit and even instrumental in more than half of the foreign bribery observed.
There are trendsnot only among the givers of bribes, but also among the takers.
The sorts of foreign public officials who were offered or solicited bribes ranged from employees of state-owned or controlled businesses to customs, health, defense, tax, and transport officials, and even heads of state. Some—namely, the employees of state-owned or controlled businesses—were much likelier to be involved in foreign bribery cases.
While employees of state-owned businesses were also the likeliest to actually accept a bribe, they comprised a much smaller percentage (some 27 percent) of all public workers who pocketed illegal money. Customs officials (11 percent) were second likeliest; health officials (7 percent), third; and defense officials (6 percent) were fourth.
The most common reason observed among the bribes was that companies wanted to gain an advantage landing public contracts with foreign governments—more than half of the time, the bribes were offered to win public procurement contracts. But a significant percentage—some 12 percent—were related to customs clearance—and another 6 percent were offered in exchange for favorable tax treatment.
In all, the bribes—whether merely offered or also accepted—amounted to more than $3 billion. Sometimes the bribes were huge—the costliest foreign bribe observed totaled more than $1.4 billion. Sometimes they were much smaller—the skimpiest was just $13.17.
Frequently, however, they significantly increased the cost of business. Bribes, on average, equaled more than 10 percent of the total transaction value and over a third of profits inherent in each transaction.
Multinational companies in the extractive (or mining) sector tended to pay largest bribes relative to the value of the related business, according to the OECD's findings, followed by those in the wholesale and retail sector, and those performing administrative service activities.
These extra (and illegal, for that matter) costs aren't always shouldered by the company—they can be levied onto the company's workers too. "In this context, the average of 10.9% of the transaction value spent on bribes means that the bribing individual or company would have to somehow recover or offset those costs," the researchers wrote. "Some companies might do this by paying employees less in countries with weaker employment laws."
But the costs are also borne by society, more broadly.
By bribing officials, multinational companies are in turn perpetuating a system that undermines the relationship between businesses and governments around the world, creating a form of corporate inequality where cash-rich corporations get all the breaks. In other words, it undermines both democracy and law, and funnels money away from otherwise moral companies and governments, and into the hands of corrupt officials and business owners.
There are, of course, significant obstacles in the way of correcting the system, and dissuading both multinational companies and government employees around the globe from offering, soliciting, and, ultimately, exchanging bribes. Among them is the reality that corrupt practices can be part of a culture.
"China is an environment where petty corruption is common and tolerated," Daniel C.K. Chow, a law professor at Ohio State University., told Bloomberg last year , in reference to China's "bribery culture."
Both Brazil and Mexico, two other developing economies, have also had to face uphill climbs  in their bouts with corruption.
But it'd be a mistake to assume that bribery affects just developing countries. Nearly half of the bribes observed by the OECD, after all, were paid not to officials in poor countries, but rather to ones in particularly rich nations.
Another part of the problem is that a lot of foreign bribery—and corruption more generally, for that matter—is hard to track, for obvious reasons. In lieu of concrete, reliable data, other organizations, like global corruption watchdog Transparency International, have created corruption indices based on perception , rather than proven reality. As the OECD notes, studies like theirs are but the tip of a much, much larger iceberg. A good deal of the data for even the concluded cases was unattainable.
"These preliminary findings indicate that the pressure on governments to step up their enforcement of anti-bribery laws and ensure that penalties for this crime are effective, proportionate, and dissuasive, is well-placed," the researchers conclude. "There has, indeed, been progress in the fight against foreign bribery, but clearly, much more must be done to be successful in this fight."

GOP voters turn against path to citizenshipBy Max Ehrenfreund December 3 Follow @MaxEhrenfreund
These people protesting illegal immigration now represent the majority of Republicans. (AP/Steven Senne)
New polling shows a major shift in public opinion following Obama's decision to delay deportations for some undocumented immigrants.
A year ago, Quinnipiac University polls show, Republican voters narrowly supported a path to citizenship over deportation, by 43 percent to 38 percent. Now, support for a path to citizenship has evaporated among Republicans, declining to 27 percent. Fully 54 percent support deportation, while another 15 percent say that undocumented immigrants should be allowed to stay but should not be allowed to become citizens.
Paul Waldman sees these polls as evidence that Republicans take their position from talking heads on television. When the right-wing media machine is firing on all cylinders, he writes, its audiences will believe anything.
At the same time, G.O.P. political strategists and conservative economists are probably also concerned about the Quinnipiac polls. The numbers show a party drifting toward an anti-immigration position that could harm the party's chances of winning the presidency.
It's too early to tell whether the shift toward deportations among Republicans is just a fluke that will disappear as tempers cool, or something more fundamental, but the answer probably depends on the party's leaders. If Republican politicians want to make a case to their constituents for comprehensive immigration reform sometime soon, and if they're able to speak with more or less one voice on the issue, they'll still find a sympathetic audience.

Senate Democrats aren't thrilled, but it seems that they'll go along. The question is whether conservative Republicans will support the plan. Robert Costa and Ed O'Keefe in The Washington Post .
Separately, House Republicans will pursue a largely symbolic vote on deportations. The measure sponsored by Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.), a large-animal veterinarian and an outspoken conservative, would strip Obama of his executive authority. Michael Bender for Bloomberg .
BEUTLER: Even shutting down the government wouldn't stop the executive action. Immigration agents don't need money from Congress to stop deporting people. The agency in charge relies on fees and can continue to operate even if the rest of the government closes its doors for a few weeks.  The New Republic . 
MILBANK: Republicans are backing down. Besides forcing the government to shut down, they have no way to meaningfully challenge Obama's decision on deportations, and that's a course they've apparently decided is too extreme.  The Washington Post .
The risk of more fiscal brinksmanship could upset the recovery. Even if the government is funded, there are all kinds of other budgetary deadlines approaching, including the highway trust fund, the Export-Import Bank, and more. The uncertainty about how these disputes will be resolved could discourage businesses from investing. Jonathan Weisman in The New York Times .
Meanwhile, advocacy and legal-aid groups aren't ready for the influx of applications. "In New York City, advocates expect more than 250,000 applications in the first few months, many from people who can’t find or afford lawyers and speak little or no English. How best to help them? With money, ideally from Congress, but that is a lost cause since the Republicans are not going to do anything to help unauthorized immigrants with legal problems."  The New York Times .
2. Top opinions
MATTHEWS: Reform conservatives dropped the ball on helping the poor. Obama threatened to veto a tax bill that did not include credits for the poor and the working class that some Republicans -- like Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Ohio) and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) -- had previously advocated for. When the chips were down, it seemed as though Republicans just weren't willing to spend the money. Vox .
GALSTON: Democrats need to ask questions about the future, not about the midterms they just lost. The party that can explain how to make college more affordable while giving the workforce technological training and how to encourage entrepreneurship while also equitably distributing the benefits of economic growth will win in 2016.  The Wall Street Journal .
WOLF: Lower oil prices come with risks. On the whole, cheaper fuel will stimulate the global economy -- but autocratic leaders of oil-exporting states such as Vladimir Putin could become desperate and dangerous as they lose a crucial source of revenue, and investments in energy efficiency will be curtailed.  The Financial Times .
FRIEDERSDORF: Police unions protect bad police. Around the country, unions appeal on behalf of officers who shoot and kill unarmed civilians, beat their wives or get drunk on duty. More often than not, these appeals succeed.  The Atlantic .
TRAISTER: Rolling Stone made mistakes, but those shouldn't obscure the truth.  The important thing is "that there are plenty of real stories of rape: of violent rape, frat house rape, gang rape, date rape; that most rape accusers do not lie and that in fact it’s quite likely, statistically, that Jackie herself did not lie."  The New Republic .
The District of Columbia's new streetcar line is more than a year overdue. Among other problems, the district chose an inexperienced contractor to supply the cars, turning down a quality Czech manufacturer for reasons that remain unclear.  The Washington Post .
BITTMAN: Chris Christie puts his presidential ambitions ahead of pregnant pigs. The governor vetoed a bill that would have outlawed gestation crates, which immobilize sows for years, in New Jersey. Banning the crates is the right thing to do, but Christie was apparently worried about how his signature on the bill would be seen in presidential primary states such as Iowa.  The New York Times .
3. Ashton Carter to be nominated for Defense Secretary
Carter is known for his experience with the bureaucracy at the Pentagon. He's a physicist by training who knows the guts of the Department of Defense. He understands the military's ballooning weapons-procurement costs and might be able to find ways to save money by focusing on actually useful projects. It's not clear how his appointment would affect foreign policy.  The Wall Street Journal .
He's also an expert on cybersecurity.  "A lot of our critical businesses are more vulnerable than they should be, and what should really happen is they should take the steps to harden themselves," he said recently, while also promising that the federal government was prepared to help defend against hackers. Andrea Peterson in The Washington Post .
4. Back to the drawing board with tax extenders
Congress will extend a slew of tax breaks only through the end of this year. They'll have to revisit the issue next year, after abandoning an effort to permanently write the breaks for special interests and corporations into the tax code following a veto threat from Obama. Republicans had been willing to consider the president's requests for tax breaks for the working class, but feared some of the money would go to undocumented immigrants who are paying taxes. Lori Montgomery in The Washington Post .
VINIK: Temporarily extending the breaks is the best among bad choices. "In the absence of tax reform, there isn’t a better way to deal with them. At the very least, some of the extenders will deliver mild benefits to the economy—and a larger deficit, in the short-term, is welcomed."  The New Republic .
Goodbye to a wasteful idea. Making the subsidies permanent after decades in which they've been extended annually would have been expensive and silly. Obama did Republicans a favor by threatening to veto the bill. They can start with a clean slate and pass a real corporate tax reform bill next year. The Wall Street Journal .
With no progress on tax extenders, the 113th Congress exits quietly. Lawmakers are avoiding big fights in the lame-duck session, but also all the hard work. Given how dysfunctional this Congress has been in the past, it certainly could be worse, but the lame duck was a missed opportunity to make progress on politically sensitive and important issues.  The Washington Post .
"Bonus depreciation" is an expensive lie. The tax break allows businesses to claim their equipment loses value faster than it does, which artificially decreases the income they pay taxes on. It doesn't work to stimulate the economy -- especially if when it is extended retroactively -- and it's surprisingly costly. David Super in The New York Times .
5. In case you missed it
Capitalism is broken. When firms compete for workers, wages rise, productivity improves and the economy is better off -- that's how the labor market is supposed to function. But even dog-sitters are now signing non-compete contracts. Matt O'Brien in The Washington Post .
But at least divorce rates are falling. At current rates, only a third of marriages since 2000 will end in divorce. Claire Cain Miller in The New York Times .
The first test flight of the spacecraft that could take us to Mars is scheduled for Thursday. The Orion, which is built for interplanetary travel, will launch from Cape Canaveral and orbit the earth twice before returning 4 1/2 hours later. The unmanned test flight will fly farther from the earth than any spacecraft in 40 years. Christian Davenport in The Washington Post .

SOME THOUGHTS
The RBI`s Monetary Policy yesterday came under criticism for the central bank`s stubborn attitude. All that was evident to investors was that the central bank was at loggerheads with a `growth concerned` government. Its unwillingness to bring down interest rates even as commodity prices and food inflation remained benign seemed odd. However what was lost on most of us were these facts.
It took the US government more than 205 years to accumulate its first trillion in debt in 1981.
It took less than 5 years to accumulate the next trillion.
And when the US government debt crossed US$ 18 trillion last week, it took less than 403 days to accumulate its most recent trillion! At this point government debt stands at 103% of US GDP.
And since the government is determined to keep printing money, one can only expect the trillion creating rate to accelerate in the days ahead.
So why should Indians and particularly the RBI worry about it?
Well, whether we like it or not, when the US sneezes, the global economy catches a cold. The possibility of the US government defaulting on social security, loans owed to banks, China etc is over 100%! And in such a scenario it is only prudent to expect that a mammoth sized global economic crisis is around the corner. By the time the US realizes the damage rendered to global economy, the emerging markets may hardly have enough safeguards to protect themselves. And it is none other than a prudent central bank that can foresee and prepare for such a crisis.
Dr Rajan is probably the only RBI governor to have adequately voiced his criticism on the US Fed`s policies. He has been doing so from the time, the grandfather of US QE, Alan Greenspan reigned the Federal Reserve. And while he cannot change the minds of Fed governors, the least that he can do is create safeguards for India.
The unwillingness to allow asset bubbles to be created in India by keeping the cost of capital fairly high is a move in that direction. Moreover as and when there is a flight of foreign capital, the attractive returns here may stem the outflow to some extent.

`Opportunity cost` is not a theoretical jargon, its a time-tested established concept in investment analysis (not just stock market investment).
Anyway, we will come to that later. Let me address the two points you made:
1. 4 cr I have obtained can become 1 or 2 in next 2 years - whats the scenario in which that will happen ? A full blown recession. And how would Spicejet fare in a full blown recession ?
2. Spicejet can go up 2,4,8,10 or even more from here - some facts : Current Macap : 1144 Cr, Rev : 6000 Cr. Now assuming Spicejet is able to post profits in FY17 (Optimistic case), my numbers are
9000 Cr revenue and 300 Cr profits( at 3% Net Margin which is what has been the highest profit posted by SJ till date - Fy11).
At 300 Cr profit, assuming market gives a trailing P/E multiple of 12 (Again optimistic), valuation comes to 3600 Cr which is a 100% CAGR from today`s price. Sounds good, right ? Here is the catch.
To even wipe out the negative networth, SJ needs a fund infusion of 1500 Cr into the company. Assuming this comes at a 30% stake sale, adjusted for equity dilution the MCap at 300 Cr suddenly becomes
2600 Cr. That implies a 50% CAGR from today. Taking the EPS route, SJ today has 58 cr shares outstanding. 30% dilution means issue of 25 Cr new shares. So total EPS of 300 Cr on a equity base of
83 cr comes to 3.6. A multiple of 12 times takes the stock price to 43.2 which is 50% CAGR. Please note that I am calculating basis P/E multiple only for ease of use. For a capital heavy business such
as this, a better metric would be to use EV/EBITDA in which case the multiples will be much lower.
For SJ to go up 4 times from here means a target price of 76, translating into profits of 525 Cr (P/E of 12, EPS of 6.33, equity base of 83 cr shares) . How much time do you think is needed for SJ to post that type of a PAT number ? How much capacity expansion is needed to achieve revenues that can enable SJ to post that kind of profit ? Will more equity dilution be needed ? Would that depress equity returns further ?
Now what are the risks being faced today : 1. No details on stake sale - quantum of funds, extent of dilution. 2. Hypercompetitive business, no significant pricing power. 3. Future direction of Oil prices.
4. To increase market share, capacity needs to be added - funds for capacity expansion will be through equity/debt ? Debt will reduce profitability, equity will dilute returns.
What is the opportunity today : 1. Hugely untapped market (domestic and international). 2. Regulatory and tax regime may become easier.
However, both the opportunities will apply equally to all players. In fact, an easier business environment will attract more players putting more pressure on pricing, which will in turn affect profitability.
The above is just a snapshot of pros and cons of investing in Spicejet today.
My only submission is that given the uncertainties, both on standalone business as well industry as whole, the risk reward equation for SJ is not favourable compared to other avenues in the market.
I am being practical and looking at the opportunity, but this isnt the only opportunity in the market. Yes, investing is about Conviction but the conviction has to be developed basis facts, numbers and judgement. Conviction without underlying support is shooting in the dark. In my opinion, sure SJ may seem short term bounces if and when the fund infusion happens, but there isnt enough conviction to invest for the long term. There are other opportunities which offer similar, if not higher risk adjusted returns. I am very particular about my Opportunity cost you see :).
To each his own !!

New Delhi, December 3:  
The Supreme Court has dismissed the Kerala government’s plea to review its May 7 verdict holding as safe the 120-year-old Mullaperiyar dam and allowing Tamil Nadu to raise the water level to 142 feet and ultimately to 152 feet after completion of strengthening measures on the dam. The apex court also rejected the plea for giving open court hearing and said there was no reason to interfere with the judgement of its five-judge Constitution Bench. “We see no reason to interfere with the order impugned. The review petition is, accordingly, dismissed,” said a bench.

Congress wants Modi to spell out stand on Sadhvi remark
New Delhi, December 3:  
The Rajya Sabha could not take up any legislative business for the second day on Wednesday, with the opposition parties intensifying their protest and demanding legal action against Minister of State for Food Processing Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti for her communal remarks in a recent BJP election rally here. The Minister had expressed regret in both Houses on Tuesday.
In the Lok Sabha, opposition members walked out of the House demanding a statement from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was also present. In the Rajya Sabha too, the members demanded that Modi explain his stand on the issue.
The agitated elders did not allow discussion on issues such as India’s stand in the WTO and the Prime Minister’s recent visits to foreign countries.
They argued that the House had been functioning smoothly till the Minister’s statement vitiated the atmosphere. Modi ought to sack Niranjan Jyoti, they said.
They further reiterated that her statement is punishable under the Indian Penal Code and an apology is not sufficient.
“The Minister should be sacked. This is an insult to the Constitution. The Prime Minister should inform the House that the Minister has been sacked,” said Congress leader Anand Sharma.
Past imperfect
Parliamentary Affairs Minister M Venkaiah Naidu, however, rejected the demand and said various leaders had made controversial remarks in the past. Modi has already expressed disapproval over the Minister’s statement and there is no need of any further action as she has already apologised, he emphasised.
Ready to relent
Meanwhile, informal discussions are said to be taking place between the Opposition and the Centre to end the impasse.
A section of the opposition leaders have told government floor managers that they will relent if the Prime Minister makes his stand clear on the issue. The Centre, however, sees no grounds for this.
The issue is likely to hurt proceedings on Thursday as well.

Mangaluru plans memorial park for air-crash victimsMangaluru plans memorial park for air-crash victims
Our Bureau
Tweet
Mangaluru, December 3:  
The Dakshina Kannada district administration has proposed the establishment of a park in memory of the victims of the air crash that took place in Mangaluru in 2010.
Chairing a meeting in Mangaluru on Wednesday, AB Ibrahim, Deputy Commissioner of the district, said that earlier it was proposed to set up a park on the premises of Mangalore International Airport.
Then some people suggested that it would be apt to set up the park at Kuloor – the place where 22 unidentified bodies of the victims were cremated – near New Mangalore Port. The site, which is in the custody of New Mangalore Port Trust, is situated between Gurpur River and national highway.
Ibrahim said the park would be set up on 44 cents of land. There will not be any permanent structure on the site.
Harinath, who represented the New Mangalore Port Trust, suggested that the district administration send a representation to the port. The Union Shipping Ministry’s approval is needed to hand over the land.
The Air India Express flight from Dubai overshot the runway on landing and fell over a cliff and caught fire on May 22, 2010. Of the 166 people in the flight, only eight survived. Of the 158 bodies, 22 remained unidentified. These unidentified bodies were cremated at Kuloor.

Unparalleled global response seen, says Sushma Swaraj
New Delhi, December 3:  
There is “unprecedented optimism” and a “new global confidence” in India under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said on Wednesday.
In a suo motu statement in the Lok Sabha on the Prime Minister’s recent foreign visits, Swaraj said that in “rarely seen” speed and resolve in India’s external engagement, the country has set “new milestones and reached new frontiers” in foreign policy.
“The global response has been just as unparalleled,” she added.
Since the previous session of Parliament that ended in August, Modi visited Japan, the US, Myanmar, Australia, Fiji and Nepal and met 45 international leaders “from every inhabited continent in the world”, the Minister said.
Rare scale
“In each visit, the Prime Minister reached out to people in every walk of life, on a scale rarely seen before during visits by Indian leaders,” she said, adding that these visits will contribute to the government’s mission of accelerating economic growth, boosting investment, creating jobs and transforming the quality of life of people.
Elevated relations
Following Modi’s visits, India’s relations with Japan have elevated to a “Special Strategic and Global Partnership”, relations with China have been “tangibly deepened” while focusing on outstanding issues, the momentum of strategic partnership with the US has been “restored”, a “new course” in relations with Australia has been charted out and the “hesitant” Look East Policy of the past has been translated into a “Proactive Act East Policy”, Swaraj pointed out.

Plea against appointment of TNERC chief  memberPlea against appointment of TNERC chief, member
Our Bureau
Tweet
Chennai, December 3:  
The functioning of the Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission and plans to hike power tariff could be stalled for some time to come with the Madras High Court admitting a Public Interest Litigation questioning the grounds of appointment of the Chairman and a member to the Commission.
Quashing of order
The petitioner has asked the Madras High Court to quash the government orders regarding the appointment of the chairman of the TNERC S Akshayakumar and that of a member G Rajagopal.
The PIL was filed by an advocate MG Rasool, on the grounds that the State Government has not followed the procedures as dictated in the Electricity Act 2003.
Also, both Akshayakumar and Rajagopal were previously employees of the electricity utility which they are now expected to regulate as part of the Commission. This could be prejudicial to their functioning, the petitioner said.
Akshayakumar was working at the Managing Director of Tamil Nadu Transmission Corporation, a transmission utility, when he applied for the post of chairman TNERC and was appointed to head the Commission within a week of his retirement.
Rajagopal was working as the finance director in Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation when he applied for a position in the Commission.
‘Conflict of interest’
There is a “clear conflict of interest” the petitioner said while seeking that their appointments are set aside.
Also, they do not fulfil the requirements of qualifications under the Act regarding ability to deal with problems relating to finance, commerce, engineering, economics, law or management, according to the petitioner. Both were in positions of responsibility in the utility which continuously has reported losses over the years.

Pharma cos to grow by 12% in FY 2014-15Pharma cos to grow by 12% in FY 2014-15
BS Reporter | Ahmedabad Dec 03, 2014 09:25 PM IST
The domestic pharma industry, which had clocked a 9 per cent growth last fiscal, has recovered the growth rate to 11.9 per cent in October this year, with a 2.6 per cent rise in the last six months period. Analysts expect the domestic pharma space to grow by 10-12 per cent in FY15.
A recent report from Centrum Broking said, "We expect the domestic pharma market to grow at 10-12 per cent in FY15 compared to 9 per cent in FY14. Domestic pharma market suffered in FY14 due to the adverse impact of National Pharma Pricing Policy (NPPP) and trade related issues, which have now been discounted.  We expect increase in prices of drugs in April 2014 to drive future growth."
Price increases along with rise in volumes and new product introductions outside price control will drive growth to 10-12 per cent in FY15, said Ranjit Kapadia, analyst Centrum Broking.
The domestic pharma growth rate recovered to 11.9 per cent in October 2014  from 9.3 per cent in April 2014 with 260 bps rise in six months period, the report claimed.
The growth was partly attributed to price increase of products both under price control and outside price control in April 2014.
It adds that twelve major pharma companies generated revenues of around 36 per cent in the domestic market.  
"Sun Pharmaceutical Industries and Lupin benefitted from their presence in fast growing niche therapeutic segments. MNC pharma companies Abbott (including Abbott Healthcare), Glaxo SmithKline and Pfizer had lower growth rates of 6.9 per cent, 4.5 per cent and 5.9 per cent respectively as some of their major brands witnessed price reduction under NPPP.
Further, analysts feel that drug price revision will improve growth. Pharma companies raised prices of price controlled drugs by 6.3 per cent in line with the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) in April 2014. 
Similarly, for products outside price control, drug prices have been raised up to 10 per cent. "We expect fast growing anti-diabetic and insulin segment to drive domestic growth.
We expect the top 10 therapeutic segments to grow at 12 per cent, in line with market growth, and contribute around 35 per cent of domestic revenues," the report claimed.

Direct selling industry clocks slow growth this year: IDSADirect selling industry clocks slow growth this year: IDSA
BS Reporter | Ahmedabad Dec 03, 2014 08:57 PM IST
The direct selling industry in India touched Rs 7472 crore in revenues in 2013-14, up marginally from Rs 7164 crore in the previous year.
Indian Direct Selling Association (IDSA) in association with PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PHDCCI) unveiled Annual Survey Report 2013-14 on the Indian Direct Selling Industry.
"Direct Selling Industry reached Rs 7472 crores in 2013-14 from Rs 7164 crores in 2012-13 and Rs 6,385 crore in 2011-12. Due to regulatory bottlenecks, the sector has marked a significant decline in its overall growth this year' informed  Chavi Hemanth, secretary general, IDSA.
The total sales revenue by firms during 2013-14 can be split up in to total sales revenue of Rs 7,024 crore by the companies belonging to organised sector and Rs 448 crore by the unorganised sector.
Ajay Khanna, chairman, IDSA informed that as per the survey, Bengaluru was ranked the most attractive market followed by Delhi, Ludhiana, Mumbai and Jaipur in 2013-14.
The northern region registered a growth of 12.2 per cent in 2013-14 as against 33 per cent in 2012-13. The northern region contributed around Rs 2,170 crores to the gross sales revenue in 2013-14.
In contrast, the Eastern region has contributed around Rs 1345 crore to the gross sales revenue in 2013-14. 
The eastern region has scripted marginal increase in share to gross sales revenue at 18 per cent in 2013-14 from 17 per cent in 2012-13 and has registered growth rate of 10.4 per cent in 2013-14 as against 19 per cent in 2012-13. The North East has contributed around Rs 897 crore in 2013-14. 
"The North Eastern region has also scripted a marginal increase in share to gross sales revenue at 12 per cent in 2013-14 from 11 per cent in 2012-13. The region has exhibited a decline in the growth scenario at 13.8 per cent in 2013-14 from 27 per cent in 2012-13," IDSA stated.

Power game : Akhilesh Yadav meets Piyush Goyal'Power game': Akhilesh Yadav meets Piyush Goyal
Virendra Singh Rawat | Lucknow Dec 03, 2014 09:37 PM IST
Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday met Union Minister of State for Power and Coal Piyush Goyal in New Delhi and sought Rs 15,000 crore from the Centre for various energy projects in the state.
The meeting also discussed generation, transmission and distribution challenges facing the beleaguered power sector in the state. On November 8, a similar meeting between Yadav and Goyal was called off after the latter had cancelled his Lucknow visit.
The proposed meeting was touted as a positive development juxtaposed to bitter exchange of words between the Centre and Uttar Pradesh through statements and letters blaming each other for the state power crisis.
Meanwhile, the CM apprised Goyal UP was working towards separate feeders for agriculture and sought Rs 7,000 crore under Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana.
Besides, Yadav sought Rs 2,000 crore for installation of power meters in rural areas. For extension of urban power distribution network under integrated power development scheme, he sought an additional Rs 6,000 crore.
He said UP was making efforts to tide over power crisis and to ensure that by October 2016, the urban and rural areas got 22-24 hrs and 16 hrs power supply.
Yadav requested to ensure adequate coal supply for ensuring thermal power plants to work at optimum capacity. He alleged coal as per linkages was not being provided to Anpara, Obra, Harduaganj, Parichha and Panki thermal plants and thus generation was suffering.
He suggested coal should be stocked in advance at plants before monsoon so that supply was not affected. Stressing on providing power supply as per allocation made from central pool, the CM claimed this was not being done. He requested to enhance power supply to UP from Dadri power plant from 10 to 40 percent as the unit was located in UP.
Besides, Yadav urged the state be allocated new coal blocks against the cancelled coal block of Chandipada, so that adequate coal could be supplied to Harduaganj 1x660 mw, Panki 1x660 mw, Meja 2x660 mw, Stage-II Jawaharpur 2x660 mw and Obra-C 2x660 mw power generation units.
He pointed out due to non-approval of coal linkages for MoU based power generation plants, UP was facing serious challenges. As a result, the developer companies were also not able to honour their financial liabilities and projects were getting inordinately delayed.
The non availability of coal linkage was also hurting investor sentiments and adversely affecting the state's economy, he lamented.

Haryana govt to create integrated logistics hubHaryana govt to create integrated logistics hub
BS Reporter | Chandigarh Dec 03, 2014 09:10 PM IST
The Haryana government has decided to develop an Integrated Multi-Modal Logistic Hub (IMLH) as part of the prestigious Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) project.
It will be developed in over 1,200 acres, adjoining the Delhi-Mumbai freight corridor, near Industrial Model Township (IMT) at Bawal. Besides, it was also decided to expand the IMT over an area of 2,400 acres. The proposed projects are aimed to give a major boost to the state's prosperity and accelarate growth in southern Haryana.
The Haryana Infrastructure Development Board (HIDB), which met under the chairmanship of Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, on Wednesday approved the projects. For the purpose of funding the land acquisition, the HIDB took a decision for equity investment, amounting to Rs 900 crore.
It was said in the meeting the IMLH would be developed in public-private partnership (PPP) mode in collaboration with the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor Development Corporation (DMICDC) and is likely to be operational in the next two-three years. The project is envisaged to develop export-import (EXIM) container yard, domestic container yard, warehousing, auto zone and commercial zone. According to the initial project feasibility, the EXIM traffic is likely to constitute 75 per cent of the total container traffic estimated at 1.39 tonne equivalent units (TEU) by the year 2030.
In the meeting, the board also decided to extend a short-term loan of Rs 850 crore to HSIIDC to enable it to fund the acquisition of adjoining industrial area for extension of IMT Bawal. The short-term loan shall be paid back along with an interest of 8.9 per cent a year.
A special purpose vehicle (SPV) for implementation of the IMLH project will be formed to work out the modalities of financial structuring, terms and conditions involving equity investment and short-term loan for this project. The chief secretary would finalise the modalities for the same.
The DMIC project in Haryana would cover 66 per cent area of the state across 14 districts. Under the DMIC project, four investment regions - Manesar Bawal Investment Region, Faridabad Palwal Industrial Area, Kundli Sonipat Investment Region and Rewari-Hisar Industrial Area - would be developed. Under the first phase, Manesar Bawal Investment Region will be developed.
It was also said in the meeting the Manesar Bawal Investment Region (MBIR) would generate industrial output of $42 billion by 2040, which would likely to contribute 25 per cent of the state's gross domestic product. Besides, the project is expected to provide direct and indirect employment to 1.6 million lives by 2040.

As always, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent Palantala (Tripura) rally saw a huge turnout of people. However, just after the floral welcome of dignitaries on the dais and even before Modi began his address, many people from the public enclosure got up to leave. It was not clear whether these people thought the event was over or they simply lost interest, but it was only when security personnel urged them to remain seated and Modi started waving at them that they took their seats once again. In fact, Modi kept waving at the crowd through the one-hour event, and didn't relent even during the visiting Bangladesh minister's address.

A certain bureaucrat seemed extremely happy with falling prices of international crude. With oil prices plummeting by the day, it will be India that will have the last laugh, he pointed out. India can not only buy oil cheap, he said, it can now dictate the terms as well what with countries like Saudi Arabia wooing the country to buy larger quantities of oil from it, as the US and Europe gravitate to shale gas in pursuit of a cleaner, cheaper and more sustainable energy mix.

Safe  but is it soundLetters: Safe, but is it sound?
Business Standard | New Delhi Dec 03, 2014 09:03 PM IST
Apropos the editorial "Playing it safe" (December 3), on the eve of every monetary policy review statement by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the markets become agog with speculation about the possible changes in policy rate. But this time there was more speculation because of, among other things, the tacit indication by the finance minister that the economy, poised for higher growth, needs a monetary prod by way of a rate cut. If the policy rate is supposed to be an authentic signal to help economic agents anchor inflation expectations, then it needs to be realistic. Therefore, RBI has taken a prudent course to ensure that the signals of apparent mitigation of all supply side constraints would be sustainable in the short term to avoid any possible policy flip-flop.
In a bank-dominated financial system, a change in the policy rate will not have any significant bearing on the lending rate if the signal is not quickly taken into reckoning and factored in the deposit/lending rate fixation mechanism in place in banks - which, going by anecdotal evidence, does not happen quickly, more particularly when a rate cut is effected. A change in policy rate has no direct bearing on the balance sheets of the banks.

Up to 7 No Production Days a Month Till March: Mahindra
Kolkata: In one of the fattest pay package offered to an IITian ever in campus placements, a student of IIT Kharagpur has been offered an annual salary of over Rs 1.5 crore.
IIT Kharagpur officials said the salary package was among the 163 offers made by 27 visiting companies yesterday on the first day of campus placements.
The highest domestic package was of Rs 42 lakh and highest offer from abroad was of $250,000 (Rs 1.54 crore), the officials said.
IIT authorities have refused to disclose details about the student or the company which made the offer, saying "this brings unnecessary attention to the student."
IIT sources claimed that the 1.54 crore offer is the highest ever package received by the Kharagpur unit and among the largest ever in all IITs.
The highest number of offers (24) was made by niche analytics consulting company EXL Service Pvt Ltd followed by international brands like Visa, Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, Cisco, Microsoft IDC.
The first time visitors - Parthenon, TSMC, BMGI, VISA, Baker Hughes, and Auctus Advisors - offered large number of positions to IIT Kharagpur students.
The total offers received so far stands at 251, which includes 88 pre-placement offers.

Twitter rolls out new anti-harassment toolsBy Hayley Tsukayama December 2 Follow @htsuka
Twitter is taking some new steps to stop online harassment.  (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)
Twitter is rolling out the first of several changes to its service to combat online harassment, the company announced Tuesday.
The social network has simplified the way that users can report abusive behavior online and has enabled observers to report coordinated harassment attacks against an individual user. Overall, the changes give users more options to describe the kinds of harassment they're seeing online -- name-calling, violent threats, etc. -- and have been designed to look more like the rest of the site to make the process feel more intuitive.
Starting today we're rolling out an improved way to flag abusive Tweets. See how it works. https://t.co/Yf6cStz0z1
— Twitter Support (@Support) December 2, 2014
Twitter  has also introduced a "blocked accounts" page to let users see which followers they've decided not to interact with in the past. The page  makes it easier not only to unblock someone if your tiff with them has subsided, but also can provide a reference point for reporting abuse. Previously, users had no way of referring back to the accounts they'd blocked. If a user blocked someone in the heat of the moment and then wanted to report abuse later, he or she had to remember the harasser's username -- not always an easy task, particularly if one was the target of a coordinated abuse campaign.
The page will continue to evolve over time, the company said in an official blog post.
In fact, this the first batch of many changes that Twitter will be making to give users more control over the safety of their own accounts said Del Harvey, Twitter's head of trust and safety. "This is not us saying, 'Well, we've done these things, so nothing bad will happen on the Internet now.' And this not us trying to sprain our arms while trying to pat ourselves on the back," Harvey said. "We want to say to people that we are working to improve on this stuff."
Twitter has been criticized heavily in the past for the prevalence of abuse on its free-flowing social network. The firm added a "report abuse" button to its network shortly after British journalist and activist Caroline Criado-Perez faced a flood abuse over her campaign to get author Jane Austen on the 10-pound note. Since then, there's been concern over the harassment of women on Twitter -- such as Zelda Williams , the daughter of late comedian Robin Williams, and several people on both sides of the "Gamergate" controversy that rocked the video game industry over the summer.
But in considering how to stop such harassment on the network, Twitter has come up against its own hardline stance on protecting freedom of expression as it tries to navigate the definition of what qualifies as harassment and what doesn't. Harvey said the company has been working for years on how to balance the thing that makes Twitter tick -- the ability to say whatever you want to the world -- with the very serious issues of stopping abuse to ensure that the network is a safe place for its users.
"We must make sure it's not so easy to engage in abuse, but also not cross the line to make it so that you can't post any content," she said.  She said that Twitter will look for ways to "de-incentivize bad behavior" on the site by studying user behavior with the aim of better identifying trolls and discouraging them from engaging in harassment -- though she didn't specify how that might work.
It is highly unlikely that Twitter will ever implement suggestions from some anti-harassment advocates, such as blocking the IP addresses of  Twitter users who spout regular abuse. Free speech advocates have noted that method is a bit imprecise and could lead to accidentally blocking whole companies or even libraries from being able to use the social network. Instead, Harvey said that Twitter is working to provide more tools for individual users to customize their safety settings.
"I think one of the biggest components of our philosophy around that is we want users to have control over their experience," she said. "The whole idea of having a blocked accounts page means you can go back and make changes if you want to. You have control as the user." Those sorts of tools are what Twitter users can expect to see more of, she said, as the network continues its fight against online abuse.

Legal recognition of hallmarked jewellery  precious metals in the offingLegal recognition of hallmarked jewellery, precious metals in the offing

Standards should make it easier for consumers to assess product quality
New Delhi, December 2:  
The Bureau of Indian Standards Act (BIS Act, 1986) will enable hallmarking of precious metals and jewellery, including gold, by providing ‘legal recognition’ through amending the Act. On making the process mandatory, the Government will only take a call after further assessment of consumer needs by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs.
The BIS, which will now be positioned as the National Standards Body of India, currently certifies gold quality of as low as nine carat (K). Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan doubted that jewellers were disclosing quality grades to consumers.
“Till today, I had only heard of 18K to 24K gold. But I was told here that grades are as low as 9K. We need consumers to easily understand what is being sold and such distinctions are not clear when someone visits a shop to buy gold,” he said at a meeting today of stakeholders on the amendment of the BIS Act.
“By amending the Act, legal status is being given to gold hallmarking. It will remain a voluntary standard,” he added.
G Gurucharan, Additional Secretary, Department of Consumer Affairs, said there were two related concepts in setting standards for gold jewellery.
“One, there are tests for the purity and the other is the hallmark that guarantees quality assurance. BIS identifies hallmarking centres and gives recognition. All jewellery that is sold then is guaranteed as to the quality. We will work out the issue of making it mandatory after further consultation,” he said.
Hallmarking of gold jewellery, which assures customers of its purity, was introduced in 2000; jewellers are required to get licences from the BIS and get goods hallmarked by one of 300 BIS-authorised centres. According to the standards authority, there are almost 13,000 licensed domestic jewellers. The sellers can be penalised through a fine or have their licences revoked if they are found misusing the license.
Global branding
“We’ve been talking about ‘Make in India’ and standards should be good enough for it to become a brand globally. There are three issues — standards on which there should be no compromise, procedures that should be simplified and ease of understanding for consumers,” said Paswan, adding that the amendments, which include expanding the number of products covered for mandatory standards from 102 to 2,300, would be brought before the Cabinet at the earliest.

Mallya’s exit brings fizz to UB stocks; troubles mount further
PTI
Vijay Mallya
Mumbai, Dec 2:  
In an irony of sorts, self-proclaimed ‘King of Good Times’ Vijay Mallya today saw shares of his various group companies soar higher even as fresh troubles surfaced in form of the group’s holding entity being slapped with yet another ‘wilful defaulter’ tag.
This came a day after Mallya having to quit top posts at two group companies — Mangalore Chemicals & Fertilisers Ltd (MCFL) and long-grounded Kingfisher Airlines.
While most analysts have long stopped covering UB stocks due to continuing troubles at various group companies and lack of liquidity, they were also taken by surprise to see a sudden spike of up to 20 per cent in their share prices today.
Some of them said investors might be seeing the developments as a beginning of the endgame for Mallya, who no more has controlling stakes in United Spirits and United Breweries Ltd and his exit from MCFL and Kingfisher could leave UB Holdings Ltd (UBHL) as the only major entity where he may still have a significant role.
A few other analysts, however, said that the spike in UB group stocks could be like a ‘dead cat bounce’, which speculators might use to exit from their long-held positions.
The latest round of problems began last week with the minority shareholders of United Spirits Ltd (USL) trouncing proposed financial dealings of the company with its erstwhile promoter Mallya, who remains its Chairman as of now.
USL’s controlling shareholder Diageo is mulling over ways to take forward the matter after an unprecedented activism on part of investors to reject a proposal involving business transactions between existing and erstwhile promoters.
In another unprecedented setback, Mallya’s re-appointment as Managing Director of Kingfisher Airlines has been annulled by the government, while he had to quit on his own from the board of MCFL yesterday.
The problems are expected to grow further as several banks, including state-run SBI, are believed to have written to the boards of various UB group firms that no further loans would be provided to them in the wake of defaults made by Mallya and his group companies.
A senior banker said the loans availed by almost all UB companies indicated a complex web of transactions, where one entity was guarantor for the other and the second one took loans on the basis of guarantees given by yet another entity from the group or from among the promoters.
Notwithstanding the mounting troubles for the group, its holding company UBHL saw its share price surge by 19.80 per cent to close at Rs 23.90 on the BSE.
McDowell Holdings also rose by 19.93 per cent to Rs 34.30, while United Breweries climbed 8.11 per cent to Rs 825.65. United Spirits Ltd gained 7.14 per cent to Rs 2,913.
Shares of Pioneer Distilleries were also up 5 per cent.
Trading in shares of two companies — Kingfisher and UB Engineering — got suspended yesterday due to their non-compliance to listing agreement norms.

Sun-Ranbaxy gets FIPB okay but competition panel nod still eludes
Our Bureau
CCI’s decision likely by December 5
New Delhi, December 2:  
The Sun Pharmaceuticals-Ranbaxy deal has got the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) nod, but the Competition Commission of India is yet to give its view on the merger.
This mega pharma agreement is the first merger deal to face public scrutiny in India.
On Monday, Sun Pharma informed the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) that it has got FIPB approval for issuing equity shares of the company to the non-resident investors of Ranbaxy Laboratories.
However, the $4-billion deal is still awaiting a nod from the CCI, which was expected to decide on the matter by the end of November.
Reportedly, the CCI has asked both the companies — Ranbaxy and Sun Pharma — to divest some brands which, when merged, would create a monopoly in the market. The CCI is expected to announce its decision on the matter by December 5.
While CCI Chairman Ashok Chawla could not be reached through calls and messages, Ranbaxy refused to comment on the matter.
According to the terms inked between Ranbaxy and Sun Pharmaceuticals in April, each Ranbaxy shareholder will get 0.8 shares of Sun Pharmaceuticals for every share of Ranbaxy.
The deal, merging Daiichi Sankyo-owned Ranbaxy Labs with Sun Pharma, is likely to create the fifth-largest pharmaceutical company in the world and the largest in India.
In September, the CCI had called for public comments on the deal and said in a statement, “The Commission formed a prima facie opinion that the combination is likely to have an appreciable adverse effect on competition.”

Industry rues status quo approach
Special Correspondent
economy (general)
Industry, on Tuesday, expressed displeasure over the status quo approach adopted by the Reserve Bank of India in its monetary policy.
“While the policy was on expected lines, a rate cut would have been favourable. We, as a country, are shooting for higher growth rates and since policy rate actions work with a lag, the RBI could have helped spur higher growth expectations, especially given the other data points on inflation, slow growth and investment,” said Mahindra & Mahindra Chief Financial Officer V. S. Parthasarathy.“The auto industry is still looking for strong revival of demand and lower interest rates would have helped the cause,” Mr. Parthasarathy added.
The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham) said the RBI obviously overlooked strong demand from industry for a cut in interest rates. “Industry’s demand for lower interest rates was fully justified,” it said.
“The concerns over inflation have largely been addressed with crude oil prices dropping by the day. Secondly, growth remains muted with second quarter numbers at 5.3 per cent staying lower than the first quarter. Certainly, if we need to really go in for the ‘Make in India’ initiative in the right earnest, the growth must be given priority, Assocham President Rana Kapoor said.
Confederation of Indian Industry President Ajay S Shriram, said even a symbolic cut in policy rates at this juncture would have sent a strong signal down the line that the government and the RBI acting in concert to harness demand and take the economy to the higher orbit of growth.
“Industry was particularly hopeful of a rate cut considering that China has surprised the market by reducing interest rates by 40 basis points to attract investments. A rate cut would have propelled investment demand, spurred spending and given a fillip to construction activity,” Mr. Shriram said.

LIC union appeals against FDI hike in insurance
Yuthika Bhargava
foreign investment
“Private companies have gained notoriety for malpractices”
As the government prepares to introduce amendments to the Insurance Act, the All-India LIC Employees Federation (AILEF) has appealed to the Members of Parliament not to raise the foreign direct investment limit in the sector beyond the current 26 per cent.
“We appeal to the honourable members of Parliament not to make indecent haste in thinking of raising FDI to 49 per cent without in-depth examination of the entire issue,” AILEF said.
The federation believes the move will encourage privatisation in the sector, which may be detrimental to the interest of the consumers.
It said claims were turned down on a large scale in the private sector. “While LIC paid 97.73 per cent death claims in 2012-13 (taking the figure to over 99 per cent in 2013-14), repudiating only 1.12 per cent claims, the private companies repudiated 7.85 per cent claims in 2012-13 and showed 3.47 per cent ‘outstanding’,” the appeal stated.
“It is necessary to examine how and for what reasons the claims have been repudiated as, generally speaking, the private companies have gained notoriety for malpractices.”
The appeal pointed out that dissatisfied with the penetration level in the life insurance industry, particularly in the rural sector and among weaker sections, the Malhotra Committee had in 1994 recommended the entry of private companies and allowing up to 26 per cent FDI.
However, the move had not resulted in increased penetration. In fact, there was a continuous decline in penetration level.

Ethio Express takes the wait out of Ethiopian cuisineBy Tim Carman December 2 Follow @timcarman
The fast-casual market has already swallowed up Mexican burritos, American hamburgers, seasonal salads , Italian pizzas, Vietnamese sandwiches , and it's still hungry for more. Enter Ethiopian natives Yisak Fiseha and Selam Gebreyes, who have fresh meat to feed the beast: their breezy new take on Ethiopian cuisine.
The husband-and-wife team opened Ethio Express Grill on Nov. 18 at 952 Sligo Ave. in Silver Spring, just a door or two down from Jackie's . The couple left the software industry to try their hand in the hospitality business, hoping to find a niche in the rapidly growing fast-casual market .
Ethio Express: Is it the first to push Ethiopian cuisine into the fast-casual market? (Tim Carman/The Washington Post)
"We were looking at the Ethiopian food business," Fiseha explained over the phone. "We thought it can be presented in a better way than it is being presented now."
Fiseha laid out his multi-point plan to make Ethiopian cuisine "more mainstream" and "more accessible": Ethio Express, he says, is conceived to prepare meals fresher, cheaper, faster and healthier than the standard peddler of Ethiopian platters.
The "fresher" part boils down to a decision the owners made to focus on, as the best fast-casual concepts do, only one or two dishes. In Ethio Express's case, it deals in grilled tibs. You can select your protein (beef, chicken, lamb or tofu), your base (injera, pita, spaghetti, brown rice or mixed greens) and your sauce (Ethio hot, Ethio mild, yogurt honey, among others).
Ethio Express wants to deliver a fresher, healthier take on Ethiopian food. (Tim Carman/The Washington Post)
Unlike the Ethiopian stews known as wats, tibs can be prepared fresh to order on the grill. "You cannot make a stew quickly," Fiseha said. "You have to make it and store it in the refrigerator. . . If you store it, it's not fresh anymore."
The "healthier" component is simple. Ethio Express prepares its tibs not with spiced Ethiopian butter (called niter kibbeh) but with a blended olive and canola oil. "It's good for health," Fiseha promised.
As for "cheaper" and "faster," Ethio Express will prepare you a meal for around $10 and hand it to you in less time than it takes the average Ethiopian shop to trot out a platter of injera covered with wats, tibs, salads and whatnot. As you might suspect, the owners worked with a fast-casual consultant in conceptualizing their 40-seat restaurant, which probably explains its clean lines and its penchant for over-explaining the cuisine (see graphic on how to eat Ethiopian food with injera).
For newbies to the cuisine, Ethio Express offers a step-by-step chart on how to eat Ethiopian food. (Tim Carman/The Washington Post)
As you also might suspect, Ethio Express is ripe for expansion. But Fiseha quickly batted down those expectations — for now.
"That's some time down the road," he said. "We don't want to grow too fast because you have to make it work. We have to market it. We have to make people love it. We have to fine tune it. You know, make it enjoyable."
"I don't think expansion is going to be a big problem," he added, "if we have something that people like."

Doormen: Sometimes, you don't even get a thank you, let alone a tip.
Doormen say they do not make “unbelievable yearly incomes” and deserve a minimum-wage increase
Doormen at several luxury hotels in downtown Chicago scoffed at the notion they don't deserve a raise because they take in "unbelievable yearly incomes," the result of large tips.
That's what Marc Gordon, chief executive of the Illinois Hotel and Lodging Association, said Monday as he explained why tipped workers, such as doormen, shouldn't benefit from an increase in Chicago's minimum wage rate. He said some are paid $4.95 per hour, a rate that will increase a dollar an hour in 2016. Afterward, the rate would be indexed for inflation.

"Some of these people are making unbelievable yearly incomes," Gordon said. "It's hard to tell, but it's all tips."
"It's a pretty good job," said John, who has been working as a doorman for 30 years hailing cabs, carrying bags and opening doors for guests. During that time John said he's always been paid minimum wage plus tips.

John, who like other doormen declined to give their last names for fear of losing their jobs, said he got into the industry in California. While trained in radiology, John began working as a doorman in college and continued in that job after moving to Chicago 26 years ago.
His total annual income, John said, never amounted to an "unbelievable income."
How much does he make? John grinned and said he couldn't discuss it. Just then a guest walked out of the building. John flashed a smile and asked if the guest wanted a taxi. The man nodded and John, dressed in a long gray coat and a black hunter hat, blew his whistle.
"Are you interviewing him?" the man asked a reporter.
Upon learning the interview was about the minimum wage, the man showed part of a neatly folded bill and said jokingly that John wasn't making minimum wage anymore.
As the cab approached, John grabbed the guest's bag.
"Did you have a nice visit?" John asked.
"I did," he responded. Then he got in the cab and shook John's hand.
John put his hand on his pocket and walked back a few steps to greet another guest.
A block south, a doorman who said his name was Eric stood on the sidewalk, seemingly bored.

With a new $13 minimum wage, will higher paychecks help or hurt Chicago businesses?
Chicago on Tuesday joined the growing ranks of major cities that have raised their minimum wage, a move decried by business groups as a jobs killer but touted by labor groups and other supporters as a way to lift Chicago workers and their families out of poverty.
The City Council overwhelmingly approved gradually raising Chicago's minimum wage to $13 an hour from $8.25 by mid-2019, with the first incremental hike to $10 coming in July. Meanwhile, state legislative leaders pulled the plug on a proposal to raise the statewide pay floor to $11 until January at the earliest.
Chicago's vote comes as concerns escalate about widening income inequality, and as cities and states across the country enact laws to boost the earnings of their lowest-paid workers.
Doormen at several luxury hotels in downtown Chicago scoffed at the notion they don't deserve a raise because they take in "unbelievable yearly incomes," the result of large tips. ( Alejandra Cancino )
In November, voters in Oakland, Calif., approved a referendum to push the minimum wage to $12.25 per hour from $9, and to $15 per hour from $10.74 in San Francisco, while voters in Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota approved measures that would raise the pay floors in those states to as much as $9.75 per hour.
"We look in our city, and we see the growing chasm between those who have and those who don't," said Ald. Will Burns, 4th, who led the Chicago council's charge to boost the minimum wage. "Raising the minimum wage is not the solution to all of these problems, but it is a key step toward bringing greater equality, bringing greater justice and bringing greater democracy to our city."
8
Business groups have vehemently opposed the city ordinance in favor of a state plan that would offer a more level playing field, warning that Chicago's hike would drive many of their members out of the city and force others to fire employees or close their doors. The minimum wage, they said, has a domino effect. If the lowest-paid employees get a raise, the rest of the workforce would also expect a raise, putting additional pressure on small businesses.
"Make no mistake, this will cost thousands of low wage jobs throughout Illinois as businesses flee," said a joint statement from the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce, the Illinois Restaurant Association, the Illinois Retail Merchants Association and the Illinois Hotel and Lodging Association.
"Further, it puts at severe risk the small businesses in border communities throughout Chicago that neighbor the suburbs and Indiana," the statement continued. "Such an increase will permanently depress new business development and hiring."
Theresa Mintle, chief executive of the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce, said the City Council vote was "disappointing." The focus now turns to Springfield, she said, where the chamber wants more time to put together a package with pro-business reforms.
Hank Meyer, owner of BJ's Market and Bakery, which has two locations on the South Side, is worried.
He expects that he will have to raise prices on his Southern-style menu items by 20 to 25 percent to cover the higher wages, which could put them out of reach for many of his customers. That wouldn't just hurt his business, he said, but also the neighborhoods, which don't have many restaurant options beyond fast food.
"I operate in a community where there are few discretionary dollars," Meyer said. "My customers are very price sensitive. I don't want to be a place relegated to special occasions."
Meyer, who opened the first BJ's at East 87th Street and South Stony Island Avenue in 1996 and the second at 79th Street and Racine Avenue in 2005, said that he employs about 45 people, and that 37 of them make minimum wage or just above. He may have to cut jobs if customers balk at shelling out $12 for a Southern-fried catfish rather than $9.99.

@mlljj63 Not to worry...those employees who experience an increased work load due to manpower cutbacks will almost certainly become disgruntled, organize into a union, and demand ever higher wages for all of the hard work that they're doing. It's a vicious cycle.

Meyer, who supports a statewide increase, said a hike only in Chicago may do more harm than good to the people it purports to help. If job candidates flock to the city from neighboring suburbs to compete for high-wage entry-level jobs, they might edge out locals with less experience, he said.
Meyer also worries that vendor costs might increase as they adjust their prices to the new wage, piling on expenses when his business model is fragile to begin with.
"This isn't about sound economic policy," Meyer said, "this is about the election cycle."
Labor groups celebrated the new law.
"I started crying," said Katelyn Johnson, executive director of Action Now, a member of the Raise Chicago coalition, which lobbied for the increase. "This means so much for so many people."
Johnson said Chicago's ordinance is "a victory, but it's just the first step." Up next, she said, is getting Illinois lawmakers to increase the state's minimum wage.
Last month, two-thirds of Illinois voters supported raising the state's minimum wage to $10 per hour in a nonbinding referendum.
Johnson said the minimum wage is a personal issue for her because her mother worked two jobs, often at minimum wage, to support the family.
"The fight is not over," Johnson said, adding that labor and community groups will continue to push for a $15 minimum wage. Fast-food workers demanding $15 per hour wages are planning dozens of protests across the country on Thursday, including at multiple restaurants in Chicago.
Douglas Hunter, 53, a fast-food worker who is planing to join the protests, said the city's minimum wage increase "is something to look forward to." He received word about the vote from a union organizer via text message and ran inside the McDonald's where he works to share the news. His co-workers clapped, he said.
Hunter, who makes $9.25 per hour as a maintenance worker at McDonald's, said he recently had to borrow money from his sister to pay his $775 rent. He was short nearly $200 because he's been scheduled to work 30-hour weeks.
"I'm struggling," he said.
McDonald's said in a statement, in part, that the company and its independent franchisees "support paying our valued employees fair wages aligned with a competitive marketplace and that are compliant with local and federal laws. We believe that any minimum wage increase should be implemented over time so that the impact on owners of small and medium-sized businesses — like the ones who own and operate the majority of our restaurants — is manageable."
The Oak Brook-based company added that 90 percent of its U.S. restaurants are independently owned and the company does not set wages for its 3,000 franchises.
Grant DePorter, president of Harry Caray's Restaurant Group, said it is too early to tell how the wage hike will affect his business, but he said the increase comes as businesses like his are dealing with higher health care costs.
Charlene Brandt, regional manager of government affairs for 7-Eleven, said the City Council vote was "not surprising," but she wants to know what the city plans to do to help small businesses cover the increase. Ninety-eight percent of the 7-Eleven locations in Chicago are owned by franchisees, she said, and they already are at a competitive disadvantage because Indiana has lower taxes on items such as cigarettes.
"How are they going to control their labor costs? Chances are they're going to cut hours, and they're going to end up covering shifts more," Brandt said of the franchisees.
But some shop owners applaud Chicago's new law.
Jennifer Pope, owner of Red Balloon children's boutiques, said she supports the increase to $13 because most hourly workers, she believes, are not teens angling for extra spending cash but adults supporting families.
"It's predominantly grown-ups and predominantly women, and a lot of them are mothers," Pope said. "This would be something that would stabilize families here and now, which would ultimately cost us less."

Dhoni reaches Adelaide without usual fanfareWritten by Bharat Sundaresan |
Posted: December 3, 2014 2:01 am | Updated: December 5, 2014 12:51 pm
For all the incessant fanfare that surrounds him, MS Dhoni has always tried to remain inconspicuous. At times, desperately so, despite being the most coveted yet scrutinized cricketer in the world. But he’s failed. Almost always.
On Friday, however, he might just get away with it. For once, Dhoni may actually manage to slip into a city almost unnoticed, or at least with not many making much of a fuss about his arrival. Australia will have somehow begun finding its collective nerve back after having bid adieu to Phillip Hughes. In fact, even Virat Kohli & Co will be at the Glenelg Oval in the middle of their practice match when their skipper lands in Adelaide. But like they do every time he walks out to bat, the Indian team will breathe a lot easier once Dhoni, their singular leader, takes over the reins.
Having said that, it’s unlikely that he will recover in time from his finger injury to captain the visitors in the first Test next week, which should mean Kohli will indeed lead the side at the Adelaide Oval. But the fact that Dhoni is making the journey Down Under prematurely is indicative of his keenness to get acclimatised in time for the second Test in Brisbane.
In that case the tour selection committee, which will include the captain himself, could well be left facing a puzzling quandary on who to leave out of the second Test. Does Dhoni come in to take his natural place behind the stumps reducing Wriddhiman Saha’s participation in the series to a solitary Test? Or will the team management take a gamble with playing the skipper as a pure batsman and leaving the wicketkeeping duties to Saha?
For starters, that decision might also have a lot to do with how much the diminutive Bengal gloveman makes of what will incidentally be his second Test in Adelaide, and his first anywhere since the last time he played here. And it is likely that Saha is a cynosure of sorts when the Indians take on a yet-to-be-named outfit on Thursday and Friday at Glenelg. Well, along with the top-order and the fast bowlers.
Falling behind
For the record, Saha had hung around manfully to guide Kohli to his maiden Test ton in the Australian summer of 2011-12. But he comes into the mix after Dhoni, who amassed 349 runs in England, had batted more assertively and scored more runs than ever before during a tour outside the subcontinent. India will certainly hope that their top-order doesn’t fold as haplessly as they did against James Anderson & Co. But Saha at No.7 will have to double up both in front and behind the stumps to continued…

Jack Ma unleashes e-commerce power in XinjiangUpdated: December 4, 2014 10:18 IST
Jack Ma unleashes Alibaba on Xinjiang

Alibaba Group Executive Chairman Jack Ma speaks in front of a giant screen showing real-time sales figures of e-commerce giant Alibaba, on the "Singles' Day" online shopping festival at the Alibaba headquarters in Hangzhou in east China's Zhejiang province.
TOPICS
company information
China’s internet icon Jack Ma is unleashing the power of e-commerce in Xinjiang — a move that could help counter extremism in the restive border region.
The Alibaba group, Mr. Ma’s brainchild, is now geared up to tap the economic potential of Xinjiang and other neighbouring areas to develop e-commerce, cloud computing and big data.
“From here, we see an opportunity, an opportunity to sell produce from Xinjiang to the entire country and the world,” said Mr. Ma, recently at the Xinjiang E-commerce forum. He added: “Cross-border trade will be our next priority.”
By focusing on China’s less developed western region, Mr. Ma is riding on the New Silk Road initiative of President Xi Jinping, which hopes to develop an “economic belt” along a land route that, eventually, will connect Asia with Europe. The Chinese have set aside a $40 billion dollar seed fund to develop state-of-the-art infrastructure along this route, including high-speed rail links, roads, energy pipelines, fibre-optic highways and industrial parks.
Gu Jinbiang, public relations director of the Alibaba told China Daily that the group has taken into account the development of the Silk Road Economic belt, to further its plans.
Mr. Gu stressed that Xinjiang and the province of Gansu, which also falls along the Silk Road, are rich in farm and pasture products, but have limited market access. Consequently, Alibaba is sending a team
that hopes to connect local businesses with the online portal.
The Alibaba group has thrived on linking small businesses in remote areas to the national and global markets, after the former patriarch Deng Xiaoping’s reforms generated localised growth in areas, which lacked wider market access. Speaking in New Delhi last week, Mr. Ma asserted that over the next three years “one of the key strategies for Alibaba is to globalise and to make sure that we can help more small businesses around the globe, use our services to do businesses.”
Alibaba’s Xinjiang initiative is exceptional as the region has been wracked by violence driven by a vicious separatist movement. Last Friday, 15 people, including 11 attackers were killed, when they targeted a street full of food stalls with explosives and knives.
Around 3,000 ex-servicemen are being recruited to protect residential communities in Urumqi, Xinjiang’s capital, the newspaper, Global Times, affiliated with the Communist Party of China is reporting.
Xinjiang is central to the development of the New Silk Road, which starts from Xian, in Shaanxi province, which is also on Mr. Ma’s radar screen. Mr. Gu, of Alibaba, acknowledged that the group “is also discussing with authorities in Shaanxi province, and hopes to reach an agreement soon.” From Xian, the former imperial capital and home to the famed Terracotta warriors, the Silk Road heads towards Urumqi, and then through Central Asia, Iran, Iraq, and Turkey’s Anatolia, it ends up in Venice. Venice is also the point of termination of another parallel Chinese initiative-the 21st century Maritime Silk Road, which passes through the Malacca Straits, before entering the Indian Ocean and then makes it way to Europe via the Suez Canal.

Sharma had invited the three Khans, among other celebrities, to be part of the celebrations, and interestingly, when the trio shared the stage, it was called Khan Ki Adalat. They even danced to Salman's famous towel-dance with Sharma. 
Heaping praises on the show, Salman said that he was impressed with the spirit and enthusiasm of Sharma's team in sustaining the show for 21 years. When asked who from the industry would he want to be grilled in the show, the Dabangg star said: “Katghare me mujhse better koi khada nahi ho sakta.”
Filmmaker Madhur Bhandarkar, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, actor-turned-politician Shatrughan Sinha, actors Ajay Devgn, Sonakshi Sinha, Anupam Kher, Kirron Kher and several other big names also marked their attendance at the celebration. The episode will be aired on December 7, on India TV.
Twiter went abuzz with fans of the Khans going crazy at the event. Sample a few tweets:

Pratibha Industries tumbles on ratings downgradePratibha Industries tumbles on ratings downgrade
Bhavana Acharya
Tweet
December 3, 2014:  
The stock of construction company Pratibha Industries lost 9.8 per cent in trade today, and is still down by 4.7 per cent. The stock tumbled as rating agency Crisil downgraded the company’s long-term debt by one notch to BB+ (from BBB), and short-term debt to A4+ from A3+, both with a negative outlook.
The short-term rating indicates minimal degree of safety with respect to timely servicing of financial obligations and holds very high credit risk, susceptible to default. The longer term debt is slightly better, indicating moderate degree of risk in defaulting on timely debt servicing.
Soaring interest outgo
The company’s interest payments have been skyrocketing from the March 2013 quarter, when they jumped 70 per cent. Its consolidated debt to equity ratio rose from 1.6 times in the 2012 fiscal to 2.9 times in the 2014 fiscal. Interest costs accounted for 11 per cent of sales in the first half of this fiscal.
Pratibha has not faced an order book drought, unlike several peers. The company’s focus on water supply, tunnelling, and other urban infrastructure - segments which have not seen the degree of sluggishness that swamped projects in airports or roads – helped it keep up the order stream.
But delays in execution of the projects took a toll on revenues. For 2013-14, consolidated revenues grew just 5.8 per cent, down from the 29.6 per cent growth in 2012-13. The slower execution also led to longer working capital cycles. Inventories and trade receivables have surged in the past two years.
Pratibha has been working on monetising some of its assets to pay off debt. It is selling off its manufacturing SAW pipe division, land on which factories were set up and other commercial properties. Pratibha also has its debt rated by Brickwork Ratings, which, in October this year, reaffirmed long-term debt at BWR A- and short term debt at BWR A2+.

Minister for Communications and Information Technology Ravi Shankar Prasad on Wednesday said India and Japan could leverage each other’s prowess in technology to jointly work in areas like green technologies, cyber security and ICT (information and communication technologies) development.
Speaking at the second meeting of the India-Japan joint working group on ICT, Mr. Prasad said the Indian government had launched a massive programme to digitalise administrative functioning with the sole objective of improving efficiency and delivery of services.
“India has taken a big leap forward in letting technology play a pivotal role in brining about the much needed change in governance in India. With friends like Japan, there is a natural scope to help us in achieving this objective,” he added.
This is the second meeting of the group, which was formed in October 2013 to boost bilateral trade in the field of ICT.
Mr. Prasad is leading the Indian delegation, while Yasuo Sakamoto, Vice Minister for Policy Coordination, International Affairs, is heading the Japan team.
Mr. Prasad said the programme will benefit greatly with the help of a tested ally like Japan, which has established supremacy in ICT. It is also expected to help in increasing trade manifold between both the countries, which is currently about one per cent.
The group is also exploring cooperation in national ID application and utilisation project.

It also seeks to make illegal mining a cognizable offence with provisions for enabling States to set up Special Courts to try such offenders.
Attracting private investment and eliminating delays are among the main objectives of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Bill, which the Narendra Modi Government is keen take up in the winter session of Parliament.
Under this, illegal mining is proposed to be declared as a cognizable offence with provisions for enabling State governments to set up Special Courts to try such offenders.
“We are keen to get the momentum back in the mines sector. Please give us your critical feedback on the Bill,” Anup Pujari the Union Mines Secretary, said at the inaugural session of the Global Mining Summit on Wednesday.
He said that the government was trying to unbundle the sector and do away with regulatory permits for certain notified minerals. The bill prescribes competitive bidding by auction as the method to be followed for allocation of Mining Leases for notified minerals. Reconnaissance Permits or Prospecting Licences is proposed to be done away with for these minerals.
The minerals which are proposed to be notified would include iron ore, limestone, manganese and bauxite. The Amendment Bill seeks to differentiate between bulk surface minerals and deep-seated, difficult-to-access minerals. Bulk minerals account for 85 per cent or more of the value of mineral production in India. These will be subject to different procedures.
Importantly, the Amendment seeks to empower the Centre to pass orders in cases where a State Government fails to pass orders within time limits prescribed. While the Centre now has powers to pass revision orders, this provision became necessary as experience showed that in many cases authorities entrusted with powers under the existing Act do not pass orders within set time limits.
It may be mentioned that the previous government at the Centre had also planned to introduce an amended MMDR in 2011 to repeal the 1957 Act. However, it could not pass the legislation and it had lapsed.

Minimum built-up area reduced to 20,000 sq meters
New Delhi, December 3:  
The Government has formally notified a reduction in the minimum area and minimum capitalisation requirement for foreign investors in construction to attract more funds into the cash-starved sector.
Foreign investors can exit projects on its completion or on development of trunk infrastructure such as water supply, drainage, roads and street lighting, according to a Press Note released by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) on Wednesday.
The Press Note is based on the decision taken by the Cabinet for FDI in construction development in October this year.
The minimum built-up area requirement for FDI in construction projects has been reduced to 20,000 square meters from 50,000 sq.m.
For services plots, the minimum area requirement, earlier at 10 hectares, has been dropped completely.
Minimum capital requirement has also been halved to $5 million from $10 million.
For encouraging investments in affordable homes, the Centre has exempted the conditions of minimum floor area as well as capital requirement if an investee/joint venture company commits at least 30 per cent of the total project cost for low-cost housing.

Have separatists been rejected in Kashmir polls They are only  half a Machil  awayKashmir rejects separatists? They are only 'half a Machil' away

Kashmir has come a long way electorally from the time terror organisations openly displayed television sets and coffins outside polling booths. Then, the message in no unclear terms was: whoever dares to vote can take the television as a prize but end up in the coffin.

Fear outside polling stations was palpable all through the nineties and in the current election underway in the state, the headlines are emerging from the high voter turnout. Seldom have Kashmiris lined up in long queues but is the high turnout-- 71% in the first two phases --really a rejection of the separatists as we are being told? Are the Kashmiris really saying they want 'azadi' from the Hurriyat hardliners who would rather have the electorate boycott the poll?
It would be foolish to read the mood in such banal and simplistic ways. The Kashmiris draw a clear distinction between an election and the larger political resolution of a dispute that has them firmly centered in the crosshairs. They vote for daily needs--bijli, sadak paani--as do you and I in UP, MP, Delhi or Karnataka. "We have a right just like you do. Why should the government not provide us basic amenities," is the popular refrain. They vote also because government schemes are designed around legislators and constituency funds and Kashmiris feel they have the right to demand better schools and medical care.
If voter turnout were to be an indicator of the ground situation in the state, the 2008 election ought to have settled it. The queues outside polling stations were fairly long then too. Take one example: in Handwara, from where separatist leader-turned-regular politician Sajjad Ghani Lone is contesting, the turnout has stayed in the 70 percent bracket over two elections: 71 percent in 2014 and 75 percent in 2008.
If percentages were an indicator, the Valley would not have gone through one of its most turbulent phases in the summer of 2010, two years after a successful election in 2008. And let's not forget that the 2010 agitation--which started soon after the fake encounter in Machil --was being steered by the separatists. Hadn't we written off the separatists after the 2008 election too?
For most of us sitting in Delhi, the separatists are 'anti-nationals', more so after the Narendra Modi government called off talks with Pakistan because the neighbour's high commissioner held meetings with the Hurriyat leaders.
If the government at the Centre is indeed serious about resolving the Kashmir issue, it must first understand the difference between aspiration and alienation. Yes, the Kashmiris aspire for a better future through jobs, through better education facilities and through better healthcare but an election does not bring the alienated community any closer to the power centre in New Delhi.
Too many promises have been made by too many prime ministers. Atal Bihari Vajpayee promised everything within the circle of humanity (insaniyat). PV Narasimha and Deve Gowda too, while speaking of autonomy for Jammu and Kashmir, had said, "the sky is the limit." More recently, after the 2010 agitation rocked the state, home minister P Chidamabaram set up a three member committee whose report was submitted but never acted on.
If there is any azadi the Kashmiris want, it is from oppression: the oppression and high-handedness of the army and the paramilitary forces through whom the Center makes its presence felt.
If Machil happened when the UPA was in power, Kashmir has already seen the killing of two young schoolboys in Budgam under the new Modi dispensation. Yes, in a first, the government was quick to regret the killings of the boys travelling in a Maruti car but that is only one small step towards alienated Kashmir.
It would be real pity if the Center sat back after the conclusion of the elections with the view that the democratic process is the final cure. Too many governments have made the same mistake. The elections, in fact, are a window of opportunity. Gone are the days when the Kashmiris considered it an honour to shelter gun-wielding terrorists.
If the Kashmiris have rejected anything--it is gun and the cycle of violence that spared hardly a home in the Valley. The governments led by Omar Abdullah in the state and Manmohan Singh at the Center, both failed the Kashmiris when they met stone pelters with bullets.
A smart government will be one that reaches out in innovative ways. Else, the separatists are there. It will take half a 'Machil' for them to gain center-stage.

India is considering reworking the subsidy-sharing formula for Oil and Natural Gas Corp  ,Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Wednesday, in a bid to lower its discount burden and boost the state-run oil company's profits.
Pradhan did not give details in a written statement while responding to a lawmaker's query.
The country's largest oil and gas explorer, nearly 69 percent owned by the government, has seen profits decline due to the sale of crude oil to state-run refiners at discounted rates.
India does not regulate prices of petrol and diesel any longer, but state-owned companies are forced to discount prices of other common fuels such as kerosene and cooking gas to keep a lid on retail prices.
Any move to lessen its discount burden will be favoured by investors as the government plans to sell a 5 percent stake, worth about USD 2.5 billion, in ONGC as part of its divestment programme.
Shares in ONGC ended 3 percent higher at 371.45 rupees, while the broader Nifty rose 0.15 percent.

Louisiana spent more on tax credits for Green Lantern than it did on the University of New OrleansBy Hunter Schwarz December 3 Follow @hunterschwarz

The amount of money Louisiana offers in tax incentives for film and television is more than six times as large as it was a decade ago, according to Louisiana Department of Economic Development data.
In 2013, $251 million was spent on incentives, compared with $40 million in 2003. Incentives have increased for three consecutive years, and the state has been a shooting location for films like “Green Lantern,” “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” “Twilight,” and television shows like “American Horror Story” and “Salem.” According to the Advocate , Louisiana spent more on incentives for “Green Lantern” than it’s spending at the University of New Orleans this year.
“The only way the movie tax credit program works is you have to keep paying them that incentive every year,” Travis Scott, president of Public Affairs Research Council, told the Advocate . “I think one of the movie promoters gave the best argument against this program when he said, ‘If you change or eliminate this program, we’ll all go to Georgia tomorrow.’ That, to me, speaks volumes.”
In 2013, Gov. Bobby Jindal’s (R) proposed tax plan was criticized by film industry leaders who said it would “cripple” the industry. Jindal eventually did not push for the cuts.
But a handful of states have begun reconsidering their film incentive programs, including North Carolina , where the state legislature allowed their program to expire. In Maryland , a state study recommended the legislature allow their incentive program to expire, while Nevada lowered the amount it offers annually.

Obama would rather not bother IranYou knew this was coming :
National security advisor Susan Rice.  (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)
Placing additional sanctions on Iran would “blow up” negotiations over the country’s nuclear program, national security adviser Susan Rice said Tuesday.
“The P5+1 would fracture, the international community would blame the United States rather than Iran for the collapse of the negotiations, and the Iranians would conclude that there’s little point in pursuing this process at the negotiating table,” Rice said at a conference hosted by The Wall Street Journal.
This comes from the national security adviser who has presided over an unprecedented series of debacles and whose credibility with Republicans is nonexistent. Simply put, very few people not employed by the administration, the Iranian regime or Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) (who once again is the odd man out in the GOP and the Senate at large in opposing new sanctions) believe her warning.
It is worth noting that at the same annual meeting of the Wall Street Journal CEO Council,  Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) , who preceded Rice , made clear sanctions are needed. He later told the Washington Examiner : “We’re happy to work with the administration if they are willing to consider a calibrated sanctions bill, but if the answer is no to anything except these negotiations that have gone on for a year without much progress, then that’s a non-starter for me.”
Former deputy national security adviser Elliott Abrams tells me, “Susan Rice is falling into the trap Iran has set for her and her boss: valuing the negotiations and a possible agreement more than the actual goal of stopping the Iranian nuclear weapons program. She has become a press agent for the so-called ‘moderates’ she believes lead the Iranian government.”
Her protestation that we cannot do anything to rattle the Iranians means we have accepted the long, quiet slide toward containment. Certainly, we no longer have a credible military threat and now the administration seems poised to block new sanctions that could recover some leverage with the mullahs. What does she propose to do? Sit there and talk for another 18 months, presumably.
The comments, hardly unexpected, contradict the administration’s repeated statements over years of fruitless negotiations. The Senate Republican Policy Committee in a brief memo recalled that the president repeatedly promised a return to sanctions if Iran did not agree to an acceptable deal: “This latest extension of sanctions relief for Iran violates the president’s promises to the American people. First, he said the sanctions relief provided to Iran would be ‘limited’ and ‘temporary.’ With the extension, that relief appears to have become limitless and permanent. Second, in announcing this framework last year, President Obama  said  that if Iran did not seize the opportunity given to it, Iran would ‘face growing pressure.’ He reiterated this position in the State of the Union address last January.” Alas, we know by now that Obama’s threats are empty and his bottom line is invisible.
The memo continues:
President Obama admitted as recently as November 5 that the sanctions regime brought Iran to the negotiating table over its nuclear program. Increased sanctions will only make a favorable final agreement more likely. Sanctions relief has certainly failed to produce one.
Now is the time for President Obama to implement his own stated policy: that he would be the first to call for more sanctions if Iran rejected the diplomatic overtures offered it. He should call on Congress to send him a bill imposing increased sanctions on Iran before departing for the year, and Congress should deliver it. Barring that, it should be an early order of business for the next Congress in January.
President Obama has taken enough time trying to talk Iran out of its illicit nuclear program. After six years, it is clear that Iran has no interest in seizing the opportunity given to it.
But Obama has no interest in drawing any lines with Iran. And Iran runs amok. “Meanwhile, Iran’s program progresses, Iran has troops in Iraq and Syria, and Iran supports terrorism,” says Abrams. “Obama policy has been an enabler for Iran, but [Rice] clings to the notion that negotiating with front men is the solution. She ought to get tough on Iran instead of threatening Congress.”
Rice and her boss appear willing to keep talking until Obama leaves office and this becomes someone else’s problem. Fortunately, a large bipartisan majority is poised to challenge him, pass new sanctions and remind him of the terms of an acceptable deal. He may veto it, but the Iranians will know that the president in essence has no support for the type of concessions he reportedly has been offering.
Now, who is Hillary Clinton with — Susan Rice, Rand Paul and the new Obama or Congress (and the old Obama)? I suspect she’d rather not say.

NASA has a spaceship and now needs a destinationBy Joel Achenbach December 3 Follow @joelachenbach

Nothing demonstrates the extreme inertia of space technology more vividly than the Orion space capsule, which NASA has been working on since 2006 and which, as my colleague Chris Davenport reports , will finally have its first test flight Thursday morning if all goes as planned.
The capsule has cost something like $9 billion so far and will cost billions more before it is ever flown with people inside. Orion will be launched this time atop a Delta IV Heavy rocket, one of the jumbo rockets owned by United Launch Alliance (a Boeing-Lockheed partnership that has a virtual monopoly on national security and military launches). This will be a quick flight, lasting just 4½ hours, with a couple of spins around the Earth and a top altitude of 3,600 miles before the capsule splashes down into the Pacific Ocean.
Then, in 2018, Orion will have its first test flight atop NASA’s new SLS heavy-lift rocket, which is still being built. The key detail about these first two test flights is that no one will be aboard. Finally, circa 2021 or 2022, Orion will have its maiden flight with human beings inside.
You don’t need an advanced degree from MIT to grasp that this is a very stately, deliberate program, one free of the sin of haste and the vice of urgency.
Has there ever been a piece of human space hardware developed so slowly?
Or so expensively?
Serious question: Is it not a fact that Orion is the costliest capsule in human history?
Yes, it has lots of bells and whistles that the Apollo capsules lacked. This one has XM/Sirius radio built in, butt-warmers in the seats, four-way adjustable mirrors and Big-Gulp-sized cup-holders. It’s got a guest room, a fully stocked bar, a laundry room and 24-hour concierge service. It’s a really nice spaceship !
NASA will launch its newest spacecraft, Orion, into space for the first time Thursday, on a flight that will take it farther than any spacecraft built to carry humans has gone in more than 40 years. (NASA)
The great mystery is where it will go. If you have a big rocket (like the SLS) and this new capsule, where should you go?
This question was at the core of The Washington Post’s big NASA project last year, which we called “Destination Unknown.” The Houston Chronicle has a similar whither-NASA series this year, entitled “Adrift.”
Thursday’s flight, according to NASA, will help “put Mars within the reach of astronauts in the 2030s,” according to Davenport’s story. Here is NASA’s slightly scary-looking Journey to Mars graphic that shows Orion as a component.
The problem is, there is no such thing as a NASA Mars mission right now. That’s an aspiration that currently lacks funding. In space, budget is mission-critical.
Orion could, in theory, be used for such a mission, but it’s a single piece of what would be a complex array of technologies and hardware. Yes, a journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step, but only if you keep walking, and are seriously committed to the journey — no pretending or arm-waving allowed.
(I drive to the store and buy an onion. I drive home and cut it up and put it in a big pot on the stove and then go watch television. Someone asks me, “What are you doing?” and I answer, “I’m making gumbo.” And the someone says, “What about the garlic, the peppers, the celery, the fresh okra, the andouille sausage, the grilled chicken, the fish, the shrimp, those special blended peppers you always use, and the roux, not to mention the fresh French bread on the side?” I answer, “I can’t afford that right now.”)
Orion was designed to take astronauts to the moon as part of the Bush Administration’s Constellation program. Obama killed the program but, along with Congress, let key elements of it survive, namely Orion and the heavy-lift rocket. Space hardware is highly customized, so the kind of heat shield you’d want for a trip back from the moon, and into Earth’s atmosphere, is different than one you’d want if you’re returning from Mars. So if Orion were used in a Mars mission it would probably need a heat shield upgrade (I’m told by smart friends who understand the engineering). No problem, but are you sure you want a four-seat capsule for your Mars mission? Maybe you’d want something different by the time you drew up the blueprints for the journey — a smaller, Honda Civic-sized thing rather than this Ford F750. In space, hardware tends to be extremely customized and is designed for specific missions. NASA doesn’t use a lot of off-the-shelf material; it rarely says, “We got this cool spaceship; let’s take it for a spin and see what we bump into.”
As we reported last year in our series, NASA wants to go to Mars but can’t afford it, and cooked up a fallback plan involving a trip to an asteroid. But it can’t afford that, either, since, for reasons of orbital dynamics and delta-V, visiting an asteroid in its natural orbit around the sun would require a mission lasting on the order of 300 days and a full roundtrip around the sun before the crew returned to Earth. So the fallback to the fallback is the Asteroid Redirect Mission, which would involve a robotic spacecraft that would capture a small asteroid and tug it to lunar orbit. The astronauts would then blast off in the Orion, atop the SLS, and rendezvous with the rock and do spacewalks and inspect it and bring back samples.
That is the NASA plan.
Orion’s test flight is part of that narrative. I hope, and expect, that it will go swimmingly, because NASA engineers are great at what they do and invest years of their lives in developing these spaceships. It should make for an interesting morning. But where this is going, ultimately, will remain something of a mystery.

Expect more from your hot water heaterBy Matt McFarland December 3 Follow @mattmcfarland
If you want your home to be more energy efficient, start here. (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)
Smart is the new black. Whether you’re talking about a smartphone, a Nest thermostat or the Aros air conditioner, there’s a race to add intelligence and “smarts” to the devices and things we use.
Goodbye dumb devices, hello smart gadgets that are aware of their surroundings, connected to the Internet and able to serve us better.
Sunnovations , a Northern Virginia company, wants to bring smarts and intelligence to hot water heaters. It’s hard to think of an appliance that’s less sexy than a water heater. They’re dull looking and hidden in basements and closets. So why get excited about upgrading your water heater? Just look at this chart:
(2011 Department of Energy data)
After heating your home, the second largest expense is heating water. The traditional hot water heater will keep about 50 gallons of water warm, 24-7. It doesn’t matter if you’re about to shower, are at work or have left on vacation.
“The reality is we don’t need 50 gallons of hot water all the time,” said Sunnovations chief executive Matt Carlson.
Sunnovations has launched a Kickstarter campaign to complete development and begin manufacturing the Aquanta, a device that can be installed on most existing water heaters. Carlson says the Aquanta will cut the energy a hot water heater uses by 10 to 30 percent.
“We felt like this is a way for us to bring an appliance that has really been left out of the smart home,” Carlson said. “There’s a bazillion smart thermostats and a billion smart fridges and who knows what, but no one has addressed the plumbing network in your home and specifically the water heater.”
The Aquanta will be monitored on your smartphone. (Sunnovations)
While major manufacturers currently sell some hot water heaters that aren’t as dumb as previous models, the average consumer isn’t likely to pay hundreds of dollars to replace their functioning hot water heater. That’s the audience Sunnovations is targeting. The device is expected to retail for $150.
For handy homeowners, Carlson says installing the Aquanta should be simple, but others will need to hire a handyman. The Aquanta relies on a enthalpy sensor that’s inserted in the tank. Energy is saved as the Aquanta learns your usage patterns and turns off the tank during periods when you’re not likely to need hot water. Because the Aquanta connects to WiFi, a homeowner on vacation could remotely turn off their water heater to save energy.
Carlson also envisions neighbors and friends being able to compare their usage, which would add a gamification element .

The score of every basketball  football and baseball game in league history  visualizedBy Philip Bump December 3 Follow @pbump
In this Nov. 24, 2014, file photo, Philadelphia 76ers' Tony Wroten reacts to a call during the second half of an NBA basketball game against the Portland Trail Blazers in Philadelphia. The winless Philadelphia 76ers are the worst team in the NBA and on another lengthy losing streak for the second straight season. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum)
The Philadelphia 76ers are an extremely bad basketball team, even outpacing how bad the Oakland Raiders are at football. The Sixers are 0-and-17. The Raiders, 1-and-11. Hundreds of millions of dollars in salaries, and you get one win in 28 tries between them.
There's an easy explanation for why that is that is more complex than it sounds: neither team is scoring enough points. Yeah, no kidding. But to find out just how bad they and other poor performing teams are doing, we  pulled data on the most common scores in the NBA and the NFL (and, for kicks, the MLB), and -- surprise! -- both teams are scoring dramatically below the average. (This year, the Sixers scored 91.5 points on average versus their opponents' 105.9; the Raiders scored 14.7 points versus opponents' 28.1.)
Let's start with the NBA, looking at the most common scores (winning or losing):
The most common score in NBA games (looking from January through the postseason) is 102 points, winning or losing. That's all-time; since 2000, the most common score was 99 points. In the 1950s, the most common score was 83 points. You can see how scores from the 1950s are shifted further to the left than the curve on the whole. The next decade, scores spiked, eventually settling back down.
The Sixers are averaging 91.5 points per game this season, and have scored more than 99 points only four times. Their opponents are averaging 105.9 points, and have scored more than 99 points in 12 of 17 games. The average acts as a dividing line.
Likewise the NFL. The graph of the most common scores in the NFL are much more jagged, for the simple reason that NFL scoring takes place in 1-, 2-, 3-, and 6-point increments.
The most common score, though, has been much more consistent. Since the 1960s, the most common winning or losing score in each decade has been 17 points, two touchdowns and a field goal. The Raiders have averaged 14.7 points per game. Their opponents have averaged 28.1. The team has beaten the average only three times -- their opponents have beaten it in every game but two.
And, for no reason other than completeness, here's the graph for Major League Baseball. With 162 games per season, there are a lot more games being considered. And the graph is much, much neater.
Each sport follows a rough bell curve, disrupted in the case of the NFL by the weirdness of trying to score, say, 11 points in a game. Teams that regularly fall on the left side of that curve do poorly. Teams that land on the right side do well.
Our advice to the Sixers and Raiders is simple: Try to score more points than average. Hope that helps.

The Switchboard: Twitter is making it easier to block harassment(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)
Published every weekday, the Switchboard is your morning helping of hand-picked stories from the Switch team.
Twitter rolls out new anti-harassment tools . "The social network has simplified the way that users can report abusive behavior online and has enabled observers to report coordinated harassment attacks against an individual user," reports Hayley Tsukayama for the Switch. "Overall, the changes give users more options to describe the kinds of harassment they're seeing online -- name-calling, violent threats, etc. -- and have been designed to look more like the rest of the site to make the process feel more intuitive."
The FTC just scored a victory in its suit against Amazon.   "A federal judge won't dismiss the Federal Trade Commission's lawsuit against Amazon over the company's practice of billing parents for in-app purchases their children made without parental approval," reports the Switch's Brian Fung. (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos also owns The Washington Post.) "The lawsuit alleges that Amazon failed to stop children from spending millions of dollars of their parents' money for virtual items in online games and other apps on devices such as Amazon's Kindle Fire tablet."
Sen. Al Franken Questions Lyft On Its Privacy Practices . "Sen. Franken’s questions come in 10 parts, and hit on predictable points: which employees can access customer data; how training is structured for employees that can access that information; what 'mechanisms' exist to provide oversight of worker activity; and how third-party corporations interact with user data," Alex Wilhelm at TechCrunch reports. The Senator previously questioned fellow ride-hailing company Uber about its privacy practices.
Can political groups raise money for the mere idea of a woman president?  "ActBlue, the Democratic online fundraising powerhouse group, is asking federal election officials whether it can set up a system for allowing fundraising on behalf of a female presidential candidate before knowing who, exactly, the money would go to," reports the Switch's Nancy Scola.
Obama’s pick to lead the Pentagon is big on cybersecurity  President Obama's reported pick to lead the Pentagon, former deputy secretary of defense Ashton "Ash" Carter,  is has been a big advocate for expanding the U.S.'s cybersecurity capacity, the Switch reports. "His nomination signals that the administration is likely to continue to aggressively build out its ability to fight adversaries in the digital world."

Centre to divest 5% stake in steelmaker SAIL on Friday
Reuters
Tweet
December 3, 2014:  
The Indian government will sell a 5 percent stake in state-run Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) on Friday, kicking off a disinvestment program that is crucial for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government to help cut the budget deficit.
The government, which has 80 percent stake in SAIL, plans to sell up to 206.5 million shares through an auction on the stock exchanges, according to a regulatory filing on Wednesday.
The sale, worth $286 million at the stock's Wednesday close, would mark the first stake sale under the new government, which won a landslide election in May largely on a promise of economic growth.
India, which has targeted to raise about $9.5 billion through share sales by March, is counting on a 5 percent stake sale in Oil and Natural Gas Corp and a 10 percent stake sale in Coal India for the bulk of the proceeds.

India s rapeseed output seen falling  Indonesia to gainIndia's rapeseed output seen falling, Indonesia to gain
Reuters | New Delhi Dec 03, 2014 08:10 PM IST
The world's biggest palm oil producers, Indonesia and Malaysia, are set to benefit from an imminent fall in rapeseed output in India, a top industry body said on Wednesday.
"An incremental rise in overseas purchases due to a fall in local rapeseed oil output would be bridged by rise in palm oil imports," B.V. Mehta, executive director of the Solvent Extractors' Association, told Reuters.
India imports palm oils mainly from Indonesia and Malaysia.
In 2013-14, its palm oil imports fell for the first time in four years.
Traders forecast India's rapeseed output could fall a tenth in 2014-15 as farmers sowed the main winter oilseed crop on a smaller area than the previous season because of poor soil moisture in the main growing areas.
That could lead to higher imports of edible oils to India, the world's leading buyer, in the current marketing year that began in November and might support benchmark Malaysian palm oil futures, which have dropped by a fifth this year.
Traders expect rapeseed output to drop to 7.0 million tonnes in the 2014-15 crop year (July-June) from 7.4 million last year.
The planted area is forecast to drop by 6 percent to 6.7 million hectares (16.6 million acres) from 7.1 million hectares.
Rapeseed oil supplies could fall by 11 percent to 2.4 million tonnes in 2014-15 from the previous year, when ample monsoon rain helped the oilseed crop.
"Rapeseed output will depend on how the temperature prevails in the next six to seven weeks," said Govindbhai G. Patel, managing partner of G G Patel & Nikhil Research Co.
Rapeseed needs damp condition for sowing and this year's poor monsoon in the northwest, including the main growing state of Rajasthan, led to the fall in planted area.
Sandeep Bajoria, chief executive of the Mumbai-based Sunvin Group, said local rapeseed oil supplies could be fall by 300,000 tonnes in 2014-15.
India's edible oil imports rose for the third year in a row to 11.6 million tonnes, estimated at $10 billion, in the year to October due to a surge in soy and sunflower oils. But palm oil, the main contributor to the edible oil import basket, fell for the first time in four years.
India meets 60 percent of its 18-19 million tonnes of annual edible oil demand through imports.

India s platinum demand to rise 25% in 2015India's platinum demand to rise 25% in 2015
Dilip Kumar Jha | Mumbai Dec 03, 2014 10:32 PM IST
Platinum demand in India is likely to rise 25 per cent in 2014 on the back of growing consumers’ interest in bridal jewellery and other innovative collections. In its latest quarterly analysis, London-based World Platinum Investment Council (WPIC) has pegged India’s platinum demand at 125,000 ounce (oz) in 2015, compared with 100,000 oz in 2014.
“There has been a growing focus on emission norms in India. With this, there is a great upside in platinum use as a catalyst in diesel cars going forward. We estimate India’s platinum demand from automotive sector to rise to 165,000 oz in 2014,” said Paul Wilson, CEO, WPIC.
Platinum demand is steadily rising in India with the introduction of innovative designs of jewellery and wedding sets. The Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) estimates India’s platinum import during April-October 2014 at $11.99 million against $6.81 million imported in the year-ago period. WPIC in its analysis reported a 50 per cent decline in above-the-ground stocks to 2.56 million oz in 2014 from 4.14 million oz in 2012. Also, the global platinum market is expected to remain in a deficit with 885,000 oz for 2014 - 27 per cent more than the shortfall of 695,000 oz in 2013.
Meanwhile, reduced supply owing to unprecedented closure of South African mines is likely to keep platinum prices up next year. Data compiled by Kitco.com showed average platinum price at $1,208.85 an oz in November, a sharp decline from $1,259.78 in October and $1,362.36 an oz in September. In August, however, average platinum price was hovering at $1,492.65 an oz.
“One of our key objectives is to introduce greater transparency to the market. Today’s report shows the fundamentals of the industry have become tighter. Demand has exceeded supply in each of the last three years. As a result, above-ground stocks have declined significantly. The markedly different profile in the 2014 third quarter analysis highlights the value of more frequent scrutiny of actual performance, and reflects seasonality as well as some investment outflows,” said Wilson.
Total global supply of platinum is expected to be 7.1 million oz in 2014, nine per cent lower than the previous year owing to disruption on unprecedented South African mining strike. Total global annual supply from mining is expected to be 13 per cent below 2013 levels by year-end 2014, largely attributable to the five-month mining strike in South Africa. Global platinum supply from recycling in 2014 is estimated to be two per cent higher, or 40,000 oz more than in 2013.
Global platinum demand is expected to be six per cent lower this year at eight million oz, as a decline in investment demand offsets growth in automotive and jewellery demand. The two largest sources of demand are both forecast to grow in 2014. In 2014, demand from the automotive industry is expected to expand by five per cent or 145,000 oz, as platinum is already benefiting from Euro VI-compliant vehicles being manufactured.
Global jewellery demand in 2014 is expected to continue to grow, with an additional 115,000 oz of demand forecast - an increase of four per cent. Overall purchasing in China remains robust and platinum continues to make important inroads into the newer, Indian market.
CORRECTION
Earlier version had said India's platinum demand likely to rise 25 per cent in 2015 which is 2014 indeed.

BSE seeks clarification from FTIL on MCX-SX stake to 13 entitiesBSE seeks clarification from FTIL on MCX-SX stake to 13 entities
BS Reporter | Mumbai Dec 03, 2014 07:48 PM IST
BSE has sought clarification from Financial Technologies (FTIL) on the sale of warrants in the MCX-SX stake-sale to 13 entities, including ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, conducted last month. The exchange has raised questions over the viability of warrant sales after they had been treated as extinguished by the company earlier this year in August.
As per the MCX-SX stake-sale, FTIL had entered into a 'share and warrant purchase' agreement with the 13 entities in a deal amounting to Rs 88 crore. However, prior to that, the FTIL Board had decided to treat the warrants as being extinguished and to transfer an amount of Rs 56 crore as non-refundable interest free deposit against warrants to the capital reserves, in a notice posted on the website on August 25, 2014.
The BSE has now asked the company to explain the sale of these 'extinguished warrants' and on further updates on the transfer of the amount to the capital reserves.
FTIL did not immediately illicit a response.

Stocks climbed a bit Wednesday, with the Dow and S&P 500 notching all-time closing highs as economic reports showed steady growth on jobs and in other fronts.
The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 0.2% -- and therefore above its record close of the previous session. The S&P 500's 0.4% gain was enough to send that broader index past its previous record close set exactly one week ago.
After its gain of 33 points, the blue-chip Dow settled at its new high of 17,912.62. The S&P 500's new number to beat is 2074.33, an increase for the day of nearly 8 points.
Finishing 0.4% higher, the Nasdaq composite ended the day at 4774.47.
On Tuesday, the Dow hit a new all-time closing high of 17,879.55 – about 51 points above the prior record close set Friday.
Monthly Markets Checkup: 6 things for December
The private sector added 208,000 jobs in November , payroll processor ADP said Wednesday, as the labor market continued to defy mixed economic news.
Economists had estimated ADP would report 226,000 new private sector jobs, according to Action Economics' survey. They expect the Labor Department's closely watched survey on Friday to show 225,000 payroll gains by businesses, as well as federal, state and local governments.
Services firms expanded at a faster pace in November , a signal that overall economic growth should remain robust. The Institute for Supply Management says its services index rose to 59.3 last month, up from 57.1 in October.
Worker productivity increased in the July-September quarter at a slightly faster pace than previously estimated while labor costs declined for a second straight quarter. Productivity, the amount of output per hour of work, increased at an annual rate of 2.3% in the third quarter while labor costs fell at a rate of 1%, the Labor Department reported Wednesday.
European stocks ended mixed.
In Asia on Wednesday, Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.32% and Kong's Hang Seng index dropped 0.95%.
The Russian ruble has extended a week of decline, fueled by low oil prices and Western sanctions against Russia over its role in Ukraine's crisis.
The ruble traded 1.7% lower at 54.8 against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday morning, losing over 16% of its value in the past five trading days.

What's your retirement IQ? For most, it's lousy
Rodney Brooks , USA TODAY 3:47 p.m. EST December 3, 2014
Retirement literacy and planning is critical today more than ever because Americans are on their own when it comes to retirement.

In survey after survey, Americans have not scored well on retirement literacy tests. But a new survey of Americans ages 60 to 75 says 80% failed a retirement income literacy test.
The results of the poll, released today by the American College of Financial Services in Bryn Mawr, Pa., are pretty dismal. The poll was conducted through online interviews of 1,019 people  60 to 75 years old with at least $100,000 in household assets.
They were asked 38 retirement literacy questions on basics, such as Social Security, life expectancy, IRAs, life insurance and investments, and how bonds work. Only 2 in 10 had passing grades, the college said.
"We're not surprised by the fact that people don't know a lot about retirement income planning," says David Littell, program director at the American College. "I was surprised at how badly they did."
It's not the first survey to raise concerns about Americans' retirement readiness. The  2011 report "Financial Literacy and Retirement Planning in the United States," done for the National Bureau for Economic Research, found similar shortcomings, though not to the same degree. That report said, "Americans fail to understand critical financial concepts, including interest compounding, inflation, and risk diversification, and these shortcomings are most acute for women, the less educated, and older individuals." That report also said many people have failed to plan for retirement, even when it's only five to 10 years off.
Retirement literacy and planning is critical today more than ever because Americans are on their own when it comes to retirement. Company pension plans have largely been replaced by company-sponsored 401(k) plans and Individual Retirement Accounts.
5 things to do now if you're near retirement
"I'm not surprised that most Americans have low levels of retirement income literacy. And in many ways, can we blame them?" asks personal finance guru and author Lynnette Khalfani-Cox. "Those older people who do have good savings habits or positive money-management skills typically learned the value of thrift from their parents. But they're the exception, rather than the rule.
"Most Americans — of all ages — didn't have the best financial role models in their parents," she says. "Nor do we get any formal training or teaching in the area of investments, Social Security, long-term care and related topics. With so many complexities and so many options, it's very difficult for the average 60-year-old to stay on top of the stock market, to fully understand the variety of annuities offered in the marketplace, and to also navigate issues like life insurance, taxes and medical insurance planning."

00:05  The government announced the annual cost of living increase in
00:08  Social Security benefits. A whopping one point 7% hike or about
00:12  22 bucks a month for the average beneficiary. Hulu but there
00:16  are three other thing can he do about Social Security. I'm
00:19  John Wagoner and this is America's markets. First Social Security isn't
00:23  all that generous. The average Social Security pay out as 1294.
00:28  Dollars a month he's not going to be spending a lot
00:30  of time on the Love Boat on that. Second a lot
00:32  of people live off Social Security alone. For about 23% of
00:36  all Mary beneficiaries. Social Security represents 90% or more of their
00:40  income. Now outsourced to 46%. For single beneficiaries. Third it's valuable.
00:47  If you wanna replace Social Security in the private market you'd
00:49  be more than 300000. Additional retirement savings according vanguard. That's without
00:54  benefits to survivors or disability benefits which Social Security also provides.
00:59  Sure you might say people should pay their retirement out of
01:02  their own pockets but they go the average middle class workers
01:05  say just 20000 dollars towards retirement. Even with a really good
01:09  and that's returns that OK too far and what's your retirement
01:12  obvious defusing unexploded bombs. Social Security is designed to supplement your
01:16  retirement income to keep saving. And it can be fixed reasonably
01:20  easily at this point but for many people it's their most
01:23  valuable retirement asset.
Among the highlights of the new report:
•Only 1 in 4 have a written financial plan, even though a written plan leads to better financial planning and financial decisions.
•A significant minority have never tried to figure out how much they need to accumulate to retire securely.
•Only 31% know that $4,000 is the most they can afford to withdraw per year from a  $100,000 retirement account to make it last for 30 years.
•More than half underestimate the life expectancy of a 65-year-old man, which suggests they may not realize how long their assets must last.
•Only 54% realize that Social Security benefits increase each year one delays up to age 70, and a similar percentage know that it is best to wait until age 70 to claim Social Security if you expect to live to 90.
"I see many people who lack critical knowledge about financial products and investing in general," says New York attorney Ann-Margaret Carrozza, who specializes in elder law and estate planning. "This collective financial ignorance threatens to undermine the security of countless retirees.
Should you pay off your mortgage when retiring?
"Without a solid financial education, the average investor is at the mercy of his or her financial adviser," she says. "This leaves them more susceptible to being placed into inappropriate investments (with high commissions to the adviser) as well as outright fraud.  I encourage my clients to attend continuing education classes at their local colleges or high schools to shore up their financial knowledge.  This can help increase confidence and  reduce some of the stress surrounding retirement planning."
Financial planner Michael Dalton, a retired professor of accounting and taxation at Loyola University in New Orleans who has written or co-written more than 100 books on financial planning, says he thought the questions in the survey went well beyond the survey's subject, and some were were overly general. Questions on insurance and reverse mortgages should not be included in a retirement-income survey he says. And, he says, the questions went well beyond what people might know. But still, it addresses the problem of retirement literacy.
"There were too many questions about insurance and investments and not enough questions about retirement income," he says.  Still, he was positive about the survey. "I would say this is a good start," Dalton says.
Khalfani-Cox was still taken aback. "I was surprised by the fact that about 1 in 3 older Americans haven't even tried to figure out how much money they would need in retirement," she says. "Even if someone doesn't have a financial adviser, there are scores of calculators and online tools to help you at least ballpark your retirement needs.
"Given this reality, I wonder if many of these pre-retirees and retirees have simply given up doing any real analysis and planning and opted instead to either cross their fingers or stick their heads in the sand and hope for the best," she says. "Obviously, neither strategy will get them to a secure retirement."
She said there is more than enough blame to go around: "I certainly don't completely blame the 50+ crowd for their lack of financial knowledge," she says. "The survey's findings also speak to the poor job that many financial advisers must be doing with their clients. How can you claim to help someone plan for retirement if the client literally does not have a written plan? That's inexcusable!"

1:00 pm
Tiger Woods now has an Indian connection. In a major coup, Indian two-wheeler giant  Hero MotoCorp has signed the 14-time major winner as its brand ambassador.
Tiger Woods has signed a 4-year deal with the company for Rs 250 crore. Woods in fact had made a day's trip to India at the invitation of Hero MD Pawan Munjal earlier this year and played a round of golf at the Delhi Golf Club.
He said he was very shocked and surprised with the huge turnout at the Delhi Golf Club. He believes Indians just love sports with cricket being number one. “I think the country just loves sports and to have the ability to play there in Delhi and to have Munjal here and to have all the people that were there so excited about the sport was exciting to see,” he added.
Meanwhile, Munjal adds that it is too early to get Woods to play a tournament in India but surely during their partnership he (Woods) will come back and hopefully play one of the Hero Indian Opens too.
Hero Moto is also sponsoring the world challenge which will see 18 of the top 26 golfers in the world compete over the coming weekend. This deal is one of the biggest signed by an Indian company with an international celebrity and is in keeping with the company’s desire to be present in 50 countries by 2020.

After last week s big shopping push  there s still one more purchase worth considering: TravelDone shopping? Now's the time to book holiday travel
Kelli B. Grant CNBC
Email
After last week's big shopping push, there's still one more purchase worth  considering: Travel. Just be sure to factor in winter storms when booking.
Deals abound, whether you're looking to travel home for Christmas or are  planning ahead for an early 2015 getaway. Travel site Kayak found the first  week of December is the best time to book domestic holiday travel, with prices  about 5 percent cheaper than surrounding weeks. Late bookers could see prices  jump by 36 percent over current rates. "Every day you wait from here is going to  be more expensive," said Brian Kelly, founder of ThePointsGuy.com .

Holiday travelers wait for Amtrak trains, at Penn Station in New York, New York.
The timing coincides with the holiday shopping melee. Airlines, hotels and  booking sites weren't shy about promoting sales for Black Friday or Cyber  Monday—and many of those are still in effect, along with new batches of weekly  and seasonal offers. "The deals are good. They definitely are good," said George  Hobica, founder of deal sites AirfareWatchdog.com and HotelWatchdog.com .

For example, Fiji Airways has an $899 round-trip special between the island  nation and Los Angeles for early 2015 travel. "That's about $250 less, maybe  even $300, than normal," he said. For domestic fares, Southwest , Virgin America and JetBlue all have sales  this week for travel this month into next spring.
Even if you're not ready to book now, shoppers can take advantage of  airlines' online shopping malls, which often offer bonus deals this time of  year, said Kelly. For example, Macy's , Blue Nile and Kmart are all doubling  promotions to 4 miles per dollar spent through United's Mileage Plus  Shopping. At Delta's SkyMiles Shopping, Famous Footwear has doubled its rate to 8 miles per dollar.
Read More Shopping online  deals? You can do better
Although sale fares tend to sell out fast, take the time to compare offers  and scrutinize terms before you book. "Probably the biggest hiccup are the  blackout dates," said Gabe Saglie, senior editor for deal site Travelzoo . Holiday  travelers may need to book creatively to make the sale dates work. Other deals,  particularly packages, can have tough policies for cancellations and  changes—worth weighing in the face of winter storms. 
Video: Mark Orwoll of Travel & Leisure magazine says families can save money on holiday travel this year by changing the days they fly, choosing airlines that don’t have extra fees, and using social media to find deals and promotions.
Airlines typically waive change fees when bad weather hits, but that could  still leave travelers out money from their hotel, cruise or tour. Maybe even  without a vacation. "The reality is, if we have a limited window of opportunity  to travel to a destination, the fact that they're waiving fees may not help,"  Saglie said.
Read More On a holiday budget?  Beware these 11 retail traps
If cancellation policies are unforgiving and the trip is expensive, it can  help to consider travel insurance. Some credit cards, including a few from Chase and Citibank , even offer to  reimburse cardholders for nonrefundable portions of their trip stemming from a  delayed or canceled flight, said Hobica.
To limit the chance of problems, aim for flights leaving early in the  morning, which are less likely to be delayed or canceled. Nonstop is best, but  if you must book connecting flights, look for stopovers in warm-weather cities,  said Hobica. "Connect through Phoenix or Dallas rather than Chicago in winter,"  he said. "You're less likely to have a misconnect due to weather."

Higher numbers indicate greater search interest in the five terms, which all had a lot of search volume with reliable data.
The searches rise in the spring and fall, ebb during the summer months, and drop sharply during holidays. Christmas is the least miserable day of the year, with Christmas Eve and New Year’s Day not far behind (numbers for December of this year are projections based on last year's figures). A seemingly random Wednesday in late April may be the worst day of the year.
Peaks and valleys in the raw numbers -- the light blue line -- reflect the rhythm of the workweek. People are more miserable on weekdays, less so on weekends. Averaging out each day over the past year, Tuesday and Wednesday are tied for the most miserable day of the week, with Monday and Thursday not far behind.
Among the five search terms comprising the index, “depression” and “stress” show the most day-to-day variation. Pain and anxiety peak on Mondays, stress and depression on Tuesdays, and fatigue on Wednesday. Searches for all terms drop sharply going into the weekend and then edge back upward on Sunday.
On one hand, the daily ebb and flow is not surprising -- we like weekends a lot better than we like work days. On the other hand, these numbers suggest that people literally hurt more on Mondays, which is pretty astonishing.
It's also notable, looking at the top trend chart, that the gap between weekends and week days shrinks in the summer months: those peaks and valleys are a lot closer to each other in July than they are in March and April.
If we are what we Google, what do these trends tell us about ourselves? I posed this question to Dr. Elinore McCance-Katz, who is a psychiatrist and Chief Medical Officer at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration , which is an agency within HHS. Looking at the big annual picture, she said that seasonal blues probably plays some role here.
"It's been shown pretty clearly that as daylight decreases, starting in the fall, people will have more feelings of depression and anxiety. If they are feeling depression and anxiety they will report stress," she told me. This would explain the uptick in misery-related searches from late summer through fall.
But there's something else going on too.
If you look at the annual trend in searches for "seasonal affective disorder," for instance, you'll find that these peak about when you'd expect them too -- in December and January. But the broader terms like " depression ," " anxiety ," and " stress ," all show a pronounced dip in December, which is reflected in the Index chart above.
One explanation? Holiday-induced euphoria. At the daily level, Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, Christmas day, and New Year's day are all among the year's least-miserable days. We hear a lot about holiday-related stress , and the numbers certainly do show some high-misery days in November and December. While I wouldn't go so far as to say the holidays are the most wonderful time of the year, there's pretty good evidence here that they're the least-miserable.
But what's happening in the Spring months? This is more of a mystery: you'd expect people to get happier and less miserable as the days grow longer and temperatures get warmer. But according to these Google searches, misery peaks in March, and a random Wednesday in April appears to be the most miserable day of the year.
Dr. McCance-Katz points out that researchers have discovered greater incidence of depression and anxiety in the spring months, too. As it turns out, lengthening daylight may discombobulate people's chemical regulatory system. "There are these different neurotransmitters that have been implicated in mood disorders," she says. "It could be that people also have imbalances in serotonin, in melatonin, that are affected by day length and can also affect mood."
Mental health experts consistently find that suicides peak in the Spring , for reasons that aren't fully clear. The uptick in misery reflected in the Index above likely reflects some of the drivers of this phenomenon.
The good news, according to Dr. McCance-Katz, is that these feelings of malaise are easily treatable, and that if you experience them you're far from alone. SAMHSA's latest numbers  show that 43 million American adults -- nearly one-in-five -- experienced some form of mental illness in the past year. Many of these disorders are easy to treat with medication or therapy.
Some notes on the data
There are of course limitations to how much we can say about a society's mental state based solely on search figures. For instance, Google users are a non-representative subset, albeit a large one, of the broader population. Moreover, there are plenty of reasons why a person would search for, say, "depression" when they're not actually depressed themselves: depression searches spiked in late August this year around the death of Robin Williams.
On the other hand, it's completely reasonable to posit that these searches do reflect broader public health trends. Google data is used to track influenza outbreaks , for instance, although doing so is not without its  methodological pitfalls .
More to the point, the daily search volume for the five terms I used to create the index followed very regular patterns, which are reflected in the charts above. Aside from the burst in interest in depression in August mentioned above, there were no large unexpected spikes in the data that had to be accounted for -- this suggests that underlying social phenomena are driving these numbers.

Big capital at the expense of agriculture not desirable  AP govttold‘Big capital’ at the expense of agriculture not desirable, AP govt told
 Our Bureau
Tweet
 Visakhapatnam, December 3:  
The Andhra Pradesh Government should eschew the temptation to build ‘a big capital’ in competition with Hyderabad and at any rate agriculture should not be sacrificed on a large scale in that misplaced endeavour, according to speakers who participated in a meet organised by Jana Chaitanya Vedika in the public library here on Wednesday on the issue of the new capital.
Many of the speakers said the AP Government should not repeat the mistake of over-centralisation as it did in the past in the case of Hyderabad. Even if the capital came up in the Vijayawada-Guntur region, there was no justification for sacrificing as many as 30,000 acres of farm land for the purpose. Land acquisition should be minimised to the extent possible and there should not be any pressure on the farmers.
V Balamohana Das, former Vice-Chancellor of Acharya Nagarjuna University, said the provisions of the AP Reorganisation Act should be implemented sincerely and there should not be any unhealthy competition between AP and Telangana. The AP Government should take the farmers into confidence in acquiring lands for the capital. In awarding contracts for the works in the capital, there should be transparency and they should be awarded on the basis of international bidding. A master plan would have to be prepared carefully.
Ch Narasinga Rao, member of the secretariat of the CPM, said there was much resistance from farmers in 29 villages from where land is proposed to be acquired. He said it was notable that they were all of the ruling Telugu Desam Party but even then the farmers were resisting. He expressed doubts over the land pooling system proposed by the State Government for land acquisition.
PV Narayana Rao, city president of the BJP, said till now the State Government had not sent any proposal to the Union Government. The Union Government would have the final say on the matter, he said.
Several other speakers urged the State Government to go slow on the issue and not to sacrifice the interests of farmers. The emphasis should be on decentralisation.

Axis Bank set to ride the mobile banking waveAxis Bank set to ride the mobile banking wave
Our Bureau
Jairam Sridharan, President- Retail lending and Payments, Axis Bank, in Chennai on Wednesday BIJOY GHOSH
Chennai, December 3:  
Very soon your banker may send you a text message when you are shopping at a mall listing the shops that would give you discounts or cash back offers if you use the bank’s debit or credit card. According to Jairam Sridharan, President – Retail Lending and Payments, Axis Bank, the bank is exploring various possibilities to stay connected with its customers and to provide a convenient platform to transact their businesses through mobile apps.
Referring to Rs 1,000-crore business the bank transacted through its mobile platform in the last 15 months, Sridharan said, “From nothing fifteen months ago to Rs 1,000 crore, is something I have never seen before. Clearly, mobile platform will be the next big thing in the banking industry, and we want to ride the wave.”
Betting big on technology driven modules, the third largest private sector lender Axis Bank plans to focus more on unsecured loan portfolio in the retail banking division such as personal loans and credit cards. It eyes to double its personal loan business and credit card customer base in the next three years – growth driven predominantly by mobile phone applications. It is also expecting the credit card spend to grow two to three times from the current Rs 1,000 crore per month by that time.
Speaking to media persons here today, he however said the bank’s unsecured loan products will be targeted at its customers alone. “We have a (savings account) customer base of 1.5 crore, of this only 10 per cent is using our credit card as of now. This gives us enough reason to focus on our own customers first,” he said. As on today, with 1.5 million users, Axis is the fifth largest credit card issuer in the country, and in 2013-14, it has registered a growth of 84 per cent in credit card spend.
In the overall retail lending portfolio, the bank registered a 27 per cent growth during the current year so far to take the book size to Rs 90,000 crore as on September 30. With 53 per cent share of this book, Home Loan was the largest category for the bank. “Though housing is one of the most secured portfolios, we want to grow our unsecured loan book as it would be much more profitable, and delinquencies too have come down substantially in the last few years,” he pointed out.

Kerala govt may water down liquor policyKerala govt may water down liquor policy
Our Bureau
Kochi, December 3:  
Chief Minister Oommen Chandy has said his government will soon reformulate its controversial liquor policy.
Chandy told the Kerala Assembly on Wednesday that certain ‘practical changes’ would be made to the liquor policy on the basis of the observations made by the Kerala High Court and the criticisms levelled against the policy. He, however, made it clear that the spirit of the liquor policy would not be altered.
‘No changes required’
Immediately after Chandy’s statement in the Assembly, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president VM Sudheeran, a strong advocate of prohibition, whose stance had provoked the Chief Minister into announcing the tough liquor policy, said there was no need for making any changes. The liquor policy, whose crux is gradual prohibition over a ten-year period and shutdown of over 700 bars, has been criticised from with the Congress-led United Democratic Front as well as many organisations.
Tourism affected
The compulsory closure of the Government-owned Kerala State Beverages Corporation outlets, which supply nearly three-fourths of the liquor demand in the State, has come up for severe criticism.
The ‘Sunday, dry day’ policy is said to have particularly affected tourism. When the policy is redone, it is widely expected that the ‘Sunday dry day’ provision would be removed.
However, Sudheeran’s remarks show that the tussle between him and the Chandy government on the liquor policy will continue. However, the majority of the Congress leaders and MLAs are said to be for diluting the policy.

Fert Min for continuation of subsidy to closed urea plantsFert Min for continuation of subsidy to closed urea plants
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Dec 04, 2014 08:40 PM IST
To maintain domestic production of urea in the country, Fertilizer Ministry will soon move a Cabinet note for continuation of subsidy to three closed naphtha-based urea plants, including that of a UB Group firm.
These plants have been shut for about two months after the government discontinued subsidy on urea produced from costly naphtha as feedstock with effect from October 1. A proposal to reinstate the subsidy follows demands from Karnataka, where one of the three plants — that of Vijay Mallya-led UB Group firm Mangalore Chemicals & Fertilisers (MCFL) — is located. The other two plants belong to Madras Fertilizers and Southern Petrochemical Industries Corporation (SPIC).
“Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah requested for restarting the MCFL, I explained (to) him the subsidy burden as urea’s cost of production using Naphtha as feed- stock is around Rs 40,000 per tonne, whereas in case of gas it is around Rs 15,000 per tonne. We will propose to Union Cabinet to consider this issue,” Fertiliser Minister Ananth Kumar said. “I have also requested the Chief Minister to waive off the VAT on Naphtha so that subsidy could be reduced,” Kumar added.
The gas pipeline infrastructure to MCFL has not been set up yet, prompting Karnataka to demand continuation of the subsidy for the company’s plant.
In August, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs had approved continuation of production of urea from Madras Fertilizers, MCFL and Southern Petrochemical Industries Corporation using naphtha as feedstock for three months ending on September 30.
Kumar said, the proposal would be moved to the Cabinet as the objective is to maintain the present domestic production level of urea in the country. Meanwhile, MCFL is the only fertilizer plant in Karnataka and is takeover target of Deepak Fertilisers and Zuari Group. On October 1, MCFL had informed BSE that the plant has been shut from October this year due to expiry of permission given by the government for production of farm nutrient from high cost feedstock naphtha.
Earlier this week, main promoter Vijay Mallya resigned as director from his group firm MCFL, but no reasons were given. In the battle for control of MCFL, Mallya sided with Zuari group and launched the counter open offer to ward off the takeover bid of Deepak Fertilizers.
After the open offers of both Deepak and rival Zuari-UB group closed on October 20, Deepak Fertilisers’ stake in MCFL increased by about 6 per cent through an open offer to about 32 per cent and inched closer towards rival Zuari-UB group’s combined stake of 38.4 per cent.

Black Friday Crowds Thin After Thanksgiving Shopping RushBlack Friday Crowds Thin After Thanksgiving Shopping Rush

(Reuters) - Mall crowds were relatively thin early on Black Friday in a sign of what has become the new normal in U.S. holiday shopping: the mad rush is happening the night of Thanksgiving and more consumers are picking up deals online.
Most major retailers now open their doors Thursday evening and offer extended holiday deals rather than limiting them to one day. The result is a quieter experience on what has traditionally been the busiest, and sometimes most chaotic, shopping day of the year.
"It just looks like any other weekend," said Angela Olivera, a 32-year old housewife shopping for children's clothing at the Westfarms Mall near Hartford, Connecticut. "The kind of crowds we usually see are missing and this is one of the biggest malls here. I think people are just not spending a lot."
The crowds normally reserved for Black Friday morning appeared Thursday night. Over 15,000 people lined up for the opening of the flagship store of Macy's Inc (M.N) in New York on Thursday, Chief Executive Officer Terry Lundgren told CNN. Police responded to a handful of incidents at Wal-Mart Stores (WMT.N) on Thursday, including to break up a fight over a Barbie doll in Los Angeles, CNN said.
Target Corp (TGT.N) CEO Brian Cornell told Reuters he was encouraged by early indicators for a holiday season that "has moved from an event on Black Friday morning to a multi-day event."
"The consumer clearly enjoys shopping on Thanksgiving," Cornell said, noting the retailer was selling 1,800 televisions per minute nationwide between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. last night.
Wal-Mart said Thursday was its second-highest online sales day ever after last year's Cyber Monday, which is the Monday following Thanksgiving when online retailers promote bargains. Cornell said Target rang up a record day of online sales on Thursday.
Overall Thanksgiving Day online sales rose 14.3 percent from a year earlier, according to IBM Digital Analytics Benchmark.
The National Retail Federation is projecting that sales for November and December will rise 4.1 percent to $616.9 billion, which would mark the most bountiful holiday season in three years. Holiday sales grew 3.1 percent in 2013.
It was unclear what impact a movement to boycott Black Friday in protest of a grand jury's decision not to indict the police officer who shot and killed an unarmed black teenager in Missouri might have on the holiday season. The movement has gained some momentum on Twitter and Facebook.
OUR Walmart, a group of Wal-Mart employees pushing for higher wages and benefits, is also hoping to use Black Friday to spread its message with protests planned at 1,600 stores across the country.

Early reports show Cyber Monday sales increaseBy Sarah Halzack December 2 Follow @sarahhalzack

Online sales were strong on Cyber Monday and throughout the Thanksgiving weekend, an encouraging sign for retailers that invested heavily this year in enhancing their e-commerce offerings.
IBM reports that Cyber Monday sales were up 8.5 percent over last year, while sales for the period from Thanksgiving through Monday were up 12.6 percent.
The uptick came even as retailers had offered both in-store and digital deals earlier in November, creating incentives for shoppers to snap up Christmas gifts long before these traditional promotional events arrived.
The findings make clear just how rapidly consumers’ use of smartphones is changing the shopping experience. Mobile sales on Cyber Monday were 27.6 percent higher than last year, while mobile devices for the first time accounted for more than half of online traffic on Thanksgiving.
But the data also reveals that smartphones still primarily remain a tool for browsing, not buying. Smartphones accounted for 28.5 percent of total online traffic on Cyber Monday, and yet represented only 9.1 percent of total online sales.
Tablets, it seems, are used differently. They accounted for 12.5 percent of all online traffic, and yet they represented 12.9 percent of online sales. So tablet shoppers are closing the deal much more frequently than smartphone shoppers.
And although a desktop PC may not be the trendiest way to browse the Web, these devices still accounted for the lion’s share of online shopping on Monday. Desktop PCs account for the majority of online traffic and 78 percent of online sales. Consumers’ average order value was also highest on desktop.
IBM analyzed the differences between shoppers who used Apple’s iOS operating system and those who used Google’s Android. The company found that iOS users averaged $114.79 per order, compared with $96.84 for Android users. Users of Apple’s iOS also accounted for a larger share of online traffic and sales on Cyber Monday than Android users.
Adobe issued a separate analysis of Cyber Monday shopping that found that overall sales hit $2.65 billion, a 16 percent increase over last year. The technology company says that large retailers had the healthiest bumps in sales: The top 25 retailers in the United States saw 25 percent year-over-year online sales growth on Monday, while smaller retailers had growth of only 5 percent.
As has been the case in previous years, shopping peaked between 9 and 10 p.m., according to Adobe’s analysis of 400 million visits to 4,500 retail Web sites.
Wal-Mart, the nation’s largest retailer, said that it recorded its biggest day of orders ever on Cyber Monday, though the company did not disclose how many orders its received.  Its Web site, Walmart.com, drew 1.5 billion pageviews between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday, a five-day period in which the retailer was continuously offering fresh rounds of deals and promotions.
In a sign of how the lines between digital and in-person shopping are blurring, Wal-Mart reported that it saw a 70 percent increase on Cyber Monday in online orders that were picked up in stores.

Prime Minister tells BJP MPs to be cautious while making public comments while asking them not to “address the nation”
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday disapproved of the controversial remarks by Union Minister Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, saying such comments were “not acceptable” and asked party MPs to refrain from those that gave a bad name to the government and the party.
Sources said the Prime Minister, while addressing the BJP Parliamentary Party, told the MPs to be cautious while making public comments and asked them not to give any “address to the nation”.
Sources said the Prime Minister did not name anyone but later conveyed to the Minister concerned to regret the remarks made by her at a public rally in the national capital.
The remarks triggered a major controversy with the opposition forcing her to apologise. The issue also rocked Parliament, paralysing the functioning of the Rajya Sabha.

How big-company incubators tap into the innovation ecosystem0
Go back 10 years in health care where some provider systems were very early pilot sites. They’re scratching their heads over “How come we didn't get the economic value when we were earlier adopters?” When we play that middle role, some entrepreneurs are willing to put preferred pricing or performance incentives in place to ensure all who do want to be earlier in bringing new things on board have some aligned incentive as well.
B. Bonin Bough , VP of global media and consumer engagement at Mondelez International, on the cultural benefit of its Mobile Futures incubator program to collaborate with startups:
We wanted cultural transference. How do we transfer the startup culture into our thinking? It was one of the best things I’ve ever done in my career. When everybody came back after his or her one-week immersion, every single person was excited and raring to go. Then after Phase 2, every one of those marketers was forever changed. Now, every time somebody comes in with a mobile idea, they’ll have an interest to buy it. That’s long-term cultural impact.
Caralynn Nowinski , executive director and chief operating officer of University of Illinois’ Chicago-based UI Labs, on the advantages of corporate and startup collaboration:
Things change so quickly with startups. Exposing corporate folks to that culture can ultimately lead to more “intrapreneurship” and innovation. You can develop relationships with teams within startup companies where you’re getting more than just products. You’re getting that DNA of the startup the opportunity to infuse with a larger company.
Mike Latiner , president of Treehouse Adventures, the investment arm of design-build firm Clayco, on how it will invest in construction-related startups:
We’re looking at things like mobile technology and smart building products, which can be both more cost effective and energy efficient. When you combine that with some of these technologies that can make that building smarter, that allows the user of the building to have a better experience. Their iPhone becomes their security badge. Smart window technology tints the window based on the where the sun is and the weather outside. Getting back to core construction, we’re looking at technologies that can make that (construction) guy more efficient in the field with new tools and mobile devices that tell him where he needs to be and when.

European Shares Rise, Euro Falls as ECB Easing Bets Mount
Reuters | Updated On: December 03, 2014 15:32 (IST)
London: Stocks rose and the euro hit its weakest in more than two years on Wednesday, a day before a crucial European Central Bank (ECB) meeting that may pave the way for more monetary easing in the euro zone.
The dollar touched its highest against a basket of six major currencies since 2009.
Recent disappointing economic indicators from Europe have stoked investor concerns about the threat of deflation amid weak global growth, though this has also been offset by the prospect of more central bank intervention that would cheer markets.
Purchasing managers' surveys of the euro zone's service sector pointed on Wednesday to the tough task ahead for policymakers as business activity across the bloc grew less than expected last month, suggesting the region's economy could contract again early next year.
"There isn't a strong catalyst to help fuel the rally at the moment (but) this could change with the ECB tomorrow and Friday's (US) payroll figures," Saxo Bank trader Andrea Tueni said.
"(ECB head Mario) Draghi would please investors with some sort of timetable for quantitative easing, but even if he just repeats the ECB's strong commitment to act, it could be enough to spark a Santa Claus rally."
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 0.2 perc ent at 0854 GMT (2:24 p.m. in India), though top benchmark indexes in Britain and France were down slightly.
The oil price rebounded above $71 a barrel as a volatile market searched for a floor after the price fell nearly 40 per cent since June, while the dollar hit its highest since March 2009 as US Federal Reserve officials painted an upbeat picture of the world's biggest economy. ( Read more )
Sterling rose after better-than-expected data from the UK as the market awaited British Finance Minister George Osborne's half-yearly budget update later on Wednesday. He was expected to pledge to wipe out the underlying budget deficit in three years, part of a plan to eventually offer generous income tax cuts.
German bund futures were firmer as core bond yields fell, with Italy's borrowing costs hitting a new record low of 2 per cent.
Nordic shares were buoyed by news that telecom operators Telenor and TeliaSonera would merge their Danish operations. Both stocks were up around 1.7 per cent.
The Russian rouble's continuing slide added more pressure on companies exposed to Eastern Europe: Germany's Adidas fell 2.7 per cent after a broker downgrade from Barclays warned that the company's exposure to the rouble would probably eat into profits through 2015.
The MSCI Emerging Market index was down 0.3 per cent, with the stronger dollar and oil's recent slide keeping pressure on emerging-market currencies.
Brent crude was firmer at $71.12 per barrel while US crude also rose to around $67.65, stabilising after hitting multi-year lows on a supply glut and fears of cooling demand.

200 000 dead Why Syrias rising death toll is so divisiveBy Adam Taylor December 3 Follow @mradamtaylor

On Tuesday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) announced that the war in Syria had reached a grim milestone: Since the conflict began, they had documented the killing of 202,354 people.
And as high as that number is, in a phone call with The Post, SOHR director Rami Abdul Rahman explained it was likely too low. He estimated that 280,000 people had actually died but his group had not been able to verify all the deaths among regime forces or in the Islamic State and Jabhat al-Nusra.
Either way, it's a terrible figure, and significantly up from SOHR's last estimate of 150,000 in April. But this new figure is also a reminder of how little we really know about the death toll in Syria -- and why the figures we do have can become politically controversial.
International bodies have publicly struggled to count the dead in Syria. At the beginning of this year, the United Nations announced it would stop updating its death toll due to concerns about its accuracy (it had last been updated in July 2013, when it stood at 100,000).
"It was always very close to the edge in terms of how much we could guarantee the source material was accurate," Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights,  told the Associated Press . "And it reached a point where we felt we could no longer cross that line."
In August, UNHCR reversed that decision, and instead released a  new report that said that 191,369 had died since the beginning of the conflict until April 2014, in part based on SOHR's figures. Colville then  cautioned that the figures were “indicative” rather than “gospel truth."
On Tuesday, Abdul Rahman expressed doubt about the U.N.'s figures, and questioned why there was little detail about those who had died. "If you are collecting everything, then you should should show everything," he said.
Given the scarcity of reliable information from international organizations, activist-run groups like SOHR have filled the void. They are frequently cited in media reports and by government officials, yet outside observers might be surprised at how ad hoc their operation is: SOHR is based in Coventry, Britain, where Abdul Rahman settled when he fled Syria more than a decade ago. While Abdul Rahman coordinates everything from his British base, he says he uses a network in Syria to help collect and corroborate his information. Last year  Abdul Rahman told the New York Times  that he had four men working from inside Syria and a network of more than 230 activists on the ground.
Abdul Rahman's methods have been criticized by others following the conflict. When the group released its 150,000 figure in April, James Miller, managing editor of the Interpreter and an expert on the Syrian conflict, tweeted a number of disparaging remarks. "Everything about that chart screams BS!" he  tweeted at one point , before  explaining that he knew  "field reporters who have never encountered a SOHR source in Syria."
"There are hundreds, perhaps thousands of examples why [SOHR] is a terrible source," Miller explained in a follow-up email to The Post, before citing a list of his own criticism, including that moderate rebels were listed as civilians in the data – an apparent change to the methodology that was  also noted by Micah Zenko at the Council of Foreign Relations . Miller argued that the way SOHR broke down their numbers between civilians and jihadists showed that they were "significantly less objective" than other groups tracking data, though he added that their bias was unclear.
Abdul Rahman is generally perceived to be in opposition to Bashar al-Assad's Syrian regime, but at times the motivation behind SOHR can seem more complex. Recently, the organization began drawing attention to what it said were civilian deaths created by U.S. airstrikes. That created an awkward situation for the United States , which had frequently cited the organization's statistics. "Nobody is happy with our work, because nobody wants the truth to come out," Abdul Rahman told the Huffington Post in November . "Our group doesn't have the whole truth, but we are very close."
Perhaps the most common criticism of SOHR is that it doesn't share its data or methodology, meaning that it is difficult, if not impossible, to check. There is not much to check it against, anyway: The next most prominent group counting the number of deaths in Syria is the Violations Documenting Center (VDC). "They basically endeavor to have more than one activist in a location, and the activists are not in touch," Lama Fakih of Human Rights Watch told  the New Republic approvingly last year . "They collect info separately, and they use that separate analysis to corroborate the info they’re receiving.”
VDC's website currently estimates that 108,679 "revolutionary martyrs" have been killed. Bassam al-Ahmad, a spokesperson for the VDC, told The Post earlier this year that SOHR's numbers seem realistic, but their own methods for confirming the dead are relatively strict (for example, they only count those whose names they can confirm) and thus skew lower.
Counting the dead in any conflict is difficult. Estimates for the number of dead in the Iraq war can range between 110,937 (on the low end  of the Iraq Body Count project estimate ) to 655,000 (from  an especially controversial 2006 Lancet study ), and the methodologies of estimates can be political – one recent report suggested  that the death tolls from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the Darfur conflict were deliberately exaggerated . Such discrepancies are hardly a new phenomenon: Estimates for the number of Germans who died in World War II can vary between 4 million and 5.3 million,  for example .
"I think in a way social media has raised some people's expectations when it come to verifying deaths," Eliot Higgins, a British blogger who has  tracked the war under the name Moses Brown , wrote in an email. "With so many deaths shown in pictures and videos, it seems some people are unwilling just to accept numbers any more, they want videos of corpses before they'll accept anything. It sort of creates an unrealistic expectation of what's required to verify a death in a conflict like Syria, and really people will believe the figures they want to believe."
There still remains hope that one day people in Syria will face trial for war crimes, however, and evidence on deaths collected by SOHR and other groups may prove important. Sadly, it appears that there are few critics who think SOHR's estimates are too low. Some think they should be higher.

Kudankulam: Cost of units 3  4 surpasses Rs ...Fast Breeder Reactor
(The approved cost of unit…)
NEW DELHI: Due to liability issues, the cost of units 3 and 4 of Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant has shot up to Rs 39,747 crore, more than twice the cost of units 1 and 2, which will lead to an increase in per unit cost of power.
The approved cost of unit 1 and 2 is Rs 17,270 crore while the approved cost of unit 3 and 4 is Rs 39,747 crore, Minister of State for Department of Atomic Energy, Jitendra Singh , said in a written response to a question in Lok Sabha today.
Sources in DAE pointed out that the high price was due to the liability issue under which the operators and suppliers have to insure the units. All the four reactors, with a capacity of 1000 MW each, have been built with Russian assistance.
The unit, which was shut down due to technical reasons, is expected to start generating power this week. It was connected to southern grid in October 2013 when then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh visited Russia.
The approved cost of Prototype Fast Breeder Reaactor at Kalpakkam is Rs 5,677 crore, while units 7 and 8 of Rajasthan Atomic Power Station (RAPS) is Rs 12,320 crore. For units 3 and 4 of Kakrapar 11,459 have been approved.
Unit 1 of Kudankulam achieved full power in June 2014 and has so far generated 2825 MW electricity.
While the Unit 2 in at commissioning stage.

How Seventh Circuit motions panels workBy Will Baude December 3
Over the summer I posted a couple of times about the rather unusual procedural treatment of a Seventh Circuit appeal in Motorola Mobility. Here’s my initial post . Eventually the case was vacated and set for oral argument, and one of the lingering questions was whether the case would be reheard by the same motions panel that had already pre-decided the case. Well the second draft of the opinion came out last week , decided by the same panel, and written once again by Judge Posner.
One interesting question this prompts is how the motions panels and merits panels in the Seventh Circuit actually relate in practice. How are motions panels picked, and when do the motions panels get to hold a case for oral argument.
Ed Whelan at Bench Memos posted queries about this and got informative responses from Chief Judge Diane Wood and from former Chief Judge Frank Easterbrook . They’re worth reading for those who follow Seventh Circuit procedure or appellate procedure generally. One revelation that particularly interested me is that according to Judge Easterbrook, the Seventh Circuit does not quite follow its own posted internal operating procedures :
3. Although the operating procedures say that the panel will refer the matter to the Chief Judge for assignment, this rarely happens–and no one wants it to be done routinely. As a practical matter, the issue is referred to the Chief Judge only when the panel is internally divided about whether to retain the case for decision on the merits. During my seven years as Chief Judge, that happened only once. I assigned that case to the motions panel for decision on the merits.
There’s been some talk about the non-randomness of appellate panels lately, including this study by my friends Marin Levy and Adam Chilton. It looks like we’ve just found another source of non-randomness.
(Kudos are due, by the way, to Judges Wood and Easterbrook for being forthcoming about these procedures. It would have been easy not to be.)
Update: Here’s more from Alison Frankel at Reuters , including a link to another paper on non-randomness on the Seventh Circuit. (Judge Easterbrook’s brief comments on the paper are in the Frankel story.)

Fraternities  journalism and introspectionBy Cameron Barr December 3 Follow @cameronbarr
Protestors carry signs in front of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity house at the University of Virginia late Saturday night, Nov. 22, 2014, in Charlottesville, Va. (AP Photo/The Daily Progress, Ryan M. Kelly)
Fraternities are having a really bad year. First came Caitlin Flanagan’s cinematic takedown   in the March issue of The Atlantic , a much-discussed and very long screed that began with an opening anecdote that captured much of what is wrong with fraternity culture, at least from a certain point of view:
One warm spring night in 2011, a young man named Travis Hughes stood on the back deck of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity house at Marshall University, in West Virginia, and was struck by what seemed to him—under the influence of powerful inebriants, not least among them the clear ether of youth itself—to be an excellent idea: he would shove a bottle rocket up his ass and blast it into the sweet night air. And perhaps it was an excellent idea. What was not an excellent idea, however, was to misjudge the relative tightness of a 20-year-old sphincter and the propulsive reliability of a 20-cent bottle rocket. What followed ignition was not the bright report of a successful blastoff, but the muffled thud of fire in the hole.
That is the sort of beginning that effectively generates propulsion. The reader is sent hurtling along Flanagan’s grand tour of the many failings of fraternities — chiefly hazing deaths, sexual assault, and the voluminous ingestion of alcohol — and how powerful alumni and weak-willed university administrators sustain a systematic avoidance of liability. Based on a year of reporting, she builds a case for change, noting that stories like hers are not infrequent:
Articles like this one are a source of profound frustration to the fraternity industry, which believes itself deeply maligned by a malevolent press intent on describing the bad conduct of the few instead of the acceptable—sometimes exemplary—conduct of the many. But when healthy young college students are gravely injured or killed, it’s newsworthy. When there is a common denominator among hundreds of such injuries and deaths, one that exists across all kinds of campuses, from private to public, prestigious to obscure, then it is more than newsworthy: it begins to approach a national scandal.
Then came a White House-endorsed national discussion of sexual assault on college campus, a debate in which Greek houses figure more prominently as problem, or even as crime scene, than as solution, and the news that the Justice Department was investigating dozens of universities for failing to adequately investigate sexual violence. Last month another journalistic bombshell hit: a Rolling Stone piece recounting an alleged gang rape at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity house at the University of Virginia. The piece and the ensuing uproar prompted university president Teresa Sullivan to suspend fraternity and sorority operations until January, making U-Va. one of several institutions to take action against the Greek system this year.
Through it all, fraternities have promised cooperation, as does a statement from the Virginia alpha chapter of Phi Kappa Psi , which said: “We remain ready and willing to assist with the fair and swift pursuit of justice, wherever that may lead, and steadfast in our resolve to ensure that nothing like this can happen, ever on our Grounds.”
But as sometimes happens in the wake of a story with singular impact, journalists began to scrutinize the Rolling Stone piece. Author and editor Richard Bradley, a one-time editor of the famed journalistic fabricator Stephen Glass, conveyed his misgivings about the article in a blog post on Nov. 24 . “I’m not sure that I believe it. I’m not convinced that this gang rape actually happened. Something about this story doesn’t feel right,” Bradley wrote.
Post media reporter Paul Farhi  noted in a profile of Sabrina Rubin Erdely , the freelancer who wrote the Rolling Stone piece, that she wouldn’t say in an interview whether she knew the identities of the alleged attackers or whether she had approached the ringleader for comment. Erik Wemple, the Post’s media blogger, dissected an interview Erdely gave to Slate in which she sounds evasive on the matter of contacting the alleged attackers for comment. Wemple rendered judgment : “The charge in this piece, however, is gang rape, and so requires every possible step to reach out and interview them, including e-mails, phone calls, certified letters, FedEx letters, UPS letters and, if all of that fails, a knock on the door. No effort short of all that qualifies as journalism.” Rolling Stone, in a statement to Wemple, defended its story about the woman Erdely called “Jackie,” citing the author’s “extensive reporting and fact–checking.”
Rebecca Traister, writing Monday in New Republic , probed the effect of this scrutiny:
The dismantling of Erdely’s story—both by anti-feminist agonistes and by those genuinely dismayed by possible journalistic error—would mean that Jackie’s story of being beaten and raped by seven fraternity brothers will be dismissed, and that the reading public will be permitted to slip back into the comforting conviction that stories like Jackie’s aren’t real, that rapes like that don’t happen, that our system works, and that, of course, bitches lie.
Journalism, as an institution, is in no way immune from lapse or failure or malfeasance. But journalism has one thing over the Greek system — a talent for introspection, sometimes for inquisition, played out in public, for all to see. Fraternity brothers and university administrators should take note.

A telecom regulator accuses Netflix of trying to create its own fast lanesBy Brian Fung December 3 Follow @b_fung

Netflix is trying to gain an unfair advantage over its competitors by setting up "fast lanes" for its content, according to a Republican regulator at the Federal Communications Commission.
In a letter Tuesday, FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai said a Netflix program designed to smooth out video playback enables Netflix to "run the equivalent of a 100-yard dash while its competitors' videos would have to run a marathon."
The letter comes amid continued debate over how the FCC should regulate Internet providers to prevent them from speeding up or slowing down some Web sites over others.
The Netflix program in question, known as Open Connect, stores video content inside the networks of Internet service providers so that the content doesn't need to travel as far to reach viewers at home. The result is often faster service, and Netflix has urged ISPs to participate in the program by letting the company connect proprietary boxes to the ISPs' internal networks. To date, " hundreds " of broadband companies have agreed, according to Netflix. But others, including major providers like Comcast and Verizon, have balked — leading to declines in streaming quality until Netflix started signing separate, paid agreements with those ISPs to improve service.
In part because of those commercial deals, Netflix and its allies have called for aggressive oversight of broadband companies. If the industry is allowed to prioritize some Web sites over others — especially in exchange for payment — content providers would need to pay up to succeed.
The commissioner's letter seeks to turn the rhetorical tables on Netflix, arguing that Netflix's arrangements through Open Connect aren't much different from the company's nightmare scenario.
"If ISPs were to install open caching appliances throughout ISPs' networks, all video content providers — including Netflix — could compete on a level playing field," Pai wrote. Instead, he said, Netflix insists on requiring Open Connect partners to use closed, proprietary hardware designed by Netflix itself.
A Netflix spokesperson declined to comment on Pai's letter.
A key distinction between Open Connect and the paid fast lanes to which Pai compares the program is that Netflix does not charge ISPs a fee. Nor does Netflix control access to Internet users in the way that broadband companies do.
Even if Open Connect is free, said Geoffrey Manne, a libertarian economist who has urged the FCC to adopt lighter regulations, there are still certain costs associated with allowing Netflix into an ISP's network.
"While the boxes themselves may be at a zero price," said Manne, "they're definitely not free in the sense that there's all sorts of equipment and maintenance and space and electricity that are required to maintain them."
But in an interview earlier this year, a broadband industry official denied that cost was the stumbling block.
"It's not the cost — we just don't have anybody's servers inside our network," said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to speak publicly. If they allowed Netflix in, the official added, "does that mean I have to put an Amazon server in my network, and a Yahoo server in my network?"
That Amazon or Yahoo could approach an ISP and ask to install their own boxes suggests Netflix, much as it benefits from Open Connect, may not be benefiting all that unfairly. If any companies might be harmed by this practice, it would be smaller firms that cannot afford to run similar programs of their own. But few firms traffic in so much data that they require a program like Open Connect in the first place, and there exists a robust third-party market that provides similar content delivery services. In short, the barrier to more ISPs agreeing to programs like Open Connect is simply the ISPs themselves, who can approve or reject a content company's advances for any reason.
Some Netflix critics warn that strong federal rules against prioritization of Web traffic might wind up backfiring, effectively making Netflix's Open Connect illegal.
"There's nothing wrong with what Netflix is doing," said Berin Szoka, president of the libertarian group TechFreedom, "except its sanctimonious hypocrisy."
But the alternative — when ISPs refuse to participate in Open Connect on principle and instead require Netflix to pay a fee to connect to users — is worse, according to public interest advocates.
"They like having control of their network," said Harold Feld, senior vice president of the consumer group Public Knowledge. "Their attitude is, 'We want to do it in a particular way, and we want to make you do it in a particular way.'
"Normally we say [to the ISPs], 'It's your business,' but sometimes when your business is part of critical infrastructure — this isn't just about Netflix and Comcast, these fights affect everybody — when we have these fights over basic services, that's where the government needs to step in as a referee and prevent you and I from being squashed when the elephants dance."

Looking for just the right word...in another languageBy Neely Tucker December 3 Follow @neelytucker
Our copy of “ Lost in Transalation ,” a great little book of words for which there are no direct translations into English, went tsundoku for a while.
Which is to say, in Japanese. “leaving a book unread after buying it, typically piled up with other unread books.”  Our desk tends to be top-heavy with tsundoku, but maybe there’s a word in yet other language for “the time we’d like to have to read books but we don’t, so there.”
Ella Frances Sanders first book — she’s in her early 20s — is subtitled “An Illustrated Compendium of Untranslatable Words from Around the World.” It arose from a blog item she did last year, and pulls together about half-a-hundred nouns, verbs or adjectives from major and minor languages that get at things English can’t or hasn’t. A British national, she’s an illustrator wandering around Europe rather than an Ivory-tower-bound academic, and the book is carried by her whimsical drawings of the concepts she’s rendering.
This untranslatable-words concept was explored at more length in “ The Meaning of Tingo ,” by Adam Jacot de Boinod several years ago, but Sanders’ illustrations are as much the point here as the words themselves. You know when you pull off those tight socks, undies or a bracelet? And it leaves that temporary indentation on your skin? That doo-hickey is karelu, in Tulu, spoken in parts of India. German, which has a word for just about everything, contributes kummerspeck, which tranlates as “grief bacon,” but means the weight you gain from emotional overeating. When somebody teases you for that, and you only think of a devastating comeback after they walk away, what you have there is trepverter, Yiddish for “a witty riposte or comeback you think of only when it is too late.” (Otherwise known as the “Jerk Store” rule.)
But let’s close with two lovely ones. First, from the frozen north of Scandinavia, is mangata, Swedish for the “road-like reflection of the moon in the water.” As on the ocean, a lake, a slow-moving river.
And we cross the globe, back to Japan, for a last, delicately beautiful word for the season. We are no longer in the harsh glare of summer sunlight, and not yet into weak, watery light of January. On a fine autumn afternoon, there is still time for komorebi, the light beneath the leaves.
Yes. Exactly.

Why Stopping to Smell the Roses Is Crucial for Your BusinessAre you feeling stressed out?
If you are an entrepreneur, you may have a hard time taking time off for yourself.
I have a hard time sometimes, when I get so enthusiastic with my work that I forget about the hours passing by! But in order to live in abundance, we need to give a time and a space to each aspect of our lives: health, spirituality, relationships, family, finances.
When we neglect certain areas of our lives, we start feeling out of balance and eventually stressed out!
Does this ring a bell to you?
Do you have a never-ending "to do" list?
When one task gets crossed off of the list, three more show up. It is all part of growing your business, dreaming bigger and getting things done.
We need to understand that there will never be a final line that we will cross before we are done and can take a break.
When you are creating your business, there are always more tasks. You might have the feeling that you need to keep going and keep getting things done in order to succeed.
I've seen people around me getting burned out by this "go-getter" pattern. I am a total Type A personality, who loves to sets goals and move towards them. But at the same time I've come to recognize that there is a time to rest.
For example, if you've been struggling for months to start your coaching practice and finally got your first clients, it is okay to enjoy that for a while before you go on to newer and bigger goals.
We need to learn to stop to smell the roses.
It is important that we acknowledge our business victories, as big or as small as they may be, and that we celebrate and honor them. This is how the Universe works when we manifest abundance.
When we are grateful and enjoy what we have today, then we will receive more tomorrow.
Part of being grateful for your tiny or huge successes, is to allow them to become a part of you before you move into the next great thing.
Sit with them, take a break, enjoy your few clients before you take on the world with a huge new enterprise, at least for a little while.
The carrot will always be there dangling and tempting us to do more. It is important for us to honor what we've accomplished so far, enjoy it and embrace it fully before we move forward in our creation.
If you are a go-getter, here's some news:
You can rest
You can have some fun (hopefully a lot)
You can enjoy what you've achieved so far. Even if it's not your ultimate goal, it is a great stepping stone toward it!
And the best part is that if you stop for a second (or for as long as you want) before going on to your next big goal, your business WILL NOT COLLAPSE.
You can set aside that sense of urgency, the little voice that says you have to produce constantly.
The Universe has its way of delivering its abundance into your life. Sometimes we are so worried and busy producing more, that we actually block the gifts that the Universe is trying to give us.
There is a time for everything, a process to be done and lessons to be learned as we manifest our dreams.
Allow it to work its flow by relaxing, letting it be what it is today, and giving it all up in loving gratitude.
If you want to get clarity around your business, and in turn, have more time and space to stop and smell the roses, I'd love to show you how! I'm hosting a Live Mastermind event in Austin, TX on December 12. I hope you can join me!

Q: How do I get rid of paper stock certificates?
A: The financial industry wants to banish paper. That includes your lovely paper stock certificates. But getting rid of them takes legwork.
The first step is turning your certificate into an electronic form of ownership. Brokerages have been burned by people opening accounts, mailing in certificates, selling them and then closing their accounts. To discourage this, most brokerages charge hundreds of dollars to process paper certificates. But if you you have an existing and long-term relationship with a broker, now’s the time to ask for a favor. Many will process paper certificates for free or at a reasonable cost for people who have been customers for some time. If you just want to cash in stock, and don’t have a brokerage, it’s best to work with the company’s transfer agent, or the firm with the job of tracking a shareholders.
Start the process by calling the transfer agent. You can then mail the shares to the agent, who will hold the shares digitally in an account for you. If you want to sell the shares, the transfer agent will do that for a cost. Computershare, one of the biggest transfer agents, will process your paper certificates for free, says Paul Capozzi of Computershare. Selling costs vary, but usually are $15 plus 12 cents a share.

Sailing to Agra on Yamuna will be a reality soon: Gadkari41

New Delhi: People will soon be able to go to Agra sailing on the Yamuna as the Centre has sought help from the Netherlands government for the ambitious project that includes building barrages and water-terminals on both sides of the river.
"Soon people can go to Agra via Delhi through Yamuna...We will float a Cabinet note within 10 days to specify works for the project by our Ministry and the Delhi Government," Road Transport, Highways and Shipping Minister Nitin Gadkari said.
"We will request Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to ensure special funds for the project," he said.
People will soon be able to go to Agra sailing on the Yamuna as the Centre has sought help from the Netherlands government for the ambitious project that includes building barrages and water-terminals on both sides of the river.
#nitin gadkari #yamuna #delhi agra route
After chairing a high-level meet to discuss the project, Gadkari said the Netherlands government has agreed to come out with a technical report for the project which includes specifications regarding construction of barrages and two water-terminals at both ends of Yamuna.
"Netherlands has expertise in this in the world. I had a talk with the Netherlands Ambassador. We have asked a Netherlands government agency to prepare the project management report including technical consultancy, for which they have agreed," he said.
Gadkari said barrages would be constructed to ensure at least five metres water in Yamuna round-the-year to ensure passengers and goods transportation through the waterways.
He added that more barrages would be constructed ahead of Wazirabad so that Delhi does not face water-crisis and if need be talks will be held with the Haryana government.
"We have already given nod to seaplanes. We are allowing hovercrafts. We are constructing water-terminals at both the ends of Yamuna on the pattern of airports," he said.
Unveiling the plans, Gadkari said Delhi Development Authority will beautify the riverbanks while the Delhi Jal Board will prevent effluents from being released in Yamuna.
Officials of the Ministry of Shipping in consultation with Delhi Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung will integrate the scheme, he said.
Gadkari said his ministry has accorded highest priority to development of waterways in the country which has been "sadly" ignored so far with the country's goods and passenger transport through the mode barely at 0.5 per cent of the total transport in comparison to China where the percentage was 20 per cent.
The stress is being given on waterways from Varanasi to Kolkata and from Delhi to Agra now in addition to the existing five waterways in the country, he said.

The massive level of interest in the thoughts of Elizabeth Lauten , until this week the communications director for Tennessee Republican Rep. Stephen Fincher, on Malia and Sasha Obama stunned me -- and a number of my colleagues with whom I raised my surprise.
Yes, I get why criticizing the dress and demeanor of two teenagers in the White House created some controversy. And, I totally understand that saying two teenage girls were looking for a "spot at the bar" was even more distasteful. Leaving politicians' kids out of the national conversation is one of the few boundaries that remain in politics and political journalism. But, why was Lauten SUCH a big story -- covered by cable relentlessly, driving scads of traffic online and even being picked up by the national nightly news?
Republican National Committee communications director Sean Spicer asked just that question in a trio of tweets Tuesday night.

— Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) December 1, 2014
So, why did Lauten become SUCH a big story?  A few reasons, which I offer below. To be clear, this is not an attempt to fully  justify everything that was written and said about Lauten, Rather, it's an attempt to explain why it was such an alluring story for so many.
1. Our reflexive defensiveness about kids being dragged into politics.  You can say anything you want about an adult -- or damn close to it -- without causing all that much controversy. But, critique kids -- particularly how they dress/look/act -- and you walk into a political minefield. Remember that we were all young once and well all felt the horrendousness of being an insecure teenager worried about what everyone thinks of you.  To go through that stage of your life in the full glare of the country is hard enough. To have to deal with snide comments from the sidelines while also weathering that stage is out of bounds.  Then there is the inborn defensiveness of everyone who is a parent about having their children judged by strangers. As the dad of two young boys, it's okay for me or my wife to tell the kids to mind their manners or not wear whatever they have on. But if some stranger did it, I would go nuts.  Combine those two factors and you see a sort of universality of experience that made the story so interesting for so many.
2. The slow news cycle. The Lauten news broke over the long Thanksgiving weekend. It crested on Monday when she resigned just as people were starting to get back into their normal daily routines. There was a vacuum of interesting news stories -- the Packers-Patriots game notwithstanding -- and Lauten filled that vacuum. That's not an excuse for the coverage, it's a fact. It's possible that if Lauten had said what she said in the midst of some other major news event it might not have caused anywhere near the level of controversy that it did. But, it happened at a time when there wasn't much else going on to knock it from the homepage/lead of newscasts.
3. Traffic/Ratings.  Yes, there's no question that the Lauten story -- in all its forms -- did quite well for The Washington Post (and virtually every other news site in the country).  I tweeted about that fact on Monday :
Of the five most read stories on @washingtonpost , 4 of them are about Elizabeth Lauten.
— Chris Cillizza (@TheFix) December 1, 2014
That led many -- mostly conservatives -- to conclude that the only reason that Lauten was such big news was because it represented a life raft for the perpetually-drowning mainstream media. "They'll chase anything that gets them page views," the thinking goes.
That's an easy analysis. But I think it overlooks a deeper conversation about what traffic/ratings mean.  I view my role as a journalist to dive into stories that people are most interested in and explain/analyze/report on them. I want to be where the national conversation is at any given moment.  Whether that's campaign politics, Ferguson, health care, the Supreme Court or Charles Barkley, I want to find a way to look at it through our unique (I hope) political lens and write something from there. Am I aware that doing that could/will generate traffic? I am. Is my prime motivation in doing so getting traffic? It is not. Anyone who is in journalism wants to be writing and reporting on the topics that average people are talking about and caring about. That's the nature of why we do what we do.
What comes first? The traffic or the interest?
4. The distaste for everything with the taint of "Washington politics." People hate Washington. As a result, they like hate-reading (or hate-watching) anything that affirms for them the essential loathsomeness of the nation's capital.  Lauten using the Obamas' daughters to make a broader point -- that the president and first lady lack class and may be wanting on the patriotism front -- was, for many people who don't pay all that much attention to politics (which is most people), confirmation of just how low Washington has sunk. And, who doesn't want something/someone to look down on?
One last point: I do not believe that the reason the Lauten story was such big news was because she is a Republican.  While it's an imperfect analog, the controversy surrounding health-care consultant Jonathan Gruber is instructive. His comments that the stupidity of the American public was one of the main reasons the Affordable Care Act passed were unearthed by conservative media. But, The Post -- and The Fix -- did lots on Gruber too. ( He won "Worst Week in Washington"! )  By my count, the Fix wrote one piece on Lauten -- a look at how presidential kids have been treated throughout history . I, personally, wrote a two pieces about Gruber -- the "Worst Week" one and this one on why conservatives seized on him . Several other members of the Fix wrote other Gruber-related stuff.
That's not to suggest that bias in coverage is entirely determined by word counts. But, for me, the idea that the key to understanding the Lauten coverage is the media's bias against Republicans just doesn't hold up.

Corporate tax reform cant be done aloneBy Jennifer Rubin December 3 Follow @JRubinBlogger
Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who will be the new House Ways and Means Committee chairman, made comments on Tuesday that seem to have been misinterpreted by much of the media. Reporters suggest that he would be  keen on pursuing only corporate tax reform without pursuing the knotty individual side of the code. In fact, what he said was, “If we can get halfway toward comprehensive tax reform, as a step in the right direction, I think that’s great.” That is a far cry from doing one side of  the job — only corporate reform. 
Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) (Steve Helber/Associated Press)
Ryan’s thinking has not changed on this, people familiar with his plans affirm. He has repeatedly said that his goal is to see how much work can get done with this White House. In the same interview, he cautioned that the individual side must be addressed as well. As one GOP source put it, “No one is interested in reforms that leave small businesses hanging.”
That is a reference to the S-corporations that pay taxes under the individual rates. (In the same interview, Ryan called this a “ big wrinkle .”) If only corporation rates are lowered, some small businesses would be encouraged to change tax status to take advantage of the lower rates rather than pay under the current individual rate. It will become one more regulatory burden for small business to jump through. Indeed on the Budget Committee Web site Ryan explains :
Currently, the U.S. corporate tax rate is just over 39 percent – the highest rate in the industrialized world. Additionally, the top federal rate on smaller, unincorporated businesses reaches 44.6 percent. Roughly half of all U.S. active business income and half of private-sector employment are derived from these businesses – such as partnerships, S corporations, and sole proprietorships. These high tax rates discourage investment and job creation, distort business activity, and put American businesses at a competitive disadvantage. It is also important to note that in Wisconsin; approximately 9 out of 10 businesses file their taxes as individuals. These small businesses, known as “sub-chapter S corporations,” limited liability corporations (LLCs) and partnerships employ more than half of all private sector workers. With two-thirds of the net new jobs in America being created by small businesses, raising taxes on these businesses would kill job creation—especially at a time when some of our foreign competitors are lowering their tax rates on business as low as 15 percent. By making the tax code more conducive to innovation and investment, we can stimulate job growth and get the economy back on the road to recovery.
Moreover, from a political standpoint both parties have always bristled at the idea of reforming — lowering rates — for business and leaving individuals to muddle along with the existing system. It would be a decidedly non-populist move that political opponents would wield against them.
No one should be overly optimistic about tax reform. The basic impasse — the Democrats only want a tax hike and Republicans want a revenue-neutral plan — remains. Moreover, it is hard to do “a little” tax reform. The difficulty comes in the numerous trade-offs and specific provisions, which affect business investment, determine the progressivity of the code and implement public policy (e.g. the charitable deduction). Moreover, Republicans, if they get to health-care reform, will be looking to add a complication on the individual side with a tax credit to equalize treatment of individually-purchased health-care insurance plans. And to top it off there is a growing debate on the GOP side between those who want to focus solely on lower rates and growth, and other reformers who have growth plus other goals like relief for child rearing and expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit.
Frankly, I am not all that sure that tax reform should be at or near the top of the to-do list for 2015. Tax rates are not where they were when Ronald Reagan came into office, and a slew of Americans do not pay federal income tax under the Bush tax cuts. For a huge political headache, there may not be that much bang for the buck. There are other areas that may be more fruitful and easier to achieve in the pro-growth arena including a domestic energy development policy, regulatory relief (needed more than ever with the president’s latest decree on greenhouse gases) and completion of trade deals.
Maybe a discrete deal on an  item like tax repatriation (when corporations can be lured into bringing overseas profits back to the United States without getting a double tax hit) is possible. Beyond that, I would not hold your breath for a slimmed down tax code. To the contrary, widespread support for the so-called tax extenders suggests the same old tax code will be with us for a while.

Wall Street ticks up, energy stocks rally again

(US stocks rose slightly,…)
NEW YORK: US stocks rose slightly on Wednesday, led by commodity-related shares, as data continued to show a strengthening US economy and ahead of a meeting of the European Central Bank.
Markets reacted mutedly to data showing the US private sector created 208,000 jobs last month, fewer than expected. The numbers, however, suggested a slowing global economy is having a limited impact on domestic activity.
Stocks in the energy sector led gains for a second consecutive day as crude prices slightly bounced from five year lows. The S&P 500 energy sector added 1.6 per cent.
The largest per centage gainer on the S&P 500 was land drilling contractor and oil services company Nabors Industries , which rose 6.1 per cent to $13.66.
"Maybe the pessimism has been overshot to the downside," said King Lip, chief investment officer at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco, regarding the recent slide in oil futures and energy stocks.
He said energy company insiders are much more bullish about the current situation than the overall market, citing stock purchases from high-ranking insiders.
"It's expected, but nonetheless a bullish indicator. It is a good time to start picking names in the sector."
At 10:57 a.m. EST (1557 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average rose 15.27 points, or 0.09 per cent, to 17,894.82, the S&P 500 gained 4.79 points, or 0.23 per cent, to 2,071.34 and the Nasdaq Composite added 3.45 points, or 0.07 per cent, to 4,759.26.
The Dow hit an intraday record high and the S&P was within four points of its record set last week.
  A gauge of growth in the US services sector rose more than expected in November even as its employment component dipped, according to ISM, while Markit's reading of the sector showed growth, though as a slower clip.
Earlier data showed the euro zone economy may face another contraction after business activity grew less than expected in November despite heavy discounting, although Asian readings were more upbeat. The euro was trading at its lowest against the US dollar in more than two years.
Momentum is building for the ECB to launch a program of sovereign-bond buying to boost the bloc's struggling economy with most signs pointing to March for a decision. The ECB meets on Thursday.
"I don't know if they're going to take a huge step but they are moving in that direction," said Jim Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 2,124 to 766, for a 2.77-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,598 issues rose and 932 fell for a 1.71-to-1 ratio.
The S&P 500 was posting 85 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 89 new highs and 37 new lows.

Stocks climbed a bit Wednesday, with the Dow and S&P 500 notching all-time closing highs as economic reports showed steady growth on jobs and in other fronts.
The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 0.2% -- and therefore above its record close of the previous session. The S&P 500's 0.4% gain was enough to send that broader index past its previous record close set exactly one week ago.
After its gain of 33 points, the blue-chip Dow settled at its new high of 17,912.62. The S&P 500's new number to beat is 2074.33, an increase for the day of nearly 8 points.
Finishing 0.4% higher, the Nasdaq composite ended the day at 4774.47.
On Tuesday, the Dow hit a new all-time closing high of 17,879.55 – about 51 points above the prior record close set Friday.
Monthly Markets Checkup: 6 things for December
The private sector added 208,000 jobs in November , payroll processor ADP said Wednesday, as the labor market continued to defy mixed economic news.
Economists had estimated ADP would report 226,000 new private sector jobs, according to Action Economics' survey. They expect the Labor Department's closely watched survey on Friday to show 225,000 payroll gains by businesses, as well as federal, state and local governments.
Services firms expanded at a faster pace in November , a signal that overall economic growth should remain robust. The Institute for Supply Management says its services index rose to 59.3 last month, up from 57.1 in October.
Worker productivity increased in the July-September quarter at a slightly faster pace than previously estimated while labor costs declined for a second straight quarter. Productivity, the amount of output per hour of work, increased at an annual rate of 2.3% in the third quarter while labor costs fell at a rate of 1%, the Labor Department reported Wednesday.
European stocks ended mixed.
In Asia on Wednesday, Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.32% and Kong's Hang Seng index dropped 0.95%.
The Russian ruble has extended a week of decline, fueled by low oil prices and Western sanctions against Russia over its role in Ukraine's crisis.
The ruble traded 1.7% lower at 54.8 against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday morning, losing over 16% of its value in the past five trading days.

Santa Claus is not something you typically associate with the stock market. But the bearded fellow is one of the things on investors' minds as we head into December.
The month has several factors weighing in the stock market's favor. It is the second month in a historically strong period for stocks and the second-best month for Dow Jones industrial average the past half century.
It's also when what is known as the Santa Claus Rally takes place. This seven-session spurt that begins at the end of December has delivered gains every year since 2009.
Even though the market has already racked up an impressive performance in 2014 and is at record levels, odds are good for the rally to continue because the Federal Reserve isn't likely to change its easy money ways, at least not for a while.
If past patterns persist, home builders will be one of the best-performing industry sectors as 2014 closes out. Small-company stocks could prosper as investors try to get in ahead of the group's traditional January rally. Technology stocks, which often sputter about now, could buck that trend thanks to momentum in big names such as Apple and Facebook, and the lingering buzz from the successful initial public offerings of the likes of Alibaba and GoPro.
Exchange-traded funds that invest in retailers offer a way to play the most important shopping season of the year. But if you're thinking about buying a mutual fund this month, think again, because you will also get an unnecessary tax bill.
Here are six things investors need to know for December:
1. 'Tis the season for stocks. The Dow has gained 1.6% on average in December, posting gains nearly 70% of the time, says Bespoke Investment Group. The market has a strong tailwind.

If prices at the gas pump remain low and consumers stay in a buying mood around the all-important holiday shopping season, there's a strong chance Santa will deliver gains this month.

Unemployment and Layoffs
Companies warn of 1,500 job cuts in Illinois.
More than 200 employees of Banco Popular in Rosemont will lose their jobs at the end of the year as the bank closes its back-office operations after selling its branches to First Midwest Bancorp earlier this year.
Banco Popular disclosed the layoffs of 233 workers in a report filed with the Illinois Department of Labor last month.
The City Council on Tuesday approved Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s plan to boost Chicago’s minimum wage to $13 an hour by mid-2019, while efforts in Springfield to hike the state’s rate and apply some brakes to further city increases fizzled at least until January. ( Hal Dardick, Monique Garcia, Rick Pearson, Ray Long )
Banco Popular is the retail arm of Puerto Rico's largest bank, Popular Inc. Popular's North American headquarters has been in Rosemont for years. Banco Popular also agreed to sell its banking operations in Southern California and central Florida.
Four country clubs in the Chicago area also reported mass layoffs with the Labor Department. Royal Fox and Royal Hawk in St. Charles; Klein Creek in Winfield; and the Grove in Long Grove will let go a total of 288 workers Jan. 1.
The four clubs were operated by Atlanta-based Sequoia Golf, which was sold to Dallas-based ClubCorp in October. A ClubCorp spokeswoman did not have any immediate information about the layoffs. One of ClubCorp's properties is the Metropolitan Club in Willis Tower.
The Illinois Department of Labor reported that it received layoff notices that will affect more than 1,500 workers. The following layoffs also were reported last month:
•Continental Furniture is permanently laying off 63 workers starting next month at a Chicago facility.
•GE Zenith Controls will terminate 139 starting next month at a Chicago factory.
•UPS filed a notice involving 449 workers at its Addison facility. But a company spokesman said the workers will be offered jobs at four other Chicago-area UPS locations while the Addison facility is being renovated during the next two years.
•Rosewood Restaurant & Banquets in Rosemont will close at the end of year, affecting 104 workers.
•Sealy Mattress will terminate 174 employees at a factory in Batavia starting next month.
•Ceannate Corp. will close a collection agency in Rockford, affecting 130 workers Feb. 1.
•Benedictine University will lay off an undisclosed number of employees at its Springfield campus at the end of the year.
The Illinois Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act requires employers to provide 60 days' notice of pending plant closings  or mass layoffs. The law applies to businesses with at least 75 full-time employees. A "mass layoff" is defined as job cuts at a single site during any 30-day period of at least 33 percent of workers and at least 25 employees, or at least 250 employees regardless of the percentage.

New Delhi railway station to get Wi-fi fromThursdayPosted: December 3, 2014 8:47 pm
 
Come Thursday and passengers at New Delhi railway station would be able to access Wi-fi internet within its premises as the public transporter is kicking off a scheme for providing more connectivity at stations.
Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu will launch the Wi-fi facility at the busiest station in the country here with the project being implemented by RailTel, a railway PSU which is mandated to provide the service at major stations across the country.
Passengers on all 16 platforms at New Delhi railway station will be able to access the Wi-fi internet.
“We are providing the Wi-fi service as a value-added facility for passengers,” said a senior railway ministry official.
The Wi-fi facility shall be available free of cost for an initial period of 30 minutes and would require the people at the station to register for the same through their mobile phones.
For usage beyond 30 minutes, the user may purchase scratch cards which will be made available at 24X7 Wi-fi helpdesks on the concourse at the Paharganj and Ajmeri gate sides of New Delhi railway station.
“These cards are priced at Rs 25 for 30 minutes and Rs 35 for one hour and are valid through 24 hours,” said the official.
The total cost of the project is Rs 50 lakh and an amount of Rs 16 lakh will be spent annually to run the facility. The Wi-fi facility is to be provided at 75 major category stations within a year.
The facility is to be launched on a trial basis at Agra, Ahmedabad and Varanasi by the end of December and at Howrah, Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus and Secunderabad by January next year.
New Delhi station is the busiest station in the country with about 300 trains and close to 5 lakh passengers coming to its platforms daily.

Indian woman gangraped in Nepals GadhimaiFestivalBy: Press Trust of India | Kathmandu |
Posted: December 3, 2014 8:29 pm
A 20-year-old Indian woman, who was in Nepal to take part in the famous Gadhimai festival, was gangraped by seven men, police said on Wednesday.
The devotee, who hailed from Motihari in Bihar, reached Nepal’s southern Bara district to visit the religious site and was gangraped on Tuesday, according to Deputy Superintendent of Police of the district, Rabindra Regmi.
A gang of local men took her to a nearby lonely area in the premises of the temple and raped her on Tuesday afternoon, the police officer told PTI over phone.
A police team, who had been patrolling in the area, heard the victim’s screams for help.
The policemen immediately rescued the victim and nabbed all of the perpetrators, according to the officer, who said that legal action has been initiated against all the culprits.
The victim is kept under the protection of women and children service centre of the district police office where she was provided with necessary care, food and clothes, the police said.

CJI sets up Social Justice Bench for public interestcasesWritten by Utkarsh Anand | New Delhi |
Posted: December 4, 2014 12:03 am | Updated: December 4, 2014 1:09 pm
Resolute that people’s voices never go unheard before the highest court of the land, Chief Justice of India H L Dattu has set up a special bench, christened “Social Justice Bench”, to specifically deal with the issues troubling a common man in everyday life. This is the first time the Supreme Court will have a dedicated bench to hear cases pertaining to public interest and all fresh PILs may be heard by the new bench from now. Currently, such cases are scattered over different benches.
This is the first time the Supreme Court will have a dedicated bench to hear cases pertaining to public interest and all fresh PILs may be heard by the new bench from now. Currently, such cases are scattered over different benches.
Notifying the constitution of a two-judge bench on Wednesday, the CJI, through an official note, expressed concern over pendency of several cases in the Supreme Court without a proper hearing.
Cases that relate to problems in society and those which have a direct impact on the rights of the people are the areas where the constitutional mechanism has to play a proactive role so as to meet the goals of the Constitution, according to the note.
“Honb’le the Chief Justice of India is of the view that these cases shall be given a specialised approach for their early disposal so that the masses will realise the fruits of the rights provided to them by the constitutional text,” stated the note, adding the CJI’s order aimed at securing social justice — one of the ideals of the Constitution.
Secretary General VSR Avadhani told The Indian Express that the CJI has directed that the Social Justice Bench would start functioning from December 12. The new bench will devise a procedure to expeditiously deal with the issues and would continue to sit on every working Friday at 2 pm to monitor the implementation of its directions to authorities concerned.
Justice Madan B Lokur and Justice Uday U Lalit would comprise the bench, which will hear not only the pending cases but also all the fresh matters on the pertinent issues. Out of around 200 such cases pending in the court, 65 cases have been identified to begin with and the cases, already pending before other benches, may get transferred to the special bench on the directions of the CJI.
Release of surplus food grains for people affected by natural calamities after framing a comprehensive scheme for public distribution, rehabilitation of sex workers, prevention of untimely death of pregnant women and children due to malnourishment or lack of medical care, hygienic mid-day meal, shelter homes for the destitute and homeless and education for the children are illustrations of the kind of cases that the new bench would take up.

e-Visa facility to be implemented at 8 airpo...Arun Jaitley
(The e-Visa facility will…)
SRINAGAR: The e-Visa facility will be implemented at eight major airports of the country but will not be extended to the airports where security concerns are involved, Finance Minister ArunJaitley said today.
"Wherever there is security reason, there we will not do it but it will be implemented at all eight major eight airports of the country," he said at an interaction with civil society here.
Responding to questions, the Minister said the e-Visa facility, which was started for nationals of 32 countries, will be extended to more countries in future.
"We have started e-Visa where people get visa on the internet and the tourists will get information at the airport. They do not need to visit any Indian embassy . We are going to increase it to cover more countries," he said.
Jaitley said tourism is a big priority for the central goverment as it focusses on increasing the tourist arrivals in the country.
"Away from Kashmir, let us look at entire India. It has a long sea coast, largest peninsula. Mountains are there, resorts, religious tourism are there, cultural tourism is there. Only six to seven million tourists come to India.
"City states like Singapore, Honk Kong or Dubai city get 10 time more tourists. We are going to increase tourism across the country," he added.

60% of cuts in spendingDownload the reader here
Many analysts had been expecting the borrowing forecasts to rise by more because, as the chancellor conceded, "tax receipts have deteriorated" by more than the OBR had predicted.
Mr Osborne said the biggest factor keeping borrowing down was that the amount of interest being paid on the debt was lower than had been expected.
But there were stark warnings from the OBR in its report accompanying the Autumn Statement of the amount of spending cuts still to come from the government.
It said that the government's overall plan for spending on public services was to reduce it from £5,650 per head in 2009-10 to £3,880 per head in 2019-20.
The OBR warned that only about 40% of that cut would be made during the current Parliament, with the remaining 60% still to come in the next one.
"Total public spending is now projected to fall to 35.2% of GDP in 2019-20, taking it below the previous post-war lows reached in 1957-58 and 1999-00 to what would probably be its lowest level in 80 years."
The OBR also said: "Despite strong economic growth, the budget deficit is expected to fall by only £6.3bn this year to £91.3bn, around half the decline we expected in March.
"That would be the second smallest year-on-year reduction since its peak in 2009-10, despite this being the strongest year for GDP growth."
The government was still set to miss its target of having net debt fall as a share of GDP in 2015-16, the independent forecaster said. It expected net debt to rise by 0.8% of GDP in that year, when it will peak at 81.1%.
George Osborne MP: "The deficit is falling this year and every year"
In his response to the Autumn Statement, shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: "Over two years [Mr Osborne] has revised up borrowing by £12.5bn."
"This means the chancellor will have borrowed in this Parliament £219bn more than he planned in 2010."
Inflation forecast
The increase in the borrowing forecast had been expected because the government borrowed £64.1bn in the first seven months of the financial year, an increase of £3.7bn from the same period last year.
The forecast for borrowing next year has been raised from £68.7bn to £75.9bn, but the predictions for the years after that have improved.
The OBR expects inflation measured by the consumer prices index (CPI) of 1.5% this year, 1.2% next year and 1.7% the year after. It had previously said that CPI would only fall slightly below the Bank of England's forecast rate of 2.0% this year before returning to that level.
The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that the interest paid on government debt in the year to the end of October came in at £49.2bn, down from £50.4bn in the previous 12 months, despite rising debt.
Lower inflation forecasts also mean the government expects to have to make lower welfare payments and lower uprating on public sector pensions.
Some analysts had also suggested that the point at which the government finances moves into surplus could be delayed by a year, but in fact the surplus for 2018-19 has only been reduced from £5bn to £4bn, with a surplus of £23bn predicted for 2019-20.

reform of stamp dutyRobinson: A pre-election Budget?
George Osborne has said stamp duty will be cut for 98% of homebuyers in his Autumn Statement to the Commons.
The chancellor said that from midnight the current system, where the amount owed jumps at certain price levels, would be replaced by a graduated rate, working in a similar way to income tax.
He admitted borrowing would be higher than forecast but claimed the UK would be "into the black" by 2019/20.
Labour said his deficit reduction targets were "all in tatters".
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the headline announcements were "real electioneering" by the Conservative chancellor.
The new rates will apply in Scotland until 1 April next year, when the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax replaces stamp duty there.
The Autumn Statement - which was called the pre-Budget report under the previous Labour government - is a chance to flag future tax and spending plans as well as set out the state of the nation's finances.
In other measures:
A 25% "diverted profits" tax - often called a "Google tax" - would be aimed at multinational companies
Air Passenger Duty for children under 12 would be abolished next year, and under-16s from the following year
Bank profits which can be offset by losses for tax purposes would be limited to 50%
An extra £2bn would be put into health services across the UK
VAT for hospices and air ambulances would be refunded
The UK would play a "lead role" in a European mission to Mars
Investment in businesses, academies, research and culture to create a "northern powerhouse" in England
There would be a review of business rates to help High Street stores take on internet firms
People will be able to pass on their tax-free ISA allowances to spouses when they die
There would be a new £90,000 charge for people who are non-domiciled in the UK for tax purposes but have lived there for 17 of the past 20 years
The higher rate income tax threshold would rise to £42,385 next year
In its report accompanying the statement, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said the government's overall plan was to reduce public spending from £5,650 per head in 2009-10 to £3,880 in 2019-20.
Some 60% of this reduction was still to come in the next parliament, it said.
OBR chairman Robert Chote predicted a "very sharp squeeze" on public service spending in the next parliament based on the figures available.
The new stamp duty rates at different band levels will only apply to the part of the property price that falls within that band, so there will no longer be a huge jump in stamp duty, for instance, on a property costing £500,001.
Under the new rules, no tax will be paid on the first £125,000 of a property, followed by 2% on the portion up to £250,000, 5% on the portion between £250,000 and £925,000, 10% on the next bit up to £1.5 million and 12% on everything over that.
People currently in the process of purchasing a home could choose which regime to operate under, Mr Osborne said.
The Treasury said someone buying a property at the average family home price of £275,000 would save £4,500, while a £2.1m purchase would carry £18,750 more stamp duty compared with the old system.
Mr Chote said the reform could put up house prices in some areas, predicting prices would rise where the tax had fallen, and fall where it had risen.
Mr Osborne said the tax cut, which is UK-wide until April when stamp duty is devolved to Scotland, was worth £800m a year.
Analysis: By Nick Robinson, BBC political editor
In all but name this was a pre-election Budget.
From his first to his last sentence - from boasting about Britain's growth to unveiling the Coalition's version of the mansion tax - Chancellor George Osborne delivered his Autumn Statement with not just one eye but both fixed firmly on polling day.
In quotes: A round-up of reaction to the Autumn Statement
Earlier, MPs were told UK growth was set to be 3% this year, higher than Germany, but falling to 2.3% by 2019.
The chancellor said the measures he was announcing in the statement were "not a giveaway", saying overall they would tighten the public finances but warning "substantial savings" in public spending were still needed.
Mr Osborne said the government had inherited an economy "on the brink" but said the deficit was half what the government had taken on.
Government borrowing is forecast at £91.3bn this year, then £75.9bn, MPs were told. In March the forecast for this year was for borrowing of almost £87bn.
"The deficit is falling this year and every year," Mr Osborne said, although he added that "warning lights are flashing over the global economy".
Ed Balls MP: "Every target missed, every test failed, every promise broken"
Labour said the chancellor had failed to keep his 2010 general election promise to balance the books.
Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said the increase in borrowing was in "black and white, hard evidence", saying Mr Osborne had questions to answer about living standards, wages and tax receipts.
He said: "People are worse off and the fact is he has failed to balance the books in this parliament".
Only Labour could "balance the books in a fair way", he added.

Lib Dem Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg was absent from the Commons for the Autumn Statement, as he was on a regional visit to Cornwall.
Sources close to Mr Clegg have dismissed suggestions he missed it because he no longer wants to be seen sitting next to David Cameron or George Osborne in Parliament.
A Lib Dem Treasury source said it was "nonsense", saying the deputy prime minister was "out in the country, meeting people who will benefit from the Autumn Statement".
'A different view'
Although the measures announced in the Autumn Statement are coalition government policy, it emerged that Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable had written to the OBR expressing "growing concern" that the difference between forecasts based on coalition policies and projections for future years - where spending decisions had not yet been made - was not being made clear.
In its response to the letter, the OBR said the distinction was made "very clear", saying it based its forecasts on current government policy.
Speaking to Sky News, Mr Cable said he had no reservations about the Autumn Statement but emphasised that the Lib Dems had a "different approach" from that of their Conservative coalition colleagues on how to proceed with deficit reduction in the next parliament.
"They are making claims about tax cuts we have said are simply not realisable. There will be an argument about the different mix of public spending and taxation," he said.
He added: "It's very difficult to see how the Conservatives can achieve their objectives of protecting those core services and their policies on tax. They don't add up, there is a different view and we should be expressing it."
The Lib Dem business secretary has told his officials not to engage "at this stage in rounds of negotiation on public spending cuts which are the proper responsibility of the next government".
Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander told the BBC's Daily Politics borrowing was falling "less fast than expected in March", putting this down to "weaker than expected tax receipts".
However, he said the UK was doing "far, far better" than almost any other major economy.
The Institute of Directors said it was a "disciplined, long-term" statement from Mr Osborne, while the CBI said "real challenges" lay ahead to reduce public spending.
UKIP economic spokesman Patrick O'Flynn said: "The brutal truth is that the government has comprehensively failed in its central mission to wipe out the deficit."
Green Party leader Natalie Bennett said Mr Osborne was "continuing the demonstrably false claim that our deficit problems can be blamed on government spending and welfare".

The Scottish National Party's deputy leader Stewart Hosie said the statement was the "continuation of a failed austerity programme", adding: "We saw today the consequences of London taking economic decisions for Scotland."
Plaid Cymru's Treasury spokesperson, Jonathan Edwards, welcomed agreement to devolve control over business rates to the Welsh government, but said there was "little here on offer to our nation".

Arby s Makes Entire Ad Apologizing to PepsiArby's makes entire ad apologizing to Pepsi
Ben Popken TODAY
Email
Arby's is back at it with another pitch-perfect marketing stunt: an ad saying "sorry" to Pepsi.
According to the ad copy and a WSJ report , Arby's has an agreement to feature Pepsi in at least two ads per year. But this year, so focused on releasing ads with lingering shots of its meat , Arby's forgot to talk about what you wash them down with.
Pepsi sent Arby's a note in October reminding it of the promise and the fast sandwich chain came back with a doozy. It's 30 seconds of a single shot of a glass of iced Pepsi. The voiceover by Ving Rhames spends most of the time talking about how Arby's forgot to include Pepsi and how this is their makeup video.
"Arby's has an agreement to feature their good friend Pepsi in two commercials a year," says Rhames in the ad. "Well, Arby's messed up and forgot about the second commercial! So here it is. Pepsiiiiii... cool... refreshing... and goes great with Arby's sandwiches... and other Arby's foods... Arby's! We have Pepsi!"
Truth in advertising just hit a new benchmark.

Wait 1 second to continue.
Garner, 43, died July 17 after Officer Daniel Pantaleo placed him in what appeared to be a chokehold during an arrest that was recorded on videos, which have contributed to public anger over the treatment of African American men by police.
Garner’s mother, Gwen Carr, expressed outrage at the decision. “I don’t know what video they were looking at, not the same one as the rest of the world,” Carr said at a press conference. “How could we put our trust in the justice system when they fail us like this?”
Eric Garner’s widow, Esaw, said on MSNBC that “it was like a modern-day lynching. They had it out for him.”
Carr welcomed the federal investigation and called for nonviolence. “Yes, we want you to rally, but do it in peace. Make a statement, but make it in peace.” Rev. Al Sharpton called for a national march next week in Washington, D.C., as a response to the Garner and Brown cases.
Pantaleo commented on the decision in a statement released through the NYC Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association. “I became a police officer to help people and to protect those who can’t protect themselves,” he said. “It is never my intention to harm anyone and I feel very bad about the death of Mr. Garner. My family and I include him and his family in our prayers and I hope that they will accept my personal condolences for their loss.”
When asked at a press conference about whether she accepted Pantaleo’s apology, Esaw Garner flatly declared: “Hell no.”
“The time for remorse would have been when my husband was yelling to breathe. That would have been the time for him to show some type of remorse or some type of care for another human being’s life—when he was screaming 11 times that he can’t breathe,” Esaw Garner said.  “There’s nothing that him or his prayers or anything else will make me feel any different. No, I don’t accept his apology. No, I can care less about his condolences. He’s still working, still getting a paycheck, still feeding is kids when my husband is six feet under and I’m looking for a way to feed my kids now.”
The NYPD bans the use of the chokehold; Pantaleo’s attorney, Stuart London, argued that the officer used an approved take-down move, which he learned in police academy, because Garner was resisting arrest.  “There was no pressure ever applied to his throat or neck area,” London said.
Staten Island residents were shocked and saddened by the news that a grand jury will not indict an NYPD officer in the chokehold death of Eric Garner. (AP)
The New York City medical examiner’s office has  classified Garner’s death  as homicide due to “compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police.” The office also mentioned Garner’s asthma and hypertensive cardiovascular disease as contributing factors.
London said Pantaleo remains on modified assignment on Staten Island.
Holder said the majority of officers perform “honorably” and “it’s for their sake as well that we must seek to heal the breakdown in trust.” U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch, who has been nominated to succeed Holder as attorney general, had been monitoring the case prior to Holder’s announcement, an official said.
The federal probe will include a review of the materials gathered during the local grand jury investigation.
After a meeting with officials, clergy and activists on Staten Island, de Blasio called for peaceful demonstrations. “It’s a very emotional day for our city. It’s a very painful day for so many New Yorkers — that is a core reality,” the mayor said. “We’re grieving again over the loss of Eric Garner.”
The NYPD will conduct an internal investigation, de Blasio said. Earlier Wednesday, New York’s two U.S. senators, Charles Schumer (D) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D), had said they would urge the Justice Department to investigate.
Protests had been planned in advance of the grand jury decision. Shortly after several outlets reported that the grand jury declined to indict, activists on Twitter quickly spread the word about protests set to take place late Wednesday afternoon and into the evening, including at Times Square.
New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) also called for peaceful protests, saying in a statement: “While there will be people who disagree with today’s grand jury decision, it is important that we respect the legal process and rule of law.”
A pair of widely circulated videos emerged this summer showing the circumstances of Garner’s death. In the first, obtained by the New York Daily News, Garner is approached by officers apparently because he was selling loose cigarettes. After a confrontation, one officer places Garner in what looks very much like a chokehold. The man, who was asthmatic, then repeatedly tells the officer that he cannot breathe.
A second video shows Garner lying motionless on the ground for several minutes as officers wait for emergency personnel.
[ Watch the video of the police arrest of Garner here ]
Other officers present on July 17 were not facing indictment as they were offered immunity  in exchange for testimony.
Authorities may make public evidence considered by the grand jury. Richmond County District Attorney Daniel M. Donovan Jr. is seeking a court order that would allow him to release “specific information in connection with this grand jury investigation,” a statement read.
According to Donovan’s office, “over 38 interviews were conducted, yielding 22 civilian witnesses who reported to have seen some part of the interaction between Eric Garner and members of the NYPD.”
Donovan impaneled the 23-member grand jury this summer to determine whether Pantaleo would face charges. Donovan had not commented on which charges the grand jury considered. Before the decision, legal experts told the New York Times that the grand jury might consider lesser homicide charges, including second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide.
Garner died weeks before Darren Wilson fatally shot Brown in Ferguson, Mo., in early August. In the Missouri case, a grand jury declined to indict Wilson just before Thanksgiving, prompting large, widespread and sometimes chaotic protests, including in New York.
In Ferguson, a section of an outraged crowd followed the grand jury decision with a night of mayhem , damaging two police cars and burning several local businesses to the ground. In a Times Square protest against the Wilson grand jury decision last week, Police Commissioner Bill Bratton was sprayed with a substance resembling blood .
This week, Garner’s family — along with the NYPD, civil rights groups and city officials — expressed hope that demonstrators would greet the decision peacefully. Protesters prepared to assemble ahead of the grand jury decision, Reuters reported .
[RELATED:  ‘I can’t breathe’: After indictment decision, Eric Garner’s final words become a symbol of anger, frustration ]
The city had been preparing for the decision, and any protests or demonstrations it might bring. In a Tuesday news conference , de Blasio said that “the police will act very assertively” if law enforcement officials believe that demonstrations begin to compromise public safety.
Bratton, speaking at the same news conference, said this concerning potential protesters : “Will they engage in some type of demonstration no matter which way the jury goes? Certainly. But I think that there will be an ability — that people will get to have their voices heard without disturbances.”
Likewise, Garner’s 18-year-old son, Eric Snipes, had told the New York Daily News that any response to the grand jury decision in New York is “not going to be a Ferguson-like protest because I think everybody knows my father wasn’t a violent man, and they’re going to respect his memory by remaining peaceful.” He added: “It’s not going to be like it was there.”

A unified 20-year history of the radically changing way we relate to the WebBy Doug Belshaw December 3
A still from a 1994 film about the Internet (YouTube)
Over the past 20+ years, our understanding of what the Web is and how it impacts society has developed. So, I would argue, has our understanding of Web literacy.
By “Web literacy” I mean the skills and competencies that are required to read, write and participate on the open Web. It’s worth noting that “reading” and “writing” should be understood broadly to include multimedia and not just the written word. My focus here isn’t the history of the Web itself, but the history of the skills that people have thought necessary to use it. It’s a subtle, but important distinction.
Not everyone uses the term “Web literacy” when referring to the skills required to read, write and participate on the Web. Many researchers, especially during the 1990s, preferred the term “information literacy.” Even today, there are overlapping terms (such as “media literacy” and “digital literacy”) used to describe similar areas. Proponents of each tend to advocate their favored term as a container for the others. My intention is not to do this with Web literacy, but to carve it out as something increasingly distinct from the kinds of literacies that have been identified before.
While somewhat arbitrary, I’ve divided the history of Web literacy into four eras plus the one in which we currently find ourselves. I’ve started from 1993 as this marked the year when graphical Web browsers such as Mosaic could browse a decent number of Web sites.
1993-1997: The Information Superhighway
2003-2007: The Web 2.0 era
2008-2012: The Era of the App
2013+: The Post-Snowden era
It’s worth noting that what follows is partial, incomplete, focused on the developed, western world, and only a first attempt. I’d be very grateful for comment, pushback, and pointers to other work in this area.
1993-1997: The Information Superhighway
The Web was new in the 1990s, and a great deal of early research into Web literacy was upon the ways in which it could be considered different from what had gone before. Although there was an awareness that the Web potentially allowed anyone to be a producer as well as a consumer, the focus was very much on “reading” rather than “writing.” The organizing metaphors were of users accessing the world’s biggest “library,” navigating an “information superhighway” (to use Al Gore’s famous expression) or “surfing” a huge wave of information.
There was a sense at this time that humanity stood on the edge of a radical new way of connecting and organizing society. Lots of people got excited about hypertext. Researchers and thinkers discussed how access to linked knowledge could lead to massive changes; here, for instance, is the literacy researcher Bertram C. Bruce in 1997:
“The literacy practices one can engage in are to a large extent a function of the available technologies and not a property of the individual. The power of digital technologies to make possible new forms of literate practices thus leads us naturally to a transformative stance on technology. Instead of just asking, will there be equity or inequity as a result of new technologies, we might start instead with, ‘What sort of society do we want?’ With this frame, we see that if rich schools get all the new computers, it is not that things just happened to work out that way, but rather that we as a society chose to selectively empower one group at the expense of another through technology. New technologies make it easier to carry out society’s agenda; the key issue is what that agenda should be.”
Web literacy at this point in time was understood mainly in terms of understanding how to get access to the Web, and then being able to navigate hypertext. In other words, Web literacy was about procedural skills. Researchers experimented with non-linear research papers, narratives, and approaches. Bulletin Board Systems (BBS), perhaps one of the earliest examples of user-generated content, developed into Web forums.
As Wendy Hall and Thanassis Tiropanis pointed out in 2012, “for the general user, the Web was experienced as a single system that could be accessed using a personal computer, and which was primarily a source of information and news.” While this is still true of many people today, there were technical and financial barriers for people wanting to write and/or participate on the Web.
1998-2002: The Wild West
The year 1998 marked, in Britain at least, when anyone who wanted to could get online relatively easily. Alongside existing subscription services such as CompuServe and AOL came pay-as-you go services from the likes of Freeserve. Along with their connection, Internet Service Providers or ISPs gave users a small amount of Web space. Just as academics who were given space on university servers could publish to the Web, so anyone who could use a tool such as Macromedia Dreamweaver or Netscape Composer, could do likewise.

The Web itself continued to be understood through the lens of traditional print media. This was a time of the so-called “browser wars” where users would be told that a particular Web site was “best viewed using Netscape Navigator” at a particular resolution. Indeed, the amount of technical knowledge required when building a Web site meant most users remained “readers” rather than “writers” of the Web. Participation was mainly through “Web rings” such as Bomis (if you had your own Web site) and Web forums.
Over the period of just a few short years, a great deal of money was invested in Web-based start-ups as part of the “dot-com boom.” Every major company began to have a Web presence and there was much talk in the media about online shopping and about the security of transactions. This also was the time of great (unfounded) fears around the havoc the “Millennium Bug” would wreak as clocks flipped from 1999 to 2000.
In this era, the Web was seen as a slightly dangerous new frontier. The metaphor that was often used was that of the “wild west.” It was unknown, there were no gatekeepers, and doing anything more than consuming the Web required skills in short supply. One of the most visible ways the Web seemed “wild” was the a lack of standardization. We’ve since come to take for granted what one researcher, John McEneaney, complained about in the year 2000:
[W]e don’t yet quite know all the ins and outs of ‘Web literacy,’ and compounding the problem is the fact that the new technologies preserve much of the capabilities of the old ways while introducing new elements. The result is increased opportunities for complexity and as we increase complexity, we increase demands on those who seek to use the materials we produce.
The Web was familiar, yet alien. Reading on it was somehow different; writing was reserved for those with technical skills; and, while instant messaging was popular, participation on the Web was primarily through clunky, slow forum software. The skills required to use the Web at this point were ill-defined. But, more than that, the Web and the skills required to use it were seen as optional extras to “real life.”
2003-2007: The Web 2.0 Era
After the dot-com boom and bust, some predicted that that Web was a fad and had had its day. What happened instead was the birth of a new era, popularized by Tim O’Reilly in 2004 as “Web 2.0.” This signaled a shift in emphasis from users as consumers to users as (co-)producers. Blogs, wikis and podcasts were made possible by technologies and approaches such as JavaScript and AJAX. Users could “write” the Web in the browser itself, rather than using separate tools that required additional technical knowledge.
This was a time when the 2001 article by Marc Prensky — cited by Hall and Tiropanis above — was used extensively by the press. Labeling some people as “digital natives” and others as “digital immigrants,” the argument was that because young people were growing up with the Web and other digital technologies, they automatically became adept at using them. Despite a number of number of articles rebutting Prensky (see “ the ‘digital natives’ debate “), this view remains endemic in the wider population of Web users.
It was during the Web 2.0 era, write Joahanna Ahtikari and Sanna Ernonen, that the Web moved from being a “nice to have” to essential in the personal and professional lives of most people in the western world:
If we understand Web literacy as a social practice, it also follows that it is historically situated and constantly changing…. At least in many western societies, the Web is an influential medium causing changes in literacy practices of working, public and private lives. The Web functions as a new source of information demanding new strategies of handling this information, as well as brings along new ways of communicating. Reading and writing related to work and personal lives is ever more often connected to using the Web, and Web literacy practices have become an integral part of society functions.
Social networks such as Friendster, MySpace, Bebo and then Facebook shifted participation away from the “traditional” forum/BBS model. In addition, video-sharing Web sites such as Vimeo and YouTube allowed Web users to communicate using multimedia. Reading, writing and participating on the Web became easier, lowering the barrier to entry. The Web became integrated with everyday life, meaning that, per Colin Lankshear and Michele Knobel’s 2007 “Literacies Sampler,” all of the following were recognized as literacies:
… blogging, fanfic writing, manga producing, meme-ing, photoshopping, anime music video (AMV) practices, podcasting, vodcasting, and gaming are literacies, along with letter writing, keeping a diary, maintaining records, running a paper-based zine, reading literary novels and wordless picture books, reading graphic novels and comics, note-making during conference presentations or lectures, and reading bus timetables.
Services were often free, looking to grow their user base in search of funding. This meant Web users regularly explored new services, and there were many and diverse ways to achieve the same outcome. The Web was interoperable through technologies such as RSS and RDF. This meant there was a low cost of switching services for those who wished to do so.
2008-2012: The Era of the App
During the Era of the App, it became increasingly controversial to point to a dichotomy between “real life” and the virtual world. Online, digital life and offline, analogue life was blended. One of the reasons for this was the growth in online access through smartphones and tablets. Although smart devices such as Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) were available earlier, smartphones changed the way that people interacted with the Web. Instead of having to go to a particular place to do something online, we now had a search engine in our pocket.

People began to take it for granted that they had a camera on them at all times that could instantly send images and videos anywhere in the world. It was commonplace to search a person’s name to see what came up on the Web before meeting them for a job interview or a date. We could join in with multiple global conversations through the use of hashtags. As the developed world had near ubiquitous broadband connections in densely populated areas, we began consuming media by streaming instead of sharing physical media.
Native apps on smart devices started to augment existing services, and then became the primary way people accessed them. Indeed, some social networks, such as Instagram, have only recently added a Web presence accessible via a browser. Most of the remaining complexity of the Web was removed for users through apps. This often came through apps having a single purpose — making them simpler to use, but blocking users’ view of the Web. The cost of simplicity was silos.
The baseline level of Web literacy demanded by society shifted during this era from understanding how to “read” the Web, to at least also being able to “write” it. However, the shift away from the open Web (even if Web technologies such as HTTP were being used) came at a price. It was at the expense of users owning their own data and understanding the infrastructure behind what came to be called “the Cloud.” The seemingly-public spaces in which our reading and writing of the Web takes place became increasingly privately owned.
An important aspect of Web literacy in this era was about appropriating the privately-owned tools to stand out from the crowd and form an individual identity. Being on the Web was no longer seen as different in and of itself. Researcher Rafi Santo has coined the term “hacker literacies” which many might see as falling under the aegis of Web literacy in this respect:
I define hacker literacies as empowered participatory practices, grounded in critical mindsets, that aim to resist, reconfigure, and/or reformulate the sociotechnical digital spaces and tools that mediate social, cultural, and political participation. These ‘critical mindsets’ include perceiving how values are at play in the design of these spaces and tools; understanding how those designs affect the behaviors of users of those spaces and tools; and developing empowered outlooks, ones that assume change is possible, in relation to those designs and rooted in an understanding of their malleability.
This was a time when a majority of people in western societies were using the Web. They still believed “use” led to proficiency, meaning Web literacy skills were not taught systematically. Reading and writing the Web was seen to be as simple as opening an easy-to-use app. Participating was getting involved in social networks. “Web literacy” was seen as something learned by osmosis rather than needing to be systematically taught.
2013+: The Post-Snowden Era
In mid-2013, the Snowden revelations lifted the veil on our understanding of the shiny, easy-to-use landscape of smart devices and apps. We collectively realized that we didn’t understand what was going on underneath the surface. We were shocked to discover who had access to our data. We started to worry more about how to manage our increasingly-important online identity and reputation.

More people started to realize the answers to questions they’d wondered about (such as: how come most apps and Web services are free?) had dark and scary answers. We found out that, along with untold benefits, our use of apps and the Web has a dark underbelly of corporate and government surveillance. Mozilla’s Executive Director Mark Surman believes this era could last for a while:
We’re at the beginning of this era of the Internet and its going to last at least to the end of this century. We’re really figuring out the infrastructure; the legal structure and the social norms for choosing how and when to be private which is just a normal part of human society.
We’re at an interesting juncture in the history of Web literacy. There are those coming to the Web for the first time and who need to learn how to read and write it. However, instead of this being on the open Web that many of us experienced, their welcome is from companies providing things for free in return for building up a comprehensive and privacy-invading advertising profile. Their “participation” will be tracked as ours is.
Thankfully, there is a growing realization that Web literacy is not something that necessarily comes naturally. People are not “digital natives” and literacy is something that needs to be continually worked at. Web literacy is like traditional literacy practices — we evolve as they evolve, and vice versa.
My hope is that in this new fifth era, we understand the Web for what it is, a platform for human flourishing. Perhaps we will learn to teach current and next generations how to read, write and participate, effectively using it.

Source: Cubs remove 1 sign  shrink another in revised Wrigley plan11
Specifically, the agency was concerned that the two video screens and five signs would take the focus away from the historic centerfield scoreboard and recommended the team reduce the number of signs, said Park Service spokeswoman Kathy Kupper.
In addition to removing a script sign in left field, the Cubs made several other concessions to receive the Park Service's approval of the signage, according to an agreement the agency provided the Tribune on Wednesday.
The proposed right-field video screen will shrink to 2,200 square feet from 2,400 square feet. It will also be moved closer to the foul line where the bleachers are not as tall. The new location allows the video screen to be set lower. A script sign that the Cubs planned to put in the same location will be moved closer to the centerfield scoreboard.
The Park Service also had concerns about the number of video screens in the ballpark. In light of the second video board in the outfield, the agency asked the Cubs to modify the LED video ribbon board planned for the fascia of the upper deck grandstand.
The agreement appears unclear on the future of those ribbon boards. Kupper said the Cubs would eliminate them entirely and replace them with billboards. However, Green said the Cubs have agreed only to reduce the length of ribbon board with the exact length to be determined.
If the Cubs eliminate one or more of the proposed outfield signs, the agency will reconsider the team's request for the ribbon boards, Kupper said.
In seeking the tax incentives, the Cubs are required to gain approval of the entire project from the Park Service, which determines whether the renovation of historic properties meets the Department of Interior's standards and is thus eligible for tax credits.
The federal government has promoted the tax breaks as a way to preserve historic commercial properties and encourage their contemporary use. The tax breaks are credited with saving Fenway Park in Boston, the oldest baseball stadium in the major leagues.
Once the Park Service determines that a project is eligible for credits, preservationists said, it typically takes an ongoing regulatory role, lending an additional layer of evaluation to the redevelopment of historic properties.
The Park Service reviewed about 40 amendments for the Fenway Park proposal, Kupper said.
"This is very standard, does not raise my eyebrows whatsoever," said McDonald, of Landmarks Illinois.
A key difference between the federal and local review processes is that Park Service officials may be less subject to political pressure than members of a local landmarks commission appointed by the mayor.
McDonald added: "I think (Park Service officials) have a different mentality in mind. They recognize that they are guardians for the taxpayers funding the preservation program in our nation."

Emanuel plan to raise Chicago minimum wage to $13 sails through City Council
Dissenters warn of economic fallout as council votes to raise Chicago minimum wage to $13
Most Chicago aldermen vote to raise minimum wage to $13 an hour by 2019
The City Council on Tuesday approved Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s plan to boost Chicago’s minimum wage to $13 an hour by mid-2019, while efforts in Springfield to hike the state’s rate and apply some brakes to further city increases fizzled at least until January.
In an overwhelming 44-5 vote steeped in aldermanic and mayoral re-election politics, Emanuel and supportive council members sought to frame their move as a way to lift out of poverty children in thousands of families, many led by single mothers.
“The minimum wage is speaking to making sure that nobody who works raises a child in poverty,” Emanuel said. “The minimum wage…really comes down to making sure that your child does not go to school on an empty stomach (or) making sure that you don’t pick between medicine or school supplies.”

Addressing the council after the vote, Emanuel at times appeared to be delivering a re-election speech. He called the minimum wage only part of his comprehensive economic strategy that includes education, affordable health care and opportunities for people to learn skills to put them on a career path at a well-paying job.
At one point, while boasting that business interest in Chicago remains strong, the mayor went so far to say that the city was tops in gaining foreign investment and corporate relocations and has the No. 1 “Little League team” — a reference to the national champion Jackie Robinson West squad.
At the same time, Emanuel sought to discount his re-election bid in pushing the politically popular wage hike issue, saying if it was only about elections, the rate would increase during each campaign season.

“They’re going to make the decision based on a whole series of things,” Emanuel said of voters in the Feb. 24 election. “They’re going to make a decision on the fact that are we doing the things necessary to grow the economy, create jobs, create also the quality of life we want to see in every neighborhood of the city of Chicago. They’ll evaluate that.”
But Cook County Commissioner Jesus “Chuy” Garcia, a mayoral challenger, contended politics was the motive behind Emanuel’s effort to prod the council to act.
“For a mayor who is fond of saying he makes tough decisions, I think we have a right to ask why he did not make an easy one. Why didn't he support a minimum wage hike during his first year in office,” Garcia asked in a statement. Garcia promised to boost the wage to $15 an hour if he is elected.
Ald. Robert Fioretti, 2nd, another mayoral challenger, voted for the Emanuel plan but raised similar questions.
“Emanuel could’ve pushed this legislation earlier, and he could’ve pushed for $15 an hour today,” Fioretti said, adding, “I will continue to fight until Chicago workers get the living wages they deserve.”
Alds. Matthew O’Shea, 19th; Mary O’Connor, 41st; Brendan Reilly, 42nd; Michele Smith, 43rd; and Tom Tunney, 44th, voted against the measure, saying they believed a higher wage could damage business profits, raise unemployment and put a dent in city tax revenues.
O’Connor, who owns a deli and catering business, noted her Northwest Side ward borders several suburbs.
“Businesses in wards like mine will look to relocate elsewhere, like one block down the street in many instances. That means more vacant storefronts, less revenue for the city and more than likely a permanent freeze on our expansion plans,” she said.

Under the new ordinance, Chicago’s minimum-wage workers will see their first increase next July, when the rate increases to $10 an hour from the current statewide hourly rate of $8.25.
It then will increase by 50 cents in July 2016 and another 50 cents in July 2017. After that, the minimum wage would go up $1 in July 2018 and $1 in July 2019 to reach $13 an hour. After 2019, yearly increases would be pegged to the local consumer price index, with a limit of 2.5 percent, if the unemployment rate stays below 8.5 percent.
In Springfield, state Sen. Kim Lightford was working with powerful Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan on a plan that would block any future increases in the city’s wage rate after the $13-an-hour level is reached. But late Tuesday, Madigan pulled the plug on a statewide minimum wage hike bill until at least early January, with a spokesman citing “complications.”
“What (Madigan) told the caucus was that he’s going to continue to work to raise the minimum wage, but the complications of the last few days, few weeks, has made it difficult to find 60 votes in the House,” said Steve Brown, a spokesman for the speaker. “So we’ll just continue to work on it.”
Earlier, Lightford said the idea was to raise the statewide minimum wage from $8.25 to $9 an hour on July 1, then increase it by 50 cents an hour each year until it reached $11 an hour in 2019.
The Democratic senator from Maywood said the state measure also would have included tax credits to benefit restaurants and retailers, who have opposed the wage hikes.
“This bill would do a little bit of what the House wants and little bit of what we want,” Lightford said. “It’s taking into consideration everybody. It’s one of those that nobody loves, but how can you hate it, right? Because everybody gets some of their concerns addressed.”
Brown did not rule out lame-duck lawmakers taking up the minimum wage issue before the new General Assembly takes office in January. Brown also said a statewide minimum wage increase could come up in the spring during the next sesssion, when Republican Gov.-elect Bruce Rauner is in power.
For his part, Rauner voiced his concerns over the city’s actions and its affect on Chicago’s “competitiveness.”
Rauner, who stumbled over the minimum wage issue during his GOP primary campaign, restated his support for an increase in the state rate but only if it was coupled with unspecified pro-business changes in workers’ compensation, lawsuit damage awards and business taxes.
“Raising the minimum wage doesn’t help somebody (who is) unemployed, and it doesn’t help somebody who’s employed today and could get unemployed because of the lack of competitiveness that raising the minimum wage could engender,” Rauner told reporters at the Capitol.

A man who holds his own: Meet Anil Kumar Sinha  the new CBI directorNewsmaker: Anil Kumar Sinha
Aditi Phadnis | New Delhi Dec 04, 2014 09:04 PM IST
For civil servants in Bihar, 2006 and 2007 were golden years. Nitish Kumar had been installed as chief minister in 2005, and he was determined to get the bureaucracy to become a political force multiplier and get it to — well, just do its job. Anil Kumar Sinha, then additional director general of police, headquarters, was among those chosen by Kumar to help him in this endeavour.  
Soon after, Kumar wanted an FIR filed against a legislator from his own Janata Dal (United). Anant Singh, MLA from Mokama, had been trying to get owners of shops on Patna’s posh Fraser Road to vacate their premises; the original owner of the plot and his wife had both died without heirs and Singh thought this was a good time to take over. He advised shop owners to sell their plots to him in their own interest. The gunmen just stood by while he spoke, guns hanging loosely on their sides.
It fell on Sinha to motivate, threaten and persuade policemen at the Kotwali police station to file the complaint against Singh. Those who know Bihar politics and society alone can appreciate that this was easier said than done. Sinha got an FIR registered, but the policemen would reach Singh’s house in Patna, find him absent, paste a notice on the gate and return. Singh couldn’t be found by the police, although reporters located him without difficulty and he addressed press conferences freely! Speaking to Business Standard in 2007, Sinha pledged he would get the job done. And indeed, a case was filed against Singh. It was a sign that the man who has just been appointed director of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) meant business.
The legislator’s arrest was just one of the thousands that Sinha effected in Bihar. In 2006, with PK Sahi, then the advocate general of the state, he invoked the provision of the Arms Act that required only the testimony of police sub-inspector to arrest goondas and rid the state of its gun culture. He also reopened the probe into the 1989 Bhagalpur riots, in which more than 2,000 people had died, and build strong cases against many of the accused who had been let off.
After moving to the vigilance department, he took up the fight against officials whose assets were found to be disproportionate to their income. It was Sinha’s idea to set up special courts to try corrupt officials. The most significant aspect of the special courts was that the immovable assets of persons being tried in these courts could be seized during the pendency of the trial.
The Special Court Bill was passed by the state Assembly in March 2009. The President gave her assent to the Bill in January 2010. In 2010, the home of one of the officials found to have assets disproportionate to his income was seized by the state government and turned into a school. Kumar won the 2010 Assembly elections on the back of this legislation.
But as is inevitable in Bihar, caste politics intervened. Sinha left Patna to join the Central Vigilance Commission and then CBI as Ranjit Sinha’s second in command.
Sinha’s greatest quality as he takes up command of CBI is that he fears no one but the Constitution and the law and brings with him an earthy dedication to the job. Hopefully, this will let in some light into the dark corners of India’s premier investigation agency.

AIMA affiliate suggests private distribution of power in UPAIMA affiliate suggests private distribution of power in UP
Virendra Singh Rawat | Lucknow Dec 03, 2014 09:38 PM IST
A professionals’ body on Wednesday suggested handing over power distribution in urban areas to the private sector for energy conservation and cutting costs.
Lucknow Management Association (LMA), an affiliate of the All India Management Association (AIMA), said much of the power crisis in Uttar Pradesh was attributed to power pilferage emerging from power transmission glitches, poor distribution and theft, rather than just power-generation shortage.
“Private power distribution companies have introduced modern technology in several cities that has negated possibilities of power theft and pilferage. The same model could be adopted in Uttar Pradesh,” LMA Secretary A K Mathur said here. The decision of the state government to hand over power distribution to private companies has so far met with little success, especially due to stiff opposition from state energy department employees.
Meanwhile, LMA is organising its annual convention on driving UP’s growth through power sector in Lucknow on Friday to brainstorm on vital energy issues in the state, which faces perennial crisis due to the widening demand-supply gap.  The state falls short of about 3,000 megawatt (Mw) during peak hours.
People scheduled to speak at the session included Central Electricity Regulatory Commission Chairman Gireesh Pradhan, Association of Power Producers Director General Ashok Khurana, BHEL Chief Managing Director B P Rao, Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) Director General Ajay Mathur.
Of late, the power issue has been a major bone of contention between the Centre and the state government with each side blaming each other.

Harkin: We should have done single payer health reformBy Jose A. DelReal December 3 Follow jdelreal
Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) (Susan Walsh)
Veteran Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin (Iowa) has a less-than-glowing review of the Affordable Care Act — which he helped write and pass in 2010 — and in his final days in Congress is suggesting that Democrats should have considered scrapping the bill altogether.
“We had the power to do it in a way that would have simplified health care, made it more efficient and made it less costly, and we didn’t do it,” Harkin reportedly told The Hill in a piece published Wednesday. “So I look back and say we should have either done it the correct way or not done anything at all.”
He added: “What we did is we muddle[d] through and we got a system that is complex, convoluted, needs probably some corrections and still rewards the insurance companies extensively."
Harkin stressed that key components of the law were necessary and important, including protections for people with pre-existing conditions and allowing grown children to stay on their parents’ health insurance policies until age 26.
But looking back at the early years of the Obama administration, Harkin said Democrats should have pursued “single-payer right from the get-go or at least put a public option. … We had the votes to do that and we blew it."
Such comments aren't exactly new from Harkin, who has spoken about the ACA with critical optimism in the past. “I like to think of this bill as like a starter home. It is not the mansion of our dreams. But it has a solid foundation ... [and] plenty of room for additions and improvements,” he wrote  in the Huffington Post in 2010.
As the veteran lawmaker prepares for retirement at the end of the month, Harkin's unfavorable appraisal of the ACA highlights the extent to which Democrats are distancing themselves from the law five years after it was signed by President Obama.
New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, who has publicly supported the law in the past, also spoke out against it in November during a speech  at the National Press Club. Schumer faulted congressional leaders and the Obama administration for focusing on health-care reform instead of economic issues during the president's first years in office.
"After passing the stimulus, Democrats should have continued to propose middle-class-oriented programs and built on the partial success of the stimulus," he said. "But unfortunately, Democrats blew the opportunity the American people gave them. We took their mandate and put all of our focus on the wrong problem — health-care reform."
Indeed, Democrats locked in tight reelection campaigns during the 2014 cycle went to great lengths to downplay their involvement with the ACA. Nearly all of those Democrats lost their seats in November in a GOP wave largely motivated by anti-Obama sentiment.
Harkin — chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee — didn't speak directly to the electoral consequences the bill may have had, but he did take issue with the compromises made as the bill was being negotiated.
“There’s this old saying: ‘If you have the votes, vote. If you don’t, talk.’ We had the votes but we talked,” he said.

Clintons insulting caution on Keystone XLDid Hillary Clinton learn enough from 2008? She still seems to be self-defeatingly guarded.
Hillary Clinton (Matthew Staver/Bloomberg)
Several   recent   articles  have called Clinton out for refusing to say where she stands on the Keystone XL pipeline . In fact, reporters should be asking her whether she has changed her mind on the issue now that environmentalists have made it into a purity test — because she had sensible things to say about Keystone XL four years ago, before she adopted her strategic silence.
Here is Clinton in 2010 , then secretary of state, speaking at San Francisco’s Commonwealth Club :
We haven’t finish[ed] all of the analysis. So as I say, we’ve not yet signed off on it. But we are inclined to do so and we are for several reasons — going back to one of your original questions — we’re either going to be dependent on dirty oil from the Gulf or dirty oil from Canada. And until we can get our act together as a country and figure out that clean, renewable energy is in both our economic interests and the interests of our planet — (applause) — I mean, I don’t think it will come as a surprise to anyone how deeply disappointed the president and I are about our inability to get the kind of legislation through the Senate that the United States was seeking.
Now, that hasn’t stopped what we’re doing. We have moved a lot on the regulatory front through the EPA here at home and we have been working with a number of countries on adaptation and mitigation measures. But obviously, it was one of the highest priorities of the administration for us to enshrine in legislation President Obama’s commitment to reducing our emissions. So we do have a lot that still must be done. And it is a hard balancing act. It’s a very hard balancing act.
Clinton was responding to a question about the Alberta Clipper, a pipeline that began transporting tar sands oil to Wisconsin in 2010. But the State Department subsequently clarified that she was speaking about Keystone XL . Her remarks were on the right track: The Keystone XL decision will not determine the future of oil use here or abroad, and there are much more important factors that will. Policymakers should focus on those instead of trying to micromanage decisions on energy supply infrastructure, angering our allies in the process.
Does Clinton still hold to those principles? If so, why won’t she admit it? If not, what changed her mind? Clinton is not officially running yet, so she is not under the high obligation to square with the public that candidacy brings. But she isn’t free of obligation; she led the State Department when it considered the issue.
Continuing evasion only communicates one thing: insulting caution. As was often the case in her 2008 run, she gives the impression that she is unwilling to tell you what she really believes, at least not until Mark Penn or some other purveyor of political pablum has sliced it up and served it to the public in its maximally inoffensive — and least interesting — form. That’s infuriating for those who would agree with her — particularly for those who want pro-environment leaders to guide people toward issues that really matter — because she knows better and won’t stick up for their side. It’s patronizing to environmentalists because she is trying to pander to them by refusing to engage them like adults. Clinton’s political calculation is a good sign that she’s running for president — but not an indication that she will do a better job than she did in 2008.

Sabrina Rubin Erdely, the writer of the much-discussed Rolling Stone story about rape at the University of Virginia , told SiriusXM radio host Michael Smerconish that the victim of an alleged gang rape feared that she’d been “set up” for the assault. Erdely’s story details an alleged September 2012 incident in which Jackie, then a freshman at the university, was raped by seven men in a dark room at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. The specifics reported by Erdely are horrifying. For example:
She remembers every moment of the next three hours of agony, during which, she says, seven men took turns raping her, while two more – her date, Drew, and another man – gave instruction and encouragement. She remembers how the spectators swigged beers, and how they called each other nicknames like Armpit and Blanket. She remembers the men’s heft and their sour reek of alcohol mixed with the pungency of marijuana. Most of all, Jackie remembers the pain and the pounding that went on and on.
In the weeks prior to that alleged encounter, Erdely told Smerconish, the “two of them [Drew and Jackie] had spent weeks getting to know each other,” including as lifeguards at the U-Va. pool. “She could never really understand why he, this handsome junior, was paying so much attention to her, this very naive freshman,” while the other lifeguards on her shift were “these model-gorgeous blonds,” said Erdely. “Why would he have chosen me?” said Erdely, summing up Jackie’s thinking. ” ‘He was paying so much attention to me, showing so much interest in everything I had to say.’ And all she could think is that [Drew] was probably grooming her for something like this, and testing her for something like this.”
Smerconish, noting that the title of the story starts with “A Rape on Campus,” asked why there’s no “alleged” in there. “I don’t write the headlines. But I think that we do — this is Jackie’s perspective on her assault. We do write a lot of ‘allegeds’ in there so I think that there’s a lot of implied ‘alleged.’ ”

The body-camera industry is feeling phenomenal after FergusonBy Drew Harwell December 3 Follow @drewharwell

President Obama's call this week to spend $75 million to outfit America’s police departments with body cameras  was celebrated as a move toward officer transparency after the killing of an unarmed teenager in Ferguson, Mo. But few rejoiced like the body-camera industry, which stands to make a fortune off police forces nationwide with newfound millions to spend.
The White House would help buy 50,000 body cameras through a proposed spending match  with local law enforcement, nearly doubling the number of body cameras now in use across the country. And for the two companies in control of the market, the money represents a goldmine: $75 million is more than seven times what Taser International made off body-camera sales last year.
A spokesman for Taser, best known for its electroshock guns, called the Ferguson shooting a "massive awareness campaign" for police body cameras, and investors have feverishly jumped onboard. Taser's stock has almost doubled since Officer Darren Wilson shot Michael Brown in August, climbing on Tuesday to its highest point in nearly 10 years.
Police body cameras, which boosters call one of the best ways to reduce false complaints and prevent abuses of power, were cast into the center of a major policy push after Brown's killing; a grand jury declined to charge Wilson last month. But police agencies wanting the equipment have two options for where to direct their budgets: Vievu, a private Seattle firm that says it has sold more than 40,000 cameras, and Taser, which has sold about 30,000.
"We are feeling phenomenal right now," Taser chief executive Patrick W. Smith said in an earnings call in October. "What everybody thought was crazy five years ago is now accepted as inevitable."
The industry stands to earn money from far more than just the gadgets. Taser is also selling subscriptions to its online data cloud, where terabytes of police video footage can be uploaded, encrypted and stored. Vievu is working with Microsoft  to develop its own cloud platform.
The services solve the police problem of how to manage its sensitive video. Taser's service even comes with redaction features that can blur or mute on command. But they also give the camera companies a lucrative upsell that keeps agencies locked in and paying long-term. About 75 percent of the body cameras Taser sold this year have been packaged with contracts for  evidence.com , Taser's cloud service, which sells for up to $55 per officer a month. Nearly all police departments that signed on, Taser said, opted for multi-year deals.
"The upfront cameras themselves are not that interesting. They are, or will be, fairly quickly commoditized. What investors will pay for is a recurring revenue stream," said Steve Dyer, a senior research analyst with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Taser "rightly saw early on that selling a plastic camera is going to be a lot worse of a business than building long-term relationships."
The industry is still very much in its infancy: The 50,000 cameras supported under Obama's proposal will cover only 7 percent of the more than 700,000 sworn officers in the U.S. That has investors moving in quickly for a foothold in a rising industry, as well as a flood of federal funds. In the two days since the White House's announcement, the market value of Digital Ally, a small Kansas company that makes a video-recording police flashlight, has exploded from $28 million to $55 million.
"I knew once the masses found out this technology existed, everyone would be clamoring for it," Vievu chief executive Steve Ward said. "My dream of putting a camera on every cop is just coming true even quicker."
Some analysts have been skeptical about how closely cameras would be adopted in smaller rural or suburban departments. And critics question just how effective video footage can be in holding officers accountable: After the caught-on-camera police chokehold death of an unarmed man in Staten Island, a grand jury declined to bring charges against the officer involved.
But body cameras already have a strong track record. One year after officers in Rialto, Calif., began wearing cameras , complaints against officers and police use of force plunged. Jim Buerrmann, president of the Police Foundation in Washington,  said , "Within the next five years or so, body-worn cameras will be as ubiquitous in the world of policing as handcuffs, the police radio, the gun."
That's great news for Taser, which has invested heavily to convince America's police forces to upgrade with the company's tech. At an International Association of Chiefs of Police conference in October, Taser, whose theme was "Don't Be a Dinosaur," paid for two life-sized velociraptors to walk the exhibit grounds and handed out large stuffed dinosaurs. Smith, the Taser chief executive, said in October that it was "the most impactful marketing campaign in the history of law enforcement."

Taser's Axon clip-on body camera looks like a pager and comes with a wide-angle digital lens. Though cameras like it sold in recent years for about $1,000, competition has driven its price down to $399; a sleeker eyeglass-mounted camera, the Axon Flex, sells for $599. Like many modern gadgets, the real money for the sellers will come from long-term contracts: Taser executives said most police departments are signing deals on Taser's "Ultimate" plan, in which body cameras are replaced or upgraded every two to three years.
Taser says its body cameras have now been deployed in all 50 states, implemented in 13 major cities and are now in trial in 35 more. Officers in the St. Louis suburb where Brown was killed have since started wearing the cameras. The New York Police Department became the largest in America to start using the cameras when it launched its pilot program in September, and further expansion could be hugely lucrative: Outfitting the whole department would cost about $32 million.
What does Taser have over, say, a wearable-camera giant like GoPro? Long business partnerships with police agencies, name recognition among officers and a steely style of marketing squarely aimed at the criminal-defense set. That competitive advantage, analysts said, could make it easier for body-camera makers to stay in public budgets for years to come.
Taser's chief executive compared the rise of body cameras to the early days of its Taser guns: Though at first resisted by officers as too controversial, they are now nearly ubiquitous, found in all but 1,000 of the nation's 18,000 police departments. Dashboard cameras in police cruisers saw similar resistance but are now standard issue. And White House backing gives the program that much more oomph: A similar White House fund-matching program led police departments to buy more than a million protective vests.
Taser's business could extend far beyond the American badge. The company has invested in an international sales plan, with arms in Europe and Asia hawking its nonlethal weaponry, body cameras and access to the evidence cloud. Some of the largest agencies in Brazil are now testing Axon cameras, deployed from an Amazon.com data center in São Paulo, Smith said. (The global expansion comes with its own logistical issues: Some international clients, worrying over privacy rights, insist that their footage be stored on servers outside the U.S.)
Taser first got into the video business by attaching cameras to its shock weaponry, but the technology had two fatal flaws: It only recorded footage in the rare moments when aimed, and it did little to calm the situation now on tape. The firm later worked with the Oakley sunglass chain, an officer favorite, to develop something more passive and easy to use, but has begun looking at its cloud offerings as the next step to get police departments hooked.
"Anybody can make a camera. That's not the trick. The trick is: Can you make an ecosystem … to get police into that 21st century mindset?" said Steve Tuttle, a Taser spokesman. "It's not a panacea. It's not a magic bullet. … But we're about as close as you can get right now."

Rohtak harassment: Two more eyewitnesses submit affidavits in support of accused youthsRohtak sisters were not molested in bus, claim fresh witnesses
Sat Singh , Hindustan Times  Rohtak, December 03, 2014
First Published: 20:37 IST(3/12/2014) | Last Updated: 14:49 IST(4/12/2014)
Two fresh witnesses have come forward with accounts that could scuttle the sexual harassment charges lodged by two Haryana sisters against three youths.
 
They submitted their affidavits on Wednesday to police in support of the three youths - Kuldeep, Deepak and Mohit - accused of sexually harassing the sisters aboard Haryana Roadway bus on November 28.
 
Five others, some of them claiming to be the passengers on the Haryana Roadway bus in which the incident occurred, also shared their affidavits with reporters and stressed that the men have been wronged.
 
Fracas over seats

In her affidavit, Bimla, a resident of Sonepat district, said, she was waiting for bus at Rohtak bus stand. As soon as the bus reached the counter, she asked two of the boys to get seats for her and another woman who was unwell. When the boys requested the two girls - Aarti and Pooja - to vacate the seat allotted for the ailing woman, they refused and went ballistic. They later belted the boys after heated exchange of words. Another girl accompanying them captured the incident on mobile camera. To save themselves, the two boys jumped off the bus, said Bimla in her affidavit.
Three women passengers from Thanakhurd village, the native place of the sisters, have also given similar statements to the police.
 
Eyewitness account of over month-old video
Two witnesses have also given statements in connection with a month-old video showing the sisters beating up a boy in a Rohtak park .
According to Virender Dhankar and Yogeshwer, residents of Baketa village in Rohtak, they were present at the Huda City Park in Rohtak when the incident happened. The girls abused and tore off a boy’s clothes after he asked them why they were wasting their time in the park instead of attending college. Another girl accompanying them videographed it, he told the police.
 
However, now it seems the job of holding up the girls’ accusation rests entirely on the statements given by the conductor and the bus driver.
According to Labh Singh, the conductor of the Haryana Roadway bus on which the incident occurred: “These girls and boys were arguing over some issue. I asked the girls if they wanted the driver to take the bus to the nearest police station. They refused. After the boys misbehaved with them, they beat them up. I have recorded my statement before police, but I was suspended.”
 
Rohtak superintendent of police Shashank Anand said, “We are trying to finalise the chargesheet. We have recorded the statements of the driver and conductor, who have given statements in support of registration of FIR. We have come to know from media reports that some bus passengers have come forward with affidavits. We will record their statements as per the procedure,” he said.

Why now would be a very good time to raise the gas taxBy Chris Mooney December 3 Follow chriscmooney

Nationally averaged gas prices ticked down a little lower today -- yet again -- to $2.75 per gallon . They're now more than 50 cents lower than they were a year ago. So no wonder, at a time like this, the murmur is growing: Maybe Congress ought to think about raising the national gasoline tax .
It was last raised , in the year 1993, to 18.4 cents per gallon. That's over 20 years ago, and gas prices at the time were close to the now unimaginable  $1.00 per gallon  mark. Yet the amount of the gas tax was fixed and not tied to inflation -- so it has not changed since. (U.S. states also charge gasoline taxes ; the national average is about 23.5 cents.)
"It’s been a generation since gas taxes were increased at all," says Paul Bledsoe, a senior fellow on energy at the German Marshall Fund. "So they are incredibly low by historic levels."
Meanwhile, the Highway Trust Fund, which depends on these federal gas tax revenues, has seen its revenues fail to match its level of spending for 13 years straight. Not only has the gas tax been fixed for two decades, but vehicles also have become a lot more fuel efficient . That has led to less gasoline use and less gas tax paid per mile driven -- even as alternative fuel vehicles like hybrids have also hit the road.
"You’re ending up with serious reductions in highway fund revenues, and that’s sort of the fundamental reason why we’re having all these infrastructure problems," says Alan Krupnick , co-director of the Center for Energy and Climate Economics at Resources for the Future.
Timing a gas tax increase for a time like right now -- when gas prices have been plunging, and may have further to fall -- would surely be the easiest on consumers. It "would be kind of in the noise," says Krupnick. But it could help address at least three different problems: inadequate highway funding, American's energy habits, and even, perhaps, bipartisan tax reform.
1. Fix Our Highway Infrastructure. It is no secret that the nation’s roads are seriously in need of infrastructure improvements.  According to  the American Society of Civil Engineers, U.S. roads currently earn a "D" overall. Their “deficiencies,” says the society, cost us $130 billion per year, and we’re currently investing too little to improve them.
The current overall spending level of $91 billion annually on capital investments by state, federal, and local authorities is not enough to prevent continuing declines in road quality, according to ASCE. We need to be spending $ 101 billion per year just to keep pace, and $170 billion per year to actually improve the nation’s roads.
Meanwhile, the federal gas tax is less and less able to cover the cost of all this. A ccording to  the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, the gas tax has lost "28 percent of its value since 1997" as costs of highway construction and repair have grown, and as vehicle fuel efficiency has increased.
Source: Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy .
2. Green Our Behavior. Much like a carbon tax , a tax on gasoline can also, of course, make people more judicious in how they use vehicles and energy. A 2011 study by scholars from Resources from the Future and Harvard University found that increases in gasoline taxes have a significantly larger effect on consumer behavior than do mere increases in the retail price of gasoline.
In particular, they found, a one dollar rise in gas prices alone (due to market forces but without any tax increase) would lead to an increase in the average miles per gallon of new vehicles purchased by 3.6 percent. However, a one dollar gasoline tax increase would have a much bigger effect, leading to an increase in the miles per gallon of new vehicles of 47.7 percent.
"The difference between the fuel economy response to tax-exclusive price changes and that to gasoline tax changes is striking," noted the authors, while also admitting that a $ 1.00 gas tax increase is a rather extreme amount, and so the result should considered in that light.
3. Help Us Find Tax Reform Compromise. Most blue sky is the idea that raising the gas tax significantly could provide a major new revenue source that would make tax reform compromise easier. Paul Bledsoe, of the German Marshall Fund, calls the gas tax the "800 pound gorilla of tax policy that suddenly comes back into the spotlight when oil prices drop 30 percent."
The reason is that if we want to cut corporate or income taxes, those revenues to government will have to be replaced -- and "there are very few places you can turn to replace 100 to 200 billion dollars in revenue a year," says Bledsoe. He thinks that ultimately, if there is going to be a grand stroke compromise on tax reform, it may involve someone bringing up the gas tax.
Which merely leaves the matter of politics. Who supports a gas price increase? Broadly speaking, it's something that economic wonks across the spectrum seem to favor, but that politicians loathe (presumably because of the word "tax"). However, Republican Senator John Thune of South Dakota -- slated to be the new chair of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee --  has said he would consider a gas price increase as a way of fixing the Highway Trust Fund in the next Congress. Last year, Democratic Rep. Earl Blumenauer of Oregon also proposed a 15 cent gas tax raise.
So, this is not an argument that a gas tax raise is politically plausible -- any more than a economically efficient tax on carbon would be. It's merely a suggestion that -- ignoring politics -- it might be a pretty good idea.

How robust is government sLong, long slog to mend public finances
 
The £50bn gap between Tories and Labour
There are three big new fiscal stories in this year's Autumn Statement (please try to contain your excitement).
The first one is that public sector borrowing this year is expected to fall by just over 6% to £91.3bn - but that is a good deal less than the 13% fall that was expected just nine months ago in the budget.
And, by the way, the deficit - at 5% of GDP or national income - is still uncomfortably wide (greater, for example, than the deficits of France and Italy, which are widely seen as in worse economic and fiscal shape than Britain).
So the job of mending the public finances is a long way from over.
The second story is that the best performing, big developed economy in the world - that's us by the way, as assessed by speed of GDP growth - is generating far less tax than expected.
So this year, the Office for Budget Responsibility expects the harvest for the Exchequer from taxation to be £7.8bn less than it predicted in March. And by 2017-18, it says the shortfall will be an eye-watering £21bn.
And the biggest shortfall, roughly half of it, is in income tax, which reflects the creation of lots of new low wage jobs and the absence of meaningful pay rises for millions.
Inflation windfall
What is striking is that the OBR seems to see this shift to lower wages and taxes as, to an extent, reflecting a change in the structure of the economy, rather than a passing phenomenon.
The third story is that there are two useful windfalls for the government, from the fall in the interest rates it has to pay on its debts and from the fall in inflation.
The government is expected to pay £5bn less in interest on gilts or its debts this year than was expected in March. And by 2017-18 that saving will have increased to about £16bn - as the Treasury gets the cumulative benefit of refinancing its existing debts at lower rates of interest.
Also by 2017-18 the Treasury should save around £3bn on welfare and public-sector pension payments, because the fall in inflation should mean lower cash increases in these outgoings.
For the birds?
What matters is that the swings and roundabouts of less tax, lower interest payments and lower inflation mean nothing much of any significance has happened to the government's plans to generate a surplus by 2018/19 - which it now expects to be a surplus of £4bn, up from a forecast £3.7bn made in March.
That allows the Tories and LibDems to claim that they remain on course to fill the black hole in the public finances - albeit a few years later than they promised when elected in 2010.
And it also allows Labour to complain that fiscal rehabilitation, in the style of Tories and LibDems, always comes tomorrow (although Ed Balls's alternative prescription, which some see as paradoxical, is to promise to balance the books later than the Tories and in a less demanding way).
There are two more things to say.
One is that it is altogether plausible that wages could rise faster than the OBR expects, as could inflation and interest rates. In which case all its fiscal forecasts would be for the birds.
New contract?
The second is that the OBR has shone a very bright light on the implications of the Tories' pledge to generate a budget surplus by 2019/20 from spending cuts rather than tax rises.
It shows that that if a new Tory government delivered on its pledge to protect spending on schools and hospitals, the cuts for other public services - such as the police, courts, social services, local government and so on - would be so big as perhaps to defy credibility.
The OBR calculates that spending per head in real terms in 2019/20 on the public sector minus health and schools would be £1,290, or 57% less than in 2009/10.
Could savings of that magnitude be achieved, without completely changing the implied contract between citizen and state?
Doubtless, in some form or other, that will be part of the debate between now and a general election, which begins to feel quite close.
UPDATE: 18.20
The Tories say that future cuts to ministerial budgets may be less than the OBR expects for two reasons
First, they say they can increase revenues by £5bn by a further attack on tax avoidance.
And they also say there is the potential to save more from the welfare bill.
Their hope is that this would reduce the magnitude of cuts to public services by a half.
But they are yet to provide detail on these alternative deficit-reduction measures.
And even with them, the size of future shrinkage to the state would still be quite something.

OBR warns public spendingRobinson: A pre-election Budget?
The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) says spending on public services is heading for an 80-year low.
In its report accompanying the Autumn Statement, it projected that spending by central government on public services was going to fall from 21.2% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2009-10 to 12.6% in 2019-20.
As a proportion of GDP, that would probably take spending on public services to its lowest since the 1930s.
There's still a lot of cutting to come.
The OBR said that of the cuts to be made over that 10 year period, 40% would be during the current Parliament and the remaining 60% during the next Parliament.
As the chart from the OBR shows, we do not know where those cuts will come from in the last four years of the period, but they are big enough for the OBR to have questioned whether it was reasonable to accept that they were possible.
This is particularly an issue if the areas whose spending is currently protected - health, education and international development - continue to be protected.
"The implied cuts... during the next Parliament would pose a significant challenge if they were confirmed as firm policy, one that would be all the greater if existing protections were maintained," the OBR said, before concluding that it would nonetheless not be appropriate for it to declare they were not possible until there were signs of the government failing to achieve some its cuts.
If protected areas continue to be protected, the OBR calculated that spending by other departments would fall from £3,020 per person in 2009-10 to £1,290 per person by 2019-20 (all in 2014-15 prices), which would be a fall of 57.3%.
And that sounds like a big job for whichever party or coalition ends up in government after next year's election.

KG-D6 contractors liable to pay $195 m more to Centre: PradhanKG-D6 contractors liable to pay $195 m more to Centre: Pradhan
Our Bureau
Tweet
New Delhi, December 3:  
Reliance Industries Ltd and its partners in KG-D6 block are liable to pay an additional $195.34 million to the Centre for the period up to 2013-14 on account of disallowed development costs.
This information was given by the Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Petroleum and Natural Gas, Dharmendra Pradhan, to the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday.
Pradhan said that $2.376 billion of development cost has been disallowed for the contractors (RIL-BP-Niko) of the KG-D6 block due to shortfall in gas production under the approved Addendum to Initial Development Plan.
To another question, Pradhan said that the Kelkar Committee has recommended that production sharing is the preferred contractual model for Indian basins.
Production sharing
“The Kelkar Committee has proposed two fiscal regimes, either of which could be deployed,” the Minister told the Rajya Sabha.
One of the suggestions is to have PSC (production-sharing contract) linked to an investment multiple with modified contract administration, including self-certification of costs by the contractors. The other model is a PSC with biddable supernormal profits tax.
The Minister said that the Kelkar Committee has also recommended that the Directorate-General of Hydrocarbons be made an independent regulator for upstream oil and gas and be given quasi-judicial powers with an appellate tribunal.
Pradhan added that the Government has not yet finalised its response to the report of the committee.

The New Black Friday Means Lines But Less Frenzy At Kmart  SearsThe New Black Friday Means Lines But Less Frenzy At Kmart, Sears
Posted:
reddit
DES PLAINES, Ill. -- "Be safe everybody," a Kmart worker instructed customers here as they filed into the store at 6 a.m. on Thanksgiving Day, looking for deals on items such as headphones and clothes.
But the instruction may have been more of a formality. Once the dozens of people lined up outside the store were inside, they calmly browsed the aisles and compared prices on towels and toasters to those listed in the circulars they had brought along.

Welcome to the new Black Friday . It starts on Thursday or even earlier, lasts for days and isn't quite the harried environment of years past. The increased popularity of online shopping, combined with retailers' interest in capturing shoppers' limited dollars as early as possible, has made the one-day deal bonanza obsolete. Instead, this year Walmart, Target, Amazon and others offered days of deals starting in mid-November.
Sears, which is also owned by Kmart's parent company, Sears Holdings Corp., opened at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving, two hours earlier than last year, and offered its longest string of doorbuster sales ever -- more than 1,000 deals over a 17-hour period -- said Jamie Stein, the vice president of public relations at Sears Holdings. The chain is also letting shoppers buy items online and pick them up in person at both Sears and Kmart stores. At one New York Kmart, more than 100 people stopped in Thursday in a period of just a few hours to pick up items they ordered online, Stein said.
"That's what we saw this year, not a Black Friday but a Black November," Stein said Friday. "In previous years, the focus on one day did create this craze, but was that the best for our customers? Now it's less of a frenzy but better in the end."
Crowds were reportedly thin at malls across the country on Friday morning.

Of course, there were still some elements of the classic Black Friday frenzy at stores across the country. Stein said Kmart managers reported "consistent lines" at 6 a.m. openings Thursday, with 100 people waiting to get in on average.
The increased availability of earlier deals didn't change the holiday plans of Cindy Bergate and Nancy McFall, two shoppers who were browsing the shoe aisles here around 6:15 a.m. on Thanksgiving. The two said they've been Black Friday shopping with four other relatives for years.
After Kmart, they were headed home to cook and eat Thanksgiving dinner, then someone in their shopping crew would leave the meal early to get in line at Walmart. They said they also planned to hit Target and other stores and then head back out again on Friday.
"We're crazy," said McFall, 48, adding that she preferred the experience in years past when shoppers waited in line outside for hours.
Pam Pitakis, 53, who was browsing a rack of jackets that were 50 percent off, said she's nostalgic for the traditional Black Friday for different reasons.
"It's kind of annoying" that so many deals are on Thanksgiving, she said. Pitakis came to Kmart in the wee hours of the morning to get a tablet. "We'd rather just have it be on Black Friday."
Stores have been opening earlier on Thanksgiving in recent years.
Kmart has been open on Thanksgiving for 23 years. But it's been a target of criticism in recent years, along with other retailers, as more chains moved their opening times and best deals to earlier on the holiday. Detractors deride the stores for requiring workers to come in on the holiday and compelling shoppers to rearrange their turkey dinners to make it in time for deals.
"I hate this time of year," one Kmart veteran who works in human resources in a California store told The Huffington Post earlier this month. Several others, who also requested anonymity to protect their jobs, expressed similar sentiments in interviews, saying they weren't given the option not to work on Thanksgiving.
Stein said the company "makes every effort" to staff its stores on the holidays with seasonal employees and volunteers before requiring others to come in. Many employees appreciate the chance to work the holiday because they're paid one and a half times their hourly rate, she said.
The retail giant sets holiday hours for Sears and Kmart based on feedback the company has heard from customers, Stein said. It's also an aim to stay competitive with other retailers.
Sears Holdings has been struggling for the past several years. The chain hasn't reported a positive quarter of same-store sales since 2005, according to Retail Metrics, a retail data firm. CEO Eddie Lampert has been using a controversial strategy to turn things around that critics argue has little to do with actually selling more stuff.
The company is trying to maximize the value of its real estate by selling hundreds of its stores to a newly formed real estate investment trust and renting out space to stores such as Whole Foods , Dick's Sporting Goods and others. It's shuttering other, underperforming locations by the dozens .
"It's a very difficult scenario that they find themselves in," said Ken Perkins, the founder of Retail Metrics. "There's no buzz."
Those difficulties are compounded by the struggles facing other retailers that cater to low- and middle-income shoppers. Slow wage growth has meant that most Americans have limited money to spend in stores. Chains are ramping up the deals all month in hopes that strapped Americans will spend their money in their stores, but the traffic and high volume of purchases at steep discounts may do little to actually help their bottom lines, according to Mark Cohen, the director of retail studies at Columbia Business School.
Sears and Kmart "are attempting to participate aggressively," said Cohen, a former CEO of Sears Canada. "At the end of the day, it's all for naught. This entire Black Friday window of hyper-promotion is really a race to the bottom for all retailers participating."

How To Avoid Scams This Cyber Monday
The Solution To Climate Change Isn t Difficult - It s Deliciousreddit
Solution aversion. That's what Duke University researchers call our society's collective refusal to address climate change. Their recent study found that people don't deny a warming earth on scientific grounds -- they deny it because they just don't like the solutions.
But what if the solution to climate change isn't actually burdensome? What if instead of complicating and disrupting our lives it enriches them and makes us happier and healthier? What if it's delicious?
We don't have to relinquish our cars, move to the woods, and get off the grid to conquer climate change. The real solution is simple and easy: eat plants.
Though the figures vary, World Bank scientists have attributed up to 51 percent of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions to the livestock industry. The cows, pigs, chickens and other animals raised for food across the globe -- and the industry of which they're a part -- contribute more to rising temperatures and oceans than all the planes, cars, trucks, boats and trains in the world.
How could this possibly be the case? Much of the impact stems from the process of growing grains to feed the many billions of animals that eventually reach our plates. Fields of corn and soy are heavily doused with petroleum-based fertilizers and pesticides and then plowed, irrigated, harvested and transported with fossil fuel-powered machines.
Once these grains reach the farms, which are almost always massive facilities heated, cooled and lit by fossil fuels, animals digest them, and in the process, belch and excrete methane. Many times more potent than CO2 in climate change-causing potential, methane exudes from the animals and their waste, which is often stored in enormous, open-air pits. Finally, the animals are transported in trucks to petro-powered slaughterhouses, packed, shipped and stored with even more emissions.
All told, this process makes meat, dairy and other animal products far more carbon-intensive than producing plants for humans to eat directly. It takes an average of 28 calories of fossil fuel to produce one calorie of meat protein for human consumption. Compare that to just 3.3 fossil fuel calories to produce a calorie of protein from grains.
That's why the United Nations has stated plainly that "a substantial worldwide diet change, away from animal products" is necessary to avert the worst environmental impacts -- including climate change.
This sounds daunting, but would such a global shift be so difficult? Is it something we should dread or embrace?
It turns out that eating vegan has never been easier or more enjoyable. The number of vegan and veg-friendly restaurants is skyrocketing across the world, as is the number, variety and quality of vegan products, like plant-based milks and meat alternatives appearing in grocery stores everywhere. Vegan food is quickly becoming a culinary phenomenon, enchanting even world-renowned chefs at the most famous restaurants.
But it doesn't have to be fancy or expensive, and it's certainly not a rarity. A bowl of rice, beans and veggies is one of the cheapest meals you could eat, and vegan fare is a feature of almost every global cuisine: Mexican, Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese, Indian, Ethiopian and even Italian.
Going vegan brings other benefits, too. Eating plants spares animals from a lifetime of suffering on factory farms and from often painful deaths. Cows, pigs, chickens and the other animals whose bodies and by-products we eat are just as sensitive and intelligent as the dogs and cats we love. It's also the healthiest diet: Those who cut out meat, dairy and eggs live longer and enjoy far lower rates of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, obesity and cancer.
In the race against climate change, there's certainly a place for electric cars and scaling back consumption. But the best solution requires neither cutting-edge technology nor a reclusive, monk-like lifestyle. It's something every individual can do -- and it's something we can all savor at breakfast, lunch and dinner.

RBI  Reasonably Comfortable  With Current Account DeficitChina December Industrial Activity Shrinks for First Time in 7 Months
Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India is "reasonably comfortable" with the current account deficit because of lower oil prices, Deputy Governor H R Khan said on Wednesday, after the country last week unexpectedly eased some rules on gold imports.
"We are reasonably comfortable from the current account point of view because of oil," Mr Khan told reporters in the sidelines of an event in Mumbai.
"So taking all that into account, a view has been taken that we'll give up this 80:20 (rule on gold imports)," he told reporters.
India on Friday scrapped a rule mandating traders to export 20 per cent of all gold imported into the country - in what had been known as the '80:20' rule.
The government will soon announce the current account deficit for the July-September quarter.

Kudankulam units 3  4 cost more than doubles over liability issuesNew Delhi, December 3, 2014

Kudankulam units 3, 4 cost more than doubles over liability issues

nuclear power
The approved cost of units 1 and 2 is Rs. 17,270 crore while the approved cost of units 3 and 4 is Rs 39,747 crore, Centre tells Lok Sabha.
Due to liability issues, the cost of units 3 and 4 of the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project has shot up to Rs. 39,747 crore, more than twice the cost of units 1 and 2, which will lead to an increase in per unit cost of power.
The approved cost of units 1 and 2 is Rs. 17,270 crore while the approved cost of units 3 and 4 is Rs 39,747 crore, Minister of State for Department of Atomic Energy Jitendra Singh said in a written response to a question in Lok Sabha on Wednesday.
Sources in DAE pointed out that the high price was due to the liability issue under which the operators and suppliers have to insure the units. All the four reactors, with a capacity of 1,000 MW each, have been built with Russian assistance.
The unit, which was shut down due to technical reasons, is expected to start generating power this week. It was connected to southern grid in October 2013.
The approved cost of the Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor at Kalpakkam is Rs. 5,677 crore, while units 7 and 8 of Rajasthan Atomic Power Station (RAPS) is Rs. 12,320 crore. For units 3 and 4 of Kakrapar Rs. 11,459 crore have been approved.
Unit 1 of Kudankulam achieved full power in June 2014 and has so far generated 2,825 MW electricity, while unit 2 is at commissioning stage.

Swearing-in ceremony of Shiv Sena and BJP ministers to take place on FridayWritten by Shubhangi Khapre | Mumbai |
Posted: December 3, 2014 9:14 pm | Updated: December 4, 2014 1:52 pm
The swearing-in ceremony of Shiv Sena and BJP ministers will take place on Friday morning. Highly placed sources in BJP and Sena confirmed that cabinet size will remain moderate as Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis is not willing to fill up all 36 berths on Friday.
The BJP has urged Sena to give the list of only seven to eight ministers out of 12 promised to them. Similarly, BJP will also induct only seven to nine candidates. Thus the vacancies which remain would be filled up after the three weeks winter session at Nagpur ends on December 24.
The Sena ministers who are in the reckoning include Eknath Shinde, Diwakar Raote, Subash Desai, Ramdas Kadam, Neelam Gorhe, Vaibhav Naik et al.
The Sena has been given five cabinet rank and seven ministers of state. The portfolios for cabinet rank ministers which have been agreed mutually includes –industry, health, environment, Public Works Department (MSRDC) and excise.
Insiders in the BJP disclosed, “ The BJP had made it clear to the Sena that they would not like to negotiate on portfolios like home, urban
development, finance, general administration, rural development and revenue.” Interestingly, urban development, home, GAD are held by
Fadnavis.
The BJP is willing to give energy portfolio to Sena. But the Sena is not very keen on the portfolio.
Interestingly, BJP has also ensured that even junior rank ministers (MoS) of Sena are not given important portfolios like home, urban
development and finance. But it has agreed to accommodate Sena MoS in revenue, water resources, women and child development et al.
However, Sena which was keen all 12 ministers are included in the cabinet on Friday has urged BJP to make its promise public.  A Sena
functionary said, “ We understand chief minister wants to keep a moderate expansion on Friday ahead of winter session. But we want them to announce in public their promise of 12 ministers.”
The BJP’s decision to keep vacancies is to diffuse unrest as number of aspirants seeking ministerial post outnumbers the size. Fadnavis has
submitted a list of probable candidates who would become the ministers to all India party president Amit Shah on Wednesday.
Sources said, “ The BJP candidates for ministers are Girish Bapat, Girish Mahajan, Jaiprakash Rawal, Subash Deshmukh, Chandrashekhar
Bawankule, Ram Shinde, Mangalprabhat Lodha et al.”
The BJP which has 9 council of miister lead by Fadnavis is also under pressure to accommodate atleast two candidates from its smaller
alliance partners namely Republican Party of India and Rashtriya Samaj Party.

A six – month old baby girl was raped by a man acquainted with the family in Patan district early on Wednesday. The girl now hospitalized in recouping while the accused is at large.

New Delhi railway station to get Wi-fi from ThursdayPosted: December 3, 2014 8:47 pm
 
Come Thursday and passengers at New Delhi railway station would be able to access Wi-fi internet within its premises as the public transporter is kicking off a scheme for providing more connectivity at stations.
Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu will launch the Wi-fi facility at the busiest station in the country here with the project being implemented by RailTel, a railway PSU which is mandated to provide the service at major stations across the country.
Passengers on all 16 platforms at New Delhi railway station will be able to access the Wi-fi internet.
“We are providing the Wi-fi service as a value-added facility for passengers,” said a senior railway ministry official.
The Wi-fi facility shall be available free of cost for an initial period of 30 minutes and would require the people at the station to register for the same through their mobile phones.
For usage beyond 30 minutes, the user may purchase scratch cards which will be made available at 24X7 Wi-fi helpdesks on the concourse at the Paharganj and Ajmeri gate sides of New Delhi railway station.
“These cards are priced at Rs 25 for 30 minutes and Rs 35 for one hour and are valid through 24 hours,” said the official.
The total cost of the project is Rs 50 lakh and an amount of Rs 16 lakh will be spent annually to run the facility. The Wi-fi facility is to be provided at 75 major category stations within a year.
The facility is to be launched on a trial basis at Agra, Ahmedabad and Varanasi by the end of December and at Howrah, Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus and Secunderabad by January next year.
New Delhi station is the busiest station in the country with about 300 trains and close to 5 lakh passengers coming to its platforms daily.

Indian woman gangraped in Nepals Gadhimai FestivalBy: Press Trust of India | Kathmandu |
Posted: December 3, 2014 8:29 pm
A 20-year-old Indian woman, who was in Nepal to take part in the famous Gadhimai festival, was gangraped by seven men, police said on Wednesday.
The devotee, who hailed from Motihari in Bihar, reached Nepal’s southern Bara district to visit the religious site and was gangraped on Tuesday, according to Deputy Superintendent of Police of the district, Rabindra Regmi.
A gang of local men took her to a nearby lonely area in the premises of the temple and raped her on Tuesday afternoon, the police officer told PTI over phone.
A police team, who had been patrolling in the area, heard the victim’s screams for help.
The policemen immediately rescued the victim and nabbed all of the perpetrators, according to the officer, who said that legal action has been initiated against all the culprits.
The victim is kept under the protection of women and children service centre of the district police office where she was provided with necessary care, food and clothes, the police said.

3-yr-old sexually abused in Bengaluru school twiceComments
A three-year-old girl was allegedly sexually assaulted twice in the premises of a private school in the fifth such incident in as many months.
The accused, a school attendant, was arrested on November 30 after the mother of the victim registered a police complaint, city police commissioner M N Reddi told PTI.
In the complaint filed on November 29, the mother alleged that the child was sexually abused twice on October 22 and November 26, Reddi said.
The attendant has been booked under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act and Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code (relating to punishment for rape).
The latest incident comes weeks after the sexual assault of a six-year-old girl in a school by a Hindi teacher who was arrested. In another incident in October, an office assistant in a school here was arrested for sexual assault of a three-and-a-half-year girl.
An eight-year-old girl was allegedly sexually assaulted by her 63-year-old teacher inside her school premises over a period of time with the offence coming to light in early August, barely a month after the rape of a six-year-old girl at 'Vibgyor High' school.
The series of incidents of sexual assault of minor girls in schools in Bengaluru has led to concerns over safety of children. Police had issued safety guidelines for schools, which in many cases have been found to be observing them in the breach.

Google is replacing the CAPTCHA with a simple checkbox( bekathwia )
For years, Internet services tried to block spammers and bots by making Web users read a distorted series of characters and asking them to type back what they saw. Humans are a lot better at interpreting what machines see as gobbledygook — or so the theory went. But in April, research from Google showed that computers are just as good at defeating these security systems, known as CAPTCHAs, as real people. In its tests, the search giant demonstrated that sophisticated computer programs could fool the typical CAPTCHA 99.8 percent of the time.
So now Google is rolling out the next generation of this technology, which to most casual observers doesn't resemble a CAPTCHA at all. Instead of seeing a box like this:
Users will now be presented with a checkbox that they can click with their mouse or, if they're on a mobile device, tap with a finger.
Powering the new "No-CAPTCHA," as Google calls it, is a powerful back-end algorithm. And Google is encouraging any site that uses CAPTCHAs to switch to the new kind. Already, services including Snapchat and WordPress have begun deploying the No-CAPTCHA to speed humans through the verification process.
The old CAPTCHAs aren't disappearing entirely just yet, however. They'll continue to show up when Google's algorithm decides it needs extra proof beyond the checkbox.

Prabhu ropes in D K Mittal to head panel on Railway financial healthPrabhu ropes in D K Mittal to head panel on Railway financial health
Jyoti Mukul | New Delhi Dec 04, 2014 12:24 AM IST
To chalk out a clear vision for the Indian Railways and align Budget announcements with it, Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu has formed a committee under D K Mittal, former secretary, financial services. The committee, which would suggest ways of improving railway finances, has a tight deadline of December 21 to summit its report.
A senior railway ministry official said Prabhu wanted certain concrete measures to be presented to Parliament in the Railway Budget for 2015-16 in February. The nine-member committee would have representation from the finance ministry. Financial secretary, Railway Board, chairmen and managing directors of railway public-sector units — RITES, Ircon and Concor — besides the managing director of Railway Land Development Authority would be part of the committee.
Two members from Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and Mckinsey India would also be members on the panel. The terms of reference include studying the efficacy and sufficiency of the existing revenue structure and avenues for raising revenues besides identifying leakages of revenue.
This is the second committee formed by Prabhu within a month of taking charge as railway minister on November 10. He had roped in E Sreedharan, principal advisor to Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) and its former managing director, last month for suggesting ways of improving railway tendering. Suggesting greater delegation of powers to general managers (GM) and divisional railway managers (DRM), Sreedharan has already submitted an interim report to Prabhu. “Powers will be delegated to GMs and DRMs for speedy implementation of projects. Hope transparency and merit prevails,” Prabhu tweeted after Sreedharan submitted the report last week.
A Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report had said last week that the railway did not follow proper accounting norms for financial transactions.
The Railways under the United Progressive Alliance rule had introduced reforms in its tariff policy by introducing fuel adjustment component in both passenger and freight rates. Besides, tariff fixation was also taken out of the Railway Budget announcements. These measures, however, did not help in improving its financial health.
Loaded with the burden of higher salaries and pension, the government-run system spends Rs 93 to earn a hundred. After paying the obligatory dividend and lease charges, the surplus is estimated at a mere Rs 602 crore in the current financial year, substantially down from Rs 11,754 crore in 2007-08. Last year, the Railways ended with a surplus of Rs 3,783 crore, which was Rs 4,160 crore short of the revised target.
The Mittal panel would also identify areas in the existing revenue structure for improving revenue, besides looking for additional avenues for generating and increasing revenues. It would also recommend measures for monetisation of resources of the railways.
On the expenditure side, the committee would suggest measures for reduction in spending. For a long-term modernisation and expansion plan, it would identify impediments and suggest remedial measures.  
CAG’s findings for FY13 also showed the Railways did not follow its own rules and regulations laid down under the financial and engineering code for efficient execution of projects.

Ahead of Budget  states should generate their own resources: FMArun Jaitley
(Jaitley said the economies…)
SRINAGAR: Ahead of next Union Budget , Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today hinted at a cut in grants from the Centre to states, saying the states will have to stand on their own by generating resources for development and other schemes.
"Gone are the days when the Centre would provide money and the states would run the government. Today every state has to stand on its own," Jaitley said during a public meeting here.
Jaitley said the economies of the states in the country depend on investments made by the investors, who, besides looking for profits, also create employment.
"How does the economy of a state work? Investments are required for it and investors want profit. Besides looking for profit, the investors create employment and pays taxes to the government. The state government gets money which it can use for development and make schemes for the poor people," he said.
Talking about Jammu and Kashmir, Jaitley said the state has huge potential in tourism, water resources and handicrafts sectors which has not been fully tapped so far.
"Jammu and Kashmir has huge potential. Kashmir valley has huge potential in tourism of all kinds -- be it sightseeing, religious tourism, adventure or historic places. The state has so much water and so much electricity can be generated that it can be sent to other state," he said.
The Union Minister , who professed to be an avid collector of Kashmiri handicrafts, said this sector alone can generate income for the state as well as employment for the artisans.
"I have travelled around the world and I have no hesitation to say that what Kashmiri artisans weave is best in the world," he said.
Jaitley said the state has not been able to benefit from these resources.
"There are so many countries in the world where main source of economy is tourism," he said.
Earlier, Jaitley had said that several more steps are required to create even more positive environment (for economy) not only by the Central government but also by the state governments and several other institutions, which include the Opposition parties in Parliament.

PM Narendra Modi s sweeping poll win has potential to transform India: USelection victory
(There is an important window…)
WASHINGTON: There is an "important window of opportunity" for boosting economic ties with India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's sweeping election victory as well as economic reform platform has the potential to transform the country, a US Treasury official has said.
Nathan Sheets , who is Under Secretary for International Affairs at the Treasury Department, also said that India and its people share with the US an entrepreneurial spirit, a commitment to a vibrant private sector, and a record of economic growth built largely on domestic demand.
"Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi's sweeping election victory and economic reform platform have the potential to transform India -- by restoring higher growth and expanding economic opportunities in what would soon become the world's most populous country," he noted.
In recent months, there has been renewed vigour in the Indo-US bilateral ties.
Over the next two years, Sheets said more attention would be given to strengthen the US-India Economic and Financial Partnership.
Through the partnership, the US would support India in its growth and reform efforts and encourage the greater opening of India's economy to US firms, he said and added that such a scenario would be a "win-win proposition".
"We can create new growth and employment opportunities in the US by further opening this growing market for US exports, improving the climate for US investment in India, and levelling the playing field for US companies," as per remarks of Sheets released today by the Treasury Department.
Sheets made the remarks at an event organised by Brookings Institution.
According to him, faster growth, deeper financial markets, and greater openness to trade and foreign investment promise to raise incomes, reduce poverty, and bring many more Indians into the global middle class.
"Our commitment to the WTO was demonstrated in the recent breakthroughs with China regarding the Information Technology Agreement (ITA) and with India on implementing the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA).
"We are hopeful that these developments will give momentum to multilateral efforts," he said.

World Meteorological Organization: Earth headed towards warmest year on recordBy Jason Samenow December 3 Follow @capitalweather

2014 is on track to be the planet’s warmest year since records began in the late 1800s, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).  In a special report released today, aimed to inform the ongoing climate change negotiations in Lima, Peru, the WMO stressed that climate warming is clear and present.
“The provisional information for 2014 means that fourteen of the fifteen warmest years on record have all occurred in the 21st century,” said WMO Secretary-General Michel Jarraud. “There is no standstill in global warming.”
November and December need only “maintain the same tendency” as previous months for 2014 to surpass 2010, 2005 and 1998, the three warmest years on record, to date, the WMO said.
Record-setting ocean surface temperatures have fueled the global warmth. In November, NOAA reported ocean temperatures between May and October were the warmest on record by a wide margin. NOAA also noted that five of the those six months (July being the exception) were the warmest on record for the Earth overall, land and ocean combined.
“What we saw in 2014 is consistent with what we expect from a changing climate,” Jarraud said. “What is particularly unusual and alarming this year are the high temperatures of vast areas of the ocean surface, including in the northern hemisphere.”
The destined-to-be record warm year coincides with new highs in the levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases. In September, the WMO reported that atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide experienced its biggest year-to-year jump on record in 2013, rising 2.9 parts per million.
“Record-high greenhouse gas emissions and associated atmospheric concentrations are committing the planet to a much more uncertain and inhospitable future,” Jarraud said.
2014 may achieve record-warmth even without the official onset of an El Nino event, a warming of the equatorial Pacific ocean waters that injects heat into the atmosphere. However, El Nino has been on the brink of development since the summer and has likely given ocean and air temperatures an assist, even if not as pronounced as in 1998 and 2010, two of the other 3 warmest years on records

The WMO qualified its announcement that 2014 would be the warmest by noting “differences in the rankings of the warmest years are a matter of only a few hundredths of a degree, and that different data sets show slightly different rankings.”
In addition to documenting the global warmth, the WMO report highlighted weather extremes that have occurred around the world in 2014. In particular, it said, flooding has been prevalent around the world, including devastating events in the Balkans, Russia, and parts of South America during the first half of the year.
“Record-breaking heat combined with torrential rainfall and floods destroyed livelihoods and ruined lives,” Jarraud said.

The years top baby name list is out  and people are naming their kids after Shonda Rhimess charactersBy Elahe Izadi December 3 Follow @ElaheIzadi

Picking a name: It’s just one of those things you gotta do when you bring life into this world. But where can you find inspiration to give your baby a super cool name? I’m talking celebrity-Apple-Blue-Ivy-North level cool? Why, television, of course! And, specifically, the creations of TV producer-director-writer Shonda Rhimes.
Americans are increasingly turning to television, Netflix and sports for creative ideas for what to name their wee ones, according to online parenting source BabyCenter, which released its list of the  most popular baby names in 2014  this week. (Shameless plug: Why not newspapers? Pitching Elahe here as an excellent and unique baby name.)
The list, which combines similarly-spelled names, comes from data submitted to the site by the parents of more than 400,000 babies. The site’s 2013 baby name list included many of the same names on the  Social Security Administration’s 2013 list  of new baby names.
Television inspired 20 percent of names in the site’s database this year, with big increases in names ripped from Rhimes’s shows, such as Arizona from “Grey’s Anatomy” (a 35 percent jump) and Huck from “Scandal” (a 44 percent jump). The popularity of Callie (“Grey’s Anatomy”) increased 30 percent, and Fitzgerald (“Scandal”) jumped 56 percent. Granted, such names don’t come anywhere close to the top 100, but how many Arizonas do you know, really?
It was the year of the "binge-watching baby name," according to online parenting source BabyCenter, which released its list of the most popular baby names of 2014. Here are some of the names of TV characters that rose in popularity. (Tom LeGro/The Washington Post)
Then there’s the name Jeter, which increased 82 percent, the same year the baseball player Derek Jeter retired.
Even Idina showed up in the database this year, after being absent last year. Perhaps that baby girl was named after Idina Menzel, who sang the title track for the film “Frozen,” a song that America’s children cannot stop singing.
The top 10 names are mostly the tried-and-true that have been among top picks for years, although hints of television inspiration do lurk there, including Zoe (“House of Cards”) and Olivia (“Scandal”).
Here were the top girl names for 2014:

Stepfather of Michael Brown apologizes for rant after grand jury announcementBy Sarah Larimer December 3 Follow @slarimer
In this Nov. 24 photo, Louis Head, center, Michael Brown’s stepfather, and Brown’s mother, Lesley McSpadden, in sunglasses, react as they listen to the announcement that a grand jury decided not to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson. (Charlie Riedel/AP)
The stepfather of a Missouri teenager who was killed in a police shooting in August has apologized for comments he made after a grand jury decided not to indict the officer who fired the fatal shots.
“I was so angry and full of raw emotions, as so many others were, and granted, I screamed out words that I shouldn’t have screamed in the heat of the moment,” Louis Head said in a statement emailed to The Post. “It was wrong and I humbly apologize to all of those who read my pain and anger as a true desire for what I want for our community. It wasn’t.”
But to place blame solely on me for the conditions of our community, and country, after the grand jury decision goes way too far and is wrong as the decision itself. To declare a state of emergency and send a message of war, and not peace, before a grand jury decision was announced is also wrong. It set the stage for my outbursts.”
A grand jury last month declined to indict Darren Wilson, the former Ferguson police officer who shot 18-year-old Michael Brown on Aug. 9 . Brown was unarmed at the time of the shooting, and his death was followed by days of protests in the St. Louis suburb.
That unrest continued after the panel’s decision was announced on the evening of Nov. 24, and Head reacted by shouting “Burn this [expletive] down!” and “Burn this [expletive] down!” to a crowd that had gathered.

That night, police cruisers and buildings in the Ferguson area burned, as protesters flooded the streets. Stores were looted, and law enforcement officials blasted tear-gas canisters to contain the crowds. The Brown family, Missouri authorities, and President Obama had called for peace before the verdict was announced.
“In the end, I’ve lived in this community for a long time,” Head’s statement to CNN continued. “The last thing I truly wanted was to see it go up in flames. In spite of my frustration, it really hurt to see that.”
In an interview with Fox News, Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said that the department was investigating Head’s comments, and Sgt. Brian Schellman, a St. Louis County police spokesman,  told the Post-Dispatch that authorities were looking at his words as part of a larger investigation.
“We are pursuing (an investigation into) those comments, and there is a lot of discussion going on about that right now,” Jackson told Sean Hannity . “But I really can’t get into that at this time.”
Lesley McSpadden, Brown’s mother, has also been the subject of a police investigation recently. Earlier this year, Ferguson police looked into a fight involving McSpadden and other members of the Brown family. Pearlie Gordon, the mother-in-law of Brown’s father, told police that McSpadden confronted her while she sold “Justice for Mike Brown” items in a parking lot .
Wilson, 28, resigned from the Ferguson Police Department on Saturday .

Chennai
The initial capacity of the plant is 300 tonnes annually
Tata Chemicals will commission a pilot plant to make nutraceuticals in Chennai next month. The entry into the nutraceuticals business is part of its plan to increasingly focus on specialty and consumer products businesses.
Tata Chemicals had invested around Rs.50 crore to set up the pilot plant, which would initially have a capacity of 300 tonnes annually, and would scale up to 1,000 tonnes, company CFO P. K. Ghose told this correspondent.
Speaking on the sidelines of an event here to launch the commemorative book, Salt of the earth: the story of Tata Chemicals, which chronicles the company’s 75 years of existence, Mr. Ghose said the products to be made at the Chennai unit were oligosaccharides and polyols, the inputs used in the food industry.
The book, written by Philip Chacko and Christabelle Noronha, chronicles the company and the people who shaped it over 75 years of its existence.
“Today marks a historical milestone in the story of Tata Chemicals,” Tata Chemicals Managing Director R. Mukundan said. “The company has evolved from a commodities enterprise that dealt mainly in inorganic chemicals to providing solutions to end-customers. Tata Chemicals is today the second largest soda ash producer in the world and the largest salt manufacturer. We are completely committed to Indian agriculture with a ‘Farm to Fork’ approach.”
The company’s investments in nanotechnology with Swach water purifier and biotechnology with nutraceuticals to make probiotics and products promoting gut health were now bearing fruit, he said.

Why its suddenly trendy to be a RepublicanBy Aaron Blake December 3 Follow @aaronblakewp

The Marlins defeated the Nationals 7-6. (AP Photo/Lynne Sladky)
" Winning begets winning " -- it's a popular theory among athletes and gamblers. (The Miami Marlins and broke gamblers perhaps disagree.)
Turns out, it also kind of applies to politics.
Two polls conducted since the 2014 election -- from Pew and Gallup -- both show slightly more Americans identifying as Republicans or leaning Republican than before the election. Pew's party ID shifted from 50-37 Democrats (a 13-point gap) to 48-42 Democrats (a 6-point gap). And, leaners aside, the 27 percent who say they are Republicans (full stop) is the highest since 2006 .
Gallup , similarly, went from four points Democratic to one point Republican. And the 47 percent who identify as Republicans or Republican leaners is also one of the highest numbers since the mid-2000s.
(A third pollster, NBC/Wall Street Journal, showed no real change post-election.)
Going back through history, this isn't really surprising. Post-election party identification tends to tilt a little more toward the winners than it did prior to the election. Everyone likes -- or, perhaps more aptly, wants to feel like -- a winner once the results are tallied. So maybe the "independent" who just happens to always vote for Republicans suddenly claims to be officially on the red team.
Here's how that looks, courtesy of Gallup polling and the inimitable Philip Bump:
The only year in which this was not the case was in 2010, when party ID post-election was static, despite massive GOP gains. After the 1994, 1998, 2002 and 2006 midterms, though, that trend was intact, to varying extents (some of which, like the shifts in said election, were not terribly significant).
The bad news for the GOP, though: It doesn't usually last. The only real lasting change among all the years listed above was in 1994, when the Republican Revolution wrested control of Congress from Democrats for the first time in decades and effectively ended the long-standing "Conservative Coalition" between Republicans and conservative Southern Democrats.
The GOP does have some hope to retain its post-election gains this time around, though, especially given the Democratic brand has lost its longstanding superiority in the minds of Americans. If that continues, we might continue to see the two parties close to parity when it comes to party identification.
But even then, we've still got a very closely divided electorate. And, as mentioned above, plenty of those so-called "independents" are actually Independents In Name Only (IINOs).

Freak accident  gas leak  nearly 100 dead in 2 yrs  but no lessons learntWritten by Anil Sasi | Bhilai |
Posted: December 3, 2014 9:36 pm | Updated: December 3, 2014 9:42 pm
Around 6 pm on June 12, 53-year-old N K Katariya, a deputy general manager at Bhilai Steel plant and a father of two, was getting into his car for a short drive home when he saw his colleague B K Singh. Like Katariya, Singh, another DGM at the water supply department of the steel plant, was winding up work that evening when he was informed about a rupture on the main header pipe of the plant’s pump house, which supplied water to the gas cleaning plant of the blast furnaces.
Katariya dropped his bag and joined Singh in rushing across, as any flooding would endanger the blast furnaces and may force a shutdown at the steel plant, a flagship unit of state-owned Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL). The two managers were joined by half a dozen other employees.
At the pump house, the team was oblivious to early indication of trouble — pigeons were falling in droves from their perches above the facility. As the water supply to the gas cleaning plant had been stopped to prevent flooding, there was a sudden drop in pressure, forcing gas from the blast furnace scrubbers to enter the pipeline. When the pipeline ruptured, there was a surge of a deadly cocktail of methane and the colourless and odourless carbon monoxide. In a matter of minutes, the team working on the line started dropping one by one.
The leakage of carbon monoxide at the plant affected 36 people, of which five, including Katariya and Singh, died during treatment, while the body of Vikas Verma — a 24-year-old contract worker — was found 30 feet down in the pump site after the water was drained.
The casualties could have been higher, had it not been for a fortuitous event. Durg Collector R Shangeetha, who was just 12 days into her job when the accident happened, told The Indian Express that there was a CISF mock drill happening near the plant around the time of the accident, so the jawans managed to carry the 36 people in time to the hospital.
SAIL described it as a “freak accident”, the first such event in 50 years. But hardly any lessons seem to have been learnt by India’s flagship firms. Just three days later, on June 16, two engineers of a private firm — SMS Seimag India Ltd — died of suspected gas leak at the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, a unit of state-owned steel company Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd (RINL). Preliminary reports attributed the reason to suspected carbon monoxide poisoning.
In fact, if just the steel sector were to be considered, across the two flagship state-owned steel firms — SAIL and RINL — nearly 100 workmen have died in a series of accidents in the two-year period till July 2014. The biggest single event was in June 2012, when over a dozen employees, including some senior executives, died at an accident in RINL’s Visakhapatnam plant.
Consider these cases in just this year:

A new controversy may be brewing for the NDA government as the Solicitor General of India on Wednesday sought to argue on behalf of the Special Investigation Team (SIT) in the Supreme Court in the black money case, amid allegation of “conflict of interest” by petitioner Ram Jethmalani.
In a prelude to what can blow into a full-fledged battle of wits, a Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice of India H L Dattu in fact denied Solicitor General Ranjit Kumar permission to argue without showing a formal letter of his engagement by the SIT and a due approval by the competent authority in the government.
Senior advocate Anil Divan, who appeared for petitioner Ram Jethmalani, described it as a “clear case of conflict of interest” and questioned how a top law officer of the government could appear for the SIT, which has been tasked with scrutinising the role of the Centre in bringing back black money stashed abroad.
“This is clear conflict of interest. How can a law officer for the union of India appear for SIT? SIT is an independent party in the case and has been set up on the orders of the court,” said Divan, as SG Kumar sought the court’s permission to argue on behalf of the SIT.
Divan said he was “surprised” that Kumar was appearing for the SIT since the previous two orders of the court stated that the SG was appearing for the government, along with Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi.
Kumar replied that he was representing the SIT even on the last date and that this could be a “mistake” or a “typographical error” if the court order recorded that he was appearing for the government. Divan, however, pointed out that he has not seen Kumar’s vakalatnama in the case papers, nor any other letter authorising the law officer to argue for the SIT.
At this, the bench, also comprising Justices Madan B Lokur and A K Sikri, asked Kumar to show the relevant letter authorising him to appear for the SIT but the SG said he did not have the letter with him at the moment.
“Then you should not argue. You should sit down. Since there is an objection from the other side, we cannot let you appear without a document authorising you to appear,” retorted the bench, forcing the second senior-most law officer of the government to sit down in his chair.
Meanwhile, on being asked, AG Rohatgi assured the bench that nobody will go scot-free from prosecution in an income tax case on account of a technical ground that the six-year period of limitation for prosecution would expire on March 31, 2015. Divan had sought directives to the Centre to ensure a case is not frustrated due to expiry of the limitation period.
“We are confident that the central government will complete the proceedings relating to income tax on or before March 31, 2015. If on account of any reason, it cannot be continued…

CJI sets up Social Justice Bench for public interest casesWritten by Utkarsh Anand | New Delhi |

Resolute that people’s voices never go unheard before the highest court of the land, Chief Justice of India H L Dattu has set up a special bench, christened “Social Justice Bench”, to specifically deal with the issues troubling a common man in everyday life. This is the first time the Supreme Court will have a dedicated bench to hear cases pertaining to public interest and all fresh PILs may be heard by the new bench from now. Currently, such cases are scattered over different benches.
This is the first time the Supreme Court will have a dedicated bench to hear cases pertaining to public interest and all fresh PILs may be heard by the new bench from now. Currently, such cases are scattered over different benches.
Notifying the constitution of a two-judge bench on Wednesday, the CJI, through an official note, expressed concern over pendency of several cases in the Supreme Court without a proper hearing.
Cases that relate to problems in society and those which have a direct impact on the rights of the people are the areas where the constitutional mechanism has to play a proactive role so as to meet the goals of the Constitution, according to the note.
“Honb’le the Chief Justice of India is of the view that these cases shall be given a specialised approach for their early disposal so that the masses will realise the fruits of the rights provided to them by the constitutional text,” stated the note, adding the CJI’s order aimed at securing social justice — one of the ideals of the Constitution.
Secretary General VSR Avadhani told The Indian Express that the CJI has directed that the Social Justice Bench would start functioning from December 12. The new bench will devise a procedure to expeditiously deal with the issues and would continue to sit on every working Friday at 2 pm to monitor the implementation of its directions to authorities concerned.
Justice Madan B Lokur and Justice Uday U Lalit would comprise the bench, which will hear not only the pending cases but also all the fresh matters on the pertinent issues. Out of around 200 such cases pending in the court, 65 cases have been identified to begin with and the cases, already pending before other benches, may get transferred to the special bench on the directions of the CJI.
Release of surplus food grains for people affected by natural calamities after framing a comprehensive scheme for public distribution, rehabilitation of sex workers, prevention of untimely death of pregnant women and children due to malnourishment or lack of medical care, hygienic mid-day meal, shelter homes for the destitute and homeless and education for the children are illustrations of the kind of cases that the new bench would take up.

Faced with high prices for new cars, more car shoppers in November turned to the used-car market.
Some of the biggest action came on so-called "certified pre-owned vehicles" — late-model vehicles checked over by dealers and carrying a brand warranty — which posted a 21% increase in the amount that customers actually paid for the cars compared to the same month last year, reports CNW Research.
The average certified used car went for $16,130.
Certified pre-owned models are considered good alternatives to new cars, since they are generally fresh from rental car or corporate fleets, usually 3 years old or younger and backed by a warranty.
Prices for them remain high because "dealers struggle to get enough of them on the lot," says Alec Gutierrez, senior analyst for Kelley Blue Book.
Certified used-car unit sales are up 10% for the first 10 months of the year compared to last year, says Tom Webb, chief economist for Manheim, a wholesale auction house for used cars. There have been record sales of them in each of the past three years and, he says, the trend is almost assuredly going to continue for 2014.
"The programs have been marketed well," Webb says. "What people are buying is peace  of mind."
Overall, through the first 11 months of the year, the number of used cars sold is virtually unchanged from the same period a year ago, CNW says, which makes activity on certified used cars all the more impressive.
However, they are just one piece of a used-car market in November that was strong both in activity and price, he says.
Overall transaction prices for used cars are up 15% this year when sales both through dealers and private parties are taken into account.
As the economy continues to gain strength, low-mileage pickup trucks have been among the strongest performers, commanding high prices at auction because of their short supply. Most are work trucks, needed by those in construction and other workers.
"These trucks are doing really, really well" in the used market, says KBB's Gutierrez.
SUV sales are also strong and, by contrast, low gas prices are turning midsize and small sedans into relative bargains.
Just as some dealers are having to apply discounts to some new cars to move them off the lot, the savings are cascading into the used market. And the price softness has been driven not only by gas, but by more competition, as well.
Yet "the market is incredibly strong" for all used cars, Gutierrez adds.

Pres. Obama: Will not perpetuate prior immigration system
Kim Kardashian may not have broken the Internet  but Psys Gangham Style literally just didBy Caitlin Dewey December 3 Follow @caitlindewey
Psy in New York in 2012 (John Carucci/AP)
“Gangnam Style,” the K-pop sensation that basically owned 2012, has been viewed so many millions of times that, two years later, YouTube’s view counter literally broke trying to tally it.
The site is upgrading that tool as a result, a spokesperson wrote on YouTube’s Google+ page . That means that in the future, YouTube will be able to accommodate videos with more than 2.147 billion views — which was, previously, the most views YouTube imagined a video could ever receive.
But that seems kind of weird and arbitrary, right? There are more than 7 billion people on the planet, and only 40 percent of them currently use the Internet, and more are signing on every day — YouTube’s view potential seems, if not limitless, at least very large. Why even set a view count ceiling? Why does this thing exist?
The short answer: MATH. (And if you never envisioned a world where “Gangnam Style” could teach you something on that subject, allow me to remind you that this is the Internet.)
We tend to think of numbers as infinite things — which of course, they are. In grade school, when you made number lines, you probably put 0 in the middle and stretched numbers going to infinity on the right and left.
That’s theoretical, though. In practice, “infinity” is kind of an unmanageable concept, even for computers — they don’t have infinite memory, after all. So, when we talk about how high computers can count, we don’t talk about “infinity on either side.” Instead, we talk about how many numbers registries can store, based on how it codes and displays them.
This is sort of complicated, so we won’t get into it too deep. But basically, YouTube codes its view count as a signed 32-bit integer, which means (a) it stores numbers as a string of 32 0s and 1s, with one of those slots reserved for determining if it’s a positive or negative number, (b) it can only count up to 2^(32-1), or 2,147,483,648, and (c) if it reaches that point, instead of counting to the next positive number, it will switch into negative integers. In terms of YouTube’s display, that would probably mean showing a view count of -2,147,483,647, which of course makes no sense.
This is, incidentally, a pretty big problem — and not just for YouTube.
A lot of data is stored or calculated as a signed 32-bit integer, which means a lot of things “max out” at 2,147,483,647. There are a number of video games, for instance, that calculate things this way. More pressingly, the IP system that’s been used since the 1980s only allows for 2^32 IP addresses, or roughly 4.3 billion — a number we’re closing in on, particularly as everything from our cars to coffee machines connect to the “Internet of things.” (This has, as you might guess, prompted a move to a new system .)
A lot of computer systems also store the date as a signed 32-bit integer, with each new tick to the right in the number line representing a second since Jan. 1, 1970. On Jan. 19, 2038 at 3:14:08 UTC, that second count will hit 2,147,483,647 — which means the date will reset. To 1901. (This is called the “Year 2038 Problem,” and its pretty analogous to Y2K.)
An illustration of the “Year 2038 problem.” Watch for when that bottom date hits 03:13:08. (Wikipedia)
In all of these cases, of course, the engineers who designed these systems have been limited by the storage and the systems they’re working with. But YouTube intimates that there’s something else going on here, as well: a failure to even imagine a use for numbers so big. (“We never thought a video would be watched in numbers greater than a 32-bit integer … but that was before we met PSY,” the company said. )
Funnily enough, that’s not a new problem. In fact, it’s been the curse of 2,147,483,647 almost since the number was proven by Leonhard Euler in 1772.
“[It] is the greatest perfect number known at present, and probably the greatest that ever will be discovered,” the mathematician Peter Barlow wrote in 1811 , “for as they are merely curious, without being useful, it is not likely that any person will attempt to find one beyond it.”
He was proved wrong in 1876, and again in 1883. Which perhaps goes to show that — where human curiosity is concerned, at least! — we may not want to set upward limits.

yes, you are right it`s f.v. Rs.1 is not from split. but original f.v. 10 was reduced to rs.1 and balance rs.9 was written off with losses. so shareholders get only one share of rs 1 in exchange of one share of rs.10

you havent said about your time horizon. i know nothing about long term. regarding medium term just wait for above 178 level or 161 level.( after testing, if bounce back). if you want to go short, please wait another 2-3 trading sessions. chart pattern shows incertainty.
