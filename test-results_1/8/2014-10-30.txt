Brace Yourself: Ugg Season May Be Even Bigger Than Usual This YearBrace Yourself: Ugg Season May Be Even Bigger Than Usual This Year

Each year as the temperature dips, women across the country turn to their closets and dig their Ugg boots out of hibernation. Others head to stores to score a pair of the squat sheepskin booties in preparation for a chilly winter.
This year the Ugg frenzy may be even bigger than usual. Sales at the Ugg brand rose nearly 24 percent last quarter to $417 million, compared to $337 million for the same period the year prior, parent company Deckers reported Thursday. The spike was due to higher wholesale sales, online sales and new retail store openings worldwide.
And now, Ugg is about to enter its prime season.
"With temperatures turning cold in recent weeks, sell-through of weather boots and classics have gained pace across the majority of our markets," Deckers chief executive Angel Martinez said on a conference call with analysts on Thursday.
Ugg's upcoming product lines are "as compelling as we have ever seen for the company," Sam Poser, an analyst at Sterne Agee, wrote in a note to clients on Friday. He added that Ugg's reaping the benefits of favorable fashion trends, as shoppers search the aisles for comfy clothes like stretchy leggings and oversized sweaters.
However Ugg's holidays turn out, "Ugg Season" will remain. The annual donning of the Uggs has even made its way into memes, like " Girls be like."
Meanwhile, Ugg's plan to diversify its offerings seems to be working. Ugg is now selling more items that aren't dependent on cold weather. It launched a home goods line in October, offering an assortment of sheepskin area rugs, knit pillows and floor poufs. There's also Ugg's loungewear line, a casual clothing label. On the call, Martinez said that Ugg's home and loungewear businesses are still "small but burgeoning" and early results have been "very strong." Ugg will be pushing both lines hard through the holidays.
In an attempt to tell customers Ugg sells more than just  shearling boots, the brand launched an advertising campaign in August with the tagline "THIS IS UGG," featuring sketch artist Langley Fox Hemingway and New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.
But until those lines get bigger, Ugg remains a slave to the elements. According to a report from Nomura Securities, Deckers is the best example of a company that's exposed to weather risk, something it could never hope to control. So far, the climate has treated Deckers, which also owns footwear brands Teva and Sanuk, quite well this year.
"Despite the mild weather conditions over the last two winters, this year was more seasonably cool and snowy in many parts of the U.S., which had a substantially large impact on companies with a great deal of cold weather product including Deckers," Nomura analyst Bob Drbul wrote in the report.

Buoyed by Centre’s emphasis on e-governance, Make in India campaign
Mumbai, October 27:  
Domestic businesses of Indian IT companies appear to have got a shot in the armwith the Modi Government’s focus on technology and its steps to reduce the digital divide.
For the first time in several quarters, the India-focused units of Tata Consultancy Services, Wipro and Zensar Technologies have grown by 4-25 per cent sequentially in the three months ended September 30.
The jump in domestic business could be attributed to the overall buoyancy in the market coupled with the Centre’s push on delivering effective governance through technology.
“If you look at India in particular, I am very happy to state that it has performed well this quarter, on the base of positive growth last quarter. The deal pipeline in India is also looking good. We are seeing spending, and we are seeing a lot of strategic programmes being initiated,” N Chandrasekaran, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of TCS, recently said in a conference call with analysts.
TCS recorded a 9 per cent rise in Q2 revenue from India.
Turning the tide
The India business for most IT companies had taken a major hit last year, as Government IT spending had slowed down ahead of the 2014 General elections. However, the tide seems to have turned with the new government initiating new automation initiatives. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s focus on ‘Digital India’, ‘Make in India’ and ‘100 smart cities’ also appear to have added to the optimism.
Speaking to BusinessLine, Ganesh Natarajan, CEO of Zensar Technologies, said: “I am very bullish on the India market because of the general sentiment at present, all of which is having a positive effect on private-sector IT spends. The whole management of e-governance deals is becoming very professional, as streamlining of government processes is happening in a big way.’’
Zensar recorded a 25 per cent rise in sequential revenue from India, albeit on a small base in Q2. Its larger peer Wipro has also seen an uptick in revenue from India based-customers.
Going forward, there is a strong probability of companies wanting to increase their exposure to the India market, say analysts.
A case in point is Bangalore-based Mindtree, which had scaled down its interests in the domestic market over the last two to three years.
An official said the company had stopped hunting for work on a voluntary basis, and had instead chosen to focus on servicing global clients in India.
“We see a need to re-evaluate this strategy in the next 6-12 months, given the way in which the Government is articulating its priorities with regards to digital India and reducing the digital divide,” said KK Natarajan, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of Mindtree.

The Hypocrisy of Plastic Surgeryreddit
We can pretend that we pity Renee Zellweger for falling prey to society's expectations about women and aging, and condemn her for being so vain, but studies show that more, not fewer, people are undergoing plastic surgery. Botox is up. Fillers are up. And women and men are starting younger, too, not even willing to wait and see how well or not they age, but encouraged by doctors who promise better results if such work is done "preventatively." In the best cases, the argument often goes, no one will even know you've done anything at all.
And that, of course, is key to the discussion about plastic surgery, Zellweger's or anyone else's. More than ever, as a culture we accept it. We just don't want to know about it.
Consider that the most obvious examples of plastic surgery are also the ones that land on the lists of the most egregious. Bruce Jenner. Melanie Griffith. Lara Flynn Boyle. Such examples often signify the end of a career. Dirty Dancing actress Jennifer Grey has been called out for years as the poster child for bad plastic surgery after undergoing a nose job that altered her appearance so drastically that it removed any sense of her character. (Indeed, nearly 30 years after the film that made her famous, she is still best known as "Dirty Dancing actress Jennifer Grey.") Every time a new example (or a new face) pops up, we lament society's expectations regarding aging and beauty, before condemning the celebrity in question for falling prey to those expectations.
But countless celebrities undergo plastic surgery and cosmetic enhancements every year. Certain who are praised for their good looks have likely had work done, if very good work -- Angelina Jolie, Blake Lively, Gwen Stefani, Kim Kardashian -- while others, like Jennifer Aniston and Seth Rogen, have altered their appearance through significant weight loss. They all look great, and are celebrated as such on magazine covers, fashion spreads, red carpet photos. When it's good -- that is, when we can't tell: Has she? Or hasn't she? -- we prefer to say that a celebrity "looks good for her age," "looks fit at 50," or some other half-truth that shades the real one.
Which, of course, is that it's the majority undergoing some sort of procedure. Not the minority. But because we're reluctant to talk about our own vanity-driven alterations, we tend to want to dismiss and condemn those of others. The real objection to Zellweger's new face isn't that she has one. The objection is that we can't pretend it didn't happen. Indeed, in a review of Diehard 4, praise of Bruce Willis included the fact that he had "no obviously discernible plastic surgery to mess up his face like Sly Stallone or Michael Douglas." It's hard to tell what author Nikki Finke found worse: the "messed up faces" or that such procedures were so obvious.
Here's the truth: Celebrities are vain. So are millions of the rest of us. This isn't even a particularly difficult truth, because there is nothing wrong with vanity. Vanity is healthy. It is natural. It doesn't signify a culture being overrun by superficiality. In fact, vanity is part of developing good self-esteem and, as we know, self-esteem is important.
And yet every time a celebrity, or perhaps even a friend, displays an overt sense of vanity, we lash out. Why did you do that to yourself? You looked great as you were. We pretend we're appalled. But if we're honest, it's more that we're judgmental, picking and choosing which sort of superficiality is acceptable to us on any given day. And we're scared of, well, looking vanity in the face. For example: Bruce Jenner is very definitely not celebrated, and I can't help but wonder: If the work he's plainly had done had made him better-looking, would someone like Jimmy Fallon comment on Jenner's "100 percent recyclable" goods?
Therein lies the hypocrisy of all the backlash directed at Zellweger -- or Jenner or Meg Ryan or Pamela Anderson -- and the real trouble with all the talk surrounding anyone's new or different appearance. We make it about them, when it's all about us. When we react to a celebrity's new face, we're reacting to its obviousness, its unavoidability. Changes that are "too obvious" make us uncomfortable in their display of vanity, because it's the exact sort of vanity we try to keep to ourselves. When someone like, say, Sandra Bullock turns up looking, at 50, remarkably refreshed, though, it's easier to turn the other cheek. But why? "Good" plastic surgery doesn't eliminate the vanity. It does, however, make it easier to ignore our own.

Apple Pay  CurrentC  and the Normalization of Credit/Debtreddit
How do payment technologies like Apple Pay, CurrentC, and credit cards affect our lives as consumers?
Paying for stuff has just gotten easier with Apple Pay - or so it seems. Apply Pay is a wireless payment system that lets owners of iPhone 6 pay for goods at retailers with wireless payment terminals. Users put their phones near the payment terminals, put their thumbs on the Touch ID button, and the transaction is complete.
This week, however, some US retailers have started disabling their NFC systems to prevent people from using Apple Pay, Google Wallet or any other NFC based payment system. These retailers promote their own payment system Called CurrentC. CurrentC relies on QR code scanning to process a consumer's payment. Payments are not linked to a credit card account but pulled automatically from the bank account linked to the user's account via Automatic Clearing House (ACH) transactions.
For most commentators, Apple Pay is a completely seamless, intuitive, and unobtrusive innovation that empowers consumers. CurrentC, on the other hand, is viewed as just another clunky, entirely unethical and anti-competitive consumer nightmare. Consider tech blogger John Gruber :
"What Apple gets and what no one else in the industry does is that using your mobile device for payments will only work if it's far easier and better than using a credit card. With CurrentC, you'll have to unlock your phone, launch their app, point your camera at a QR code, and wait. With Apple Pay, you just take out your phone and put your thumb on the Touch ID sensor."
However, arguments such as John Gruber's not only reinforce the US cultural legacy of abundance and related idealizations of technology as an enabler of consumer freedom. They also easily ignore how existing patterns of power relationships in the US financial system have affected American society on a deeper sociological level.
With upwards of 522 million Visa cards and 551 million MasterCards in circulation in 2013 , Visa and MasterCard have created an infrastructural monopoly. This duopolistic Visa-Mastercard hegemony has not only created a huge invisible tax on the economy of around $50 billion a year (Nielsen). It has also contributed to what consumer researchers Lisa Peñaloza and Michelle Barnhart call "the normalization of credit/debt" among American middle class consumers (Journal of Consumer Research).
From this perspective, financial instruments such as credit cards, pay day loans, loans on car titles, loans on income tax refunds, and subprime mortgages have led to a profound shift in consumers' self-understandings as financial decision makers. Whereas previous generations of Americans viewed credit/debt as an invitation to exercise self-discipline and as a threat, contemporary American consumers are actively encouraged to view credit as a way to be independent, to express freedom, to indulge in consumption, and to show patriotism.
In this climate, many consumers have learned to successfully leverage credit cards provided to them by firms in ways that benefit each. However, the necessity to have credit to consume normally and the idea that taking significant financial risks (even if one lacks the funds) is not a sign of foolishness but rather a great way to help keep the economy afloat and to showcase one's patriotism and entrepreneurial mindset have also made credit/debt matters of national security that threaten families and firms and jeopardize the national economy.
Analyses of payment systems like Apple Pay or CurrentC should take these larger sociological dynamics into account. Consumer researchers Peñaloza and Barnhart, for one, "rally firms to more proactively and evenly institute feedback to consumers and to do so prior to their constitution of the punished consuming subject position."
In this light, CurrentC may not only help merchants avoid paying the approximately 2 to 3 percent fee levied by credit card companies. Linking payments to a debit account may also be a feedback mechanism that socializes consumers into a new payment ethos that emphasizes risk-avoidance and that has the potential to reduce consumer vulnerabilities especially during life transitions such as college, marriage, divorce, children, illness, retirement, and job loss.

JMB threat real and serious  Tarun Gogoi tells NarendraModiPM Narendra Modi with Chief Minister of Assam, Tarun Gogoi at a meeting in New Delhi on Wednesday. (Source: PTI)
Written by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati | Posted: October 29, 2014 8:55 pm
Even as the Assam Police and NIA have intensified search for more persons in West Bengal and Assam who could be linked to the Jamatul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) in the aftermath of the Burdwan blast, Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi on Wednesday told Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi and said the JMB threat to the state was “real and serious.”
“Of late Assam appears to have been targeted by fundamentalist organizations like Al Qaeda. Some operatives having links with Jamatul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) were recently arrested in Assam. We feel that the threat is real and serious and such organizations may find support among the misguided and disaffected elements in the state,” Gogoi said in a memorandum he handed over to the PM on Wednesday.
Taking up the problem of militancy and threat from fundamentalist organizations, Gogoi also made a plea to Modi to take up the matter with neighbouring countries at appropriate levels for sharing of intelligence and coordinated action.
“There should be similar mechanism at interstate level for West Bengal and North Eastern States so that issues of jurisdiction do not come in the way of dealing with insurgency and militancy,” he said. It was, therefore, important that more sophisticated measures were taken to check, contain and curb such organizations and their activities through proper intelligence sharing and surveillance, Gogoi said.
The Assam Police had earlier this month arrested six persons from different villages in Barpeta district in connection with the Burdwan blast where two JMB activists were killed. The six persons were arrested after the police found there involvement with the JMB activists related to the Burdwan incident.

Former IPL commissioner Lalit Modi attacks Rajasthan CM Vasundhara Raje and hercoterie— Lalit Kumar Modi (@LalitKModi) October 29, 2014
People in #rajasthan are #fedup of #remote control politics. Best is to bring in #stalwart #om #mathur who will be #hands on #cm at least
— Lalit Kumar Modi (@LalitKModi) October 29, 2014
“Like in centre cleanup happened…Vasundhara BJP needs to show the same strength and start cleanup within her coterie…crooks all around… Khamthans and bhardwaj was not what people voted for (sic),” his tweets said.
Though the attacks were directly made at Dhirendra Kamthan, Officer on Special Duty to CM, and Mahendra Bhardwaj, Press Advisor to CM, they were clearly targeted at Raje as both Kamthan and Bhardwaj were hand-picked by her. Kamthan has been working with Raje for over 20 years while Bhardwaj has served as Raje’s media advisor since her first term as CM in 2003 and stayed by her side even after she was voted out of power in 2008.
Modi has been privy to Raje’s working style in her previous term when the duo got along famously. However over the years as Modi ran into the BJP central leadership (read Arun Jaitley), Raje too had to keep her distance from him. Recently when BJP minority cell leader Amin Pathan turned Modi out from the Rajasthan Cricket Association by calling an emergency meeting and took over as acting RCA president, Modi received no support from Raje. Instead in political circles, it was heard that Pathan made the move with Raje’s consent.
Officials in the government maintained that Modi is attacking the Raje government because he expects support in the RCA issue. Kamthan and Bhardwaj are the only two officials who have been brought on board by the CM and are not government servants and are therefore considered easy targets.
Kamthan and Bhardwaj refused to comment on the issue.
Modi’s backing of senior BJP leader Om Mathur caused a flutter in the political circle. Mathur, who has been Raje’s arch rival and critic, has been entrusted with considerable responsibility by the party lately as he led BJP in the recent assembly polls in Maharashtra.
Raje, who is usually active on Twitter, did not respond to the attacks.
 

Unearthing black money can bring $30 bn windfall for Indias forex reserves:BofAPrint
New Delhi | Posted: October 29, 2014 10:07 pm
The unearthing of capital flight of “black” money Indians have allegedly stashed away in Swiss banks could add USD 30 billion to the country’s forex reserves, says a Bank of America Merrill Lynch report.
According to the global financial services major, though there would not be any immediate forex impact given the legal issues involved, it could add USD 30-35 billion to the forex reserves over time.
BofA-ML has worked with an estimate of capital flight of about USD 200 billion based on a recent research study.
According to the study, Raghbendra Jha and Duc Nguyen Truong, of Australian National University, estimated total capital flight of more than USD 186 billion during 1998-2012.
“If even half of this is unearthed, it could add USD 30-35 billion (three to four months of current import cover) to forex reserves over time,” BofA-ML said in a research note today.
The Centre today placed a list of names of 627 Indian account holders in HSBC bank, Geneva in black money case before the Supreme Court which asked SIT to go through the list and take appropriate action in accordance with law.
A bench headed by Chief Justice H L Dattu did not open the sealed envelope containing the names placed by the Centre and said that it would be opened only by the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team (SIT).
It asked the SIT to submit status report of its probe by November-end.
Placing the documents before the bench, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi said details of account holders are of year 2006 which were supplied by the French government to the Centre in 2011.
The report further noted that rupee is expected to hold Rs 58-62/USD and BofA-ML’s Asia forex strategist, Adarsh Sinha, forecasts INR to be at Rs 61/USD in December.

Government relaxes FDI norms for construction  real estatesectorPrint
By: PTI | New Delhi | Posted: October 29, 2014 10:00 pm
In a boost to cash-starved real estate industry, the Narendra Modi government today relaxed rules for FDI in the construction sector by reducing minimum built-up area as well as capital requirement and easing the exit norms.
The proposal to amend the FDI policy in construction development sector was approved by the Union Cabinet.
In view of depleting FDI inflow in construction and real estate sector in last couple of years, the Cabinet decided to reduce the minimum floor area to 20,000 sq mt from the earlier 50,000 sq mt. It also brought down the minimum capital requirement to USD 5 million from USD 10 million.
In case of development of serviced plots, the condition of minimum land of 10 hectares has been completely removed, an official statement said.
Although 100 per cent foreign direct investment was allowed in townships, housing and built-up infrastructure and construction developments since 2005, the government had imposed certain conditions.
“These measures are expected to result in enhanced inflows into the construction development sector… It is likely to attract investments in new areas and encourage development of plots for serviced housing given the shortage of land in and around urban agglomerations as well as the high cost of land.
“The measure is also expected to result in creation of much needed low cost affordable housing in the country and development of smart cities,” the statement said.
Although the Cabinet has not reduced the 3-year lock-in period, it has permitted foreign investors to exit on project completion or 3 years from the date of final investment subject to the development of trunk infrastructure.
The government said the relaxation was necessary as FDI inflows in the sector, which witnessed a steady rise during 2006-07 and 2009-10, have started declining.
“To step up investment in construction development with its backward and forward linkages for many other sectors of the economy, it is felt that some liberalisation and rationalisation of the FDI policy…could be the necessary catalyst to give a boost to the sector,” it added.
Between April 2000 and August 2014, the construction sector received FDI worth USD 23.75 billion or 10 per cent of the total FDI attracted by India during the period.
Realtors apex body CREDAI president C Shekar Reddy said it would help developers get an alternative route of funding for their projects.
The Cabinet decision amending the existing FDI policy is in line with the Budget 2014-15 announcement.
To boost the development of affordable homes, the Cabinet exempted the conditions of minimum floor area as well as capital requirement if an investee/joint venture companies commit at least 30 per cent of the total project cost for low-cost housing.
The real estate sector has been facing a slowdown since last 2-3 years, leading to liquidity crunch and huge delays in completion of housing as well as commercial projects.
The government said the investment in construction and real estate sector has a multiplier effect on the economy by way of infrastructure creation and employment generation.
The move will help create demand for products of related industries like cement and steel.

Dont sensationalise to hit headlines: Jaitley toCAGAddressing an annual conference of the CAG, Jaitley said that Auditor should be conscious of the fact that he is reviewing a decision that has already been taken.
By: Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: October 29, 2014 9:36 pm
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Tuesday asked the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) not to sensationalise its findings to make headlines – echoing a view that the Congress had voiced earlier after huge notional losses were projected in reports on the 2G and coal blocks allocation cases.
Addressing an annual conference of the CAG, Jaitley said, “Auditor should be conscious of the fact that he is reviewing a decision that has already been taken. Have the fair procedures been followed? He doesn’t have to sensationalise. He doesn’t have to get into the headlines.”
He said an auditor has to be “active… but activism and restraint are always the two sides of the same coin.” Jaitley said an auditor “has to scrutinise thoroughly the decision-making process. He has to necessarily eliminate the possibility of any form of nepotism.”
Jaitley also said an auditor must be able to distinguish between a wrong decision and a corrupt one. “If he finds it (the decision) is a corrupt view, then the level of discretion he exercises in commenting has to be entirely different,” he said.
He said the auditor must take “a more liberal approach” when confronted with multiple views. “Because let us also not forget that when we live in a society, which by temperament, having learnt the hard way the last few years, has become an over suspicious society… our job is not to convert the public opinion into a kind of a lynch mob,” said Jaitley.
“To create rationality in the reviewing process we spare a decision which palpably looks arbitrary, a decision which is not fair, a decision which is not honest and we leave some element of benefit of doubt for a decision where two possible views are possible. But we can always lay down the guidelines as far as the future is concerned,” he said.
“Both in the spectrum and coal cases, we have learnt that natural resources and their allotment is not the prerogative of the state to choose methodology… valuable resources cannot be allocated without value being realised,” he said. The CAG reports on 2G and coal blocks cases projected notional losses to the tune of Rs 1.76 lakh crore and Rs.1.84 lakh crore respectively.
On Monday, Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee Chairman and senior Congress leader K V Thomas too had said at the conference that the auditor should restrict audits to financial impropriety and not come out with “astronomical” figures of notional losses.

Digital divide exacerbates US inequalityDigital divide exacerbates US inequality
David Crow in New York
The majority of families in some of the US’s poorest cities do not have a broadband connection, according to a Financial Times analysis of official data that shows how the “digital divide” is exacerbating inequality in the world’s biggest economy.
US cities that have become synonymous with urban decay, such as Detroit and Flint in Michigan and Macon in Georgia, have household broadband subscription rates of less than 50 per cent, according to the US Census Bureau data. The median household income in all three is less than $25,000 a year.

Rural-urban broadband divide narrows
Barack Obama has pledged to close the digital divide, and in 2010 the president unveiled a national broadband plan with the aim of giving “every American affordable access to robust broadband” by 2020.
But the new figures from the Census Bureau , which collected data on internet use at a sub-state level for the first time last year, show how hard it will be to hit that target in the next five years. There are still 31m households in the US without a home or mobile broadband subscription.
Susan Crawford, who served as Mr Obama’s special assistant for technology and innovation in 2009, warned: “we are creating two Americas where the wealthy have access . . . while others are left on a bike path, unable to join in the social and economic benefits that the internet brings”.
It had been thought that the rural make-up of much of the US was the main factor in a national broadband subscription rate that is just 73.4 per cent, behind other developed nations such as the UK and Germany, which have rates of 88 per cent. About 67 per cent of households in rural areas have broadband internet service, compared to 75 per cent of urban households.
But the new Census Bureau statistics show a huge disparity among US cities and towns, with a gap of 65 percentage points between those with the highest and lowest subscription rates.
The problem is most acute in urban areas where the typical cost for the most basic broadband packages is too expensive for some. The OECD ranks the US 30th out of 33 countries for affordability, with an average price of $44 a month, compared with $26 for the UK., $22 for Greece and $16 for South Korea, based on speeds of 2.5 Mbps.
The top of the US league table is dominated by prosperous growing towns such as Flower Mound in Dallas-Fort Worth and Timberwood Park outside San Antonio, which have broadband subscription rates of 95 per cent. The pair have median household incomes of $117,000 and $104,000 respectively. The rates in San Francisco and New York are 82 per cent and 74 per cent.
There is a very strong correlation with race and income. Just 45 per cent of households with an income of less than $20,000 a year have broadband whereas the rate for those earning $75,000 or more is 91 per cent. About a third of African American and Hispanic households are unconnected compared to 20 per cent for white households and 10 per cent for Asian households.

Adani Enterprises Hires Consultant for $6.2 Billion Australia Coal Project
Reuters | Updated On: October 29, 2014 09:31 (IST)
Aviation Regulator Acts Tough Against Troubled SpiceJet: Report
Melbourne: Adani Enterprises has hired consulting firm Parsons Brinckerhoff to manage contract reviews for its long-delayed A$7 billion ($6.2 billion) coal mine, rail and port project as it looks to start production by the end of 2017.
Adani said on Wednesday the consultant would provide quality control and audit services for engineering, procurement and construction contracts, in the latest sign Adani is trying to push ahead with a mine it originally aimed to open this year.
With coal prices at five-year lows and up to a third of all Australian production running at a loss, much bigger companies than Adani, like BHP Billiton and Glencore, have shelved new coal projects in Australia.
Adani earlier this year lined up South Korea's POSCO Engineering & Construction Co Ltd to build the rail line for the Carmichael mine and bought out royalty rights on the coal from Linc Energy.
"We are well placed to commence construction in the first quarter of 2015 in line with our guidance of first coal in 2017," Adani Mining Chief Executive Jeyakumar Janakaraj said in a statement. Adani Mining is a unit of Adani Enterprises.
The project still needs a mining license, landowner agreements along the rail route, and approval for a revised port expansion plan that calls for dredge waste to be dumped on land instead of near the Great Barrier Reef.

Black money case: SC orders govt to give all namesSpiceJet barred from advance bookings beyond one month
The top court was unconvinced by the Attorney General’s argument that such an order would hinder negotiation of tax treaties with other countries. Photo: Mint
New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday told the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government it must hand over to the court all the information it has on accounts held by Indians in foreign banks, setting a day’s deadline that finance minister Arun Jaitley said his government would have “no difficulty whatsover” in meeting.
Jaitley said that the government would submit the full list of account holders in an ongoing black money case before the Supreme Court on Wednesday.
“The government has absolutely no difficulty in giving the court the full list. The government is keen to follow whatever procedure to get at the root of the matter so that action can be taken,” he added.
Jaitley also said that the government has no problem with any agency investigating the case—a public interest litigation filed by senior lawyer Ram Jethmalani seeking a return of black money allegedly salted away by Indians in foreign banks in order to evade Indian taxes.
“The truth about these names and also these accounts must come out so that penal action can be taken against the people and the money lying there can be brought back to India,“ Jaitley told reporters after the Supreme Court order.
“The government has no difficulty whatsoever with any agency investigating this matter because there is nobody the government wants to protect in this case so that those whose names have come must really be investigated and punished according to law,” he added.
Jaitley said the government is also keen that the procedure followed must be such that the reciprocating countries continue to cooperate with India.
Earlier, passing the order, a bench of chief justice H.L. Dattu and justices Ranjana Prakash Desai and Madan B. Lokur rejected protests by the government, represented by attorney general Mukul Rohatgi , that such disclosure would violate the certificate of confidentiality the Indian government gave when foreign authorities disclosed this information to it. The apex court said it would deal with that problem when it arises.
The court was also unconvinced by Rohatgi’s argument that disclosure of information would hinder negotiation of tax treaties and procurement of information about black money from other countries in the future.
Rohatgi informed the court that the procedure being followed by the government at present was to issue a notice to everyone whose names figured on the lists that had been provided by foreign governments. Following this, the income tax (I-T) authorities would decide whether to launch prosecution—based on whether the response it received gave a satisfactory explanation of why a foreign bank account was held.
Before this stage, the government could not reveal names since this would prejudicially affect genuine account holders.
But the court said the government need not investigate the matter on its own—all it needed to do was “to request foreign countries to give names” and “pass on” the information to the Supreme Court, which would then monitor the probe.
Dattu said the apex court would direct the I-T department or the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to conclude the investigations in a month’s time.
Chiding the government for “trying to take a protective umbrella for these people (the account holders)”, the chief justice said that “unless we monitor this case, nothing will come out of it”.
Even though the court suggested during the course of the proceedings that the information could be submitted in a sealed cover, no specific directions were given on the mode of disclosure.
Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal has also filed an intervention application in this case saying that he “is in personal knowledge of some of the names, having black money stashed in their foreign bank accounts”.
By refusing to clarify an earlier order that had directed the government to disclose names of people against whom investigations had been concluded, the Supreme Court has effectively forced the government to reveal the names even if the investigation had found their accounts to be genuine.
Analysts said the political implications of the court order could be far-reaching.
While the BJP has said that revealing the names of account holders could “embarrass” the opposition Congress party, the latter has accused the ruling party of acting out of a motive of political vendetta.
On Tuesday, the Congress party welcomed the Supreme Court’s decision and accused the BJP of “political blackmail” over the issue.
“We welcome the Supreme Court’s decision in which it has said sternly that all the names must be provided in the court by the government,” said Ajay Maken , Congress spokesperson and general secretary. “We have always said that black money should come back to India as promised by the BJP in its election campaign.”
If the BJP’s claim is true, then this could spell trouble for the Congress, whose senior leader and former minister of state for external affairs, Preneet Kaur , is said to be on the list.
Kaur said on TV channels on Monday that she had received a notice from the tax department concerning a foreign account allegedly in her name; she said she held no such account.
According to Shiv Visvanathan , a New Delhi-based sociologist and professor at the Jindal School of Government and Public Policy in Haryana, the Supreme Court was essentially trying to pull the plug on the political blame game generated by the issue.
“The Supreme Court is pre-empting the political games over the issue of black money and is basically saying that this is a legal matter. Politically, this is turning into a long-range political blame game and the apex court is saying there should be no more of it,” Vishwanathan said. “This is not a round of musical chairs; if someone is guilty, it should be so irrespective of whichever political party they belong to,” he added.
“In the long run this could trigger conflict between the executive and the judiciary but that is not really the main question. The point is that scandals and scams happen in this country and there is never an ending. Lots of names are tossed, the society consumes it and nothing happens eventually,” Vishwanathan said.
“The court seems to be expressing a trust deficit with the government. The new government got a massive mandate for change but their approach towards this issue was one of continuing in the footsteps of the previous government. It (the court) wants the government to show both intent and action,” said Rahul Singh, who teaches at the National Law School, Bangalore and researches at Balliol College, University of Oxford.
Rahul Garg, leader of direct tax practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers, a consulting firm, said the decision by the government will definitely generate debate on the aspect of confidentiality in international treaties, as one may claim that even if given in a sealed envelope, a disclosure has been made as the information has been handed over to another party other.
“However, ultimately the sovereign right of the government should prevail. The Indian government should be able to explain to its partner countries through diplomatic channels that the names were handed over to the judiciary under special circumstances and that it was not a matter of routine,” he added.
Corruption was a key election issue in the April-May Lok Sabha polls and charges against senior leaders of the Congress, which led the previous United Progressive Alliance government, contributed to the heaviest electoral defeat suffered by the party.
On Monday, the government disclosed the names of three people or entities it said had salted away black money in illegal foreign bank accounts, but none of them were politicians from the Congress.

Facebook Warns of Increased SpendingYou are here: Home Corporates
Facebook Warns of Increased Spending, Shares Fall 9%
Reuters | Updated On: October 29, 2014 07:54 (IST)
Aviation Regulator Acts Tough Against Troubled SpiceJet: Report
San Francisco: Facebook Inc warned on Tuesday of a dramatic increase in spending in 2015 and projected a slowdown in revenue growth this quarter, slicing a tenth off its market value.
The hefty spending plans exposed the first signs of stress in the rock-solid support that investors have accorded the social networking company over the past year.
With Facebook's mobile advertising business delivering repeated quarters of breakneck revenue growth, the company has faced little pushback from investors on pricey, multi-billion dollar acquisitions such as WhatsApp and Oculus. Shares of Facebook reached an all-time high of $81.16 on Tuesday, before the company reported its third-quarter results.
Chief Financial Officer Dave Wehner told analysts on a conference call that the social network is preparing for a 55 per cent to 75 per cent spike in expenses next year, when the world's largest social network intends to invest in Whatsapp, Oculus and other products that have yet to show a profit.
That's a big change from the company's current spending patterns, with costs and expenses in the first nine months of 2013 up a relatively modest 32 per cent. Facebook declined to provide any estimates for its expected pace of revenue growth in 2015, adding to investor worries.
"Giving expense guidance without giving revenue guidance is frustrating and spooking The Street," said BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield.
"The multi-billion dollar question is what's revenue growth going to look like next year," he said.
Wehner forecast revenue growth of 40 per cent to 47 per cent in the final quarter of 2014. That's down sharply from 59 per cent in the third quarter.
The financial forecasts came on the same day as Facebook revealed hundreds of millions of dollars in losses from WhatsApp.
Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has told Wall Street he is in no hurry to extract a payoff from the collection of acquired products, stressing the importance of growing the number of users first.
"For us products don't get that interesting until they have about a billion people using them," Zuckerberg said.
Shares of Facebook, up roughly 47 per cent this year, slid nearly 9 per cent to $73.80 in extended trading on Tuesday.
Mobile surge
Facebook reported a better-than-expected 59 per cent jump in third-quarter revenue and a solid gain in its user base that's already the world's largest social media community. The company is considered a pioneer in mobile advertising, outshining rivals like Twitter Inc, which are struggling to sustain user engagement and growth.
Google Inc, the world's No.1 Internet search engine, has seen its advertising rates stuck in a multi-year decline as it adapts its lucrative advertising business for the smartphones that consumers increasingly favor.
Mobile ads represented two-thirds of Facebook's advertising revenue in the third quarter, and the company said that the average price of its ads more than tripled year-on-year.
"They continue to show that there is a lot of demand for their product, both in terms of users wanting to spend time there and advertisers wanting to spend money," said Ben Schachter an analyst with Macquarie Research.
Facebook's total number of monthly users reached 1.35 billion in the third quarter, with 64 percent of its users accessing the service every day.
Facebook said revenue in the three months ended September 30 totaled $3.2 billion, up 59 per cent from $2.02 billion in the year-ago period. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S were looking for revenue of $3.12 billion on average.
Net income increased to $806 million, or 30 cents a share in the third quarter, compared to $425 million, or 17 cents a share in the year-ago period. Excluding certain items, Facebook said it earned 43 cents a share.

India Most Bullish Consumer Market: NielsenECB Weighs Further Action as Economic Picture Darkens
London: Consumer confidence in the United States jumped in the third quarter and improved globally, although people were more optimistic about job prospects than their personal finances, a survey showed on Wednesday.
India remained the most bullish consumer market, while Italy became the most pessimistic, according to the survey by global information and insights company Nielsen.
The survey showed that concerns about the economy and job prospects had eased globally from the second quarter, but in North America and Europe that had been replaced by rising worries about war and terrorism.
European countries generally were the most pessimistic, reflecting the conflict in Ukraine, faltering growth and the risk of deflation in the euro zone. Britain and Germany, however, saw consumer confidence improve.
The Nielsen Global Consumer Confidence Index rose 1 point in the third quarter to 98, according to the survey, conducted between August 13 and September 5.
The index has been steadily rising since the first quarter of 2012 and the latest reading headed closer to the 100 mark that signals optimism among consumers.
US consumers were the seventh most upbeat globally, with their score rising 4 points to 108 as optimism about job prospects continued to surge.
Americans were also slightly more upbeat about the outlook for their personal finances than they were in the second quarter, unlike Europeans, who were more pessimistic, reflecting persistently low wage growth.
"US consumers are now feeling far more confident than in previous years of the recovery due to consistently good job market trends, reflected in steady payroll growth and falling unemployment over the course of 2014," said Louise Keely, a senior vice president at Nielsen.
"They are also benefiting from lower gasoline prices and a gradually improving housing market. In the coming months, as we start to see more people re-entering the workforce and meaningful wage growth, this is likely to translate into broad-based gains in consumer spending."
Australia saw the biggest increase in confidence from the previous quarter, by 12 points, followed by Slovenia with a 9-point increase and Thailand with 8 points.
Chile posted the sharpest drop in confidence, by 7 points, followed by the Philippines with a 5-point decline and 4-point decreases for Italy and Ukraine.
The Nielsen survey was conducted online and covered more than 30,000 consumers across 60 markets.\

  India Fares Better in Protecting Minority InvestorsIron Ore Imports Surge as Prices Fall
Washington: While India's rank for 'ease of doing business' has worsened to 142nd position globally, it fares much better in terms of protection of minority investors and credit availability at 7th and 36th places, respectively.
These are the only two categories (out of total ten considered by World Bank Group) where India is ranked among top-50 countries -- a target set by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the overall ranking.
Meanwhile, the country's spot last year has been revised to 140 after making adjustments and data corrections, whereas it was at 134th position when the rankings were published last year.
Mr Modi, in September, had said that India's ranking could be improved to the 50th position by making government regulations easier.
India is ranked 36th with respect to 'getting credit' category while the country is placed at 7th spot when it comes to 'protecting minority investors'.
In last year's ranking, India was at 28th place in 'getting credit' category and 34th with regard to 'protecting investors'.
"India strengthened minority investor protections by requiring greater disclosure of conflicts of interest by board members, increasing the remedies available in case of prejudicial related party transactions and introducing additional safeguards for shareholders of privately held companies," the report said.
On ease of getting credit in India, the World Bank report said, "... in India a little over a decade ago, an entrepreneur seeking a loan to grow his business would have had little luck because financial institutions lacked access to information systems to assess creditworthiness.
"Today, thanks to the creation and expansion of a national credit bureau offering credit scores and coverage on par with those in some high-income economies, a small business in India with a good financial history is more likely to get credit and hire more workers," it said.
The report covers 189 countries.
The overall ranking is based on ten factors including 'starting a business' (158th rank), 'dealing with construction permits' (184), 'getting electricity' (137)'registering property' (121), 'enforcing contracts' (186), 'trading across borders' (126), 'paying taxes' (156) and 'resolving insolvency' (137).
In South Asia region, the report said India implemented the "largest number of regulatory reforms in that period (June 2013 to June 2014), with 20, followed by Sri Lanka with 16".
This year, for the first time, the World Bank Group collected data for a second city in economies with a population of more than 100 million. In India, the report has considered both Delhi and Mumbai. .
In a release, the World Bank Group said that India set the pace for regulatory reform in the region in 2013/14.
"It made starting a business easier by reducing registration fees and strengthened minority investor protections. And the electricity utility in Mumbai made getting a new connection less costly by reducing the security deposit," the release noted.
Even though India made starting a business easier by considerably reducing the registration fees, the report said the country made it "more difficult by introducing a requirement to file a declaration before the commencement of business operations".

Fed Set to End One Crisis Chapter Even as Global Risks Rise
Reuters | Updated On: October 29, 2014 14:24 (IST)
ECB Weighs Further Action as Economic Picture Darkens
Washington: The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday is expected to shutter its bond-buying program, closing one controversial chapter in its crisis response even as it struggles to manage a full return to normal monetary policy.
The Fed is likely to announce at the end of a two-day meeting that it will no longer add to its holdings of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, halting the final $15 billion in monthly purchases under a program that at its peak pumped $85 billion a month into the financial system.
An important symbolic step, the end of the purchases still leaves the Fed far from a normal posture. Its balance sheet has swollen to more than $4 trillion, interest rates remain at zero, and, if anything, recent events have increased the risk the US central bank may need to keep propping up the economy for longer than had been expected just a few weeks ago.
The statement the Fed will issue at 2 p.m. (1800 GMT) will be read carefully for signs of how weak inflation, ebbing global growth and recent financial market volatility have influenced US policymakers. There is no news conference scheduled after the meeting and no fresh economic forecasts from Fed officials.
"They are worried about the economy, the global one," and are likely to leave much of their language intact rather than signal progress towards a rate hike, Morgan Stanley analyst Vincent Reinhart wrote in a preview of the meeting.
Attention will focus on whether the Fed's statement continues to refer to "significant" slack in the US labor market, and whether it retains language indicating rates will remain low for a "considerable time," as most economists expect.
Paul Edelstein, director of financial economics at IHS Global Insight, said the Fed may also need to acknowledge the inflation outlook is weakening.
"They have been kind of wrong about inflation lately," Edelstein said. "It would behoove them to do something - signal to markets they are not going to tolerate inflation and inflation expectations persistently below 2 per cent."
Fed officials have largely stuck to forecasts that the US economy will grow around 3 per cent this year, with inflation poised to move gradually back to their 2 per cent goal.
However, slower-than-expected global growth and falling oil prices have called that inflation outlook into question.
Investors have recently pushed their expectations for an initial rate hike back to late next year as a result, although a number of top Fed officials recently said they think the US central bank is still on track to bump up borrowing costs in mid-2015.
The Fed's third round of bond buying closes to mixed reviews. Officials argue it helped hold down long-term interest rates, keeping borrowing costs cheaper for companies and households. Others maintain it did little more than prop up stock prices.
The end of the program won't immediately lead to a decline in the Fed's bloated balance sheet.
For now, it plans to continue reinvesting the proceeds of securities that mature, part of an effort to keep many aspects of its monetary accommodation in place. As it stands, officials do not plan to allow the Fed's balance sheet to decline until after interest rates begin to rise.

Delhi govt formation: L-G to hold talks with partiesComments
Delhi Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung said on Wednesday he would explore with all political parties the possibility of forming a government in Delhi.
"In view of the President’s approval to explore the possibility of installing a popular government in the National Capital Territory of Delhi, the Lt. Governor Shri Najeeb Jung would be exploring the possibilities with the leaders of all political parties over the next few days," said a release from his office.
The L-G's move came a day ahead of the Supreme Court's decision on the Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) petition to dissolve the assembly and go for press polls.
Sources said this move would give the L-G some leeway in the apex court as discussion with political parties would drag on for days.
With the Congress and the AAP strongly demanding fresh elections and the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP) still short of a majority, this could also open up the floor for horse-trading, sources added.
On Tuesday, the court pulled up the Centre and L-G over the delay in arriving at a decision on government formation in the national capital.
"Just before every date of the hearing, some statement is made about the attempt being made for the formation of government. But why things are not being done well before the date of the hearing?" the apex court's constitution bench headed by Chief Justice HL Dattu had asked.
The court said President's rule could not go on forever in a democracy and questioned whether the single largest party, the BJP,  was in a position to for a government.
Delhi has been under President's rule over the last eight months, after the AAP government led by Arvind Kejriwal resigned.
In the 70-member Delhi House, the BJP and its ally Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has 29 MLAs - down from 32 after its legislators Harsh Vardhan, Ramesh Bidhuri and Pravesh Verma were elected to the Lok Sabha.
The AAP has 28 members, of which Vinod Kumar Binny was subsequently expelled by the party, while the Congress has eight.
Kejriwal, meanwhile, took a dig at Jung, saying, "For the last eight months, we requested L-G for an all party meeting. The decision can be taken in five minutes."
"… if his intentions are noble he should call an all party meet today (Wednesday) evening."
LG says he will call all party meeting in "next few days"? Why next few days? To seek adj in SC tomo? (1/2)
— Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) October 29, 2014
We demand that LG shud call all party meeting today itself, take final decision by eve and inform court tomo accordingly (2/2)
— Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) October 29, 2014
Kejriwal had earlier accused Jung of favouring the BJP on the matter of the formation of the government in Delhi.
Reacting to reports that the L-G has got the President's nod to invite the single-largest party to form the government, Kejriwal accused the BJP on Tuesday of indulging in dirty tricks.
After the court asked the Centre and L-G why they had taken such a long time in taking a call on the Delhi deadlock, Kejriwal had said the BJP would lose if fresh elections were held and was trying to delay the matter.
Meanwhile, earlier in the day, Jung met Union home minister Rajnath Singh over the issue of government formation in Delhi.

PM Modi s Next Reform; FDI Norms Eased in ConstructionIron Ore Imports Surge as Prices Fall
Continuing with its reforms agenda, the Narendra Modi government on Wednesday eased foreign direct investment (FDI) norms in construction, to encourage foreign investment in the real estate sector.
The minimum built-up area requirement for FDI in construction projects has been relaxed to 20,000 sq metres from the existing 50,000 sq metres. The minimum capital requirement for such projects has also been brought down to $5 million from $10 million.
The Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion (DIPP), under the Commerce and Industry Ministry, had earlier proposed the changes.
Although 100 per cent FDI is allowed in townships, housing and construction, it comes with stringent conditions.
Prime Minister Modi has been on a liberalization drive to attract more investors into the country. The FDI cap in defence was hiked to 49 per cent from 26 per cent and 100 per cent FDI was allowed in railway infrastructure.
In July, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in his maiden Budget had said that projects which commit at least 30 per cent of the total project cost for low-cost affordable housing would be exempted from minimum built-up area and capitalisation requirements, with the condition of a three-year lock-in.
Between April 2000 and August 2014, construction development including townships, housing and built-up infrastructure in the country received FDI worth $23.75 billion or 10 per cent of the total FDI attracted by India during the period.

No Need to Panic at Oil Price Drop  Says OPECIndian Realty Market Sees $4.5 Billion Investment During January-September: CBRE
There is no need to panic at the recent drop in oil prices, the secretary general of OPEC said on Wednesday, saying low prices would curb competing supplies and require the group to pump far more by the end of the decade.
Abdullah al-Badri said output of higher-cost oil supplies such as shale would be curbed if oil remained at around $85 a barrel, while the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries enjoys lower costs and will see higher demand for its crude in the longer term.
The comments are a further indication that OPEC, which meets in November to set output policy, has no plan to cut supply in a bid to push prices back up. OPEC members have previously said they wanted oil at around $100 a barrel.
"If prices stay at $85, we will see a lot of investment, a lot of oil, going out of the market," Badri said in London at the Oil & Money conference, an annual industry event. "About 65 percent of the producers, they have high costs. Not OPEC."
Brent crude has dropped more than a quarter from above $115 per barrel in June as abundant supplies of high-quality oil such as U.S. shale have overwhelmed demand in many markets, filling stocks worldwide.
Badri did not say whether OPEC needed to cut oil production at its Nov. 27 meeting in Vienna to support the market, and appealed for calm over the decline in prices.
"We do not see much change in the fundamentals. Demand is still growing, supply is also growing. OPEC is reviewing the situation," he said.
"The most important thing is we should not panic," he said. "Unfortunately, everybody is panicking. We really need to sit, and think and see how this will develop."
PRICE FLOOR
Badri declined to specify a level at which oil prices might find a floor, saying OPEC did not have a price target but would instead leave that to the market.
"OPEC's average price will still be $100 at the end of this year so we are fine for 2014," he said. "The fundamentals do not reflect this low price."
"OPEC does not have a price target. We must let the market settle down."
Brent was trading around $87 by 1220 GMT after reaching a four-year low of $82.60 two weeks ago.
Badri said last month that he expected OPEC to lower its oil output target when it meets in Vienna, which would be its first formal output cut since the 2008 financial crisis.
OPEC has a production target of 30 million barrels per day (bpd) and Badri suggested last month that this should be cut to around 29.5 million bpd.
Since then, key OPEC members Iran and Kuwait have said a cut in output at the meeting was unlikely. Top producer Saudi Arabia has yet to comment publicly.
Badri reiterated that supplies from rival producers, such as shale oil, were not a threat to OPEC long-term and said OPEC had to be ready to pump far more in future.
"In the longer term, OPEC must be ready to produce. Around 2018-2020, U.S. tight oil will slow down," he said. "By 2020, OPEC must be ready to produce 40 million bpd of oil, and 50 million bpd of liquids, that's crude and natural gas liquids."

I-T to prosecute 300 a/c holders abroad | To probe 90 from M baiBlack Money
(Prosecution is being sought…)
NEW DELHI: The Income Tax department is likely to initiate prosecution against close to 300 people whose names have been submitted to the Supreme Court today in connection with the probe into alleged blackmoney accounts in HSBC Bank in Geneva.
Officials said the department has informed the Special Investigation Team (SIT), constituted to go into the issue, to allow it to start the "first step of prosecution" under two sections of the Income Tax Act.
Prosecution is being sought under Section 277 (false statement in verification) and 276 D (failure to produce documents) so that the department can share information with other enforcement agencies like the ED and CBI, they said.
The sources said the department has already realised Rs. 200 crore in taxes and penalties from some of these account holders who have accepted to holding these accounts abroad. There could be another Rs.200 crore to Rs.300 crore in taxes and penalties that could be realised from the others, they said.
"The list of 627 Indians submitted to the apex court today has close to 300 people against whom prosecution action can be launched soon. Basic prosecution, at least under select sections of the I-T Act. While some 120 cases are already under prosecution these fresh individuals and entities can also be booked based on prima facie evidence gathered by tax sleuths," sources said.
They said this will enable the SIT to hand over some vital information to agencies like Enforcement Directorate and CBI who could take action under their mandates and the laws that they enforce.
International and bilateral treaties allow a member nation to share such information obtained by one agency with others only at the stage of prosecution or when the matter is in the purview of courts of the land.
"The SIT has agreed to this and we expect to file new prosecutions sooner than later. In these 300 cases the I-T department has some evidence," they said.
Officials said these cases pertain to the years 1999-2000 and they will get "time barred" by March 2015 and hence there is "no time to loose" for the authorities.
Sources privy to the contents of these lists said there are a number of "established" cases where the foreign account is genuine and has been reflected in tax statements filed by the individual or entity.

French Drug Maker Sanofi Sacks CEOYou are here: Home Corporates
French Drug Maker Sanofi Sacks CEO Viehbacher
Reuters | Updated On: October 29, 2014 22:51 (IST)
Aviation Regulator Acts Tough Against Troubled SpiceJet: Report
Paris: Sanofi's board ousted its chief executive of six years at a special meeting on Wednesday, two days after it emerged he had fallen out with the French drug maker's chairman, wiping more billions off its market value.
The management turmoil comes at a particularly awkward time for France's second-biggest listed company, after it warned on Tuesday that growth in its key diabetes business would likely stall next year.
The board said on Wednesday Sanofi would continue the strategy of international expansion pursued under Chris Viehbacher, blaming his dismissal on his management style and poor relations with the board.
But some analysts fear the company may become more insular.
"Viehbacher tried hard to change the DNA of the company but the board won in the end. Sanofi will become more parochial now," said Navid Malik, head of life sciences research at Cenkos Securities in London.
Shares in Sanofi were down more than 4 per cent in morning trade. That takes their decline over the past three days to more than 15 per cent, wiping almost 17 billion euros ($22 billion) from the company's market value - or more than the entire market capitalisation of French carmaker Renault.
Sanofi said chairman Serge Weinberg would take on the CEO role until a replacement for the ousted German-Canadian Viehbacher was found. Mr Weinberg said on a conference call there had already been contacts with potential candidates in the pharmaceutical industry and nationality would not be a factor.
"We want to choose the best possible boss for Sanofi, so we'll take the time that's needed," Weinberg said, adding the board would strive to go "as fast as possible".
Unanimous decision
Sanofi's first non-French boss, Mr Viehbacher transformed a national champion into a global business, largely due to the $20 billion acquisition of US biotech and rare diseases company Genzyme in 2011, which tipped the enlarged group's centre of gravity away from Paris and towards Boston.
But his straight-talking and sometimes brusque management style raised the hackles of trade unions, and a source close to the board told Reuters this week that it was unhappy at the lack of communication from an "authoritarian, solitary, secret" CEO.
Mr Viehbacher did not inform the board when he recently oversaw a review of what to do with an $8 billion portfolio of off-patent drugs in Europe, most of which are produced in France. The options studied leaked to the press and fired up tensions.
Mr Weinberg said the unanimous decision from the board's 15 members to remove Mr Viehbacher stemmed mainly from his management style and poor cooperation. He also cited problems with Mr Viehbacher's execution of group strategy, pointing to inventory problems in Brazil last year, a slowdown in sales in China and Tuesday's warning on its diabetes business.
The fact Mr Viehbacher moved to Boston in June did not help relations improve, but his change of residence was not the root of the dispute, one source close to the board said.
Uncertainty over Mr Viehbacher's role first surfaced on Monday with the publication of a September 4 letter he sent to the board asking for clarity about his position.
A source close to the matter said Wednesday's board meeting lasted only 30 minutes and was relaxed. "Chris Viehbacher thanked everybody and said he respected the board's decision. He seemed prepared," the source said.
French cosmetics group L'Oreal is Sanofi's largest shareholder, with a stake of 9 per cent. Officials at the company were not immediately available to comment.
M&A?
Some investors were disappointed Sanofi did not set out a plan on Tuesday to offset problems at its diabetes unit with cost cuts. However, Citi analyst Peter Verdult said scope for significant cuts was limited by the need to invest in the new drug pipeline. It is also difficult for Sanofi to cut its domestic cost base in France, due to strict French labour laws.
One lever Sanofi could pull would be to make further acquisitions, according to Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson.
"Generally speaking, in the pharmaceutical sector, larger M&A deals tend to happen when companies are in difficult straits and this is where Sanofi seems to be at the moment," he said.
Sanofi has stayed somewhat on the sidelines of a global tide of mergers and acquisitions in the industry over the past year.
Weinberg ruled out mega-deals, saying these rarely created value, but said the group would keep looking at targeted acquisitions to strengthen its existing businesses.
"It's not because we haven't acted lately on this front that we won't do so tomorrow, but we are not interested in big operations, in what we call mega-mergers," he said.

Oil India Seeks More Hydrocarbon Concessions
Press Trust of India | Updated On: October 29, 2014 13:58 (IST)
Aviation Regulator Acts Tough Against Troubled SpiceJet: Report
Singapore: India's second largest public sector company Oil India Limited (OIL) is seeking more hydrocarbon concessions across the globe, including in Brazil and Mexico.
"We are aggressively looking for a lot of good property from where we can bring crude oil into India," Sunil Kumar Srivastava, chairman and managing director (CMD) of OIL, told PTI on Tuesday.
"The government of India is very supportive of our overseas ventures. They are encouraging us to go global to help reduce energy import volumes," he said.
"The more oil and gas we bring into the country, it would help reduce the country's energy import bill," he said on the sideline of the Singapore International Energy Week.
India imports about 75 per cent of its crude oil and 30 per cent of its natural gas requirements a year.
Among its major ventures abroad, OIL has invested $900 million on four per cent farm-in stake in offshore Mozambique.
OIL and ONGC Videsh Limited (OVL) had announced a 10 per cent farm-in acquisition with Mozambique in January this year.
The company operates in 11 overseas countries and produces small quantities of hydrocarbon in the United States, Venezuela and Russia.

Boy or girl Family with 12 sons awaits baby 13Boy or girl? Family with 12 sons awaits baby number 13

Rockford, Michigan, October 29, 2014

A western Michigan couple with 12 sons is expecting baby No 13, and even though they're sticking to their tradition of not finding out in advance whether they're having a boy or girl, they said they'd be shocked if their streak is broken.
Jay and Kateri Schwandt's baby is due May 9, The Grand Rapids Press reported. Even though they expect it will be another boy, the couple said they would welcome either into the family.
"If we were to have a girl, I think we would go into shock," Kateri Schwandt said. "It would probably be disbelief."
If he had a choice, Jay Schwandt said he would love to have a girl, but they're just "hoping for a healthy baby." Still, he would like to see the effect of adding a girl to the mix in a household with 12 boys.
In this  file photo, the 12 Schwandt brothers pose for a photo in their home in Rockford, Mich. Clockwise from bottom left are, Tyler, 21, holding Tucker, 2 days, Vinny, 10, Drew, 16, Zach, 17, Charlie, 3,  Calvin, 8, Brandon, 14, Luke, 19 months, Gabe, 6, Wesley, 5 and Tommy, 11. (AP Photo)
"I've experienced all the boy stuff," he said. "As long as we are having all these children, it would be really neat to experience the other side."
The couple welcomed their twelfth son, Tucker, to the world on Aug. 4, 2013. Their oldest son is now 22 years old.
"The stuff that goes on in this house is all-boy - roughhousing and wrestling," Jay Schwandt said. "If there was a little girl in there, I assume it would be different."
Kateri Schwandt, after being the sole female in the family for more than two decades, said she would lean toward having one more boy.
"A little girl would be neat to have in the house, but a little boy kind of takes the pressure off," she said. "We know what we are doing. Why change things up?"
The Schwandts, who live Rockford, which is north of Grand Rapids, consider themselves devout Roman Catholics and don't believe in using birth control. Kateri Schwandt comes from a family of 14 kids. She said she is feeling well.
"I love being pregnant," she said. "I've spent half of my life being pregnant. It's very neat and very special."

Al Qaeda leaflets talk of ISIS-style caliphate in BangladeshAl Qaeda leaflets talk of Bengal caliphate
Snigdhendu Bhattacharya , Hindustan Times  Kolkata, October 29, 2014
First Published: 20:25 IST(29/10/2014) | Last Updated: 09:11 IST(30/10/2014)
Comments
Intelligence officials in West Bengal have found a purported al Qaeda pamphlet, which talks about establishing an ISIS-style Islamic caliphate in Bangladesh – one that eventually includes several eastern and northeastern Indian states.
The pamphlet, written in Bangla and being secretly distributed in West Bengal and Assam, says establishing a caliphate in Bangladesh is crucial for intensifying jihad in Indian states on the eastern border. The text, credited to al-Qaeda’s media wing, specifically mentions West Bengal and Assam, though intelligence officials suspect Bihar and Jharkhand also feature in the terror group’s plans.
“If we manage to establish a Syria-like reign here (in Bangladesh) then Muslims from Assam, Arakan (former name of Burma’s Rakhine State) and West Bengal too would be able to come here for hijrat (migration with religious agenda). Simultaneously, anti-India revolts would intensify in seven eastern Indian states,” says the pamphlet. “This would be a huge blow for India, one of the key non-Muslim states in the changed situation of the world.”
The discovery of the jihadi literature comes after al Qaeda announced its plans in September to open a branch in the Indian subcontinent. The pamphlet, urging people to restore the Islamic rule of pre-colonial India, may raise new security challenges amid growing communal polarisation in West Bengal, analysts said.
“We have got a copy of the leaflet. We will soon send it to New Delhi. This issue has to be discussed at the top level,” a senior officer working with a central intelligence agency told HT on Wednesday.
The pamphlet, suspected to have been smuggled into the state through Bangladesh, was discovered a few days before the October 2 Burdwan blast in which two operatives of the militant outfit, Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), were killed while making bombs in a house.
HT has a copy of the seven-page pamphlet but could not verify if it is an al Qaeda document.
“They have active modules in Jharkhand and Bihar. We have specific inputs that many of those operating in West Bengal had also visited Jharkhand,” an intelligence officer told HT.
Analysts say al Qaeda’s efforts are the latest signs of the organisation striving to stay relevant in the face of growing support for ISIS in Iraq and Syria.
West Bengal home secretary Basudeb Banerjee refused to speak to HT, while additional director general of law and order Shibaji Ghosh and additional director general of intelligence Banibrata Basu did not respond to text messages.
The pamphlet comes close on the heels of the launch of al Qaeda’s English mouthpiece, Resurgence, which deals with its plans for India and Bangladesh. While an article on India urged Muslims here to “regain lost glory of ruling India”, another on Bangladesh stressed that the country was becoming an outpost of India “politically, economically and culturally”.

Over 100 feared dead in Sri Lanka tea region mudslideInvestigations into the attacks reveal a well-thought-out plan by the Lashkar-e-Taiba - with active help from Islamabad - to disrupt the assembly elections that have seen record turnouts, sources told HT.

Hint of normalcy returns to Delhi s TrilokpuriHint of normalcy returns to Delhi's Trilokpuri
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 29, 2014

Trilokpuri limped towards normalcy on Wednesday as Delhi Police lifted the prohibitory orders in the area for six hours.
The police force, though, continued with their tight vigil in the area with camera-fitted drones hovering overhead to keep an eye on residents.
On Wednesday, shops in the area opened for business as usual with Delhi Police and the state government continuing with their special provisions for food and basic necessities.
Sources in the police suggested that the prohibitory orders enforced in the area might soon be done away with completely, though the deployment of forces was likely to continue.
“No violence was reported in the area on Wednesday (the fifth consecutive day). We will further relax the prohibitory conditions on Thursday, although the pickets and deployment of the force will remain steady,” said Special CP (law and order) Deepak Mishra.
Sources claimed Delhi Police had decided to go ‘slow’ for now with their investigations owing to Muharram (that will be observed on November 5). The probe is likely to pick up pace after that.
Despite the semblances of peace returning to the area, unsure locals stocked food items and other essentials from makeshift stalls set up by the government.
“This is the first time in days that peace has returned to the area. We do not know what happens tomorrow. The government has set up shops for us so we are sure that the products are adulteration-free,” said Vimla Devi, resident of Block 20.
The drones deployed by Delhi Police have helped officers confiscate 70 bags of bricks seized from eight blocks. The police recovered more than three bags of glass bottles of various sizes and more than 30 knives and five swords.
Delhi Police chief BS Bassi, on being prodded about the possible trigger for the riots, said they would look into all possible angles during their probe.
A three-member team of the minority commission also visited Block 15 at Trilokpuri and the local police station on Wednesday and took a stock of the situation.
“I have requested to police to take strict action against the miscreants. I have also given them some names based on my interaction with local residents,” said Captain Praveen Davar, a member of the committee.
The commission also asked the people affected by the violence not to believe rumours.
“Everyone wants peace in the area,” Davar said.

Tech Mahindra Posts Profit of Rs 720 Crore in Q2
Press Trust of India | Updated On: October 29, 2014 23:06 (IST)
Aviation Regulator Acts Tough Against Troubled SpiceJet: Report
Mumbai: Notwithstanding a healthy rise in revenue, Tech Mahindra on Wednesday reported a marginal growth in September quarter net profit at Rs 719.7 crore as foreign exchange losses impacted the bottom line.
The Mahindra Group company had reported a net post-tax profit of Rs 718.4 crore in the year ago period.
Chief financial officer Milind Kulkarni said there was an amortisation gain in the year-ago quarter through a large deal signed in FY08 that used to result in a gain of $9 million till last year, which is over now, impacting the bottom line growth.
Also, there was a Rs 45.8 crore loss on the forex side, he said, adding that with high volatility in the rupee, the company changed its hedging strategy recently under which it reduced its duration of the protection to two years from the earlier five years.
The revenue rose 15 per cent to Rs 5,488 crore over the same period last fiscal year while on a sequential basis it rose 7.2 per cent. The profit was up 14.1 per cent on a sequential basis.
Its pre-tax margins also improved to 19.9 per cent during the quarter as against the preceding June quarter's 18.1 per cent.
Executive vice chairman Vineet Nayyar said the company believes in long-term contracts and the movement of the performance may vary according to the time period.
He said early on, the company is in the investment phase which impacts the margins but once the work is on stream, the returns are higher.
During the reporting quarter, it experienced an increase in attrition at 18 per cent against 16 per cent in the quarter-ago period.
It added three large clients during the quarter, while the total number of client additions stood at 17, taking the total number of active clients to 649.
Managing director and chief executive C P Gurnani said the telecom sector led among the sectors on the revenue front with 8 per cent growth on a sequential basis, followed by manufacturing at 4.7 per cent and retail at 4.6 per cent.
The Americas market led with a 10.2 per cent growth in revenue while Europe was up 5.6 per cent, he said, adding that there was de-growth in the rest of the world market.
Contrary to the optimism of its larger rival Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Mr Gurnani said the domestic opportunity, even with initiatives like 'Digital India' by the new government, does not excite the company.
On future deals, he said the situation is much better than the year-ago period, with opportunities in the retail, manufacturing, BFSI and life sciences sectors.
However, it may take time for the deals to fructify due to the upcoming holiday season, he said.
Shares in Tech Mahindra, on Wednesday, ended at Rs 2,396.50 apiece on the BSE, up 1.16 per cent from the previous close.

Women Should Speak Up and Ask for Raises  Promotions  and New Roles -- Here s Howreddit
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in a keynote interview on October 9th at the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing came out with a zinger. When questioned whether women should ask for raises, Nadella was quick to respond that they shouldn't. His explanation: "knowing and having faith that the system will actually give you the right raises as you go along." And to round out his answer, he said that it's "good karma" not to ask for a raise.
That may be fine for him, since last year he received an $84 million dollar karma-filled pay package.  It may be fine for many men, since in 2013 men in the US received 22 percent more in salary than women did. But it's not fine for women to wait for the "system" to reward them. Indeed, the longer they wait, the larger their pay gap.
Comments like Nadella's show it's time for women to take action on their own behalf, whether seeking pay increases, promotions, or leadership roles. In Taking the Stage: How Women Can Speak Up, Stand Out, and Succeed , I suggest four ways women can successfully promote themselves in such situations.
First, adopt a bold mindset about what you deserve.
Think of yourself as a key resource (whatever your level), and expect to be compensated as such. When I received a 3-year graduate fellowship, I asked "Is everybody getting the same amount?" The answer I received was that "the men get more, because their fathers don't support them." I replied that I was on my own and needed what the men got. So they gave it to me. If I had taken Nadella's advice the system would not have given me fair pay. Women need to have that sense of what they deserve, and they need to boldly articulate it. Do your research and ask the right questions, and you will know what you should be paid.
What gets in our way? Too often women are grateful for what they have--even if it's too little. We are pleased that we have important responsibilities. We are happy to be of service to our bosses. We are reluctant to ask for more because we don't want to appear dissatisfied. So we silently surrender and accept what has been given to us.
Second, create a strong script for your pitch.
Take time to prepare what you're going to say. Write it down and learn it.
Your script should have a clear structure. Open with a positive grabber that shows your boss you appreciate your role to date. Mention the rewards of the job, the mentoring you have received, the opportunities you have had, and the satisfaction you've derived.
Next, move to your key message, and say that you are interested in moving your career forward, or feel you can support the organization in another role, or that a pay increase is in order given your contribution. State your message strongly, with words like: "I know that I am ready for..." or "My salary needs to reflect my accomplishments."
After stating your message, come forward with several proof points: three or four reasons why you deserve what you are asking for. To make sure your boss hears these points - highlight them with "First," "Second" and "Third." Make sure you don't undercut yourself with mincing language like "I think I deserve..." or "Perhaps you could consider." Keep your tone strong.
Conclude with a call to action, stating what you expect. For example, "I appreciate your consideration, and know that you will be fair to me."  Request a time-frame:  "When can I expect your decision?"
Third, bring vocal strength to your request.
When making your case, be sure you sound convincing.
Women often soften or sweeten their voices or sound excessively cheerful or nice when they are asking for something. Yet, this is exactly the time we need to sound more serious, more grounded, and more leader-like.
To do this, begin by developing gravitas, or vocal depth. This means that you let your voice find its lower registers, and stay grounded as you make your case. Maintaining this tone also means not lifting your voice at the ends of sentences in a pattern called "upspeak." This tendency to "lift off" at the ends of sentences is increasingly common and makes it sound as though the speaker is turning every sentence into a question. Not a good approach when you are seeking to instil confidence!
Finally, watch your vocal tone. It's particularly important not to get emotional. If you get angry or aggressive you'll weaken your case; if you get weepy, you'll only get pity. Instead, keep your tone strong and full of conviction.
Fourth, use the power of presence.
"Presence" is a much-admired quality on the stage, but it is equally important in one-on-one meetings. When you put forward your request, show by your body language that you are completely committed to the outcome you are seeking.
Make strong eye contact. This will show that you really mean what you say! And it will suggest you are confident in the outcome. Sit tall, take up your full chair, and keep your two feet on the ground (to emphasize that you are rooted in what you say). Your gestures should be open (folded arms display defensiveness or aggression). And make sure your face shows animation, but not a "smiley" expression.
These four strategies will serve you well whether you're asking for a salary increase, a promotion, or a new leadership role.  As for Nadella's comment, he claims never to have asked for a salary increase.  Remember this: Men don't have to ask, but women who ask DO get ahead.

TCS only Indian firm in top 50 most innovative companies: BCGAirbus
(Apple topped the chart,…)
NEW DELHI: Country's largest software services exporter Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) was the only Indian company found place in the Boston Consulting Group's global list of top 50 most innovative firms this year.
Technology giant Apple topped the chart, followed by Google , Samsung , Microsoft and IBM as the most innovative companies globally in the list of the global management consulting firm. TCS secured the 43rd position in the list.
Apart from telecom and technology firms, car makers Tesla Motors , Toyota and BMW as well as firms like Nike , Shell, Airbus and McDonald's also featured among the top 50.
BCG has surveyed more than 1,500 senior executives in a wide range of countries and industries since 2004 to help cast light on the state of innovation in global business.
The report examined the factors that separate breakthrough innovators from other companies.
It found that breakthrough innovators are strong innovators first -- they excel at the fundamentals that define successful innovation programmes.
They also cast a wider net for ideas, use business model innovation more and they have cultures geared toward breakthrough success, it added.
Almost half of breakthrough innovators reported generating more than 30 per cent of sales from innovations over the past three years, more than twice the average for all companies, it said.
BCG asked respondents to name up-and-coming companies that are still relatively young or have yet to reach the scale of the top 50 global giants but are making themselves known for innovation. Companies like WhatsApp, Square, Rakuten and Wipro lead this list.
"Innovation isn't getting any easier. Too many companies want to shoot for the moon while their innovation programmes are barely airborne. It is no longer enough to be good at incremental innovation," BCG Senior Partner and Director Neeraj Aggarwal said.
Breakthrough innovators are especially effective at bringing together the pieces required for radical innovation such as management, governance and organisational design that can have a major impact on any company's innovation programme, he added.
The survey found only 13 per cent respondents saying they have a significant ambition to deliver radical innovation.

(As per RBI rules, financially-sound…)
MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank has allowed all urban cooperative banks (UCBs) to act as PAN service agent.
Earlier, only financially sound and well managed UCBs were allowed to act as PAN service agent. They were allowed to do so only after entering a tie-up with UTI Infrastructure and Technology Services Ltd (UTIITSL), NSDL e- Governance Infrastructure Ltd or with an agency authorised by Income Tax Department.
"With a view to expanding the scope of fee-based services offered by UCBs, it has now been decided to permit all UCBs to act as PAN Service Agent (PSA) by entering into a tie-up with any agency authorised by Income Tax Department ," RBI said in a notification.
As per RBI rules, financially-sound UCBs should have a maintenance of a minimum CRAR (Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets Ratio) of 10 per cent on a continuous basis.
Their gross NPAs (non-performing assets) should be less than 7 per cent and net NPAs or bad loans should not exceed 3 per cent.
Also, there should not be any default in maintenance of CRR/SLR (cash reserve ratio/statutory liquidity ratio) during the preceding financial year; should have a continuous net profit for the last three years and sound internal control system with at least two professional directors on the board.

Melting glaciers  changing climateUpdated: October 31, 2014 10:55 IST
Melting glaciers, changing climate
The Hindu SCALING NEW HEIGHTS: Glaciology is not for the faint-hearted. Picture shows Mohd Soheb, a glaciology researcher, checking the precipitation gauge at the JNU base camp .Photo: Meena Menon
TOPICS
environmental issues
Though studies point to an increase in the pace of glacier wastage in the western Himalayas, long-term monitoring is required to study glacier evolution and its relation to the climate
At dawn, Mohd Soheb begins an arduous trek to the high camp at Chhota Shigri glacier in the Pir Panjal range in Spiti valley, Himachal Pradesh. From the PWD guesthouse at Chota Dara, he walks down to the Chandra river where he travels across in a small iron crate using an ingenious system of pulleys to the base camp at about 3,850 metres set up by the Jawaharlal Nehru University’s (JNU) School of Environmental Sciences.
From the camp, the snout of the glacier located at about 4,050 metres, looks deceptively close but actually requires a two hour climb over moraine. Covered by a sheet of dirty ice, it is almost blocked by stones but has a clear stream flowing from it which meets the river downstream at Chota Dara. Soheb will go ahead to 4,800 metres, to the high camp from where he will be carrying out studies. Steam drills are carried all the way up to dig into the snow and ice to place bamboo stakes up to 10 metres deep for measuring melting at intervals after the snout of the glacier. About 100 km from Manali, the glacier is relatively accessible, but for students like Soheb doing his M.Phil in glacier studies, the hardest part is getting there. The five-hour drive from Manali over non-existent roads is bone crushing and then the climbing over moraine filled with giant boulders. What is more challenging is measuring the winter snow accumulation, also called winter balance, just when the snow starts melting in late May, Soheb says. Last year he, along with other researchers, walked 30 km to reach the glacier since the area was snowed under and the roads were not open.
Glaciology, therefore, is not for the faint-hearted. JNU solved the issue of trained human resources by launching a programme from 2013 under a Department of Science and Technology (DST)- Indo-Swiss capacity building programme for budding glaciologists, training nearly 30 persons for advanced research in Himalayan glaciology. Chhota Shigri is one of the earliest glaciers in the country to be studied since 1986 as part of the Himalayan Glaciology Research Programme by DST. This was discontinued in 1989.
Mass balance study
Dr. Pottakkal George Jose, scientist at JNU and now part of the DST’s renewed project on Chhota Shigri glacier, says the idea of starting mass balance studies, which is the most accurate way of measuring glacier melt, was mooted in 2002. He explains that it is a benchmark glacier and is among the very few in the country that are being studied on a long-term basis with data on mass balance. Mass balance is the difference between the amount of ice gained by a glacier in winter and the amount lost in summer. A glacier which is gaining mass has a positive mass balance: more ice is added in the winter than is lost in the summer. A negative mass balance indicates that the glacier is losing mass. Chhota Shigri glacier met most of the benchmark requirements for the study.
“Studies on select glaciers have been carried out by the Geological Survey of India and the snout of the Chhota Shigri glacier has been found retreating”
A Status Report on the Chhota Shigri glacier in 2011 says that, “Apart from helping us to unravel the past climate, understanding the dynamics of Himalayan glaciers has their applicability in the environmental appraisal and mitigation of hazards like avalanches, lake outbursts, etc. in high altitude regions of the Himalayas.” Glacier snout position is the simplest indicator of glacier advance or retreat over a period of time which generally happens due to climatic fluctuations. Studies on Machoi, Sonapani, Bara Shigri and Chhota Shigri have been carried out by the Geological Survey of India (GSI), the Report says and the snout of the Chhota Shigri glacier has been found retreating in recent times.
Dr. A.L. Ramanathan, professor, JNU School of Environmental Sciences, says the mass balance studies on Chhota Shigri glacier have become a Bible of sorts for glacier studies and it uses standard field methodology. Since 2002 the glacier has the longest running series of mass balance measurements in the Himalaya range, he adds. A 2013 paper on the Chhota Shigri glacier by C. Vincent, Professor Ramanathan, Dr. Jose and others (in The Cryosphere 7, 569-582), points to the sparse field data on glaciers, adding that the study of the Chhota Shigri fills a gap in the knowledge of Western Himalayan glacier mass balance. However, the representativeness of the Chhota Shigri glacier cannot be extended to the rest of the Western Himalaya. It also stressed the need to develop ground based mass balance studies on benchmark glaciers in the Himalaya.
An inventory brought out by the Geological Survey of India (GSI) in 2009 shows that there are 9, 575 glaciers in the India administered part of the Himalaya, belonging to various climate regimes and only a sample reflecting certain benchmark properties can be taken up for study. In 2000, DST assigned Survey of India to prepare an inventory of major glaciers in Indian Himalayas which identified 327 major valley glaciers - 60 in Jammu and Kashmir, 85 in Himachal Pradesh, 162 in the Uttar Pradesh hills and 20 from Sikkim.
Poor sampling
A paper by Patrick Wagnon, A.L. Ramanathan and others on the Chhota Shigri glacier published in the Journal of Glaciology, Volume 53, No.183, 2007 says the Himalaya is the largest mountain range of the Hindu Kush Himalaya region but its glaciers are very poorly sampled in the field. One of the most recent and comprehensive global inventories includes only eight glaciers in India and three in Nepal with mass balance measured for at least a year, except Dokriani glacier in the Garhwal Himalaya which has mass balance surveyed over six years (1992-2000). With few long term studies ground measurements are needed for calibration and validation since mass balance cannot be measured from space, the paper says. The four-year study and remote sensing data indicate an increase in the pace of glacier wastage in the western Himalaya, probably related to global warming but long- term monitoring of Chhota Shigri glacier is needed to study the evolution of glaciers and their relation to the climate.
In an overview of the glacier status in Himachal Pradesh, Dr S. S. Randhawa, senior scientific officer of the Himachal Pradesh State Centre on Climate Change, says that glaciers are direct indicators of global warming and satellite data analysis of glaciers in Himachal shows retreat in glacier snouts, variation in snow cover extent and formation of moraine dammed lakes. The Himalayan ecosystem has 51 million people who practice hill agriculture and whose vulnerability is expected to increase on account of climate change. He notes an overall reduction in glacier area from 2077 sq.km. to 1628 sq.km. from 1962-2001 in the Chenab, Parbati and Baspa Basins, and overall de-glaciation of 21 per cent of total area in these basins. Studies by GSI of prominent glaciers in Himachal Pradesh shows a retreat in four glaciers including Chhota Shigri.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) underscores the need for glacier studies and says, “The water contained in glaciers and ice caps (excluding the ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland) is equivalent to about 0.5 m of global sea level. Glaciers and ice caps are rather sensitive to climate change; rapid changes in their mass are possible, and are capable of producing an important contribution to the rate of sea level rise. To evaluate this contribution, we need to know the rate of change of total glacier mass. Unfortunately, sufficient measurements exist to determine the mass balance for only a small minority of the world’s 105 glaciers.”
With the new government’s announcement of a Centre for Himalayan Studies and DST support for research on nine benchmark glaciers in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh, there is some hope that at least the need for such data is being taken seriously.

BP: Tone Deaf to the Endreddit
Last week Geoff Morrell, a senior executive at BP, wrote an opinion piece for Politico , which perpetuated the continuous tone deafness exhibited by the global oil giant since their Macondo well blew out on April 20, 2010, instantly killing 11 men, injuring many other crew members and, lest we forget, flowing an estimated 5 million barrels of oil and untold natural gas over a period of 87 days.  During that 87-day period, BP managed to avoid capturing (and measuring) the total flow from the well, even though they had vessels and equipment on site to do so.  Who knows why; we do know this, though -- environmental fines are based on volume of oil spilled.  BP has argued that, since total flow rate was never measured we have no way of calculating the volume.  To this day the company disputes the US government's estimate of 4.2 million barrels spilled into the Gulf, arguing that it was half that.  Obfuscating the volume is especially critical to BP today since federal judge Carl Barbier ruled in September that the company was guilty of gross negligence , which will cause the environmental fines to multiply to as much as an estimated $18 billion should the government's spill estimate stick.
Morrell also made a surprising "our-crude-ain't-all-that-bad" assertion, claiming that Louisiana light sweet oil "biodegrades and evaporates faster" than other crude oils.  It is indeed true that when crude is subject to air, heat, sea water and sunlight, some of the lighter hydrocarbon elements do indeed evaporate and biodegrade; however, Morrell omitted the fact that what is left behind is a toxic peanut butter-like emulsion that is almost impossible to skim off the water or clean off the beaches.  He also ignores the fact that studies have shown that much of the oil spilled in deep water never comes to the surface .  Opinions vary widely about what happens to that oil over the long term, but some scientists fear ongoing damage to sea life by oil entrained in the deep water column.  Morrell's argument eerily echoes former BP CEO Tony Hayard's statement at the height of the crisis  in 2010 that the spill was "tiny" compared to the Gulf of Mexico which is "a big ocean."  Have they learned nothing?
Finally, Morrell claimed that the decline in the Gulf oyster population was likely due to fresh water from the Mississippi and flooding in 2011, not the millions of barrels of oil in the water and oil emulsion that was spread in the Gulf.  He also claims that there are many other negative impacts on the Gulf coast.  To be fair, that is certainly true, but much of it is man-made , caused by oil and gas drilling activities, dredging and redirecting natural water flows which have caused erosion of the protective Mississippi River delta, making the damage from hurricanes even greater.  However, that doesn't acquit BP of anything.  It just highlights the desperate need for us as a society to move to a more responsible and more sustainable use of our natural resources.   We need to ask ourselves: Why we are out in the deep water drilling in depths of over 5,000 feet on the edge of technology to quench our thirst for oil? Is there a better way?  Certainly there is.
Perhaps, rather than placing blame on others and rationalizing it's own culpability, BP would be better served by taking the lead in innovation to develop a safer, more sustainable and certainly cleaner energy future for all of us. Our need for that is fact; not fiction.

Air charter operators oppose DGCA proposalNew Delhi, October 29, 2014

Air charter operators oppose DGCA proposal
Sandeep Dikshit

Just when prospects were brightening for small air service companies due to changes proposed in a policy for improving air connectivity, they have been jolted by the Government’s suggestions for tightening the norms governing discordant voices have been there ever since the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) suggested plans to amend the rules for Non Scheduled Operators Permit (NSOP) holders, the Business Aircraft Operators Association (BAOA) on Wednesday formally registered its opposition.
"This appears to be a knee jerk reaction which will force a large number of operators to shut shop. Moreover, it will impair utilization of more than 150 aircraft for charter and other services throughout the country," said BAOA President Rohit Kapur.
"One really needs to understand the rationale and what is DGCA trying to achieve through such a notice. While we are willing to work with them to find answers, such an amendment is certainly not a solution to anything," he added.
The issue revolves around the DGCA’s proposed amendment which mandates that NSOP holders must have at least three aircraft. Existing operators have been given a year’s time to fulfil this requirement or shut shop. In the letter to DGCA, the association pointed out that operating one or two aircraft in no way reduces the safety oversight responsibility of DGCA "which appears to be the purpose of this amendment". This will result in the closure of 80 out of 120 NSOP and trigger at least 4,000 job losses.
"Increasing the fleet strength from one to three aircraft requires heavy financial commitments, which are beyond the reach of most NSOPs. There is very little business sense to invest in more aircraft at a time when demand in general and business aviation has been sluggish over the past many years." It also pointed out that the rules in the US, the UK and Canada, considered as a benchmark globally, has no such limitations.

Snapdeal eyes acquisitions  $3 bn in transactions by DecemberComments
A day after SoftBank chairman Masayoshi Son called it the Alibaba of India, Snapdeal on Wednesday revealed plans to acquire technology companies on its way to clocking an annual rate of sales or gross merchandise value (GMV) of $3 billion by December.
Armed with a cash chest of $800 million — $627 million from SoftBank — Snapdeal also plans to hire over 1,000 techies and set up a development centre in Bangalore.
“This is a phase of acceleration and we want to make significant investments in technology in the next few years,” Snapdeal founder and CEO Kunal Bahl told HT.
GMV is the annualised value of merchandise sold on an e-commerce company’s website, which is generally considered a measure of growth. Snapdeal’s bigger rival Flipkart said early this month that it crossed $ 3-billion GMV and expects to touch $5 billion by March 2016.
Flipkart was the first Indian e-commerce company to cross $ 1-billion GMV in March this year, followed by Snapdeal. Online retailers are constantly revising their GMV projections upwards, a sign of the industry’s rapid growth.
However, companies are yet to make profits since they give huge discounts to bump up sales. “If we want to break-even we can do it in two quarters. But that is not the focus right now,” Bahl said. “We have so far spent $ 100 million and have 8-fold of that amount in bank,” he said.
He said the company would hire 1,000 engineers, taking its technology force to 1,500 by next year. “We are setting up our new development centre in Bangalore in the next two-three weeks. We will hire 500 engineers in Bangalore alone. Senior engineers from companies such as Yahoo are joining us,” Bahl said.
About the company’s plans to list on bourses, Bahl said: “Our board will continue to explore the right time to go public. I don’t think any of our investors would want us to go public in a hurry.”
“Be it SoftBank, Azim Premji or Ratan Tata, they all have long-term vision. SoftBank waited 16 years for Alibaba to go public,” he added.
Snapdeal currently has 30 million users and 50,000 sellers on its platform and aims to have a million small businesses selling on its site in the next three years, emulating the Alibaba model of providing a platform for scores of small traders and manufacturers. When asked about the feasibility of having a 20-fold growth on seller base in 36 months, Bahl said, “Two-and-a-half years back we had no sellers.”
About the fierce three-way competition among Flipkart, Amazon and Snapdeal, he said, “We are the fastest growing e-commerce company in the country. The SoftBank investment is a validation of that.”

Private sector executives, technocrats and top economists may soon find their way to coveted slots in public sector units and government departments.
Official sources said a new policy is being framed by the Department of Personnel & Training (DoPT) following instructions from the PMO to rope in professionals and private sector heavyweights with sound managerial experience in government-run institutions and offices including crucial economic and technology-focused ministries.
“While bringing in experience, the move is also aimed at reducing corruption,” the official said.
In a recent interview to HT, Piyush Goyal, minister of power, coal and renewable energy,  had voiced similar intentions of widening the selection criteria to get professionals and management gurus from the private sector.
Sectoral expertise may not be considered as the only criteria for such appointments. “There is no need to have a mining expert as the chairman of Coal India... rather a person with managerial skills and a decent knowledge of mining could prove to be a best fit for the post,” another senior government official said.
It is not an unusual practice to hire corporate heavyweights and even the guidelines of Public Enterprises Selection Board, government’s head-hunter, do not prohibit private individuals from applying for posts in central PSUs.
Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani (as head of the the Unique Identification Authority of India), former Boston Consulting Group chairman Arun Maira (as a member in the Plan panel) and former BSES MD RV Shahi (as union power secretary) are cases in point. All three, however, had relinquished their corporate roles before coming joining government organisations.
IMF economist Raghuram Rajan joined as governor of Reserve Bank of India, a post long dominated by former IAS officers.
NTPC CMD Arup Roy Choudhury welcomed such a move. “Countries like the US follow a similar practice... specialists and experts should be inducted and this will add a lot of value and credibility to the functioning of the government in a fair and transparent manner,” he said.

Black money case: Centre submits list of 627 account holders to Supreme CourtCentre gives black money full list to SC, names to remain secret
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 29, 2014

The government on Wednesday submitted a list of 627 Indians holding accounts in HSBC Bank, Geneva, to the Supreme Court, which directed its special investigating team (SIT) to examine them and take appropriate action.

Handing over a sealed envelope, attorney general Mukul Rohatgi said it contained three documents — the government’s correspondence with the French government, the list of names and a status report.
A special bench headed by Chief Justice of India HL Dattu refused to open the envelope, saying it would be done by the SIT chairman and vice-chairman. “We don’t want to open these papers and embarrass anyone. That has never been our intention,” it said.
Scheduling the next hearing for December 3, it asked the SIT to submit a status report by November 30 after ascertaining who had black money accounts abroad.
The Centre had on Monday disclosed eight names in an affidavit — including those of Dabur India promoter Pradip Burman, a bullion trader and the directors of a Goa mining company, all facing prosecution. Earlier, it had revealed 18 other names.
On Tuesday, the top court directed the government to submit the full list after the latter said it wasn’t possible to make the names of all foreign bank account holders public as all of them may not be guilty of tax evasion. Rejecting the Centre’s submission that such action would breach the privacy of legal account holders, the CJI said, “If it breaches confidentiality, let it be so.”
But on Wednesday, when Rohatgi asked him to open the sealed envelope, he refused to do so.
It was also not clear why the court insisted on getting the list from the government when the latter had submitted it to the court-appointed SIT in June.
Rohatgi told the court the details of account holders were for the year 2006. The data, stolen from HSBC in Geneva, were supplied to France, which passed it on to India in 2011. He said half the account holders were Indian residents who could be prosecuted under income tax laws and the rest were NRIs. Several have admitted to holding foreign accounts but maintain they have paid taxes, he added.
Rohatgi also told the court that most transactions had taken place during 1999 and 2000 and under law, the last date for completion and assessment of all cases was March 31, 2015. Under the IT Act, prosecution for tax evasion can be initiated up to 16 years after the offence.
According to SIT chairman MB Shah, the report submitted by the government has no new details, and the list was the same as the one given to it earlier this year. “We have to question the people named in it,” he told a TV channel.
“The probe is difficult. There is no eyewash. The report will take time. We have already filed the first report in August. I’m hopeful that we should be able to file the final report by next year,” he added.
The Centre, meanwhile, was allowed by the court to raise its objections against making all the names public before the SIT.
“The SIT is headed by two retired SC judges. They are not laymen. Tell them the problems you may face if the names are revealed and let the SIT take a decision on future course of action,” it said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi set up the SIT team comprising regulators and ex-judges to identify illicit fund-holders and repatriate money on the first day in office, as part of a wider clampdown on corruption that he promised during his election campaign.
The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had also accused the previous Congress government of failing to crack down on Indians parking billions of untaxed dollars abroad.
The issue of disclosing the names of foreign bank account holders hogged the political limelight recently, with Jaitley saying the opposition party would be embarrassed if such a revelation was made.
The Congress, on its part, asked the government to come out with complete information without indulging in "selective leaks" and pointed out that "the Congress is not going to be blackmailed under any such threat".
The NDA government said on Monday that Swiss authorities had agreed to provide information to help India investigate leaked accounts, after earlier saying such assistance would break Swiss law.
The court is hearing a public interest petition filed by former law minister Ram Jethmalani in 2009 seeking a direction to the Centre to bring back black money stashed by Indians abroad. Jethmalani had accused the government of attempting to shield powerful politicians and businessmen.
Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal has also filed an application requesting the court to hear him in the matter.
While there are no official estimates, Global Financial Integrity (GFI), a Washington-based think-tank, has estimated that Indians had salted away $462 billion (about 28 lakh crore in current exchange rates) in overseas tax havens between 1948 and 2008.
Black money arises mainly from incomes not disclosed to the government usually to avoid taxation, and, sometimes, because of its criminal links. About a third of India's black money transactions are believed to be in real estate, followed by manufacturing and shopping for gold and consumer goods.
The Congress, meanwhile, said the central government cannot take credit for revealing names of people holding black money abroad when it did so on a Supreme Court directive.
"It is wrong for anyone to take credit for anything that is (being done) by the order of the Supreme Court," party spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said.
The BJP's estranged ally Shiv Sena, too, credited the Supreme Court with bringing out the names in the first list in public domain.
 
"Blackmoney was made a major issue during the Lok Sabha elections (of 2014). The government will not understand how difficult it is to bring back the blackmoney stashed abroad. The Centre has only revealed three names, but the credit for that will go only to the Supreme Court," the Sena said in an editorial in its mouthpiece 'Saamana', describing the names revealed so far as only a 'tip of the iceberg'.
Continuing with his attack on the government, Kejriwal accused the Centre of sparing the big fish holding black money abroad.
"There should not be selective revelation of names. The big fish are being let off," he told the media.

As BJP prepared for the inauguration of its first government in Maharashtra under Devendra Fadnavis on Friday, its estranged partner Shiv Sena said it would announce its decision on whether it will be part of the BJP-led ministry on Thursday.
“We met Uddhav Thackeray and discussed the future course of action with him. The wait is over now, just one more day. We will announce our decision tomorrow,” Sena MP Sanjay Raut told reporters after Sena chief Thackeray held several rounds of talks with top party leaders during the day.
Also present in the huddle were senior Sena leaders Liladhar Dahake, Manohar Joshi, Diwakar Raote, Ramdas Kadam, Gajanan Kirtikar and Subhash Desai.
Sena sources said Uddhav himself will announce the party’s ‘final stand’.
“Discussions are on within the party. Uddhavji will take a final call (on whether to join the BJP-led ministry),” Sena spokesperson Neelam Gorhe told reporters earlier in the day outside Uddhav’s residence ‘Matoshree’.
Both BJP and Shiv Sena leaders had made conciliatory noises after Fadnavis, backed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah, was elected leader of the Legislature Party.
Talks between the two saffron parties for a tie-up were not formally on and sources in BJP had said negotiations will resume only after the new government was sworn in.
A top central BJP leader, when asked if there was any breakthrough in discussions with Sena on the latter’s joining the government, said talks would resume only after the oath- taking ceremony on October 31.
Both parties had yesterday shown signs of a rapprochement with Shiv Sena MP and spokesman Sanjay Raut saying, “The blood group of BJP and Shiv Sena is the same.” He had rubbished media reports that Sena was demanding deputy chief minister’s post and some key portfolios as pre-condition for a reunion between the former saffron allies.

PDAs and smartphones
South Korea’s LG Electronics Inc. said on Wednesday its third-quarter profit jumped 87 percent over a year earlier as smartphone sales set a record high.
LG Electronics said its July-September net income reached 202.6 billion won ($193 million) on sales of 14.9 trillion won. Operating income more than doubled from a year earlier to 461.3 billion won.
LG said the improved earnings stemmed from the recovery of its handset business. It’s 167 billion won profit exceeded that from televisions, LG’s other mainstay business.
The company’s smartphone shipments increased 40 percent from a year earlier to a record 16.8 million units, as its flagship G3 smartphone and mid-tier L series smartphone drove sales. The company said it will continue its “two track” strategy, trying to lure consumers in advanced countries with the high-end G series and expand L series models for consumers in emerging markets.
LG’s mobile communications business remained profitable for a second straight quarter after three quarters of losses.
The improvement in LG’s smartphone business comes as its hometown rival Samsung Electronics Co. is suffering a rapid decline in profit from its mobile division. Samsung Electronics, which is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings on Thursday, will post around 2 trillion won in profit from its mobile communications business, less than one third of its profit a year earlier, according to analysts.
South Korean handset makers are facing a setback in the domestic market after the government this month put a ceiling on handset subsidies. The move is meant to offer buyers more certainty about prices but has dented sales. LG said demand for new smartphones in South Korea will stay subdued.
LG’s Home Entertainment division, which sells televisions, recorded 131 billion won in operating income. The company said shipments of ultra-HD televisions, which pack four-times more pixels than standard HD TVs, increased in countries except in China and South America.
Shares of LG Electronics rose 4 percent in Seoul after earnings release.

French drugmaker Sanofi sacked its CEO on Wednesday following a board room rift over the handling of one of France’s largest publicly traded companies.
Christopher Viehbacher, the first non-Frenchman to lead Sanofi, was dismissed after six years running the company that traces its roots to the early 19th century.
In a statement announcing the ouster, Sanofi’s board referred to the rift with the Canadian-German only obliquely, saying the company needs “a management aligning the teams, harnessing talents and focusing on execution with a close and confident cooperation with the Board.”
Mr. Viehbacher, 54, will be temporarily replaced by Sanofi chairman Serge Weinberg, 63, the one-time head of Gucci parent company PPR who was himself ousted following a rift with his board.
Sanofi’s shares more than doubled during Mr. Viehbacher’s six years at the helm as he cut costs and shifted focus to biotechnology, vaccines and over-the-counter medications. He orchestrated the $20 billion takeover of U.S. biotech firm Genzyme in 2011. But his move earlier this year to Boston from Paris, where he’d moved after taking the helm at Sanofi, raised eyebrows in France.
On Tuesday, shares in Sanofi dived after the company reported a slide in quarterly earnings. Mr. Viehbacher said pricing pressure on its blockbuster diabetes treatment Lantus in the key U.S. market would continue to hamper sales growth into 2015.
Sanofi shares fell 3.7 percent to 71.85 euros early Wednesday following news of Viehbacher’s dismissal.

(Talking about the project,…)
LUCKNOW: In a major step forward towards building India's longest six lane access controlled expressway, the Akhilesh Yadav government on Wednesday signed the agreement with private companies who bid the lowest for constructing it.
The agreement was signed by UP Expressway Industrial Development Authority ( UPEIDA ), Chairman and CEO, Navneet Sehgal on behalf of the state government and representatives of the four companies tasked to build it.
The expressway has been divided into five stretches for handing out the contracts. In the EPC (Engineering-Procurement-Construction) based bidding process L&T had emerged as the lowest bidder for the Lucknow to Unnao stretch, Afcons Infrastructure for Unnao to Kannauj, Nagarjuna Construction Company for Kannauj to Etawah, Afcons Infrastructure for Etawah to Firozabad and PNC Infratech for Firozabad to Agra. The lowest bidders were declared on August 13 and the MoU with these companies were signed on Wednesday in the presence of Chief Secretary Alok Ranjan.
Talking about the project, Navneet Sehgal said that the 302 km long Lucknow to Agra Expressway would be the country longest access controlled six lane expressway. He said that the project would cost nearly 15,000 crore of which Rs 11,526 crore would be for construction of the expressway and the rest for purchasing land at market rates.
The big plus for the project has been the fast paced acquisition of land. Sehgal said that more than 75 per cent of the land needed has already been acquired and the remaining too would be in possession shortly. A total 3,100 hectares of land is needed for construction of the expressway of which 2300 hectares has already been acquired by the government.
The six lane expressway would be 110 meters wide and would cut down travel time from Lucknow to Agra from existing eight hours to less than four hours.
Interestingly the expressway would pass through the Yadav fiefdom of Etawah, Mainpuri and Kannauj and also link the industrial town of Kanpur.
The Lucknow to Agra expressway is one of the pet projects of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav which has now been set rolling. Sehgal said that it will link Lucknow to the west UP region bringing rapid economic growth to the entire region. Officials said that the expressway construction is expected to be completed in three years time.

BB CEO pens open letter ahead of Classic launchBlackBerry CEO John Chen pens open letter ahead of Classic launch

The Classic, which bears striking similarities to BlackBerry's Bold smartphone, will come with a complete top row of navigation keys and a trackpad.

TORONTO: BlackBerry Ltd Chief Executive John Chen penned an open letter to current and former BlackBerry users on Wednesday in a push to create some buzz for the company's new BlackBerry Classic device, which is set to debut later this year.
The Classic, which bears striking similarities to the company's once wildly popular Bold smartphone, will come with a complete top row of navigation keys and a trackpad. Those are features that many BlackBerry fans missed when the company rolled out its revamped BlackBerry 10 line of devices last year.
Chen conceded that the company has made some mistakes in the last few years saying: "It's tempting in a rapidly changing, rapidly growing mobile market to change for the sake of change - to mimic what's trendy and match the industry-standard, kitchen-sink approach of trying to be all things to all people."
"When we lose sight of what you want and you need, we lose you," he said, in a letter published on the BlackBerry blog.
The letter from Chen comes two days after reality television star Kim Kardashian created a stir by professing her "love" for BlackBerry devices, and confessing that she owns a cache of Bold devices, at a conference organized by tech news website Re/code in California.
Chen, who stepped in to take the reins at BlackBerry when the company was faltering badly a year ago, has moved rapidly to get BlackBerry back on track, selling some assets, partnering to make its manufacturing and supply chain more efficient, and raising cash via the sale of the company's extensive real estate holdings in Waterloo, Ontario, where it is headquartered.
In September, the company launched an unconventional square-screened smartphone, the BlackBerry Passport. The Classic is set to have a bigger and sharper screen than its predecessor, the Bold, along with a much larger app catalog and a myriad of other features.
"We are committed to earning your business - or earning it back, if that's the case," he said, promising the company would share more details about the Classic in coming weeks.

MILAN: Fiat Chrysler said on Wednesday it would spin off luxury carmaker Ferrari and list a 10 percent stake on the market as it seeks to raise funding for its ambitious 48-billion euro ($61 billion) growth plan.
The world's seventh-largest carmaker said the board had mandated its management to complete the spin-off next year. It said the remaining 90 percent would be distributed among FCA shareholders - who include the Agnelli family which founded Fiat.
The group, which moved its own primary listing to New York on Oct. 13, expects the Ferrari shares to be listed in the United States and possibly a European exchange.
"As we move forward to secure the 2014-2018 Business Plan and work toward maximizing the value of our businesses to our shareholders, it is proper that we pursue separate paths for FCA and Ferrari," FCA Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said in a statement.
FCA's Milan-listed shares, which fell after the company earlier reported third-quarter results and higher-than-expected debt, rose 5 percent before trading was suspended due to excessive volatility.

Govt relaxes FDI norms for construction  realtyGovernment relaxes FDI norms for construction, real estate sector

(The move will facilitate…)
NEW DELHI: The government eased overseas investment rules in construction to attract money into the funds-starved sector and serve its twin objectives of faster job creation and housing for all. The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved a comprehensive proposal by the Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion (DIPP), dropping the minimum 10-hectare rule for serviced housing plots and slashing the minimum floor area for construction development projects to 20,000 sq m from 50,000 sq m to be eligible for overseas investment.
It also halved the minimum foreign direct investment (FDI) amount to $5 million from $10 million and substantially eased the exit norms, raising an across-the board cheer from an industry that now hopes for bigger foreign fund flows into a sector that desperately needs money.
"The government is bang on (target). We are very glad about the trunk infrastructure completion part as it will bring in asset-based FDI. This will ensure that project developers who have taken FDI are not left with more debt," said Rajeev Talwar, executive director of DLF, India's biggest listed developer. Trunk infrastructure refers to essential amenities such as roads, water supply, street lighting, drainage and sewerage.
The new rules will also give a boost to the 100 smart cities being planned by the government. Home buyers will also cheer the relaxation as fresh inflows raise the possibility of projects that are stuck getting completed and cheaper housing becoming available going ahead. Most housing projects are running one to two years or even more behind schedule because of the slowdown and the shortage of funds on account of elevated debt levels.
"It is an excellent move by the government and will definitely help the developers which are running late with their projects due to the funds crunch. Townships take a minimum of 10 years to be completed, so the relaxation will ensure that funds are not a problem," said RR Singh, director-general of National Real Estate Development Council, or Naredco. The norms will come into force after DIPP issues a notification. The government has promised housing for all by 2022 and toward that end provided an incentive for affordable housing in the revamped policy.
The sectoral condition of minimum area and capital will not apply if the developer sets aside 30% of the project for affordable housing, defined as dwelling units of less than 60 sq m. Singh said finding 10 hectares of land in tier-I and tier-II cities was difficult, so scrapping this rule will encourage investors to bring in money. In its July budget, the new government had said it would relax foreign investment rules for the sector. The government is also looking to boost construction of hotels, tourist resorts, hospitals, special economic zones (SEZs), educational institutions, old-age homes and invest ments by non-resident Indians (NRIs), giving free access in these segments.
"These measures are expected to result in enhanced inflows into the construction development sector consequent to easing of sectoral conditions and clarification of terms used in the policy," the government said in a statement. The sector attracted $1.2 billion in FDI in 2013-14, down 8% from 2012-13. The most significant incentive to foreign investment is the easier exit compared with the existing rule of a three-year lock-in after the completion of minimum capitalisation of $10 million. Under the new rules, investors will have to bring $5 million within six months of commencement of projects and the balance over 10 years or before the completion of project, whichever is earlier.
The investor can exit on completion of the project or three years after the final investment, subject to the development of trunk infrastructure. FDI can be repatriated or transferred before the completion of the project if approved by the Foreign Investment Promotion Board. "Lingering issues with respect to lock-in requirement and exit route along with the prohibitive minimum threshold for built-up area have had a dampening effect on FDI in the sector," said Sachin Sandhir, global managing director, emerging business, and MD, South Asia, RICS.
"A positive announcement towards this end is indeed welcome and will encourage more investors to consider investing in India, if they are able to exit from the projects sooner." The construction sector, which has a significant ripple effect on the economy, grew only 1.6% in FY14, contributing to the sub-5% growth in the year.
 
"Investment in the construction development sector has a multiplier effect on the economy by way of infrastructure creation; substantial employment generation over the entire spectrum from unskilled workers to engineers, architects, designers as well as financial and other supporting services," the government said. Talwar of DLF expects the measures to lead to a revival in the sector and the wider economy.

The cattle fair is the only one of its kind in the world when lakhs of people from rural India flock to Pushkar, along with camel and cattle for several days of livestock trading, horse dealing and pilgrimage.
According to the Hindu calendar, it takes place in the month of Kartika beginning on ‘ashtami,’ the eighth day of the lunar calendar and continues till full moon (‘Poornima’). The camel and cattle trading is at its peak during the first half of festival period. During the latter half, religious activities dominate the scenario. Devotees take dips in the Sarovar lake, as the sacred water is believed to bestow salvation.
Pushkar is transformed into a spectacular fair ground, as rows of makeshift stalls display an entire range of objects of art to daily utility stuff.

McDonald s Is Still Very Cheap  But People Don t Want To Eat Therereddit
Big Macs have gotten more affordable lately. Photographer: Noriyuki Aida/Bloomberg via Getty Images
As sales and profits have crumbled at McDonald's recently, some observers have blamed low-income Americans, saying they must not be able to afford Big Macs any more.
But that's wrong. If anything, Big Macs have gotten more affordable lately. The real problem is that the iconic chain needs to win back its true base: middle-class Americans looking for a cheap, quick meal.
For the past 11 months, sales at U.S. McDonald's restaurants open at least a year -- a key measure of an eatery's health -- have fallen or remained flat. The company announced earlier this week that U.S. same-store sales fell 4.1 percent in September, the worst monthly drop in more than a decade, and that profits plunged 30 percent in its latest quarter. The company's stock price has tumbled about 11 percent over the past six months.
One common explanation for McDonald's woes is that low-income Americans are suffering from a sluggish recovery and unable to afford eating out at McDonald's any more.
But the numbers don't back up that take. For one thing, McDonald's has actually become more of a bargain relative to other food options in recent years: McDonald’s prices haven’t risen as quickly as prices at fast-casual eateries like Panera Bread, according to data from Technomic, a food research firm. Nor have they risen as quickly as broader food inflation, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data:
McDonald's menu prices grew more slowly than prices at fast-casual chains and food inflation overall between 2009 and 2014.
And yet diners are still flocking to other chains despite their typically higher costs. When Chipotle raised menu prices earlier this year, customers didn’t bat an eye -- the chain reported a profit jump of 25 percent the following quarter. That suggests McDonald's problem isn't so much pricing, but a perception that its food isn't worth any price -- unlike, say, Chipotle, which has positioned itself as offering fast, fresh and quality food for which customers are willing to pay more.
Unlike Walmart, whose fortunes have largely mirrored that of the poor , McDonald’s doesn’t take food stamps. That makes it an unlikely regular destination for low-income Americans, according to Joel Berg, the author of “All You Can Eat? How Hungry Is America?”
In fact, a 2011 study from the University of California-Davis found that fast-food consumption actually rises with income, until incomes reach about $60,000.
“That conventional wisdom is wrong,” Berg said of the notion that poor people are more likely to eat at places like McDonald’s.
Given the strength of that conventional wisdom, it's likely going to take a full revamp of McDonald's image to convince the middle-class customers who have fled the chain that it offers more than just cheap burgers for people who can’t afford anything better. What has been the quintessential McDonald’s experience for decades -- inexpensive food that tastes the same everywhere -- just isn’t as appealing any more.
To fix this, the company is working to convince diners it sells “fresh, quality food” at a reasonable price, partly through "transparency initiatives" like a campaign last week asking people to submit questions about its food, according to Heidi Barker, a McDonald's spokeswoman.
"McDonald’s appeals to customers of many diverse backgrounds and lifestyles," Barker wrote in an e-mail statement. "There’s value at every level of the menu, from our Dollar Menu and More to our premium sandwiches and salads, and McCafe beverages."
It could be a hard sell, as McDonald’s CEO Don Thompson acknowledged on a conference call with analysts Tuesday.
“The question is whether or not our value and our food options are resonating as strongly," he said. "I believe that that is the fundamental basis of some of the challenges that we are having.”

Overweight Women More Likely To Have Low-Paying Jobs Than Overweight Menreddit
Fat shaming can have economic consequences.
As a woman gets heavier, her chances of working in a low-paying, physically taxing job grow, according to a new study from Jennifer Shinall, a law professor at Vanderbilt University. But weight doesn’t have nearly as much bearing on the type of job a man lands.
Though obese men are more likely than men of average weight to work in lower-paying, physical jobs, the effect isn't nearly as strong as it is for women. As a result, obese women make $7 less than their average-weight counterparts, while obese men make just $2 less.
“It absolutely suggests that weight is much more of a consideration in the labor market for women than it is for men,” Shinall told The Huffington Post in an interview.
Shinall’s findings add to the growing body of evidence that physical attributes play a depressingly large role in the lives of working women, no matter how they look. Very skinny women tend to get paid more . Hiring committees penalize attractive women by not calling them for interviews.
Such factors typically add to the broader discrimination women already face at work. Research shows women earn less than men in the same roles and are also more likely to work in low-paying fields .
Many female-dominated, low-wage jobs, such as home health care and child care, are where obese and morbidly obese women are most likely to end up, Shinall’s study found.
"Those are the only jobs that are available for the heaviest women in the labor market," she said.
For her study, Shinall analyzed occupation, health and population data for 10,007 women and 8,928 men. She found that, the heavier women get, the more likely they'll end up working in jobs that require more physical activity.
The opposite is true for women seeking jobs in fields that involve a lot of personal interaction, such as sales. Women become less likely to land those roles the more overweight they are. Morbidly obese women who do get jobs in such fields are paid about 5 percent less, on average, than other women, even controlling for factors like education, the study found.
For men, on the other hand, being heavier can actually boost earnings in some jobs. Overweight men working in more physical jobs make about 4 percent more, on average, than their average-weight colleagues, according to the study.
Shinall said she suspects that one of the main reasons obese and morbidly obese women tend to cluster in low-paying, strenuous jobs is because of discrimination in hiring for white-collar roles. Companies may not want an overweight woman representing them to customers, she said, and it's also possible that the person doing the hiring may not want to work with an obese woman.

7  Modern  Inventions That Are Actually WAY Older Than You Think7 'Modern' Inventions That Are Actually RIDICULOUSLY Old

There are some historical facts you just know without having to fire up your smartphone. Ice cream? Clearly came after refrigeration. The digital camera? Easy -- that was around the time "Friends" was on the air. The condom? After latex, duh.
Sorry to break it to you, but you're off by a few hundred (or, in some cases, thousand) years. We partnered with Christopher Nolan's Interstellar , in theaters and IMAX on November 7th, to find those amazing inventions that came so early it almost seems wrong. Let's just say, the pace of human ingenuity will make you say, "whoa."
Ice cream: older than sin.
Although the exact dates are murky, many scholars claim that the first books of the Torah were written around 1280 BCE. The relative ingénues of sacred religious texts, the Bible and the Quran, were written as early as the 1st century CE and 7th century CE , respectively.
But ice cream may have beaten Moses down the mountain -- by a millennium or two. It's contentious (who wouldn't want to claim they created ice cream?), but some food historians date the innovation of ice cream back to China around 3000 - 2000 BCE . Early ice cream variations included snow mixed with syrup, and a delicious-sounding concoction of frozen milk and mushy rice . The consensus is that the dessert also popped up in Persia and pockets of the Middle East before the common era.
So if your love for ice cream feels sinful, just remember: ice cream was around before anyone said anything about sin.
Carbonation was around during Benjamin Franklin's heyday.
Beer drinkers lament: Ben Franklin’s famous quote that beer proves that God loves us is actually about wine . While it’s unknown how the founding father felt about gin and tonics, we suspect he’d enjoy them. In 1767 , the glorious year that carbonation made the G&T possible, Franklin was serving as a Pennsylvania representative to the British Parliament, predicting the American Revolution in letters and partying with French royalty.
That same year, Scottis chemist Joseph Priestley infused carbon dioxide into water by suspending a bowl of it over a beer vat. He later expanded on his experiment in 1772’s “Impregnating Water with Fixed Air,” although he never quite grasped the commercial applications of his discovery of carbonation. (A German named Schweppe did, however). The revolutionary Priestley later fled England for Franklin’s Pennsylvania, and the two were known friends -- so maybe they had a happy hour after all.
When the parachute was invented, America was only three months old.
It would make sense for parachutes to come after the airplane, right? But no. NOTHING makes sense anymore.
In September of 1783, the fledgling U.S. and Great Britain signed the Treaty of Paris, which ended the Revolutionary War. Three months later, and several hundred miles to the south, French physicist Louis-Sebastien Lenormand stepped off the top of the Montepellier observatory clutching onto a 14-foot wood and linen parachute. He floated safely to the ground, putting into practice a design birthed by Leonardo da Vinci in 1485. Throughout the next decade, parachute testers dropped -- usually safely -- from hot-air balloons.
It makes you wonder: would things have been different if the Redcoats had paratroopers?
Vincent van Gogh was still alive (and had both ears) when the first pair of contact lenses was crafted.
In 1888, van Gogh enjoyed one of his most creative periods in Arles -- the French town where he finished painting his famous sunflowers. And, until just before Christmas, when a disturbed van Gogh ( probably ) turned a knife on himself after a fight with artist Paul Gauguin, both ears remained intact.
Earlier that year in neighboring Switzerland, a German ophthalmologist named Adolf Eugen Flick created something that sounds nearly as painful as losing an ear -- the all-glass contact lens. After a few years of experiments on the eyeballs of rabbits and cadavers, Flick became the first to fit a human with contacts. However, because it was made of glass and covered most of a patient’s eye, it could only be worn for a few hours at a time before a lack of oxygen made the wearer's vision foggy and full of blurred halos .
You couldn't pay us enough to try it out, but we imagine it might make the world look a bit like a (painful and irritated) version of " Starry, Starry Night ."
The answering machine was invented when there was still only one President’s head on Mt. Rushmore.
1936 was a busy year. Hitler and Mussolini invaded and annexed the Rhineland and Ethiopia; the first issue of Life Magazine was published; and President Franklin D. Roosevelt attended a dedication ceremony for Thomas Jefferson’s giant head.
That year also saw the sale of what may be the first commercially successful automatic answering machine. The idea, however, had been around much longer: As early as 1924, magazine ads promised a "Telephone and Answering Machine" that was "similar to those used in dictating or talking machines."
In 1934, an engineer at Bell Labs developed a six-foot device that used magnetic tape to record incoming calls. It was innovative, but not well-received. AT&T and Bell feared that being recorded would scare people away from telephones altogether, and squashed the development. A (braver) Swiss company brought a very similar device to market in 1936 .
Of course, it would take another 61 years for George Costanza to perfect the device’s use. Mr. Costanza's addition to Mt. Rushmore is, as of writing, not under consideration.
Condoms were around in the time of the Dodo.
The poor, flightless dodo – aka the banner bird for extinct species – was only discovered in the 1590s , when sailors alighted on the island of Mauritius. The last widely-accepted sighting occurred just 70 years later, in 1662 . Yes, within a century, humans had wiped out the bird -- either through hunting, or by the introduction of pigs and rats into the dodo's environment.
Far from the Indian Ocean, humanity was attempting to wipe out something else: syphilis. The disease, incurable at the time, ravaged Europe. (It was probably brought back by sailors then exploring the world.) In the 16th century, an Italian physician named Gabriele Fallopius penned a treatise that suggested a method of prevention: a sheath of linen that should be treated in a chemical solution, left to dry and then worn during sexual intercourse. Fallopius' breakthrough may have been a reinvention of an ancient Egyptian idea.
Around the same time that the last dodo was leaving the world, the word "condon" popped into existence -- in a report fretting over declining English birthrates.
The English were, at least, doing better than the dodo.
Kodak engineers built the first digital camera the same year as the fall of Saigon.
Children of the 1990s will remember the slow transition from the boxy, yellow disposable cameras to fancy digital ones. But digital was already around for a long time beforehand.
In 1975 , South Vietnamese forces, fighting without the U.S. military, crumbled under a North Vietnamese onslaught. A Dutch cameraman captured the chaos as South Vietnamese citizens scrambled to get aboard American helicopters.
In far calmer settings, Eastman Kodak engineer Steve Sasson crafted the world’s first digital camera out of spare movie camera parts, cassette tapes and a black and white television. It probably wouldn't have served much use in wartime. Weighing in at eight pounds, the .01 megapixel camera took 23 seconds to process a photo.
Also weighing in that year: Muhammad Ali, at 224.5 pounds, for the Thrilla in Manila . We're guessing that the champ was also too quick for the first digital camera.
Any other inventions blowing your mind? Let us know in the comments.
Correction: A previous version of this post misidentified the island of Mauritius as "Mauritania."

Architect Develops The World s First HoverboardArchitect Develops The World's First Hoverboard
Posted:
This post originally appeared on ArchDaily .
by Evan Rawn
Architects can do far more than design buildings. In fact, some of history’s most acclaimed innovators were not only architects, but also inventors. Leonardo da Vinci himself, the epitome of the Renaissance man, sketched buildings alongside ideas for flying machines. Buckminster Fuller was the ultimate futurist and invented the geodesic dome in addition to his Dymaxion Car, an automobile that was far ahead of its time. Now, an architect has developed “the world’s first hoverboard,” and the technology has far-reaching implications for not only transportation, but also buildings themselves. Read on after to break to learn more about what this technology could mean for the future.
Ever since he was in graduate school, architect Greg Henderson has been trying to develop technologies to make buildings more resistant to natural disasters such as earthquakes. In his interview with Aaron Tilley of Forbes, Henderson says, “The idea came from being able to levitate buildings out of earthquakes. All of the patents I was looking at were for moving objects. So I asked, why is that? If I can levitate a train, why not a house?”
For the past two years Henderson has worked with his 19-person startup Arx Pax to develop what they call Magnetic Field Architecture (MFA™), the electromagnetic technology that can make objects hover. However, the idea of using electromagnetic fields to separate objects from the ground is not new. Similar, yet more costly and inefficient versions of the same technology have been used in the development of Maglev bullet trains. Whereas this technology requires the use of expensive electronic sensors, all MFA™ requires is a surface that is a non-ferromagnetic conductor, such as aluminum or copper. This translates to significant savings for transportation technology, and could open up additional opportunities for the technology to be applied on larger scales.
In order to accomplish the seemingly insurmountable task of making a building levitate, Henderson had to start small. The startup recently unveiled a Kickstarter campaign to spark interest in their research and development, and has thought up several ideas to make the technology appealing to consumers. Everyone has seen hoverboards in Hollywood movies, but these high-tech gadgets could finally become a reality. Because the boards require a copper or aluminum surface, Arx Pax hopes to develop a skate park after the launch of the hover boards, which would give consumers a fun place to try out the new gadgets. They hope to have their production hoverboard ready by October 21st, 2015 (the date hoverboard riding Marty McFly travels to in Back to the Future 2).
By approaching the development of this technology through marketing it in a fun and futuristic consumer product, Henderson hopes to garner the necessary funding to make his original dreams of levitating buildings a reality. If this technology takes off, one can imagine a very different world for architects in which gravity does not inhibit structure in the ways it does today. Many of the issues that come with building in earthquake or flood prone areas could be eliminated if buildings could simply levitate above the land. There are likely thousands of other ways in which hover technology could be beneficial and transform the cities in which we live; architects just need to imagine it.

Massive Class-Action Lawsuit Over Defective AirbagsU.S. Consumers Sue Takata Over Airbags; Class-Action Status Sought For Larger Payout
Reuters
reddit
(Adds detail on lawsuit)
Oct 27 (Reuters) - Takata Corp, the Japanese  company whose potentially defective airbags have led to the  recall of millions of vehicles, was sued on Monday by consumers  who claimed Takata and several car manufacturers defrauded them  by concealing crucial information.
The lawsuit, filed with a U.S. District Court in Florida, is  believed to be the first in the United States to seek  class-action status on behalf of consumers nationwide.
If that status is granted, it could subject Takata to a  larger payout in a trial or settlement than if vehicle owners  were forced to sue individually.
The federal lawsuit is at least the third filed against  Takata in the last week over alleged airbag defects. The other  lawsuits were brought on behalf of individual owners.
A Takata representative in the U.S. could not immediately be  reached.
The lawsuit also names car manufacturers as defendants,  including Toyota and Honda. Representatives  for those companies in the U.S. also could not immediately be  reached.
U.S. safety regulators are investigating whether Takata  airbag inflators made from 2000 to 2007 were improperly sealed  or subject to other defects.
At least four deaths and dozens of injuries have been linked  to faulty Takata airbags, and their potential to rupture and  spray metal shrapnel at vehicle occupants.
Takata "had a duty to disclose these safety issues because  they consistently marketed their vehicles as reliable and safe,"  the lawsuit said.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has urged  owners of an estimated 7.8 million Chrysler, Ford  , General Motors, BMW, Honda, Mazda  , Mitsubishi Motors, Nissan, Fuji  Heavy's Subaru and Toyota vehicles to replace their  airbags
The case in U.S. District Court, Southern District of  Florida is Craig Dunn et al vs. Takata Corporation et al,  14-cv-24009.     (Reporting by Dan Levine in San Francisco and Jonathan Stempel  in New York; Editing by Ken Wills and Kenneth Maxwell)

! Introducing HuffPost Moroccoreddit
I'm very excited to announce that the journey we started over a year ago in Tunisia and continued this May in Algeria has now added the final missing part -- HuffPost Morocco -- to create the full ensemble of The Huffington Post Maghreb!
This launch comes at an incredible time, not only for HuffPost -- a journalism outlet and blogging platform with 11 editions around the world, with Greece, India and our Arabic editions coming next -- but specifically for the Maghreb, a region that is undergoing amazing transformations -- socially, politically and economically. In Morocco today we are witnessing a golden age of online collaboration and engagement that is both local and global -- in particular among Moroccan youth. There's no better time to start the conversation.
At HuffPost Morocco we'll be telling the stories that matter most and -- just as important -- helping people throughout Morocco tell their stories themselves, in words, in pictures and in video. We'll be covering topics including corruption, political tensions between Morocco and Algeria, social and religious questions like abortion and public health issues like the threat of Ebola. HuffPost Morocco will also be a place to discuss and celebrate Morocco's unique traditions and culture -- everything from sports and entertainment to technology and parenting.
While HuffPost Morocco will function as an individual edition, it is also a part of our larger regional edition HuffPost Maghreb, led by the incredibly talented Alix Etournaud and Fares Mabrouk, both with deep personal and professional roots in the region. Their mission of telling the Maghreb's most important stories and, at the same time, inviting the people of the Maghreb to tell their own stories has been a huge success in Algeria and Tunisia and will now also come to Morocco.
Leading HuffPost Morocco are editor-in-chief Hassan Hamdani and editorial director Youssef Ziraoui. Youssef, in nearly a decade in journalism, has served as the editor-in-chief and manager of TelQuel's multimedia division. In 2008 he was awarded the Lorenzo Natali Prize of the European Union, which honors journalism that uncovers corruption, abuse and violence in developing countries.
Before this endeavor Hassan had a long tenure at TelQuel magazine, where he was the culture editor, news editor and then editor-in-chief, and he has also worked at Femmes du Maroc and La Vie économique. In 2010, with Aïcha Akalay, Hassan was granted the award for best investigative reporting by Reporters Without Borders, RFI and Organisation internationale de la Francophonie for "The Temptation of Christ," a report about the persecution of Moroccans who convert to Christianity.
The expansion from the east Mediterranean to the Atlantic coast of Africa was carried by the wonderul Samia Cherif, HuffPost Maghreb's head of management, and Houeida Anouar, who's in charge of coordinating its editorial teams.
To kick off HuffPost Morocco, we are featuring a range of bloggers. There's journalist and photographer Leïla Ghandi on the need for gender equality in Morocco and for more women in leadership positions; Morocco's leading anti-corruption official, Abdesselam Aboudrar, on the necessity and challenges of fighting corruption; and Chafik Chraibi, the president of the Moroccan Association for the Fight Against Clandestine Abortion, on the consequences of unwanted pregnancies and illegal abortions. We also have contributions from Laila Ouachi, a former advisor to Morocco's prime minister; Laïla Marrakchi, one of the country's most successful filmmakers; psychologist and TV host Aboubakr Harakat; Hit Radio CEO Younes Boumehdi; and Faouzi Skali, a co-founder of the Festival of Sacred Music.
To Moroccan readers and those around the world who are interested in Morocco and its rich culture, please email editor-in-chief Hassan Hamdani at hassan.hamdani@huffingtonpost.com and join the conversation. So Marhaba, Morocco, and welcome to the HuffPost family!

America s 10 Worst LGBT Work Insultsreddit
The world's first report on measuring the value of LGBT workplace diversity in dollar terms is about to be released.
The new report, " LGBT Diversity: Show Me the Business Case ," reveals that companies that bother to invest resources in making workplaces more welcoming and comfortable for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender staff can realize big returns, from increasing productivity to reducing exits by LGBT staff who feel uncomfortable.
In the UK this is a big issue , and as you will see below, it is also a major issue in the U.S.
It costs a lot to replace lost staff, so this new report is timely -- and important -- for American business.
This latest pre-release data for the U.S. from the largest global LGBT research initiative, LGBT2020 , reveals what life in 2014 is like for LGBT Americans at work.
And, unfortunately, the news from the U.S. workplace is not that good.
It's Not a "Lifestyle"; It's a Life
Sometimes progress is hard to judge when we only have our own experiences to measure against. Life can seem fine or rather bleak, depending on what happens in our daily lives.
Learning from others' experiences is incredibly insightful -- and empowering.
It may surprise you, for example, to learn that 9 percent of respondents to the U.S. LGBT2020 research sample reported that they have been refused goods or services in the past 12 months because they were perceived to to be lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.
Almost one in eight (12 percent) reported having been harassed by a neighbor, and 7 percent reported having been physically attacked.
Four out of every 10 respondents (40 percent) were verbally abused at least once last year for being LGBT.
And one in every six respondents (16 percent) was harassed at work. To put that into perspective, America is home to more than 15 million LGBT people, with more than 10 million who are currently working full-time -- and almost 2.5 million LGBT Americans personally experienced harassment at work last year.  
But here is the worst part: The number of LGBT Americans who feel able to be out to everyone at work has gone down in the two years since Out Now 's last U.S. LGBT2020 sample and is now down to just 38 percent.
When we look at some of the insults being made in U.S. workplaces listed below, we start to understand why that number has fallen so low.
Hard Labor
The new report highlights new market data from 10 countries around the world.
Fewer than one in five LGBT workers in the U.S. (18 percent) agrees with the statement "This is a workplace entirely free from homophobia."
Almost one in two respondents (49 percent) saw or heard homophobic incidents last year.
Religious Intolerance
One of the key differences between the UK and U.S. samples in the LGBT2020 research is the far greater mentioning of religion that American respondents report.
Darren Cooper, a senior consultant with Out Now who is based in London, said the new U.S. results surprised him.
"In the UK we consider that religion has no practical place at work," Cooper says. "These latest findings from our LGBT2020 study for the U.S. show a vastly different situation to the UK. In the U.S. people feel much less able to be out with all their work colleagues, are more likely to have witnessed anti-LGBT remarks at work and, worryingly, have the added pressure of colleagues using religion to justify making insulting remarks. Many of these types of remarks would cause an outcry if they happened in a UK workplace."
Cooper cited as just one example the short but powerful remark made to a lesbian respondent: "I am praying for you."
"That comment is incredibly loaded, as it suggests the person that said it is a 'good' person, with the implication that the person being spoken to is 'bad' or 'wrong' in some way. These findings show there is an enormous amount of work still to do, around religion and also general workplace acceptance of LGBT people as equally respected employees in America's workplaces."
First, the Good News
It is not all bad news, though. Happily, some respondents -- a small minority, it must be admitted -- chose to comment positively on their workplaces.
Here are some of their remarks:
"Our GM in training is an out and proud lesbian woman and we have many, many out LGBT co-workers who are absolutely supported, including myself. I don't know about other locations in my company, but I know at mine, I'm a family member."
"I have worked for Bank of America for 18 years, they are GREAT on this topic and loads more."
"Everyone in the company I work for, has a 'live, and let live' philosophy."
"It's usually new people that don't know what to think about me. Like I'm going to hit on them or something. But they usually come around."
"A bi (but not out) staff member of mine has recently been bullied by his co-workers.  I as supervisor am in the process of investigating and will be disciplining offending staff, if not terminating them."
"Of the 60 staff members that work for my organization, 20 identify as LGBT.  I can say with integrity that there is not a homophobic bone in this organisation's body."
The 10 Worst Anti-LGBT Work Insults in the U.S.
We have left out of the list below numerous examples of people reporting what they saw as "normal" workplace banter, such as " That's so gay ," "f*ggot" and various other examples of name calling.
These are just 10 of the hundreds of comments made to this year's LGBT2020 research by U.S. respondents, who chose to write -- in their own words -- what is happening right now in their workplaces.
"Room for improvement" is an understatement.
"I can't add your wife to your health insurance because your marriage isn't 'real'"
"It's just a decision, I don't support the choice to be unnatural. Just be straight like the rest of us"
"You are not angry enough to be a real lesbian: you're not like the other girl who works here"
"I would just like to round up the people suffering like you and shoot them all, or to torture you -- just to make fun of you"
"People like you can't be a Christian, you're a sinner but I love you despite your choices"
"Now you and that other f*g can add your boyfriends to the work medical plans, that way when you get AIDS you will all be covered"
"I don't like those kind of people with 'scary' sexual preferences"
"Please, I don't want to hear the details of your lifestyle"
"That patient is gay and HIV+, why isn't he in some kind of isolation"
"You will burn down the gates of hell for being gay"
Out Now will be presenting key findings from this new report in a "Global Series" workshop at the 16th Out & Equal Workplace Summit in San Francisco at Moscone West Convention Center on Thursday, Nov. 6.
To request a free copy of the new "LGBT Diversity: Show Me the Business Case" report, just fill in this form and Out Now will send you a copy when released.

Scott Brown s Latest Endorsement Signals Trouble For Jeanne Shaheenreddit
Republican Scott Brown's bid to return to the U.S. Senate received a boost on Tuesday when he received the endorsement of Bob Preston, a onetime Democratic leader of the New Hampshire State Senate.
Preston, who served in the state Senate in the 1970s and 1980s, announced his support for Brown in an open letter that criticizes incumbent Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen for "her blind allegiance to the Obama administration." The letter accuses Shaheen of working with President Barack Obama to drive up the national debt. Preston also says that Shaheen has been unable to address problems such as controversies at the Department of Veterans Affairs and the IRS, as well as the country's immigration crisis.
Brown, he adds, would bring "common sense and independence" to Washington. "I believe his public service, his many years in the military, and a family person himself qualify him to be our next U.S. Senator," Preston writes. "I believe his leadership and decision-making will change the course of this country for the better."
The endorsement from Preston, who spent 18 years in the state Senate, comes as Shaheen struggles to maintain her lead over Brown in the final days before the election. HuffPost's Pollster average, which combines all publicly available polling, shows Shaheen ahead by just two points, a margin that has shrunk considerably in recent weeks.
Even more problematic for Shaheen is the fact that Preston's letter supports Brown's strategy of linking her to Obama, whose favorability remains at an all-time low in New Hampshire. Brown, who previously served as a senator from Massachusetts, has sought to cast himself as an independent . Support for Brown from an influential name like Preston can only do further damage to Shaheen at a time when she can least afford to take a hit.
Brown isn't the first Republican candidate endorsed by Preston in recent years. In 2012, Preston endorsed GOP candidate Ovide Lamontagne for governor of New Hampshire.
Shaheen touted her own endorsement from a member of the opposing party on Tuesday. Amy LaBelle, a small business owner who is a registered Republican, said Shaheen is the "clear choice" at an event in Amherst.
"Scott Brown’s record shows that he’s only interested in himself and in the big money corporate donors who fund his campaign," LaBelle said at the event, which was part of a statewide get out the vote tour by Shaheen.
Read Preston's full letter endorsing Brown below:
This coming election on November 4th is critical and an opportunity to change the direction of this country. Lack of leadership and decision making in Washington makes us look like a rudderless ship on domestic and international waters. It is time to change.
Once looked up as the strongest and most respected democracy in the world, we are now scoffed at by some world leaders.
Domestically, scandals occur in the Veterans Administration. Corruption has been uncovered in the IRS. No action has been taken to address the immigration problem. U.S. citizens forced into a health program against their wished that cost them more money as the administration walks us toward socialized medicine.
With all due respect to Senator Shaheen, she has not been able to address these problem and has gone along to get along with President Obama increasing the budget deficit until each American family is not in debt nationally in excess of $150,000.
Mrs. Shaheen served the state of New Hampshire well as state senator and governor, and I commend her for that. However, her blind allegiance to the Obama administration has resulted in the problems our nation faces today.
As a veteran, a former state senator, a businessman, and family man proud of New Hampshire and our country, I am looking for a change in leadership in Washington.
For those reasons, I urge voters to support Scott Brown for U.S. Senator on November 4th.
I believe his public service, his many years in the military, and a family person himself qualify him to be our next U.S. Senator. I sincerely believe his common sense and independence in Washington will be better for New Hampshire and our nation. I believe his leadership and decision-making will change the course of this country for the better.
I encourage citizens to get out and vote on November 4th and cast your vote for Scott Brown.
Sincerely,
Bob Preston
Hampton, N.H.

Iraqi Kurdish Fighters Head To Syria s KobaniIraqi Kurdish Peshmerga Head To Syria's Kobani

ARBIL, Iraq/MURSITPINAR, Turkey, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Iraqi  peshmerga fighters headed for the Syrian town of Kobani on  Tuesday to help fellow Kurds repel an Islamic State advance that  has defied U.S.-led air strikes and become an important test of  the coalition's ability to combat the Sunni insurgents.
Kobani, nestled on the border with Turkey, has been besieged  by Islamic State for more than a month. Weeks of air strikes on  the insurgents' positions and the deaths of hundreds of their  fighters have failed to break the siege.
Islamic State has caused international alarm by capturing  large expanses of Iraq and Syria, declaring an Islamic  "caliphate" erasing borders between the two and slaughtering or  driving away Shi'ite Muslims, Christians and other communities  who do not share their ultra-radical brand of Sunni Islam.
The Islamic State (IS) has threatened to massacre Kobani's  defenders in an assault which has sent almost 200,000 Syrian  Kurds fleeing to Turkey, and triggered a call to arms from Kurds  across the region.
Hemin Hawrami, a senior official in the Kurdistan Democratic  Party in Iraq, wrote on his Twitter feed that peshmerga  combatants were flying from Arbil airport in northern Iraq to  Turkey, from where they would travel overland to Kobani.
Saleh Moslem, co-chair of the Syrian Kurdish Democratic  Union Party (PYD), said later that around 150 peshmerga had  entered Turkey from Iraq and were expected to reach the area of  Kobani later on Tuesday night.
A Kurdish television channel showed footage of what it said  was a convoy of peshmerga vehicles in northern Iraq loaded with  weapons and on their way to the besieged town.
"We welcome the deployment of peshmerga fighters and weapons  from the Kurdistan Region to Kobani, which began this evening,"  Brett McGurk, a deputy envoy tasked by U.S. President Barack  Obama with building a coalition against IS, said on Twitter.
The Iraqi Kurdish region's parliament voted last week to  deploy some peshmerga to Syria although a Kurdish government  spokesman later said they would not engage in direct combat in  Kobani but rather provide artillery support.
Kurdistan's Minister of Peshmerga, Mustafa Sayyid Qader,  told local media on Tuesday that no limits had been set to how  long the forces would remain in Kobani.
The fighting around Kobani has exacerbated the flow of  refugees from Syria's 3 1/2-year civil war, with more than three  million people already sheltering in neighboring countries  including Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey.
Jordan's foreign minister warned on Tuesday the huge demand  for housing, schools, jobs and health care generated by the  refugees meant Syria's neighbors were reaching the limits of  their ability to cope.
GROUND TROOPS
Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said earlier that air  strikes alone would not be enough to push back the insurgents  and that only the peshmerga and moderate Syrian rebel forces  could oust Islamic State from Kobani.
"Saving Kobani, retaking Kobani and some area around Kobani  from ISIS, there's a need for a military operation," he said in  an interview with the BBC broadcast on Tuesday. But he made  clear neither Turkey nor Western allies would commit troops.
"If they (international coalition) don't want to send their  ground troops, how can they expect Turkey to send Turkish ground  troops with the same risks on our border?" Davutoglu said.
Turkish officials have rebuffed international criticism over  their reluctance to do more to help Kobani's beleaguered Kurdish  defenders, whom they accuse of being linked to the militant  Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought a decades-long  insurgency against the Turkish state.
That stance has enraged Turkey's own Kurdish minority -  about a fifth of the population and half of all Kurds across the  region. Kurds suspect Ankara would rather see Islamic State  jihadists extend their territorial gains than allow Kurdish  insurgents to consolidate local power.
Turkey has repeatedly called for a long-term strategic plan  for Syria involving the removal of President Bashar al-Assad  from power, fearing that Assad's forces or Kurdish militants  will fill the void if Islamic State is neutralized.
Iran accused Turkey on Tuesday of prolonging the three-year  armed conflict in Syria by insisting on Assad's overthrow and  supporting "terrorist groups" in Syria.
After pressure from Western allies, Turkey last week agreed  to let peshmerga forces from Iraq traverse its territory to  reach Kobani as its preferred alternative to U.S. planes  air-dropping weapons to Kurdish fighters in the town.
"The only way to help Kobani, since other countries don't  want to use ground troops, is sending some peace-oriented or  moderate troops to Kobani. What are they? Peshmerga ... and Free  Syrian Army (Syrian opposition forces)," Davutoglu said.
Davutoglu renewed calls for the United States to train and  arm fighters from the Free Syrian Army (FSA), a loose,  disorganized coalition of groups who have been battling Assad  and who have long been supported by Turkey.
Washington has committed to arming the Syrian opposition to  fight Islamic State, but U.S. officials remain concerned about  identifying effective, moderate groups in the increasingly  sectarian Syrian conflagration.

This Is How Easy It Is To Pirate Games On The 3DSreddit
Nintendo's popular 3DS video game system may have a new piracy problem.
A video posted on YouTube on Friday, which you can see above, shows off a new cartridge that, when inserted into the 3DS handheld, lets you play illegally downloaded games with the touch of a button. It's called the Sky3DS, and it's the latest so-called "flashcard" that lets gamers play pirated games without paying a cent. It’s expected to hit the market in one to two weeks, and it's child's play to set up.
Here's why Nintendo should worry: The 3DS was the top-selling console in America last year , with more than 11.5 million units sold since its 2011 release. In total, the 3DS has sold more than 44 million units worldwide ( PDF ). It's considerably more successful than Nintendo's Wii U system, which is struggling to find a place in the market. The Sky3DS, though a niche product that needs to be ordered online, could cut into game sales that last year alone amounted to more than 16 million games globally . Games cost anywhere from $29.99 to $49.99 in the United States.
Most worrisome is the device's simplicity. According to the video, you pop a MicroSD memory card loaded with games into the Sky3DS cartridge, power the 3DS on, and open your software. It’s that easy, and the flashcard reportedly works on any 3DS unit, including the newer, budget-priced 2DS and forthcoming “New 3DS” consoles. Here's how it works: First, one has to find a site that hosts ROM files—game data ripped from a cartridge and uploaded to a computer—to download and put on a MicroSD card. The rest is easy:
1. Insert the MicroSD card loaded with games into the flashcard.
2. Pop the flashcard into your 3DS and power on.
3. Select your game and open it.
The process is practically the same as booting up a legally purchased 3DS game.
Flashcards — also called flash carts — have long been a thorn in Nintendo’s side. They’re available for the old Nintendo DS handhelds, which officially became obsolete when Nintendo shut down their online services earlier this year. They're also available for the even-more-retro Game Boy Advance. In each iteration, the premise is the same: Download a bunch of games for free onto one cartridge and go nuts with all the Mario Kart and Pokemon you can stomach.
Nintendo until now skirted the issue on the 3DS with regular system updates. Though flashcards have popped up before, the Japanese game company whack-a-moled them with a system update that rendered them mostly useless . Essentially, Nintendo's overhaul of the system's settings interfered with software that previous flashcards needed to run.
The Sky3DS, on the other hand, says it supports the newest version of Nintendo's hardware, which means any game released up until now will work on the flashcard as long as the user can find the files online. Plus, it doesn't appear to require any software hacks, unlike other such devices: The Sky3DS reportedly works after simply slotting it into the 3DS like a game. That could make it harder for Nintendo to combat.
To put Nintendo's problem in perspective, illegal downloads of last year’s popular Pokemon X and Y games have exceeded 527,000 on a popular ROM site, according to publicly available stats. For a thought experiment, imagine if each of those downloads represented a unique user who could have bought the games for $39.99 a pop: That’s a potential (if exaggerated) loss of $21,074,730 in revenue from two games alone.
Nintendo and Sky3DS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Lava Burns First Structure On HawaiiLava Now Just Yards Away From Hawaii Home

This Oct. 25, 2014 photo provided by the U.S. Geological Survey shows lava flow advancing across the pasture between the Pahoa cemetery and Apaa Street, engulfing a barbed wire fence, near the town of Pahoa on the Big Island of Hawaii. Dozens of residents in this rural area of Hawaii were placed on alert as flowing lava continued to advance. Authorities on Sunday, Oct. 26, 2014 said lava had advanced about 250 yards since Saturday morning and was moving at the rate of about 10 to 15 yards an hou
PAHOA, Hawaii (AP) — After weeks of slow, stop-and-go movement, a river of asphalt-black lava destroyed a wooden shed Tuesday as it crept closer to homes in a Big Island community.
The lava flow easily burned down the empty shed at about 7:30 a.m., several hours after entering a residential property in Pahoa Village, said Hawaii County Civil Defense Director Darryl Oliveira.
A branch of the molten stream was less than the length of a football field from a two-story house. It could hit the home later Tuesday if it continues on its current path, Oliveira estimated.
Residents of Pahoa Village, the commercial center of the island's rural Puna district south of Hilo, have had weeks to prepare for what's been described as a slow-motion disaster. Most have either already left or are prepared to go.
At least 50 or 60 structures — including homes and businesses — are in the area likely to be hit.
Imelda Raras lives on Apaa Street, which was hit by the lava Sunday. She and her husband are ready to go to a friend's home if officials tell them they should leave.
"We are still praying," Raras said. "I hope our home will be spared."
On Tuesday morning, civil defense officials said the lava was about 500 yards from Pahoa Village Road, which runs through downtown and is one of the town's main roads.
Josiah Hunt, who has farm in a part of Puna that is not immediately threatened, described smelling burning grass, feeling warmth from the lava and hearing "popping and sizzling and all the methane bursts that are happening in the distance ... mixed with the birds chirping and the coqui frogs."
SLOW-MOTION DISASTER
Scientists began warning the public about the lava from Kilauea volcano Aug. 22. At the time, residents were cleaning up from a tropical storm that made landfall over the Puna district.
The flow's advance has been inconsistent, ranging from about 2 to 20 yards per hour, depending on topography, said Janet Babb, a spokeswoman for the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory.
The couple living in the house closest to the flow evacuated but have returned periodically to gather belongings, Oliveira said. At one point they allowed civil defense workers to view the lava from their balcony.
A branch of the lava flow was about 100 yards from the house Tuesday, while the "flow front" was about 200 yards from another home on the property.
Raras said she and her husband began putting their belongings in storage in September. What they can't take with them, they're photographing for insurance purposes.
WATCHING THE FLOW
County officials are making arrangements for those living in the lava's path to be able to watch the flow destroy their homes as a means of closure.
"You can only imagine the frustration as well as ... despair they're going through," Hawaii County Civil Defense Director Darryl Oliveira said.
Hunt watched last week as the lava crept toward Pahoa and saw a woman whose house is near its path put a lei at the front of the flow. "It helps a person come to grips with the reality of the situation," he said. "I found it to be oddly comforting in a really strange way."
PREPARATIONS
Some area schools are closing this week and sending their students to a temporary facility and to other area schools.
Crews have been building alternate roads to town, and officials are preparing for the lava to cut off access for some residents who are assigned to vote Nov. 4 at the Pahoa Community Center.
The center will remain open for voting for those who can reach it. Those living on the north side of the flow who are assigned to the center can instead go to the Hawaiian Paradise Community Center.
Voters also can cast ballots early by going to the Nanawale Community Center until Friday.
THE BRIGHT SIDE?
Terri Mulroy, who runs Kumu Aina Farm with her husband, said the lava flow, while unnerving, has a cleansing quality to it because it keeps development on the lush Hawaiian island in check.
"If it wasn't for the flow, I wouldn't be able to live here," she said. "This land would have been a golf course for the rich."

More than global cues, government action to determine market movement in near term: P Phani Sekhar
ET Now Oct 29, 2014, 08.54PM IST

P Phani Sekhar
(More is in the pipeline.…)
In a chat with ET Now, P Phani Sekhar , Fund Manager-PMS at Angel Broking, shares his views on the market as well as some sectors and stocks. Excerpts:
ET Now: For the moment, it appears that the markets are drifting. Do you think they could drift more?
P Phani Sekhar: I think they could drift more for the simple reason that you do not have any great global cues. On Thursday, you would have the first indication of what the FED is most likely to do on interest rates. But again, my own expectation is that for the next six months or so, there would not be any change in interest rates.
Globally, the slowdown in growth rates has dampened the sentiment quite a bit, but that is more or less factored in risk assets. You have commodities that have corrected significantly, you have equity markets that have been volatile. But the action is actually in India and I strongly believe that our future in the next six months in terms of equity markets will be more determined by what New Delhi does than what happens across the globe.
To that extent, if we are holding ourselves around 8000 levels on the Nifty, it is mainly due to the strong reform measures that the government has started initiating in the last 10 days or so. As per all media reports, more is in the pipeline. As long as that happens, even if the global environment remains a little subdued, we should be reasonably okay.
ET Now: What do you make of the pharma numbers so far? With the exception of Ranbaxy, there is no good news. Do you think pharma stocks run the risk of underperformance?
P Phani Sekhar: The initial reaction to the numbers has been negative. That is expected, but the overall long-term story for them still remains intact. More importantly, pharma is deriving advantage because of the TINA factor. You still do not have the conviction in the infrastructure-led stories, which is a large part of the market if it blooms, for people to start pulling their money out of the consumer and pharma names and start deploying their money in those sectors.
While it is true that a lot of midcaps in the infra sector have run up, conviction is still low there. As long as conviction remains low in those sectors, I guess the pharma stocks will continue to maintain their premium multiples. Hence, I do not think of any meaningful underperformance from these stocks going forward and on lower levels - maybe another 3 to 5 per cent from these levels - you will find renewed buying interest.
ET Now: What is it that you have made of the banking pack and the move on the banking stocks of late? Today you are seeing some profit-taking setting in. Is it time to revisit some of the PSU names perhaps?
P Phani Sekhar: We have always been sceptical about PSU names. All private banks have held their own. To that extent, we have no concern out there. The story remains one of conviction, which is that you go and buy private banks. If it declines, there will be better margin of safety for you. As far as PSU banks were concerned, while the structural concerns remained, the only silver lining this quarter has been their investment book. That again seems to be dwarfed by the kind of asset quality concerns that you have started seeing.
Thus, the asset quality concern seems to be a recurring theme. While you do not have any fresh slippages, what is happening is whatever they had restructured in the last two years, those assets are struggling to become standard assets. You are facing fresh slippages from the restructured basket. Thus, more or less, the story remains the same and I feel that although the stocks remain optically cheap, it is not a good idea to get into PSU banks.
ET Now: Why are IT stocks suffering? There was nothing wrong with the numbers. In fact, most of the IT companies have gone on record saying that FY15 will be better than FY14, but the markets are not paying any attention to that management commentary. What do you think?
P Phani Sekhar: It is a bit surprising. However, the IT valuations again are reasonable or are fair. They are not as premium as pharma or consumer names, nor are they very cheap. What has happened in IT is, here is a story of relative disappointments both in the case of HCL Tech as well as TCS which had made themselves sort of invincible when it came to beating industry consensus growth for many quarters now. Hence, when you saw more human performance from TCS and HCL Tech, the market got disappointed. At the same time if you see, Infosys has still done well because, on a relative basis, it did well compared to its tepid expectations.

(They are doing this by investing…)
NEW DELHI: Banks in emerging countries such as India, Brazil, Malaysia and Russia are more likely to have an innovation strategy in place and invest in R&D so as to become innovation leaders, says an Infosys-Efma study.
The sixth annual study, titled 'Innovation in Retail Banking 2014', surveyed over 100 retail banks around the world.
The report found that more banks in fast growing and rapidly developing markets are displaying greater ambition for becoming innovation leaders in delivering superior customer value.
They are doing this by investing more in research and development compared to their peers in mature markets, the report added.
"Banks are most concerned by the threat from technology companies entering the market (for example Google, Apple and Facebook ). The threat from this type of competitor was rated high by 45 per cent of banks and has increased in the last 12 months," the report said.
After technology companies, the most significant threat is perceived to come from telcos and from start-ups, it added.
As part of their innovation strategies, 26 per cent of banks surveyed said they are investing in start-ups.
Many banks organise their innovation activities around specific themes. Mobility is currently the most important theme with 88 per cent of banks rating the importance as 'high', followed closely by Big Data (67 per cent) and 'Social Channels (63 per cent).
Over 70 per cent of banks perceive mobile payments and services on multiple devices to be of high importance for delivering customer value in the mobile channel, it added.
"In times of continued pressure on profitability, there is no let-up in the demand from customers for innovative products and services. Many banks in rapidly growing emerging markets, who are used to generating profits from customers with smaller transaction values, are at the forefront of innovation in retail banking," Infosys Senior Vice President and Global Head of Finacle Michael Reh said.
Lessons on innovation from these banks could be extremely valuable to financial institutions around the world as they compete with new players in the market, Reh added.

BANGALORE: After the Mars orbiter spacecraft's successful encounter with comet Siding Spring last week, a major hurdle was over and the satellite is now in a normal phase of the mission to proceed with other experiments, ISRO said today.
"One thing that was quite satisfying was the satellite survived this comet, there was absolutely no problem...; it happened between October 19 and 20th, it has been about ten days since then, things are going on very correctly as planned," ISRO Satellite Centre (ISAC) Director S K Shivakumar told reporters here.
Speaking at the pre-event press meet of Engineers' Conclave, he said, "We are very satisfied with the way in which we have manoeuvred the satellite and how it behaved pre and post manoeuvre, and how it survived from the comet. With that, one major hurdle is really finished now we are more concentrating on the experiments we are trying to do."
"Things are going as per schedule, things are very clear for us and we are conducting the experiments as planned. With that we feel it is at normal face of the mission, and we can certainly hand over the satellite to our ISTRAC friends for next six months minimum, beyond that it will be really bonus to all of us," he said.
The comet, known as Siding Spring (C/2013 A1), made its closest encounter with Mars on October 19th midnight for which ISRO had repositioned its Mars Orbiter satellite to avoid collision.

The Fed is seen likely to announce that it will no longer add to its holdings of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities after it ends a two-day policy meeting later on Wednesday
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW YORK: US stocks were little changed on Wednesday as a drop in basic materials shares offset gains in the energy sector, with traders looking ahead to a statement from the US Federal Reserve as it winds down its stimulus program.
The Nasdaq Composite was pressured by a decline in Facebook shares as investors fretted over its spending plans.
DuPont, down 2 per cent at $66.62, was the largest drag on the materials sector of the S&P 500 after it said there were "competitive advantages" in keeping its businesses together. Activist investor Nelson Peltz has urged DuPont to separate its various businesses in a move that has supported the company's shares.
Equities mostly held on to recent gains, with the S&P 500 up 6.6 per cent in the last nine sessions as earnings have mostly been strong. So far this reporting season, 73.5 per cent of S&P 500 companies have exceeded profit expectations. In a typical quarter since 1994, 63 per cent of companies beat estimates, according to Thomson Reuters data.
"The trend today is company-specific," said Kim Forrest , senior equity research analyst, Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.
She said the takeaway from a glut of company calls is "the US is the best house in an ugly neighborhood and that doesn't seem to be abating."
At 11:48 a.m. GMT (1548 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average rose 14.51 points, or 0.09 per cent, to 17,020.26, the S&P 500 gained 0.59 points, or 0.03 per cent, to 1,985.64 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 19 points, or 0.42 per cent, to 4,545.30.
The Fed is seen likely to announce that it will no longer add to its holdings of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities after it ends a two-day policy meeting later on Wednesday, effectively ending a program that at its peak pumped $85 billion a month into the financial system.
Facebook Inc shares fell 6.1 per cent to $75.84 the day after the social network announced an increase in spending in 2015 and projected a slowdown in revenue growth this quarter.
Hershey Co shares fell 3.3 per cent to $92.37 after the chocolate maker cut its full-year earnings and revenue growth forecasts, citing higher dairy prices, a stronger dollar and weak sales growth in some markets.
Shares of American Realty Capital slid 35.6 per cent to $7.97 after it said some of its previous financial statements were unreliable.
Orbital Sciences Corp shares fell 15.9 per cent to $25.54 a day after its unmanned rocket exploded seconds after liftoff from a commercial launch pad in Virginia, marking the first accident since NASA turned to private operators to deliver cargo to the International Space Station. Orbital Sciences is in the midst of merging with Alliant Techsystems' aerospace and defense division, and its shares fell 3 per cent to $125.93.

The Secret to Success in an Interim Leadership Rolereddit
Woe unto the interim leader. Must be strategic. But may not be the one who sees the strategy through. Must build the organization. But may be building it for someone else. Must manage the operations. But unpopular edicts can be delayed until the permanent leader shows up. As an interim leader, expect to deal with open hostility and passive aggressive behavior on a regular basis. The secret to success is to engage fully with the work itself while eschewing the perks of the job. Maximize the impact. Minimize the damage.
Let's back up. First, try to get clarity on whether interim means "holding the fort until we find the right person, which absolutely will not be you," "on probation with a good chance of becoming permanent," or "doing the job as a developmental opportunity on the way to something else." In either case, engaging fully with the work itself while eschewing the perks of the job implies focusing your efforts on the least prestigious, highest impact tasks and leaving the glory to others.
Yours to lose
Patty had delivered in every job she'd had at the firm for 15 years. When her boss was moved to head a different division, senior management asked her to step in as interim division president while they did a thorough internal and external search for the new president.
Patty kept doing exactly what she'd been doing. She finished the year's strategic planning and got senior management excited about her plans. She kept managing operations -- and delivering her numbers. She kept moving ahead with the organizational evolution she and her previous boss had put in place, inspiring and enabling all -- without moving into her previous boss's office or taking his title. This minimized envy from others on the team.
In the end, senior management would have looked silly picking anyone but her for the role. It turned out Patty was on probation. Her approach and results were entirely appropriate for someone on probation and were a big part of why she got the permanent role.
Not yours
We often suggest leaders of change bring in fall guys. Change agents often don't survive the change they need to instill. The reason is that the changes they make inevitably result in pain and suffering for a lot of people. The leader becomes the symbol of the change -- and of all the pain. When the change is complete, the survivors may not be able to disassociate the leader from their pain and may not be able fully to trust that the leader has their best interests at heart.
Fall guys deflect this. By bringing in someone to spearhead the change, the leader can avoid being the symbol of the pain. Once the change is complete the leader can dismiss the person spearheading the effort and say something like "Now that we're rid of that awful person, we can back to doing what we do best: serving customers and building the business." Outside consultants are great for this task. Alternately you can bring an interim change leader.
If you're that interim change leader, know that you're not going to survive. Make sure you're compensated for what you do, not for the long-term results you enable. (You're not likely to be around to see those rewards.) Think cash and bonus. Not equity.
In any interim role that you know is not going to be permanent, you need an exit plan. Could be a role reporting to the person that takes over for you. Could be a different role somewhere else in the organization. Could be a role with a different organization. Either way, make sure you know what's going to happen when your interim role comes to an end -- which it will.
BRAVE Interim Management
Environment: Understand the context including whether the job is yours to lose or not yours.
Values: Understand what matters and why -- what you must accomplish and what principles you cannot violate.
Attitude: Adopt the right attitude for the situation, making appropriate strategic, posture and cultural choices.
Relationships: Whether the leadership role is permanent of interim, the heart of leadership is always connecting with other.
Behaviors: In an interim role think in terms of two time-frames for impact: things that impact current results and things that lay the foundation for future results.

Bangladesh Islamist Party Chief Sentenced To DeathMotiur Rahman Nizami, Bangladesh Islamic Party Chief, Sentenced To Death For War Crimes
 | By                                                                JULHAS ALAM

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — A special tribunal sentenced the leader of Bangladesh's largest Islamist party to death on Wednesday for atrocities and multiple killings during the nation's independence war against Pakistan in 1971.
Motiur Rahman Nizami, 71, sat calmly in the dock as the head of a three-judge panel, M. Enayetur Rahim, read the verdict in the packed courtroom in Dhaka, the capital. The defense said it would appeal.
Outside, police and paramilitary units patrolled the streets because previous verdicts by the tribunal have sparked violence.
Nizami's Jamaat-e-Islami party denounced the verdict in a statement and called a general strike for Thursday, Sunday and Monday. Friday and Saturday make up the weekend in Bangladesh.
Nizami, a former Cabinet minister, was tried on 16 charges, including genocide, murder, torture, rape and destruction of property. He was accused of personally carrying out or ordering the deaths of nearly 600 Bangladeshis.
Bangladesh says Pakistani soldiers, aided by local collaborators, killed 3 million people, raped 200,000 women and forced about 10 million people to take shelter in refugee camps across the border in neighboring India during the nine-month war.
The prosecution said Nizami acted as the supreme commander of the Al-Badr militia, which carried out a systematic plan to torture and execute pro-liberation supporters during the war, including teachers, engineers and journalists.
The group is blamed for killing dozens of people by kidnapping them from their homes just before Pakistan surrendered to a joint force of India and Bangladesh on Dec. 16, 1971. At that time, Nizami was also the president of Islami Chhatra Sangha, the student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami, in what was previously called East Pakistan.
Asif Munier, the son of a university teacher and a prominent writer who was killed in 1971, said he and his family had been waiting for this for 43 years.
"I want the verdict be implemented soon," Munier said.
The Jamaat-e-Islami party openly campaigned against independence and its then-leader, Ghulam Azam, toured the Middle East to mobilize support for Pakistan, but the party has denied committing atrocities. Azam was sentenced last year for similar crimes and died naturally in a hospital prison cell on Oct. 23.
Two special tribunals set up by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to try people for war crimes have delivered 10 verdicts. One senior leader of Jamaat-e-Islami party has already been hanged for his role in killing people in 1971.
Nizami was a Cabinet minister during former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia's last term in 2001-2006.

MILAN: Fiat Chrysler said on Wednesday it would spin off luxury carmaker Ferrari and list a 10 percent stake on the market as it seeks to raise funding for its ambitious 48-billion euro ($61 billion) growth plan.
The world's seventh-largest carmaker said the board had mandated its management to complete the spin-off next year. It said the remaining 90 percent would be distributed among FCA shareholders - who include the Agnelli family which founded Fiat.
The group, which moved its own primary listing to New York on Oct. 13, expects the Ferrari shares to be listed in the United States and possibly a European exchange.
"As we move forward to secure the 2014-2018 Business Plan and work toward maximizing the value of our businesses to our shareholders, it is proper that we pursue separate paths for FCA and Ferrari," FCA Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said in a statement.
FCA's Milan-listed shares, which fell after the company earlier reported third-quarter results and higher-than-expected debt, rose 5 percent before trading was suspended due to excessive volatility.

How to Have a Great Relationship and Businessreddit
My husband and I met on a business trip in 2007, and from the moment we met we were so damned HOT. We'd make out constantly and send mushy love letters and call and text each other nonstop. We'd stay on the phone for hours and hours and hours and send gifts... and the sex was in-cred-i-ble. We had a long distance relationship for awhile before I decided to make the move halfway across the country to be with him. I knew it wouldn't be easy, but I thought that we'd always find a way to be that couple who looked like they'd just started dating, even after years of marriage.
Despite our best laid plains, I was wrong as shit. Many "we need to talk" moments led me to my own startling realization that the crazy, blazing inferno that we once had, that had turned to a pile of barely glowing embers, was of my own doing.
When we first met, I was happy and free (as free as you can be as a single mom of two kids, anyway) and I had a career that was my own. I took care of myself and had my hair done regularly, toes and nails freshly painted, went on dates, made time with friends. I did what I wanted, with whom I wanted to do it with and I said what I wanted too, which made me a bit ballsy, decisive and untamed -- wildly attractive to my now-husband.
One of the things that made me so attractive to him back then was that I was witty and confident and I didn't take shit from people or care what they thought. I'm not that person anymore.
Maybe it was being a business owner, who worked from home like a crazy person and didn't have that face-to-face interaction every day with people, with actual adult conversation that made me less confident. Maybe it was the fucking countless hours of watching the Disney channel with two girls under five that's made me a great mom, but not a great sex kitten. Maybe it was never going out with friends and connecting with my inner girl, who just wanted to talk about hair and make-up and being a mom and how to have a sex life after kids that took my more ballsy edge off.
Maybe it was adding two kids to our already big, blended family or just being insanely busy all of the time, or not taking care of myself at the level I knew I should or not spending enough time with myself or feeling like I was "on" 24/7... whatever happened... I turned into a nagging, lifeless bitch without even knowing it. Not attractive to anyone, my husband and potential clients included.
It's amazing the spotlight that relationships (business or personal) will put on your weak spots. The weaknesses that are internal always manifest in ways that make you want to blame everyone around you. It was easy to blame my husband for not being the romantic sap that he used to be. It was hard to admit that I was not that fun-loving, ballsy sexpot that I once was.
It's no coincidence that my business wasn't doing so hot then either. I was working, working, working but nothing was happening to reflect that work. Nothing. No matter how many coaches I hired or courses I took or money I invested, results were sparse. My business was a spotlight on me, just like my relationship with my hubs.
All of this was a reflection of the inner me. People, whether a spouse or a client, can see right though you, no matter how well you think you hide it.
It takes guts to admit that and do something about it. But you must. If not, you'll always have a troubled relationship or a shitty biz or a not-so-fulfilled feeling about your life. You can blame your boss or your clients, husband or your kids but until you fix you, nothing will change no matter how many external shifts you make (divorce, job change, etc.).
It's easy to lose ourselves in the daily shit. It's easy to forget who we are beyond the job, family, business and miscellaneous mundane. So easy, in fact, that you might be like me and not even know that it's happening. I was so driven to succeed in business and be the best partner and the best mom and everything to everyone that I ended up sucking at everything because there was no fun, no joy, no me.
So how do you fix it? I started by doing things for myself again. Little things, at first, like painting my nails, listening to my favorite music and taking bubble baths. Then I started taking girls trips and having more fun every day, even if it meant dancing in my living room alone. Whatever lights you up, do more of that and stop being such a bitch.
Your partner and your clients will thank you.

The choice of the party for the big job was evident when Modi credited Fadnavis as being the ‘ideal MLA’ and a national asset
Upfront about his association with the Hindu nationalist organisation, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Maharashtra Chief Minister-elect Devendra Fadnavis said he owes “his values” to the organisation. In an interview to The Hindu hours before his formal election by his party legislators he said, “I believe, there cannot be any better values than the ones taught by the RSS. Contrary to what people say [implying criticism], anyone who imbibes the values of the RSS will do good work.”
It became evident that he was the choice of the party for the big job when Prime Minister Narendra Modi lavished praise on him at an election rally in Nagpur — crediting him as being the ‘ideal MLA’ and a national asset.
The setting for Mr. Modi’s comments was also symbolic — Nagpur is the headquarters of the RSS, and gives Maharashtra its first BJP Chief Minister.
“I imbibed the quality of nationalism from the RSS — integrity and the sentiment of ‘nation first.’ What else can be more important than that,” Mr. Fadnavis said.
Vajpayee is his political idol
Though Maharashtra Chief Minister-elect Devendra Fadnavis has credited the RSS for his “inspiration” and “values,” much of the moulding was done at home. His father, Gangadharrao Fadnavis, was a prominent RSS pracharak and a Jan Sangh member.
Mr. Fadnavis says his father taught him the art of building and maintaining “good relations.” “Even after his death, those relations are still intact,” he said.
Though his father was his personal idol, Mr. Fadnavis’ political idol was none other than the former BJP Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
“He [Mr. Vajpayee] is a person who gave you the feeling that he wouldn’t ever do anything that was wrong.”
Mr. Fadnavis himself boasts a hard-working character, is known to stay calm in torrid times and has exceptional oratory skills — a point acknowledged by even his opponents.
Noting his contribution in the Assembly, Speaker Dilip Walse Patil had remarked that with Mr. Fadnavis becoming an MLA, the country had lost a great lawyer.
 

Had a few drinks You may be allowed in metroHad a few drinks? You may be allowed in Delhi Metro
Faizan Haidar , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 30, 2014

In a move that spells relief for those returning home after having a few drinks, the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) has asked the Delhi metro to amend its act that says passengers in an inebriated state cannot travel by the metro.
In 2013, over 5,500 passengers were challaned and were asked to deboard the metro after they were found to be intoxicated.
The CISF’s crackdown on drunk passengers had raised questions as Delhi Police encourages use of public transport in their campaign against drunken driving.
After consulting seniors, the CISF has asked the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to prepare a guideline for passengers, who are drunk.
“Section 59 of the DMRC Act says passengers under the influence of alcohol should not be allowed to board the metro. We have requested them to change it and instead of barring every drunken passenger, those fit enough to walk or are accompanied by someone who is not drunk, should be allowed to travel by the metro. The decision should be taken by the person on frisking duty,” said a senior CISF official, requesting anonymity.
Since alcohol bottles are banned in the metro, the CISF feels banning drunk passengers will encourage drunken driving and result in road accidents.
 “If we find a passenger is misbehaving or may misbehave with fellow passengers during his journey, we can ask the passenger to deboard,” the official added.
The number of passengers caught in an inebriated state in 2013 has jumped 10 times against the previous year. While in 2012, only 591 passengers were caught travelling drunk on the Delhi metro, the number increased to 5,587 in 2013.
In 2011, Delhi Police had caught 107 passengers travelling in a drunken state. According to the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) Act, passengers found misbehaving under the influence of alcohol can be fined `250.
“If our staff on frisking duty finds a passenger is not in a condition to travel, he will be turned away from the gate itself. If the passenger objects, a breath analyser test will be conducted,” the official further said.

Centre submits list of 627 foreign account holders to SC  names to remain secretCentre gives black money full list to SC, names to remain secret
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 29, 2014
First Published: 09:16 IST(29/10/2014) | Last Updated: 10:13 IST(2/11/2014)
The government on Wednesday submitted a list of 627 Indians holding accounts in HSBC Bank, Geneva, to the Supreme Court, which directed its special investigating team (SIT) to examine them and take appropriate action.

Handing over a sealed envelope, attorney general Mukul Rohatgi said it contained three documents — the government’s correspondence with the French government, the list of names and a status report.
A special bench headed by Chief Justice of India HL Dattu refused to open the envelope, saying it would be done by the SIT chairman and vice-chairman. “We don’t want to open these papers and embarrass anyone. That has never been our intention,” it said.
Scheduling the next hearing for December 3, it asked the SIT to submit a status report by November 30 after ascertaining who had black money accounts abroad.
The Centre had on Monday disclosed eight names in an affidavit — including those of Dabur India promoter Pradip Burman, a bullion trader and the directors of a Goa mining company, all facing prosecution. Earlier, it had revealed 18 other names.
On Tuesday, the top court directed the government to submit the full list after the latter said it wasn’t possible to make the names of all foreign bank account holders public as all of them may not be guilty of tax evasion. Rejecting the Centre’s submission that such action would breach the privacy of legal account holders, the CJI said, “If it breaches confidentiality, let it be so.”
But on Wednesday, when Rohatgi asked him to open the sealed envelope, he refused to do so.
It was also not clear why the court insisted on getting the list from the government when the latter had submitted it to the court-appointed SIT in June.
Rohatgi told the court the details of account holders were for the year 2006. The data, stolen from HSBC in Geneva, were supplied to France, which passed it on to India in 2011. He said half the account holders were Indian residents who could be prosecuted under income tax laws and the rest were NRIs. Several have admitted to holding foreign accounts but maintain they have paid taxes, he added.
Rohatgi also told the court that most transactions had taken place during 1999 and 2000 and under law, the last date for completion and assessment of all cases was March 31, 2015. Under the IT Act, prosecution for tax evasion can be initiated up to 16 years after the offence.
According to SIT chairman MB Shah, the report submitted by the government has no new details, and the list was the same as the one given to it earlier this year. “We have to question the people named in it,” he told a TV channel.
“The probe is difficult. There is no eyewash. The report will take time. We have already filed the first report in August. I’m hopeful that we should be able to file the final report by next year,” he added.
The Centre, meanwhile, was allowed by the court to raise its objections against making all the names public before the SIT.
“The SIT is headed by two retired SC judges. They are not laymen. Tell them the problems you may face if the names are revealed and let the SIT take a decision on future course of action,” it said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi set up the SIT team comprising regulators and ex-judges to identify illicit fund-holders and repatriate money on the first day in office, as part of a wider clampdown on corruption that he promised during his election campaign.
The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had also accused the previous Congress government of failing to crack down on Indians parking billions of untaxed dollars abroad.
The issue of disclosing the names of foreign bank account holders hogged the political limelight recently, with Jaitley saying the opposition party would be embarrassed if such a revelation was made.
The Congress, on its part, asked the government to come out with complete information without indulging in "selective leaks" and pointed out that "the Congress is not going to be blackmailed under any such threat".
The NDA government said on Monday that Swiss authorities had agreed to provide information to help India investigate leaked accounts, after earlier saying such assistance would break Swiss law.
The court is hearing a public interest petition filed by former law minister Ram Jethmalani in 2009 seeking a direction to the Centre to bring back black money stashed by Indians abroad. Jethmalani had accused the government of attempting to shield powerful politicians and businessmen.
Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal has also filed an application requesting the court to hear him in the matter.
While there are no official estimates, Global Financial Integrity (GFI), a Washington-based think-tank, has estimated that Indians had salted away $462 billion (about 28 lakh crore in current exchange rates) in overseas tax havens between 1948 and 2008.
Black money arises mainly from incomes not disclosed to the government usually to avoid taxation, and, sometimes, because of its criminal links. About a third of India's black money transactions are believed to be in real estate, followed by manufacturing and shopping for gold and consumer goods.
The Congress, meanwhile, said the central government cannot take credit for revealing names of people holding black money abroad when it did so on a Supreme Court directive.
"It is wrong for anyone to take credit for anything that is (being done) by the order of the Supreme Court," party spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said.
The BJP's estranged ally Shiv Sena, too, credited the Supreme Court with bringing out the names in the first list in public domain.
 
"Blackmoney was made a major issue during the Lok Sabha elections (of 2014). The government will not understand how difficult it is to bring back the blackmoney stashed abroad. The Centre has only revealed three names, but the credit for that will go only to the Supreme Court," the Sena said in an editorial in its mouthpiece 'Saamana', describing the names revealed so far as only a 'tip of the iceberg'.
Continuing with his attack on the government, Kejriwal accused the Centre of sparing the big fish holding black money abroad.
"There should not be selective revelation of names. The big fish are being let off," he told the media.

Black money: India fails to attend meet on tax evasion | I-T to prosecute 300 a/c holdersberlin
(At the meeting of the OECD,…)
NEW DELHI/BERLIN: India today failed to attend an OECD meeting in Berlin where a multilateral agreement requiring a commitment to follow international standards of confidentiality for information received relating to black money was signed.
Official sources said that India was not able to attend the Berlin meeting where it was to sign a multilateral competent authority agreement and intended first information exchange date.
Government of India had to give an international commitment that it would follow international standards on information received. Late night reports indicate that India was not able to attend that meet, they said without citing any reasons for the absence.
At the meeting of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), 51 countries signed the agreement to share financial data and boost efforts to crack down on tax evasion.
The signatories to the agreement include most European Union nations as well as tax havens like Liechenstein, British Virgin Island and the Cayman Island. They will begin automatically exchanging data collected by financial institutions as early as 2017, the OECD said.
New Delhi also fears that treaties for exchange of information on black money holders with countries like USA, Germany and Switzerland may be delayed on grounds of breach of confidentiality if names of account-holders are disclosed improperly.
Government fears emanate against the backdrop of the raging debate in the country over disclosure of names of black money holders in foreign banks given by other governments and entities.
On a day the government provided to the Supreme Court a list of 627 individuals who have accounts in HSBC Bank, Geneva, government sources feared adverse consequences if the names get disclosed or come to public domain.
They point out that when the Supreme Court gave an order on May 1 this year asking for disclosure of 8 names, against whom investigations were concluded, to be given to petitioner Ram Jethmalani despite the fact that no evidence of wrong doing was found against them, there was a contradiction with an earlier order.
The Court had earlier in 2011 clearly stated that disclosure of names against whom no evidence of wrong-doing was found would lead to "dangerous circumstances".
It had also said that only after the state arrives as a prima facie conclusion of wrong doing based on material evidence only then would a question arise on the right of the public to be informed.
After the 8 names got into public domain, Germany wrote to India in June this year expressing surprise at this revelation and asked India to provide an explanation of how this information was disclosed.
Germany wrote that the information it had provided of Liechtenstein Bank account holders in March 2009 was clearly under tax treaty and was subject to confidentiality obligations.
Referring to interpretations that information received from foreign countries can be used in hearings before the Supreme Court, which is against the general and international understanding that confidentiality clause in the treaties provides for information which can only be used for tax purposes and assessment and enforcement.
The combined effect of all this was foreign countries with which India still does not have any treaty or arrangement to exchange information, or countries which shared some information had cold feet for further cooperation.
For example, sources said, India is set to sign the inter-governmental agreement (IGA) with the USA for automatic exchange of information and this IGA is also subject to confidentiality clause.
They feared that there may be delays in signing the IGA with USA if the interpretation of the confidentiality clause remains different from the international interpretation.
For signing the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement in Berlin, India had to give an international commitment that it would follow international standards for the information received.
Countries which have legally shared information with India so far have been under some treaty or agreement which contains confidentiality clause, the sources said adding there was no other way to obtaining information.

Malaysia PM Najib Razak vows to bring MH17 culprits to justiceMalaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak on Tuesday vowed to bring to justice the perpetrators of MH17.
By: Reuters | Dubai | Posted: October 28, 2014 11:24 pm
Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak on Tuesday vowed to bring to justice the perpetrators of the downing of Airlines MH17, but said he feared fighting in Ukraine might block access to the crash site.
In an interview with Reuters in Dubai, Razak also said he hoped to see results over the coming months in the search for missing Malaysian jetliner MH370, bringing closer a solution to the world’s greatest aviation mystery. The plane veered off course and disappeared without a trace earlier this year.
Malaysia has been hit by two unprecedented aviation disasters this year – flight MH370’s disappearance in March and the downing of flight MH17 over Ukraine in July. Najib told Reuters Malaysia was determined to continue its search for answers for both.
“We want to pursue this (MH17 investigation) until its logical conclusion, which is to bring to justice the people responsible,” said Razak, speaking on the sidelines of an Islamic finance conference.
“It’s going to be a long, drawn-out process. But we need to do this. We need to show that whoever did it must pay the price. Because you cannot bring down a civilian aircraft … even if you give an excuse that it was unintentional.”
MH17 was en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur with 298 mostly Dutch passengers aboard when, it is widely suspected, a surface-to-air missile shot it down. Kiev blames separatist rebels in east Ukraine and accuses Moscow of arming them. The rebels and Moscow deny the accusations.
CRITICISM
A report by the Dutch safety board said in September that MH17 crashed after a “large number of high-energy objects” penetrated its fuselage.
Dutch authorities leading the investigation of the crash have come under criticism in the Netherlands from relatives of victims and lawmakers, who say not enough progress has been made in identifying who downed the plane. Officials say cold weather and continuing hostilities are making progress slow.
“Factions are still fighting each other and there are too many splinter groups, making it very risky for us … we cannot get access to the crash site and that is very frustrating,” Razak said. “I don’t think what we’re doing is adequate enough.”
Local emergency services made a start in October, recovering personal belongings from the crash site, after Razak personally negotiated a deal with the rebels to allow access to the bodies of passengers. He said the bodies of all but one passenger had been secured now.
HOPE FOR MH370 PROBE
Razak said he expects some results in the search for the missing jetliner MH370 after new technology was deployed to scan the ocean bed.
More than two dozen countries have been involved in the air, sea and underwater search for the missing Boeing 777, but months of searches have failed to turn up any trace, even after the search area was continued…

Islamic State uses captive UK soldier as war correspondent in propaganda videoA captive British photojournalist has been used by the Islamic State group to take on the role of a war correspondent.
By: Associated Press | Posted: October 29, 2014 1:15 am
A captive British photojournalist has been used by the Islamic State group to take on the role of a war correspondent in the extremists’ latest propaganda video.
In the video, made public on Monday, John Cantlie calmly stands before a camera in what he identifies as the embattled Syrian town of Kobani. He asserts in the video that Islamic State group fighters have pushed deep into the town despite airstrikes by a US-led coalition and that they are winning the battle against Kurdish forces.
The strange spectacle of a prisoner who has admitted to being afraid for his life being used as a spokesman is the latest of example of the IS’s attention-getting approach to propagating its message and its threats.
The Associated Press could not independently verify the video as authentic, although some of the images, including footage the Islamic State group says was shot by a drone, appear to be Kobani, a town near the Turkish border. Sporadic gunfire can be heard in the background. At one point in the 5½-minute report, a Turkish flag can be seen flying atop a grain silo; Cantlie is not in the same shot.
Although it was unclear exactly when the video was recorded, Cantlie mentions specific news reports and statements by Western officials from as recently as last week.
“Without any safe access, there are no journalists here in the city,” Cantlie intones in the video. He wears black clothes and is bearded. In previous videos, he wore an orange jumpsuit — as did the hostages beheaded by the extremists.
IS militants launched an offensive on Kobani in mid-September, capturing dozens of Kurdish villages and entering parts of the town. The attack has displaced more than 200,000 people. American officials say the US has conducted dozens of airstrikes against the militants in and around the town, killing hundreds of Islamic State fighters.
In contrast to those accounts, Cantlie gave the IS’s different slant on the fighting.
“Airstrikes did prevent some groups of mujahedeen from using their tanks and heavy armor as they’d have liked, so they’re entering the city and using light weapons instead, going house to house,” Cantlie says in the video, a fly buzzing around his head. “The battle for Kobani is coming to an end,” he continues. “The mujahedeen are just mopping up now, street to street and building to building. … As you can hear, it is very quiet — just occasional gunfire.”
The video is entitled “Inside Ayn Al-Islam,” the name IS uses for Kobani. The Arabic name for the predominantly Kurdish town is Ayn al-Arab.
Since September, IS has used Cantlie as a public face.
“Now, I know what you’re thinking. You’re thinking he’s only doing this because he’s a prisoner. He’s got a continued…

Ebola vaccine trials to start in Switzerland this weekEbola vaccine trials are set to start in Switzerland this week after receiving the green light from authorities.
Geneva | Posted: October 29, 2014 12:25 am
Ebola vaccine trials are set to start in Switzerland this week after receiving the green light from the country’s authorities, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday.
Swiss regulators announced they would allow trials of an experimental vaccine made by Britain’s GlaxoSmithKine, and tests on some 120 individuals were set to get under way at the CHUV hospital in Lausanne Friday, the hospital said.
“We have never before received so many volunteers so quickly,” Blaise Genton, who heads CHUV’s infectious disease division, told reporters.
He said the volunteers, who must be between the ages of 18 and 65, were mainly medical students and would all receive 800 Swiss francs (USD 845, 665 euros) for their participation.
Genton stressed they would receive payment for their time, since they would be spending “numerous hours with us”.
Most of the volunteers will receive the experimental GSK vaccine called ChAd3, which is based on a genetically modified chimpanzee adenovirus, but 20 of them would receive a placebo he said.
WHO hailed the announcement.
“This marks the latest step towards bringing safe and effective Ebola vaccines for testing and implementation as quickly as possible,” the UN’s health agency said in a statement.
There is no licensed treatment or vaccine for the deadly Ebola virus, which has killed nearly 5,000 people in the outbreak centred in west Africa.
The experimental GSK vaccine is one of two considered particularly promising by WHO, and trials have already begun in Mali, Britain and the United States.
“The trial will test the safety of the vaccine and its capacity to induce an immune response,” WHO said.
It added that results of the trials in Switzerland and elsewhere will “provide the basis for planning subsequent trials involving several thousand participants, and for choosing vaccine dose-level for efficacy trials.”
A second experimental vaccine being fast-tracked on the WHO’s recommendation, Canadian-discovered rVSV, is set to soon start trials at the University Hospital of Geneva.
Trials of that potential vaccine have already begun in the United States and are also set to soon start in Germany, Gabon and Kenya.
“If shown to be safe and effective, either of the vaccines could be scaled up for production during the first quarter of next year, with millions of doses produced for wide distribution in high-risk countries,” WHO assistant director general Marie-Paule Kieny said in the statement.

To revive Left  steer clear of CongressAn alliance will damage CPM in its remaining bases, put Left unity under strain. (Source: PTI photo/PTI)
Written by Prasenjit Bose | Posted: October 29, 2014 12:54 am | Updated: October 29, 2014 6:38 am
The present state of the Left in India is a cause for concern, to not only those who are members of the mainstream communist parties but a much wider spectrum of people who are ideologically inclined towards the Left and want it to revive and flourish in order to strengthen secularism, democracy and social justice. The electoral debacle faced by the Left Front in the Lok Sabha polls, especially in its former stronghold of West Bengal, has naturally led to some churning and debate within the Left and its largest contingent, the CPM. The outcome of this debate would have a bearing on the future of the left movement as a whole.
While debating the causes of its decline, however, there is a tendency within the Left to start excavating the distant past, which only leads to endless hair-splitting without any worthwhile conclusions to pursue. For instance, why the communist movement split in the 1960s or the Left as a whole is faced with near extinction in the Hindi heartland are complex issues that do not offer easy answers. What is more relevant and urgent is to first preserve and strengthen the areas where the Left has had a strong presence till date and build up from there.
The main challenge before the CPM today is to stall and reverse its decline in West Bengal. The party has not only failed to recover from the 2011 assembly election defeat, but has continued to suffer a steady erosion of its mass base, progressively ceding even the opposition space to its principal ideological foe, the BJP. The Mamata Banerjee-led government stands thoroughly compromised today because of its outright treachery vis-à-vis the promise of “poriborton” — the change has clearly been for the worse, with corruption scandals, violence, atrocities against women and socio-economic decline engulfing the state. Yet, one has not witnessed a spirited effort by the CPM to raise people’s issues and build a credible, popular movement against the TMC regime. Rather, what is happening is a sharpening communal polarisation alongside the rise of the BJP, which threatens to squeeze the Left out of the political discourse.
The reason behind the inability of the CPM in effecting a turnaround in West Bengal is the obduracy of the party leadership in admitting their errors and ushering in much needed ideological-political and organisational changes. The wounds of Nandigram and Singur continue to fester without any remorse or policy rethink forthcoming from the former chief minister, who remains a permanent absentee from politburo and central committee meetings. The memories of undemocratic highhandedness and corruption under the Left regime refuse to die down in the absence of serious organisational rectification. Just the other day, a senior CPM state leader was interrogated by the CBI in continued…

The shadow over the dinner tablePrint
Written by Roger Cohen | Posted: October 29, 2014 12:21 am | Updated: October 29, 2014 6:40 am
I don’t know about you, but I find dinner conversations often veer in strange directions these days, like the friend telling me the other evening that the terrorists calling themselves Islamic State could easily dispatch one of their own to West Africa, make sure he contracts Ebola, then get him onto the London Underground or the Paris Metro or the New York subway, squeezed up against plenty of other folk at rush hour, and bingo!
“I mean,” he said, “I can’t possibly be the first to have thought of this. It’s easy. They want to commit suicide anyway, right?”
Right: We are vulnerable, less safe than we thought.
A mouthful of pasta and on he went about how the time has come to blow up the entire Middle East, it’s done for, finished; and how crazy the energy market is right now with the Saudis trying to drive down prices in order to make costly American shale oil production less viable, which in turn should ensure the United States continues to buy Saudi crude even now that it has become the world’s largest oil producer. But of course the Russians are not happy about cheap oil, nor are the Iranians, and the bottom line is it’s chaos out there, sharks devouring one another. Nothing happens by chance, certainly not a 25 per cent drop in oil prices. Somebody would pay for this plot.
Not so long ago, I struggled to remind myself, this guy was brimming over with idealism, throwing in a big investment-banking job to go to the Middle East and invest his energies in democratic change, a free press, a new order, bending my ear about how the time had come for the region and his country in particular to join the modern world. Nothing in the Arab genome condemned the region to backwardness, violence and paranoia. His belief was fervid. It was married to deeds. He walked the walk for change. I was full of admiration.
Then a shadow fell over the world: annexations, beheadings, pestilence, Syria, Gaza and the return of the Middle Eastern strongmen. Hope gave way to fever. When Canada is no longer reassuring, it’s all over. We are vulnerable and we are fearful. That is the new zeitgeist, at least in the West. Fanaticism feeds on frustration; and frustration is widespread because life for many is not getting better. People fret.
Come to think of it, our conversation was not encrypted. How foolish, anybody could be listening in, vacuuming my friend’s dark imaginings into some data-storage depot in the American desert, to be sifted through by a bunch of spooks who could likely hack into his phone or drum up some charge of plotting against the West by having ideas about the propagation of Ebola. Even the healers are being humiliated and quarantined, punished for their generous humanity, while the humanoid big-data geeks get soda, steak and a condo in Nevada.
There were cameras and listening devices everywhere. Just look up, look around. It was a mistake to say anything continued…

To prevent repeat of Gandhi Maidan  Bihar govt gears up with CCTVs and forces at Chhath Puja ghatsChhath Puja is observed from sunset to the next sunrise, six days from Diwali
Written by Santosh Singh | Patna | Posted: October 29, 2014 11:12 am
Rattled by the recent Gandhi Maidan stampede that killed 33 people on Dussehra, the Bihar government has deployed adequate forces and installed 48 CCTVs cameras on Ganga ghats to monitor crowds and control traffic.
In 2012, a stampede had taken place at Adalat Ghat in Patna during Chhath Puja killing 22 people. Two major stampedes in last three years at the state capital have raised serious questions on the state government’s level of preparedness for big crowd management. In Patna alone, over 15 lakh devotees converge on Ganga ghats to mark Chhath Puja.
City SP Satyaveer Singh said: “We have ensured one-way traffic and deployed private volunteers to help devotees.”

A large number of devotees observe the festival near ponds and cemented tanks constructed on rooftop of apartment blocks. This, however, has not lessened rush at Ganga ghats because of people preferring to mark the festival with neighbours near water bodies.
Bihar Chief Minister Jeetan Ram Manjhi, who had received criticism for “inept handling” of Gandhi Maidan crowd during Dussehra, has personally supervised several ghats this time.
The sun temple at Deb in Aurangabad that attracts lakhs of devotees tobserve Chhath Puja has also seen unprecented deployment of forces. Over 150 generators are hired to lit the area for evening and early morning puja offerings. This time the district administration has preferred generators for safety. Rumours that a live wire had fallen was behind the Gandhi Maidan stampede.
All 38 Bihar district magistrates and SPs had been asked to personally monitor security and crowd management at the ghats.
Meanwhile, the state government has declared public holidays for today and tomorrow.

All foreign bank accounts will be assessed by March 2015: AG Mukul Rohatgi on black money casePrint
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 29, 2014 12:47 pm | Updated: October 29, 2014 1:43 pm
With the Centre submitting a list of 627 account holders in foreign banks to Supreme Court in the black money case, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi on Wednesday said that the deadline for investigation under the Income Tax Act into these accounts is March 31, 2015.
He said that the court directed that the sealed envelope with the names be given to the Special Investigation Team (SIT) and also allowed the Centre to put its “problems regarding treaties with foreign nations” before the SIT.
“After that we shall request them to submit the report in the court by November 30,” the AG said.
“There are about 627-628 accounts along with a status report which we have submitted in the Supreme Court today in a sealed cover. Last date for investigation and assessment into all these accounts is March 31, 2015.
“The court after hearing both sides, did not open the cover but directed that the sealed envelope be given to the SIT itself. The SIT will thereafter see what it has to do and proceed in accordance with law,” Rohatgi said.
Speaking to the media immediately after the hearing, the AG also said that this same list had been submitted to the SIT in June earlier this year.
“The apex court has asked SIT to verify the list given by the government and carry on with probe in accordance with law,” he said, adding, “The court has permitted us to place our problems regarding treaties with foreign nations before the SIT”.

Al-Qaeda still offers olive branch to IS: AnalystsPrint
By: Press Trust of India | Washington | Posted: October 29, 2014 3:25 pm | Updated: October 29, 2014 3:31 pm
Al-Qaeda is using US airstrikes in Syria as a reason to extend olive branches to the renegade Islamic State group, saying the two should stop feuding and join forces to attack Western targets a reunification that intelligence analysts say would allow al-Qaeda to capitalise on the younger group’s ruthless advance across the region.
Analysts are closely watching al-Qaeda’s repeated overtures, and while a full reconciliation is not expected soon if ever there is evidence the two groups have curtailed their infighting and are cooperating on the Syrian battlefield, according to activists on the ground, US officials and experts who monitor jihadi messages.
Al-Qaeda is saying, “Let’s just have a truce in Syria,” said Tom Joscelyn, who tracks terror groups for the Long War Journal. “That is what’s underway now. … What we have seen is that local commanders are entering into local truces. There are definitely areas where the two groups are not fighting.”
The Islamic State group has seized about a third of Iraq and Syrian territory and is terrorising civilians to impose a strict interpretation of Islamic law. Their advances led to airstrikes by the United States and a coalition of Western and Gulf nations in both Iraq and Syria.
IS was kicked out of al-Qaeda in May after disobeying its leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri. So far, IS has not publicly responded to al-Qaida’s calls to reunite the most recent on October 17 from al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Yemen-based offshoot that denounced the airstrikes and called on rival militant groups to stop their infighting and together train their sights on the West.
Reconciling with al-Qaeda senior leadership would let IS benefit from al-Qaeda’s broad, international network but would also leave it restrained in carrying out its own attacks. For its part, al-Qaeda would get a boost from the Islamic State group’s newfound popularity in jihadi circles, which has provided an influx of new recruits and money. The US Treasury Department said last week that IS has earned about USD 1
million a day from selling oil on the black market.

Bangladesh tribunal sentences Jamaat-e-Islami chief to death for 1971 war crimesBy: Press Trust of India | Dhaka | Posted: October 29, 2014 4:14 pm
Bangladesh’s fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami chief Matiur Rahman Nizami was on Wednesday sentenced to death by a special tribunal for his role in the killing of thousands of people during the nation’s independence war against Pakistan in 1971, triggering fears of violence.
“He shall be hanged by neck until he is dead,” pronounced Enayetur Rahim, the chairman of the three-member panel of judges of Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal.
The verdict delivered in a packed court room amid tight security said 71-year-old Nizami deserved no punishment other than the death penalty for the gravity of crimes he had committed.
The court said in the unanimous verdict that eight of the 16 charges levelled against the Jamaat leader were proved beyond doubt.
The charges included leading the execution of intellectuals, mass killing, rape and loot during the nine months of bloodshed 43 years ago.
Witnesses said Nizami was present on the dock and looked indifferent as the judges read out the 204-page judgment in turns which took more than an hour to be delivered.
“It would be a failure of justice, unless he is handed down the death penalty,” the verdict said.
The tribunal said Nizami misinterpreted Islam in carrying out the atrocities and as the then president of Islami Chhatra Sangha — the student wing of Jamaat — he turned the organisation into infamous Al-Badr militia forces to carry out mass killings, particularly of the leading intelligentsia.
The panel convicted him of “superior responsibility” as the chief of Al-Badr militia for direct involvement in the killings and tortures in other charges.
Under the law for the war crimes trial, Nizami could challenge the verdict before the apex Supreme Court.
Nizami’s lawyers said they planned to file an appeal before the apex court.
Nizami, a former minister in the BNP-led four party alliance government during its 2001-2006, was the last high-profile accused to be brought to justice on war crimes charges as the two special tribunals set up by the Awami League have so far pronounced verdicts in 10 cases of war crimes.
The charges against Nizami include the murder of 70 people and torching of 72 houses in Pabna’s Bera Upazila, killing 450 people in Demra and Baushia villages and killing many more in front of a Hindu temple in Santhiya Upazila.
The judgment ended a major phase in the war crimes trial during the liberation war.
Immediately after the judgment, Jamaat protested the verdict and issued a statement calling a three-day nationwide general strike to be observed tomorrow, Sunday and Monday.
The government ordered tight security vigil ahead of the verdict deploying paramilitary Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) troops and elite anti-crime Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) to guard the major cities and areas known to be Jamaat strongholds.
“Stern actions will be taken against those who would try to carryout subversive activities or cause law and order situation,” State Minster for Home Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal had said ahead of the verdict.
Meanwhile, hundreds of youngsters under a banner called “Ganojagaron Manch” and the 1971 freedom fighters expressed their satisfaction with the verdict as many of them were seen crying outside continued…

Tripura High Court asks for explanation why FIR was not registered in rural scheme scamPrint
By: Express News Service | Aizawl | Posted: October 29, 2014 6:41 pm
The Tripura High Court on Wednesday issued a notice to the state government and called for an explanation on why an FIR was not registered when the then Finance Minister Badal Chowdhury asked one to be registered in May after a Rs 17 crore rural scheme scam was discovered by an internal audit.
The opposition Congress had this Monday filed a PIL asking for a CBI probe into the Bishalgarh RD Block financial scam. The petition was admitted Wednesday, and the HC issued notices to the state government.
Congress spokesperson Dr Ashok Sinha had attached in his petition a note by then Finance Minister Badal Chowdhury directing that an FIR be registered against erring officials on May 19.
The FIR was never registered, and Chowdhury was shifted from Finance to Health a few days later.
The finance portfolio was handed over to Bhanu Lal Saha, who at the time held the Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs and Information and Culture portfolios and is the MLA from Bishalgarh.
When the audit report leaked and the opposition raised a hue and cry over it, the Bishalgarh BDO Subrata Das filed an FIR against 12 officials, including his predecessor Bimal Chakraborty, who at the time had been promoted to Assistant Director of the Information and Culture department.
Chakraborty has since been arrested and named as the prime accused in the scam.
Meanwhile, Audit Department director Lalmuana Rokhum, an IAS officer under whom the audits were carried out, was shifted to the State Institute of Public Administration and Rural Development or SIPARD as Officer on Special Duty.
The Congress then went to the HC with a petition demanding a CBI probe into the matter saying alleging the state police would not be able to conduct an impartial probe.
The next date of hearing has been fixed for November 24.
 

Report on black money will be submitted on time: Justice M B ShahPrint

Investigation against over 600 people accused of stashing money abroad illegally is going on and a report on it will be submitted on time, Chief of Special Investigation Team (SIT) on black money Justice M B Shah said on Wednesday.

“We have already filed the first report (on black money) in August. Certainly I am hopeful about it (timely submission of second report),” he said.
On a day the Attorney General submitted a list of 627 names having accounts in HSBC bank, Geneva, to the apex court, Shah told CNN-IBN that the list was already known to the team.
“Investigation is going on. Without investigation, it is very difficult to say that a person is guilty or that person has done something wrong. A person is required to be heard first,” he said.
Shah, a retired Supreme Court judge, said investigation in these cases is not easy. “It is not easy because when a department also issues a notice, it takes time. Concerned parties and assessees replies take time,” the SIT chief said.
Shah denied that government’s probe in black money case is an eyewash. “It is not eyewash. Nothing is eyewash. Nothing can be said to be eye wash. On the contrary we got some results also,” he said.

Spooked by economic impact  Kerala to go slow on flex board banChandy had kicked off the campaign against flex boards by tearing away a board with his image
Written by Shaju Philip | Thiruvananthapuram | Posted: October 29, 2014 8:08 pm
Looking at huge loss of jobs and multi-crore investments going waste, the Kerala government on Wednesday said it would enforce the ban on flex boards in a phased manner.
Earlier this month, Chief Minister Oommen Chandy had declared a complete ban on flex boards in a single sweep among steps to contain the plastic menace.  Chandy had kicked off the campaign against flex boards by tearing away a board with his image.
A month into the drive, the government was seized off the practical difficulties in ushering a flex board-free world in one go. The entrepreneurs in flex manufacturing and hoarding industry had raised concerns about the knee-jerk decision of the government which synched with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Swacch Bharat Mission. But it was after the ban that the government appointed a cabinet sub-committee to study whether there should be a total ban or not.
On Wednesday, Chandy said his government would consider the concern of investors and employees in the sector. Hence, the flex ban would be introduced in a phased manner. “There should be strict restrictions about installing flex boards in public places. The local bodies should remove all illegally erected boards. The government departments would not go for flex boards in promoting events,” said Chandy.
The All Kerala Sign Printers’ Association said the state has 1,800 units engaged in flex printing. “Even a small unit would require investment of Rs 30 lakh in machinery alone.  There are units which have equipment worth Rs 1.50 crore.  From 10 to 40 persons are employed in units depending upon the size,” said C Sreeni, the association spokesperson in Kochi .
He said a major chunk of the employees and investors are youngsters since the industry has boomed only in the recent years. “We are against defacing public places. But the flex boards should not be viewed from that point alone as the sector is an integral part of outdoor publicity.”
He said investors are worried about the unexpected decision, which would make hundreds of youths jobless and risk investment.
Flex boards have virtually defaced public places in Kerala. It has been a fashion for political leaders and organisations to raise flex boards; most of them appreciating themselves for some decisions or local projects.
Even a small unit would require investment of Rs 30 lakh in machinery alone.

Maine cant hold Ebola nurse without judgesorderOfficials say until a judge signs off on an order they don't have authority to prevent a nurse from leaving home.
By: Associated Press | Fort Kent | Posted: October 30, 2014 4:57 am
Health officials in the far northeastern state of Maine say until a judge signs off on a court order they don’t have the authority to prevent a nurse who treated Ebola patients in West Africa from leaving her home.
Maine Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Mary Mayhew says state police will monitor nurse Kaci Hickox’s movements if she leaves her house. But Hickox can’t be detained without a judge’s approval.
Hickox has shown no symptoms of Ebola. She has been abiding by the state’s voluntary quarantine but says she’ll stop doing so Thursday. That sets up a showdown with the state, which wants her quarantined for 21 days.
Hickox was the first person forced into New Jersey’s mandatory quarantine after arriving at an airport there. She’s now in Fort Kent, near the Canadian border.
Mayhew says Maine’s request for the court order could be filed by Wednesday night.

TCS only Indian firm in top 50 most innovat...Airbus
(Apple topped the chart,…)
NEW DELHI: Country's largest software services exporter Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) was the only Indian company found place in the Boston Consulting Group's global list of top 50 most innovative firms this year.
Technology giant Apple topped the chart, followed by Google , Samsung , Microsoft and IBM as the most innovative companies globally in the list of the global management consulting firm. TCS secured the 43rd position in the list.
Apart from telecom and technology firms, car makers Tesla Motors , Toyota and BMW as well as firms like Nike , Shell, Airbus and McDonald's also featured among the top 50.
BCG has surveyed more than 1,500 senior executives in a wide range of countries and industries since 2004 to help cast light on the state of innovation in global business.
The report examined the factors that separate breakthrough innovators from other companies.
It found that breakthrough innovators are strong innovators first -- they excel at the fundamentals that define successful innovation programmes.
They also cast a wider net for ideas, use business model innovation more and they have cultures geared toward breakthrough success, it added.
Almost half of breakthrough innovators reported generating more than 30 per cent of sales from innovations over the past three years, more than twice the average for all companies, it said.
BCG asked respondents to name up-and-coming companies that are still relatively young or have yet to reach the scale of the top 50 global giants but are making themselves known for innovation. Companies like WhatsApp, Square, Rakuten and Wipro lead this list.
"Innovation isn't getting any easier. Too many companies want to shoot for the moon while their innovation programmes are barely airborne. It is no longer enough to be good at incremental innovation," BCG Senior Partner and Director Neeraj Aggarwal said.
Breakthrough innovators are especially effective at bringing together the pieces required for radical innovation such as management, governance and organisational design that can have a major impact on any company's innovation programme, he added.
The survey found only 13 per cent respondents saying they have a significant ambition to deliver radical innovation.

Al Qaeda leaflets talk of Bengal caliphateAl Qaeda leaflets talk of Bengal caliphate
Snigdhendu Bhattacharya , Hindustan Times  Kolkata, October 29, 2014
First Published: 20:25 IST(29/10/2014) | Last Updated: 09:11 IST(30/10/2014)
Comments
Intelligence officials in West Bengal have found a purported al Qaeda pamphlet, which talks about establishing an ISIS-style Islamic caliphate in Bangladesh – one that eventually includes several eastern and northeastern Indian states.
The pamphlet, written in Bangla and being secretly distributed in West Bengal and Assam, says establishing a caliphate in Bangladesh is crucial for intensifying jihad in Indian states on the eastern border. The text, credited to al-Qaeda’s media wing, specifically mentions West Bengal and Assam, though intelligence officials suspect Bihar and Jharkhand also feature in the terror group’s plans.
“If we manage to establish a Syria-like reign here (in Bangladesh) then Muslims from Assam, Arakan (former name of Burma’s Rakhine State) and West Bengal too would be able to come here for hijrat (migration with religious agenda). Simultaneously, anti-India revolts would intensify in seven eastern Indian states,” says the pamphlet. “This would be a huge blow for India, one of the key non-Muslim states in the changed situation of the world.”
The discovery of the jihadi literature comes after al Qaeda announced its plans in September to open a branch in the Indian subcontinent. The pamphlet, urging people to restore the Islamic rule of pre-colonial India, may raise new security challenges amid growing communal polarisation in West Bengal, analysts said.
“We have got a copy of the leaflet. We will soon send it to New Delhi. This issue has to be discussed at the top level,” a senior officer working with a central intelligence agency told HT on Wednesday.
The pamphlet, suspected to have been smuggled into the state through Bangladesh, was discovered a few days before the October 2 Burdwan blast in which two operatives of the militant outfit, Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), were killed while making bombs in a house.
HT has a copy of the seven-page pamphlet but could not verify if it is an al Qaeda document.
“They have active modules in Jharkhand and Bihar. We have specific inputs that many of those operating in West Bengal had also visited Jharkhand,” an intelligence officer told HT.
Analysts say al Qaeda’s efforts are the latest signs of the organisation striving to stay relevant in the face of growing support for ISIS in Iraq and Syria.
West Bengal home secretary Basudeb Banerjee refused to speak to HT, while additional director general of law and order Shibaji Ghosh and additional director general of intelligence Banibrata Basu did not respond to text messages.
The pamphlet comes close on the heels of the launch of al Qaeda’s English mouthpiece, Resurgence, which deals with its plans for India and Bangladesh. While an article on India urged Muslims here to “regain lost glory of ruling India”, another on Bangladesh stressed that the country was becoming an outpost of India “politically, economically and culturally”.

Govt relaxes norms for FDI in construction | Decks cleared for India s longest expresswayGovernment relaxes FDI norms for construction, real estate sector

(The move will facilitate…)
NEW DELHI: The government eased overseas investment rules in construction to attract money into the funds-starved sector and serve its twin objectives of faster job creation and housing for all. The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved a comprehensive proposal by the Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion (DIPP), dropping the minimum 10-hectare rule for serviced housing plots and slashing the minimum floor area for construction development projects to 20,000 sq m from 50,000 sq m to be eligible for overseas investment.
It also halved the minimum foreign direct investment (FDI) amount to $5 million from $10 million and substantially eased the exit norms, raising an across-the board cheer from an industry that now hopes for bigger foreign fund flows into a sector that desperately needs money.
"The government is bang on (target). We are very glad about the trunk infrastructure completion part as it will bring in asset-based FDI. This will ensure that project developers who have taken FDI are not left with more debt," said Rajeev Talwar, executive director of DLF, India's biggest listed developer. Trunk infrastructure refers to essential amenities such as roads, water supply, street lighting, drainage and sewerage.
The new rules will also give a boost to the 100 smart cities being planned by the government. Home buyers will also cheer the relaxation as fresh inflows raise the possibility of projects that are stuck getting completed and cheaper housing becoming available going ahead. Most housing projects are running one to two years or even more behind schedule because of the slowdown and the shortage of funds on account of elevated debt levels.
"It is an excellent move by the government and will definitely help the developers which are running late with their projects due to the funds crunch. Townships take a minimum of 10 years to be completed, so the relaxation will ensure that funds are not a problem," said RR Singh, director-general of National Real Estate Development Council, or Naredco. The norms will come into force after DIPP issues a notification. The government has promised housing for all by 2022 and toward that end provided an incentive for affordable housing in the revamped policy.
The sectoral condition of minimum area and capital will not apply if the developer sets aside 30% of the project for affordable housing, defined as dwelling units of less than 60 sq m. Singh said finding 10 hectares of land in tier-I and tier-II cities was difficult, so scrapping this rule will encourage investors to bring in money. In its July budget, the new government had said it would relax foreign investment rules for the sector. The government is also looking to boost construction of hotels, tourist resorts, hospitals, special economic zones (SEZs), educational institutions, old-age homes and invest ments by non-resident Indians (NRIs), giving free access in these segments.
"These measures are expected to result in enhanced inflows into the construction development sector consequent to easing of sectoral conditions and clarification of terms used in the policy," the government said in a statement. The sector attracted $1.2 billion in FDI in 2013-14, down 8% from 2012-13. The most significant incentive to foreign investment is the easier exit compared with the existing rule of a three-year lock-in after the completion of minimum capitalisation of $10 million. Under the new rules, investors will have to bring $5 million within six months of commencement of projects and the balance over 10 years or before the completion of project, whichever is earlier.
The investor can exit on completion of the project or three years after the final investment, subject to the development of trunk infrastructure. FDI can be repatriated or transferred before the completion of the project if approved by the Foreign Investment Promotion Board. "Lingering issues with respect to lock-in requirement and exit route along with the prohibitive minimum threshold for built-up area have had a dampening effect on FDI in the sector," said Sachin Sandhir, global managing director, emerging business, and MD, South Asia, RICS.
"A positive announcement towards this end is indeed welcome and will encourage more investors to consider investing in India, if they are able to exit from the projects sooner." The construction sector, which has a significant ripple effect on the economy, grew only 1.6% in FY14, contributing to the sub-5% growth in the year.
 
"Investment in the construction development sector has a multiplier effect on the economy by way of infrastructure creation; substantial employment generation over the entire spectrum from unskilled workers to engineers, architects, designers as well as financial and other supporting services," the government said. Talwar of DLF expects the measures to lead to a revival in the sector and the wider economy.

Mudslide
(A mudslide triggered by…)
KOSLANDA: A mudslide triggered by monsoon rains buried scores of workers' houses at a tea plantation in central Sri Lanka on Wednesday, raising fears that hundreds may have been killed.
In the chaos that followed, there was confusion about the number of dead and missing because government officials reported different figures and later reduced the number of missing by 100 without explanation.
The mudslide struck at about 7:30 a.m. and wiped out 120 workers' homes at the Koslanda tea plantation, said Lal Sarath Kumara, an official from the Disaster Management Center. The plantation is in the town of Koslanda in Badulla district about 140 miles (220 kilometers) east of Colombo.
He said at least 10 people were killed and more than 250 reported missing.
Later Disaster Management Minister Mahinda Amaraweera was quoted by media as saying that more than 100 people had been killed. Moments later he told The Associated Press that less than 100 people were missing but they could not be counted as dead.
By late Wednesday the Disaster Management Center's official numbers were six dead and 150 missing. Pradeep Kodipppily, a senior official at the center did not explain the changes but said the agency would be able to give the media a clearer picture by Thursday morning.
The scene of the mudslide and witness accounts however suggested the disaster was enormous.
The military mobilized troops to help with the rescue operation as rain continued to fall in the island nation's central hills. Mud covered many homes without a trace while roofs of some were visible. Water gushing down hillsides indicated more slides were possible.
P. Arumugam, who works as a driver on the plantation, said he rushed there when he heard about the mudslide.
``Everything that I saw yesterday I could not see today _ buildings, the temple and shops had all disappeared. I could only see mud everywhere,'' he said.
Marimuttu Navaneethan, a 28-year-old shopkeeper, said he heard a big noise and saw mud rolling down toward his home.
He and his family ran from the house, which was soon mostly covered by the mudslide. He said 65 other nearby houses were completely covered.
``A midwife was living in one house with six family members, and now all are missing except her husband. Their house was pushed down 200 meters and stopped near our home and their mango tree is now on our roof,'' he said.
State broadcaster Rupavahini showed huge mounds of earth covering the houses and muddy water still gushing from the hilltops.
Scores of children who had left for school early morning returned only to see their homes vanished without a trace along with their parents.
About 500 military personnel and civilians searched for survivors with the help of heavy earthmoving equipment. The search was later called off for the night because of rain and muddy conditions, military spokesman Brigadier Jayanath Jayawerera said.
  Most of Sri Lanka has experienced heavy rain over the past few weeks, and the Disaster Management Center had issued warnings of mudslides and falling rocks. A local government official said that the area had been marked vulnerable since 2008 and even evacuation drills had been conducted. However, the workers had not been given alternative homes to move into, the official said on condition of anonymity because government rules prohibit him from speaking to media.
He said the absence of a proper rain water draining system on the hill may have loosened the soil over time.
The monsoon season in the Indian Ocean island nation runs from October through December.
Sri Lanka, formerly called Ceylon, is one of the world's leading producers of tea. Most Ceylon tea, as it is known, is produced in the central hills, where the high altitudes and rainfall provide favorable conditions.

CAPE CANAVERAL: An unmanned Atlas rocket blasted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on Wednesday to deliver a Global Positioning System navigation satellite into orbit for the US Air Force.
The 189-foot-tall (58-meter) rocket, built and launched by a partnership of Lockheed Martin and Boeing, lifted off at 1:21 p.m. (1721 GMT).
Perched on top of the rocket was a $245 million Boeing-built GPS satellite , the eighth in the military's new Block 2F series.
Once in position 12,660 miles (20,374 km) above the planet, the spacecraft will replace an aging satellite in the 31-member operational network.
The launch from Florida occurred 17 hours after an unmanned Orbital Sciences Antares rocket exploded seconds after liftoff from a launch pad on Wallops Island, Virginia, destroying a cargo ship bound for the International Space Station.
"The 45th Space Wing and the launch team evaluated the Atlas 5 launch vehicle for common components with the failed Antares launch vehicle (and) have determined that these common components do not introduce any additional risk to the success of the Atlas 5 GPS mission," the Air Force said in a statement before launch.
Orbital Sciences and the Federal Aviation Administration, which oversees commercial space flights in the United States, are investigating the accident, with assistance from NASA, which owns the Wallops Flight Facility and which has a $1.9 billion contract with Orbital Sciences to fly cargo to the space station, a $100 billion project of 15 nations.
The new 2F GPS satellites, which are designed to last 12 years, feature greater accuracy, stronger anti-jamming protection and a commercial aviation search-and-rescue signal. Three more satellites in the series are slated to launch next year, with the 12th and final member targeted to fly in 2016.
Wednesday's launch was the 50th Atlas 5 flight and 89th mission overall for the United Launch Alliance partnership.

LONDON: British Prime Minister David Cameron on Wednesday urged Qatar to plough more of its vast oil and gas wealth into infrastructure projects across Britain during an official visit from the Gulf state's emir.
Cameron asked Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani to consider further funding to help Britain's push to develop cities in the north of the country and connect them to London using a high speed rail line, a statement released by his office said.
Qatar is one of the world's richest countries and is already heavily invested in British firms and property.
Among its highest profile investments are London's tallest building, the Shard, which was funded by the Qatari royal family, and the upmarket Harrods department store owned by sovereign wealth fund Qatar Investment Authority.
"The Prime Minister ... encouraged the Emir to consider more opportunities across the country, particularly the government's plan to establish a Northern Powerhouse by connecting our great Northern cities and the development of high speed rail," the statement said.
Earlier this week the British government said it was backing the development of a fast rail link between the English cities of Leeds and Manchester, in addition to an existing 43 billion pound(68.88 billion US dollar) plan to develop high speed links to London.
During the state visit, which also included a meeting with Queen Elizabeth as well as senior politicians and executives, the two countries signed an agreement setting out a framework for further talks on issues such as defence, energy and trade.
Prior to Sheikh Tamim's visit, British lawmakers had called for Cameron to question him on accusations - denied by Qatar - that it had financed Islamic State (IS) militants in Iraq and Syria.
"They discussed the role both countries are playing in the coalition to tackle ISIL (IS), and the importance of all countries working to tackle extremism and support to terrorist organisations," the statement said, adding that Cameron had welcomed recent legislation in Qatar to block terrorist funding.
A German cabinet minister accused Qatar in August of financing Islamic State militants and the United States has expressed concern about funding by individuals or charities in Arab states, although Qatar has since joined in US-led air strikes against Islamic State targets in Syria.
In September, Sheikh Tamim said his country was not aiding Islamic State in Iraq or Syria, telling German Chancellor Angela Merkel that his own country's security was jeopardised by the militants.

Why McDonalds may turn up on activists menusWhy McDonald’s may turn up on activists’ menus
New York Times Oct 30, 2014, 02.35AM IST

By ?Tara Lachapelle
As the world's largest restaurant chain loses customers to rivals such as Wendy's and Chipotle Mexican Grill, it's beginning to look vulnerable. McDonald's valuation relative to earnings is now lower than any of its American peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That, coupled with the burger chain's cash and low debt, are key ingredients for an activist campaign that could force more share buybacks or changes in strategy. The days of McDonald's $90-billion market value being a shield against activist investors are over.
Heavyweights like Carl Icahn and Nelson Peltz have been going after some of the largest US companies. Peltz is looking to split apart PepsiCo while Icahn continues to put pressure on the biggest of them all: Apple.
He wants the $617-billion iPhone maker to be more productive with its cash. Should McDonald's continue to stumble and its shareholder base become more frustrated, the likelihood of activist involvement will increase, said Morningstar.
"There's been a lot of speculation within the analyst community and investor community about whether McDonald's would be an activist target," Will Slabaugh, an Arkansas- based analyst at Stephens, said in a phone interview. "People are kind of giving management another shot to turn this around before coming after them. The recent earnings results definitely leave them more vulnerable now."
More aggressive
Slabaugh said he'd like McDonald's to "get a little bit more aggressive" with its balance sheet. It has room to take on more debt to repurchase stock, according to Mark Kalinowski, a New York-based analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott. An activist could also suggest the company convert more of its stores into franchised locations, where the franchisee pays for rising beef and labour costs, he said.
McDonald's has returned $4.6 billion to shareholders so far this year through September as part of its goal to return as much as $20 billion by 2016, "which is a testament to our ongoing commitment to build long-term shareholder value," Becca Hary, a spokeswoman for the Illinois-based company, said.
 
Stock drop
McDonald's profit fell 30% in the three months ended September 30. US same-store sales slumped for a fourth straight quarter and the decline was worse than analysts were expecting. The stock has fallen 5.2% this year, as the Bloomberg Intelligence index of North American quick-service restaurants climbed 19%.
If McDonald's shares end the year at a loss, it will be only the second time in the past decade and the sixth annual decrease since 1980, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Even though its scale still dwarfs every rival, competition is intensifying. Burger King Worldwide and Wendy's, each backed by a large investment firm, are offering deals and introducing new items. McDonald's price-earnings ratio of 17 compares with the 40 times earnings Burger King's stock fetches and 36 for Wendy's, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Burger King is controlled by 3G Capital, known for slashing costs and boosting profits. The $11-billion fast-food company is in the process of buying Canada's Tim Hortons and moving its headquarters outside the US in a tax-inversion deal.
Diners are also increasingly opting for "fast-casual" restaurants such as Chipotle. The burrito maker spun off from McDonald's in 2006 will be America's fastest-growing restaurant chain larger than $1 billion over the next three years, with a 72% boost to revenue. McDonald's sales may climb 2% over that span, the data show. McDonald's ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation is 1.5, lower than most of its peers.
Members of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, the benchmark of American equity, have a median leverage ratio of 2. An activist with expertise in the restaurant industry could even help improve operations or push for a transaction that unlocks the value of McDonald's real estate, Morningstar's Hottovy said. It's also conceivable that at some point McDonald's could be pressured to diversify through acquisitions that help boost the company's growth, he said.
Restaurant activism
Activism has already cropped up in the restaurant industry this year. Starboard Value waged a proxy fight with Olive Garden owner Darden Restaurants over the direction of the $6.8-billion company. The activist investor this month persuaded investors to replace Darden's entire board, and its chief executive officer subsequently stepped down.
In the case of McDonald's, its large market value may be a hurdle, said Janney's Kalinowski. Even a 2% stake would cost nearly $2 billion. Still, activist investors have been getting ambitious. As they amass more cash, many have pivoted toward buying smaller stakes in larger targets, instead of the more traditional 5%-plus stakes in smaller companies.
In addition to Icahn's Apple campaign, recent examples include ValueAct Capital Management's less than 1% stake in Microsoft, Elliott Management's $1-billion piece of EMC and Jana Partners's shares in Apache. "Certainly McDonald's is stumbling in terms of its sales trends," Kalinowski said. "Maybe if you had an activist with some insights on how to fix the core business, that wouldn't be such a bad thing."

US stocks: Wall St ends with modest decline after Fed ends QEUS stocks closed with slight losses on Wednesday, finishing off their lows of the session, after the Fed ended its monthly bond-buying program.

NEW YORK: US stocks closed with slight losses on Wednesday, finishing off their lows of the session, after the Federal Reserve ended its stimulative monthly bond-buying program and expressed confidence in US economic prospects.
Major indexes were volatile following the central bank's statement, with the S&P 500 down as much as 0.8 per cent before pulling back. Material shares were lower throughout the session, a decline in Facebook pressured the Nasdaq, but strength in energy and financial shares helped the market recover.
In a statement after a two-day meeting, the Fed ended its quantitative easing program of bond purchases, as had been expected. At its peak, the program pumped $85 billion a month into the financial system. The Fed also dropped a characterization of US labor market slack as "significant" in a show of confidence in the economy's prospects.
"The Fed had a little more of a hawkish bent than the market expected, but any weakness that came from the statement was obviously viewed as a buying opportunity," said Alan Gayle, director of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments in Atlanta, Georgia.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 31.44 points, or 0.18 per cent, to 16,974.31, the S&P 500 lost 2.75 points, or 0.14 per cent, to 1,982.3 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 15.07 points, or 0.33 per cent, to 4,549.23.
Material shares fell 1.3 per cent after DuPont said there were "competitive advantages" to keeping its businesses together. Activist investor Nelson Peltz has urged DuPont to separate its various businesses in a move that has supported the company's shares. Shares of DuPont lost 1.7 per cent to $66.80.
Facebook Inc fell 6.1 per cent to $75.86 the day after the social network announced an increase in spending in 2015 and projected a slowdown in revenue growth this quarter.
After the market closed, shares of Visa Inc rose 3.6 per cent to $222.40. Visa reported its fourth-quarter results and announcing a stock buyback program of $5 billion.
Despite the turn lower, equities mostly held onto recent gains, with the S&P 500 up 6.4 per cent over the last nine sessions as earnings have mostly been strong. So far this reporting season, 75.3 per cent of S&P 500 companies have exceeded profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, above the long-term average of 63 per cent.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,763 to 1,322, for a 1.33-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 1,437 issues fell and 1,245 advanced for a 1.15-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.
The benchmark S&P 500 index posted 65 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 114 new highs and 35 new lows.
About 7.08 billion shares traded on all US platforms, according to BATS exchange data, below the month-to-date average of 7.86 billion.

India s delivery men offer prize as billions pour into e-commerceFrom Japan's richest man Masayoshi Son to Amazon.com's Jeff Bezos, everyone wants a piece of India's booming online retail sector.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
MUMBAI/BANGALORE: From Japan's richest man to Jeff Bezos , everyone wants a piece of India's booming online retail sector. For those without billions to pump into the tightly held firms who dominate e-commerce, the best bet may be the delivery men.
On Tuesday, SoftBank Corp Chief Executive Masayoshi Son joined Bezos's Amazon.com Inc in pledging heavy investment in an e-commerce industry worth $10 billion and seen quadrupling in five years. Son's gambit: a stake in Snapdeal, India's third-biggest online marketplace.
Yet the little-known firms that deliver goods ordered online are already raking in rocketing earnings from e-commerce in a country with the world's third-biggest Internet user base, and they're listed. Shares in companies like Transport Corp of India and Gati Ltd have surged more than three-quarters this year as industry watchers seek a chance to invest.
"When you see the limitless growth in the e-commerce sector, you do want to get involved," said Eric Mookherjee, a Paris-based fund manager at Shanti India, whose holdings include Transport Corp. "The next Alibaba or Tencent can be created in a country whose population is roughly similar to China. You will get that in India."
Finance house Nomura estimated in a research note in July that India's e-commerce industry could more than quadruple to $43 billion over the next five years, driven by online retail.
Pledging to invest $10 billion in India in the next 10 years, SoftBank's Son on Tuesday said Snapdeal has the potential to become India's Alibaba, the recently listed Chinese e-commerce giant. Son is well placed to know: his fast-growing Japanese telecom and media empire is the biggest Alibaba investor.
DELIVERY OUTSOURCING A MUST
Son's move comes after India's two biggest online retailers, the home-grown startup Flipkart.com, and Amazon's India business, began spending billions of dollars to secure a bigger share of the market. Though India's Internet population is huge, e-commerce infrastructure remains relatively under-developed and ripe for huge growth.
The forecasts for future expansion, and a key role in it for third-party delivery firms, have helped push the more than $50 billion Indian logistics sector, including Gati and Transport Corp, about 80 per cent higher so far this year. That makes it the fifth-best performing major industry in India by the Thomson Reuters StarMine classification.
Earnings are also ramping up. Net income of Blue Dart Express and Transport Corp is expected to jump by 37 per cent and 24 per cent in this fiscal year respectively, according to Thomson Reuters' SmartEstimates, which place an emphasis on recent forecasts by top-rated analysts.
In comparison, net profit of companies in the Bombay Stock Exchange's main 30-share index is expected to rise just 15 per cent on average.
As the market surges, competition for customers among e-commerce firms will see them seek to cut delivery times and expand into smaller cities. While Amazon and Snapdeal use both in-house logistics networks and external service providers, new services will see them relying increasingly on outsourcing.

Richard Branson on Narendra Modi: Now  India has a leader who leads by exampleIndia
(If we can get the British…)
Calling Richard Branson busy would be stating the obvious. But for the owner of a conglomerate that controls an airline group, a telecommunications company, a seller of holidays and one which is planning to operate commercial space flights, he looks surprisingly laid-back. Branson has just returned from Mexico City — where he was discussing 'drug mafia wars' with the mayor — to celebrate Virgin Atlantic's maiden flight with its brand new Boeing Dreamliner 787-900 to Atlanta. He cracks jokes about his businesses, his colleagues and his rivals at British Airways. He says his friend Tony Fernandes wants him as a stewardess in AirAsia India and that he is "considering the offer".
Branson had actually dressed up as a stewardess in an AirAsia X flight in 2012 after losing a bet on the results of Formula One racing. Branson is perhaps one of the prime examples of tycoons who are brand ambassadors of their own businesses, an image Vijay Mallya of Kingfisher Airlines tried to replicate. Branson's Virgin Group hasn't expanded in India as much as many would have expected it to. His airline will stop flying to Mumbai in December, one of the two flights it currently operates to the country, as it isn't making money. This is a far cry from his plans to invest $300 million in the country, which he announced after a song and dance affair and a ride atop elephants in Mumbai in 2012.
The airline's plans changed last year after it shifted focus to transatlantic routes, especially as a result of its partnership with Atlanta's Air Delta, forged in 2012. Branson's Virgin Mobile, which has an equal partnership with Tata Teleservices for its India operations, also hasn't grown from being a fringe player in the market. In an interview with ET's Anirban Chowdhury, Branson speaks about his optimism about the Indian market, his views on the Jet-Etihad combine and his sympathy for Mallya. Edited excerpts.
Do you think the change in government makes for a better business environment in India?
The impression from there is very positive. India was doing so well and then it languished for 3-4 years. Now it does seem that it will get back on track to doing really well. It is great to have someone in charge who has business experience. I am biased, but I think that helps. I think it's fantastic to have a leader who's trying to stamp out corruption. I think corruption rots society, especially if it starts from the top and goes all the way down. Now, you have a leader who leads by example. So (I am) very hopeful that India will welcome competition which is good for the consumer.
Does it encourage you to bring more of your businesses to India?
Certainly, it encourages me to do so. We will certainly be looking at India again and thinking what else we can do there. I am sure we will be trading a lot more with India in the future. We are putting a brand new $124 million plane (Boeing Dreamliner) in Delhi. So that's a good start.
Your 'look West' policy, so to speak, has you taking capacity out of the east. Don't you think it will be too late to expand there when you finally look at it again, especially with the growing dominance of Gulf carriers?
If we can get the British government to be brave and build extra runways at Heathrow, we will definitely do a lot more expansion in the east. For every slot that we need for a profitable route, we have to give up another route —that's really sad. I would much rather have stuck with Mumbai longer, especially at a time when India came out of its recession. But we had to move that slot somewhere else, and so we moved it somewhere else. But we will be back in Mumbai some day.
 
Overall, do you think the might and aggression of the Gulf carriers are a threat to western carriers?
I think Virgin Atlantic has got a very, very loyal following. We have about 50 planes to a Gulf carrier's 500 planes. On the specific routes that we fly, we still get our fair share of customers. People like our product. What the Gulf carriers have done is incredible. But we want competition and we will fly alongside them on certain routes.
One of your partners Etihad Airways (Virgin Australia) has picked up 24% stake in India's loss-making carrier Jet Airways. Do you think it will be able to turn Jet around, going by what it's done for your airline yet?
I don't know enough about the details of the deal. Etihad has very deep pockets, but at the end of the day, it's answerable to its shareholders. Jet is a good airline. So, my instinct is that they may well pull it off. There is a very aggressive new lowcost carrier in India. I have known them for a few years. They took care of Virgin Atlantic when we first came there. And they are going to give people a run for their money. So, Jet's got formidable competition, but we will see what happens.
Do you mean AirAsia or IndiGo?
I mean IndiGo.
Vijay Mallya is often compared to you. He isn't going through the best phases of his business. His airline is grounded and his liquor businesses are in heavy debt. Any words for him?
It's obviously sad to see people stumbling. I am sure he (Mallya) will learn from his mistakes and pick himself up and tries all over again. I wish him and anybody who stumbles, well.
No comment on the comparisons?
Well, he's got a beard... (laughs)

NEW YORK/SEATTLE: Billionaire investors in a small, Seattle-area company that aims to one day mine resources on asteroids have not been deterred by an unmanned rocket explosion that destroyed their test satellite, the company said on Wednesday.
Privately held Planetary Resources counts Google Inc Chief Executive and co-founder Larry Page and Chairman Eric Schmidt among its backers, along with Virgin Group founder Richard Branson, Ross Perot Jr., former Microsoft Corp executive Charles Simonyi and John Whitehead, the former chief executive of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
"Everyone knows what we are doing is audacious; if we didn't have some failures now and then it would be stunning," said Chris Lewicki, president and chief engineer at Planetary Resources.
"Fortunately we have got some very supportive and visionary investors," he said. "They know we're in this for the long run and we've already moved on to the next thing."
The Redmond, Washington-based company makes a profit from technology contracts with NASA and other private customers, involving propulsion and instruments, Lewicki said.
It plans to eventually extract water, fuel and minerals from asteroids near Earth. But as an interim step, it is developing small satellites with miniature sensors that can communicate with Earth to test its technology.
Rather than using dedicated launch vehicles that can cost millions per launch, Planetary Resources satellites are small enough "to hitch a ride into space with larger, primary payloads," the company said.
That's how the Arkyd 3, a 12-inch by 4-inch unit weighing 10 pounds, came to be aboard the Antares rocket that exploded on Tuesday.
The rocket was built and launched by Orbital Sciences Corp and was mainly intended to carry a Cygnus cargo ship with supplies for the International Space Station.
Lewicki said Arkyd 3 was insured, but he declined to give details.
In any case, the setback will not affect the development of its next satellite, known as the Arkyd 6, which has been in development for several months and will be about twice as large as Arkyd 3, he said.
The company achieved "most of our objectives" with Arkyd 3, the company said.
Arkyd 6 is scheduled for launch in the third quarter of next year, and Planetary Resources will use Spaceflight Services Inc of Tukwila, Washington, to configure the ride on a commercial launch vehicle in the United States.
A6 is an "engineering demonstrator" that will orbit earth and is designed to test software, computing systems and the satellite's ability to know where it is pointed and to maneuver, Lewicki said.
Eventually, he added, the company plans to create the Arkyd 300 Series Rendezvous Prospector, which will actually orbit target asteroids.

Best Foods plans Rs.75 cr investment

investments
Best Foods, one of the largest domestic rice companies, is aiming to double its turnover at Rs.5,000 crore in the next three years on rising demand for grains in the domestic and overseas markets.
“We are targeting 30 per cent growth this fiscal, and want to double our turnover to about Rs.5,000 crore by 2016-17,” company CEO Aayushman Gupta told reporters here on Wednesday.
The company’s turnover in the last fiscal stood at Rs.2,600 crore.
Best Food has plans to invest Rs.75 crore over the next three years to increase the number of its retail outlets to at least 500 from 35 stores now. The firm has 17 rice mills with an installed capacity to process 45,000 tonnes of rice a month. The company markets products under brand name 'Best'.
Mr. Gupta said the growth would come on the back of rising population, growing demand for rice, penetration into new market and increased share in the existing market.
Meanwhile, the company announced that it has received accreditation from the Indian Culinary Forum (ICF), which has 600 registered members.
ICF President Chef Devender Kumar said, “We have given accreditation to Best Food’s rice and rice products. Best Food is the first rice company to get our accreditation. We will endorse the quality and the brand.”

The Hindu The market price for cotton ranged between Rs.32,000 and Rs.34,000 a candy, while the MSP was at least Rs.37,500, the official said.
TOPICS
agriculture
The Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) has started procuring cotton at the Minimum Support Price (MSP) in Andhra Pradesh and Telengana as the market price for cotton in these States is less than the MSP.
An official of the CCI told The Hindu that it had procured 15,000 bales in the last one week. The market rate for long staple cotton in these markets was quoted at Rs.3,800-3,900 a quintal as against the MSP of Rs.4,050 a quintal.
The market price for cotton ranged between Rs.32,000 and Rs.34,000 a candy, while the MSP was at least Rs.37,500, the official said.
Nearly 40,000 bales of cotton are coming into the market every day, and it will go up to over one lakh bales in December and January. The Cotton Advisory Board has estimated domestic cotton production at 400 lakh bales this year (October, 2014 to September, 2015).
Though the market prices might not fall further, the CCI might have to buy one crore bales of cotton this year at the MSP, the official said. In 2008-09, it had procured about 90 lakh bales. Last year, it purchased just 40,000 bales at the MSP.
The CCI had equipped its 330 centres for MSP operations, and these were spread across the cotton growing centres in the country. With CCI commencing purchases in the market, the prices had stabilised to some extent, the official added.

30 lakh cans of Aravana to be kept as buffer stockUpdated: October 30, 2014 02:27 IST
30 lakh cans of Aravana to be kept as buffer stock
Radhakrishnan Kuttoor
The Hindu Aravana production in progress at the mechanised plant at the Sabarimala Sannidhanam.
‘Sufficient materials stocked at Sabarimala’
Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) has started production of Aravana payasom, the most sought-after ‘prasadom’ of the presiding deity, at its mechanised plant at Sabarimala Sannidhanam on Monday.
V.S. Jayakumar, Executive Officer at Sabarimala, told The Hindu that the TDB would keep a buffer stock of 30 lakh cans (250ml each) of Aravana by the time the Ayyappa temple opened for the annual Mandalam-Makaravilakku pilgrim season on November 16.
As many as three lakh cans of Aravana had already been produced as on Wednesday afternoon. He said the TDB had stocked sufficient quantity of materials for preparing Aravana at Sabarimala.
Quality control
Mr. Jayakumar said the board had initiated a fool-proof quality-control mechanism at its ‘prasadom’ preparation units at Sabarimala, ensuring procurement of superior quality materials, especially jaggery and rice, supplied by contractors for making Aravana.
He said a maximum of 1,50,000 cans of Aravana could be produced at the mechanised plant on a daily basis. Aravana would be in high demand at Sabarimala during the two-month Mandalam-Makaravilakku festival and Dhanalakshmi Bank had been entrusted with the task of Arvana ticket sales and distribution. The bank had made arrangements to sell Aravana tickets at its branches across the country and at Sabarimala, he said.
Production of Appam would begin on November 12 so as to produce a buffer stock of five lakh packets by November 16, he said.
A can of Aravana (250 ml) costs Rs.60 and a packet of Appam (7 nos) costs Rs.25.
Mr. Jayakumar said the TDB, in association with the Dhanalakshmi Bank, had also made arrangements for sale of Aravana and Appam tickets through all its major temples across the State.
He said the TDB was planning to distribute ‘prasadom kits’ through its counters at Sabarimala from this year.

JustDial down 27% in three months; time to log outIs it time to log out from JustDial? Hold on to the stock, say analysts
Kshitij Anand, ECONOMICTIMES.COM Oct 29, 2014, 04.56PM IST
(This is a very competitive…)
NEW DELHI: JustDial Ltd has plunged nearly 27 per cent in a matter of just three months from its record high of Rs 1894.70 hit earlier this year on 5th August, 2014, on the Bombay Stock Exchange. So, is it time for investors to book profit in the stock? May be not, say experts.
Just Dial enjoyed a good growth over the last one year, which is evident from the movement of its stock price. The stock has more than doubled from its issue price of Rs 530/share in a little over a year's time.
However, their business plans of expansion are making investors cautious and more selling could come in the stock after the surge over the last few months, say analysts.
"'Search Plus' could be a good initiative and would also de-risk the current business model of the company," said Tushar Pendharkar- Equity Strategist, Right Horizons Financial Services.
"However, the company is planning to raise Rs 1000 crore for this new line of business, which would further dilute the earnings per share. Therefore, it would be very early to comment on the performance of this new line of business for the next couple of years," he added.
This is a very competitive segment with quite a few established players and a lot of other players entering the segment at fast pace, say analysts. Investors would therefore may wait and monitor the progress of Just Dial in this segment.
Just Dial posted Q2 results with net profit margin going up by 9 per cent, which was below the average estimates. The EBITDA margin was also down for Just Dial YoY mainly because of the increase in staffing costs as the organization expands its business.
"Just Dial is a good long-term stock for investors, but it would be better to buy it on dips rather than at current levels," said Kiran Kumar Kavikondala, Director & CEO, WealthRays Securities.
Apart from earnings, one of the major reasons outlined by analysts is the fact that there is no clarity from the management side about its plan on inorganic growth or adding another business line to the existing one.
"This is a major reason behind the investors being nervous about JustDial's fund raising plans," said Vivek Gupta, CMT - Director Research, CapitalVia Global Research Limited.
The company is planning to raise another Rs 1000 crore via equity and equity linked securities, but that would also dilute earnings per share. This was despite the company having cash reserves of about Rs 750 crore on its books.
However, the management clarified that funds would be raised only if an appropriate opportunity arose. Otherwise they are going to let the resolution pass.
"Let me put it very clear. The money is not going to be raised in the couple of quarters. Let us be very clear on that unless, as we mentioned, an opportunity comes out," said Ramkumar Krishnamachari, CFO, Just Dial. "Now, if I do not see any opportunity, strategic opportunity to utilise this money, I am not going to raise it," he clarified in an interview with ET Now.
"The board has given broader enabling resolution. Should I not find any suitable utilisation of this cash, I am not going to raise the money and let the resolution pass and expire. I am very clear on that," added Krishnamachari.
What should investors do with the stock?
Despite a significant revenue growth in past several quarters, the company is struggling to maintain bottom-line performance. The stock is currently trading at the TTM P/E of 81.1x, P/B of 16.74x and EV/EBITDA of 63x.
"At such a higher valuation, it is certain that the investors would expect continued significant performance from the company," said Pendharkar, adding that "I would suggest to hold the stock and would also recommend for a 'wait & watch' strategy."
Currently the stock is trading around 1445. "If the stock manages to sustain above 1480, we can expect further upside in the stock till the level of 1600," said experts.
"The stock has an important support at 1349.Traders who are still holding Just Dial should place a stop loss of 1284 & hold it," said Gupta of CapitalVia Global Research Ltd.

More than global cues, government action to determine market movement in near term: P Phani Sekhar

(More is in the pipeline.…)
In a chat with ET Now, P Phani Sekhar , Fund Manager-PMS at Angel Broking, shares his views on the market as well as some sectors and stocks. Excerpts:
ET Now: For the moment, it appears that the markets are drifting. Do you think they could drift more?
P Phani Sekhar: I think they could drift more for the simple reason that you do not have any great global cues. On Thursday, you would have the first indication of what the FED is most likely to do on interest rates. But again, my own expectation is that for the next six months or so, there would not be any change in interest rates.
Globally, the slowdown in growth rates has dampened the sentiment quite a bit, but that is more or less factored in risk assets. You have commodities that have corrected significantly, you have equity markets that have been volatile. But the action is actually in India and I strongly believe that our future in the next six months in terms of equity markets will be more determined by what New Delhi does than what happens across the globe.
To that extent, if we are holding ourselves around 8000 levels on the Nifty, it is mainly due to the strong reform measures that the government has started initiating in the last 10 days or so. As per all media reports, more is in the pipeline. As long as that happens, even if the global environment remains a little subdued, we should be reasonably okay.
ET Now: What do you make of the pharma numbers so far? With the exception of Ranbaxy, there is no good news. Do you think pharma stocks run the risk of underperformance?
P Phani Sekhar: The initial reaction to the numbers has been negative. That is expected, but the overall long-term story for them still remains intact. More importantly, pharma is deriving advantage because of the TINA factor. You still do not have the conviction in the infrastructure-led stories, which is a large part of the market if it blooms, for people to start pulling their money out of the consumer and pharma names and start deploying their money in those sectors.
While it is true that a lot of midcaps in the infra sector have run up, conviction is still low there. As long as conviction remains low in those sectors, I guess the pharma stocks will continue to maintain their premium multiples. Hence, I do not think of any meaningful underperformance from these stocks going forward and on lower levels - maybe another 3 to 5 per cent from these levels - you will find renewed buying interest.
ET Now: What is it that you have made of the banking pack and the move on the banking stocks of late? Today you are seeing some profit-taking setting in. Is it time to revisit some of the PSU names perhaps?
P Phani Sekhar: We have always been sceptical about PSU names. All private banks have held their own. To that extent, we have no concern out there. The story remains one of conviction, which is that you go and buy private banks. If it declines, there will be better margin of safety for you. As far as PSU banks were concerned, while the structural concerns remained, the only silver lining this quarter has been their investment book. That again seems to be dwarfed by the kind of asset quality concerns that you have started seeing.
Thus, the asset quality concern seems to be a recurring theme. While you do not have any fresh slippages, what is happening is whatever they had restructured in the last two years, those assets are struggling to become standard assets. You are facing fresh slippages from the restructured basket. Thus, more or less, the story remains the same and I feel that although the stocks remain optically cheap, it is not a good idea to get into PSU banks.
ET Now: Why are IT stocks suffering? There was nothing wrong with the numbers. In fact, most of the IT companies have gone on record saying that FY15 will be better than FY14, but the markets are not paying any attention to that management commentary. What do you think?
P Phani Sekhar: It is a bit surprising. However, the IT valuations again are reasonable or are fair. They are not as premium as pharma or consumer names, nor are they very cheap. What has happened in IT is, here is a story of relative disappointments both in the case of HCL Tech as well as TCS which had made themselves sort of invincible when it came to beating industry consensus growth for many quarters now. Hence, when you saw more human performance from TCS and HCL Tech, the market got disappointed. At the same time if you see, Infosys has still done well because, on a relative basis, it did well compared to its tepid expectations.

US benchmark 10-year debt yields rose to three-week highs on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve ended its asset purchase program.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW YORK: US benchmark 10-year debt yields rose to three-week highs on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve ended its asset purchase program and said recovery in the world's largest economy remained largely on track despite weakness in other parts of the world.
This was a more optimistic statement from the Fed on the US economy than what markets participants expected. As a result, US two-year yields, the most sensitive part of the curve to the Fed's statement, posted its largest one-day jump since early 2011
Yields for US 10-year notes, meanwhile, have climbed in six of the last seven sessions, reflecting investor confidence in prospects for the US economy, and the Fed's statement has bolstered the market's positive view.
The statement from the Federal Open Market Committee, which came after a two-day meeting, highlighted an improving US labor market for its more upbeat economic outlook. Interest rates, however, would remain low for a "considerable time," the Fed said.
"Bottom line is that this is a bit more optimistic than before with some enthusiasm for labor market and household spending," said David Ader, head of government bond strategy at CRT Capital in Stamford, Connecticut.
Ader, however, said inflation remains an issue given lower energy prices.
In mid-afternoon trading, benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were down 10/32 in price and yielding 2.321 per cent. Yields hit a three-week high of 2.362 per cent following the Fed statement.
US 30-year bond also touched a three-week peak, but was last at 3.041 per cent, a session low. Traders said market participants had covered short positions on 30-year bonds when key technical levels were hit.
US two-year debt prices, meanwhile, were down 3/32 in price, yielding 0.489 per cent. It earlier hit a session high of 0.493 per cent.
Barclays in a research note said the Fed statement was still consistent with a mid-2015 tightening.
"We think today's statement emphasizes that tightening will proceed based on labor market progress, and external factors are only likely to interfere with that process to the extent that they seem to be slowing the labor market," said Dean Maki, Barclays chief US economist in New York.

US Fed ends bond buying  confident of US rec...Federal Reserve ends bond buying, exhibits confidence in US recovery
By Reuters | 30 Oct, 2014, 12.25AM IST
The Fed statement retained its guidance on rates, saying they would likely remain near zero for a "considerable time" following the end of the bond purchases.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
WASHINGTON: The Federal Reserve on Wednesday ended its monthly bond purchase program and dropped a characterization of US labor market slack as "significant" in a show of confidence in the economy's prospects.
In a statement after a two-day meeting, the central bank largely dismissed recent financial market volatility, dimming growth in Europe and a weak inflation outlook as unlikely to undercut progress toward its unemployment and inflation goals.
"On balance, a range of labor market indicators suggests that underutilization of labor resources is gradually diminishing," the Fed's policy panel said in an important departure from prior statements, which had described the slack as "significant."
"The committee continues to see sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy," it said.
US stocks added to earlier losses after the statement but came back to close down only marginally, while the yield on the 5-year US Treasury note jumped, putting it on track for its biggest one-day increase since mid-March. The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note was little changed.
The dollar rose to a three-week high against a broad basket of currencies as traders pulled forward expectations of when the Fed would eventually raise interest rates.
Rate futures shifted to show better-than-even odds of a rate increase in September 2015; previously, they had pointed to a hike in October. The Fed has held rates near zero since December 2008 and has more than quadrupled its balanced sheet to $4.4 trillion through three separate asset purchase programs.
"The market is saying that the Fed has now stepped closer to tightening interest rates because of the labor market," said Andrew Wilkinson, chief market analyst at Interactive Brokers LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut.
The Fed also added broad, flexible language that ties the timing and pace of any future rate hike to incoming economic data, as Fed Chair Janet Yellen has stressed in recent remarks.
While the central bank retained its basic guidance that overnight borrowing costs would remain near zero for a "considerable time" following the end of bond purchases this month, the new phrase marks a turn towards a new regime.
"If incoming information indicates faster progress toward the committee's employment and inflation objective than the committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than currently anticipated," the statement said.
ROUNDING UP THE VOTES
The changes in language seemed to accommodate the concerns of Fed officials worried the central bank was falling out of step with improvements in the economy. Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser and Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher, who dissented at the previous meeting last month, voted in favor of the statement this time.

Institutional investors get choosy after seeing over 50% erosion in some of their investments

(After seeing the value of…)
MUMBAI: Companies looking to raise money through share sales are facing a tough time finding investors. After seeing the value of some of their investments erode by as much as 50% in the last few months, institutional investors are increasingly getting choosy about their bets, prompting companies to put their fundraising plans on hold or cut the offer price.
At least seven companies are waiting on the sidelines as they are not confident of favourable investor responses, said two people with knowledge of this. These include JP Associates, JP Infratech, Astral Poly Technik and GVK Power , besides staterun Indian Overseas Bank (IOB) and IDBI Bank. The trend could also affect the government's ambitious disinvestment plans as it will lose the upper hand on pricing. While JP Associates has been trying to sell its treasury shares, Astral and GVK have been looking to issue fresh stock.
Kolkata based power distributor CESC, which recently concluded its qualified institutional placement (QIP), had to cut the offer to about Rs 650 crore against Rs 900-1,000 crore planned earlier after scaling down valuation expectations.
Ahmedabad-based Astral has been deferring its share placement due to differences with potential investors over pricing. An email query sent to JP Associates and GVK did not elicit a response. Astral Poly's chief financial officer (CFO) Hiranand Savlani said in an email: "We, from the management side, never support these kind of market rumors." CESC declined to comment.
In the case of IOB and IDBI Bank, the public sector lenders have been unable to find enough investors because of worries about their non-performing loans, people said. The government may also defer its disinvestment of shares in SAIL by a few weeks due to the "lukewarm" investor response at various roadshows, said a banker. This is just one of the companies that the government is looking to sell shares in as part of a programme to raise a record Rs 60,000 crore in this fiscal year. Investors said they are wary of putting money in companies in manufacturing, power and oth-er sectors after having lost heavily in some of the QIPs launched in June and July.
For instance, investments in JP Associates' QIP July issue are down 57%, while those in Reliance Communications have dropped 31%. "Some of the earlier experiences have made us uncomfortable. Some of them are good investments over a period of time but the kind of losses we are sitting on makes it difficult for us to commit more funds," said S Naren, chief investment officer, ICICI Prudential Asset Management.
Bankers said the decline in foreign investor interest in Indian stocks is also making it difficult for companies to raise money. So far in October, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have turned net sellers for the first time in 2014, dumping shares worth about Rs 3,200 crore. In June and July, traditional FIIs refused to invest in many of the QIPs of companies with hazy earnings prospects.
But hedge funds stepped in after spotting trading opportunities. Bankers said a sizeable chunk of investments in such QIPs by hedge funds was part of a trading strategy involving shares and futures contracts of the respective companies. Fund managers said there will be demand for shares that are valued right. "We still believe if PSUs are attractively priced, there would be buyers," said Naren.

NEW YORK: US stocks closed with slight losses on Wednesday, finishing off their lows of the session, after the Federal Reserve ended its stimulative monthly bond-buying program and expressed confidence in US economic prospects.
Major indexes were volatile following the central bank's statement, with the S&P 500 down as much as 0.8 per cent before pulling back. Material shares were lower throughout the session, a decline in Facebook pressured the Nasdaq, but strength in energy and financial shares helped the market recover.
In a statement after a two-day meeting, the Fed ended its quantitative easing program of bond purchases, as had been expected. At its peak, the program pumped $85 billion a month into the financial system. The Fed also dropped a characterization of US labor market slack as "significant" in a show of confidence in the economy's prospects.
"The Fed had a little more of a hawkish bent than the market expected, but any weakness that came from the statement was obviously viewed as a buying opportunity," said Alan Gayle, director of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments in Atlanta, Georgia.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 31.44 points, or 0.18 per cent, to 16,974.31, the S&P 500 lost 2.75 points, or 0.14 per cent, to 1,982.3 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 15.07 points, or 0.33 per cent, to 4,549.23.
Material shares fell 1.3 per cent after DuPont said there were "competitive advantages" to keeping its businesses together. Activist investor Nelson Peltz has urged DuPont to separate its various businesses in a move that has supported the company's shares. Shares of DuPont lost 1.7 per cent to $66.80.
Facebook Inc fell 6.1 per cent to $75.86 the day after the social network announced an increase in spending in 2015 and projected a slowdown in revenue growth this quarter.
After the market closed, shares of Visa Inc rose 3.6 per cent to $222.40. Visa reported its fourth-quarter results and announcing a stock buyback program of $5 billion.
Despite the turn lower, equities mostly held onto recent gains, with the S&P 500 up 6.4 per cent over the last nine sessions as earnings have mostly been strong. So far this reporting season, 75.3 per cent of S&P 500 companies have exceeded profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, above the long-term average of 63 per cent.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,763 to 1,322, for a 1.33-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 1,437 issues fell and 1,245 advanced for a 1.15-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.
The benchmark S&P 500 index posted 65 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 114 new highs and 35 new lows.
About 7.08 billion shares traded on all US platforms, according to BATS exchange data, below the month-to-date average of 7.86 billion.

Investors sue ICICI for bad fund record
Special Correspondent
economy, business and finance
69 NRIs go to Mauritius Supreme Court alleging wrong real estate investments in India
A group of 69 non-resident Indian investors have moved the Supreme Court of Mauritius seeking $103 million (Rs. 618 crore) in damages from the ICICI group for a fund that under-performed
The petitioners allege that the Dynamic India Fund III invested in real estate projects in India that failed miserably, though the promoters, ICICI Venture and ICICI Bank, made tall promises while mobilising funds. Dismissing the claims as baseless, ICICI Venture has said it will contest the charges legally.
“A plaint with summons was lodged before the Supreme Court of Mauritius by a group of NRI and foreign investors against [DIF III] … ICICI Bank and the Western India Trustee And Executor Co. Ltd.,” Banymandhup Boolell Chambers, the legal firm handling the case for the petitioners, said in a press statement.
The petition says the ICICI firms invested in 13 projects, of which three in Hyderabad and two in Mumbai consumed 60 per cent of the corpus despite the original plan of spreading the investments to projects in cities across India.
“Even after completion of nine years of the investments, except for one, none of these [projects] was completed as stated in their [ICICI firms] Report of March 2014,” the legal firm said.
Township in Chennai
Work on a township project in Chennai, in which the fund invested, has not even commenced after nine years because of serious infrastructure problems, it added. Two or three projects are in dire financial liquidity problems. The fund has exited from only one project in Pune after eight years, that too after it considerably underperformed, the statement said.
“Thus, it is a classic case of total neglect of due diligence, research of suitability taking into account of exit term, outrageous underestimation of cost and completion, alleged negligence and overt manipulation of the finances for escalating costs and serious blunders in judgment of selection of projects,” their statement said.
The investors have urged the court to order the respondents to pay them jointly $103 million together with interest.

Swearing-in ceremony to be held tomorrow
Maharashtra’s Chief Minister designate Devendra Fadnavis is expected to keep the Finance portfolio and may even end up handling the Home department, BJP sources said. The swearing-in ceremony of the new cabinet will be held on Friday.
Highly placed sources told The Hindu that senior leader Vinod Tawde is keen on the Home portfolio but the party high command would prefer Mr Fadnavis to handle it.
While portfolios are still to be finalised, senior leader Eknath Khadse who was hoping for the CM's post could get the revenue portfolio. Sudhir Mungantiwar, a close aide of Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, is said to be gunning for the rural and urban development departments.
Pankaja Munde, daughter of the late Gopinath Munde, is said to be keen on the high profile irrigation portfolio but may be considered inexperienced. Mr Tawde could end up with the public works portfolio instead of Home, sources said. The role of the speaker will be crucial with the government soon facing a trust vote. The party is hoping to persuade senior leader Girish Bapat for the job.

Viability gap funding for Vizhinjam port projectUpdated: October 30, 2014 12:34 IST
Viability gap funding for Vizhinjam port project

Centre recommends funding of Rs.800 crore
The Vizhinjam international seaport and container transshipment terminal project has cleared another hurdle with the Union government recommending it for viability gap funding.
A.S. Suresh Babu, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Vizhinjam International Seaport Ltd. (VISL), said the Centre had recommended the project for a viability gap funding of Rs.800 crore, 20 per cent of the latest estimate of Rs.4,000 crore for the first stage.
Mr. Babu said the viability gap funding clearance would boost investor confidence in the project since it signalled the involvement of the Government of India. “It has significantly enhanced the prospects of getting a good concessionaire.”
The bidding process to select a private partner is progressing. VISL hopes to complete the tendering process by December, paving the way for commencement of work. The viability gap funding amount will be disbursed through banks to the selected concessionaire.
Five major port operating companies — Gammon Infrastructure Projects, the Hyundai-Concast consortium, Essar Ports, Adani Ports, and Srei- OHL, a consortium of Srei Infra and Spanish construction firm Obras-con Huarte Lain — are in the fray for the bid to build the port superstructure and operate the proposed deepwater container transshipment terminal. The State government had earlier sought viability gap funding for the project, proposed to be set up through the design, build, finance, operate, and transfer mode.
Minister for Ports K. Babu has welcomed the Centre’s decision. He said Vizhinjam was the first port project in India and the first project in Kerala to receive funding under the viability gap funding mechanism.

Investors await outcome of Fed policy meet
Mumbai, Oct 29:  
The Sensex and the Nifty surged nearly 0.8 per cent on continued buying by participants amid good quarterly earnings and a firm trend overseas as investors await the outcome of the US Federal Reserve policy meeting.
Besides, covering-up of short positions by speculators ahead of monthly expiry in the derivatives segment, supported the rally.
World stocks rose on Wednesday, lifted by strong corporate earnings and investor optimism that the US Federal Reserve won’t raise interest rates for some time, even as it is expected to officially wind down its bond-buying stimulus programme.
The 30-share BSE index Sensex surged 217.35 points to end at 27,098.17 and the 50-share NSE index jumped 62.85 points to close at 8,090.45.
Sectoral indices
Barring healthcare and banking, all other BSE sectoral indices ended significantly in the green. Among them, realty index gained the most by 2.97 per cent, followed by metal 2.63 per cent, auto 1.79 per cent and IT 1.47 per cent. On the other hand, healthcare index was down 0.29 per cent and banking 0.23 per cent.
Gainers, losers
Hindalco, Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Infosys and SSLT were the top five gainers among 30-share Sensex constituents, while the top five losers were NTPC, Sun Pharma, Dr Reddy's, Bharti Airtel and SBIN.
Sustained FII buying
Brokers said besides sustained buying by investors on hopes of further reforms and encouraging earnings by some more blue-chip companies, covering-up of short positions by speculators in view of tomorrow’s monthly expiry in the derivatives segment, influenced the trading sentiment.
In addition, a firm trend in global markets following overnight gains in the US, accelerated buying activity on the domestic bourses here, they said.
European shares
Europe’s main indices followed the overnight lead from Wall Street and Asia, although the third-quarter earnings reports out of Europe were not quite as solid as those from the United States.
The dollar was under light selling pressure and major government bond yields were marginally lower, as currency and fixed income markets anticipated a soothing message from the Fed when it ends its two-day policy meeting later in the day.
Around Europe, the UK’s FTSE 100 index was up 0.7 per cent, Germany’s DAX index up 0.7 per cent, and France’s CAC 40 up 0.1 per cent.
MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 1.1 per cent and Japan’s Nikkei share average climbed 1.5 per cent.
The Fed is widely expected to announce that it will end its two-year-old stimulus programme known as quantitative easing three, as the US economy continues to gather momentum. The Fed started buying bonds as far back as late 2008.
Still, Fed officials have also stressed that they are in no hurry to take policy tightening a step further by raising rates from near zero levels due to subdued inflation and the poor quality of a recovery in labour markets.

Delhi Lt Governor to hold talks with political parties on govt formationDelhi Lt Governor to hold talks with political parties on govt formation
PTI
Delhi Lt Governor, Najeeb Jung.
New Delhi, Oct 29:  
Delhi Lt Governor Najeeb Jung has decided to invite political parties to explore the possibility of government formation in Delhi, a day after Supreme Court’s rap over delay in taking a decision on the issue.
Jung, who had come back from abroad last night, met Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh this morning and apprised him of his move to call the parties before taking a final decision on ending the political uncertainty in Delhi which is under President’s Rule since February after AAP government’s resignation.
“In view of the President’s approval to explore the possibility of installing a popular government in Delhi, the Lt Governor would be exploring the possibilities with the leaders of all political parties over the next few days,” LG’s office said.
Sources in LG’s office said BJP, the single largest party in the Assembly, may be invited “at the earliest” to know their views on government formation followed by AAP and Congress.
Yesterday, the Centre had informed the Supreme Court that President Pranab Mukherjee had accepted a proposal by the LG to invite the BJP to take a shot at power in Delhi.
Hearing a petition filed by AAP seeking dissolution of the Assembly, a five-judge Bench of the apex court headed by Chief Justice H L Dattu had put the issue on a fast forward mode as it slammed the Centre and the Lt Governor over delay in taking a decision on government formation.
The case will come up for hearing again tomorrow.
The BJP appeared undecided on taking a shot at power even as a number of its senior leaders, including party President Amit Shah and Union Ministers Nitin Gadkari and Rajnath Singh, were learnt to be in favour of the party forming a government.
Though Delhi BJP leaders maintained that a “final decision” on whether to go for polls or form a government was yet to be taken, Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu had said yesterday that the party was ready for elections.
The AAP and Congress have accused BJP of “running away” from the elections by not taking a decision on whether to end President’s rule.
Currently BJP, along with ally Akali Dal’s lone MLA, has 29 legislators and will require the support of five more MLAs to prove majority in the 67-member assembly if it decides to form the government.
The party is hopeful of getting support of expelled AAP MLA Vinod Kumar Binny and Independent MLA from Mundka Ramvir Shokeen in case it decides to form the government.
BJP had emerged as the single largest party in the December Assembly polls winning 31 seats but fell four seats short of a simple majority. It refused to form the government then, saying it will not resort to any “unfair means” to take over the reins.
Its strength came down to 28 after the Lok Sabha polls as three MLAs Harsh Vardhan, Ramesh Bidhuri and Pervesh Verma were elected to Parliament. With their resignation, the strength of the Assembly also went down to 67. The bypolls to the three seats will be held on November 25.
AAP had formed the government in Delhi with the support of Congress. The government led by Kejriwal had resigned on February 14 after the party’s pet project, the Janlokpal Bill, could not be passed due to opposition from BJP and Congress.
President’s Rule was imposed in Delhi on February 17.
Jung had not favoured dissolution of the Delhi Assembly as recommended by the council of ministers headed by Kejriwal and kept the Assembly in suspended animation.
Kejriwal today demanded that the LG call an all-party meeting and take a decision on the future of course of action.

Nilofar weakening over water ahead of turn towards GujaratNilofar weakening over water ahead of turn towards Gujarat
Vinson Kurian
Thiruvananthapuram, October 29:  
The very severe cyclone Nilofar has started weakening even before changing track towards the Gujarat coast.
The European Centre for Medium-Term Weather Forecasts finds the storm dying out over the sea over the next couple of days. India Met Department sees it crossing the coast as a minimal cyclone.
Peaks over
Earlier in the morning, Nilofar had peaked to wind speeds of up to 210 km/hr gusting to 220 km/hr. This had beaten predecessor Hudhud that ravaged the Visakhapatnam coast on October 12.
According to India Met, the landfall is expected to take place on Friday night/Saturday morning with wind speeds dramatically winding down to 80-90 km/hr with gusts of 100 km/hr.
By Wednesday noon, the storm was located to 860 km south-southwest of Naliya in Gujarat and 380 km east-southeast of Masirah Island of Oman.
Nilofar storm would start changing course away from Masirah by Thursday morning, first to north-northeast and then north-east.
Westerly influence
This would be overseen by a passing western disturbance. Originating in the Mediterranean, western disturbances travel periodically across the Arabian Gulf, Afghanistan and Pakistan into north-west India.
Nilofar happened to cross the path of one such, and would be pummelled into submission by the westerly system and dragged along.
Thus, it would be guided to Gujarat by Friday night/Saturday morning, and a remnant would roll into east Rajasthan and south-west Uttar Pradesh, dropping showers along the way.
Meanwhile in the south, the Bay of Bengal is promising to spin up a low-pressure area during the next few days even as Nilofar re-orients itself towards Gujarat.
‘Low’ in bay
The ‘low’ would mature by November 5 and intensify a round before landing up over Andhra Pradesh and adjoining Odisha coast three days later.
The system will cut open a trough along the east coast towards Kanyakumari, encircling the peninsular tip and covering adjoining Sri Lanka before extending north along India’s west coast.
It is likely that a potent circulation builds within the trough over Sri Lanka, according to the European agency’s outlook valid until November 8.
Presence of the trough around the peninsula topped up with ‘low’ off Andhra Pradesh and over Sri Lanka should bring rain of varying intensity to India’s peninsular coasts.

Cotton  groundnut crops in Gujarat face trouble as cyclone Nilofar heads to KutchCotton, groundnut crops in Gujarat face trouble as cyclone Nilofar heads to Kutch

Unseasonal rain likely to affect quality, productivity
Ahmedabad, October 29:  
Though cyclone Nilofar is slated to weaken before its landfall near Naliya in Kutch, cotton and groundnut farmers in the coastal regions of Gujarat could be in for a spell of trouble.
Heavy rainfall triggered by the cyclonic storm could damage kharif crops. However, the Gujarat administration and farmer bodies have stepped up their preparations to avert the impending danger to the maximum possible extent.
However, the standing crop of cotton and groundnut in parts of Saurashtra, Kutch and North Gujarat could be adversely hit by the unseasonal rains.
India Meteorological Department has predicted heavy to moderate rains along the coastal districts of Gujarat, including Kutch, Porbandar, Jamnagar and Devbhumi Dwarka till November 1.
“Even if the velocity of the wind is lower, rains will damage the bolls in cotton as water could seep inside it. This will affect the quality and productivity,” said NM Sharma, Managing Director, Gujcot.
Harvests at risk
However, the first plucking has almost been completed in most regions, but for the long-duration plants, subsequent plucking may be affected.
“We have advised farmers not to make fresh harvest for the next two-three days. Also, whatever has been harvested should be kept in safe and dry places,” said Mukesh Parmar, District Agriculture Officer, Kutch.
Gujarat has over 30 lakh hectares of area under cotton cultivation, while groundnut sowing has been done on about 12.25 lakh hectares.
For government officials, groundnut is a worry too.
“Cyclonic rains will damage groundnut lying in the fields. Most of the crop is ready as farmers had begun harvesting about a fortnight ago; however, about 40 per cent crop is still to be harvested,” said a State Agriculture Department official in Rajkot.
The Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) in the regions have also advised farmers not to bring farm produces for trading for the next two days.
“We have decided to keep market yard closed for fresh arrivals on November 1,” said Mahesh Vadodaria, Secretary, Gondal APMC, one of the largest APMCs in the State.
The current situation is akin to the one witnessed in 2010 when unseasonal rains affected cotton and groundnut crops, especially in the Saurashtra region.

India moves up 8 places on Global Hunger IndexIndia moves up 8 places on Global Hunger Index
Our Bureau
Tweet
New Delhi, October 29:  
One-third of India’s women and children under the age of five are underweight and face micronutrient deficiencies. The country, however, is making progress against hunger, as India moved up eight places from last year on the Global Hunger Index (GHI) to rank 55th out of 76 nations.
“India is home to a third of the world’s stunted children. There is significant opportunity for us to help our children reach their full potential not only through direct feeding programmes but also through improved access to toilets and empowerment of their mothers,” said Ramanan Laxminarayan, Vice-President (Research & Policy), Public Health Foundation of India.
He was speaking at a two-day ‘Together for Nutrition 2014’ conference held by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), here on Wednesday, jointly hosted by ‘Transform Nutrition’ (TN) and POSHAN, looks to trigger leadership for nutrition at various geographical levels.
Steady growth
India’s improved standing on the GHI index was almost driven by key data released by the Government, said Purnima Menon, Senior Research Fellow, IFPRI and Co-Director, POSHAN.
“Broadly, the reason for the decline was steady economic growth due to which numerous social sector programmes were initiated, even if the implementation has been shaky,” she told reporters.
Marie Ruel, Director of IFPRI’s Poverty, Health and Nutrition division, said, “The data for India had not been updated so what was being used prior to this report was from 2005. The big change is mainly due to the new data and it’s a 10-year change.”
The 2014 GHI report ranked nations on three equally weighted indicators, among them the proportion of underweight children under the age of five. It mentions that the underweight children data it used for India was provisional, based on a survey conducted by the Ministry of Women and Child Development with UNICEF support in 2013-14. The national underweight estimate was the first in eight years and at 30.7 per cent, it was a substantial fall from 43.5 per cent as recorded in 2005-06.

Cycle brand agarbatti worried about new entrants
Amrita Nair-Ghaswalla
Smaller and regional players in the agarbatti market has got market leader Cycle brand worried.
The incense industry boasts over 200 players, who have some 400 agarbatti brands between them.
Competition
ITC’s Mangaldeep agarbatti is the only national competitor for Mysore-based NR Group, owner of the Cycle agarbattis.
Arjun Ranga, Partner of NR Group, says the market is dominated by local players.
“Region-specific players are very strong. Like Devdarshan in Haryana, Vasu in Karnataka, Tiranga in Uttar Pradesh, Ambica Durbar in Andhra, or even Haridarshna and Zed Black in Delhi. Some of these brands have been there for a long time. How they sustain is interesting, since it is a tough market,” he adds.
Ranga says earlier agarbatti manufactured in Karnataka were known for their quality but now manufacturers from Odisha and Madhya Pradesh are well-known too.
For the NR Group, it is the marketing muscle of ITC that is a closely watched affair. “When we came up with 3-in-1 agarbatti, Mangaldeep brought in 5-in-1,” says Ranga.
Ranga says there has been little innovation to help the market grow. “When newer, bigger entrants come into the market, one expects expansion and more retail outlets to open up. It has not happened,” says Ranga.
Ranga added that the NR Group would continue to be innovative and add newer fragrances.

Tata Steel’s Canadian partner to cut jobs
Jayanta Mallick
30% reduction in workforce may help New Millennium save C$1.52 m annually
Kolkata, October 29:  
Canadian miner New Millennium Iron Corporation (NML) has decided to downsize its workforce by around 30 per cent.
Tata Steel has a 26.2 per cent stake in the company.
The company said it would implement the “human resource restructuring plan”, which included a workforce reduction of 12 full-time employees, or around 30 per cent of the company’s total strength of 38 people.
Through the job cuts, NML expects to save C$1.52 million ($1.35 million) annually. However, the severance packages would entail a one-time cost, which is now being worked out.
The company said the restructuring exercise was in response to the present difficult commodity market.
“One-time charges associated with the restructuring are currently being finalised,” it said in a statement to the Toronto Stock Exchange. The restructuring will take place in the fourth (October-December) quarter, it added.
Combined with other cost-saving measures undertaken this year, the restructuring is expected to provide NML with sufficient working capital to support activities through 2016 at current expenditure levels. The company also wants to conserve resources for its proposed low-grade iron ore (taconite) project.
NML has already begun trial shipping of ores to Tata Steel’s European operations.
Tata Steel has exclusive option for entire offtake of produce from this direct shipping ore project.
The DSO Project is owned and operated by Tata Steel Minerals Canada Ltd (TSMC), an 80:20 per cent joint venture of Tata Steel and NML. The investments for the taconite project, in which Tata Steel is also the strategic partner, are being firmed up.

Apparel and back-to-school merchandise to be launched by 2015
Kolkata, October 29:  
Buying an “Oxford University” t-shirt or carrying a backpack bearing the name of the iconic university, will soon be a reality in India.
Oxford University is currently in the process of firming up the licensing agreements for its merchandise that includes apparels, back-to-school products, mementos and other memorabilia.
According to Chris Evans, Managing Director, Oxford Ltd, the entire range of merchandise is expected to be available in India by 2015.
The university has already entered into agreements with some local partners and will roll out the products shortly.
Educational toys, mostly brain games, from the Oxford bran in partnership with a local partner are already available in India. “We are in the process of rolling out Oxford University products here. By 2015, we are hoping that the entire range of merchandise is available in India through the right partners,” he told BusinessLine during a recent visit to the country. Back-to-school products, that include tiffin boxes, backpacks and stationary items, are expected to be rolled out in the first half of 2015. Stationary supplies for office and school will be placed at the premium end.
Apparel
Apparel, however, are likely to be launched in the latter half of 2015. According to Evans, the university has already zeroed-in on an India-based retailer for manufacture and marketing its apparel and fashion accessories.
The apparel range will be placed in the “mid-to-premium range” and categorised in the “affordable luxury” segment. At present, UCLA (University of California and Los Angeles) and Harvard University are amongst the major global universities who sell their apparel lines in India.
Marketing
According to Evans, focus will also be on marketing the merchandise through appropriate channels like shop-in-shop formats and multi-brand outlets. Larger format stores will also be explored.

Delhi-bound train escaped firebomb attack last monthComments
A re-run of the Samjhauta Express firebombing was averted on the first day of Navratra last month when a powerful incendiary improvised explosive device (IED) was detected and disposed of from a passenger train in Rewari, Haryana, counter-terror sources told HT.
The bomb — with a timer and detonator connected to a container of liquid insect killer with firecrackers tied to it — was found in an abandoned bag on the Rewari-Meerut train on September 25, they said. The train was on its way to Delhi.
A passenger, suspicious that the bag’s owner hadn’t come back in a while, informed the railway police, who found protruding wires in the bag. “A bomb squad was called in from Gurgaon and defused the IED three hours after it was found,” one counter-terror official said on condition of anonymity.
“It is suspected that the IED was planted by alleged Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) operatives who are on the run after their hideout in Uttar Pradesh’s Bijnor town was busted last month after an accidental blast,” the official said.
A witness who was shown photographs of these men said one of them resembled the bag’s owner, the official said, adding, “These SIMI operatives had escaped from Madhya Pradesh’s Khandwa jail in October last year.”
“Had the IED exploded, it would have sent flames flying around the inflammable train coach, possibly resulting in a repeat of the Samjhauta Express firebombing,” the official added.
In 2007, incendiary IEDs planted by alleged Hindu extremists on the India-Pakistan train had killed more than 60 people, mostly Pakistanis.
 
A day after the bomb find, a senior Haryana Police officer called in counter-terror officials from the central agencies to inspect the scene. 
There were also reports that some policemen had tried to break the IED with lathis but these could not be confirmed.

Govt may bring changes to land act in winter session of ParliamentGovt may bring changes to land act in winter session of Parliament
Kumar Uttam , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 30, 2014
First Published: 00:15 IST(30/10/2014) | Last Updated: 08:27 IST(30/10/2014)

To kick-start stalled development projects and remove investment bottlenecks, the government is expected to make changes to the land acquisition act during the winter session that opens on November 24.
Dilution of the consent clause, restricting social impact assessment to large projects and giving states the powers to define “emergency” under “urgency clause” for acquiring land are some of the major amendments -- demanded by various states -- that the Centre is looking at.
Given the contentious nature of the legislation, the government was holding wide-ranging consultations to ensure a smooth sailing when the amendments are tabled in Parliament, said sources.
Last week, finance minister Arun Jaitley, rural development minister Nitin Gadkari and many RSS leaders deliberated over the implications of the proposed changes. While there was unanimity on the need to amend the Act, passed by the UPA government, the leaders were in agreement that farmers’ rights should be protected at any cost.
“Senior ministers are of the view that only those amendments on which there is a greater consensus should be pressed. We do not want our exercise to lead to a standoff with opposition parties. The amendment bill will be finalised within a couple of weeks,” a source privy to the development said. 
A note about proposed changes was circulated during the high tea that Prime Minister Narendra Modi hosted for NDA MPs on October 26. It was taken back after the Parliamentarians had gone through it.
In June, the Centre had discussed the changes with revenue ministers of states and all of them, including those from the Congress-ruled states, had reservation about many provisions of the Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013.
The Centre will focus on the changes on which there was consensus. “The consent clause should be re-examined, as ownership of the land vests with the government in PPP (public-private partnership) projects,” the note circulated by the rural development ministry after the revenue ministers’ conference said.
“The consent clause should be removed from PPP projects. Alternatively, consent requirement may be brought down to 50%,” the note said.
This is one of the many amendments that the Centre could move, government sources said. The government could also make changes to the social impact clause, a mandatory assessment prior to acquiring land to judge its essentiality and to identify both land and livelihood losers.
“Mandatory social impact assessment (SAI) study should be done away with. SIA should be confined to large projects/PPP projects as it may delay the acquisition process,” it has been suggested.
“States have also asked the ministry to revisit the definition of “affected family”, which some of them say was too elaborate”.
One of the proposals that figured in the note sent to the PMO says state governments should also have the powers to determine “any other emergency” under the urgency clause.
Some states also demanded that the rehabilitation and resettlement obligation should be done away with if the land was purchased with mutual consent by a private party. The Centre was also asked by states to re-examine “land for land” provision.

Shiv Sena to take call on joining BJP govt todayShiv Sena to take call on joining BJP govt today

As BJP prepared for the inauguration of its first government in Maharashtra under Devendra Fadnavis on Friday, its estranged partner Shiv Sena said it would announce its decision on whether it will be part of the BJP-led ministry on Thursday.
“We met Uddhav Thackeray and discussed the future course of action with him. The wait is over now, just one more day. We will announce our decision tomorrow,” Sena MP Sanjay Raut told reporters after Sena chief Thackeray held several rounds of talks with top party leaders during the day.
Also present in the huddle were senior Sena leaders Liladhar Dahake, Manohar Joshi, Diwakar Raote, Ramdas Kadam, Gajanan Kirtikar and Subhash Desai.
Sena sources said Uddhav himself will announce the party’s ‘final stand’.
“Discussions are on within the party. Uddhavji will take a final call (on whether to join the BJP-led ministry),” Sena spokesperson Neelam Gorhe told reporters earlier in the day outside Uddhav’s residence ‘Matoshree’.
Both BJP and Shiv Sena leaders had made conciliatory noises after Fadnavis, backed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah, was elected leader of the Legislature Party.
Talks between the two saffron parties for a tie-up were not formally on and sources in BJP had said negotiations will resume only after the new government was sworn in.
A top central BJP leader, when asked if there was any breakthrough in discussions with Sena on the latter’s joining the government, said talks would resume only after the oath- taking ceremony on October 31.
Both parties had yesterday shown signs of a rapprochement with Shiv Sena MP and spokesman Sanjay Raut saying, “The blood group of BJP and Shiv Sena is the same.” He had rubbished media reports that Sena was demanding deputy chief minister’s post and some key portfolios as pre-condition for a reunion between the former saffron allies.

New Australian law aimed at Snowden-type situationespionage and intelligence
And not investigative reporters
Australia’s attorney-general says a contentious new law that carries a prison term for anyone who reveals information about certain secret security operations was aimed at Edward Snowden-like leakers rather than investigative reporters.
Attorney-General George Brandis announced on Thursday that he was adding a safeguard for journalists who might fall afoul of a new counterterrorism law by giving the attorney-general at the time power to veto any media prosecution.
The most contentious section of counterterrorism legislation passed Wednesday by the Senate carries a potential 10-year prison sentence for anyone who discloses information that relates to a “special intelligence operation.”
Mr. Brandis says that section is primarily “intended for a Snowden-type situation,” referring to the former U.S. National Security Agency contractor who leaked thousands of classified documents.

11 500 startups to come up in India by 2020: Report11,500 startups to come up in India by 2020, says Nasscom report

As many as 11,500 startups would come up in the country employing over 2,50,000 people by 2020, according to key findings of industry body Nasscom's (National Association of Software and Services Companies) India Start-up Report 2014.
Unveiling the findings in Bangalore on Wednesday, Nasscom President R Chandrashekhar said 300 VC/PE (venture capital and private equity) and 225 angel investments deals amounting to over US $2 billion had been made in the country.
Chandrashekhar said over 20 mergers and acquisitions worth US $1 billion were done in the past three years.
As many as 3,100 startups are currently operating in the country, which is the third largest base in the world, the Nasscom President said.
Moreover, over 800 startups are being set up anually, he told reporters at the eleventh edition of the organisation's annual flagship Product Conclave in the capital city of Karnataka.
Earlier, the industry body launched its three-day annual flagship Nasscom Product Conclave 2014.
The conclave builds on the fast growing product and startup ecosystem in the country and provides a platform to engage with thought leaders in the product space and discuss issues of common interest, Chandrashekhar said.
The event will also discuss issues of network with startups and partners to create a common framework for the future of the product startup ecosystem in India, he said.
The three-day conclave will feature over 225 international and national speakers and showcase of 120 plus product companies the organisation's President said.
The Nasscom top Emerge 10 companies will also be showcased on the sidelines of the conclave, Chandrashekhar said. "These success stories are a mixture of burgeoning product innovations and exciting new solutions."
The growth of the software product industry in recent years has signalled a transformation - in the country and across the globe.
With increasing numbers of online active users becoming consumers of e-commerce solutions and related marketplaces, domestic startups are building global digital solutions to capitalise on this rapid growth, he said.
Hyper-growth, capital availability and acquisitions are the leading drivers of the growing startup ecosystem in the country, he added.
Home-grown start-ups are well positioned to address the entire Asian market opportunity and also expand beyond the US and European region, Chandrashekhar said.
"The Indian startup ecosystem is rapidly evolving driven by an extremely young, diverse and inclusive entrepreneurial landscape. This is leading to emergence of focused domain solutions for verticals like healthcare, agriculture, and education," he said.
An additional driving force is a four-fold increase in access to capital through venture capitals, angel investment and seed funding is allowing domestic entrepreneurs to work on building tailor-made products for their customers, he added.
Simultaneously, Nasscom needs to work on addressing challenges on creating supportive government policies in terms of ease of doing business, tax incentives, participation in government contracts, availability of risk capital, he added.
Nasscom will continue to actively engage with stakeholders across to address these challenges, Chandrashekhar said.
"Scaling up, Design and Growth Hacking are the key priority for startups today. On the innovation front, it is imperative to increase collaboration and partnerships for product companies with platform players, IT Services, Global MNCs and CIOs," Nasscom Product Council Chairman Ravi Gururaj said.
The 2014 conclave will showcase interesting technologies that are evangelising the product space and that are poised to become ubiquitous across both the consumer and industrial fabric of our society, Gururaj said.

Indian consumers are now splurging on expensive models of TVs, smartphones and cars
Writankar Mukherjee, ET Bureau Oct 30, 2014, 04.49AM IST

( According to trade estimates,…)
KOLKATA: Nielsen's latest global consumer confidence survey of 60 countries ranks India's consumers as the most bullish. Add biggish to the list of descriptors for Indian consumers' buying habits — data from the last two months conclusively demonstrate that not only are Indians buying lots but they are buying in bigger sizes. In smartphones, televisions and cars —three crucial categories in the durables/personal technology/lifestyle statement space — Indians have opted for bigger, and more expensive, options. Companies and retailers say the 'buy big' trend is basically a result of consumer confidence returning.
For large-sized TVs and large-screen smartphones, September-October sales have doubled on a year-on-year basis. According to trade estimates, September-October saw more than 1 million units of 40-inch and even bigger sized flat panel LED and plasma televisions being sold. The figure for the same period last year was 0.2 million units. Market tracker CMR India estimates that smartphone sales in October has hit a record high of more than 12 million units as compared to the usual of 7-8 million units in a month.
Large screen smartphones — 4.5 inches screen size, measured diagonally — priced upwards of Rs 15,000 dominated the sales.Retailers say top-selling handsets were Apple iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, Samsung's Galaxy Alpha, Note 4, Grand 2 and Prime, Sony Xperia C3, HTC 816G and Micromax Canvas Knight and Gold. As per trade estimates, all stocks of Apple's iPhone 6 and 6 Plus flew off the shelves as soon as they hit the stores, selling more than 55,000 units of the models priced between Rs 53,500 to Rs 80,500.
"Consumer sentiment has vastly improved, especially in the cities, boosted by availability of easy consumer financing, lower inflation and positive economic sentiments," said Panasonic India managing director Manish Sharma. Sharma said not only Panasonic, but several other brands are stockout in large-screen television models, especially 55 inches, 65 inches and smart televisions that cost upwards of Rs 1 lakh.
"We could not forecast this huge demand," he said. For cars, the trend has been visible longer but is sharpening now. Industry data show the super compact car segment (Etios and Dzire are examples in this category) grew in sales in 2013-14 while the cheaper mini and compact cars posted a decline in sales. And in September, among the top 10 selling passenger vehicles, only four vehicles were in smaller sizes and priced below Rs 4 lakh. The next set of data due soon is expected to further confirm this trend.
"The entry-level segment itself is modifying and moving up the value chain. Earlier Maruti 800 used to be the entry level. Now Alto has become the entry level while sales of premium segments have increased," said Vishnu Mathur, Director-General of industry body SIAM.
"The passion for bigger and better vehicles is thanks mainly due to increase in the standard of living," Mathur said. Brisk sales of SUVs and luxury sedans, say auto industry executives, also point to the buying big trend.
Renault, Ford, Mercedes Benz and Audi are automakers that have particularly benefited from the trend. The winners in the smartphone and TV versions of buy big are the usual suspects. Samsung, Sony, Panasonic, Micromax and Videocon all say recent sales of large screen TVs have been beyond expectation.
 
Videocon chief operating officer CM Singh said unit sales of 40-inch and bigger sized TVs matched sales contribution from smaller TVs — a first for the company.Samsung India spokesperson said sales over the last few weeks have exceeded expectations across all product categories and price points, and that includes the newly launched Galaxy Note 4 smartphone.

Samsung Electronics Q3 operating profit downProfit for the mobile division, which drove Samsung's earnings growth in 2012 and 2013, shrank to 1.75 trillion won from 6.70 trillion won a year earlier. 
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
SEOUL: Samsung Electronics Co Ltd saw its July-September quarterly profit fall to the lowest level in more than three years, as a decline in earnings from its smartphone business set the South Korean giant on track for its worst year since 2011.
The global smartphone leader has lost market share in annual terms for the past two quarters, lagging behind Apple Inc
in the premium market and overtaken by rivals like Lenovo Group Ltd and Xiaomi Inc at the bottom end.
Samsung on Thursday said its third-quarter operating profit fell by an annual 60.1 percent to 4.1 trillion won ($3.90 billion), matching its guidance issued earlier this month and marking the weakest result since the second quarter of 2011.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, Samsung said it "cautiously expects an earnings increase, driven by strong seasonal demand for TVs and continued growth momentum for the memory business".
However it said the mobile division's outlook remained uncertain.
Analysts expect Samsung to record its weakest annual operating profit in three years despite the launch of new gadgets like the Galaxy Note 4 phablet.
A mean forecast from a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S survey of 41 analysts tips 2014 profit at 26.4 trillion won, down from last year's record 36.8 trillion won.
Profit for the mobile division fell to 1.75 trillion won in the third quarter from 6.70 trillion won a year ago, its worst performance since the second quarter of 2011.
Samsung spent most of the quarter without launching a new flagship device and continued to struggle in the mid-to-low tier markets.
While the Galaxy Note 4 launch in September and the expected release of new products in the low end of the market during the October-December quarter are seen lifting smartphone sales slightly, analysts say the days of record mobile profits for Samsung are over.
The firm will likely have to sacrifice margins to ensure it does not lose more market share. Cheaper phones are also expected to drive global smartphone market growth in coming years, meaning a general trend of lower average selling prices.
Samsung's chips division offered support, recording a 2.26 trillion operating profit for the July-September quarter to mark the highest earnings since the third quarter of 2010.
The flat-screen panels business ran a 60 billion won profit during the July-September period, compared with a 980 billion won profit a year earlier.

Hudhud and other disasters make landfall at ...Calamities like Hudhud, Nilofar likely to contribute to insurance claims of over Rs 5,000 crore

(Industry’s hopes of turning…)
MUMBAI: Cyclone Hudhud and cyclone Nilofar are likely to contribute to insurance claims of over Rs 5,000 crore, making the current fiscal year possibly the worst in a decade for general insurers that have also taken a hit from the floods in Jammu & Kashmir.
The industry's hopes of turning in a profit this year after increasing premiums for retail categories such as automobile and health may not materialise due to these natural calamities , several executives said.Cyclone Hudhud, which hit the coast of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, resulted in total claims of Rs 4,000 crore, including crop and industrial claims.
Cyclone Nilofar is expected to hit north-west Gujarat soon with equal severity. RMS modelling agency has pegged the insured loss from cyclone Hudhud at Rs 2,400 crore, estimating with the help of catastrophe models that map the risk landscape, quantifying the impacts of natural and man-made catastrophes for the global insurance and reinsurance industry.
"This is the first time cyclone has hit the industrial belt. The two cyclones are going to jeopardise insurance companies and hopefully stop freefall of prices," said AK Roy, chairman & managing director of national reinsurer General Insurance Corporation. In the absence of claims for the past few years, the general insurance industry had been offering huge discounts on corporate policies.
The underwriting losses of nonlife insurance industry reduced 20.88% to Rs 6,984 crore in 2012-13 over the previous year due to reduction in percentage of claims incurred, as per the latest report by the Insurance Regulatory & Development Authority. Cyclone Hudhud damaged crops worth Rs 1,500 crore, about the same amount for which insurers had to settle claims last year in the wake of cyclone Phailin.
The large claim notwithstanding, the industry did not revise the premium on crop insurance. "Price correction is overdue," said Tapan Singhel, MD & CEO of Bajaj Allianz General Insurance. "We have always believed in pricing products appropriately."
After the deregulation in 2007, insurers have been undercutting each other in most lines of business. Experts say insurers need to invest in actuarial capabilities to underwrite risk and price it accordingly while the companies are focusing on grabbing market share even at a cost that could wipe them out.

Infy founders to invest up to $1 mn each in ...Infosys
(Fresh from passing on the…)
BANGALORE: Fresh from passing on the baton at Infosys, co-founders SD Shibulal and Kris Gopalakrishnan are teaming up once more to mentor and back early-stage ventures with an aim to invest up to $1 million in each startup they pick. They will set up an incubator, Axilor Ventures, along with Infosys veteran Srinath Batni, who earlier led the delivery operations at the software services company.
The announcement of the new venture is expected at the end of November. "We all have a fund of our own. The idea is to now jointly invest if we are excited about any (startup)," said Gopalakrishnan, who was the last of the co-founders to retire from Infosys earlier this month.
He declined to quantify the investment corpus saying it is "early to talk about it", but said that all investments will be "angel or seed".
Axilor will back technologyfocussed startups in areas like e-com-merce, wearable technologies, healthcare and those that develop technology for sustainable business.
"We are looking to invest anywhere between Rs 30 lakh and Rs 6 crore," said V Ganapathy Subramanian , CEO of Axilor Ventures. "There will be more clarity on the investment focus and the quantum of investments at the new venture once it is formally launched," said Subramanian, who was earlier the head of strategy and planning at Infosys.
Infosys veterans have been actively engaging with India's booming startup sector, where about 800 new ventures are set up every year according to trade body Nasscom. By 2020, nearly 11,500 startups are expected to be set up in India employing over 2.5 lakh people. The company's former finance heads Mohandas Pai and V Balakrishnan teamed up with others to set up a technology investment fund Exfinity fund, which raised Rs 125 crore in August.
Former chairman Narayana Murthy's family office runs the Catamaran Ventures, which has backed beverages makerHector Beverages and healthcare chain Wellspring Healthcare. Another co-founder NS Raghavan has set up a technology investment firm Ojas Ventures, which has backed startups like internet marketing company Vizury and interactive technology developer TELiBrahma.
Several of India's wealthy professionals are also joining the rush to direct money and mentoring to Indian startups, including Google India's head Rajan Anandan, Tata Group chairman emeritus Ratan Tata, InMobi's Naveen Tewari, Mu Sigma's Dhiraj Rajaram. Experts are of the view that startups can gain from the expertise and vast network built up by these senior executives.
"With the kind of wealth they have created, they could have done a lot of things, but they chose to incubate startups — it reaffirms potential of India's startup ecosys tem," said Lalit Ahuja, co-founder of Kyron accelerator, which sets up accelerator programmes for large companies like Target. This year, over $1 billion has been invested in early-stage ventures in India marking a near two-fold increase over the $630 million of venture capital invested in 2013 according to EY.
Startups have received a further fillip from the 40-odd accelerators and incubators, set up by both domestic technology firms and global software giants, including Google and Microsoft. "It has raised aspirations for many and we hope we can add to this," said Subramanian. Gopalakrishnan is already pursuing a role in backing startups, as chief mentor of the Startup Village, a not-for-profit incubator in Kochi.
While Shibulal, along with his wife, Kumari Shibulal, heads several philanthropic initiatives, including in education through the Samhita Academy. "Folks with a mindset are looking at incubating product companies. This is fantastic," said Sanjay Shah, founding circle member of software product think-tank iSpirt.

Drug war: Novartis  Cipla in patent fightYou are here: Home > Collections > Cipla
Cipla asks government to revoke five patents held by Novartis

(Cipla, India’s fifthlargest drugmaker by…)
NEW DELHI: Cipla, India's fifthlargest drugmaker by revenue, has asked the government to revoke five patents that Novartis holds on respiratory drug Onbrez and launched its generic version of indacaterol at a fifth of the price, triggering another confrontation between an Indian generic company and a foreign innovator firm. The domestic drugmaker asked the Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion to cancel the patents on the ground that the Swiss company has held them for six years without making the medicine locally or importing it in the quantity that's required.
It alleged that Novartis imports only about 54,000 units annually, depriving 99.9% of the 1.5 crore people in India who need the drug. "Novartis' products do not satisfy even 4,500 patients an nually and our feedback shows the product is urgently needed by the doctor and patient community," said a Cipla spokesperson. An email sent to a Novartis India spokesperson went unanswered.
Cipla's move is likely to open a new front in the ever-expanding conflict between Indian drugmakers and multinationals that goes back several decades. It's also likely to become a test case for similar instances. "This case will open Pandora's box. The government will be forced to take notice of all such cases where MNCs are holding on to patents but not launching or selling very little of their patented products. The government will have to take a stand on how it should monitor the situation," said the patent head of another top generic firm who didn't want to be named.
A senior executive at a multinational drugmaker said a company can't be forced to sell its products in any market. "It's a decision based on many factors, including commercial reasons," he said. Foreign innovator or original research companies believe that Indian drugmakers take advantage of the country's weak patent laws to launch cheaper version of their drugs, depriving them of legitimate profits.
Indian drug companies say they function within the law and by manufacturing cheaper versions they keep drug prices and healthcare costs low not just in the country but in other parts of the world as well. The government contends that India's patent laws comply with international requirements and have been designed to meet the objectives of availability, accessibility and affordability.
Many of these disputes end up in court and industry experts expect Novartis to legally challenge the launch of Cipla's generic version. Some of the high-profile innovator-generic patent battles currently going on in Indian courts include Cipla versus Swiss drugmaker Hoffman La Roche over lung cancer drug Tarceva (erlotinib); Natco Pharma vs American firm Bristol-Myer Squibb over cancer drug Sprycel (dasatinib); Glenmark and five other generic drugmakers vs US firm Merck Sharp & Dohme over diabetes drug Januvia (sitagliptin).
Cipla has launched its indacaterol generic, a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) drug, under the Unibrez brand in some parts of the country. An industry executive said the medicine was priced at about Rs 130 per pack of 10 pills, compared with Onbrez, which sells for Rs 677. A Cipla spokesperson confirmed the launch and said "Novartis' product is over 400% more expensive than Cipla's product". Interestingly, Cipla's chief executive Subhanu Saxena joined the company from Novartis, where he led its global product strategy and commercialisation functions.
In its appeal to DIPP last week, the Indian drugmaker demanded that Novartis' patents on the drug be revoked under Section 66 of Indian Patents Act. This allows the government to strike down a patent if it concludes that it has been exercised in a manner that doesn't benefit the state or public. Cipla argued that by not manufacturing the drug locally and importing only limited quantities through Indian licensee Lupin, Novartis was making"mischievous use of its patent rights", which is "detrimental to public" interest.
 
It also urged the government to consider COPD as an epidemic worthy of being qualified as a "public health crisis" as it claims 50 lakh lives annually in India, which is more than the toll from HIV-AIDS, malaria, cancer and tuberculosis.
Cipla also accused Novartis of "ever-greening", or seeking to extend its monopoly, by filing five patents for the "same or similar substance". In 2013, Novartis lost a bitterly fought patent war over cancer drug Glivec with the Indian government, when the Supreme Court turned down its plea on the ground that the substance it was seeking to patent did not enhance therapeutic efficacy over existing drugs.

Pre-market: Nifty seen opening flat; F&O expiry eyedFederal Reserve
NEW DELHI: The 50-share Nifty index is expected to open flat on Thursday following muted trend seen in other Asian markets. However, the index should be able to recoup losses and head higher to reclaim its crucial psychological level of 8,100 in trade today.
The market is likely to remain volatile as traders roll over positions in the futures & options (F&O) segment from the near month October 2014 series to November 2014 series.
At 07:30 a.m., Nifty India stock futures in Singapore were trading 11.50 points lower at 8,084.50 indicating a flat opening on the domestic market.
Nifty ended the day with gains of 62 points at 8,090 on Wednesday and most of the gains came in towards the latter half of the session. The Sensex closed 217 points higher at 27,098.
The Nifty managed to respect the support of 7,960 and maintained its uptrend for yet another day; however, it now trades near a very important resistance level of 8,100 and appears overbought on the intraday hourly charts.
"The immediate support has now shifted higher to 8,050. A move below 8,050 would produce further decline till 7,940 to 7,900 range," GEPL Capital said in a report.
"If the index continues to respect levels of 8,050 and even clears the resistance level of 8,100 convincingly, then it may inch higher till 8,150 to 8,180 range," added the report.
Overnight, U.S. stocks closed flat after the Federal Reserve ended its stimulative monthly bond-buying program and expressed confidence in U.S. economic prospects.
"In a statement after a two-day meeting, the Fed ended its quantitative easing program of bond purchases, as had been expected," Reuters reported.
"At its peak, the program pumped $85 billion a month into the financial system. The Fed also dropped a characterization of U.S. labor market slack as "significant" in a show of confidence in the economy's prospects," added the report.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 31.44 points, or 0.18 per cent, to 16,974.31, the S&P 500 lost 2.75 points, or 0.14 per cent, to 1,982.3 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 15.07 points, or 0.33 percent, to 4,549.23.

Govt submits 627 names in black money caseUpdate: Govt hands over list of 627 account holders to Supreme Court in black money case
IANS     New Delhi   Last Updated: October 29, 2014  | 13:41 IST

The government on Wednesday submitted in the Supreme Court a list of 627 names , holding black money accounts in foreign banks, revealed to it by the French government.
Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi handed over two sealed envelopes to the apex court bench headed by Chief Justice HL Dattu.
Rohatgi said that half of these account holders are residents of the country while the other half are Non-Resident Indians (or NRIs). These accounts pertain up to 2006.
The AG said that action had been initiated into the matter. Some of the account holders had paid taxes while others were under investigation, he said.
Rohatgi also told the court the Income Tax Act had been amended to extend the limitation period up to March 31, 2015, for recovering taxes from these account holders. Under the earlier provision, a limitation period for recovery of taxes was six years, which in these cases came to an end in 2012.
The SC directed that the sealed envelopes containing 627 names, including correspondence with the French government, be given to Special Investigation Team (SIT) Chairman Justice MB Shah and Vice Chairman Justice Arijit Pasayat.
The apex court said the SIT , which was set up by it on July 4, 2011, will move into the matter in accordance with the law.
All the 627 accounts are at HSBC Bank in Geneva - the details of which the government got from its French counterpart.
These are also known as stolen data and when the government approached the Swiss authorities for assistance, they refused to help, saying that they did not deal with stolen data.
However, HSBC Bank said that if the domestic authorities got an NOC from the account holders, then it would share the details. As a consequence, about 50-60 account holders gave their consent with NOC.
Rohatgi told the court that the government's only request was that nothing should impede in getting information from these countries and others on foreign accounts in future.
Directing further hearing of the matter to December 3, the SC said that the SIT team will submit its status report on the steps taken by it in pursuance to the list of the 627 account holders.
On Tuesday, the government was directed by the apex court to furnish in a sealed envelope the list of all individuals and entities in its possession who have accounts in overseas banks, legitimate or otherwise.
The directive to this effect came a day after the government gave the court the names of seven individuals and one company, alleging they had funds in bank accounts abroad over which proceedings had been initiated for tax evasion.

Unearthing black money may add $30 bn to forex reservesBlack money recovery can add USD 30 billion to forex reserves, says BofA-ML

The unearthing of black money allegedly stashed away by the citizens in Swiss banks could add US $30 billion to the country's forex reserves, says a Bank of America Merrill Lynch report.
According to the global financial services provider, though there would not be any immediate forex impact given the legal issues involved, it could add US $30-35 billion to the forex reserves over time.
Based on a recent research study, BofA-ML has worked with an estimate of capital flight of about US $200 billion.
According to the study, Raghbendra Jha and Duc Nguyen Truong, of Australian National University, estimated total capital flight of more than US $186 billion during 1998-2012.
"If even half of this is unearthed, it could add US $30-35 billion (three to four months of current import cover) to forex reserves over time," BofA-ML said in a research note on Wednesday.
The government on Wednesday submitted a list of names of 627 account holders in HSBC bank, Geneva in black money case before the Supreme Court, which asked the Special Investigation Team  (SIT) to go through the list and take appropriate action in accordance with law.
A bench headed by Chief Justice HL Dattu did not open the sealed envelope containing the names submitted by the government and said that it would be opened only by the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Supreme Court-appointed SIT.
The apex court asked the SIT to submit a status report of its probe by November-end.
Placing the sealed documents before the bench, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi said details of account holders, which were supplied by the French government to the Centre in 2011, pertained to the year 2006.
The report further noted that rupee is expected to hold Rs 58-62/US $and BofA-ML's Asia forex strategist, Adarsh Sinha, forecasts INR to be at Rs 61/US $in December.

Moody s holds negative outlook on Indian banksMoody's negative on Indian banks as corporate leverage high

High leverage in the Indian corporate sector could prevent any meaningful recovery in asset quality at lenders over the next 12-18 months, Moody's Investors Service said on Wednesday, maintaining its "negative" outlook on the country's banking sector.
Moody's estimated India's corporate sector had an average debt-to-equity ratio of more than 3 times, and would need a stronger economic recovery than currently projected by the credit agency to bring down the leverage.
"Poor asset quality will require continued provisioning and strengthened capital buffers," Moody's said.
The agency said its "negative" outlook pertained mainly to state-owned lenders that account for more than 70 per cent of banking assets.
Non-performing loans were at a three-year high, although new bad loans have peaked, Moody's said.
Industry data has shown bad loans comprise around 4 per cent of banking assets while stressed loans, which include restructured loans, account for nearly 10 per cent.

PM Modi Wants Number 50, But India Just Slipped to 142 on This List
NDTV | Written By: Varun Sinha | Updated On: October 29, 2014 17:03 (IST)
Iron Ore Imports Surge as Prices Fall
India has notched up its worst-ever ranking in the "Ease of Doing Business" index compiled by the World Bank, slipping to 142 out of 189 countries. Just last month Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said he wants India to be among the top 50 countries on the list. ( Read )
The rankings are based on 10 indicators such as how easy it is to start a business and sometimes form the basis of foreign investments in a country. The World Bank has clarified that the rankings are based on data available till May 2014 and do not take into account measures taken by the new government.
India's ranking originally stood at 134 last year, but has been now adjusted to 140 by the World Bank to account for fresh data. In 2006, when the index was launched, India ranked 116th.
According to the World Bank, India scored much higher than its overall ranking (142) in protecting minority investors (rank 7) and in ensuring credit (rank 36), but lagged behind in other parameters such as granting construction permits (184) and enforcing contracts (rank 186). ( Read the full story here )
Overall, India scored above its rank in ensuring electricity (137), registering property (121), trading across borders (126) and resolving insolvency (137), but ranked poorly in starting a business (158) and paying taxes (156) weighed on the composite standing.
The fall in rankings illustrates the urgent need for action in categories that involve interface with the government such as paying taxes, construction permits, etc.
Analysts say the new government has taken up the challenge seriously. In a report published last week, global brokerage Nomura said the Modi government has made "commendable progress" in improving the ease of doing business in India.
"There has been a move towards faster processes and less regulation... and the government is considering an amendment to labour laws," said Nomura's Sonal Varma.
The positive sentiment was today echoed by World Bank officials too. To a question whether India will be able to climb the rankings quickly, Augusto Lopez-Claros said, "There is no reason, why not? There are many examples of countries who through focused efforts, through intelligently designed reforms have managed to make very substantial improvement."
If India is able to improve its credentials as a business-friendly destination, it will be able to attract the much-needed foreign direct investment, which according to Deutsche Bank has averaged less than 2 per cent of GDP over the past decade.
An improvement in ease of doing business will also ensure "a better regulatory framework for development, job creation and growth," said Kaushik Basu, chief economist of the World Bank.

Economists  pvt sector executivesmay bag top posts in govt companiesEconomists, pvt sector officials may bag top posts in govt companies
Anupama Airy , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 29, 2014

Private sector executives, technocrats and top economists may soon find their way to coveted slots in public sector units and government departments.
Official sources said a new policy is being framed by the Department of Personnel & Training (DoPT) following instructions from the PMO to rope in professionals and private sector heavyweights with sound managerial experience in government-run institutions and offices including crucial economic and technology-focused ministries.
“While bringing in experience, the move is also aimed at reducing corruption,” the official said.
In a recent interview to HT, Piyush Goyal, minister of power, coal and renewable energy,  had voiced similar intentions of widening the selection criteria to get professionals and management gurus from the private sector.
Sectoral expertise may not be considered as the only criteria for such appointments. “There is no need to have a mining expert as the chairman of Coal India... rather a person with managerial skills and a decent knowledge of mining could prove to be a best fit for the post,” another senior government official said.
It is not an unusual practice to hire corporate heavyweights and even the guidelines of Public Enterprises Selection Board, government’s head-hunter, do not prohibit private individuals from applying for posts in central PSUs.
Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani (as head of the the Unique Identification Authority of India), former Boston Consulting Group chairman Arun Maira (as a member in the Plan panel) and former BSES MD RV Shahi (as union power secretary) are cases in point. All three, however, had relinquished their corporate roles before coming joining government organisations.
IMF economist Raghuram Rajan joined as governor of Reserve Bank of India, a post long dominated by former IAS officers.
NTPC CMD Arup Roy Choudhury welcomed such a move. “Countries like the US follow a similar practice... specialists and experts should be inducted and this will add a lot of value and credibility to the functioning of the government in a fair and transparent manner,” he said.

Fadnavis first team may be bigger than earlier plannedFadnavis’ first team may be bigger than earlier planned

After a tiring day, a constant flow of party legislators kept the chief minister-elect Devendra Fadnavis busy till the wee hours of Wednesday. Each legislator, who is not part of the state core team, wanted a berth in his team.
Fadnavis did not disappoint his MLAs. He told them that he would take their case up with the party bosses, who would ultimately decide his team and departments to be allocated. Barring first-time MLAs, all others are eying a job in his council of ministers which will take oath on October 31.
The lobbying was even more hectic as the party indicated that the first team would be very compact as per its policy of ‘minimum government, maximum governance’.  But with increasing pressure for balancing the socio-political equations, the first team is expected to have more than 10 ministers. Earlier, it was decided to have only seven members – including the CM and four other core team members and one MLA each from the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes.
According to sources, Fadnavis is expected to keep the home, and finance departments and merge many departments for giving out to his ministers. The same formula is in place in New Delhi and Gujarat.
The BJP’s headache has increased further after four small allies, Swabhimani Paksha, Rshtriya Samaj Paksha, the Republican Party and Shiv Sangram has demanded a couple of berths each.
Eknath Khadse, who aspired to be the CM, was offered post of Speaker, but he rejected the offer. He has been assured the revenue and forests departments, said BJP insiders. After Khadse’s refusal, the other veterans Haribhau Jawle or Haribhau Bagde are being considered for the job. Jawle and Bagde are also lobbying for the ministerial job.
Pankaja Munde, the party’s OBC face, is expected to get the social justice department.
The Shiv Sena, which is willing to join the BJP-led government, has also asked for the Speaker’s post in exchange of the support. The BJP is unwilling to oblige the ex-ally. The final decision on both posts would be declared in the interim session of the legislature to be held between October 4 and 6.

Stressed and dissatisfied in aspiring Indiaprint
Sort through the noise and fury that characterise modern Indian politics and three things emerge.
First, the Congress-led UPA government was a bastion of old-style, slow-moving government. Many of its constituents were either corrupt or condoned corruption — for whatever reason: Patronage, personal profit or the cost of coalition.
Second, as recently available statistics reveal, the UPA got some things right.
Stubbornly high levels of malnutrition fell, fewer mothers died, more Indians climbed out of poverty than ever before and fewer went to bed hungry. But the government could not deliver what these millions with improving lives wanted — education and jobs to meet soaring aspirations. The first half of its 10-year reign witnessed unprecedented economic growth, which tailed off during a scandal- and hubris-ridden second term.
Third, Narendra Modi swiftly disrupted India’s politics-as-usual model. The new prime minister’s ideas, whether his own or borrowed from the UPA and outfitted afresh, show purpose and determination. These include launching legal and labour reforms, drives to clean up India and grow manufacturing, freeing diesel from price controls, giving bank accounts to all Indians, cutting subsidies and making them more efficient by revving up Aadhaar, the unique identification system conceived — and crippled — by the UPA. While you can question some of these moves (emasculating environmental laws and discarding some subsidies) and debate the impatience over implementation (even the RBI governor warns against the dangers of a universal banking drive on steroids), you cannot but admit these are ideas whose time is past due.
Now that India has a government that appears responsive to emerging India’s aspirations, is clear-headed in its actions — including a disturbing tendency to quietly encourage its extremist fringes and marginalise minorities — and marking out the roads ahead, it could be time to debate some destinations. It is pertinent to note that despite the vast gulf in personality, popularity and style, Manmohan Singh and Modi share many similar economic views, in particular a free-market, top-down, a rising-tide-floats-all-boats approach to development.
This view translates into a model that urges a more literate and urbanised nation, made that way by rural-to-urban migration, factories and dams, a model that measures hard indices of progress. The soft indices of progress include health, nutrition, quality of education, pollution and female emancipation (the last mentioned is getting particular attention from Modi).
Merging the two models will, ideally, measure a nation’s overall well-being. That is not the case in India (or in the nation India envies, China). From Nehru to Modi, the Indian establishment has always prioritised the hard indices. In many ways, this is not hard to understand. The argument: India has always been so far behind with the basics — electricity, roads and jobs — that it has rarely had the luxury of looking beyond.
There are now strong indications that what lies beyond might not be as appealing as we think. Millions who have moved up the economic scale will contend that their life is better than ever —  and they would be right. But there are no indices, hard or soft, to explain why those who believe they have made it, often, cannot shake the feeling that life is more stressful and dissatisfactory than ever.
A strong indication of the perils of the Indian path to success comes from lush Kerala, the state that preceded Gujarat as a model of development. As my colleague Jyothi Shankaran recently reported, quoting government health statistics, other things remaining the same, by 2025, Malayalee men will live to 75 years and women to 79 (the general Indian estimate is 70 and 72), a consequence possibly of spending more on health per capita than any other state. Kerala is also now India’s most urbanised state, with nearly 48% of the population living in towns and cities, up from 27% in 2001.
But weigh these measures of progress against softer indices and you may begin to understand why Kerala is more stressed than ever. The men in God’s Own Country have a blood-sugar measure that is four times the national average and India’s highest. Once a nation of wiry, fit people, Kerala leads the way in sedentary living and physical inactivity. Alcohol consumption and suicide rates are soaring and spending inequity is the nation’s highest.
Could this be India’s future? Some answers are available in prosperous communities and their islands of affluence across the nation. Similar reports have emerged — of soaring cancer and cardiac-disease rates, linked to changed lifestyles and other still-indeterminate links to polluted air, water, food, even ever-chaotic traffic.    
India now has a suicide rate that is among the world’s highest, according to a new WHO database. Many more people kill themselves in the more prosperous and urbanised southern states and, since 2012, more non-farmers have been committing suicide than farmers, suggesting mounting stress may accompany a better life for Indians.
Little wonder, a vague feeling of stress, ill-being and impatience appears to be spreading among Indians; perhaps, these feelings emerge in the form of ever-rising political expectations. After the UPA’s blunder-filled reign, which refused to adequately even address these expectations, Modi’s direct conversation about aspirations generates an almost euphoric voter response.
India is at an inflection point. Never has there been a greater yearning for progress. There is abundant talent, money and, possibly, political support for change. But it is imperative to carefully consider the kind of change unfolding to assess the hard indices against the soft. With the Planning Commission gone, it might not be a bad idea to consider a Commission for National Well-Being, which could study links between the government’s priorities — many on the right track — and others that should be.
For instance, reform of India’s vast, ramshackle health infrastructure is not among the government’s priorities. It should be — along with dodgy pollution-control and crumbling environmental protection processes. Few nations have progressed on the hard indices alone. Consider war-ravaged — and now fast-growing — Cambodia: In 1990, the maternal mortality rate (MMR) — a measure of the mothers who die per 100,000 live births —was 1,200, three times higher than India’s 560. By 2013, India’s MMR was down to 190, according to the WHO. Cambodia’s had dropped to 170.

Tech Mahindra Posts Profit of Rs 720 Crore in Q2

Aviation Regulator Acts Tough Against Troubled SpiceJet: Report
Mumbai: Notwithstanding a healthy rise in revenue, Tech Mahindra on Wednesday reported a marginal growth in September quarter net profit at Rs 719.7 crore as foreign exchange losses impacted the bottom line.
The Mahindra Group company had reported a net post-tax profit of Rs 718.4 crore in the year ago period.
Chief financial officer Milind Kulkarni said there was an amortisation gain in the year-ago quarter through a large deal signed in FY08 that used to result in a gain of $9 million till last year, which is over now, impacting the bottom line growth.
Also, there was a Rs 45.8 crore loss on the forex side, he said, adding that with high volatility in the rupee, the company changed its hedging strategy recently under which it reduced its duration of the protection to two years from the earlier five years.
The revenue rose 15 per cent to Rs 5,488 crore over the same period last fiscal year while on a sequential basis it rose 7.2 per cent. The profit was up 14.1 per cent on a sequential basis.
Its pre-tax margins also improved to 19.9 per cent during the quarter as against the preceding June quarter's 18.1 per cent.
Executive vice chairman Vineet Nayyar said the company believes in long-term contracts and the movement of the performance may vary according to the time period.
He said early on, the company is in the investment phase which impacts the margins but once the work is on stream, the returns are higher.
During the reporting quarter, it experienced an increase in attrition at 18 per cent against 16 per cent in the quarter-ago period.
It added three large clients during the quarter, while the total number of client additions stood at 17, taking the total number of active clients to 649.
Managing director and chief executive C P Gurnani said the telecom sector led among the sectors on the revenue front with 8 per cent growth on a sequential basis, followed by manufacturing at 4.7 per cent and retail at 4.6 per cent.
The Americas market led with a 10.2 per cent growth in revenue while Europe was up 5.6 per cent, he said, adding that there was de-growth in the rest of the world market.
Contrary to the optimism of its larger rival Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Mr Gurnani said the domestic opportunity, even with initiatives like 'Digital India' by the new government, does not excite the company.
On future deals, he said the situation is much better than the year-ago period, with opportunities in the retail, manufacturing, BFSI and life sciences sectors.
However, it may take time for the deals to fructify due to the upcoming holiday season, he said.
Shares in Tech Mahindra, on Wednesday, ended at Rs 2,396.50 apiece on the BSE, up 1.16 per cent from the previous close.

Tokyo Stocks Open Higher as Dollar Gains Against Yen
AFP | Updated On: October 30, 2014 07:35 (IST)
Tokyo stocks opened 0.27 per cent higher on Thursday after the dollar jumped against the yen on a slight bullish turn by the US Federal Reserve.
The Nikkei 225 index at the Tokyo Stock Exchange gained 42.59 points to 15,596.50 at the start.
Shares in Nintendo soared 7.33 per cent to 11,935.0 yen in the first few minutes of trade after the videogame giant announced its first-half net profit jumped as a sharply weaker yen boosted its bottom line.
On Wednesday the US Fed, after a two-day meeting, made no unexpected policy changes, announcing the wind-up of its quantitative easing stimulus programme while keeping in place plans to maintain ultra-low interest rates well into 2015.
But a shift to a more optimistic assessment of the labour market, after having shown doubts about gains all year, showed a "hawkish" turn by policymakers of the Federal Open Market committee, analysts said, bolstering the dollar.
The greenback was at 108.84 yen early Thursday, slightly down from 108.90 yen in New York Wednesday afternoon but sharply up from 108.12 yen in Tokyo earlier Wednesday.
The euro bought $1.2637 and 137.47 yen against $1.2634 and 137.60 yen in US trade.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.18 per cent.

Oil India Seeks More Hydrocarbon Concessions
Press Trust of India | Updated On: October 29, 2014 13:58 (IST)
Aviation Regulator Acts Tough Against Troubled SpiceJet: Report
Singapore: India's second largest public sector company Oil India Limited (OIL) is seeking more hydrocarbon concessions across the globe, including in Brazil and Mexico.
"We are aggressively looking for a lot of good property from where we can bring crude oil into India," Sunil Kumar Srivastava, chairman and managing director (CMD) of OIL, told PTI on Tuesday.
"The government of India is very supportive of our overseas ventures. They are encouraging us to go global to help reduce energy import volumes," he said.
"The more oil and gas we bring into the country, it would help reduce the country's energy import bill," he said on the sideline of the Singapore International Energy Week.
India imports about 75 per cent of its crude oil and 30 per cent of its natural gas requirements a year.
Among its major ventures abroad, OIL has invested $900 million on four per cent farm-in stake in offshore Mozambique.
OIL and ONGC Videsh Limited (OVL) had announced a 10 per cent farm-in acquisition with Mozambique in January this year.
The company operates in 11 overseas countries and produces small quantities of hydrocarbon in the United States, Venezuela and Russia.

United Spirits Has Huge Opportunity to Grow in India: Motilal Oswal
India's blue chip Nifty index has stayed in a narrow zone after touching an all-time high of 8,180.20 on September 8. Many analysts say markets are due for a sharp correction before the next up move begins. Some like Ambit Investment Advisory's boss Andrew Holland continue to be bullish and expect the Nifty to hit 8,500 before Budget.
"We will probably have a clear run now getting past 8,500 on the Nifty between now and Budget," he said. ( Watch full interview )
According to Mr Holland, the last 400-500 points up move on the Nifty was driven by global liquidity, but further rally will be driven by fundamentals.
Mr Holland's conviction in equities has been strengthened by the announcement of recent reform measures in the oil and gas sector. The government had earlier this month decontrolled diesel prices and hiked domestic gas prices. It also said that the coal sector will be opened up for private companies.
Mr Holland also sounded bullish about India's defence sector, where the government last week cleared equipment purchases worth of Rs 80,000 crore.
"I think global companies will tie up with Indian companies to set up manufacturing facilities for defence equipment in India," he said.
Ambit's stock and sector recommendations
1)Auto/auto components: The auto sector will continue to do well, but auto component suppliers will outperform.
Top pick: Ramkrishna Forgings, which supplies spare parts to commercial vehicles, is a good bet. The company is likely to benefit from operational gearing as its capacity utilisation is likely increase over next six to nine months.
Ambit is also bullish on Bajaj Auto in the auto sector.
2) Power and railways: These two sectors will attract huge investment in the near future. Companies like Alstom T&D India will be a clear winner in the sector as its technology is superior to its competitors. Alstom's profit will more than triple over a period of 2-3 years.
3) Private banks: RBI may act soon on rate cut, which will benefit private lenders the most.

Moody s Says Negative on Indian Banks as Corporate Leverage HighIndian Realty Market Sees $4.5 Billion Investment During January-September: CBRE
Mumbai: High leverage in the Indian corporate sector could prevent any meaningful recovery in asset quality at lenders over the next 12-18 months, Moody's Investors Service said on Wednesday, maintaining its "negative" outlook on the country's banking sector.
Moody's estimated India's corporate sector had an average debt-to-equity ratio of more than 3 times, and would need a stronger economic recovery than currently projected by the credit agency to bring down the leverage.
"Poor asset quality will require continued provisioning and strengthened capital buffers," Moody's said.
The agency said its "negative" outlook pertained mainly to state-owned lenders that account for more than 70 per cent of banking assets.
Non-performing loans were at a three-year high, although new bad loans have peaked, Moody's said.
Industry data has shown bad loans comprise around 4 per cent of banking assets, while stressed loans, which include restructured loans, account for nearly 10 per cent.

Going by medical evidenceUpdated: October 29, 2014 01:12 IST
Going by medical evidence
health
The reaction of the Governors of New York and New Jersey to the Ebola threat reflects their lack of understanding of the nature of the disease, and utter disregard for the need to institute well-thought-out public health policies that are based on sound medical advice and clear evidence. In a knee-jerk reaction, both the Governors on October 24 made it mandatory to quarantine for 21 days even asymptomatic people returning from the three Ebola-stricken West African countries if they had come in direct contact with people suffering from Ebola. Illinois soon followed suit. As a result, an American nurse returning from Sierra Leone was placed under quarantine. The policy was hurriedly introduced after Craig Spencer, a New York-based doctor who had treated patients in Guinea, tested positive for Ebola. Facing a barrage of criticism and an uproar, the Governors revised the policy in less than 72 hours to allow asymptomatic people to be quarantined at home for 21 days with twice-daily monitoring; those being monitored will be allowed to interact with family and friends. Despite the revision, the policy remains more restrictive than the requirements put out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Beginning October 27, the CDC’s updated guidance requires direct and active monitoring by public health officials once a day along with follow-up monitoring over phone for a period of 21 days for all travellers returning from the three disease-hit countries. It also calls for restricted public activities and restricted long-distance travel, but there is not a word on quarantining asymptomatic persons.
Unlike airborne diseases such as flu and tuberculosis, people can get infected by the virus only when they come in direct contact with the body fluids of an Ebola patient. Infected people remain free of symptoms and do not transmit the virus during the incubation period of two to 21 days. It is obvious that the panic-stricken Governors went overboard with their policy that had no scientific basis whatsoever. The direct fallout of their irrational policy would have led to a further reduction in the number of health workers volunteering to tackle the outbreak in the three African countries. Already the number of health workers volunteering to work in these countries is disproportionately small compared with the magnitude of the problem. While monitoring must be a top priority, allaying the fears of people by creating more awareness should be given equal importance. The U.S. has much to learn from the way Nigeria handled the Ebola situation and rid itself of the disease recently. A massive awareness programme along with tracking and surveillance was the way Nigeria tackled the situation.

Sebi Notifies New Norms For Employee Stock Options
Press Trust of India | Updated On: October 29, 2014 21:04 (IST)
IVRCL Allots First Tranche of Shares to CDR Lenders
Market regulator Sebi or Securities and Exchange Board of India has notified new ESOP or employee stock options regulations, including for purchase of shares by employee welfare trusts from the secondary market with adequate safeguards.
Sebi has allowed companies to have employee stock option programmes where they can buy their own company shares subject to certain conditions.
Employee stock options are a practice followed world over and the market regulator has outlined certain safeguards to improve the governance and transparency of the schemes and also address concerns regarding potential market abuse.
Generally, in India, some companies count it (shares held by ESOP Trusts) in the promoter category and some companies count it in the public category.
Some of the safeguards as outlined by the regulator include requirement of shareholders' approval through special resolution for undertaking secondary market acquisitions; restrictions on sale of shares by trusts; at least six month holding period for shares acquired from secondary market.
Other safeguards include stricter disclosure and other regulatory obligations; a limit of 10 per cent of the assets held by general employee benefit schemes other than ESOS type of schemes and certain limits on secondary market acquisitions.
To ensure a smooth transition for complying with the new regulatory framework, the existing employee benefit schemes have been provided with a time period of one year from the date of notification.
Further a longer transition period of five years has been provided for re-classifying shareholding of existing employee benefit schemes separately from 'promoter' and 'public' category.
Bringing down the level of shares acquired from secondary market within the permissible limits and reducing own share component to 10 per cent of the total assets of general employee benefit schemes.
In a notification, Sebi said, "the trust shall be required to hold the shares acquired through secondary acquisition for a minimum period of six months."
"Secondary acquisition in a financial year by the trust shall not exceed two per cent of the paid up equity capital as at the end of the previous financial year," it added.
The regulator said option, SAR (stock appreciation right) or any other benefit granted to an employee under the regulations should not be transferable to any person.
Sebi said a company would have to constitute a compensation committee for administration and superintendence of the schemes. .
In case new issue of shares is made under any scheme, shares so issued would be required to be listed immediately in any stock exchange where the existing shares are listed.
The shares arising after the initial public offering (IPO) of an unlisted company, out of options or SAR granted under any scheme prior to its IPO to the employees would have be listed immediately upon exercise in all the recognised stock exchanges.
Sebi said the employee should not have right to receive any dividend or to vote or in any manner enjoy the benefits of a shareholder in respect of option granted to him, till shares are issued upon exercise of option.
"The amount payable by the employee, if any, at the time of grant of option, -may be forfeited by the company if the option is not exercised by the employee within the exercise period; or may be refunded to the employee if the options are not vested due to non-fulfilment of conditions relating to vesting of option as per the ESOS," it added.

After NSEL Scam, Government Withdraws Waiver Given to Spot Bourses
Press Trust of India | Updated On: October 29, 2014 22:38 (IST)
New Delhi: Wiser after the Rs 5,600-crore scam at National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL), the government on Wednesday withdrew exemption granted to all spot commodity bourses for launching one-day forward contracts in agri and non-agri items with immediate effect.
In August 2013, the payment scam surfaced at NSEL after it was found violating the exemption.
Through a gazette notification dated September 19, the Finance Ministry on Wednesday said the waiver granted to three national spot exchanges - NSEL, NCDEX Spot Exchange (NSPOT) and National Agriculture Produce Marketing Company of India Ltd (National APMC) - has been withdrawn with immediate effect.
"Having examined the activities of such entities and on the basis of the experience gained, the central government is of the view that such entities which were granted exemption under section 27 of the said Act, thereby facilitating unregulated forward trading on their platform, have failed to serve the purpose for which they were created," it said.
In view of various risks associated with trading in such unregulated entities, forward trading in such unregulated entities is not in public interest, it added.
The exemption was utilised only by NSEL, while the other two exchanges never used it. So the withdrawal of the exemption may not have impact on any exchange, a senior Finance Ministry official said.
In 2007, the government had exempted one-day forward contracts offered by spot exchanges from the purview of the Forward Contracts Regulation Act (FCRA).
The waiver was given with a condition that the exchanges would not permit short sales - selling a commodity without owning it - and ensure that all outstanding positions at the end of the day resulted in delivery.
While Financial Technologies India Ltd or FTIL-promoted NSEL was granted exemption on June 5, 2007, NSPOT and National APMC received exemptions under the same provisions on July 23, 2008 and August 11, 2010 respectively.

Sensex Edges Higher, Nifty Rises Above 8,100

IVRCL Allots First Tranche of Shares to CDR Lenders
BSE Sensex and Nifty were higher today but the gains were capped after the US central bank ended its historic stimulus programme in a move widely expected.
Asian stocks were mixed and the dollar surged to a three-week high versus the yen after the US Federal Reserve ended its massive quantitative easing programme, as expected, but laced its economic assessment with a tinge of optimism.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.6 per cent. In a statement on Wednesday after a two-day meeting, the Fed ended its quantitative easing programme of bond purchases. At its peak, the programme pumped $85 billion a month into the financial system.
The Fed did retain its basic guidance that overnight borrowing costs would remain near zero for a "considerable time".
But it dropped the characterisation of the US labour market slack as "significant" in a show of confidence in the economy's prospects, the part markets perceived as containing a slightly hawkish bent by spelling a turn towards a new regime. (With Agency Inputs)

NRI Investors Versus ICICI Venture: Sebi Probe SoughtAviation Regulator Acts Tough Against Troubled SpiceJet: Report
Mumbai: After moving the Mauritius Supreme Court seeking $103 million in damages from private equity fund ICICI Venture, a group of around 80 NRI investors have sought a probe from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) in the matter.
In a 26-page complaint sent to the Sebi on October 16, the investors alleged that two realty-focused funds from ICICI Venture-the Dynamic India Fund III & IV- have taken money from them promising returns to the tune of 25 per cent.
However, none of the 13 projects in which their money was invested are completed well after the committed nine-year gestation period, the complaint said.
The investors want the Sebi to probe the allegations of misrepresentations, concealment and omission of material facts, misleading statements, negligence, and breaches of duty towards the investors by not exercising care and due diligence while managing their investments, as they claim that these misconducts have diminished the value of their investment considerably.
When contacted, a Dubai-based investor Gulab Patil, who has been authorised by around 500 investors with a power of attorney, told PTI that he has filed the complaint with Sebi on October 16.
Mr Patil, who hails from Pune, said that he had invested $2.5 lakh in 2005 when these two funds were launched.
The complaint by 78 investors, mainly NRIs and persons of Indian origin, urged Sebi to probe against ICICI Venture Funds Management Company (ICICI Venture), ICICI Bank, Dynamic India Fund III & IV (DIF III & IV), India Advantage Fund III & IV (IAF III & IV), under the provisions of the Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to securities markets) Regulations 2003 of Sebi.
ICICI Venture has already denied all the charges as "totally baseless and malicious".
ICICI Venture also countered the claim of damages, saying the aggrieved investors accounted for a small percentage of those invested in the fund and they had refused to take a 'cash exit option' although returns were never guaranteed.
"The allegations levelled by a set of investors, constituting only 12 per cent of the investors in the said fund, are totally baseless, not supported by facts and are malicious," an ICICI Venture spokesperson had said.
DIF III &IV schemes, registered in Mauritius, are structured as feeder-funds by ICICI Venture and are registered with the Sebi as foreign venture capital investors.
The fund was promoted to be a close-ended fund with a corpus of $220 million. The fund was aimed at developing, leasing, owning and selling quality office and residential properties and retail spaces.

Realty Stocks Jump on FDI Relaxation; Orbit, Sobha Lead
NDTV | Updated On: October 30, 2014 16:25 (IST)
IVRCL Allots First Tranche of Shares to CDR Lenders
Shares in realty and construction companies jumped on Thursday, a day after the government relaxed rules for foreign direct investment in construction development. The new rules make it easier for foreign companies to invest in India and many projects will now qualify for FDI through automatic route (no FIPB clearance will be required), analysts say.
The government wants to open up the construction sector to attract investments so that it can deliver on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's promise to create 100 "smart cities" in India by 2020.
Wednesday's announcement is a big positive for realty and construction companies too because the new measures will lead to new funding sources. The realty sub-index on the BSE surged 2 per cent in early trade outperforming the broader Sensex that traded flat.
Here's what the government has done,
1) The government has reduced the minimum requirements for built areas for FDI. Under the new rules, the minimum built area for projects in which foreign investment is allowed will be reduced to 20,000 square metres from 50,000.
2) The minimum capital investment by foreign companies has been cut to $5 million from $10 million.
3) The lock-in period of three years during which the investment cannot be repatriated has been removed. Now, investors will be allowed to expatriate the investment on completion of the project or three years after the final investment is made.
4) The condition that housing projects should provide for 30 per cent affordable housing has been removed.
The new rules will encourage development of smaller projects, especially in urban areas, where the availability of land is limited, said Akash Gupt, executive director at PWC. The risk of delay in smaller projects will be reduced, he added.
JP Morgan says the new measures are good for DLF, Unitech, HDIL, and Prestige Estates. DLF, which is under huge selling pressure for the last one month, rose 5 per cent in trade today.
Among other stocks, Orbit Corp ended 19 per cent higher, while HDIL closed with 6 per cent gains. Hubtown,  Parsvnath Developers, Phoenix Mills, Unitech, Anant Raj and Godrej Properties also closed higher.

Cyclone Nilofar to cross Gujarat coast only on SaturdayCyclone Nilofar to cross Gujarat coast only on Saturday
Vinson Kurian
Source: IMD Satellite image taken on October 28, 2014.
Thiruvananthapuram, Oct 28:  
Very severe cyclone Nilofar is now expected to weaken two rounds and cross the Gujarat coast as a minimal cyclone a day later than expected.
The revised date of landfall is Saturday (November 1), an update by India Meteorological Department said this morning.
WESTERN DISTURBANCE
At 8.30 am, Nilofar was traced to 1,110 km southwest of Naliya (Gujarat) and 1,150 km south-southwest of Karachi in Pakistan.
The location was lately closest to Salalah in Oman (820 km), but Nilofar will sustain its track towards that port city only for the next 12 hours.
Later, as expected, an incoming western disturbance from the opposite direction will prevail on Nilofar to taka an about-turn to northeast towards the Gujarat coast.
The Met has once again upgraded the peak wind speeds associated with the system to 140 to 150 km/hr with gusts of 165 km/hr for two days from today.
WIND SPEEDS, ALERT
Nilofar would still be out in the sea when the acceleration happens, and will start weakening from Thursday.
The wind speed at landfall on Saturday morning would be around 80- to 90 km/hr gusting to 100 km/hr.
Sea condition would be ‘rough’ (8- to 13 m in height) to ‘very rough’ (13- to 20 m) from Friday and ‘high’ (20- to 30 ft) on Saturday.
The Met has warned of isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall for Saurashtra and Kutch districts from Friday night.
Thatched roofs and huts may suffer damage from the storm as it crosses land. Power and communication lines are too expected to suffer in the bargain.

Lt Governor Najeeb Jung to invite BJP to form govt in Delhi soon

NEW DELHI: Lt Governor Najeeb Jung is likely to send an invite in the next couple of days to BJP, the single-largest party in the Delhi Assembly to form government in the national capital.
Sources said that as President Pranab Mukherjee has given his clearance, an invite would now be sent to the BJP.
The Centre today told the Supreme Court that President Pranab Mukherjee has given his consent to Jung's proposal to invite BJP to form the government in the national capital.
Jung last month had sent a report to the President seeking permission to invite BJP to form government in Delhi.
In the report, Jung gave a detailed analysis of the political situation and underlined the need to have an elected government in the city which is under President's Rule since February 17 following resignation of the Aam Aadmi Party government after being in power for 49 days.
The Election Commission on Saturday had announced bypoll to three Assembly constituencies on November 25 but if the Lt Governor dissolves the Assembly then the bypolls will not take place.
The BJP has been maintaining that it will take a decision on government formation in Delhi after getting an invite from the Lt Governor.
Currently, BJP, along with ally Akali Dal's lone MLA, has 29 legislators and will require the support of five more MLAs to prove majority in the Assembly.
The government led by Arvind Kejriwal had resigned on 14 February after the party's pet project, the Jan Lokpal Bill , could not be passed due to opposition from BJP and Congress.
President's Rule was imposed in Delhi on February 17. The Lt Governor had not favoured dissolution of the Delhi Assembly as recommended by the council of ministers headed by Kejriwal and kept the Assembly in suspended animation.
Congress and Aam Aadmi Party have been demanding immediate dissolution of the Assembly to pave way for holding of fresh elections.

Crude oil rises after 2-day loss; US inventories seen up againCrude oil rises after 2-day loss; US inventories seen up again

Crude oil prices closed higher on Tuesday, with Brent finishing just above $86 a barrel after two straight days of losses, helped by a weaker dollar.
ET SPECIAL:
NEW YORK: Crude oil prices closed higher on Tuesday, with Brent finishing just above $86 a barrel after two straight days of losses, helped by a weaker dollar and a rally on Wall Street.
But worries about a third weekly build in a row in US crude inventories capped gains.
Crude stockpiles in the United States were forecast to have risen 3.4 million barrels in the week to Oct. 24, while inventories of distillates and gasoline were seen lower, according to a Reuters survey.
Industry group American Petroleum Institute will issue its inventory report for the week at 4.30 p.m. EDT (2030 GMT). The US government's Energy Information Administration will release on Wednesday its own official data for the same period.
Oil rode the coattails of US stocks which surged late in Tuesday's session as better-than-expected earnings eased worries about the outlook for corporate America.
"We were treading water through the day, until we latched on in the afternoon to the stockmarket run-up," said Phillip Streible, senior market strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago, Illinois. "To me, this isn't a convincing rebound for oil, and I expect the market to reverse course by tomorrow."
Brent for December delivery settled up 20 cents at $86.03 a barrel.
US crude finished up 42 cents at $81.42 a barrel, after hitting a more than two-year low of $79.44 on Monday.
The dollar was down as much as 0.3 per cent against a basket of major currencies, after mixed US data that showed disappointing domestic home prices and durable goods orders and the highest level of consumer confidence in seven years.
Oil prices fell about 1 per cent over past two sessions, reacting to a looming contango in US crude futures and Goldman Sachs' cut in its price forecast due to higher projected supplies.
Fears of growing US oil shale supply and OPEC's apparent reluctance to cut its own output have caused prices to fall about 25 per cent since the end of June.
While most banks have lower price forecasts next year for Brent and US crude, some analysts think the markets may rebound quicker than projected.
Barclays on Tuesday revised its Brent forecast for the first quarter of 2015 to $88 a barrel, down from $95, and US crude to $78 from $87.
But its London-based commodities research head, Kevin Norrish, said a steadying forward price spread and seasonal demand could aid Brent's recovery.
China's industrial profits slipped in the first nine months, data showed, reinforcing signs of a slowdown in the No. 1 oil importer.
But Virendra Chauhan, analyst at Energy Aspects, told the Reuters Global Oil Forum that China's gasoline demand in September rose by 500,000 barrels per day from the previous year, in spite of the slowing economy.

(Talks on Japanese telecom…)
BANGALORE | NEW DELHI: Talks on Japanese telecom major SoftBank's proposal to invest in New Delhi-based mobile commerce company Paytm have hit a setback over valuation.
SoftBank's offer was lower than the $1 billion valuation Paytm expected, sources told ET. Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the founder of One97, which owns Paytm said the deal is not off the table. SoftBank didn't immediately respond to queries from ET seeking comment.
"The discussion is on. It hasn't been officially decided either way," Sharma said, declining to comment on specifics. Paytm is also in talks with Google Capital, ET had reported earlier.
"We're seeing a lot of interest from other investors, including pure financial investors as well," Sharma added. The company has set an internal deadline of November 3 for receiving proposals and may take a call on final valuation early next month.
SoftBank had offered to invest up to $300 million in Paytm for a significant minority share in the company. ET couldn't ascertain the valuation at which the offer was made.
Besides the promoter's holding in Paytm, SAIF Partners owns 40%. Silicon Valley Bank, SAP Ventures, Intel Capital and Reliance Capital also own equity in the company. Paytm mandated Citigroup and Goldman Sachs to raise private equity capital of $150-200 million. The mobile commerce company plans to use the funds to improve technology, logistics and its headcount.
Earlier on Tuesday, SoftBank chief executive officer Masayoshi Son announced a $627 million investment in Delhi-based e-commerce company Snapdeal. The Tokyo-based company was also a major investor in a group that put in $210 million in taxi rental company Olacab.
Paytm claims over 14 million transactions, including mobile recharges, tickets and shopping deals a month. Its annualised transaction value is $400- 500 million.

How changing its biz model helped Snapdeal turn aroundHow changing its business model helped Snapdeal turn around

(The funding from Alibaba-backer Softbank has…)
BANGALORE: Snapdeal's tale is one of pivots, change and uncertainty. This description comes from none other than the company's chief executive Kunal Bahl.
The funding from Alibaba-backer Softbank has proved that Snapdeal is a strong contender to grab the top spot in India's hotly-contested online retail industry.
But it was a different scenario last year. "Last January we were down to our last $100,000 in the bank," said Bahl. The decision to pivot from a daily deals site to a marketplace in 2012, now seen as prescient, and the resultant lack of investor support had brought the fledgling company to its knees. This was not the first business model change for the company. Jasper Infotech, Snapdeal's parent, started out as a multi-channel direct marketing company.
"I didn't realise how adveradverse a reaction I would get from potential investors when they learnt we were a business in transition," said Kunal Bahl , 31, who launched Snapdeal in 2010 with his Delhi Public School friend Rohit Bansal.
This decision, he said, was the biggest professional risk he has taken. By then the company had raised over $50 million from investors like Nexus Venture Partners and Bessemer Venture Partners. "We had to make a decision, shrink our expenses or significantly reduce our team," said Rohit Bansal , 31, an IIT-Delhi graduate. The company decided to stop spending on marketing, an area considered sacrosanct by online retail firms.
The team began saving money every way they could. "Bachate raho" or keep saving is written on the switch boards in Snapdeal's Delhi office to ensure unwanted lights are switched off. "The Snapdeal tagline of 'Bachate Raho' was a result of this experience," said Bahl, who still drives a second-hand Honda Civic.
What did not waver was the belief that the two had in the marketplace model. The decision to pivot was arrived at by Bahl and Bansal on a street in Beijing in late-2011, during their first visit to China."We were meeting ecommerce companies there and realised these companies were launching rockets and we wanted to launch those rockets in India," said Bahl.
Such quick decision-making is characteristic of the duo, said Suvir Sujan, managing director of Snadeal's early investor Nexus Venture Partners. "They are fast in everything they do... When they pivoted the business from offline coupons to launch Snapdeal, it was done in a weekend," said Sujan.
The turnaround came in mid-2013, when US-based online marketplace eBay decided to back the company. "It added the necessary validation and credibility to our business," said Bahl. In August that year, eBay, Recruit Holdings, Intel Capital, ru-Net, Saama Capital and existing investors pumped in $50 million.
After that there was no looking back. Today, the company has over 50,000 merchants on its platform, has crossed sales of $1 billion and raised almost $1 billion in risk capital this year. It also roped in former chairman of Tata Group, Ratan Tata, as an investor.
"The transformation has been amazing. No one expected Snapdeal to come and challenge Flipkart," said Saurabh Srivastava, director at advisory firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) India. With annual growth rates of 600%, scaling up is no longer the only motivator.
"The hyper growth will no longer be the only motivation; it will be the new normal," said Bahl. "Our purpose is to create life changing experiences for our merchants. We can keep doing that for the next 25 years."

PM Modis reforms: Half-hearted or clever gradualismSorry, but these reforms are plainly half-hearted. Some may even call them chicken-hearted. Modi is a great salesman, getting a lot of mileage out of minor measures and halfmeasures. But, clearly, he is avoiding radical reform.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
Policy changes after the Maharashtra elections have sent animal spirits and stock markets soaring. Diesel has been decontrolled. The price of natural gas has been revised to $5.61, with a proviso to revise it every six months. Coal blocks deallocated by the Supreme Court are going to be auctioned soon. Earlier, there were some changes in labour laws and the 'inspector raj'. Optimists gushed about a new reform era.
Sorry, but these reforms are plainly half-hearted. Some may even call them chicken-hearted. Modi is a great salesman, getting a lot of mileage out of minor measures and halfmeasures. But, clearly, he is avoiding radical reform.
That leaves two possibilities. First, that he is by instinct a half-hearted liberaliser, and seeks fast growth through better administration rather than policy reform. After all, he produced rapid growth in Gujarat under the UPA's overall policies.
Glacial, But Impactful
The second possibility is that Modi does, indeed, have substantial reforms in mind, but believes in gradualism. Radical change may yield large gains, but it also creates immediate losers who can organise strong protests. Gradual change produces fewer short-term gains but also fewer losers, and so, does not stoke protests.
The classic demonstration of this was the raising of diesel prices by 50 paise per litre per month — too small to stoke protests, yet, it meant a substantial Rs 6 rise in price over a year. This policy was initiated by the UPA but followed by Modi. He may have the same approach in mind for other areas urgently requiring reform.
Hesitant First Steps
Take a close look at his reforms so far. He made only marginal changes to the UPA's interim railway budget and Union Budget, and cancelled the UPA proposal for raising suburban rail fares. True, he appointed a railway reforms committee. But many such railway committee reports in the past yielded zilch. The Jan Dhan Yojana and Swachh Bharat Abhiyan are continuations of UPA policies.
The deregulation of diesel is a major change, but it mainly represents Modi's luck in the steep fall in global prices. That has made possible deregulation. But diesel was deregulated by the Vajpayee government too, and controls came back when international prices rose. It remains to be seen whether Modi will act differently.
The Supreme Court's striking down of captive coal blocks provided a perfect opening for denationalising coal. Yet, the government has funked doing that, though it retains the option to denationalise later. Do we need another Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report to tell us that open bidding after denationalisation will produce much higher bids than captive auctions?
The price of natural gas should have been decontrolled. Instead, a new formula has been announced that retains price control, and violates the conditions in contracts promising a free market price. The Kelkar Committee's recommendation — let gas go to the highest bidders — has been rejected. Violating contracts is hardly the good governance Modi talks of, and will inhibit bidding for new exploration contracts that petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan hopes to launch.
Columnist Mihir Sharma expresses amusement that "such steps are being sold as great reform, just as a website for inspectors was sold as labour law reform and an electronic attendance register for bureaucrats as administrative reform". India still has 44 central laws and maybe 100 state laws on labour, and Modi needs to consolidate and scrap most of these. No sign of that, though.

NEW DELHI: The Centre is set to roll out a clutch of power reforms over the next few months including measures to fulfil the ruling BJP's commitment to provide uninterrupted electricity supply in cooperation with state governments.
After dealing with the crucial ordinance for coal block e-auction, the government will start dealing with other long-pending issues to boost power sector, officials said, adding that power minister Piyush Goyal will start launching programmes for which the government has made budgetary allocations.
"Power ministry has availed most of the approvals from government departments concerned for strengthening transmission and distribution networks, separating feeders for agriculture and households in rural areas and promoting ultra mega solar power projects in four states. It is time for Goyal to bring state governments on board to engage them in Centre's initiatives," a power ministry official said.
The official, who did not wish to be named, added that the power ministry will start rolling out various initiatives within a month or two while work is also in progress for reforms in Electricity Act 2003.
The government has sought stakeholders' feedback for the proposed amendments in Electricity Act by mid-November, ahead of the winter session of Parliament. "Fuel supply was one of the most crucial challenges that the power sector was facing.
The government has come up with a road map for e-auction of coal blocks and price pooling for fuels to ensure adequate coal and natural gas supplies for the power plants. While fuel supplies will improve gradually, it is time for the government to reduce commercial losses in the areas of electricity transmission and distribution," said the official.
Finance minister Arun Jaitley had in July allocated Rs500 crore each for Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana and ultra mega solar power projects besides Rs200 crore for strengthening Delhi's transmission network, among other programmes.
Goyal, who was busy campaigning for Maharashtra assembly polls, will shortly initiate dialogues with various state governments to ensure "power for all", officials said. Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Delhi have already come on board for the programme while Goyal wants to cover as many states a possible before the next Union Budget, an official said.
Under the initiative, the Centre will provide financial assistance to improve power generation and strengthen transmission and distribution network besides funding energy saving systems.

Modi s golden opportunity to launch a Make in India digital economyThe truth is that India’s Baidu is Google, India’s TenCent is Facebook, and India’s Alibaba is Flipkart, owned by Tiger Global and Naspers. 
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
In the last month, India has seen something it's never seen before: Leaders of the world's largest technology companies - Jeff Bezos ( Amazon ), Satya Nadella ( Microsoft ), Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook) and Sunder Pichai (a top 3 Google-ite) all visited India in the span of one month. This week Softbank's Masayoshi Son is touring India, and has committed to invest $10 billion into digital India.
And last week a delegation of Indian digital entrepreneurs toured China, meeting companies like Baidu (worth $75 billion), Alibaba (worth $200 billion) and TenCent (worth $140 billion), all home-grown in China. The Chinese digital economy now contributes 4.4% to the Chinese economy, directly employing hundreds of thousands of people, and indirectly giving white-collar jobs to millions more. Digital China is now a major driver of China's growth story.
So when today, more than ever before, global technology companies are eyeing India, the question the Indian government should be asking is: Should the Indian digital economy be ''Make in India'', or ''Expand into India''? We can take a cue from China. China's digital boom story is, at least partially, due to China's interest in incubating domestic digital business growth by limiting access of global majors to the Chinese market. India, conversely, has been an open door for global companies, which has led to Google and Facebook's domi-nance in India (which today capture more than 75% of India's digital advertising pie, despite minimal operations here). Even India's largest digital company, Flipkart , is over 80% foreign owned by investors. The truth is that India's Baidu is Google, India's TenCent is Facebook , and India's Alibaba is Flipkart, owned by Tiger Global and Naspers. And most of that development, except for Flipkart, is being done abroad.
In comparison to China, India's digital revolution is just beginning. If Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants the digital revolution to be an Indian phenomenon and a major driver of India's economic growth story, he should outline measures that enable and encourage domestic digital business growth, including domestic investment incentive schemes and measures that help Indian companies compete with global ones, including potential FDI restrictions. Doing nothing, as has been done thus far, is a passive way of encouraging global companies to earn more globally out of India's growth story, and may be a massive missed opportunity for a key driver of India's growth in the coming decade.

Meet Devendra Fadnavis: The Mr clean of Maha politicsBJP
(Fadnavis became the youngest…)
MUMBAI: A few years ago, in the villages of Vidarbha, the effect of load-shedding was so much that farmers would get electricity only for a few hours at night when they would venture to their fields, risking more than anything, attacks by snakes and foxes.
When the situation worsened, a young MLA started gatecrashing the public hearings of Maharashtra State Electricity Board with his group of protestors, demanding an answer. "All that you say about Devendra Fadnavis - soft spoken and polite was only for the city. In the field, he is like a true ABVP activist," says an old resident of Nagpur.
Forty four-year-old Fadnavis, for sure has come a long way in politics in a short span. A deshast brahmin from Chandrapur in Vidarbha, Devendra's aunt, Shobha Fadnavis, was a former minister and represented the Mul constituency for a long time. At Dharampeth in Nagpur, his family, comprising his wife Amruta, mother Sarita and daughter Divija, lives in a modest two-storeyed house that also houses his office. Right opposite his house is a playground named after his father Gangadharrao, a prominent RSS leader who later became a Jan Sangh member in the state legislative council. As a child Devendra is said to have refused to go to a certain Indira Convent because it had the name of a leader who had jailed his father during the Emergency.
Devendra lost his father when he was 17. Devendra's political career started in the early nineties, when he joined the BJP as a ward president of its youth wing. He became the youngest corporator of the Nagpur Municipal Corporation at the age of 21 and the second youngest elected mayor in 1997, at the age of 27. Fadnavis is said to have brought to the limelight by Gopinath Munde who saw him as a promising leader.
He replaced Nitin Gadkari's aide, Sudhir Munganthiwar as the BJP State president. Despite rumours of disagreements between him and Gadkari, Fadnavis is said to share a good equation with the union minister, but is seen to have been chosen to hold the post by PM Modi. Critics are however ambiguous about Devendra's appointment as the CM.
"He has been an effective MLA and he is not known to belong to any faction in the party. But beyond that he has no government experience. And his government doesn't have majority in the house which will be a restraining factor too," said Suhas Palshikar, political analyst. "Being a Brahmin with no community support, he will have to depend a lot on the national leaders who are running the party which is not a good sign," Palshikar added.
That, however doesn't bother his old associates recall that most often, leaders such as Ajit Pawar and RR Patil would sit back in the legislature to hear Devendra dissect the budget.
"Even leaders such as Vilasrao Deskhmukh would stop by and congratulate him for his Assembly speeches," BJP member Atul Shah said. Fadnavis is also famous for helping his colleagues write fool-proof speeches by giving them with well researched data. A voracious reader of books on energy, taxes and economics, Fadnavis is known to enjoy a subway sandwich as much as modak or puranpoli. He is a technology addict, and always carries around an iPhone and iPad. He loves old Hindi songs and dialogues from Hindi movies.

(State BJP president and…)
MUMBAI: Maharashtra will have its first BJP chief minister take charge on Friday evening. State BJP president and Nagpur MLA Devendra Fadnavis was unanimously elected the CMdesignate at the BJP legislature party meeting held at the Vidhan Bhavan on Tuesday. The core committee of BJP, under the leadership of Fadnavis, met the governor and staked claim to form the next government as the singlelargest party.
The governor has given BJP 15 days to prove majority. A legislature party meeting held in the presence of central observers Rajnath Singh, JP Nadda and Rajiv Pratap Rudy to choose the CM-designate ended in about 15 minutesFadnavis, front-runner for the post and backed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah, was proposed as leader of the House by Eknath Khadse and seconded by Sudhir Mungantiwar.
The two senior BJP leaders had reportedly posed some degree of challenge to the choice just over a week ago, but the show of support for Nitin Gadkari by legislators didn't interrupt the accession process. "The legislature meet unanimously chose Devendra Fadnavis as the leader of the House. This was supported by Khadse, Mungantiwar, Vinod Tawade and Pankaja Munde," Nadda said.
Speaking briefly after the legislature party meeting, Fadnavis said, "I want to thank all members of the legislature party for showing confidence in me. We all are thankful to the prime minister and central observers. We would like to take along our alliance partners." Senior BJP leaders indicated they would be open to taking Shiv Sena along but that would only happen without any preconditions from the former ally.
"We want Shiv Sena to come along and participate in the government, but the discussions with them are lingering. We will swearin a small cabinet on Friday evening and the process of discussions with Sena will be continued after that," Nadda said.
This confirmed ET's report last week that BJP will swear-in a small cabinet without any Sena members and establish a minority government first before any tie-up with the party. Aspecial three-day session of the state assembly is likely to be called in the second week of November where all the newly elected MLAs will be administered the oath of office and the new government will seek to establish its majority. BJP leaders said Shiv Sena could be taken on board only after this and cabinet expansion would happen thereafter. The full session of the state assembly will take place in Nagpur in December.

Nitin Gadkari declined so BJP chose Devendra Fadnavis as Maha CMBJP
(To ensure that the party…)
NEW DELHI: Devendra Fadnavis' election as the next CM of Maharashtra was a foregone conclusion but until a few hours before the state BJP chief was elected leader of the BJP legislature party on Tuesday, the man who ultimately proposed Fadnavis name, Eknath Khadse, was not willing to thrown in the towel.
While other CM aspirants like Nitin Gadkari and Sudhir Mungantiwar had seen the writing on the wall and had backed out, the north Maharashtra MLA was adamant till a couple of hours before the legislature party meet. While Khadse's body language showed that he was resigned to the fate that Fadnavis would be the chief minister, he continued to assert that he too was an aspirant.
To ensure that the party received the message, he skipped the informal meeting of legislators called at the state BJP headquarters. Instead he gave sound bytes to TV channels from his bungalow barely a few metres away from the state party headquarters. "I am also in the race for the chief minister's post," Khadse kept on repeating to media channels when asked as to whether he was 'unhappy.'
The five-time Jalgaon MLA, however, was cautious and said that there was no question of being unhappy as the chief minister's post was yet to be decided. Khadse left for the party headquarters only after he came to know that BJP's central observer for Maharashtra, Rajnath Singh, had arrived there. Top BJP leaders Rajiv Pratap Rudy, Rajnath Singh, JP Nadda and OP Mathur first had a meeting to iron out details on how to have Fadnavis named as the legislature party leader, before a meeting with the Maharashtra core committee members. Singh and other BJP leaders like JP Nadda are learnt to have convinced Khadse to support Fadnavis as leader of the legislature party.
The convincing didn't take long mainly because sources said that Khadse was aware that he didn't stand a chance against Fadnavis. He was told that to show that the decision was unanimous he would be asked to propose Fadnavis name as the chief of the legislature party.
The Jalgaon MLA had no choice but to agree. Sources in the party said that Khadse was aware that the party had made up its mind on Fadnavis but he kept pegging on to leverage a prominent portfolio in the government. After the core committee meet, the legislators wearing the ceremonial Maharashtrian turban, pheta, trooped to the Vidhan Bhavan building to decide on who would be the state party chief.
While the process to declare Fadnavis as the leader of the legislature party was to take just a few minutes it took longer as a few Khadse supporters took a while to leave from the state party headquarters as they were took time to wear the 'pheta'. After the election, Mungantiwar who was pitching in for Nitin Gadkari and Khadse said they chose the state BJP chief as it was the party decision.

Wipro launches staff retention plan to tackle attrition; to facilitate further academic pursuits

(The "Notch Up" programme is…)
BANGALORE: Wipro has launched one of its biggest employee-retention programmes, aiming to stem the exodus of experienced executives by offering them a chance to study at some of the nation's premier engineering and management colleges.
The "Notch Up" programme is the second major initiative by India's third largest software exporter this year to retain employees with five or more years of experience, as the rate of people leaving the company from this group is higher than Wipro's overall attrition level of 17%, a senior executive said.
"How do we retain this group with (over) 5-6 years' experience who get into Masters in IT or MBA? If we are able to provide them this (opportunity for higher studies),then it serves them and it helps us," said Saurabh Govil, head of human resources at Wipro.
Under the new programme, launched in the second quarter that started in July, Wipro offers employees who have put in more than two years at the company a chance to do Masters at Punebased Symbiosis, Pilani's Birla Institute of Technology and Science or VIT University in Vellore. The company has also partnered with ICFA to offer a two-year regular programme in professional accounting. According to Wipro, more than 500 employees have already enrolled, and its aim is to expand this number tenfold to 5,000 in three years.
The company has worked out a fee structure with the institutes, and staff will be reimbursed the fee based on their scores. "Hope this will help us in retaining talent, " Govil said.
Managing the expectations of employees is one of the biggest challenges in India's IT sector where companies are known to aggressively poach staff from rival organisations. Homegrown IT companies see an uptick in attrition levels during the first quarter of every fiscal year, when people either leave their employers in search of better opportunities or quit to pursue higher education.
Wipro's bigger rival Infosys reported an attrition rate of 19.5% in the first quarter through June. Most companies have taken steps to reduce the exodus of employees, with Wipro rewarding the top 20% of its workforce with double the salary hikes compared with the rate given to average performers and Infosys giving promotions to more than 19,000 employees in the first two quarters of this fiscal year.
Some experts doubt if measures like these would truly help IT firms fight off employee exits as they believe stubbornly high attrition rates are symptomatic of a shortage of technically skilled engineers in the services industry and lack of challenging opportunities for growth.
"Offering to refund tuition fees for MTech programmes at BITS/VIT/Symbiosis is not going to solve the Manohar, a former faculty member at the Indian Institute of Science who is currently pursuing the Jed-i (Joy of Engineering, Design, and Innovation) mission.
"The employees who leave for higher studies abroad do so because they realise that they are not growing in technical competence working for services companies. Employees who opt for this (higher studies), primarily do so to pad their resume with a Masters degree so that they can negotiate for higher salaries next time they move. And if it is going to be subsidised by their employer, even better."
Wipro had earlier this year launched a Distinguished Member of Technical Staff programme, under which it offered engineers an equal opportunity with business degree graduates to climb up the ranks.

BANGALORE: Infosys has given promotions to 4,000 employees in October, as the company continues with its efforts to retain key staff and improve employee morale. With this, it has promoted about 12% of its 1,65,000 employees since the current financial year began in April.
The Bangalore-based software exporter has promoted staff across sales, delivery and business-enabling functions and in all markets. "We announced a quarterly promotion system earlier this year. In August, 5,000 employees across sales, delivery and business-enabling functions across geographies were promoted," said a company spokeswoman. "With the promotions we did at the beginning of this month, over 19,000 employees have been promoted since April 2014."
The latest was the fourth round of promotions by the company, with about 10,000 employees getting better roles in April and June. Then, in his first week as the chief executive of Infosys, Vishal Sikka approved 5,000 promotions. This year's once-a-quarter round of promotions also marks a shift from the longstanding practice at Infosys of giving elevations once a year.
Until now, Infosys' attempts of engaging with employees at different levels - including promotions, offering 100% variable bonus payouts and Sikka's crowdsourcing initiative called murmurations - have not shown any improvement in attrition numbers. Infosys reported an attrition rate of 19.5% at the end of the first quarter, and more than 20% in the second quarter through September. At rival Wipro, the rate was under 17% at the end of the second quarter.
However, some experts say these measures would start helping the company from the current quarter. "For a company of the scale of Infosys, any measures take a little time to reflect," said an analyst at a Mumbai based brokerage. "I believe the company should start reporting lower (attrition) numbers from the December quarter."
Infosys itself remains confident that it should be able to bring down the rates closer to 14y% in the coming months. "Given the amount of emphasis we place on training, we will be comfortable if attrition is 13-15%," chief operating officer UB Pravin Rao said earlier this month when Infosys declared its second-quarter numbers.

E-tailers ahead in online payment; RBI s two-stage authentication a hurdleauthentification
(When it comes to payments,…)
When it comes to payments, the Reserve Bank of India's mission is 'to ensure payment and settlement systems in the country are safe, efficient, interoperable, authorised, accessible, inclusive and compliant with international standards.' And its vision is 'to proactively encourage electronic payment systems for ushering in a lesscash society in India.'
Even after years of efforts by the banking regulator and the financial services industry, nearly half the transactions are done through cheques, and cash deals in the system are still high. What the behemoths could not usher in after years may be well be delivered by the start ups, flipkart. com or snapdeal.com. From purchasing toilet paper to a piece of land on the moon — lunarembassy. com promises to deliver the deed at your doorstep — online companies offer solutions for almost everything you ask for. And, Indians are increasingly hooking on to the internet to buy everything from provisions to electronic gadgets.
India, a country of one-and-quarterbillion people, has just 19 million credit card users, while the number of debit card holders is many times more, at 350 million. However, the value of electronic transactions using credit cards is disproportionately large — 21% of all transactions compared with about 32% through debit cards, according to an Internet and Mobile Association of India report on digital payment. The balance is through internet banking, mobile wallets and prepaid cash cards.
"Banks, under the mandate of the Reserve Bank of India, have made significant efforts to improve security. Therefore, while cash-on-delivery continues to be a significant portion (50%-60%) of the mode of payment chosen by customers, usage of debit cards and net banking have also gone up steeply," says Ankit Khanna, senior vice president for product management at Snapdeal. But when innovations in the ecommerce space are promising to deliver the 'vision and mission' of the RBI, its conservatism and sticking to the rule book seem to be the hurdles in realising the vision.
"If there is a rule in the book, we don't allow it to be violated simply because the innovation is cool," governor Raghuram Rajan said in response to the RBI's stance on enforcing the two-stage authentication of online payments after complaints on cab-hail company Uber. Of course, the central bank's concern relates more to frauds in the online space and the loss to customers.
In fact, online frauds in the country seem to be very low, thanks to the security measures being enforced. But as the debate about the RBI stance continues, electronic payments are gathering steam, with the private sector and international banks grabbing a huge share of the market. The top two private-sector banks, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, are miles ahead of other homegrown lenders in supporting online purchases, right from providing payment gateways to offering financing options to credit card users. E-commerce spending has been growing year on year with the online retail, or e-tail, segment more than doubling this year as compared to last year, says Parag Rao, HDFC Bank's business head for card payment products and merchant acquiring services.
"We're witnessing an increase in purchase of mobiles and consumer electronics online this year. HDFC Bank is a market leader in this space and online retailing is a growth driver for the HDFC Bank payment business," Rao says. According to him, customers prefer credit cards over debit cards for large online purchases. Credit cards are the most preferred mode of payment globally, as customers don't have to first carry out an authentication process and it is generally more simplified, unlike in India.
The online payments market size (on the basis of net transaction cost generated) is estimated to be in the range of $700-800 million in 2013, growing at a CAGR of 50% over 2007-13, according to the India e-commerce industry outlook to 2017, although market estimates significantly vary. Half the online purchases are carried out via private banks' payment gateways. Banks also earn a fee for linking the payment gateway.
The transaction discount rate can vary between 1% and 1.8%, depending on the payment instructions. With a larger category of services moving to the online space, the market is expected to grow. A bigger opportunity is from offering EMI options to finance online purchases. In the case of online retailers,many banks have introduced EMI schemes, especially for high-value electronic durables and mobiles. According to market estimates, India's online credit market is worth about Rs 6,500 crore in terms of loan value and is growing at a CAGR of 200% over 2010-13.
 
"This rapid increase can be attributed to increasing tie-ups between banks and online retail players and significant promotion of EMI options. Most of these options are cheaper than credit card or personal loan interest rates," says Monish Shah, senior director at Deloitte in India.

BJP may decline to form govt in Delhi; wants polls in FebBJP
(However, BJP Delhi…)
NEW DELHI: Delhi BJP leaders did not spell out their strategy after the Centre informed the Supreme Court that President had given his nod to Lt Governor to end the stalemate by inviting the largest party in the assembly to form a government. However, they gave broad indications that the party may decline the offer, leading to the dissolution of the House and fresh polls around February.
Difference of opinion among central leaders and Delhi unit of BJP on whether the party should go for fresh polls or try to form a government were out in the open as they spoke in different voices. Though the overwhelming view appeared to be that there should be fresh polls in Delhi around February, no senior leader of the state or central unit was ready to make a categorical statement on the party's course of action.
Union Urban Development Minister M Venkaiah Naidu told reporters that BJP was ready for fresh elections. BJP MPs Ramesh Bidhuri and Pravesh Verma, who were earlier elected as MLAs from Delhi, have also maintained that there should be fresh polls in Delhi. Union Minister Harsh Vardhan is of the same view, according to party sources. However, BJP Delhi unit chief Satish Upadhyay struck a cautious note, perhaps because he didn't want to antagonise MLAs wary of facing the electorate, as they are not sure of getting the ticket again or winning.
"My answer is the same as it was three months ago. If we are invited to form a government we will analyse the situation and take a decision collectively," Upadhyay said. On its part, Congress accused BJP of trying to indulge in horse-trading to form a government in Delhi.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Congress today said it was ready for fresh Assembly elections in Delhi after the Supreme Court rapped the Centre and the Lt Governor over the delay in government formation in the national capital.
A meeting convened by AICC general secretary Shakeel Ahmed and DPCC chief Arvinder Singh today saw discussions on the current political situation in Delhi.
Delhi Congress's chief spokesperson Mukesh Sharma said that, after the meeting, a unanimous resolution was passed seeking fresh elections in the national capital following the dissolution of the Delhi Assembly.
Congress has asked its leaders and workers to gear up for the fresh elections in the national capital.
"BJP is afraid of defeat in Delhi; that is the reason why it is trying to delay the Assembly elections," said Singh.
Sharma said that the party has asked its MLAs, ex-MLAs, former ministers and municipal councillors to prepare for the Assembly poll battle. Congress workers were also asked to pitch in for the party's membership drive.
"BJP and AAP misled the people of Delhi by telling them lies to garner votes, which the people have now fully understood.
"Voters now will not fall into the trap of these parties," said Sharma.
After the Supreme Court today pulled up the Centre and Lt Governor Najeeb Jung for the delay in government formation in Delhi, Congress has charged that BJP was "running away" from fresh elections in the national capital.

Next Jack Ma may be from India: SoftBank s SonAlibaba
( Masayoshi Son is searching…)
NEW DELHI: Masayoshi Son is searching for the next Jack Ma, a quest which he thinks might meet with success amidst the ranks of Indian entrepreneurs selling to consumers and businesses through the Internet.
Son, 57, the founder of Japanese Internet and telecom group SoftBank, says he is constantly on the lookout for entrepreneurial "heroes" who create jobs in the manner of Alibaba's Jack Ma, who has created employment for 25 million. Son's investment in Alibaba, the Chinese online marketplace, is the stuff of legend with a $20 million investment made 14 years ago now worth $80 billion after the Chinese firm listed earlier this year.
Soft-Bank owns 37% of Alibaba, which had amarket cap of $250 billion on Tuesday. Such "local heroes" could emerge in India as well provided Asia's thirdlargest economy manages to create the digital super-highway envisaged by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. "I think India will be one of the top two economies in this century — it has over a billion people, good education and engineering skills. This is India's century. It could be among the top two economies in the world," he said in an interview on Tuesday.
"With that belief, if you can invest (at a) low price and harvest high price, it's a good investment," Son added, sitting alongside Nikesh Arora, the Google executive he poached recently. Arora, who joined as vice-chairman and CEO of SoftBank Internet and Media in July this year, is spearheading the group's US business, as well as its foray into the media and entertainment industries.
On Monday, SoftBank announced a $627 million investment in Snapdeal, becoming the largest investor in the fast-growing online marketplace. It also announced a $210 million investment in Olacabs, a transport aggregator that competes with Uber. Cumulatively, SoftBank has invested more than $1 billion in Indian startups, becoming the largest investor in that space. In the interaction with ET, Son enthused about Snapdeal's prospects, pointing to its growth of 800% per year. The SoftBank founder is in India on a three-day visit that started on Monday with an hour-long meeting with Prime Minister Modi.
Son, whose stated goal is to head the largest company in the world, was wooed by the Indian prime minister on his recent trip to Japan. "Last month, Prime Minister Modi visited Tokyo. We had a face-to-face meeting. He gave us more confidence that India is going to be more transparent and deregulated with lot of focus and passion to improve India as the environment for investment," he said.
The diminutive Son, famous for sometimes setting outlandish goals (and even achieving some of them), was born in a poor South Korean family. His father was a pig farmer who brewed illegal alcohol. In explaining SoftBank's investment philosophy, Son likens himself to the conductor of an orchestra.
"We would like to be the conductor of the information revolution by looking at the total landscape and understanding which parts are growing to grow more quickly." He will be listening to the pitches of nearly two-dozen startups over Tuesday and Wednesday, in an attempt to identify future Alibabas. SoftBank has grown more than 600 times since its founding in 1981 and the $66-billion (revenue for the year ended 2013) company could potentially grow a hundred-fold, according to Son.
 
The relatively poor state of India's Internet infrastructure — the country's ranking in terms of Internet access is 142 — resulting in "traffic jams on the information highway" could trip up Soft-Bank's plans though mobile provides an opportunity to leapfrog the problem. "If the Internet infrastructure is not there, our investment does not do any good. Now, finally, mobile Internet is taking off in India," said Son.
Mobile commerce in India is booming with top ecommerce companies including Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon seeing nearly half of sales taking place via consumers' mobile handsets. This year, around 225 million smartphones will be sold in India, with many users accessing Internet for the first time on their mobiles. India's ecommerce market is projected to grow seven-fold to around $22 billion in the next five years, according to a CLSA report.
With more than 200 million people currently accessing the Internet, Indian consumers are beginning to buy more online, fuelling a frenzy and a land grab among top ecommerce companies for maximum share of this demand. "That is a huge inflection point for the Internet companies to have exponential growth here," Son said. "Difference between what you can get in India (in terms of technology and platforms) and other advanced countries wouldn't be that much — same technology and platform," he added.
India's strength in software and engineering was the source of long-term advantage compared with China's hardware capabilities, which is being commoditised, according to Son.

BANGALORE/NEW DELHI: Japan's SoftBank has become the largest investor in Indian startups after buying stake worth $627 million (Rs 3,800 crore) in online retailer Snapdeal and leading a funding round of $210 million in taxi aggregator Olacabs.
SoftBank, which made an early bet on China's Alibaba where it owns shares worth around $80 billion, is hoping to replicate its success in India, the Japanese conglomerate's chairman and chief executive officer Masayoshi Son said on Tuesday. "We believe India is at a turning point in its development," he told ET. SoftBank Internet and Media Inc, the unit headed by India-born Nikesh Arora, is now the largest shareholder in the Delhi-based online marketplace that competes against Amazon and Flipkart.
Arora, a former senior vice-president at Google and the vice chairman of Softbank, will take a seat on the board of Snapdeal. Neither company disclosed valuation, but sources indicated to ET that it could be up to $2 billion with Soft-Bank estimated to acquire at least a 30% stake ."SoftBank was always our aspirational investor. Given that Son-san is a true internet visionary and what they've been able to do with Alibaba, we felt he was the ideal ambassador for us," said Kunal Bahl, the CEO of Snapdeal which is receiving its third round of funding this year and counts eBay, Ratan Tata and the family office of Wipro chairman Azim Premji as investors.
Existing investors also participated in this round of funding, Bahl said, without providing details. The other company to have caught the fancy of SoftBank is Olacabs, where the Japanese firm led the funding round with participation from existing investors Tiger Global, Steadview Capital and Matrix Partners." Since SoftBank has a long-term view on all their investments, they make for great strategic partners," said Bhavish Aggarwal, the CEO of Olacabs which raised $42 million in July.
SoftBank and Olacabs declined to say how much the four-year-old company is valued at. Sources indicated that the Bangalore based company has been valued at about $650 million and that SoftBank is now the largest shareholder. SoftBank's first big investment in India was mobile advertising network InMobi, where it funded the company to the tune of $200 million.
So far, the Japanese telecommunications and internet group has sunk more $1 billion into Indian startups, making it by far the top backer of Indian entrepreneurship."Given the pedigree of SoftBank as an investor, their contribution to success of Alibaba and their experience of building out digital businesses, this (Snapdeal) is the most 'strategic' investment in the sector to date," said Siddhartha Nigam, a partner at Grant Thornton India.
Internet-based businesses such as online marketplaces, taxi aggregation services and real estate portals have been the darlings of investors looking to cash in on consumption by the Indian middle class. Most of the money this year has gone to online retail, with market leader Flipkart sucking in $1.2 billion from investors such as Tiger Global and South Africa's Naspers. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, too, has committed to invest $2 billion in the company's Indian operations.
"With today's announcement, SoftBank is contributing to the development of the infrastructure for the digital future of India," said Arora, whose team is scouting for more investments in the country.India is one of the hotspots for entrepreneurship globally, seeding more than two startups every day. Young Indians are more willing than ever before to try their hand at launching new businesses, encouraged by the availability of capital and the falling cost of starting up because of technology.
 
"This is watershed moment for Indian technology companies. The entry of marquee, deep-pocketed investors like SoftBank in the Indian market validates the large market opportunity for value creation that lies ahead of us," said Tarun Davda, vice-president at Matrix Partners and a board observer at Olacabs.

CBI may examine Jayanthi Natarajan on environment clearances

CBI
(The Central Bureau of Investigation…)
NEW DELHI: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has banked on the MB Shah Commission report and its own secret inquiry into a list of nearly 350 files allegedly kept pending by former environment minister Jayanthi Natarajan to lodge two preliminary enquiries on environmental clearances given for mining in Jharkhand forests. CBI could question Natarajan on both PEs, a senior official told ET on Tuesday.
He added that CBI has been looking at the list of nearly 350 files allegedly held back by Natarajan and her office. An official memorandum was issued in January after Veerappa Moily took over from Natarajan as the environment minister, which showed nearly 120 files signed by Natarajan were still held back by her while many unsigned files, some dating back to 2011, were returned too.
"We have been going through the list to ascertain why files were being held back though signed," the senior CBI official said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had in the run up to the Lok Sabha elections alleged that there was a "Jayanti tax" in the Environment Ministry. "We had heard of income, sales and excise taxes but for the first time, we heard about a Jayanthi tax in Delhi without which nothing was moving," Modi had said.
CBI has also taken note of the Justice MB Shah Commission report which had criticised the granting of mining rights in Jharkhand forests to JSW Steel and Jindal Steel and Power Limited in May 2013 by the Environment Ministry.
CBI PEs have been lodged against unknown officials of the companies and Environment Ministry officials. In 2013, the forest advisory committee of the ministry gave permission for diversion of 512.43 hectares of forest land in Saranda for iron ore mining by JSPL and for diversion of another 998.70 hectares of forest land for mining of Iron and Manganese Ore by JSW Steel.
The MB Shah Commission Report criticised these decisions. Natarajan could not be contacted for a comment. But sources close to her explained that the permission to JSPL as well as JSW Steel to carry out mining in Jharkhand was approved by the Cabinet Committee of Investment headed by then prime minister Manmohan Singh. Natarajan's predecessor, Jairam Ramesh, had however voiced his objection in a letter to Singh regarding both the FAC and CCI decision.
"We are procuring all documents regarding the environment clearances given. If everything is found in order and CCI clearances are verified, the PEs can be closed as well," a top CBI official said.

We have not yet announced support to BJP: Sanjay  Sena spokesmanBJP
(I do not think so. What we…)
BJP has nominated its CM, but there's no clarity whether Shiv Sena will join the government. Sanjay Raut , editor of Sena mouthpiece Saamna and party spokesman, clarifies his party's stand in an interview with Akshay Deshmane.
Why are you now offering unconditional support to BJP?
I do not think so. What we (Sena and BJP) are discussing is between the two of us, no third person knows anything about it. Uddhavji will make an announcement and clarify everything soon. We have not (yet) announced support (to the BJP) for forming government.
But isn't this a climb down from poll-time reference to BJP as 'Afzal Khan's army'?
Such attacks keep on happening during election campaigns. Opinions expressed during election campaigns are temporary. It was not a fist fight but a battle over issues. Curtains should come down on opinions expressed on the last day of campaign. This is our position.
Will you carry forward with talks even if Sena ministers are not sworn in on Friday?
Dialogue never ends. Even between India and Pakistan, dialogue has been going on for the past seven decades and we (Sena-BJP) are still friends. Nothing can be ruled out.
Don't you think BJP's is not rejecting NCP's support to reduce Sena's bargaining power?
If the support of Sharad Pawar and NCP, who called BJP "half chaddiwallahs" and "fascists", is acceptable to them (BJP), we belong to the same thought and ideology (as BJP). We were together for 25 years, save for the one month separation.
Is the Sena scared that BJP will withdraw support to it in BMC?
Balasaaheb's Shiv Sena has never been scared of anybody. For Maharashtra's interest, the Sena may have taken a step forward or backward politically, but never out of fear of losing power. Organisation itself is power, according to Balasaaheb. If the need arises, we will contest the 2017 elections to the municipal corporation alone.
How can your party justify support to BJP with Fadnavis as CM as you have always opposed BJP's 'pro-Vidarbha' leadership?
We will not consider him 'Vidarbhawadi'. At this point, we will call him Maharashtra's CM. It is a goodthing that somebody from Vidarbha is becoming CM because for the longest of time, everybody had been crying hoarse that the region has been neglected despite many from Vidarbha ruling the state. If they have a vision for development of the region, they should implement it and erase the feeling of injustice among the people there. It is their duty. They have their own government at the Centre, too.
Is there a difference of opinion in the Sena on joining the government?
There can be different voices within a political party. We are in a wait-and-watch situation. There may be some private conversations happening among some. But the party's leadership has not taken a decision. Also, no official banners from Sena about the government formation were put up. But once Udhhavji takes a decision, it will be the party's official stand and everybody will follow that.

Burdwan blast: Mamata admits to lapses in investigationAjit Doval
(The West Bengal Police was…)
NEW DELHI: The West Bengal Police was slow in moving in to nab the two Burdwan masterminds, Maulana Yousuf Sheikh and Sheikh Kausar, who ran the two madrasas which acted as the training ground for Jamaat Ul Mujahedeen Bangladesh (JMUL), National Security Advisor Ajit Doval had told West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee at a meeting in Kolkata on Monday.
Home Ministry officials say both these men ran madrasas largely attended by girls who were also radicalized and trained in bomb making. "The JUML terrorists had a diabolical plan of slipping into India and marrying local girls to get local identities and hence mask their terror activities. NIA will declare rewards on both these men and a dozen other absconding JUML terrorists.
The suspects' list has now grown to 40 persons and a dossier on them is being shared with Bangladesh," a senior Home Ministry official said on Tuesday. He added that Banerjee had admitted to lapses on the part of her police in the initial probe regarding the Burdwan plot during her hour-long meeting with Doval.
"Sheikh Kausar was available in Birbhum in West Bengal from October 2-5 but made good his escape later. The West Ben gal police could have acted faster to raid and nab him and other persons. The CM acknowledged that her police force had done lapses as almost 50 bombs were recovered by the NIA days after the plot was first revealed," the official said, adding that the entire contour of the terror plot would be clear only after Sheikh and Kausar are caught.
Banerjee, however, is said to have told Doval that the initial lack of action on the part of West Bengal Police wasn't intentional. "The West Bengal Police apparently did not comprehend the scale of the plot and were also busy with the security arrangements for the Puja celebrations, the NSA was told by the CM," the top official said.
"We were expecting a 15-20 minute long meeting, but it went on for over an hour. The NSA impressed upon the Chief Minister that this was a big terror plot and the investigation will carry on for a long time -- hence the cooperation of the state would be essential. Banerjee agreed to the same. The meeting was conducted in a very cordial atmosphere - the CM never raised the question why the probe was shifted suo-motu to the NIA," the official said.
Doval briefed Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday and informed him that the CM has agreed to "come fully on board" in the investigations. The Centre has also given the Trinamool Congress a clean chit regarding any association with the terror plot. It was earlier alleged that the terrorists were working out of the party office.
"They were making bombs in West Bengal since 2011. They had taken a house in Burdwan on rent in July," the Home Ministry official said.

(Demand for data spectrum…)
KOLKATA: Demand for data spectrum is set to drive the upcoming bandwidth auctions with top carrier Bharti Airtel and No. 2 Vodafone India likely to bid aggressively to boost their 900 MHz airwave holdings in regions where they have inadequate 3G spectrum , according to brokerage HSBC. It said Idea Cellular, the country's No.3 mobile operator, may play defensive to hold ground in the nine markets where it faces spectrum renewals.
"Bharti and Vodafone could look at adding more spectrum in the 900 MHz band in existing markets or regions where they have just 5 MHz in the 2.1 GHz band," typically, used for 3G services, HSBC analysts said in a note to clients. The auctions are tentatively scheduled for February. Data revenue growth in the year-ended March 2014 was about 90% year-on-year for the top three players, with No. 3 being Idea Cellular, HSBC said. Revenue from the pricier data services is expected to lead telcos' growth in India, going forward.
Since data services consume more spectrum, the brokerage expects the top two operators to slug it out to corner fresh 900 MHz airwaves, which would be liberalised bandwidth that can be used for both 2G and 3G telecom services.
Another trigger behind the data spectrum demand, it feels, is the incumbents' collective need to double airwave holdings to at least 10 MHz or 'units' to handle surging data growth and achieve benefits of scale from a 2-3 years' perspective.
HSBC expects operator hunger for data spectrum to translate into rich pickings for the government. "The need for capacity spectrum will drive up prices in the upcoming auctions, and we estimate government proceeds at $9 billion (about Rs 55,000 crore), which is 20% higher than its estimates".
The brokerage sees efficient 900 MHz spectrum being auctioned at 1.4 times the base price fixed by the telecom regulator and estimates the less efficient airwaves in the 1800 MHz band to also attract 1.2 times the reserve price suggested by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai).

KOLKATA: The telecom department has finally allotted a bulk of the 1,800 MHz spectrum that Bharti Airtel, Vodafone, Idea Cellular, Reliance Jio Infocomm and Uninor had won in the February auctions. The department of telecommunication (DoT), however, has not given clarity on whether market leader Bharti Airtel and No. 2 operator Vodafone India will be given extra time to reconfigure their 900 MHz metro networks where their permits expire next month.
A top Bharti Airtel executive said the company "had been allotted 1,800 MHz spectrum in all 15 circles" where it won such 2G airwaves in February, but is "awaiting allocation of the more efficient 900 MHz spectrum secured in Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbai.
Vodafone India declined to reply to ET's queries, but two people aware of the matter said it has been allocated its full quota of 1,800 MHz spectrum in all nine circles along with a portion of its fresh 900 MHz airwaves.
An email query sent to Idea Cellular remained unanswered as of press time, but a company executive said the Aditya Birla Group telco had been allocated "a sizeable chunk of 1,800 MHz airwaves it won in the last auction but was yet to receive its 5 MHz block of efficient 900 MHz spectrum in Delhi," that it plans to use for 3G services.
Reliance Jio declined to confirm allotment but two people close to the Mukesh Ambani-owned operator said the company had received full allotment of its 1,800 MHz spectrum in all 14 circles. "Reliance Jio has received the letters of intent and earmarking allocation letters from DoT with regard to the 1,800 MHz spectrum it won in all 14 circles in the February auction," said one of the persons quoted earlier.
A spokeswoman for Uninor confirmed that the Indian arm of Norway's Telenor had "received allocation of 1,800 MHz spectrum in Assam won in the February 2014 auction." She, however, declined to reveal the potential timeline of its mobile services launch in Assam.

(India's acute dependence…)
NEW DELHI: Imagine a situation where an Indian soldier's medical kit is running out of essential drugs on a battle front. This may sound like a figment of imagination, but given India's acute dependence on China for key ingredients (active pharma ingredients) for several essential drugs including several antibiotics, the prospect of such a scenario isn't all that remote. India depends heavily on imports — over 90% — from China for many key raw materials (mostly intermediates and some active pharma ingredients) that go into the making of at least 15-odd essential drugs, reckons a Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) report reviewed by ET.
"Any deterioration in relationship with China can potentially result in severe shortages in the supply of essential drugs to the country. Additionally, China could easily increase prices of some of these drugs where it enjoys virtual monopoly," said Bart Janssens, partner, BCG.
These drugs include the most commonly used painkiller such as paracetamol, Aspirin; antibiotics such as Amoxicillin and Ampicillin, Cephalexin, Cefaclor, Ciprofloxacin, Ofloxacin, Levofloxacin; first line diabetes drug Metformin; antacid Ranitidine.
There are no domestic producers left for many of these such as Penicillin-G, and its derivative 6-Aminopenicillanic acid, or 6-APA, as it is commonly known, making the country entirely dependent on imports for key intermediates used in many essential antibiotics, including semi-synthetic penicillins and semi-synthetic cephalosporins.
The report which the CII and BCG have shared with the government * underlines the risks of such over-dependence on China for critical raw material and commonly used drugs. Any supply risk, in terms of shortage of these advanced intermediates, would endanger the production of APIs and bring the manufacturing of critical drugs to a halt, putting the health of a large proportion of the * total population at risk, he added.
 
A glimpse of just what could go wrong was evident during Beijing Olympics 2008, when China closed down many of its API plants to cut environmental pollution. "This led to an immediate price rise of around 20% in some bulk drugs which were being sourced solely from China. We had no alternative since China has a near monopoly in several APIs," said Ramesh Adige, a pharma expert who was formerly an executive director with Ranbaxy Labs.
Leading Indian drug makers 70% of their total raw material (mainly intermediates) requirements from abroad. Total imports of APIs and advanced intermediates have grown steadily at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18% over the last ten years, from $800 million in 2004 to $3.4 billion at present. China alone accounts for 58 of these imports by value. In volume terms, China's share of imports stands at about 80%. Government officials told ET that they are aware of the situation. The pharma department, which had recently held a meeting with industry stakeholders, may prepare a 'critical API and intermediate list'. Also, an expert group had been set up separately by the previous government to study the matter.
"To start with, the APIs and key intermediates that are needed for making drugs of strategic importance should be given priority when government decides to create incentives to encourage API manufacturing in India," said Aditya Berlia of Apeejay Stya and Svran Group, whose pharma vertical includes companies that make API as well as formulations.
Also, when the incentive structure of APIs is prepared, cause and effect on the entire pharma and healthcare ecosystem should be considered holistically, Berlia who has studied the matter added. For instance, any knee-jerk reaction such as anti-dumping duties without creating capacities at home and back-up plans could back-fire, warn experts.
"Matching benefits which China gives for export of APIs such as tax holidays, low interest rate loans, subsidy for effluent treatment plants and ensuring production facilities could be the first steps," Adige said. Creating API parks can also help, he adds, so that costs can be shared on effluent treatment plants, power plants, and other common infrastructure. Across fermentation and chemical synthesis-based products (groups where the dependence is more pronounced), the report estimates China to be 15 to 40% more cost competitive.

Take Chinas cue: Modi s can launch a Make in India digital economyThe truth is that India’s Baidu is Google, India’s TenCent is Facebook, and India’s Alibaba is Flipkart, owned by Tiger Global and Naspers. 
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
In the last month, India has seen something it's never seen before: Leaders of the world's largest technology companies - Jeff Bezos ( Amazon ), Satya Nadella ( Microsoft ), Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook) and Sunder Pichai (a top 3 Google-ite) all visited India in the span of one month. This week Softbank's Masayoshi Son is touring India, and has committed to invest $10 billion into digital India.
And last week a delegation of Indian digital entrepreneurs toured China, meeting companies like Baidu (worth $75 billion), Alibaba (worth $200 billion) and TenCent (worth $140 billion), all home-grown in China. The Chinese digital economy now contributes 4.4% to the Chinese economy, directly employing hundreds of thousands of people, and indirectly giving white-collar jobs to millions more. Digital China is now a major driver of China's growth story.
So when today, more than ever before, global technology companies are eyeing India, the question the Indian government should be asking is: Should the Indian digital economy be ''Make in India'', or ''Expand into India''? We can take a cue from China. China's digital boom story is, at least partially, due to China's interest in incubating domestic digital business growth by limiting access of global majors to the Chinese market. India, conversely, has been an open door for global companies, which has led to Google and Facebook's domi-nance in India (which today capture more than 75% of India's digital advertising pie, despite minimal operations here). Even India's largest digital company, Flipkart , is over 80% foreign owned by investors. The truth is that India's Baidu is Google, India's TenCent is Facebook , and India's Alibaba is Flipkart, owned by Tiger Global and Naspers. And most of that development, except for Flipkart, is being done abroad.
In comparison to China, India's digital revolution is just beginning. If Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants the digital revolution to be an Indian phenomenon and a major driver of India's economic growth story, he should outline measures that enable and encourage domestic digital business growth, including domestic investment incentive schemes and measures that help Indian companies compete with global ones, including potential FDI restrictions. Doing nothing, as has been done thus far, is a passive way of encouraging global companies to earn more globally out of India's growth story, and may be a massive missed opportunity for a key driver of India's growth in the coming decade.

China can cut economic growth target to 7 per cent in 2015: World BankIt aims to grow its economy by around 7.5 per cent this year, though many analysts expect annual growth to hit 7.4 per cent, the lowest in 24 years.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
BEIJING: China can afford to cut its 2015 economic growth target to 7 per cent and still keep its labour market healthy, the World Bank said on Wednesday, even as it urged Beijing to stop setting rigid growth objectives.
"Our policy message is the focus should be on reforms rather than meeting specific growth targets," Karlis Smits, a senior economist at the World Bank office in Beijing, told reporters at a media briefing.
"In our view, an indicative target of around 7 per cent for 2015 would meet ... the kind of indicative growth that is needed to maintain stability in the labour market," he said.
After 30 years of breakneck, double-digit economic expansion that lifted millions of Chinese from abject poverty but also polluted the nation's air, land and waterways, China wants to retool its economy to generate slower but better-quality growth.
It aims to grow its economy by around 7.5 per cent this year, though many analysts expect annual growth to hit 7.4 per cent, the lowest in 24 years. Both the government and the central bank have rolled out a series of support measures so far to avert risks of a sharper slowdown.
A sweeping reform plan that is China's most ambitious in 30 years aims to overhaul the economy to let market forces supplant central state planning in directing the world's second-largest economy.
The World Bank on Wednesday encouraged China to focus on reforms.
"A prevalent concern is that a policy focused on meeting an ambitious growth target, similar to one set for 2014, would require macroeconomic policies to remain oriented to support domestic demand rather than on reforms," it said.
While some Chinese analysts have argued that only by advancing reforms can China power its future economy, the World Bank cautioned that any growth impetus derived from reforms would not be as potent as those in the past.
"'Second generation' reforms are likely to have a smaller impact on growth than the 'first generation' reforms implemented over the last few decades," the World Bank said in its thrice-yearly update on the Chinese economy.
A calculation made by the World Bank and the Development Research Centre - a think-tank linked to the Chinese cabinet - showed that reforms would increase China's potential growth by about 0.8 per centage points in the first year, the bank said.
Spread over five years, reforms would raise China's growth potential by a total of 3.5 per centage points, it said.
"Implementing such a coordinated reform plan can accelerate China's economic growth potential, but it will not reverse a moderation of growth over the next decade," the bank said.

Crude oil
(The new strategy is being…)
NEW DELHI: Hit by uncertainly over oil supplies from West Asia, India is keen to diversify its imports and wants to buy crude from the US, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan has said.
The new strategy is being planned to guard against disruption in supplies from its biggest sources in the Middle East - Iraq and Syria - as they are caught in problems relating to Islamic State movement.
Asia's second-biggest energy user, which spends $143 billion on import of crude oil in 2013-14, wants the US to extend its policy of allowing gas exports to crude oil as well.
"I met officials from the US recently and asked them to allow oil exports to India. We are keen to import oil from the US, which currently does not allow oil exports," Pradhan said.
India wants to reduce its reliance on the Middle East nations for meeting its oil needs and instead wants to tap Latin American countries including Mexico and Russia.
"We will look at Russia and Latin America too (for oil imports)," he said.
Violence in Iraq and Syria has posed serious challenges to oil supplies. In 2013-14, Iraq supplied 24.63 million tonnes of oil or about 13.02 per cent of India's total oil purchases of 189.24 million tonnes.
India bought 31.73 million tonnes of oil from South America with Venezuela being the principal supplier at 21.58 million tonnes, followed by Columbia at 6.31 million tonnes. It now wants to raise these imports.
Also, it wants to raise imports from Russia which are at a minuscule 0.08 million tonnes. Purchases from Mexico, which were 4.94 million tonnes in 2013-14, are planned to be raised.
"Procurement has to be diversified, taking into account the changing geopolitics in the world," Pradhan said.

Wont hang up boots and sit on armchair: Harish Manwani  UnileverSave precious time tracking your investments
MUMBAI : Harish Manwani , 61, who will retire as COO of Unilever by the end of December this year, plans to have an active work life post retirement. He is clear that he does not wish to "hang his boots and sit on an armchair" after he leaves Unilever. Instead, Manwani is keen on doing a portfolio of things, including those that fall in the realm of advisory roles at a global level, as well as those in which he gives back to society in areas of his interest, such as education. This will be over and above his chairmanship at Hindustan Unilever ( HUL ).
But for a leader who is just two months away from retirement, Manwani's current thoughts are far from anything that would reflect a retired life. His immediate primary objective is to first deliver the calendar year for Unilever as COO, and second, to ensure a smooth transition of the organization into a structure wherein there will be no COO.
Unilever will not have another COO to replace Manwani as the Anglo-Dutch consumer products giant is said to be finding a way of operating without a COO. For Unilever CEO Paul Polman, who had described Manwani as a friend and a respected business leader, Manwani was a key enabler in the drive to turn around Unilever in recent years. A transition to a system without a COO is said to be in the works.
"I have not signed off and got into a retirement mode from Unilever yet," Manwani, also chairman, Hindustan Unilever (HUL), told TOI in an exclusive interview. "I want to make sure I deliver 2014 for Unilever. Second, I have to make sure the transition in the organization is complete." Post retirement, Manwani hopes to engage fully and be associated with things that are global in nature, which includes India.
As to why he did not wish to continue as COO for a couple of years more, Manwani has a cricketing analogy to give: "You may have a great first innings. But if you don't declare the innings in time, you may not have a second innings. There are things that you want to achieve for which you want to give yourself time. If you get into it too early, you may not have the satisfaction from your first innings. Equally, if you are too late, you may not have the time."
For Manwani, who said he stopped working for just rewards long ago, it is a deep sense of privilege that he could work for a single organization for 38.5 years "without ever feeling bored... without ever having a dull moment". While that would sound like Greek to a new-age manager who aspires to be tomorrow's leader, the biggest satisfaction for Manwani has been that he has seen a host of Lever leaders placed in positions of responsibility, not only within Unilever but outside as well. Leaders from Hindustan Unilever, such as Hemant Bakshi, Sanjiv Kakkar, Rohit Jawa, Nitin Paranjpe and Sanjay Sachdeva , are some of them.
Manwani firmly believes the flow of Indian managers into global roles would continue to grow strong. But hasn't he set a high benchmark having reached the COO level? "I am 100% confident that we have a leadership bench strength which is going to be even stronger, even bigger. I feel really good about that. You have to build leaders bigger than yourself, otherwise you have wasted your time."

SIT to probe black money bank accounts by March 2015SIT to assess black money bank accounts by March 2015, says AG

With the government submitting a list of 627 black money account holders to Supreme Court in the black money case, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi on Wednesday said that the deadline for investigation into these accounts, under the Income Tax Act, is March 31, 2015.
He said that the court directed that the sealed envelope containing the names be given to the Special Investigation Team (SIT) and also allowed the government to put its "problems regarding treaties with foreign nations" before the SIT.
"After that we shall request them to submit the report in the court by November 30," Rohatgi said.
"There are about 627-628 accounts along with a status report which we have submitted in the Supreme Court today (Oct 29) in a sealed cover. Last date for investigation and assessment into all these accounts is March 31, 2015.
The court (SC) after hearing both sides, did not open the cover but directed that the sealed envelope be given to the SIT itself. The SIT will thereafter see what it has to do and proceed in accordance with law," the AG said.
Speaking to the media immediately after the hearing, Rohatgi also said that the same list had been submitted to the SIT in June this year.
"The apex court has asked SIT to verify the list given by the government and carry on with probe in accordance with law," he said, adding, "The court has permitted us to place our problems regarding treaties with foreign nations before the SIT."

Vodafone  Airtel users may face service disruptionsAirtel
(While seeking six months…)
NEW DELHI: Millions of mobileusers mainly in Delhi and Kolkata are set to face temporary coverage disruptions in the coming months, after the telecom department rejected the request of Bharti Airtel and Vodafone India for more time beyond their November metro licence expiry deadlines to re-configure their networks to the new airwaves that were allotted recently.
While seeking six months of additional time, the telcos had warned that the eight-month delay in the allocation of bandwidth, which they had won in the February auctions, had left them little time to reconfigure their networks in the cities before the expiry next month, which will mean disruption of services.
For Airtel alone, this means temporary disruptions of close to 15 million subscribers in Delhi and Kolkata, circles where Vodafone India has a combined 14 million users, as per the August-end data.
The telecom department rejected the request, reasoning that any extension of airwaves will automatically increase the time frame of the allotment, which is typically for 20 years, a top official told ET.
"These operators are seeking an extension of six months. However, if we do so, they will then effectively get an extension of a total of one year for the spectrum that they won in February," the official said. "There could be some disruptions but the telcos would need to manage it." In Delhi, part of Airtel and Vodafone's airwaves in the efficient 900 MHz band were won by Idea Cellular, while the two telecom operators won Loop Mobile's airwaves in the Mumbai circle. In Kolkata, while Airtel got more airwaves than what it had before the sale,Vodafone won fewer units of the bandwidth.
More importantly, the frequencies of the new airwaves that have been allotted to these operators are different from what they had earlier and technical changes, therefore, have to be made to their respective networks.
"The issue here is that the telecom operators now have to reconfigure their networks to new spot frequencies within the same band," said Rajan Mathews, director general of Cellular Operators Association of India — the lobby group for GSM operators. Hence, even though Airtel lost only 3 MHz from its total 8 MHz holding in the 900 MHz band, the remaining 5 MHz has also changed in terms of the spot frequencies within 900 MHz.
With their reduced airwave holdings, telecom operators need "at least a couple of months just for network optimisation which will require them to assess the total load in a particular service area, the new quantum of spectrum and thus how many more towers are required," said Hemant Joshi of Deloitte Haskins & Sells.
The operators have been crying foul saying they are being penalised for a procedural delay on the part of the telecom department. The regulatory heads of Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea Cellular are scheduled to meet telecom secretary Rakesh Garg on Friday to discuss the matter.
Mathews confirmed this. "That is why we were asking the telecom department to expedite the allotment of airwaves to us so that we could reconfigure our networks to the new spectrum. Now we need another six months to do so. Operators are not going to earn any revenue from these swapped and newly allotted airwaves," he said.
The operators that won airwaves in the 900 MHz band in the February auctions were issued the earmarking last week. The earmarking letter gives permission to begin using the airwaves from November 30, coinciding with the date of expiry of the current licence holders to use the airwaves.

P&G becomes India s third largest FMCG companyconsumer-products maker
(The company spokesperson…)
MUMBAI: Procter & Gamble, one of the top two FMCG firms in the world, has topped Nestle and ITC to become India's third-largest consumer products maker after nearly doubling its sales in the country in the last three years. P&G's three entities in the country, selling a wide variety of products ranging from detergents and shampoo to razors to sanitary napkins, posted combined revenues of Rs 9,274 crore for the year ended March 2014, slightly ahead of Nestle India's Rs 9,197 crore and the FMCG business of ITC that had sales of Rs 8,099 crore.
"In fiscal 2014, we generated robust sales growth across all entities through a strong innovation programmes across product categories and pricing for added consumer benefits," a P&G spokesperson said. Market leader Hindustan Unilever (HUL) is, however, three times P&G's size in India and competes with it in most household and personal care categories. Number two, Amul, is twice as big with over Rs 18,000 crore in sales but doesn't compete with the US consumer giant in any segment.
The company spokesperson said India, one of the fastest growing markets globally for P&G, remains a priority for the Ohio-headquartered giant. Earlier this year, Procter & Gamble merged India, the Middle East and Africa into one IMEA region as part of a significant reorganisation to remove management layers and improve the execution of strategy.
P&G still has a long way to challenge Unilever in India where it trails its smaller global rival in every category in which they compete. "While P&G has significantly narrowed the gap with competition last decade, HUL has made a comeback in the last three years by grabbing back lost market share," said Abneesh Roy, associate director at Edelweiss Securities.
"It's a tough task for P&G now as HUL is getting more competitive as is evident from their marketing campaigns, product innovation as well as reach," he said.Roy said P&G's latest launch in India, Oral B toothpaste, has met with limited success despite years of planning.
P&G has three subsidiaries in the country — Procter & Gamble Health & Hygiene, which markets feminine hygiene brand Whisper and Vicks anti-cold balm; Gillette India, maker of razors and other shaving products; and Procter & Gamble Home Products, best known as the maker of Ariel and Tide detergents. P&G has been clocking compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of about 25% in the country since the last decade.
In the past two years, it has invested over Rs 2,000 crore in the country. Big investments have taken a toll on its local profitability though. The unlisted P&G Home Products posted a loss of Rs 100 core for FY14, down from a loss of Rs 481.5 crore in FY13. The company is unperturbed.
"We continued to drive profitability in a competitive market environment with strong sales growth and productivity driven cost savings," the P&G spokesperson said. "In addition, our focus on end to end efficiencies resulted in positive cash flows from operations." P&G completed setting up a new multi-product plant in Hyderabad last month, as part of a strategy to ramp up local production and distribution to match up HUL in terms of product prices and reach.

The rupee depreciated by three paise on Wednesday, extending losses for the third straight day, to end at an over one-week low of 61.35 against the Greenback on increased dollar demand from importers ahead of US Federal Reserve policy meeting outcome.
According to a forex dealer, however, strong domestic equity market , fresh capital outflows and a weak dollar overeas capped the fall in the domestic currency to a major extent.
At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market, the rupee commenced higher at 61.26 a dollar from Tuesday's close of 61.32 and immediately touched a high of 61.25. Intra-day, it fell back to a low of 61.36 before ending at 61.35 - registering a fall of three paise or 0.05 per cent.
This is its weakest closing level since its October 20 closing level at 61.36.
The local unit had fallen three paise on Monday and two paise on Tuesday .
Pramit Brahmbhatt, Veracity Group, CEO, said, "Rupee continues to trade in a tight range... Traders are eagerly waiting for the outcome of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting with the anticipation that the Federal Reserve won't raise interest rates for some time. The trading range for the spot rupee is expected to be within 60.80 to 61.80."
Meanwhile, the benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) index Sensex surged by 217.35 points (or 0.81 per cent) on Wednesday to end at a five-week high of 27,098.17.
The dollar index was trading lower by 0.06 per cent against its major global rivals. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) sold shares worth US $11.60 million on Tuesday, as per data released by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).

Kerala s Kiss Day campaign against moral policing: Is it just lip serviceComments
Protesting against an attack on a café in Kozhikode (in north Kerala), a group of youngsters has pledged to assemble at the Marine Drive in Kochi on Sunday (November 2) to celebrate ‘Kiss Day’. The Facebook page of the group, Kiss of Love, has got more than 20,000 likes but that’s about it. It would be tricky to read too much into this. Social media responses are seldom a barometer for change. A one-line description on the page reads: Moral Policing is a criminal activity. Most of political parties and religious organizations tries [sic] to do that.
So come Sunday evening, will Kochi witness a desi version of a kiss-a-thon of sorts? Probably not. The group has its heart at the right place but not its head (or in this case its lips). And that’s because Kerala is not ready for such a change. For all its high rates of literacy and health indices, the social Kerala is still conservative, highly patriarchal and stuck in an era where women are not considered equals and are not respected. Religious institutions will not be comfortable with such a move and are likely to oppose such a public display of affection.
Irrespective of whether Kerala will muah-muah on November 2 or not, one thing is certain — this is not going to change the social and cultural fabric of God’s Own Country. For so deep are the roots of patriarchy in Kerala. A good reflection of this is Kerala’s attitude towards women, especially the way it treats its women celebrities. As long a woman celebrity works within the defined boundaries of ‘culture’ she is seen as an embodiment of virtue. The moment she breaks from that norm, she is ridiculed and her fall from grace is accompanied by aspersions on her moral character. The average Malayalees change in attitude towards Ranjini Haridas, a famous stage-show host, is a case in point.
However, the protest will have political repercussions. The ‘Kiss Day’ gives political parties with a religious leaning an opportunity to further their role as protectors of ‘Indian culture’.
Generally women who speak their mind in Kerala are seen as outspoken — and that’s no pat on the shoulder. The Malayalam term used to describe ‘such’ women is 'ahangaari' — when translated it means arrogant and carries a lot of spite and venom.
Kerala, just like many other states in India, needs to fight against the growing menace of moral policing, but this Sunday is unlikely to start that much-needed revolution. Kerala will not kiss and tell — at least not this Sunday.

Victoria home to a $34.2-billion ICT sector, employing over 91,000
Mumbai, October 29:  
Hyderabad-headquartered Ray Business Technologies (Raybiztech) has chosen Melbourne as its Australian headquarters, and plans to create 30 new highly skilled local Information and Communications Technology (ICT) jobs over the next two years.
Raybiztech delivers cloud, mobility, big data and social media solutions to its enterprise clients around the world.
Key destination
Australian Minister for Technology Gordon Rich-Phillips welcomed the ICT services and solutions company to Victoria. In a statement, he said the Coalition Government had been working hard to make Victoria the key destination for international technology companies looking to set up in the region.
“Our Victoria’s Technology Plan for the Future – ICT is supporting continued growth, development and global competitiveness of Victoria’s ICT sector by attracting more investment and building a stronger Victorian ICT workforce,” Rich-Phillips said.
New jobs
Stating that Victoria is now home to a $34.2-billion ICT sector employing over 91,000 people, and is also Australia’s leading ICT economy, the minister said the Victorian Coalition Government had facilitated more than $1.4 billion in new technology related investment, which was creating more than 5,500 new jobs.
Ray Business Technologies Co-Founder and Managing Director Ajay Ray noted in the statement that the decision to set up in Melbourne was based on favourable factors such as costs, availability of a job-ready ICT workforce, market access, infrastructure maturity, Government policies and ICT strategies.
Long-term plan
The Victorian Government Business Office had initially met Raybiztech at an Oz Fest event in India in October 2012 during a trade mission, with the relationship subsequently evolving out of this initial meeting.
The Raybiztech announcement is a component of the Napthine Government’s Victorian Jobs in the 21st Century plan, a $33-billion initiative to create 200,000 jobs.

Finnish firm growing at 40-50% annually; using Indian staff for global operations
Mumbai, October 29:  
He could be sitting thousands of miles away at his corporate headquarters in Finland but Juha Laurio is keeping a close watch on India.
The President & CEO of Lindstrom knows only too well that the country is a key growth lever for his 166-year-old group, which specialises in supplying workwear to companies worldwide.
Supply points
Lindstrom has been in India for seven years now with service centres spread across Assam, Gujarat, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Punjab.
These are the supply points for clean uniforms to workers in different user industries. There is a rental fee for workwear and the centres take care of their mending, washing and maintenance.
“We are very happy with the India business and see good growth for Lindstrom. This is a huge market where the number of employees across (customer) companies is on the rise,” Laurio told BusinessLine during a recent visit.
Lindstrom is growing at 40-50 per cent annually in India and is increasingly using the intellectual resources in the country for its global operations. A section of employees is already part of management training programmes at the Finland headquarters. This is in addition to planned exchange programmes where there will be a constant flow of people coming to India as part of an effort to better understand work processes.
‘Hungry for success’
“People in this country are hungry for success and that is what is driving them to excel,” Laurio says. It is amply clear to him that a lot of action is happening in Asia, with China and India, in particular, seeing “nice growth which is good news for us”.
Lindstrom is also on track with its Vision 2016, which will see 25 countries being part of the global roadmap. There are already 23 in place and the list should be complete next year with perhaps the new additions happening in the Asia-Pacific region.
“I have no hesitation in saying that India is one of the top markets for Lindstrom and its stature will only grow in the coming years. We are now working on Vision 2020 which will fuel more opportunities through this decade,” Laurio says.
According to Anupam Chakrabarty, Managing Director of the Indian operations, workwear could have been a new concept in India when Lindstrom first set up shop in 2007 but things have changed quite rapidly.
Outsourcing
“Today, companies appreciate the importance of hygiene and safety for workers as well as their image, especially when they are part of a larger global arena with stricter regulations in place,” he says. Many companies prefer to outsource their workwear management to Lindstrom, a specialist in this field. The industries the Finnish group is focusing on are primarily food, pharmaceuticals, healthcare, automobiles and fast moving consumer goods. These are sectors where the demand for workwear is expected to increase in the future.
In the coming years, Lindstrom will look at establishing business units within 200 kilometres of these service centres. This will help it access smaller towns that are seeing rapid growth and set the pace for a gradual expansion in operations to smaller regions.

250 founders to pitch to 20 companies through four-minute meetings
Bangalore, October 29:  
India has emerged the third largest base for start-ups in the world with 3,100 of them after the US, which is home to 41,500 start-ups, and the UK, which has 4,000 start-ups.
The start-up ecosystem attracted 300 venture capital/private equity and 225 angel investment deals worth over $2.3 billion since 2010 and over 20 mergers & acquisitions worth $1 billion in the last 3 years.
Over the last 12 months alone, 805 technology product/digital start-ups were set up across the country, which is projected to grow four-fold to hit 2,000 by 2020. These were some of the key findings of the India Start-up Report 2014 unveiled by Nasscom at the 11th edition of its annual flagship 3-day Product Conclave, which kicked off in Bangalore on Wednesday.
“India has the fastest growing start-up ecosystem in the world and the total number of technology product/digital start-ups is projected to be 11,500 by 2020, employing over 2.5 lakh people from just 65,000-75,000 in 2014. This is the hyper-growth, inflection point for the Indian start-up ecosystem,” said Ravi Gururaj, Chairman of Nasscom Product Council.
Unprecedented growth
Stating that there has been an unprecedented growth in the start-up ecosystem, he said, “We have 120 companies displaying their products for the first time and have had 300 applications for the same; every major accelerator, investor, angel group, VC, corporation is participating in the conclave. We have five summits running simultaneously across the city on various themes - Design, Seed, Growth, Early stage and Innovative Devices, that spans the entire spectrum of the start-up ecosystem. We have organised for the first time, 250 four-minute meetings so that 250 founders of start-ups can present their elevator pitch to 20 companies. We have had 350 requests for this alone.”
Rajat Tandon, Senior Director, 10,000 Start-ups, Nasscom, pointed out that the top six locations accounting for 90 per cent of start-up activity in India are Bangalore (28 per cent), Delhi-NCR (24 per cent), Mumbai (15 per cent), Hyderabad (8 per cent), Pune (6 per cent) and Chennai (6 per cent). However, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Kochi, Jaipur and Thiruvananthapuram are the next emerging locations. Young entrepreneurs dominate the start-up landscape with the average age of founders at 32 years, with 52 per cent being post graduates. Interestingly, only 6 per cent of the start-ups have women founders, he said.
Next steps
Nasscom plans to take 150 of India’s hottest entrepreneurs to Silicon Valley in 2015 as a part of its Innotek initiative, launched earlier in May this year where 30 start-ups were taken to Silicon Valley. Gururaj said Nasscom will launch the Industry Partner Programme, which aims to connect corporates to start-ups early next year, which will help start-ups get ideas, mentorship and access to markets and help them become better companies.
Additionally, policy roundtables will be organised to enhance awareness on product and start-up issues, more warehouses and labs will be set up in Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai and Kolkata, regional Nasscom Product Conclaves will be initiated to build domain focus in different regions across the country, the Aadhaar Diffusion Project which had slowed down during the elections will receive renewed focus, and Nasscom will build industry landscapes to segment the industry by domains in order to build connects with start-ups.

Booked for stealing  Africans roughed up in JalandharJalandhar mob plays judge, ties up and assaults Africans for 'stealing'
Ravinder Vasudeva , Hindustan Times  Jalandhar, October 30, 2014

A court in Punjab on Wednesday remanded to judicial custody two Africans, who were tied to pole with a rope for an hour and beaten up by a mod and policemen for allegedly trying to steal money from a shop.
At a time a debate is raging on hate crimes following Africans nationals in Delhi crying discrimination, the case has hogged the headlines for the treatment meted out to the youth.
They were identified as Irakarama Aiaier, a resident of Rwanda, and Sinarinli Alain, a resident of Burundi. Aiaier, Alain and one Ncuti Roger, another Rwanda resident, are accused of an attempted robbery on Tuesday at a grocery shop in Jalandhar.
While the first two were held, Roger managed to escape.

Even though the arrested have claimed to be students of bachelor of computer applications course at Lovely Professional University (LPU), the university authorities have denied this.
"They are not our students right now. The two arrested were the BCA second year students in the university till March last year, but then they stopped coming to the university," said LPU deputy director Aman Mittal.
The police conducted on Wednesday raids at the paying guest accommodation in where the three were staying.
The police investigation found the two arrested were living in Jalandhar, even as their visa expired a few months ago and they had not applied for an extension.
The police have also sent e-mails to the embassies of Burundi and Rwanda to find out the status of their visa details.
Meanwhile, the assault on the two African nationals has triggered a debate, putting the spotlight on the role of the authorities concerned in such cases. This is the third major case involving African students in the state in as many years. They were tied to a pole with a rope and assaulted for an hour before the police intervened.
In April 2012, Yannick Ntibateganya, a Burundi national, was brutally beaten up by nine locals. He died in June this year after remaining in coma for more than two years.
In June 2013, police booked 21 African students following a brawl with a Jalandhar-based resident.
Local BJP MLA Manoranjan Kalia said, "I am surprised at the casual way in which the local police have been dealing with the presence of foreign students. Why are the police not maintaining a proper record of their presence in different localities? The educational institutes must keep the local administration updated about the whereabouts of these students."

Centre gives black money list to SC  names to remain secretCentre gives black money full list to SC, names to remain secret
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 29, 2014

The government on Wednesday submitted a list of 627 Indians holding accounts in HSBC Bank, Geneva, to the Supreme Court, which directed its special investigating team (SIT) to examine them and take appropriate action.

Handing over a sealed envelope, attorney general Mukul Rohatgi said it contained three documents — the government’s correspondence with the French government, the list of names and a status report.
A special bench headed by Chief Justice of India HL Dattu refused to open the envelope, saying it would be done by the SIT chairman and vice-chairman. “We don’t want to open these papers and embarrass anyone. That has never been our intention,” it said.
Scheduling the next hearing for December 3, it asked the SIT to submit a status report by November 30 after ascertaining who had black money accounts abroad.
The Centre had on Monday disclosed eight names in an affidavit — including those of Dabur India promoter Pradip Burman, a bullion trader and the directors of a Goa mining company, all facing prosecution. Earlier, it had revealed 18 other names.
On Tuesday, the top court directed the government to submit the full list after the latter said it wasn’t possible to make the names of all foreign bank account holders public as all of them may not be guilty of tax evasion. Rejecting the Centre’s submission that such action would breach the privacy of legal account holders, the CJI said, “If it breaches confidentiality, let it be so.”
But on Wednesday, when Rohatgi asked him to open the sealed envelope, he refused to do so.
It was also not clear why the court insisted on getting the list from the government when the latter had submitted it to the court-appointed SIT in June.
Rohatgi told the court the details of account holders were for the year 2006. The data, stolen from HSBC in Geneva, were supplied to France, which passed it on to India in 2011. He said half the account holders were Indian residents who could be prosecuted under income tax laws and the rest were NRIs. Several have admitted to holding foreign accounts but maintain they have paid taxes, he added.
Rohatgi also told the court that most transactions had taken place during 1999 and 2000 and under law, the last date for completion and assessment of all cases was March 31, 2015. Under the IT Act, prosecution for tax evasion can be initiated up to 16 years after the offence.
According to SIT chairman MB Shah, the report submitted by the government has no new details, and the list was the same as the one given to it earlier this year. “We have to question the people named in it,” he told a TV channel.
“The probe is difficult. There is no eyewash. The report will take time. We have already filed the first report in August. I’m hopeful that we should be able to file the final report by next year,” he added.
The Centre, meanwhile, was allowed by the court to raise its objections against making all the names public before the SIT.
“The SIT is headed by two retired SC judges. They are not laymen. Tell them the problems you may face if the names are revealed and let the SIT take a decision on future course of action,” it said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi set up the SIT team comprising regulators and ex-judges to identify illicit fund-holders and repatriate money on the first day in office, as part of a wider clampdown on corruption that he promised during his election campaign.
The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had also accused the previous Congress government of failing to crack down on Indians parking billions of untaxed dollars abroad.
The issue of disclosing the names of foreign bank account holders hogged the political limelight recently, with Jaitley saying the opposition party would be embarrassed if such a revelation was made.
The Congress, on its part, asked the government to come out with complete information without indulging in "selective leaks" and pointed out that "the Congress is not going to be blackmailed under any such threat".
The NDA government said on Monday that Swiss authorities had agreed to provide information to help India investigate leaked accounts, after earlier saying such assistance would break Swiss law.
The court is hearing a public interest petition filed by former law minister Ram Jethmalani in 2009 seeking a direction to the Centre to bring back black money stashed by Indians abroad. Jethmalani had accused the government of attempting to shield powerful politicians and businessmen.
Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal has also filed an application requesting the court to hear him in the matter.
While there are no official estimates, Global Financial Integrity (GFI), a Washington-based think-tank, has estimated that Indians had salted away $462 billion (about 28 lakh crore in current exchange rates) in overseas tax havens between 1948 and 2008.
Black money arises mainly from incomes not disclosed to the government usually to avoid taxation, and, sometimes, because of its criminal links. About a third of India's black money transactions are believed to be in real estate, followed by manufacturing and shopping for gold and consumer goods.
The Congress, meanwhile, said the central government cannot take credit for revealing names of people holding black money abroad when it did so on a Supreme Court directive.
"It is wrong for anyone to take credit for anything that is (being done) by the order of the Supreme Court," party spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said.
The BJP's estranged ally Shiv Sena, too, credited the Supreme Court with bringing out the names in the first list in public domain.
 
"Blackmoney was made a major issue during the Lok Sabha elections (of 2014). The government will not understand how difficult it is to bring back the blackmoney stashed abroad. The Centre has only revealed three names, but the credit for that will go only to the Supreme Court," the Sena said in an editorial in its mouthpiece 'Saamana', describing the names revealed so far as only a 'tip of the iceberg'.
Continuing with his attack on the government, Kejriwal accused the Centre of sparing the big fish holding black money abroad.
"There should not be selective revelation of names. The big fish are being let off," he told the media.

Had a few drinks You may be allowed in Delhi MetroHad a few drinks? You may be allowed in Delhi Metro
Faizan Haidar , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 30, 2014
First Published: 00:16 IST(30/10/2014) | Last Updated: 09:15 IST(30/10/2014)
Comments
In a move that spells relief for those returning home after having a few drinks, the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) has asked the Delhi metro to amend its act that says passengers in an inebriated state cannot travel by the metro.
In 2013, over 5,500 passengers were challaned and were asked to deboard the metro after they were found to be intoxicated.
The CISF’s crackdown on drunk passengers had raised questions as Delhi Police encourages use of public transport in their campaign against drunken driving.
After consulting seniors, the CISF has asked the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to prepare a guideline for passengers, who are drunk.
“Section 59 of the DMRC Act says passengers under the influence of alcohol should not be allowed to board the metro. We have requested them to change it and instead of barring every drunken passenger, those fit enough to walk or are accompanied by someone who is not drunk, should be allowed to travel by the metro. The decision should be taken by the person on frisking duty,” said a senior CISF official, requesting anonymity.
Since alcohol bottles are banned in the metro, the CISF feels banning drunk passengers will encourage drunken driving and result in road accidents.
 “If we find a passenger is misbehaving or may misbehave with fellow passengers during his journey, we can ask the passenger to deboard,” the official added.
The number of passengers caught in an inebriated state in 2013 has jumped 10 times against the previous year. While in 2012, only 591 passengers were caught travelling drunk on the Delhi metro, the number increased to 5,587 in 2013.
In 2011, Delhi Police had caught 107 passengers travelling in a drunken state. According to the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) Act, passengers found misbehaving under the influence of alcohol can be fined `250.
“If our staff on frisking duty finds a passenger is not in a condition to travel, he will be turned away from the gate itself. If the passenger objects, a breath analyser test will be conducted,” the official further said.

Bullion trader Lodhai admits to black money  skips Swiss a/cYou are here: Home > Collections > Dubai
Bullion trader Pankajkumar Chimanlal Lodhai admits to black money, skips Swiss account
Sugata Ghosh, ET Bureau Oct 30, 2014, 07.04AM IST

Black Money
(Lodhai had lent his name…)
MUMBAI: Of the three Swiss bank account holders named by the government, the case of Pankajkumar Chimanlal Lodhai is the most curious. The rotund gold and bullion dealer from Rajkot, of whom few outside Zaveri Bazaar had heard of till Monday, had lent his name to two overseas bank accounts and had advised a Sharjah resident to take large bets on gold, silver and platinum futures on offshore exchanges.
According to a tax official, Lodhai — in a declaration to the income-tax authorities — has spelt out that one account is with a bank in Ras Al Khaimah, UAE, and the other with Standard Chartered Bank, Singapore. In August this year, he had approached the Mumbai bench of the Income-Tax Settlement Commission, declaring an unaccounted income of Rs 14.53 crore.
The Settlement Commission is a statutory body set up under the Income-Tax Act to settle cases of disputed facts related to income liable for taxation. Lodhai has prayed before the commission, which has admitted his affidavit, for immunity from prosecution and penalty, a tax source told ET. Surprisingly, even as late as three months ago he had not declared holding any Swiss bank account.
Lodhai did not respond to a text message from ET while his chartered accountant, JC Ranpura, refused to discuss the matter. Asked whether Lodhai had subsequently shared additional information with the tax department, Ranpura said (over telephone), "I don't know. I don't think so. He is my client and you must understand that I'm bound by confidentiality code." (As per income-tax records, the name of the person in question is Pankajkumar Chimanlal Lodhai.)
According to the source and a person in the Mumbai bullion market, Lodhai has claimed that he provided only consultancy services in helping one Mehul Nandha, who is based in Sharjah, and Nandha's associate firm Wingold LLC to put through derivative trades on precious metals in Dubai and Singapore. While no funds, according to the declaration, were transferred from India to Dubai, Lodhai carried out research and trade analysis. Nandha trusted Lodhai because of the latter's "reputation" and "goodwill" in the bullion world and had also let Lodhai access his server in Dubai by sharing the login ID and password.
Lodhai, in turn, allowed Nandha to use his name to open bank accounts for depositing margin money required to enter into derivative contracts. The unaccounted income for assessment years 2008-09 to 2014-15 was primarily in the books of Shreeji Trading & Co (of which Lodhai is the proprietor), followed by unaccounted stocks of fine gold and loose and studded diamonds with Shreeji Orna ments Pvt Ltd, and unrecorded cash receipts in real estate business.
Lodhai's affidavit provides a peek into the world of bullion trading. Bullion traders place orders with agencies such as STC and large bullion banks like StanChart London and often hedge the price risk as the delivery takes 24-36 hours. Sometimes, Lodhai used to keep the position unhedged and used the physical gold received to "influence demand and supply" in the local market. When there was shortage of gold and price rose, he sold the yellow metal in the local market. Sometimes, these were cash deals, and the money was used to replenish physical stock.
  Some of the transactions and the profits, Lodhai admits, were never recorded. According to a source, Lodhai mentions more than once in the affidavit that the money earned from dealings with his "business acquaintance" in Sharjah is purely commission income. Nandha shared 10% of profits (or Rs 1 lakh, whichever was higher) from a trade.
The Reserve Bank of India prohibits traders in India from taking leveraged trades on overseas futures exchanges for deals that are not backed by any underlying physical stock. But bullion dealers in India say a few intermediaries continue to offer the service, having found a way to sidestep the restriction.
Lodhai, however, is categorical that he has never been an investor as Nandha bore the loss whenever a deal backfired; moreover, UAE, according to him, has the first right to tax on gains made on deals that Nandha cuts. Some of these are finer points of tax. But with the Swiss bank story hitting the headlines, Lodhai's declaration before the Settlement Commission raises a few questions: 1. Does he (or did he) have an undisclosed account with a Swiss bank? (Lodhai has so far denied that he ever had one); 2. How kosher are his deals in the eyes of the taxman; 3. Having admitted the affidavit, how will the Settlement Commission respond to his prayer for immunity?

Diesel  petrol prices likely to be cut by Rs 2.50/L | Norms for FDI in construction easedDiesel & petrol prices likely to be cut by Rs 2.50/litre ahead of assembly elections

deregulate
(This will be the sixth consecutive…)
NEW DELHI: Diesel and petrol are likely to be cheaper by about Rs 2.50 a litre soon, which would dampen inflation as diesel rates would be down 11% in less than two weeks, and cheer consumers ahead of assembly elections in Jharkhand and Jammu & Kashmir, government and industry sources said.
This will be the sixth consecutive reduction in petrol prices since August and the first cut in diesel rates after the government deregulated the fuel. The Cabinet on October 18 allowed state oil firms to align pump prices of diesel with market rates and announced Rs 3.37 per litre price cut. Petrol price was deregulated by the previous UPA government in June.
The planned reduction in auto fuel rates in the next few days would bring down petrol prices to a 16-month low and diesel prices to a level where it existed a year ago. The steep price cut is because of a sharp fall in international oil prices. Brent crude dropped to a four-year low of $82.60 per barrels two weeks ago from above $115 in June. It was trading at $87 per barrel on Wednesday.
According to international oil price data, companies are having margins of about $7-8 per barrel on petrol and diesel in the current pricing cycle compared to previous fortnight and the rupee-dollar exchange rate variation minimal, sources said. "But, a definite figure would be known only by the weekend after we get figures for remaining three days.
This could change the average and pump price. According to international oil price data, companies are having margins of about $7-8 per barrel on petrol and diesel in the current pricing cycle compared to previous fortnight and the rupee-dollar exchange rate variation minimal, sources said. "But, a definite figure would be known only by the weekend after we get figures for remaining three days. This could change the average and pump prices would change accordingly,"an industry executive said.
Now, the government is theoretically out from fixing retail prices of petrol and diesel, executives of state oil marketing firms often meet every fortnight to decide pump rates. The next pricing review is expected on Friday or Saturday, where decision of exact quantum would be taken after tacit approval of petroleum ministry.
According to government sources, the election code of conduct may not apply on diesel and petrol price cut as both the fuels are already deregulated and prices are fixed by industry based on fluctuations in the international oil markets.
Sources said the government would direct state oil firms to retain a significant cushion on at least diesel price before announcing the fuel price cut. The cushion, which is expected to be around Rs 1 a litre, will help in holding the pump price of diesel in case its rate spikes in the international market in the first fortnight of November.
 
The NDA government would not like fuel prices to jump during state elections starting from November 25.
Even when the government reduced diesel price on October 18, it had retained a 56 paise per litre cushion to protect the consumer from any sudden jump in volatile international markets. The government had decided to deregulate diesel at a time when companies had started making an over-recovery of Rs 3.56 per litre.

Richard Branson on  Modi Sarkar : Now  India has a leader who leads by exampleIndia
(If we can get the British…)
Calling Richard Branson busy would be stating the obvious. But for the owner of a conglomerate that controls an airline group, a telecommunications company, a seller of holidays and one which is planning to operate commercial space flights, he looks surprisingly laid-back. Branson has just returned from Mexico City — where he was discussing 'drug mafia wars' with the mayor — to celebrate Virgin Atlantic's maiden flight with its brand new Boeing Dreamliner 787-900 to Atlanta. He cracks jokes about his businesses, his colleagues and his rivals at British Airways. He says his friend Tony Fernandes wants him as a stewardess in AirAsia India and that he is "considering the offer".
Branson had actually dressed up as a stewardess in an AirAsia X flight in 2012 after losing a bet on the results of Formula One racing. Branson is perhaps one of the prime examples of tycoons who are brand ambassadors of their own businesses, an image Vijay Mallya of Kingfisher Airlines tried to replicate. Branson's Virgin Group hasn't expanded in India as much as many would have expected it to. His airline will stop flying to Mumbai in December, one of the two flights it currently operates to the country, as it isn't making money. This is a far cry from his plans to invest $300 million in the country, which he announced after a song and dance affair and a ride atop elephants in Mumbai in 2012.
The airline's plans changed last year after it shifted focus to transatlantic routes, especially as a result of its partnership with Atlanta's Air Delta, forged in 2012. Branson's Virgin Mobile, which has an equal partnership with Tata Teleservices for its India operations, also hasn't grown from being a fringe player in the market. In an interview with ET's Anirban Chowdhury, Branson speaks about his optimism about the Indian market, his views on the Jet-Etihad combine and his sympathy for Mallya. Edited excerpts.
Do you think the change in government makes for a better business environment in India?
The impression from there is very positive. India was doing so well and then it languished for 3-4 years. Now it does seem that it will get back on track to doing really well. It is great to have someone in charge who has business experience. I am biased, but I think that helps. I think it's fantastic to have a leader who's trying to stamp out corruption. I think corruption rots society, especially if it starts from the top and goes all the way down. Now, you have a leader who leads by example. So (I am) very hopeful that India will welcome competition which is good for the consumer.
Does it encourage you to bring more of your businesses to India?
Certainly, it encourages me to do so. We will certainly be looking at India again and thinking what else we can do there. I am sure we will be trading a lot more with India in the future. We are putting a brand new $124 million plane (Boeing Dreamliner) in Delhi. So that's a good start.
Your 'look West' policy, so to speak, has you taking capacity out of the east. Don't you think it will be too late to expand there when you finally look at it again, especially with the growing dominance of Gulf carriers?
If we can get the British government to be brave and build extra runways at Heathrow, we will definitely do a lot more expansion in the east. For every slot that we need for a profitable route, we have to give up another route —that's really sad. I would much rather have stuck with Mumbai longer, especially at a time when India came out of its recession. But we had to move that slot somewhere else, and so we moved it somewhere else. But we will be back in Mumbai some day.
 
Overall, do you think the might and aggression of the Gulf carriers are a threat to western carriers?
I think Virgin Atlantic has got a very, very loyal following. We have about 50 planes to a Gulf carrier's 500 planes. On the specific routes that we fly, we still get our fair share of customers. People like our product. What the Gulf carriers have done is incredible. But we want competition and we will fly alongside them on certain routes.
One of your partners Etihad Airways (Virgin Australia) has picked up 24% stake in India's loss-making carrier Jet Airways. Do you think it will be able to turn Jet around, going by what it's done for your airline yet?
I don't know enough about the details of the deal. Etihad has very deep pockets, but at the end of the day, it's answerable to its shareholders. Jet is a good airline. So, my instinct is that they may well pull it off. There is a very aggressive new lowcost carrier in India. I have known them for a few years. They took care of Virgin Atlantic when we first came there. And they are going to give people a run for their money. So, Jet's got formidable competition, but we will see what happens.
Do you mean AirAsia or IndiGo?
I mean IndiGo.
Vijay Mallya is often compared to you. He isn't going through the best phases of his business. His airline is grounded and his liquor businesses are in heavy debt. Any words for him?
It's obviously sad to see people stumbling. I am sure he (Mallya) will learn from his mistakes and pick himself up and tries all over again. I wish him and anybody who stumbles, well.
No comment on the comparisons?
Well, he's got a beard... (laughs)

Internship stipends jump 30-40% for B-schoolersB-school
(Big recruiters at leading…)
MUMBAI: Big recruiters at leading B-schools are hiking stipends for summer internships by 30-40%, sending out a strong signal that they expect the economy to rev up and the job market to turn red hot in FY16 and FY17. Companies are offering as much as Rs 4.2 lakh for a two-month internship and large and established companies are jostling with upstart ecommerce startups for fresh talent.
Online retailer Snapdeal — which just raised $627 million from SoftBank — has already made offers to over 50 interns during summer placements compared with 15 last year. It is offering stipends of Rs 1 lakh for two months. Goldman Sachs will be offering stipends of around Rs 1.55 lakh; HUL , Marico and Castrol around Rs 1.5 lakh; Barclays Shared Services around Rs 1.6 lakh and Dabur approximately Rs 1.4 lakh, campus sources said.
The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) has offered a stipend of Rs 3 lakh, said a member of the IIM-Indore placement team. Companies started picking candidates from IIMs, MDI, IMI, XLRI, NMIMS and XIM-Bhubaneswar this month, for internships in the summer of 2015. Summer internships are now a key component in the campus recruitment process.
Most companies are likely to roll out preplacement offers (PPOs) at the end of the summer internships, rather than wait for the placement season in end-2015. BCG, for example, offered jobs to 80% of the 48 students who interned with it this summer.
"We will make at least 15-20% more summer internship offers this year," says Suresh Subudhi, partner and director, BCG India. In all, many companies now find almost 60-70% of their total campus hires through the internship and PPO route. Snapdeal, which offered only two profiles to interns last year, headed to campuses with nine profiles this year, across marketing, supply chain, finance, HR and product development.
"We have covered around 8-9 campuses so far and by the time we finish with the three IIMs at Ahmedabad, Bangalore and Calcutta, we would have made close to 70 offers," says Saurabh Nigam, VP-HR at Snapdeal. B-schools are cruising through the summer placements despite almost all of them having larger batch sizes to place. At IIM-Indore, 153 companies snapped up the 557-strong batch for internships this year. It took 181 companies to find internships for 454 students in last year's batch. At IIM-Kozhikode, recruiters are on an average hiring one-fifth more interns than last year.
The average stipend at IIM-Indore was Rs 71,000 for a two-month internship period, 42% higher than last year. At TAPMI-Manipal, Google and Flipkart have paid the highest stipends of Rs 50,000 per month. XIM-Bhubaneswar on its part has seen an almost 30% increase in average stipend with the highest offered so far pegged at around Rs 1.5 lakh in the FMCG sector.
"The numbers this year have been very heartening with a number of first-time recruiters on campus," says Mayank Tabeck, co-ordinator, student placement committee at XIMB. Among the institutes that have already completed their placements this year, MDI-Gurgaon has seen the highest stipend cross Rs 4.2 lakh. At IIM-Lucknow, intern placements for the 464-strong batch got over in just 4.5 days with several first-time recruiters making their presence felt.
Many companies have increased their stipends this year considering the competitiveness in the industry, says Rajan Saxena, vice-chancellor of Mumbaibased Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies (NMIMS), where the highest stipend this year has already breached the Rs 1.6 lakh mark. The institute has just started its summer placements.
While prominent recruiters including BCG, Cognizant Business Consulting, ICICI Bank, Deloitte, HUL, ITC, RPG, HSBC and Asian Paints continue to throng campuses, ecommerce players and startups are hot property. IIM-Indore saw over 15 companies in this space including Flipkart, Snapdeal, eBay, Shopclues, TaxiforSure and Urban Restro while TAPMI had the likes of Gift-XOXO, Paytm and My Deals 24*7 apart from Flipkart.
"Students are more eager than ever before to join this space," says Subir Verma, dean, corporate relations, placements & alumni affairs at IMI-Delhi. IIM-Bangalore , which kicks off its internship placement on October 31, is expecting 120-130 companies to participate. At IIM-Calcutta, 200 companies have so far confirmed for the summer placements for the 464-strong batch.

US Fed ends bond buying  confident of US recoveryFederal Reserve ends bond buying, exhibits confidence in US recovery
By Reuters | 30 Oct, 2014, 12.25AM IST
The Fed statement retained its guidance on rates, saying they would likely remain near zero for a "considerable time" following the end of the bond purchases.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
WASHINGTON: The Federal Reserve on Wednesday ended its monthly bond purchase program and dropped a characterization of US labor market slack as "significant" in a show of confidence in the economy's prospects.
In a statement after a two-day meeting, the central bank largely dismissed recent financial market volatility, dimming growth in Europe and a weak inflation outlook as unlikely to undercut progress toward its unemployment and inflation goals.
"On balance, a range of labor market indicators suggests that underutilization of labor resources is gradually diminishing," the Fed's policy panel said in an important departure from prior statements, which had described the slack as "significant."
"The committee continues to see sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy," it said.
US stocks added to earlier losses after the statement but came back to close down only marginally, while the yield on the 5-year US Treasury note jumped, putting it on track for its biggest one-day increase since mid-March. The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note was little changed.
The dollar rose to a three-week high against a broad basket of currencies as traders pulled forward expectations of when the Fed would eventually raise interest rates.
Rate futures shifted to show better-than-even odds of a rate increase in September 2015; previously, they had pointed to a hike in October. The Fed has held rates near zero since December 2008 and has more than quadrupled its balanced sheet to $4.4 trillion through three separate asset purchase programs.
"The market is saying that the Fed has now stepped closer to tightening interest rates because of the labor market," said Andrew Wilkinson, chief market analyst at Interactive Brokers LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut.
The Fed also added broad, flexible language that ties the timing and pace of any future rate hike to incoming economic data, as Fed Chair Janet Yellen has stressed in recent remarks.
While the central bank retained its basic guidance that overnight borrowing costs would remain near zero for a "considerable time" following the end of bond purchases this month, the new phrase marks a turn towards a new regime.
"If incoming information indicates faster progress toward the committee's employment and inflation objective than the committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than currently anticipated," the statement said.
ROUNDING UP THE VOTES
The changes in language seemed to accommodate the concerns of Fed officials worried the central bank was falling out of step with improvements in the economy. Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser and Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher, who dissented at the previous meeting last month, voted in favor of the statement this time.

Govt relaxes FDI norms for construction  real estateGovernment relaxes FDI norms for construction, real estate sector

(The move will facilitate…)
NEW DELHI: The government eased overseas investment rules in construction to attract money into the funds-starved sector and serve its twin objectives of faster job creation and housing for all. The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved a comprehensive proposal by the Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion (DIPP), dropping the minimum 10-hectare rule for serviced housing plots and slashing the minimum floor area for construction development projects to 20,000 sq m from 50,000 sq m to be eligible for overseas investment.
It also halved the minimum foreign direct investment (FDI) amount to $5 million from $10 million and substantially eased the exit norms, raising an across-the board cheer from an industry that now hopes for bigger foreign fund flows into a sector that desperately needs money.
"The government is bang on (target). We are very glad about the trunk infrastructure completion part as it will bring in asset-based FDI. This will ensure that project developers who have taken FDI are not left with more debt," said Rajeev Talwar, executive director of DLF, India's biggest listed developer. Trunk infrastructure refers to essential amenities such as roads, water supply, street lighting, drainage and sewerage.
The new rules will also give a boost to the 100 smart cities being planned by the government. Home buyers will also cheer the relaxation as fresh inflows raise the possibility of projects that are stuck getting completed and cheaper housing becoming available going ahead. Most housing projects are running one to two years or even more behind schedule because of the slowdown and the shortage of funds on account of elevated debt levels.
"It is an excellent move by the government and will definitely help the developers which are running late with their projects due to the funds crunch. Townships take a minimum of 10 years to be completed, so the relaxation will ensure that funds are not a problem," said RR Singh, director-general of National Real Estate Development Council, or Naredco. The norms will come into force after DIPP issues a notification. The government has promised housing for all by 2022 and toward that end provided an incentive for affordable housing in the revamped policy.
The sectoral condition of minimum area and capital will not apply if the developer sets aside 30% of the project for affordable housing, defined as dwelling units of less than 60 sq m. Singh said finding 10 hectares of land in tier-I and tier-II cities was difficult, so scrapping this rule will encourage investors to bring in money. In its July budget, the new government had said it would relax foreign investment rules for the sector. The government is also looking to boost construction of hotels, tourist resorts, hospitals, special economic zones (SEZs), educational institutions, old-age homes and invest ments by non-resident Indians (NRIs), giving free access in these segments.
"These measures are expected to result in enhanced inflows into the construction development sector consequent to easing of sectoral conditions and clarification of terms used in the policy," the government said in a statement. The sector attracted $1.2 billion in FDI in 2013-14, down 8% from 2012-13. The most significant incentive to foreign investment is the easier exit compared with the existing rule of a three-year lock-in after the completion of minimum capitalisation of $10 million. Under the new rules, investors will have to bring $5 million within six months of commencement of projects and the balance over 10 years or before the completion of project, whichever is earlier.
The investor can exit on completion of the project or three years after the final investment, subject to the development of trunk infrastructure. FDI can be repatriated or transferred before the completion of the project if approved by the Foreign Investment Promotion Board. "Lingering issues with respect to lock-in requirement and exit route along with the prohibitive minimum threshold for built-up area have had a dampening effect on FDI in the sector," said Sachin Sandhir, global managing director, emerging business, and MD, South Asia, RICS.
"A positive announcement towards this end is indeed welcome and will encourage more investors to consider investing in India, if they are able to exit from the projects sooner." The construction sector, which has a significant ripple effect on the economy, grew only 1.6% in FY14, contributing to the sub-5% growth in the year.
 
"Investment in the construction development sector has a multiplier effect on the economy by way of infrastructure creation; substantial employment generation over the entire spectrum from unskilled workers to engineers, architects, designers as well as financial and other supporting services," the government said. Talwar of DLF expects the measures to lead to a revival in the sector and the wider economy.

Delhi govt formation: L-G to hold talks with all partiesMinority govt possible in Delhi, says SC
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 30, 2014

Terming lieutenant governor Najeeb Jung's move to talk to all political parties on forming a government in Delhi as "positive", the Supreme Court on Thursday adjourned hearing on the matter to November 11.
"There could be a minority government with outside support of a political outfit. Let us wait for some time," the Supreme Court said while hearing a plea from the Aam Aadmi Party on dissolving the assembly and holding fresh polls in Delhi.
Referring to recent media reports, a five-judge constitution bench headed by Chief Justice HL Dattu said, "Whatever I have read in newspapers, it appears that the L-G has made positive moves."  
The bench asked Prashant Bhushan, counsel for AAP, to file a plea seeking dissolution of the Assembly, to wait for sometime as the L-G had started the consultation process with the political players in the national capital and adjourned the matter till November 11.
During the brief hearing, the bench also comprising justices J Chelameswar, A K Sikri, R K Agrawal and Arun Mishra, said that if the LG feels that there is a possibility of government formation, then he should be given time to explore it.
L-G Najeeb Jung, who returned from abroad Wednesday,  had met Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and called the BJP, Congress and AAP to discuss any possibility of forming a government.
"In view of the President's approval to explore the possibility of installing a popular government in Delhi, the Lt Governor would be exploring the possibilities with the leaders of all political parties over the next few days," LG's office had said.
BJP, which is the single largest party, is yet to give any clear signal on its strategy but there were indications that the party was preparing for fresh polls in January or February.
Sources said BJP president Amit Shah and Union ministers Nitin Gadkari and Rajnath Singh were in favour of the party forming a government while some others were of the view that it should not run away from polls when Prime Minister Narendra Modi's rating was high.
"There is a possibility of the party turning down offer of government formation," a senior party leader told PTI.
The L-G's decision to begin consultations with the political parties came a day after a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice H L Dattu slammed the Centre and the Lt Governor for delay in taking a decision on government formation in Delhi.
AAP and Congress had come down hard on Jung, questioning his move to hold consultation with the parties when it was clear that no party was in a position to provide a stable government.
Currently BJP, along with ally Akali Dal's lone MLA, has 29 legislators and will require the support of five more MLAs to prove majority in the 67-member assembly if it decides to form the government.

Delhi-bound train escaped firebomb attack in SeptComments
A re-run of the Samjhauta Express firebombing was averted on the first day of Navratra last month when a powerful incendiary improvised explosive device (IED) was detected and disposed of from a passenger train in Rewari, Haryana, counter-terror sources told HT.
The bomb — with a timer and detonator connected to a container of liquid insect killer with firecrackers tied to it — was found in an abandoned bag on the Rewari-Meerut train on September 25, they said. The train was on its way to Delhi.
A passenger, suspicious that the bag’s owner hadn’t come back in a while, informed the railway police, who found protruding wires in the bag. “A bomb squad was called in from Gurgaon and defused the IED three hours after it was found,” one counter-terror official said on condition of anonymity.
“It is suspected that the IED was planted by alleged Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) operatives who are on the run after their hideout in Uttar Pradesh’s Bijnor town was busted last month after an accidental blast,” the official said.
A witness who was shown photographs of these men said one of them resembled the bag’s owner, the official said, adding, “These SIMI operatives had escaped from Madhya Pradesh’s Khandwa jail in October last year.”
“Had the IED exploded, it would have sent flames flying around the inflammable train coach, possibly resulting in a repeat of the Samjhauta Express firebombing,” the official added.
In 2007, incendiary IEDs planted by alleged Hindu extremists on the India-Pakistan train had killed more than 60 people, mostly Pakistanis.
 
A day after the bomb find, a senior Haryana Police officer called in counter-terror officials from the central agencies to inspect the scene. 
There were also reports that some policemen had tried to break the IED with lathis but these could not be confirmed.

Sena to decide on joining BJP govt  warns against NCP supportThe Shiv Sena made another desperate effort on Thursday to reach out to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), even as it promised to announce its stand on joining the Devendra Fadnavis government soon.

The Sena, in an editorial in mouthpiece Saamna, praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister-designate Devendra Fadnavis, saying the state can expect 'acchhe din' (good days) under them, but cautioned its former ally against accepting Nationalist Congress Party's (NCP's) support.
 
It said that the first big challenge the Fadnavis government will face will be the floor test and that if the BJP seeks support from the Sharad Pawar-led NCP, it will raise questions about its credibility.
 
"You (BJP) have come to power by promising to convert Maharashtra into a corruption free and a Congress-NCP free state.
You (Devendra Fadnavis) come from the Vidarbha region where the NCP had carried out a huge irrigation scam," the Sena said.
Meanwhile, Fadnavis is in Delhi to hold talks with and BJP president Amit Shah, just a day ahead of the Maharashtra CM's swearing-in ceremony at the Wankhede Stadium.
Uddhav's party has also told the BJP to include its leaders in the oath-taking ceremony, TV channels reported early Thursday, quoting unnamed sources.
A Sena leader told mediapersons on Wednesday, "We met (Shiv Sena chief) Uddhav Thackeray and discussed the future course of action with him. The wait is over now, just one more day. We will announce our decision tomorrow (Thursday)."
However, there are also indications that the Sena was ready with a Plan B, which includes Uddhav's party contesting the assembly speaker's poll — a move that could make the BJP uncomfortable.
The BJP, which has 122 seats in the 288-member Maharashtra assembly, needs 23 more legislators to reach the magic figure. BJP legislator, Govind Rathod (elected from Nanded district), died of a heart attack last Sunday. With the support of small parties and independents, the BJP's tally is around 135.
The NCP, with 41 MLAs, has offered unconditional support to the BJP on the day election results were declared. Some reports also said the BJP was prepared to run a minority government.
But, speculations are rife that the BJP will finally join hands with the Sena. The two parties parted ways ahead of the October 15 elections following differences over the sharing of seats.
While the Sena is demanding one-third of the portfolios in the Maharashtra cabinet - and the swearing-in of two of their ministers with Fadnavis' team - the BJP continues to play hardball with its former ally, apparently buoyed by the advantageous position it is in.
Even though JP Nadda, the newly-appointed BJP general secretary in charge of Maharashtra, said his party wanted to take the Sena along, there are reports that no breakthrough was in sight yet.
A top central BJP leader, when asked if there was any headway in discussions with the Sena, said talks would resume only after the oath- taking ceremony on Friday.
"No talks (with Sena) are currently underway. Our whole focus is on making October 31 a grand success. We will resume talks only after that," he told PTI, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
Meanwhile, a source said Uddhav was prepared for the worst and had started working on an alternative.
The Sena has zeroed in on the names of some of its legislators for the leader of opposition position.
According to Sena leaders, the BJP is asking them to be part of the government without any concrete proposal, and that is unacceptable to Uddhav.
"If we are going to be part of the government, then we should know how many ministries we will get. We need our ministers to be sworn in along with the BJP ministers.
"Right now, all the BJP has said is 'come on board and then we will decide'. The Sena doesn't want to seem like a beggar. It has been conveyed to Uddhavji that we are ready to sit in the opposition," said a senior Sena legislator, adding that the Sena chief did not want to seem as being "unreasonable" by refusing to speak with the BJP.
Another legislator said the BJP must realise that before proving majority in the assembly, they will have to elect a Speaker.
The Sena is in talks with the NCP and the Congress to support a Sena candidate for the post.
If this happens, the BJP will then be forced to deal with the Sena for all decisions in the House, including passing important bills.
"...things will get difficult for the BJP on the floor of the House," said the MLA.

Impatience creeps in  aspiring India stressed and dissatisfiedprint
Sort through the noise and fury that characterise modern Indian politics and three things emerge.
First, the Congress-led UPA government was a bastion of old-style, slow-moving government. Many of its constituents were either corrupt or condoned corruption — for whatever reason: Patronage, personal profit or the cost of coalition.
Second, as recently available statistics reveal, the UPA got some things right.
Stubbornly high levels of malnutrition fell, fewer mothers died, more Indians climbed out of poverty than ever before and fewer went to bed hungry. But the government could not deliver what these millions with improving lives wanted — education and jobs to meet soaring aspirations. The first half of its 10-year reign witnessed unprecedented economic growth, which tailed off during a scandal- and hubris-ridden second term.
Third, Narendra Modi swiftly disrupted India’s politics-as-usual model. The new prime minister’s ideas, whether his own or borrowed from the UPA and outfitted afresh, show purpose and determination. These include launching legal and labour reforms, drives to clean up India and grow manufacturing, freeing diesel from price controls, giving bank accounts to all Indians, cutting subsidies and making them more efficient by revving up Aadhaar, the unique identification system conceived — and crippled — by the UPA. While you can question some of these moves (emasculating environmental laws and discarding some subsidies) and debate the impatience over implementation (even the RBI governor warns against the dangers of a universal banking drive on steroids), you cannot but admit these are ideas whose time is past due.
Now that India has a government that appears responsive to emerging India’s aspirations, is clear-headed in its actions — including a disturbing tendency to quietly encourage its extremist fringes and marginalise minorities — and marking out the roads ahead, it could be time to debate some destinations. It is pertinent to note that despite the vast gulf in personality, popularity and style, Manmohan Singh and Modi share many similar economic views, in particular a free-market, top-down, a rising-tide-floats-all-boats approach to development.
This view translates into a model that urges a more literate and urbanised nation, made that way by rural-to-urban migration, factories and dams, a model that measures hard indices of progress. The soft indices of progress include health, nutrition, quality of education, pollution and female emancipation (the last mentioned is getting particular attention from Modi).
Merging the two models will, ideally, measure a nation’s overall well-being. That is not the case in India (or in the nation India envies, China). From Nehru to Modi, the Indian establishment has always prioritised the hard indices. In many ways, this is not hard to understand. The argument: India has always been so far behind with the basics — electricity, roads and jobs — that it has rarely had the luxury of looking beyond.
There are now strong indications that what lies beyond might not be as appealing as we think. Millions who have moved up the economic scale will contend that their life is better than ever —  and they would be right. But there are no indices, hard or soft, to explain why those who believe they have made it, often, cannot shake the feeling that life is more stressful and dissatisfactory than ever.
A strong indication of the perils of the Indian path to success comes from lush Kerala, the state that preceded Gujarat as a model of development. As my colleague Jyothi Shankaran recently reported, quoting government health statistics, other things remaining the same, by 2025, Malayalee men will live to 75 years and women to 79 (the general Indian estimate is 70 and 72), a consequence possibly of spending more on health per capita than any other state. Kerala is also now India’s most urbanised state, with nearly 48% of the population living in towns and cities, up from 27% in 2001.
But weigh these measures of progress against softer indices and you may begin to understand why Kerala is more stressed than ever. The men in God’s Own Country have a blood-sugar measure that is four times the national average and India’s highest. Once a nation of wiry, fit people, Kerala leads the way in sedentary living and physical inactivity. Alcohol consumption and suicide rates are soaring and spending inequity is the nation’s highest.
Could this be India’s future? Some answers are available in prosperous communities and their islands of affluence across the nation. Similar reports have emerged — of soaring cancer and cardiac-disease rates, linked to changed lifestyles and other still-indeterminate links to polluted air, water, food, even ever-chaotic traffic.    
India now has a suicide rate that is among the world’s highest, according to a new WHO database. Many more people kill themselves in the more prosperous and urbanised southern states and, since 2012, more non-farmers have been committing suicide than farmers, suggesting mounting stress may accompany a better life for Indians.
Little wonder, a vague feeling of stress, ill-being and impatience appears to be spreading among Indians; perhaps, these feelings emerge in the form of ever-rising political expectations. After the UPA’s blunder-filled reign, which refused to adequately even address these expectations, Modi’s direct conversation about aspirations generates an almost euphoric voter response.
India is at an inflection point. Never has there been a greater yearning for progress. There is abundant talent, money and, possibly, political support for change. But it is imperative to carefully consider the kind of change unfolding to assess the hard indices against the soft. With the Planning Commission gone, it might not be a bad idea to consider a Commission for National Well-Being, which could study links between the government’s priorities — many on the right track — and others that should be.
For instance, reform of India’s vast, ramshackle health infrastructure is not among the government’s priorities. It should be — along with dodgy pollution-control and crumbling environmental protection processes. Few nations have progressed on the hard indices alone. Consider war-ravaged — and now fast-growing — Cambodia: In 1990, the maternal mortality rate (MMR) — a measure of the mothers who die per 100,000 live births —was 1,200, three times higher than India’s 560. By 2013, India’s MMR was down to 190, according to the WHO. Cambodia’s had dropped to 170.

Rupee weakens to 61.54 in early tradeRupee trading weak at 61.44

Mumbai, Oct 30:  
The rupee was trading weak by 9 paise at 61.45 against the dollar at 4.03 p.m. local time.
After opening weak by 19 paise at 61.54 in early trade due to dollar's gains against other currencies overseas, the domestic unit hovered in the range of 61.39 and 61.55 against the dollar in the afternoon trade.
Forex dealers said besides the dollar surging to a three-week high versus the yen after the US Federal Reserve ended its massive quantitative easing programme, fresh demand for the American unit from importers put pressure on the rupee.
The domestic currency had dipped three paise to end at over one-week low of 61.35 against the greenback yesterday on dollar demand from importers.

Fed ends bond buying  signals confidence in US economyHoward Schneider and Michael Flaherty     Washington   Last Updated: October 30, 2014  | 11:43 IST
(Photo: Reuters)
The United States Federal Reserve on Wednesday ended its monthly bond purchase program and signaled confidence the US economic recovery would remain on track despite signs of a slowdown in many parts of the global economy .
"The Committee continues to see sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing progress toward maximum employment in a context of price stability," the central bank's policy committee said in a statement following a two-day meeting.
The statement largely dismissed recent financial market volatility, dimming growth in Europe and a weak inflation outlook as headwinds that would do little to undercut progress toward the Fed's unemployment and inflation goals.
The Fed pointed to strengthening labor markets, saying that slack in labor markets was "gradually diminishing".
It retained its basic language regarding interest rates from recent statements, saying that rates would remain low for a "considerable time" following the end of the bond purchases in October.
The timing and pace of rate hikes would depend on incoming economic data, the US central bank said, new language that apparently earned the support of Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser and Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher, who dissented at the previous meeting.
On inflation, the US Fed acknowledged that lower energy prices and other forces were holding inflation down, but that overall the economy should progress toward the central bank's target of 2 per cent.
"The Committee judges that the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 per cent has diminished somewhat since early this year," the statement said.
Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota was the only dissent on the grounds that a downturn in inflation expectations meant the central bank should commit to keeping interest rates lower for longer.
The decision to shutter the bond-buying program was almost foregone. The monthly purchases had been steadily cut from US $85 billion to US $15 billion as part of the apex bank's gradual turn away from policies launched to fight the 2007-2009 recession and breathe more life into a tepid recovery.
The Fed will continue reinvesting the proceeds of securities that mature each month, meaning its more than US $4 trillion balance sheet will remain intact for the time being.

India ranks 7 in protecting minority investorsWorld Bank report finds India better at protecting minority investors than US, Japan
Mail Today Bureau     New Delhi   Last Updated: October 30, 2014  | 11:21 IST
(Photo: Reuters)
India is a much better destination for protecting minority investors and credit availability, but its position in terms of doing business has worsened to 142 globally this year, according to a World Bank report titled 'Doing Business 2015: Going Beyond Efficiency'.
In South Asia, the report said that India implemented the largest number of regulatory reforms in June 2013-June 2014 with 20 followed by Sri Lanka with 16. In terms of protection of minority investors and credit availability, India is at 7th and 36th places respectively compared to 34th and 28th last year. These are the only two categories (out of ten considered by World Bank ) where India is ranked among top 50 countries-a target set by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the overall ranking.
"India strengthened minority investor protections by requiring greater disclosure of conflicts of interest by Board members increasing the remedies available in case of prejudicial related party transactions and introducing additional safeguards for shareholders of privately held companies," the report states.
India is ahead of the US, Japan, France and Germany when it comes to protecting minority investors. New Zealand has topped the list and is followed by Hong Kong, Singapore, the UK and Malaysia. While Ireland has been ranked sixth place, India, Canada and Albania have jointly been placed at the seventh position.
Major countries ranked below India include France (17th), Korea and Italy (21st), the US (25th), Japan (35th), Germany (51st), Australia (71st) and Switzerland (78th). On ease of getting credit in India, the report said, "... in India a little over a decade ago, an entrepreneur seeking a loan to grow his business would have had little luck because financial institutions lacked access to information systems to assess creditworthiness. Today, thanks to the creation and expansion of a national credit bureau offering credit scores and coverage on par with those in some high-income economies, a small business in India with a good financial history is more likely to get credit and hire more workers."

Hyundai plans to take on Toyota with new hyb...Hyundai plans to take on Toyota's Prius with new hybrid model
By Reuters | 30 Oct, 2014, 12.28PM IST
Tweet
In addition to the Aslan, it aims to sell 32,000 of its Genesis vehicles - a somewhat more upmarket model, in South Korea, next year.
SEOUL: South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co said it is developing its first dedicated gas-electric car that would go up against Toyota Motor Corp's best-selling Prius.
The move will help it diversify its eco-friendly vehicle line-up and hedge its bets in next-generation green technology to meet stricter emission regulations in key markets.
More than other automakers, Hyundai has championed fuel-cell powered vehicles and this year began to sell what it says are the industry's first fuel cell models available to consumers, at three dealerships in California. It also plans to start selling its first battery-powered electric vehicle in 2016.
"We will take the lead in the future by raising the competitiveness of our environment-friendly cars like hybrid-only cars, plug-in hybrid cars and fuel cell hydrogen cars," Hyundai Motor CEO Kim Choong-ho said at a launch event for its Aslan premium sedan in South Korea.
Kim declined to provide details such as when the hybrid would be on the market.
The new vehicle will be Hyundai first "dedicated" hybrid - that is a vehicle designed to be marketed exclusively as a hybrid, rather than a variation of an existing gasoline model.
Ford Motor Co is also planning its first dedicated hybrid model, sources have told Reuters. The new compact car is expected to arrive as a 2019 model, roughly 21 years after the introduction of the original Prius in Japan.
Hyundai said it aims to sell 22,000 of its new Aslan large sedans in South Korea next year, hoping the domestic-focused model will help it fend off German rivals such as the Volkswagen Passat in its lucrative home market. It aims to sell 6,000 this year.
"The new model will help tighten our grip on the (domestic) premium car market," said Kim Sang-dae, director at Hyundai's Domestic Marketing Group.
In addition to the Aslan, it aims to sell 32,000 of its Genesis vehicles - a somewhat more upmarket model, in South Korea, next year.
The automaker is also looking at introducing the Aslan in China, the United States and Middle Eastern countries.

As Federal Reserve ends bond buys, Janet Yellen to expand influence

(When the Federal Reserve…)
WASHINGTON: When the Federal Reserve announced the end of its landmark bond buying program Wednesday, it also signaled the start of something else: The Janet Yellen era.
Officially, Yellen has been Fed chair since February. But the phase-out of the bond-buying stimulus program Yellen inherited from her predecessor, Ben Bernanke, truly marks her inauguration. She can now begin to fully stamp her influence on the central bank.
With the job market showing steady gains, Yellen must now grapple with the fateful decision of when to raise short-term interest rates, which the Fed has kept at record lows since 2008 to help the economy.
"Janet Yellen's ability to place her mark on the nation's monetary policy is only now opening up," said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West. "It will largely be Yellen" who guides rates back to their historic averages from near-zero levels.
Yellen will also preside over the unwinding of the Fed's vast portfolio of bonds, which its purchases have magnified to more than $4 trillion, a record high. The bond buying had been designed to keep long-term loan rates low.
Bernanke's tenure at the Fed was focused on bolstering the financial system and rescuing the economy. Yellen's will require a delicate balancing act to bring the Fed back to normal: She must withdraw the Fed's stimulus without destabilizing the economy.
"If we're moving to an era where things will become less accommodative, then we're in the Yellen era," said Jay Bryson, a global economist at Wells Fargo.
For Yellen and other Fed officials, the decision of when to begin raising rates toward their historic averages hinges on two major economic forces: Jobs and inflation.
A recent hot streak in job growth has shrunk the unemployment rate to 5.9 per cent from 7.2 per cent a year ago. Those gains suggest that the Fed may begin to lift rates earlier than expected.
In a statement it issued after ending a policy meeting Wednesday, the Fed noted that hiring is strengthening and that the excess of would-be job holders is "gradually diminishing." Accordingly, it must eventually withdraw its stimulus.
The statement's mention of "solid" job gains doesn't mean the economy has regained full strength in Yellen's eyes - particularly because pay growth has been all but flat and housing has lagged behind the rest of the recovery.
"There is a long way between saying that and the labor market is healthy," said Richard Moody, chief economist at Regions Financial.
Surges in hiring usually cause prices to rise, yet inflation has remained persistently below the Fed's 2 per cent target. Muted inflation suggests a weaker economy than indicated by the falling unemployment rate.
The Fed did reiterate its plan to maintain its benchmark short-term rate near zero "for a considerable time." Most economists predict the Fed won't raise that rate, which affects many consumer and business loans, before June.
But its confirmation that it would end its bond buying program and perhaps move closer to a rate increase suggested the start of a new period for the Fed.
On balance, economists saw the Fed's statement as showing less concern about unusually low inflation, which has helped delay a rate increase. Some analysts said the market reaction Wednesday indicated that investors saw the Fed statement as at least setting the stage for rate hikes starting sometime next year.
"The trick will be normalizing interest rates without creating another recession or unleashing higher inflation or adding to global financial instability and financial bubbles," Anderson said.
Michael Hanson, senior economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said the Fed still appears likely to put off any rate increase until at least mid-2015.
  "This isn't the Fed rushing to the exits," he said.
Hanson noted that while the Fed kept its "considerable time" phrasing, it added language stressing that any rate increase would hinge on the economy's health. Previously, many analysts had interpreted the "considerable time" phrase to mean the Fed wouldn't raise rates for a specific period after it ended its bond purchases.
The Fed's statement was approved 9-1. The one dissent came from Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Fed's regional bank in Minneapolis. He contended that the Fed should have signaled its intention to maintain a record-low benchmark rate until the inflation outlook has reached the central bank's 2 per cent target. And he argued that the Fed should have continued its bond purchases at the current pace.
Yellen has stressed that while the unemployment rate is close to a historically normal level, other gauges of the job market remain a concern. These include stagnant pay; many part-time workers who can't find full-time jobs; and a historically high number of people who have given up looking for a job and are no longer counted as unemployed.

Tech Mahindra rallies over 4% post Q2 resultsTech Mahindra rallies over 4% post Q2 results; top Nifty gainer
ECONOMICTIMES.COM Oct 30, 2014, 09.46AM IST
(Tech Mahindra reported…)
NEW DELHI: Tech Mahindra Ltd rose as much as 4.4 per cent in trade on Thursday after the India's fifth-largest software service company reported 14 per cent QoQ jump in consolidated net profit to Rs 720 crore for the quarter ended September 2014.
The IT major logged a net profit of Rs 631 crore in the previous quarter.
At 09:40 a.m.; Tech Mahindra was trading 4.1 per cent higher at Rs 2496 and was also the top gainer on the 50-share Nifty index. It hit a low of Rs 2450 and a high of Rs 2502.90 in trade today.
Tech Mahindra reported 5.2 per cent jump in second-quarter revenue sequentially, helped by growth in its enterprises segment. The company reported revenue of $900 million and a net profit of $118 million, up 12.2% sequentially.
EBITDA and EBIT margin of the company expanded by 187 bps and 218 bps q-o-q to 20 per cent and 17.4 per cent, respectively. This was on the back of absence of visa costs (which were there in Q1FY15), increase in utilization level to 73% (72% in Q1FY15) and rationalization of SG&A expenses.
Tech Mahindra is following a two-pronged strategy to expand its enterprise business - end-to-end offerings in leadership areas like manufacturing and niche offering-led entry strategy in areas like BFSI where it is a challenger.
"The revamped sales team post consolidation of Satyam and increased focus on sales efforts have started yielding results for the company with improving volume growth," says Ankita Somani, Research Analyst at MSFL Research.
"The commentary has turned confident furthermore as it witness demand traction in Telecom along with sustained momentum in Enterprise segment," she adds.

Samsung Q3 profit slumps 60.1% to over 3-yea...Profit for the mobile division, which drove Samsung's earnings growth in 2012 and 2013, shrank to 1.75 trillion won from 6.70 trillion won a year earlier. 
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
SEOUL: Samsung Electronics Co Ltd saw its July-September quarterly profit fall to the lowest level in more than three years, as a decline in earnings from its smartphone business set the South Korean giant on track for its worst year since 2011.
The global smartphone leader has lost market share in annual terms for the past two quarters, lagging behind Apple Inc
in the premium market and overtaken by rivals like Lenovo Group Ltd and Xiaomi Inc at the bottom end.
Samsung on Thursday said its third-quarter operating profit fell by an annual 60.1 percent to 4.1 trillion won ($3.90 billion), matching its guidance issued earlier this month and marking the weakest result since the second quarter of 2011.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, Samsung said it "cautiously expects an earnings increase, driven by strong seasonal demand for TVs and continued growth momentum for the memory business".
However it said the mobile division's outlook remained uncertain.
Analysts expect Samsung to record its weakest annual operating profit in three years despite the launch of new gadgets like the Galaxy Note 4 phablet.
A mean forecast from a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S survey of 41 analysts tips 2014 profit at 26.4 trillion won, down from last year's record 36.8 trillion won.
Profit for the mobile division fell to 1.75 trillion won in the third quarter from 6.70 trillion won a year ago, its worst performance since the second quarter of 2011.
Samsung spent most of the quarter without launching a new flagship device and continued to struggle in the mid-to-low tier markets.
While the Galaxy Note 4 launch in September and the expected release of new products in the low end of the market during the October-December quarter are seen lifting smartphone sales slightly, analysts say the days of record mobile profits for Samsung are over.
The firm will likely have to sacrifice margins to ensure it does not lose more market share. Cheaper phones are also expected to drive global smartphone market growth in coming years, meaning a general trend of lower average selling prices.
Samsung's chips division offered support, recording a 2.26 trillion operating profit for the July-September quarter to mark the highest earnings since the third quarter of 2010.
The flat-screen panels business ran a 60 billion won profit during the July-September period, compared with a 980 billion won profit a year earlier.

WhatsApp founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton own nearly $9 billion in Facebook stock

SAN FRANCISCO: WhatsApp founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton received 116 million shares of Facebook stock currently worth nearly $9 billion when they sold their unprofitable messaging service to the social networking leader earlier this month.
The breakdown of the big winners in Facebook Inc.'s $22 billion acquisition emerged Wednesday in a regulatory filing.
Koum, a Ukraine immigrant who was once living on welfare, reaped the biggest jackpot with 76.4 million Facebook shares now worth $5.8 billion. That makes him Facebook's fourth largest stockholder behind company CEO Mark Zuckerberg and two mutual funds, Fidelity Management and Vanguard.
Acton, who worked with Koum when they were both Yahoo Inc. engineers, owns 39.7 million Facebook shares worth $3 billion.
More than 45 other WhatsApp current and former employees also received Facebook stock. Wednesday's filing didn't specify how many shares most of the other employees received.
Besides the Facebook stock, Koum and Acton also were paid a large chunk of the $4.6 billion in cash that was included in the WhatsApp acquisition. The amount of cash that the WhatsApp founders received hasn't been disclosed.
Both Koum, 38, and Acton, 42, rank among the 200 richest people in the U.S., according to Forbes' rankings.
Koum remains WhatsApp's CEO and also sits on Facebook's board of directors. He is being paid an annual salary of just $1, but will receive an additional 24.9 million shares of Facebook stock that will vest during the next four years. That restricted stock is currently worth about $1.9 billion.
Although WhatsApp ranks among the world's most popular messaging apps, it hasn't turned a profit yet. The service lost $232.5 million on revenue of just $15 million during the first six months of this year, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. WhatsApp's revenue primarily comes from an annual subscription fee of 99 cents that kicks in after one year of free service.
Zuckerberg hasn't spelled out how WhatsApp will make money yet, a sign that Facebook intends to subsidize the service while it tries to expand its reach beyond its current 500 million users.
Some investors are worried about Facebook's rising costs to pay for the development of new services and employees picked up in acquisitions. Facebook expects its expenses to rise by as much as 75 percent next year, a rate that might outpace its revenue growth. That prospect rattled investors, causing Facebook's stock to shed $4.91, or 6 percent, to at $75.86 Wednesday. founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton received 116 million shares of Facebook stock currently worth nearly $9 billion when they sold their mobile messaging service to the social networking leader earlier this month.

Mumbai, Oct 30:  
Led by the recent economic reforms announced by the government, the benchmark BSE Sensex surged 248.16 points to end at a new closing peak of 27,346.33 and the NSE index Nifty rose 78.75 points at 8,169.20.
Domestic sentiment was buoyed on increased buying by investors as the recent economic reforms have instilled confidence that the country can better withstand potential rate hikes in the US.
Sectoral indices
All BSE sectoral indices ended in the green. Among them, realty index was the star-performer and was up 3.44 per cent, followed by IT 2.04 per cent, TECk 1.77 per cent and oil & gas 1.65 per cent.
Gainers, losers
Reliance, TCS, Hindalco, Infosys and GAIL were the top five gainers among 30-share Sensex constituents, while the top five losers were SSLT, M&M, Cipla, Tata Power and Hero MotoCorp.
FDI rules relaxed
Among the recent economic reforms, the Government had yesterday relaxed FDI rules in the construction sector by reducing the minimum built-up area as well as capital requirement and easing the exit norms. Sharess of realty companies, particularly those with high debt, such as Unitech, DLF and Puravankara climbed after the announcement.
Global markets
The dollar surged to a three-week high, bond yields rose and gold fell on Thursday after the US Federal Reserve ended its six-year quantitative easing bond-buying programme.
The decision was widely expected, but a relatively hawkish tone to the accompanying statement was not. It prompted financial markets to rethink the growing consensus that the Fed's first interest rate hike would be late in 2015.
Stock market reaction was more mixed. Asian shares mostly fell, following a slight decline on Wall Street overnight. European bourses opened higher on Thursday, helped by encouraging corporate earnings, but quickly turned negative.
Overnight borrowing costs
In a statement on Wednesday after a two-day meeting, the Fed retained its basic guidance that overnight borrowing costs would remain near zero for a "considerable time".
But it dropped a characterisation of the US labour market slack as "significant" in a show of confidence in the economy's prospects, which markets perceived as a slightly hawkish turn.
In early European trade the dollar index, a broad measure of the greenback's trade-weighted value, was up 0.5 percent above 86.4.
European equity markets initially welcomed the Fed's statement as a sign that the US economy is in good shape, rather than taking fright at the prospect of interest rates perhaps rising sooner than had been expected.
But at 0930 GMT the EuroFirst 300 index of leading shares was down 0.1 per cent at 1317 points. Germany's DAX was down 0.4 per cent and France's CAC40 was down 0.1 per cent, shrugging off upbeat corporate updates from Alcatel Lucent, Technip and Renault.
Britain's FTSE 100 was down 0.5 per cent, and U. futures pointed to Wall Street opening around 0.2 per cent lower.

Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka on Wednesday met IT and Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad to discuss how the Indian IT companies can be involved in the Rs 1 lakh crore Digital India programme.
"CEO of Infosys Vishal Sikka met me. We discussed more active participation of India Inc in Digital India," Prasad tweeted.
This was a follow-up meeting between the two after their first meeting on Digital India programme in Germany.
"The Minister in his visit to Germany had met Mr Sikka and impressed upon on him to work with government in rolling out Digital India programme which is a focus area of the Prime Minister, especially by involving small IT companies so that they benefit from this programme of the government," a Telecom Ministry official told PTI.
Under the Digital India programme, the government has envisaged to create various IT-based solutions, including delivery of services to public like health, education, financial services etc, secure email system for government officials and develop IT platform for sending messages.
The government has plans to spend Rs 200 crore for imparting IT training to 1 crore students over the next 5 years.
"The Minister also asked Mr Sikka to spread the intention of the new government in attracting foreign investment to Make in India and to motivate the potential investors to set up industries, especially in Electronics Manufacturing in India," the official said.

US Federal Reserve ends bond buying programHoward Schneider and Michael Flaherty     Washington   Last Updated: October 30, 2014  | 11:43 IST
(Photo: Reuters)
The United States Federal Reserve on Wednesday ended its monthly bond purchase program and signaled confidence the US economic recovery would remain on track despite signs of a slowdown in many parts of the global economy .
"The Committee continues to see sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing progress toward maximum employment in a context of price stability," the central bank's policy committee said in a statement following a two-day meeting.
The statement largely dismissed recent financial market volatility, dimming growth in Europe and a weak inflation outlook as headwinds that would do little to undercut progress toward the Fed's unemployment and inflation goals.
The Fed pointed to strengthening labor markets, saying that slack in labor markets was "gradually diminishing".
It retained its basic language regarding interest rates from recent statements, saying that rates would remain low for a "considerable time" following the end of the bond purchases in October.
The timing and pace of rate hikes would depend on incoming economic data, the US central bank said, new language that apparently earned the support of Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser and Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher, who dissented at the previous meeting.
On inflation, the US Fed acknowledged that lower energy prices and other forces were holding inflation down, but that overall the economy should progress toward the central bank's target of 2 per cent.
"The Committee judges that the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 per cent has diminished somewhat since early this year," the statement said.
Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota was the only dissent on the grounds that a downturn in inflation expectations meant the central bank should commit to keeping interest rates lower for longer.
The decision to shutter the bond-buying program was almost foregone. The monthly purchases had been steadily cut from US $85 billion to US $15 billion as part of the apex bank's gradual turn away from policies launched to fight the 2007-2009 recession and breathe more life into a tepid recovery.
The Fed will continue reinvesting the proceeds of securities that mature each month, meaning its more than US $4 trillion balance sheet will remain intact for the time being.

India 7th best in protecting minority investors: World BankWorld Bank report finds India better at protecting minority investors than US, Japan
Mail Today Bureau     New Delhi   Last Updated: October 30, 2014  | 11:21 IST
(Photo: Reuters)
India is a much better destination for protecting minority investors and credit availability, but its position in terms of doing business has worsened to 142 globally this year, according to a World Bank report titled 'Doing Business 2015: Going Beyond Efficiency'.
In South Asia, the report said that India implemented the largest number of regulatory reforms in June 2013-June 2014 with 20 followed by Sri Lanka with 16. In terms of protection of minority investors and credit availability, India is at 7th and 36th places respectively compared to 34th and 28th last year. These are the only two categories (out of ten considered by World Bank ) where India is ranked among top 50 countries-a target set by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the overall ranking.
"India strengthened minority investor protections by requiring greater disclosure of conflicts of interest by Board members increasing the remedies available in case of prejudicial related party transactions and introducing additional safeguards for shareholders of privately held companies," the report states.
India is ahead of the US, Japan, France and Germany when it comes to protecting minority investors. New Zealand has topped the list and is followed by Hong Kong, Singapore, the UK and Malaysia. While Ireland has been ranked sixth place, India, Canada and Albania have jointly been placed at the seventh position.
Major countries ranked below India include France (17th), Korea and Italy (21st), the US (25th), Japan (35th), Germany (51st), Australia (71st) and Switzerland (78th). On ease of getting credit in India, the report said, "... in India a little over a decade ago, an entrepreneur seeking a loan to grow his business would have had little luck because financial institutions lacked access to information systems to assess creditworthiness. Today, thanks to the creation and expansion of a national credit bureau offering credit scores and coverage on par with those in some high-income economies, a small business in India with a good financial history is more likely to get credit and hire more workers."

The school started off in 1958 under a thatched roof and the government lent Mrs Y.G. Partharasarathy four grounds in Nungambakkam (where the school still stands today) on a 15-year-lease.
“I had to collect funds to build semi-thatched class rooms with honeycomb bricks as walls,” recalls the school’s dean and director, in an e-mail, “Those days, it cost Rs 5,000 per class room. I had successfully approached quite a few film stars like M.G.R., Shivaji, Savithri, S.S.Rajendran and so on. S.S. Rajendran told me that he was himself building the house and so he could not give me the money but he would donate 5000 bricks instead.”
The actor, who passed away last Friday, was well known for his Tamil pronounciation. He played the role of Kovalan in Poompuhar, the dialogues of which were penned by Karunanidhi, and has acted in over 75 films.

air and space accident
This is the first catastrophic launch in NASA’s commercial spaceflight effort
An unmanned commercial supply rocket bound for the International Space Station exploded moments after liftoff Tuesday evening, with debris falling in flames over the launch site in Virginia. No injuries were reported following the first catastrophic launch in NASA’s commercial spaceflight effort.
The accident at Orbital Sciences Corp.’s launch complex at Wallops Island was sure to draw criticism over the space agency’s growing reliance on private U.S. companies in this post-shuttle effort.
NASA is paying billions of dollars to Orbital Sciences and the SpaceX company to make station deliveries, and it’s counting on SpaceX and Boeing to start flying U.S. astronauts to the orbiting lab as early as 2017. NASA spokesman Rob Navias said there was nothing on the lost flight that was urgently needed by the six people living on the space station.
Orbital Sciences’ Antares rocket blew up over the launch complex, just six seconds after the liftoff. The company said everyone at the site had been accounted for, and the damage appeared to be limited to the facilities.
Flames could be seen shooting into the sky as the sun set. There was no hint of any trouble until the rocket exploded. This was the second launch attempt for the mission. Monday evening’s try was thwarted by a stray sailboat in the rocket’s danger zone. The restrictions are in case of just such an accident that occurred Tuesday.
“We will understand what happened hopefully soon and we’ll get things back on track,” Orbital Sciences’ executive vice president Frank Culbertson told his team an hour after the failure. “We’ve all seen this happen in our business before, and we’ve all seen the teams recover from this, and we will do the same.”
The roomful of engineers and technicians were ordered to maintain all computer data for the ensuing investigation. Culbertson advised his staff not to talk to news reporters and to refrain from speculating among themselves.
“Definitely do not talk outside of our family,” said Culbertson, a former astronaut who once served on the space station.
It was the fourth Cygnus bound for the orbiting lab; the first flew just over a year ago. SpaceX is scheduled to launch another Dragon supply ship from Cape Canaveral in December.
The Cygnus cargo ship Tuesday had held 5,000 pounds (2,267 kilograms) of experiments and equipment. By coincidence, the Russian Space Agency was proceeding with its own supply run on Wednesday, planned well before the U.S. mishap.
All the scientists and students behind the science experiments aboard the Cygnus were surely devastated. About one—third of the capsule’s contents involved research. Among the instruments that were lost- a meteor tracker and 32 mini research satellites, along with numerous experiments compiled by schoolchildren.
The two Americans, three Russians and one German on the orbiting lab were informed promptly of the accident.
Until Tuesday, all of the supply missions by the Virginia—based Orbital Sciences and California—based SpaceX had been near—flawless.
President Barack Obama has long championed this commercial effort, urging that NASA focus its human spaceflight effort less on nearby orbit and more on destinations like asteroids and Mars. He was in Wisconsin for a campaign rally Tuesday evening and was kept abreast of the accident and its developments.
SpaceX’s billionaire founder and chief officer Elon Musk whose company is the face, in many ways, of the commercial effort said he was sorry to learn about the failure. “Hope they recover soon,” he said in a tweet.
Support poured in from elsewhere in the space community late Tuesday night.
“We are with you OrbitalSciences and NASA,” former NASA astronaut Leland Melvin said via Twitter.
“Very sorry to see the Antares rocket launch failure,” said Chris Hadfield, a former Canadian astronaut who served as space station commander last year. “Spaceflight is hard. Very glad that no one was hurt. Now time to sort out why & effects.”
John Logdson, former space policy director at George Washington University, said it was unlikely to be a major setback to NASA’s commercial space plans. But he noted it could derail Orbital Sciences for a while given the company has just one launch pad and the accident occurred right above it.
“It shows the wisdom of having more than one source” for launches, Logsdon said. Nevertheless, he added, “This is going to put the logistics chain for the station under some stress for a period of time.”
U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat who flew on a space shuttle right before the 1986 Challenger disaster, said in a statement, “Space flight is inherently risky. As we push the frontiers of space there will be setbacks. But our commercial space ventures will ultimately be successful.”
The explosion also hit Orbital Science’s stock, which fell more than 15 percent in after—hours trading.

Officials from L&T and Gujarat government exchange work order document for ``Statue of Unity" project in the presence of Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel in Gandhinagar on Monday
Gujarat awards Rs 2,979 cr work order for the project 
Gandhinagar, Oct 27:  
The Gujarat government on Monday issued work order for construction of the Statue of Unity – World’s tallest statue in the riverbed of Narmada near Kevadia in Gujarat to the engineering major Larsen & Toubro (L& T). The work order is worth Rs 2,979 crore.
Conceptualised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his tenure as Chief Minister of the state, the Statue of Unity project involves construction of 182-metre tall statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. The project was announced by Modi on October 31, 2013, the birth anniversary of the 'Iron Man of India’.
 
The work order was handed over by the state government officials to the L&T officials in the presence of Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel here on Monday.
Speaking on the occasion Patel stated that the project will play an important role in socio-economic development of the tribal region, where the project is being taken up.
 
“This will help boost eco-tourism and development for the local community. Such mammoth project will also generate local employment for the people in Kevadia,” Patel told media persons here.
 
Of the total contract of Rs 2,979 crore, Rs 1,347 crore will go towards building the statue, Rs 235 crore for constructing the exhibition centre and convention centre, Rs 134 crore for research and development centres and Rs 83 crore for building the bridge connecting memorial with the mainland. The construction will take place on the Sadhu bet – an island approximately 3.5 km south of Sardar Sarovar Dam at Kevadia.
 
As per the terms of agreement, L&T will be responsible for maintenance and management of the project site for 15 year after the completion of construction. L&T will be paid Rs 657 crore for the same. The construction of the statue is likely to be completed in the next 42 months.
 
In the first phase, construction of the main statue, the bridge connecting the statue with the river bank and reconstruction of the 12-kms road along the bank will be taken up.
 
The entire project involves the main statue, a memorial park at the base of the statue, an artificial reservoir between the Dam and Garudeshwar town, a visitor facilitation centre and a reception desk at Kevadia.
 
The total height of the statue from the base (or reduce level) will be 240 metres, which includes base level of 58 metres. The statue will be double the size of 'Statue of Liberty' in US and four times that of 'Christ the Redeemer' in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Trial in Aircel-Maxis case
A special court trying the 2G spectrum case on Wednesday issued summons to former Telecom Minister Dayanidhi Maran, his brother Kalanithi Maran and six others in the Aircel-Maxis case.
The accused have been summoned on March 2, 2015 to enable the CBI to serve the summons as five of them live overseas.
“I have carefully gone through the copy of the FIR, charge sheet, statement of witnesses and related documents comprised in the voluminous record of the case. On perusal of the record, I am satisfied that there is enough incriminating material on record to proceed against the accused. Accordingly, I take cognisance of the case,” Mr. Saini said in his two-page order.
The court had on October 13 reserved an order on taking cognisance of the charge sheet after hearing the prosecution. The CBI counsel had argued that prima facie a case was made out against all the accused.

Tribunal to Hear DLF s Plea Against Sebi Order TodayAviation Regulator Acts Tough Against Troubled SpiceJet: Report
Mumbai: The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) will on Thursday hear an appeal against the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) by realty giant DLF, which has sought an interim relief for redeeming funds locked in mutual funds and other instruments.
Earlier this month, Sebi barred the company and six others, including the company's top executives, from accessing the capital market for three years for "active and deliberate suppression" of material information at the time of its IPO over seven years ago.
Following the Sebi order, the company moved to SAT, which last week sought Sebi's reply on DLF's plea for an interim relief. Sebi has been asked to give its reply by Thursday.
During the first hearing on October 22, the company sought an interim relief from the tribunal, while Sebi faced the flak for delay in passing the order and also for the adverse impact suffered by shareholders, who lost over Rs 7,500 crore of their wealth in a single day post the order.
While promoters own 74.93 per cent stake in DLF, foreign institutional investors have close to 20 per cent and retail shareholders have about 4 per cent among others.
This was one of the rare orders by Sebi where it barred a blue-chip firm and its top promoter/executives from market. DLF's initial public offer in 2007 had fetched Rs 9,187 crore - the biggest IPO in the country at that time.
As the case progresses, the industry experts are of the opinion that the case will have wider ramifications for the entire real estate sector and the regulatory framework applicable to them.
Top executives from real estate sector and capital markets intermediaries have said the case needs to be seen in a different perspective from those pertaining to sectors other than real estate.
At the same time, the role of merchant bankers, legal advisors and others involved in the process of making IPO-related disclosures also needs to be examined, they said.
The case has also brought to limelight 'technicalities' involved in the practice of Sebi giving 'observations' and not 'approval or clearance' for an IPO.
There is a view that regulators need to understand that the business practices tend to be different in real estate sector, from manufacturing or other segments of the economy.
However, others feel that regulations cannot be overlooked to accommodate certain 'prevailing practices' in one particular sector, such as those related to use of 'friendly' entities for purchase of land or development rights in the name of ease of doing business.

Joint committees of officials of forest department and power distribution company SOUTHCO would be formed to curb deaths of wild elephants due to electrocution in four districts of south Odisha.
This was decided on Tuesday at a joint meeting of the forest department and SOUTHCO authorities in Berhampur. This meeting was chaired by regional chief conservator of forests (RCCF) Jitendra Kumar and was attended by authorities of the power distribution company, divisional forest officers (DFO) of Berhampur, North Ghumusar, South Ghumusar, Phulbani, Baliguda, Boudh and Paralakhemundi. These forest divisions are located in Ganjam, Kandhamal, Boudh and Gajapati districts.
Speaking to newsmen, RCCF Mr Kumar said with emphasis on rural electrification, danger of electrocution of wild elephants has increased as the high voltage power cables pass through forests. At times, elephants come in contact with the low hanging high voltage power supply cables, said the RCCF.

Organ trade  missing piece in Nithari puzzleUpdated: October 29, 2014 01:23 IST
Organ trade, missing piece in Nithari puzzle?
Usha Ramanathan
crime, law and justice
There can be no closure in the Nithari case till the connection between missing children and organ trade is further investigated
It is no longer a secret that thousands of children go “missing” every year and that Delhi has an extraordinarily high incidence of missing children. In August 2012, the Minister of State for Home Affairs, responding to a question, said in the Rajya Sabha, “NCRB [National Crime Records Bureau] data registers that a child goes missing every eight minutes. About 40 per cent of these children remain missing.”
Who are these children? In 2010, the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights set it out in some detail. It said: “Of the 2,503 missing children in Delhi, 760 are from North-East Delhi, 572 are from East Delhi, 354 from West Delhi, 242 from North-West Delhi, 225 from Central Delhi, 130 from North Delhi, and 230 from Outer Delhi. In Sangam Vihar alone, more than 112 children had been reported missing… The maximum number of children reported missing was from areas where people from economically weaker section reside.”
Till a few years ago, it was understood that children ran away from home as they were pushed to the edge by extreme poverty or violence at home. However, it has been acknowledged for some years now that a sizeable number of those who go missing are trafficked for prostitution, slavery and beggary.
Registering complaints
The Nithari episode reveals how little we know. In Nithari village in Noida, Uttar Pradesh, the police refused to register complaints in 2005 and 2006 by parents of missing children. Remains of these children were found later near the house of businessman Moninder Singh Pandher. Both Pandher and his domestic servant Surinder Koli were arrested and Koli was given the death sentence by the Supreme Court for murdering one of the children, 14-year-old Rimpa Haldar. On October 28, the court dismissed Koli’s review plea against his death sentence.
“Children disappeared in Nithari even after Koli had been arrested; the MWCD report speaks of this”
When we visited Nithari with a team of students to understand what took place there, parents spoke of their helplessness when the police refused to register their complaints. These families largely comprised migrant workers. Some of them, Bengali speaking, said they were told that they were ‘Bangladeshis’ and the law would be used against them if they persisted with their complaints. This clearly shows that registering a complaint of a missing child is itself not a straightforward task. Take the case of Rimpa for instance. Her parents say she went missing in February 2005. In July that year, her father filed a missing person’s report which was then entered in the ‘general diary’ in the police station. It was not until the disappearance of another girl, Payal, in 2006, and when skulls and bones and clothes were found, that a storm was raised in Nithari. Only then were the complaints of the missing children’s parents taken seriously. The FIR in Rimpa’s case was registered in 2007, close to two years after she went missing.
In January 2007, a committee was set up by the Ministry of Women and Child Development to probe all that was emerging from the drains of Nithari. The committee observed “police apathy and indifference to the reports of missing children.” It was surprised that despite reports that a number of children who went missing were from one locality, the police “were in the dark.” It felt that the police’s apathy may have been because “many of the victims’ families came from poorer sections of society.”
The organ trade angle
A second scary possibility was raised in the report and was indicated in passing in the Allahabad High Court’s judgment. Only skull and bones were found together, the report stated, while “the flesh of the torso was disposed of separately from the rest of the body.
In fact, this portion of the bodies has only been discovered after a thorough search carried out under [the] CBI’s supervision.” The motive for this is yet to be found. The committee suggested that “the CBI should look into all angles including organ trade ... [and] there is a need to study the organ transplant records of all hospitals in Noida over the last few years to study the pattern and trend of these operations and trace the donors and recipients.”
Was this anxiety about organ trading followed through? Was something found? There is no saying. What we only know is that in Paragraph 52 of the High Court’s judgment, there is a reference to a prosecution witness who deposes that a doctor, who was a resident in the house adjoining the house in which Koli is said to have committed the crimes, had been arrested in 1997 “in some kidney scam matter.” The construction of Koli as a cannibal has wiped out all other images from our minds understandably; yet, is there more to it than meets the eye? What was done to follow up on the purpose for which the torsos had been severed from the skull, and which suggested organ trade?
Rimpa Haldar’s case is the first among many cases in the Nithari murders. V. Venkatesan writing in Frontline has cited a 2007 report in Amar Ujala that says Rimpa may not be among the dead, but may have run away, got married and moved to Nepal. That too will have to be investigated. And then there are still the rest of the victims. Further, children disappeared in Nithari even after Koli had been arrested; the MWCD report speaks of this. There are also questions on who else was involved and what was done with the torsos of the missing children. Koli has been implicated in the other murders too. The Supreme Court has, gratuitously, while confirming the death sentence on Koli for the death of Rimpa, referred to him as a serial killer. We are unlikely to know if he is indeed one till the other cases go to trial.
But that a connection between missing children and organ trade has cropped up in this case is indubitable. Till this is investigated and we know what is found, there can be no closure in the Nithari case.

State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has edged past Reliance Industries to become the highest ranked Indian energy firm on this year's Platts Global 250 Rankings.
ONGC , which in 2013 was ranked 22nd, improved one position in this year's ranking that is led by global giants Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell.
RIL, India's largest private firm, slipped from 19th rank in 2013 to 22nd in this year's ranking, according to Platts.
Indian Oil Corp , the nation's largest oil refiner and fuel marketing firm, made a huge jump to break into top 50 global energy firms club. It has improved from 80th rank in 2013 to 43rd in this year's ranking that were released last evening.
Coal India, the world's largest coal producer, slipped four places to settle at 47 in this year's ranking.
Power utility NTPC slipped one place to 50th this year.
Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) made the biggest leap when it jumped from 119th rank last year to 66th in this year's edition. Gas utility GAIL also improved its ranking from 105 to 97.
Cairn India improved five positions to settle at 104th in the top-250 ranking where Oil India Ltd, the nation's second largest state explorer, and Essar Oil debuted at 208th and 232nd positions, respectively.

Each company listed in the Platts Top 250 has distinguished itself through its remarkable performance and the outstanding efforts and dedication of its team in the previous year," Platts said.
It used four key metrics-asset worth, revenues, profits, and return on invested capital, to assess the energy companies' financial performance.
Essar Oil has been ranked as the 16th fastest growing company in the world with a 27.9 per cent Compounded Growth Rate (CGR) in last three years.
Cairn India is 25th on the list with 22.2 per cent CGR. GAIL is ranked 32nd with 20.5 per cent CGR on the list, which also has RIL at 46th position with 17.8 per cent CGR.

"All companies on the (Global 250) list have assets greater than $5 billion. The fundamental and market data comes from a database compiled and maintained by S&P Capital IQ, a business unit of McGraw Hill Financial," Platts said.

The study by market research consultancy Spire Research and Consulting showed that 54 per cent of businesses reported more than 20 per cent increase in revenues after establishing their online presence.
The study titled 'India's E-Tailing Industry - Seller's Perspective' 2014 was unveiled in New Delhi on Wednesday.
It focuses on the trend of online shopping and its impact on sellers. The survey had a sample size of 300 retailers, of which 100 each were from apparel, consumer electronics and food sectors across 13 states.
Japnit Singh, Senior Director, Spire Research and Consulting, Singapore and India, said, "The country is one of the fastest-growing markets for e-commerce globally. The research clearly shows sellers in India have a positive sentiment towards e-commerce with maximum traction seen in apparel and food businesses. This study indicates a growing trend towards adoption of online channels. Over 50 per cent of businesses currently account for significant revenue share from online sales with revenue shares set to rise significantly over the next five years."
The study also revealed that a majority of businesses have accepted online platforms as an extension of their brands.
Businesses in the apparel (82 per cent) and food (80 per cent) sectors seem to have an advantage by going online as compared to consumer electronics (72 per cent). Moreover, consumer electronics seem to have a lower potential as consumers are inclined to be more involved in the purchasing process.
The study indicated the share of online revenue is set to grow. Currently, a majority of business are attributing 20 per cent to 50 per cent of their revenue by online sales.
Saurabh Sharma, Country Manager for Spire Research & Consulting India, said, "Sellers will follow a dual strategy combining both offline and online channels with significant sales still coming from the familiar offline channels. A majority of the sellers surveyed perceive physical stores as a more profitable channel of sales compared to online marketplaces."
The report also said 91 per cent sellers have been associated with online marketplaces for less than three years across all categories, and 60 per cent for one year only.
Key findings:
1. Over 54 per cent of businesses have reported a growth of more than 20 per cent since establishing an online presence.
2. Apparel and food businesses saw a larger benefit of going online.
3. Other industries with a fragmented structure and low barriers to entry will also see growth in the industry. Baby products, books, home dÃ©cor and jewellery may also benefit from e-tailing.
4. Consumer durables (such as electronics) may see a lower potential as customer may prefer to be more involved in the purchasing process.    
5. Most businesses use a combination strategy with 31 per cent businesses reporting between 20 and 50 per cent of their sales coming via online. This trend is expected to continue, but the proportion may grow to 45 per cent.
6. Apparel business may also see a larger opportunity to increase share of online business, while food may continue to be offline.
7. Tier-2 and tier-3 cities may see a faster adoption and greater share coming from online channels.
8. The key challenge remaining are payment mechanisms and the risk of cash on delivery, challenges in logistics and order fulfillment.

TCS only Indian firm in 50 most innovative cosTCS only Indian firm in top 50 most innovative cos: Boston Consulting Group's list
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: October 29, 2014  | 22:30 IST
Country's largest software services exporter Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) was the only Indian company found place in the Boston Consulting Group's global list of top 50 most innovative firms this year.
Technology giant Apple topped the chart, followed by Google, Samsung, Microsoft and IBM as the most innovative companies globally in the list of the global management consulting firm. TCS secured the 43rd position in the list.
Apart from telecom and technology firms, car makers Tesla Motors, Toyota and BMW as well as firms like Nike, Shell, Airbus and McDonald's also featured among the top 50.
BCG has surveyed more than 1,500 senior executives in a wide range of countries and industries since 2004 to help cast light on the state of innovation in global business.
The report examined the factors that separate breakthrough innovators from other companies.
It found that breakthrough innovators are strong innovators first-they excel at the fundamentals that define successful innovation programmes.
They also cast a wider net for ideas, use business model innovation more and they have cultures geared toward breakthrough success, it added.
Almost half of breakthrough innovators reported generating more than 30 per cent of sales from innovations over the past three years, more than twice the average for all companies, it said.
BCG asked respondents to name up-and-coming companies that are still relatively young or have yet to reach the scale of the top 50 global giants but are making themselves known for innovation. Companies like WhatsApp, Square, Rakuten and Wipro lead this list.
"Innovation isn't getting any easier. Too many companies want to shoot for the moon while their innovation programmes are barely airborne. It is no longer enough to be good at incremental innovation," BCG Senior Partner and Director Neeraj Aggarwal said.
Breakthrough innovators are especially effective at bringing together the pieces required for radical innovation such as management, governance and organisational design that can have a major impact on any company's innovation programme, he added.
The survey found only 13 per cent respondents saying they have a significant ambition to deliver radical innovation.

Logistics firms to see boost from e-commerceSumeet Chatterjee and Tripti Kalro     Mumbai/Bangalore   Last Updated: October 30, 2014  | 12:22 IST

From Japan's richest man to Jeff Bezos, everyone wants a piece of the country's booming e-retail sector. For those without billions to pump into the tightly held firms who dominate the e-commerce segment, the best bet may be the delivery men.
On Tuesday, SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son joined Bezos' Amazon.com in pledging heavy investment in the domestic e-commerce industry, which is worth US $10 billion and is seen quadrupling in five years. Son bought stake in Snapdeal, the country's third-largest online marketplace.
Yet the little-known firms that deliver goods ordered online are already raking in rocketing earnings from online retail in the country, which has the world's third-biggest Internet user base, and they are listed. Shares in companies like Transport Corp of India and Gati have surged more than three-quarters in 2014 as industry watchers seek a chance to invest.
"When you see the limitless growth in the e-commerce sector, you do want to get involved," said Eric Mookherjee, a Paris-based fund manager at Shanti India, whose holdings include Transport Corp. "The next Alibaba or Tencent can be created in a country whose population is roughly similar to China. You will get that in India."
Nomura, the financial holdings company, estimated in a research note in July that the country's e-commerce industry could more than quadruple to US $43 billion over the next five years, driven by online retail.
Pledging to invest US $10 billion in the domestic e-retail segment in the next 10 years, SoftBank's Son on Tuesday said Snapdeal has the potential to become the country's Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant that was recently listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Son is well placed to know: his fast-growing Japanese telecom and media empire is the biggest Alibaba investor.
DELIVERY OUTSOURCING A MUST
Son's move comes after the country's two biggest online retailers, the home-grown startup Flipkart.com, and Amazon's domestic business, began spending billions of dollars to secure a bigger share of the market. Though the country's Internet population is huge, e-commerce infrastructure remains relatively under-developed and ripe for huge growth.
The forecasts for future expansion, and a key role in it for third-party delivery firms, have helped push the more than $50 billion domestic logistics sector, including Gati and Transport Corp, about 80 per cent higher so far in 2014. That makes it the country's fifth-best performing major industry by the Thomson Reuters StarMine classification.
Earnings are also ramping up. Net income of Blue Dart Express and Transport Corp is expected to jump by 37 per cent and 24 per cent in this fiscal year respectively, according to Thomson Reuters' SmartEstimates, which place an emphasis on recent forecasts by top-rated analysts.
In comparison, net profit of the 30 companies in the benchmark Sensex index of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) is expected to rise just 15 per cent on average.
As the market surges, competition for customers among e-commerce firms will see them seek to cut delivery times and expand into smaller cities. While Amazon and Snapdeal use both in-house logistics networks and external service providers, new services will see them relying increasingly on outsourcing.
"Amazon is today advertising 24-hour delivery and that's where people like us come in," said Areef Patel, executive vice-chairman of Patel Integrated Logistics, which serves Amazon India. The 24-hour delivery offer applies only to select postal codes and is not available across the country.
"We are looking to get e-commerce market share today because that's the flavour of the day," he said. Patel said his logistics firm aims to increase the portion of revenue it generates from e-commerce companies to 20-25 per cent within two to three years from the current value of 5 per cent.
With more than 45 per cent of Amazon's orders in the country coming from outside the top eight cities in the country, the company is looking to work with more logistics partners, Amazon India said.
"The biggest advantage of working with specialist logistics firms is the wide reach that they provide," said Ashish Chitravanshi, vice-president of operations at Snapdeal, speaking before the SoftBank investment was announced.

Moving in an opposite direction to stocks, the rupee on Thursday fell for the fourth day, dipping 10 paise to close at two-week low of 61.45 against the Greenback after US Federal Reserve kept in place its plans to maintain record low interest rate for some more time.
While the Fed's bond buying programme came to an end as expected, the continuation of ultra low interest rate regime lifted the dollar overseas against major currencies, thereby keeping the rupee under pressure, a forex dealer said.
At the Interank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market, the domestic unit commenced sharply lower at 61.52 a dollar from previous close of 61.35. It later moved in a narrow range of 61.39 and 61.55 before concluding at 61.45, showing a fall of 10 paise or 0.21 per cent.
In four days, the rupee has dipped by 21 paise or 0.37 per cent to end at its weakest level since October 16 (61.83).
The Indian benchmark S&P BSE Sensex on Thursday spurted by 248.16 points, or 0.92 per cent, to end at all-time high of 27,346.33. FIIs bought shares worth USD 123.13 million on Wednesday, as per Sebi data.
The dollar index was trading higher by 0.26 per cent against its major global rivals after Fed Wednesday made official its plans to end the last round of its recession-era stimulus programme while reiterating its stance of keeping its interest rate low.
Pramit Brahmbhatt, Veracity Group CEO said: "Rupee traded weak as month-end dollar demand from importers. However, rupee trimmed its initial losses on good foreign capital inflows into equity market....The trading range for the Spot USD/INR pair is expected to be within 60.90 to 61.90."
The depreciation of the rupee was limited as investors believe that the Indian markets have been performing fairly better than other countries, said Suresh Nair, Director, Admisi Forex India Pvt Ltd.

The benchmark Sensex on Thursday surged about 248 points to end at record closing peak of 27,346.33 on across-the-board buying by investors after government eased rules for FDI in construction sector and US Federal Reserve reiterated its plan to keep interest rates at record lows.
While BSE Sensex on Thurday surpassed both its intra-day high and closing high logged on September 8, NSE Nifty barometer hit a new intra-day peak of 8,181.55 but ended at 8,169.20 just a few notches below its record closing peak of 8,173.90.
Prominent gainers which lifted key indices to record highs include RIL, Infosys, L&T, Maruti Suzuki, HDFC Bank, Hindalco, HDFC, GAIL, Dr Reddys, ITC, NTPC, TCS.
"Markets have been on an upward trajectory on the back of renewed vigor shown by government to initiate reforms, lower crude prices and supportive global cues among others. Though Quantitative Easing ended, but Fed keeping the 'considerable period of time' stance for raising rates until it sees more improvement in the economy, cheered markets," said Devang Mehta, Sr VP & Head - Equity Advisory, Anand Rathi Financial.
After opening in positive terrain, the 30-share Sensex continued its upward march and soared to hit intra-day record high of 27,390.60, surpassing its earlier peak of 27,354.99 hit on September 8. The Sensex closed with a gain of 248.16 points, or 0.92 per cent, at new closing peak of 27,346.33, bettering earlier record close of 27,319.85 (September 8).
The 50-share NSE Nifty jumped by 78.75 points, or 0.97 per cent, to end at 8,169.20, after touching a new intra-day high of 8,181.55 that crossed previous record high of 8180.20.
Brokers said sentiments turned extremely bullish after the government had yesterday relaxed rules for FDI in the construction sector by reducing minimum built-up area as well as capital requirement and easing the exit norms. DLF, Unitech and HDIL shares rose in the range of 1.5-6 per cent.
"The equity markets were seen rejoicing. After a flat start, sentiments got some support from positive FII figure of the last session. However, gains remained capped as investors opted to book profits in last half an hour of the session as October derivative contracts were set to expire."
Sectorwise the BSE Realty index gained the most by rising 3.44 per cent, followed by IT index 2.04 per cent. Teck Index rose by 1.77 per cent, Oil and Gas index by 1.65 per cent, Consumer Durable index by 1.59 per cent, Capital Goods by 0.94 per cent and Bankex by 0.72 per cent.

New Delhi, Oct 30:  
Gold prices moved down by 0.75 per cent to Rs 26,876 per 10 grams at the futures trade today as speculators trimmed positions in tandem with a weak global trend where the precious metal traded near three-weak low.
On the Multi Commodity Exchange, gold for delivery in December fell Rs 203 or 0.75 per cent to Rs 26,876 per 10 grams in a business turnover of 1,067 lots.
In a similar fashion, the metal for delivery in February moved down by Rs 186 or 0.68 per cent to Rs 27,114 per kg in 18 lots.
Market analysts attributed the fall in gold futures to a weak global trend where the metal traded near a three-week low as the dollar strengthened after the Federal Reserve ended its asset-purchase programme.
Meanwhile, gold traded lower by 0.02 per cent to $1,211.30 an ounce in Singapore.

Property prices likely to remain stable: surveyProperty prices likely to remain stable: survey
PTI
Tweet
Mumbai, Oct 30:  
Even as the overall sentiment in the real estate sector has improved, buyers feel property prices across top 10 cities are likely to remain stable for the next six months, according to a recent survey.
The Housing Sentiment Index (HSI) assessed by IIM Bangalore and real estate portal Magicbricks home buyers across 10 cities — Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, Gurgaon, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai, Noida and Pune — suggests that real estate prices are likely to remain stable over the next six months.
The aggregate HSI measured across the cities dropped marginally by four per cent during July-September quarter to 114 compared to April-June period, indicating property prices would remain static.
“The Indian real estate consumer is still in the wait and watch mode. While there is active interest in the market, evinced by the time spent by consumers on Magicbricks searching for houses, the consumer still expects prices to hold for at least six months and is willing to wait to buy,” Magicbricks Business Head Sudhir Pai said.
As per the survey, sentiment in Ahmedabad soared by 30 per cent and can be attributed to the progressive policies and intelligent governance that led to mushrooming of various industries, the report said.
“The fact that the current reform-focused Prime Minister Narendra Modi hails from Ahmedabad has assisted in the heightened positive atmosphere in the city,” Pai said.
Pune was the only city beside Ahmedabad to register higher sentiments this quarter, while Hyderabad posted an HSI of 104, a drop of 12 per cent as compared to the previous quarter. Bangalore, however, registered a drop in sentiments.
“Although all cities posted positive sentiments, consumers expect prices to remain stable or rise marginally.
With the economy expected to perform better, effective policies in the housing sector will ensure that positive sentiments translate into actual purchase,” IIMB-Century Real Estate Research Initiative (CRERI) lead researcher Uma Sitaraman said.

Samsung seeks smartphone revamp to arrest profit slideSamsung seeks smartphone revamp to arrest profit slide
Reuters
Reuters Samsung spent most of the quarter without launching a new flagship device, and continued to struggle in the mid-to-low tier markets against cheaper and value-packed offerings like Xiaomi's Redmi 1S.
Seoul, Oct 30:  
Samsung Electronics Co Ltd on Thursday said it would revamp its smartphone line-up to take on competitors in the rapidly growing mid-to-low range segment, after third-quarter earnings set it on course for its worst year since 2011.
The global smartphone leader's market share declined in annual terms for the third straight quarter in July-September, lagging Apple Inc in the premium market and overtaken by rivals like Lenovo Group Ltd and Xiaomi Inc at the bottom end, research firm Strategy Analytics said.
Snapshot
Q3 operating profit 4.1 trln won, down 60.1 pct y/y
Samsung says to tap mid-to-low tier market for growth
Mobile division earnings slump to more than 3-yr low
Samsung sees pickup in Q4 profit on TV and memory demand
Executives said the South Korean giant would overhaul its lower-tier line-up to boost price competitiveness and use higher-quality components to set its devices apart, after it announced its worst third-quarter profit in more than three years.
"The mid-to-low end market is growing rapidly, and we plan to respond actively in order to capitalise on that growth," Samsung Senior Vice President Kim Hyun-joon said during a conference call with analysts.
Samsung said its third-quarter operating profit fell by an annual 60.1 per cent to 4.1 trillion won ($3.9 billion), matching its guidance issued earlier this month.
While the company expects profits to pick up in the fourth quarter on strong demand for televisions and memory chips, analysts still expect Samsung to record its worst annual operating profit in three years.
Profits for the mobile division fell 73.9 per cent to 1.75 trillion won in the third quarter, its worst performance since the second quarter of 2011.
Samsung spent most of the quarter without launching a new flagship device, and continued to struggle in the mid-to-low tier markets against cheaper and value-packed offerings like Xiaomi's Redmi 1S.
Robert Yi, Samsung's head of investor relations, said the firm would launch new mid-tier models in the fourth quarter, although he didn't specify what features they would have.
Samsung expects average selling prices for handsets will rise in the fourth quarter due to an increase in premium smartphone sales, namely of the Galaxy Note 4, and as demand picks up in the holiday shopping season.
Analysts say Samsung will likely have to sacrifice margins to protect its market share. Cheaper phones are expected to drive global smartphone market growth in coming years, meaning a general trend of lower average selling prices.
Samsung's chips division was a bright spot, recording a 2.26 trillion operating profit for the July-September quarter to mark the highest earnings since the third quarter of 2010.

Short-covering lifts Sensex 153 pointsSensex surges 248 points to end at new high of 27,346; Nifty gains 79 points
Our Bureau/Agencies
Tweet
Mumbai, Oct 30:  
Led by the recent economic reforms announced by the government, the benchmark BSE Sensex surged 248.16 points to end at a new closing peak of 27,346.33 and the NSE index Nifty rose 78.75 points at 8,169.20.
Domestic sentiment was buoyed on increased buying by investors as the recent economic reforms have instilled confidence that the country can better withstand potential rate hikes in the US.
Sectoral indices
All BSE sectoral indices ended in the green. Among them, realty index was the star-performer and was up 3.44 per cent, followed by IT 2.04 per cent, TECk 1.77 per cent and oil & gas 1.65 per cent.
Gainers, losers
Reliance, TCS, Hindalco, Infosys and GAIL were the top five gainers among 30-share Sensex constituents, while the top five losers were SSLT, M&M, Cipla, Tata Power and Hero MotoCorp.
FDI rules relaxed
Among the recent economic reforms, the Government had yesterday relaxed FDI rules in the construction sector by reducing the minimum built-up area as well as capital requirement and easing the exit norms. Sharess of realty companies, particularly those with high debt, such as Unitech, DLF and Puravankara climbed after the announcement.
Global markets
The dollar surged to a three-week high, bond yields rose and gold fell on Thursday after the US Federal Reserve ended its six-year quantitative easing bond-buying programme.
The decision was widely expected, but a relatively hawkish tone to the accompanying statement was not. It prompted financial markets to rethink the growing consensus that the Fed's first interest rate hike would be late in 2015.
Stock market reaction was more mixed. Asian shares mostly fell, following a slight decline on Wall Street overnight. European bourses opened higher on Thursday, helped by encouraging corporate earnings, but quickly turned negative.
Overnight borrowing costs
In a statement on Wednesday after a two-day meeting, the Fed retained its basic guidance that overnight borrowing costs would remain near zero for a "considerable time".
But it dropped a characterisation of the US labour market slack as "significant" in a show of confidence in the economy's prospects, which markets perceived as a slightly hawkish turn.
In early European trade the dollar index, a broad measure of the greenback's trade-weighted value, was up 0.5 percent above 86.4.
European equity markets initially welcomed the Fed's statement as a sign that the US economy is in good shape, rather than taking fright at the prospect of interest rates perhaps rising sooner than had been expected.
But at 0930 GMT the EuroFirst 300 index of leading shares was down 0.1 per cent at 1317 points. Germany's DAX was down 0.4 per cent and France's CAC40 was down 0.1 per cent, shrugging off upbeat corporate updates from Alcatel Lucent, Technip and Renault.
Britain's FTSE 100 was down 0.5 per cent, and U. futures pointed to Wall Street opening around 0.2 per cent lower.

Written by Ritu Sharma | Ahmedabad | Posted: October 30, 2014 12:47 pm | Updated: October 30, 2014 12:49 pm
The severe cyclonic storm, ‘Nilofar’, over westcentral Arabian Sea and neighbourhood has further weakened and will pass over Gujarat coast as a mere depression at a wind speed of 40-50 kilometre per hour, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) latest release updated.
On Wednesday, the IMD has predicted the very severe cyclonic storm ‘Nilofar’ to cross Gujarat coast as a marginal cyclonic storm with a wind speed of 60-70 kilometer per hour and a maximum speed of 80 kilometre per hour.
The severe cyclonic storm would move northeastwards and rapidly weaken into a depression over northeast Arabian Sea off north Gujarat coast by October 31 evening. It had moved east-north-eastwards during past 6 hours and lay centred on October 30 morning over central and adjoining northeast Arabian Sea about 620 km west-southwest of Naliya in Gujarat and 650 km south-southwest of Karachi in Pakistan, the IMD release stated.
Also, the influence of this system, the earlier prediction of heavy to very heavy rainfall over Gujarat on October 31 and November 1 has been changed to moderate rainfall at most places with only isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall to occur over Kutch and coastal districts of Saurashtra during next 48 hour.
Light to moderate rainfall at many places with isolated heavy falls would occur over remaining districts of Saurashtra, north Gujarat region and southwest Rajasthan during the same period.
While squally wind speed reaching 40-50 kilometre per hour gusting to 60 kilometre per hour would prevail along and off Gujarat coast on October 31. Sea condition along and off Gujarat coast will be rough on October 31. Fishermen along and off Gujarat coast are advised not to venture into the sea during next 48 hours.

First consignments of rice enter Aizawl godowns; FCI plans to import from Myanmar remains inlimboPrint
Written by Adam Halliday | Aizawl | Posted: October 30, 2014 12:36 pm | Updated: October 30, 2014 5:34 pm
The local contractor awarded the task of supplying rice to Mizoram during the six month railway mega-block that will cut off vital supplies to two North-Eastern states and parts of one other, began ferrying in the first batch of 5000 quintals into the state’s main godown on Thursday.
Lalrindika, head of Rem Rem Enterprises, the contractor, said he is also currently in talks with three rice merchants in Mandalay city, Myanmar, as the government attempts the first import of rice from Asia’s erstwhile rice bowl in several decades. The first consignments have been brought from other Indian states thus far.
“We approached the Myanmar central government in Naypyidaw some weeks ago and have been directed to a handful of rice exporters in Mandalay who are currently supplying rice to China,” Lalrindika said, adding he is biased towards importing the mobi variety, a slightly sticky variety of rice in Myanmar that he believes Mizoram residents would most prefer.
He said he may also import some izamin and posan varieties, the former a long-grained rice that is considered the most popular in the neighbouring country.
The Mizoram government had a week ago roped in Rem Rem Enterprises to ferry in 30,000 quintals of rice to alleviate the expected shortage as a result of the gauge conversion work on the North-East Frontier Railways’ Lumding-Silchar route, the normal route taken by Food Corporation of India to supply rice to Mizoram, Tripura and south Assam’s Barak Valley. Roughly 70% of the consignments are transported through this train service while the rest are trucked.
Given the expected rise in the cost of supplying all the rice consignments to these areas by road, the Centre begun shipping in rice to Tripura using a port in Bangladesh, and plans were afoot to import rice for Mizoram from Myanmar, which would work out cheaper than continuing to supply rice to the remote state from Punjab and Haryana.
But the FCI’s tender for rice imports fell through earlier this month because the bids were higher than the corporation expected, and with no new tender being released so far, the Mizoram government went ahead and roped in locals to ferry the rice from Myanmar as well as other parts of India. The contract is initially for 30,000 quintals with a caveat that it can be extended or stopped after that after a review of the work.
This first 30,000 quintals, the contractor said, would be ferried in by mid-November.
“We have had experience importing rice from Myanmar even in the past, mostly smaller consignments from Chin State (the Myanmar province closest to Mizoram). Importing from Mandalay would not be much of a problem either. The companies there will ferry it till the Zokhawthar border-trade facility and we would ferry it to godowns in Aizawl,” Lalrindika said.

US drone attack kills four militants inPakistanBy: Press Trust of India | Islamabad | Posted: October 30, 2014 12:31 pm
At least four militants were killed on Thursday when a US drone struck their compound in northwestern Pakistan’s restive tribal region bordering Afghanistan, officials said.
The pilotless plane hit the militants’ compound in Birmal area of South Waziristan.
A security official said four rebels including a foreign militant of Arab-origin were killed in the attack and the compound was completely destroyed.
There are also reports that some militants were also injured.
The killed Arab was identified as Adil while the exact identity of others was not known.
South Waziristan, adjacent to North Waziristan, was cleared of militants in 2009 but still they are active in its remote areas.
The US has persisted with drone attacks despite complain by Pakistan that such attacks were a violation of its sovereignty.
South Waziristan is one of the seven lawless tribal districts of Pakistan that border Afghanistan.

Shiv Sena praises Narendra-Devendra combine; warns BJP onNCPBy: Press Trust of India | Mumbai | Posted: October 30, 2014 12:10 pm
A day before BJP takes the reins in Maharashtra, Shiv Sena on Thursday  praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister-designate Devendra Fadnavis, saying the state can expect ‘acchhe din’ (good days) under them, but cautioned its former ally against accepting NCP’s support.
It said that the first big challenge Fadnavis government will face will be the floor test and enquired if the BJP plans to overcome it by resting on the back of Shard Pawar-led NCP as it will raise questions about its credibility.
“You (BJP) have come to power by promising to convert Maharashtra into a corruption free and a Congress-NCP free state.
“You (Devendra Fadnavis) come from the Vidarbha region where the NCP had carried out a huge irrigation scam. By taking NCP’s support from the very beginning, questions have arisen on the sanctity of your government,” the Sena said in an editorial in its mouthpiece ‘Saamna’ on the eve of swearing-in of the BJP government.
“The biggest challenge for BJP right now is to prove a majority in the Vidhan Sabha. It is okay to say that you will form a minority government and even manage to run it. But running such a government is against the Constitution.
“(Sharad) Pawar has extended support without being asked for it, but will the (Devendra) Fadnavis government run with the help of Pawar’s support?” the Sena said.
Sena, however, expressed pleasure over Fadnavis leading the state and said that it is a matter of pride that Maharashtra is once again being led by Vidarbha and that it is responsibility of Fadnavis to fulfill people’s aspirations.
“It should be kept in mind that Maharashtra needs a stable government and a stable CM. The son of Vidarbha’s soil will now be leading the government and we believe that he will always keep his feet firmly on the ground.
“The state can now expect ‘acchhe din’ with Narendra (Modi) at the Centre and Devendra in the state. We welcome Fadnavis as the new chief minister,” the Sena said.
After a bitter split ahead of Maharashtra polls, leaders of BJP and Shiv Sena, which remains an NDA constituent, have made conciliatory noises in recent days.
BJP’s strength in the 288-member Assembly has come down to 121 after the death of an MLA. Sena has 63 members. Sharad Pawar’s NCP with 41 MLAs has already offered crucial outside support to BJP and said it will abstain from voting if the new government has to face trust vote to prove its majority.

Toronto schools set to reject Confucius deal  likely to irritate ChinaThe move is likely to irritate Beijing just days before Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper is expected to visit.
By: Reuters | Toronto | Posted: October 30, 2014 4:35 am
Canada’s largest school district is set to end a planned partnership with China’s government-funded Confucius Institute, a move likely to irritate Beijing just days before Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper is expected to visit.
Trustees at the Toronto District School Board, which oversees public schools with 232,000 students, have signaled the district will sever its ties to the language and cultural program after parents, teachers and students protested against any involvement of the Chinese government in Canadian schools.
“It is clear to me that this partnership is not aligned with TDSB and community values, and its continuation is not appropriate,” Trustee Pamela Gough said in an email.
“My concern is that the Confucius Institute is directly controlled by the Communist Party of China, and there is irrefutable evidence that the party exerts its influence through (the institute), for example in restricting freedom of speech on the part of (its) teachers hired in China,” said Gough.
The move follows similar cancellations of Confucius Institute programs at universities in Canada and the United States amid concerns they restrict academic freedom, conduct surveillance of Chinese students abroad and promote the political aims of China’s ruling Communist Party.
The cancellation could further strain bilateral relations between Ottawa and Beijing. Harper is set visit China next week ahead of a multilateral summit, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Wednesday, as the two countries seek to resolve  disputes over cybersecurity and spying.
The Prime Minister’s Office was not immediately available for comment, and representatives of the Confucius Institute also could not be reached.
China’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying has rejected criticism of the Institute, saying after previous cancellations that it was “impossible” that the programs would threaten academic freedom or integrity.
STRAINED TIES
Relations between the two countries were damaged when China detained a Canadian couple living near its sensitive border with North Korea on suspicion of espionage in August. No formal charges have been brought against the couple, Kevin and Julia Garratt, who are being held separately in near isolation, according to their son.
Charles Burton, a professor at Brock University, said Beijing is certain to take note of the high-profile cancellation of the Confucius Institute in Toronto schools.
“It will be taken very badly in China for sure,” said Burton, a former Canadian diplomat who served two tours in China.
“Canada’s reputation in China as being hostile to Chinese foreign policy goals will be enhanced by the fact of Canada’s largest school board causing the Chinese side to lose face by openly and publicly denouncing the idea of a Confucius Institute,” he said.
The full board of Toronto school trustees is expected to vote to end the nascent partnership at about 7 p.m. ET/2300 GMT, endorsing a recommendation earlier in October by a small committee of trustees continued…

The 53rd dai of the Dawoodi Bohra community of Muslims, Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his leadership and initiatives like anti-corruption drive, Swachh Bharat abhiyan and Ganga cleaning project.
Over two lakh Dawoodi Bohra community members from different parts of the country and abroad gathered in Surat to observe Muharaam festival and listen to the preaching of Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin Thursday morning. This is for the first time after he took over from his late father Dr Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin, that Syedna Mufaddal addressed such a large gathering of the community.
Syedna Saifuddin said, “May Almighty bless him (Modi) in all the initiatives undertaken by him and give him great success and sound health.”
He said, “India had seen unique model of prosperity under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efficiency of Indian workmanship is being appreciated across the world. The model of prosperity includes cleaning up the system from corruption, to clean the corners of India of dirt and grime, and to clean the river Ganga from pollution”.
Syedna Saifuddin also praised the Anandiben Patel government and thanked Government of Gujarat for inviting him to Gujarat “as state guest for the event of Muharram in Surat.” He further prayed for peace and communal harmony in India and brotherhood among different sections and religions in India.”
He told the community, a majority of which are businessmen, “In the competitive market, Modi emphasied on quality products to compete in the international market. There should be perfection in our work so that our product gets more value in international market and its demand increases. With this the economic growth of country will be developed and our country will be more prosperous”.

Sri Lanka mudslide: Officials say no hope of findingsurvivorsPrint

By: Associated Press | Koslanda (sri Lanka) | Posted: October 30, 2014 1:03 pm | Updated: October 30, 2014 1:11 pm
A Sri Lankan official said Thursday there was no hope of finding survivors after a mudslide tore through a tea plantation, but there were widely conflicting reports about how many people had been buried alive under the rubble and mud.
Disaster Management Minister Mahinda Amaraweera estimated the number of dead in Wednesday’s disaster at the Koslanda tea plantation would be fewer than 100, although villagers said the figure could easily exceed 200.
“I have visited the scene and from what I saw I don’t think there will be any survivors,” Amaraweera told The Associated Press on Thursday. “But that number is less than 100.”
Initial reports from Sri Lanka’s Disaster Management Center said some 250 people were missing. But Amaraweera has cut that figure significantly, saying some people believed to have been buried were actually at work or school when the mudslide struck at 7:30 a.m. in the island nation’s central hills.
Heavy monsoon rains caused the mudslide, which wiped out 120 workers’ homes at the Koslanda tea plantation in Badulla district, which is about 140 miles (220 kilometers) east of Colombo, said Lal Sarath Kumara, an official from the Disaster Management Center.
A 48-year-old truck driver who gave his name only as Raja said he lost all five members of his household — his wife, two sons, daughter-in-law and his 6-month-old grandchild.
“I left for work early morning and got a call asking me to rush back because there is an earth slip near my home,” Raja said Thursday morning, weeping. “I came back and there is no trace of my home, everyone was buried.”
About 500 military personnel and civilians resumed the rescue operation Thursday morning after halting for the night because of rain and slippery conditions. Mud covered many homes, in some cases leaving only the roofs visible. Water gushing down hillsides indicated more slides were possible.
Scores of children who had left for school early morning returned only to see their homes vanished without a trace along with their parents.
“Everything that I saw yesterday I could not see today — buildings, the temple and shops had all disappeared. I could only see mud everywhere,” said P. Arumugam, who works as a driver on the plantation.

Anti-Islamists take most seats in TunisiapollA Tunisian man shows his ink-stained finger in front of a Tunisian flag after voting for the country's parliamentary elections outside the Tunisian embassy in Cairo, Egypt, Saturday, Oct. 25, 2014. (Source: AP photo)

A liberal party with ties to the deposed regime took the most seats in Tunisia’s parliamentary elections, leaving the once dominant Islamists running a close second, the election commission announced in the early hours of the morning Thursday.
The Nida Tunis (Tunis Calls) Party, running on an explicitly anti-Islamist platform, won 85 of the 217 seats in parliament, giving it the right to name a prime minister and lead a coalition government.
The moderate Islamist Ennahda Party, which had previously dominated the parliament, won 69 seats, or nearly 32 percent, of the new parliament, representing a loss of some 23 seats.
Since overthrowing its dictator in 2011 and kicking off the Arab Spring pro-democracy wave, Tunisia has been buffeted by economic turmoil and terrorist attacks.
Analysts have described Sunday’s election as a referendum on the Islamist-led coalition’s stormy two years in office and punished them for a poor economic performance and unfulfilled expectations of the revolution.
Nida Tunis is led by Beji Caid Essebsi, an 87-year-old veteran politician who previously served as foreign minister in the 1980s and parliament speaker in the early 1990s under later deposed President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.
The party, which includes businessmen, trade unionists and politicians from the old regime, has all but ruled out forming a coalition with the Islamists, describing it as “against their nature,” and will turn to a collection of smaller parties to garner the necessary 109-seat majority.
Running a distant third was the Free Patriotic Union of Slim Rihai, a millionaire football club owner and political neophyte, with 16 seats.
In fourth place came the left-wing coalition of parties known as the Popular Front, which had two of its members assassinated by extremists in 2013.
The liberal Afek Tounes came in fifth place with eight seats.
The remaining 24 seats were split among another dozen small parties.
Election Commission head Chafik Sarsar said Nida Tunis lost one seat in the southern city of Kasserine following reports of widespread election violations by its partisans in that city.
Alone among countries that experienced the Arab Spring, Tunisia’s transition to democracy has remained on track, while Libya and Syria have descended into civil war and Egypt’s military overthrew the elected president.
Despite three years of political wrangling, economic turmoil and a rising number of terrorist attacks, Tunisian politicians from different parties continued…

Vizag port back to normalVizag port resumes cargo operations
Our Bureau
The port had suffered loss of Rs 232 cr in cyclone Hudhud
Visakhapatnam, Oct. 30:  
The Visakhapatnam port has resumed normal cargo-handling operations and is taking steps now to restore some of the damaged installations, according to port chairman M.T Krishna Babu.
He said here on Thursday that the port had incurred loss of Rs 232 crore due to cyclone Hudhud, as the offshore tanker terminal was badly damaged and to some extent the south breakwater as well. "The damage to the conveyor belt in the iron ore handling complex is minimal and the OHC is functioning now normally," he said.
He said the port was importing crude both at the offshore terminal and the single point mooring (SPM). "Fortunately, the SPM has been spared by the cyclone and we are now in a position to import the crude required for the HPCL Visakha refinery at the SPM. But we have to get the offshore tanker terminal repaired for the long run and a team of experts from Afcon company will be at the port shortly for the purpose," he said and added that he could not specify how long it would require for the repairs.
He said the crest of the south breakwater was also damaged but there was no immediate impact on the operations of the port because of it. It would also have to be repaired. He said there was no insurance for any of the port structures. He said the warehouses were also damaged and repairs would have to be carried out.
Krishna Babu said there was, however, no damage to the ongoing projects in the port worth more than Rs 3,000 crore. "The civil works have been completed for many of the projects and there may only be some delay and there is no lasting damage," he added.
He said the container terminal was also functioning normally in the port.

Reliance, TCS, Hindalco, Infosys and GAIL were the top five gainers among 30-share Sensex constituents, while the top five losers were SSLT, M&M, Cipla, Tata Power and Hero MotoCorp.
FDI rules relaxed
Among the recent economic reforms, the Government had yesterday relaxed FDI rules in the construction sector by reducing the minimum built-up area as well as capital requirement and easing the exit norms. Sharess of realty companies, particularly those with high debt, such as Unitech, DLF and Puravankara climbed after the announcement.
Global markets
The dollar surged to a three-week high, bond yields rose and gold fell on Thursday after the US Federal Reserve ended its six-year quantitative easing bond-buying programme.
The decision was widely expected, but a relatively hawkish tone to the accompanying statement was not. It prompted financial markets to rethink the growing consensus that the Fed's first interest rate hike would be late in 2015.
Stock market reaction was more mixed. Asian shares mostly fell, following a slight decline on Wall Street overnight. European bourses opened higher on Thursday, helped by encouraging corporate earnings, but quickly turned negative.
Overnight borrowing costs
In a statement on Wednesday after a two-day meeting, the Fed retained its basic guidance that overnight borrowing costs would remain near zero for a "considerable time".
But it dropped a characterisation of the US labour market slack as "significant" in a show of confidence in the economy's prospects, which markets perceived as a slightly hawkish turn.
In early European trade the dollar index, a broad measure of the greenback's trade-weighted value, was up 0.5 percent above 86.4.
European equity markets initially welcomed the Fed's statement as a sign that the US economy is in good shape, rather than taking fright at the prospect of interest rates perhaps rising sooner than had been expected.
But at 0930 GMT the EuroFirst 300 index of leading shares was down 0.1 per cent at 1317 points. Germany's DAX was down 0.4 per cent and France's CAC40 was down 0.1 per cent, shrugging off upbeat corporate updates from Alcatel Lucent, Technip and Renault.
Britain's FTSE 100 was down 0.5 per cent, and U. futures pointed to Wall Street opening around 0.2 per cent lower.

Bilawal Bhutto attacked at London marchprint

Pakistan’s internal political divisions overshadowed a march to highlight the Jammu and Kashmir issue on Sunday as an angry section of the crowd pelted Pakistan People’s Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto with plastic bottles, shoes and cans as soon as he came on the dais.
 
Angry that Bhutto was allegedly using the event as his political launch pad, the angry mob shouted slogans against him and his father, Asif Ali Zardari, and attacked him, prompting the London police to whisk him away from the dais at Trafalgar Square.
The attackers were alleged to be supporters of Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaaf. Slogans against Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif were also heard.
 
The attack on Bhutto soon led to a separate hashtag #BhagBilloBhag, as people tweeted their joy at his retreat as well as anger at the event being politicised.
 
As many expressed their frustration at the turn of events, the All Parties Hurriyat Conference submitted a memorandum to Britain seeking an early resolution to the Jammu and Kashmir issue at the end of a march.
 
The march covering the short distance from Trafalgar Square to 10 Downing Street was billed as a ‘Million March’, but its strength was nowhere near that mark. People had travelled from several cities in Britain for the event marked by placards with anti-India slogans.
 
The march was said to be organised and led by Sultan Mahmood Choudhry, former prime minister of Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir, and drew participation from leaders of other parties such as Bilawal Bhutto of Pakistan People’s Party and leaders of Muttahida Quami Movement and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf.
 
India has made it clear to Britain that such events provide opportunities to some groups to impede UK-India relations.
 
India had objected to Britain allowing the march during the recent visit of external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj, but London had reiterated its commitment to freedom of speech as well as its reassurance that it was for India and Pakistan to resolve the Jammu and Kashmir issue, without third party intervention, least of all by Britain.
 
"With that reassurance, we are quite comfortable of any march being organised, be it the so-called million march because we, as I said, are country of a billion. Millions do not overawe us," ministry of external affairs spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin said.
 
The APHC led by Mirwaiz Umar Farooq briefly recounted the state's history, mentioned allegations against India and said in the memorandum that the people of Jammu & Kashmir should be allowed the right of self-determination in the same way that the people of Scotland, East Timor and Southern Sudan had enjoyed it.
 
Unlike previous years, when such anti-India events here led to much concern in Indian quarters, there was a quiet confidence that India need not be overly rattled by them, beyond formally making known concerns. This approach was also evident during the 11 September debate on Jammu and Kashmir in the House of Commons.
 
India has made it clear to Britain that such events provide opportunities to some groups to impede UK-India relations.
 
In a significant intervention, Varinder Paul, India's deputy high commissioner, had recently sounded a cautionary note on Indo-UK relations before a London audience comprising Business secretary Vince Cable.
 
Paul had said: “From time to time, we find that there are certain tendencies in certain sections of the society, which are not in the interest of our strong relations. We need to watch out and be mindful of any such efforts. We should not allow any such tendencies to succeed. And this is our shared responsibility”.

OVL inks pact to acquire stake in two Vietnamese oil blocksONGC Videsh inks pact to acquire stake in two Vietnamese oil blocks

ONGC Videsh (OVL), the overseas arm of state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), on Wednesday signed an agreement to pick up to 50 per cent stake in two exploration blocks of PetroVietnam in the South China Sea.
OVL will take 40 per cent stake in Block 102/10 and 50 per cent in 106/10 that lie outside the sea territory claimed by China. PetroVietnam, Vietnam's national oil company, will take half of OVL's 100 per cent stake in Block 128 in South China Sea which the domestic firm had earlier planned to exit.
"OVL signed a Heads of Agreement (HOA) with PetroVietnam Exploration Production (PVEP), a wholly owned subsidy of Vietnam Oil and Gas Group (PetroVietnam), for mutual cooperation for exploration in Blocks 102/10 & 106/10 of PVEP and Block 128 of OVL in offshore Vietnam, subject to due diligence and negotiations on terms of participation," the domestic oil firm said in a statement in the national capital.
The HOA was signed by OVL Managing Director Narendra K Verma and PVEP President and CEO Dr Do Van Khanh.
Moreover, state-owned ONGC signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with PVEP for "mutual cooperation for exploration in the NELP Blocks of ONGC in Andaman and Cauvery Basins, subject to due diligence and negotiations on terms of participation."
The MoU was signed by the oil PSU's Chairman and Managing Director Dinesh K Sarraf and Khanh.
Both the MoU and the HOA were exchanged in the presence of visiting Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung and Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Hyderabad House in the national capital.
OVL forayed into Vietnam as early as 1988, when it was awarded the exploration license for Block 06.1, which is presently producing natural gas.
The company also got exploration Blocks 127 and 128 in 2006. Block 127 was relinquished after completing the work programme. Block 128 is currently under exploration.
The blocks where OVL is picking up stake are from the five that Vietnam had offered in November 2013 to the government to counter growing Chinese influence in the region.
OVL offering PetroVietnam equity in Block 128 is to de-risk exploration in the block over which China had claimed territorial rights.
The domestic firm had in June 2012 decided to return the block as exploration was not commercially viable but did a volte-face at the insistence of the Ministry of External Affairs, which wanted the country to continue its presence in South China Sea.

Government Relaxes Rules for Foreign Investment in Construction
Reuters | Updated On: October 29, 2014 21:49 (IST)
Iron Ore Imports Surge as Prices Fall
New Delhi: The government on Wednesday relaxed rules for foreign direct investment (FDI) in construction development, aiming to make it easier for overseas capital to invest in building in Asia's third-largest economy.
The reductions of minimum requirements for built areas and capital may help Prime Minister Narendra Modi deliver on his promise to create 100 "smart cities" in India by 2020.
Previously, the government allowed 100 per cent FDI in real estate development but with strict riders, including a lock-in period of three years during which the investment cannot be repatriated.
Under the new rules, the minimum built area for projects in which foreign investment is allowed will be reduced to 20,000 square metres from 50,000, the government said in a statement late on Wednesday. The minimum capital investment by foreign companies has been cut to $5 million from $10 million.
The investor will be allowed to expatriate the investment on completion of the project or three years after the final investment is made, the statement said.
India received $1.2 billion of foreign direct investment in the fiscal year ended March 31 compared with $1.3 billion the previous year. Between April and August this year it has received foreign investment worth $446 million.
The new rules will encourage development of smaller projects, especially in urban areas, where the availability of land is limited, said Akash Gupt, executive director at PWC.
The risk of delay in smaller projects will be reduced, Mr Gupt added.

Gold Near 3-Week Low After Fed Optimism Over US EconomyGold Weakens on Global Cues, Silver Falls on Reduced Offtake
Singapore:
Gold was languishing near a three-week low on Thursday after the US Federal Reserve ended its bond-buying stimulus programme and expressed confidence in the economic recovery, dimming bullion's safe-haven appeal.
Ending its monthly bond purchases, the Fed dropped a characterisation of US labour market slack as "significant" in a show of confidence in the economy's prospects.
In a statement on Wednesday after a two-day meeting, the central bank largely dismissed recent financial market volatility, dimming growth in Europe and a weak inflation outlook as unlikely to undercut progress towards its unemployment and inflation goals.
"The announcement struck us as coming across more hawkish than what the market was expecting," said INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir.
Gold, often seen as an alternative investment during economic and financial uncertainty, fell on fears the vote of confidence in the recovery could prompt the Fed to raise interest rates soon. Bullion, as a non-interest-bearing asset, could take a hit when higher rates are in place.
"We think the next shoe to drop will come on Thursday when US GDP numbers for the third quarter will be released. If the number comes in higher than 3 per cent, as we suspect it will, we would not rule out another round of heavy selling in gold that could see us revisit the old lows of $1,180," Meir said.
Spot gold was little changed at $1,213.22 an ounce by 0239 GMT. In the previous session, it touched $1,208.26, its lowest since Oct. 8, before closing down 1.3 per cent.
The metal hit a 15-month low of $1,183.46 earlier this month.
US gold futures slid about 1 per cent to $1,213.20 on Thursday, tracking losses in spot gold.
The US Commerce Department will release gross domestic product figures at 1230 GMT. The economy is expected to have grown at a solid 3 per cent annual rate in the third quarter.
In a reflection of investor sentiment, SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings fell 0.16 per cent to 742.40 tonnes on Wednesday, a six-year low.
The outflows could undermine any possible rally in gold.
In the wider markets, Asian stocks dipped and the dollar hovered at three-week highs versus the yen after the Fed's statement.

Aviation Regulator Acts Tough Against Troubled SpiceJet: Report
New Delhi: FMCG firm Emami on Wednesday reported a 16 per cent increase in consolidated net profit at Rs 92.76 crore for the second quarter that ended on September 30, 2014, on the account of higher sales.
The company had posted a net profit of Rs 79.96 crore for the corresponding period a year ago.
Net sales rose to Rs 489.60 crore during the quarter under review, up 20.37 per cent from Rs 406.74 crore a year ago, Emami said in a filing to the BSE.
"Strong performances by our power brands in key categories ensured a healthy topline growth of 20.4 per cent despite the market facing low growth across categories. Our international business continues to grow from strength to strength," Emami director Mohan Goenka said.
In Q2, Emami's domestic business grew by 18.4 per cent and international business by 33 per cent.
International business sales growth was led by Bangladesh and neighbouring SAARC and CIS countries.
For the half year period ended September 30, the company posted a net profit of Rs 163.58 crore as against Rs 140.64 crore in the corresponding period last year.
Net sales of the company for the half year period ended September 30 rose to Rs 971.33 crore as compared to Rs 790.39 crore in same period in the previous fiscal year.
Shares in Emami, on Wednesday, ended at Rs 759.40 apiece on the BSE, up 0.03 per cent from the previous close.

US Federal Reserve ends bond-buying programHoward Schneider and Michael Flaherty     Washington   Last Updated: October 30, 2014  | 11:43 IST
(Photo: Reuters)
The United States Federal Reserve on Wednesday ended its monthly bond purchase program and signaled confidence the US economic recovery would remain on track despite signs of a slowdown in many parts of the global economy .
"The Committee continues to see sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing progress toward maximum employment in a context of price stability," the central bank's policy committee said in a statement following a two-day meeting.
The statement largely dismissed recent financial market volatility, dimming growth in Europe and a weak inflation outlook as headwinds that would do little to undercut progress toward the Fed's unemployment and inflation goals.
The Fed pointed to strengthening labor markets, saying that slack in labor markets was "gradually diminishing".
It retained its basic language regarding interest rates from recent statements, saying that rates would remain low for a "considerable time" following the end of the bond purchases in October.
The timing and pace of rate hikes would depend on incoming economic data, the US central bank said, new language that apparently earned the support of Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser and Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher, who dissented at the previous meeting.
On inflation, the US Fed acknowledged that lower energy prices and other forces were holding inflation down, but that overall the economy should progress toward the central bank's target of 2 per cent.
"The Committee judges that the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 per cent has diminished somewhat since early this year," the statement said.
Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota was the only dissent on the grounds that a downturn in inflation expectations meant the central bank should commit to keeping interest rates lower for longer.
The decision to shutter the bond-buying program was almost foregone. The monthly purchases had been steadily cut from US $85 billion to US $15 billion as part of the apex bank's gradual turn away from policies launched to fight the 2007-2009 recession and breathe more life into a tepid recovery.
The Fed will continue reinvesting the proceeds of securities that mature each month, meaning its more than US $4 trillion balance sheet will remain intact for the time being.

Sensex Hits Record High on Continued Reform Push  Surges Over 250 PointsYou are here: Home Market
Sensex Hits Record High on Continued Reform Push; IT Stocks Rally
NDTV | Updated On: October 30, 2014 15:46 (IST)
IVRCL Allots First Tranche of Shares to CDR Lenders
Indian stock markets rallied sharply on Thursday, with Sensex and Nifty setting new life highs. The Sensex rose nearly 300 points to an all-time high of 27,390 while Nifty jumped nearly 90 points to hit a new record high of 8,181.55.
Continued reform push by the government has boosted sentiments, traders say. On Wednesday, the government relaxed rules for foreign direct investment (FDI) in construction development.
The new rules make it easier for foreign companies to invest in India and many projects will now qualify for FDI through automatic route (no FIPB clearance will be required), analysts say.
Shares in realty and construction companies also rallied with DLF advancing 5 per cent. ( Read the full story here )
Lower-than-expected increase in wheat support prices also aided sentiment, analysts say. Lower increase in minimum support prices bodes well for the food price inflation outlook and thus should help lower headline inflation in the coming quarters, Nomura says.
The rally in Indian markets has also been fuelled by a sharp drop in global crude prices, which have hit a four-year low. The fall in Brent crude means significant savings for the Indian economy, which is likely to narrow both the current account deficit and the fiscal deficit.
Thursday's big push came from IT stocks, which rose sharply after the US Federal Reserve overnight expressed optimism about economic recovery. India's IT sector is heavily dependent on the US economy for growth. ( Read more )
The IT sub-index led Thursday's rally, rising 2 per cent as compared to the 1 per cent rise in the broader Sensex. HCL Tech and Tech Mahindra gained 3-4 per cent.
The Fed also ended its stimulus programme, called QE3, but maintained the stance of "low rates for a considerable period of time". Analysts say this is positive for equities and rupee, which have gained substantially from overseas funds.
The Sensex ended nearly 250 points higher at a new closing high of 27,346. Nifty rose 78 points to end at 8,169, just shy of its closing all-time high of 8,173.

A Bench of Justices Deepak Mishra and U U Lalit also issued notices to the Centre and Tamil Nadu Government on Swamy’s plea for scrapping the provisions for criminal defamation in penal laws.
The court stayed the proceedings in all five defamation cases filed against Swamy in the sessions court of Chennai.
Swamy submitted that the provision of criminal defamation is unconstitutional as it put unreasonable restrictions on people’s right to free speech and expression.
He challenged the validity of Section 499 and 500 of Indian Penal Code and Section 199 (2) of criminal procedure code pertaining to criminal defamation.
Five defamation cases were filed against Swamy by the State Government after the BJP leader had allegedly made some defamatory allegations against Jayalalithaa on social networking site.

Mumbai, Oct 30:  
Shares of diversified group Raymond today slumped five per cent after the company reported 26.18 per cent decline in consolidated net profit for the September quarter.
Raymond had yesterday reported 26.18 per cent decline in consolidated net profit at Rs 68.12 crore for the second quarter ended September 30, 2014 due to higher expenses.
Reacting to the numbers, the shares of the company opened on a weak note at Rs 478 and fell 4.98 per cent to an early low of Rs 464.10 on the BSE.
Similar movement was seen on the National Stock Exchange, where the stock opened at Rs 476, then fell as much as 4.87 per cent to a low of Rs 464.
Marketmen attributed the fall in the counter to weak September quarter earnings.
For the half-year period ended September 30, 2014 the company posted a net profit of Rs 35.27 crore against a net profit of Rs 42.60 crore in the corresponding period last year.
Commenting on the results, Raymond CMD Gautam Hari Singhania said: “While the revenue growth was in line with our expectations, however, profitability did not meet our desired targets, particularly in the branded textile segment and engineering businesses.”

Companies hit as DGCA bans use of drones to provide services on security fears

(“We have reached out to…)
BANGALORE: Several companies have had to stop using drones to provide services such as aerial photography after the aviation authority banned the operation of these unmanned vehicles in civilian airspace until regulations are in place.
The decision has set back plans of companies offering a variety of services using drones, including those by online retailer Amazon to deploy them to speed up delivery of products to consumers, according to defence analyst Debajit Sarkar of research firm Market Info Group .
Mumbai-based Airpix , with clients such as Reliance Energy and builders Kalpataru and Omkar Realtors, had to stop offering its flagship aerial photography service since the Directorate General of Civil Aviation issued the circular earlier this month.
"We have reached out to DGCA and we are yet to figure out what to do," said Shinil Shekhar, the 25-year-old cofounder of Airpix.
Although aerial photography was its core offering, the company said it plans to launch a new product next month that will help contribute to revenue.
The DGCA is in the process of formulating regulations and globally harmonising them for certification and operation for use of unmanned aerial systems in Indian civil airspace, the regulator said in a circular dated October 7.
"Till such regulations are issued, no non-government agency, organisation, or an individual will launch a UAS in Indian civil airspace for any purpose whatsoever," it said.
The civil operation of UAS will need approval from the air navigation service provider, defence, ministry of home affairs and other security agencies, besides the DGCA.
The decision has affected movie production houses, which had been renting drones instead of helicopters for aerial shots.
Four-year-old Line Production India, which counts Karan Johar's Dharma Productions as one of its clients, said there are about 1 lakh production houses in Mumbai alone and most of them are clueless about the order. An unmanned aerial vehicle, commonly called a drone, can cut costs by 80%, said Line co-founder Gautam Waze. Online retailer Amazon, which plans to use drones to deliver goods to customers in India, had approached the DGCA in September, Sarkar of Market Info said.
"The government is yet to carry out extensive studies on allocating spectrum, segregating airspace, deciding what altitude they can fly. Regulations will not come out this year or the next," said Sarkar.
Housing.com, a residential property listings site, which introduced aerial photography using its fleet of drones in January, said it no longer provides this service to customers.
With aerial photography, builders could show prospective clients project sites, the current status of construction, and views from various floors to help them decide on purchasing property.

Solid third-quarter US economic growth is ex...(Many economists predict…)
WASHINGTON: It's taken years, but the US economy may finally be reaching a sustainable cruising speed.
Many economists predict that overall growth, as measured by the gross domestic product , reached a healthy 3 per cent annual rate in the July-September quarter, according to a survey by data firm FactSet .
The Commerce Department will release its first estimate of GDP growth in the third quarter at 8:30 a.m. EDT Thursday.
If the expectations prove accurate, it would be the fourth quarter in the past five in which the economy has reached at least a 3 per cent growth rate.
For the April-June period, growth reached a sizzling 4.6 per cent rate. But that marked a sharp bounce back from the first quarter, when the economy shrank at an annual rate of 2.1 per cent _ a contraction normally associated with recessions. The stumble reflected largely a harsh winter that closed shopping malls and disrupted much economic activity.
After the roller-coaster first- and second-quarter gyrations, most analysts think the economy is poised to achieve consistently stronger growth for the rest of this year and all of 2015.
Many think full-year growth for 2015 will hit 3 per cent, giving the economy the best annual performance since 2005, two years before the Great Recession began.
Much of the optimism stems from the strength of job growth, which has lowered the unemployment rate to a six-year low of 5.9 per cent. In September, the economy added 248,000 jobs, extending a string of strong gains.
The additional workers should translate into more income and consumer spending, which accounts for 70 per cent of economic activity.
The strength in the United States comes amid weakness overseas. Europe is on the brink of its third recession in seven years, Japan is faltering and China and Brazil are also struggling.
The Federal Reserve noted the brightening US prospects as it ended a policy meeting Wednesday. It retained language in a statement saying it didn't expect to raise its benchmark interest rate for a ``considerable time.'' But it also pointed to rising signs of strength, including job gains and lower unemployment.
Against that backdrop, the Fed ended its third round of bond buying. Over the past six years, the Fed has pumped more than $3 trillion into the economy through bond purchases designed to keep long-term rates low.
Most economists don't expect the Fed to begin raising rates before June. But they viewed the Fed's statement as a warning that if the economy strengthened more than expected in coming months, rate hikes could start occurring sooner than investors think.

(Paul highlighted that PM…)
LONDON: NRI industrialist Lord Swraj Paul has called for granting Indian passports to expatriates who invest a certain minimum amount in industries in India and help ignite the engine of economic growth.
"We now have a one-party government (in India), and a prime minister who appears determined to make Indian expatriates feel welcome in their homeland. Encouraging expatriate involvement could help ignite the engine of economic growth," Lord Paul said while speaking at the 14th London Global Convention on Corporate Governance and Sustainability.
In his address at the event organised here by the Institute of Directors India, he emphasised that for too long India has been burdened with an old, cosy, family-and- favourites, under-the-table style of doing and managing business.
"For the first time I now have confidence that that is going to change. Symbolic gestures are also very important. I hope the next step will be to grant expats an Indian passport. If not for all of them, then surely for those who invest a certain minimum amount of money to set up industries in India," Paul, the Chairman of the Caparo Group, said yesterday.
"It would probably be too late to be of any benefit to me, but it will certainly help and encourage the younger generation of entrepreneurs," said Paul, who was one of the first NRIs to invest in India substantially in the 1980s.
Paul highlighted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pledged to end corruption and end the illicit flow of funds which are a "disgrace to a proud nation".
"We have a mature and very experienced President ( Pranab Mukherjee ), having held every important portfolio; a deeply committed Prime Minister, and a Finance Minister ( Arun Jaitley ) who is widely regarded as highly competent. All of them are determined to make India a fairer society, and secure for the nation its due place in the world," he said.
Noting that their efforts have generated high hopes, Paul said, "For the first time in a long while, these expectations appear to be within reach."
He stated that if these expectations are to be realised, a few basic changes are needed and India has to simplify the rules and make sure that all inward investment whether in infrastructure, business, health, education, research etc conforms to those rules.
"When it does not, it must be disallowed," Paul said. Investment that enriches itself but does little or nothing for society does nothing for India today, he said.
Noting that it is also time to end the process where every case has to be individually considered by the government before approval, Paul said that "this is time consuming and opens the door for local lobbyists to stall proceedings."
"It also creates opportunity for corruption. A lot of companies trying to invest in India have suffered from this and it has unfortunately given India a bad name. Yet major opportunities for business are in prospect. The Prime Minister has said that just like Corporate Social Responsibility there should also be Corporate Government Responsibility. And this is something we should strongly support," Paul said.
He stated that many of the top universities are extremely keen to forge links with India.
"The two universities of which I am Chancellor -- the University of Wolverhampton and the University of Westminster -- have been working with India to set up new programmes and opportunities for our young people. Both the rewards and the reciprocity have been very encouraging," he said.
"Such initiatives must be vigorously advanced. I feel strongly that only by providing top class education can a nation build a sustainable future. We need to draw on every resource to accomplish this," Paul said.
"As someone who has been in the manufacturing business for a long time, I am glad the Prime Minister is concerned that manufacturing business has been leaving India in the past four years. He is committed to its return and has asked businesses that were thinking of moving out to stay and prosper under his new regime," he said.
Paul called for help to provide stable manufacturing base which will give jobs to young people.
"Let us manufacture and invest in the goods that India needs and can also export to other nations -- things like ecologically sound low cost construction, low cost vehicles, solar energy , clean biological sanitation and water management systems," he said.
Stating that "we are now at a turning point in modern India history," Paul said, "if we make the best use of the present opportunities, we will achieve what I know everyone in this room wants -- India that is good for its people, good for the global Indian community and good for the world."

Sensex makes all-time high | Realty stocks gain upto 9% on FDI normsRealty stocks on fire; gain upto 9% as government eases FDI norms

(The realty stocks have been…)
MUMBAI: Shares of realty companies gained momentum for second straight session on Thursday after the Cabinet relaxed FDI in the construction sector, including housing.
The realty stocks have been buzzing for the last two sessions in anticipation of positive news flow. The S&P BSE Realty Index has surged 7 per cent in the period.
The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved a comprehensive proposal by the Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion (DIPP), dropping the minimum 10-hectare rule for serviced housing plots and slashing the minimum floor area for construction development projects to 20,000 sq m from 50,000 sq m to be eligible for overseas investment.
It has approved 100 per cent FDI under the automatic route and cap on minimum investment is now down to $5 million from $10 million earlier. According to J C Sharma, Vice Chairman & MD, Sobha Developers, the government's move of 100 per cent FDI in construction is a welcome move. All the stocks in the BSE Realty Index were in the green.
DLF rallied 5.79 per cent intraday, Sobha Developers pared some gains after hitting intraday high of 9 per cent, and HDIL and DB Realty touched intraday highs of 3.71 per cent and 3.76 per cent, respectively.

Are realty stocks attractive bet as government relaxes FDI norms for construction?
ECONOMICTIMES.COM Oct 30, 2014, 04.31PM IST
(The Cabinet has decided…)
MUMBAI: The BSE Realty Index, which bit the dust after the fall of 2008, is the top sectoral gainer in trade today.
While leveraged balance sheets and slowdown in sales are still major concerns, the government's decision to relax FDI norms in the construction sector, including housing, has come as a shot in the arm for most of the realty companies.
The Cabinet has decided to allow 100 per cent FDI under the automatic route and lowered cap on minimum investment to $5 million from $10 million earlier.
According to the government, the measures taken by the government are likely to attract investments in new areas and encourage development of plots for serviced housing given the shortage of land in and around urban agglomerations as well as the high cost of land.
The measures are also expected to result in creation of much needed low cost affordable housing in the country and development of smart cities. According to analysts, interesting time lies ahead for the realty sector. As interest rates are expected to come down sooner than expected, the sales are likely to pick up next year. Rally in the equities market will help these companies to raise equities to de-leverage their balance sheets.
"The entire market capitalisation of the (realty) sector has fallen to Rs 70,000 crore, which is less than 1 per cent of the overall market capitalisation of India today. This sector in absolute term looks very cheap," said Madhusudan Kela, Chief Investment Strategist, Reliance Capital, to ET Now. "You do not need a genius to call that this sector will outperform the broader markets," he added.
Kela is of the view that a lot of real estate companies have been able to reduce their debt burden and in absolute term, it looks cheap. If over the next two-three years inflation and interest rate come down, that will aid this sector.
Ramesh Damani, Member, BSE, is of the view that there is huge opportunity in the construction sector. The Prime Minister is focusing on smart cities and affordable housing.
"There are ample opportunities for people to move into that sector. All the stocks have beaten down, the balance sheets are pretty poor. So it is a good idea to go and stock pick in that sector," he told ET Now. However, investors should be cautious before taking a call on realty stocks and buy only good quality stocks.
"Reality as a sector looks very interesting, but unfortunately there are not many large players which are without any issues. Some of the large players have had many issues recently," said Vikas Khemani of Edelweiss Securities.
According to him, this is one of the reasons why investors are a bit of hesitant committing a large amount of money in the sector.
"If you ask me, would reality companies do well? The answer is yes, but currently, the choice of stocks to play for investors is limited and that problem continues to remain," he added.
The realty stocks have been buzzing for the last two sessions in anticipation of positive news flow. The S&P BSE Realty Index has surged 7 per cent in the period.
The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved a comprehensive proposal by the Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion (DIPP), dropping the minimum 10-hectare rule for serviced housing plots and slashing the minimum floor area for construction development projects to 20,000 sq m from 50,000 sq m to be eligible for overseas investment.

Jalandhar mob plays judge and jury  ties up and assaults Africans for  stealingJalandhar mob plays judge, ties up and assaults Africans for 'stealing'
Ravinder Vasudeva , Hindustan Times  Jalandhar, October 30, 2014

A court in Punjab on Wednesday remanded to judicial custody two Africans, who were tied to pole with a rope for an hour and beaten up by a mod and policemen for allegedly trying to steal money from a shop.
At a time a debate is raging on hate crimes following Africans nationals in Delhi crying discrimination, the case has hogged the headlines for the treatment meted out to the youth.
They were identified as Irakarama Aiaier, a resident of Rwanda, and Sinarinli Alain, a resident of Burundi. Aiaier, Alain and one Ncuti Roger, another Rwanda resident, are accused of an attempted robbery on Tuesday at a grocery shop in Jalandhar.
While the first two were held, Roger managed to escape.

Even though the arrested have claimed to be students of bachelor of computer applications course at Lovely Professional University (LPU), the university authorities have denied this.
"They are not our students right now. The two arrested were the BCA second year students in the university till March last year, but then they stopped coming to the university," said LPU deputy director Aman Mittal.
The police conducted on Wednesday raids at the paying guest accommodation in where the three were staying.
The police investigation found the two arrested were living in Jalandhar, even as their visa expired a few months ago and they had not applied for an extension.
The police have also sent e-mails to the embassies of Burundi and Rwanda to find out the status of their visa details.
Meanwhile, the assault on the two African nationals has triggered a debate, putting the spotlight on the role of the authorities concerned in such cases. This is the third major case involving African students in the state in as many years. They were tied to a pole with a rope and assaulted for an hour before the police intervened.
In April 2012, Yannick Ntibateganya, a Burundi national, was brutally beaten up by nine locals. He died in June this year after remaining in coma for more than two years.
In June 2013, police booked 21 African students following a brawl with a Jalandhar-based resident.
Local BJP MLA Manoranjan Kalia said, "I am surprised at the casual way in which the local police have been dealing with the presence of foreign students. Why are the police not maintaining a proper record of their presence in different localities? The educational institutes must keep the local administration updated about the whereabouts of these students."

Malala donates $50 000 to re-build UN schools in Gazaprint
Pakistani teenage rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai has donated $50,000 to help rebuild UN schools in Gaza that have been damaged during the recent fighting in the enclave.
"We must all work to ensure Palestinian boys and girls, and all children everywhere, receive a quality education in a safe environment. Because without education, there will never be peace," Malala said in Stockholm as she received the prestigious World Children's Prize.
Malala, 17, said the money would be channelled through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) to help rebuild 65 schools in the Palestinian territory.
The money would help children get "quality education" and continue their life, knowing they were not alone and that people were supporting them, she said.
Malala, who survived being shot in the head by the Taliban in 2012 and now lives in the UK, was jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize earlier in October, alongside India's 60-year-old Kailash Satyarthi for their championing of children's rights.
Malala has her own fund to help small-scale organisations in a number of countries, including Pakistan.
She is the first person to receive the children's prize and the Nobel in the same year.
The Sweden-based organisers of the children's prize said millions of children around the world had voted for Malala.
In remarks published on the UNRWA website, Malala said the organisation was performing "heroic work" to serve children in Gaza.
"The needs are overwhelming - more than half of Gaza's population is under 18 years of age. They want and deserve quality education, hope and real opportunities to build a future," Malala said.
"This funding will help rebuild the 65 schools damaged during the recent conflict. Innocent Palestinian children have suffered terribly and for too long," she said. Pierre Krahenbuhl, UNRWA's commissioner general, said the organisation was "deeply touched" by the gesture.
It would "lift the spirits of a quarter of a million UNRWA students in Gaza and boost the morale of our more than 9,000 teaching staff there," he said.
He said Malala had "become a symbol of the boundless potential that lies within each and every child on Earth", and she was "an aspirational figure to the next generation in Palestine and beyond" as well as an inspiration to all.
The recent 51-day conflict in Gaza saw entire neighbourhoods flattened and almost one-third of the population uprooted. The violence killed more than 2,100 Palestinians, including more than 500 children, and more than 70 Israelis. The children's prize also announced two honorary laureates -- John Wood and Indira Ranamagar from Nepal.

Delhi govt: SC terms L-G s move  positive   gives time till Nov 11Minority govt possible in Delhi, says SC

Terming lieutenant governor Najeeb Jung's move to talk to all political parties on forming a government in Delhi as "positive", the Supreme Court on Thursday adjourned hearing on the matter to November 11.
"There could be a minority government with outside support of a political outfit. Let us wait for some time," the Supreme Court said while hearing a plea from the Aam Aadmi Party on dissolving the assembly and holding fresh polls in Delhi.
Referring to recent media reports, a five-judge constitution bench headed by Chief Justice HL Dattu said, "Whatever I have read in newspapers, it appears that the L-G has made positive moves."  
The bench asked Prashant Bhushan, counsel for AAP, to file a plea seeking dissolution of the Assembly, to wait for sometime as the L-G had started the consultation process with the political players in the national capital and adjourned the matter till November 11.
During the brief hearing, the bench also comprising justices J Chelameswar, A K Sikri, R K Agrawal and Arun Mishra, said that if the LG feels that there is a possibility of government formation, then he should be given time to explore it.
L-G Najeeb Jung, who returned from abroad Wednesday,  had met Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and called the BJP, Congress and AAP to discuss any possibility of forming a government.
"In view of the President's approval to explore the possibility of installing a popular government in Delhi, the Lt Governor would be exploring the possibilities with the leaders of all political parties over the next few days," LG's office had said.
BJP, which is the single largest party, is yet to give any clear signal on its strategy but there were indications that the party was preparing for fresh polls in January or February.
Sources said BJP president Amit Shah and Union ministers Nitin Gadkari and Rajnath Singh were in favour of the party forming a government while some others were of the view that it should not run away from polls when Prime Minister Narendra Modi's rating was high.
"There is a possibility of the party turning down offer of government formation," a senior party leader told PTI.
The L-G's decision to begin consultations with the political parties came a day after a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice H L Dattu slammed the Centre and the Lt Governor for delay in taking a decision on government formation in Delhi.
AAP and Congress had come down hard on Jung, questioning his move to hold consultation with the parties when it was clear that no party was in a position to provide a stable government.
Currently BJP, along with ally Akali Dal's lone MLA, has 29 legislators and will require the support of five more MLAs to prove majority in the 67-member assembly if it decides to form the government.

Arvind Mayaram moved from tourism to minority affairsComments
Former finance secretary Arvind Mayaram took over as the minority affairs secretary on Thursday evening after the government cancelled his appointment as tourism secretary hours before he was to take charge.
Instead, the government appointed an old hand in the tourism sector, Lalit P Panwar, as the tourism secretary.
Mayaram had been ordered to move out from the finance ministry as part of a high-profile reshuffle about a fortnight ago. He was to move to the tourism department while Rajasthan-cadre officer Rajiv Mehrishi was named to succeed him as the economic affairs secretary on November 1.
On Wednesday night, the appointments committee of the cabinet decided to appoint Panwar — a Rajasthan cadre officer — as tourism secretary and sent Mayaram to the minority affairs ministry.
Government sources said the new appointment orders were conveyed to the officials concerned early on Thursday.
Due to a delay in Rajasthan chief secretary Mehrishi taking charge, expenditure secretary RN Watal has also been told to handle additional charge as economic
affairs secretary for a month.
A PMO official attributed the change in department to the assessment that Panwar would be better suited to the tourism sector. The PM is understood to have been impressed with Panwar at a recent meeting. Mayaram is the second senior finance ministry official to be axed by the new government. Revenue secretary Rajiv Takru was the first; moved initially to the department of north east development and a few months later, moved as secretary to the national minority commission.

Sri Lanka says no hope finding mudslide survivorsprint
A Sri Lankan official said on Thursday there was no hope of finding survivors after a mudslide tore through a tea plantation, but there were widely conflicting reports about how many people had been buried alive under the rubble and mud.
Disaster management minister Mahinda Amaraweera estimated the number of dead in Wednesday's disaster at the Koslanda tea plantation would be fewer than 100, although villagers said the figure could easily exceed 200.
"I have visited the scene and from what I saw I don't think there will be any survivors," Amaraweera told The Associated Press on Thursday. "But that number is less than 100."
Initial reports from Sri Lanka's Disaster Management Center said some 250 people were missing. But Amaraweera has cut that figure significantly, saying some people believed to have been buried were actually at work or school when the mudslide struck at 7:30am in the island nation's central hills.
Heavy monsoon rains caused the mudslide, which wiped out 120 workers' homes at the Koslanda tea plantation in Badulla district, which is about 140 miles (220 kilometers) east of Colombo, said Lal Sarath Kumara, an official from the Disaster Management Center.
A 48-year-old truck driver who gave his name only as Raja said he lost all five members of his household - his wife, two sons, daughter-in-law and his 6-month-old grandchild.
"I left for work early morning and got a call asking me to rush back because there is an earth slip near my home," Raja said Thursday morning, weeping. "I came back and there is no trace of my home, everyone was buried."
About 500 military personnel and civilians resumed the rescue operation Thursday morning after halting for the night because of rain and slippery conditions. Mud covered many homes, in some cases leaving only the roofs visible. Water gushing down hillsides indicated more slides were possible.
Scores of children who had left for school early morning returned only to see their homes vanished without a trace along with their parents.
"Everything that I saw yesterday I could not see today - buildings, the temple and shops had all disappeared. I could only see mud everywhere," said P. Arumugam, who works as a driver on the plantation.
Most of Sri Lanka has experienced heavy rain over the past few weeks, and the Disaster Management Center had issued warnings of mudslides and falling rocks. The monsoon season here runs from October through December.
A local government official said that the area had been marked vulnerable since 2008, and evacuation drills had been conducted.
However, workers had not been given alternative homes to move into, the official said on condition of anonymity because government rules prohibit him from speaking to media. He said the absence of a proper rain water draining system on the hill may have loosened the soil over time.
Sri Lanka, formerly called Ceylon, is one of the world's leading producers of tea. Most Ceylon tea, as it is known, is produced in the central hills, where the high altitudes and rainfall provide favorable conditions.

Vizag port resumes cargo operationsVizag port resumes cargo operations
Our Bureau
The port had suffered loss of Rs 232 cr in cyclone Hudhud
Visakhapatnam, Oct. 30:  
The Visakhapatnam port has resumed normal cargo-handling operations and is taking steps now to restore some of the damaged installations, according to port chairman M.T Krishna Babu.
He said here on Thursday that the port had incurred loss of Rs 232 crore due to cyclone Hudhud, as the offshore tanker terminal was badly damaged and to some extent the south breakwater as well. "The damage to the conveyor belt in the iron ore handling complex is minimal and the OHC is functioning now normally," he said.
He said the port was importing crude both at the offshore terminal and the single point mooring (SPM). "Fortunately, the SPM has been spared by the cyclone and we are now in a position to import the crude required for the HPCL Visakha refinery at the SPM. But we have to get the offshore tanker terminal repaired for the long run and a team of experts from Afcon company will be at the port shortly for the purpose," he said and added that he could not specify how long it would require for the repairs.
He said the crest of the south breakwater was also damaged but there was no immediate impact on the operations of the port because of it. It would also have to be repaired. He said there was no insurance for any of the port structures. He said the warehouses were also damaged and repairs would have to be carried out.
Krishna Babu said there was, however, no damage to the ongoing projects in the port worth more than Rs 3,000 crore. "The civil works have been completed for many of the projects and there may only be some delay and there is no lasting damage," he added.
He said the container terminal was also functioning normally in the port.

Sensex hits all-time high of 27 358.85Sensex surges 248 points to end at new high of 27,346; Nifty gains 79 points
Our Bureau/Agencies
Tweet
Mumbai, Oct 30:  
Led by the recent economic reforms announced by the government, the benchmark BSE Sensex surged 248.16 points to end at a new closing peak of 27,346.33 and the NSE index Nifty rose 78.75 points at 8,169.20.
Domestic sentiment was buoyed on increased buying by investors as the recent economic reforms have instilled confidence that the country can better withstand potential rate hikes in the US.
Sectoral indices
All BSE sectoral indices ended in the green. Among them, realty index was the star-performer and was up 3.44 per cent, followed by IT 2.04 per cent, TECk 1.77 per cent and oil & gas 1.65 per cent.
Gainers, losers
Reliance, TCS, Hindalco, Infosys and GAIL were the top five gainers among 30-share Sensex constituents, while the top five losers were SSLT, M&M, Cipla, Tata Power and Hero MotoCorp.
FDI rules relaxed
Among the recent economic reforms, the Government had yesterday relaxed FDI rules in the construction sector by reducing the minimum built-up area as well as capital requirement and easing the exit norms. Sharess of realty companies, particularly those with high debt, such as Unitech, DLF and Puravankara climbed after the announcement.
Global markets
The dollar surged to a three-week high, bond yields rose and gold fell on Thursday after the US Federal Reserve ended its six-year quantitative easing bond-buying programme.
The decision was widely expected, but a relatively hawkish tone to the accompanying statement was not. It prompted financial markets to rethink the growing consensus that the Fed's first interest rate hike would be late in 2015.
Stock market reaction was more mixed. Asian shares mostly fell, following a slight decline on Wall Street overnight. European bourses opened higher on Thursday, helped by encouraging corporate earnings, but quickly turned negative.
Overnight borrowing costs
In a statement on Wednesday after a two-day meeting, the Fed retained its basic guidance that overnight borrowing costs would remain near zero for a "considerable time".
But it dropped a characterisation of the US labour market slack as "significant" in a show of confidence in the economy's prospects, which markets perceived as a slightly hawkish turn.
In early European trade the dollar index, a broad measure of the greenback's trade-weighted value, was up 0.5 percent above 86.4.
European equity markets initially welcomed the Fed's statement as a sign that the US economy is in good shape, rather than taking fright at the prospect of interest rates perhaps rising sooner than had been expected.
But at 0930 GMT the EuroFirst 300 index of leading shares was down 0.1 per cent at 1317 points. Germany's DAX was down 0.4 per cent and France's CAC40 was down 0.1 per cent, shrugging off upbeat corporate updates from Alcatel Lucent, Technip and Renault.
Britain's FTSE 100 was down 0.5 per cent, and U. futures pointed to Wall Street opening around 0.2 per cent lower.

BEIJING: China's Xiaomi Inc has become the world's third-largest smartphone vendor in just three years after first hitting the market, trailing only Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Apple Inc , according to a new industry study.
Strategy Analytics said Xiaomi accounted for 6 per cent of all 320 million smartphones shipped during July-September. Samsung made up 25 per cent, down from 35 per cent a year earlier due to rising competition from several directions.
Apple's share also fell slightly to 12 per cent.
"Xiaomi was the star performer," Strategy Analytics Executive Director Neil Mawston said in a statement.
"Samsung continues to face tough competition from Apple at the higher-end of the smartphone market, from Xiaomi and Huawei in the middle-tiers, and from Lenovo and others at the entry-level."
Xiaomi has been the top seller in its home market of China and recently entered India, where it sells phones exclusively through e-commerce site Flipkart.
Vice President Hugo Barra told Reuters in Bangalore last month that the company aimed to sell 100,000 phones a week in India in October when the country celebrates Diwali.

Reliance Hospital doctors to use Google Glass to pull patient's medical history using SAP's app

(The Glass costs $1,500 a…)
BANGALORE: When a patient enters the emergency ward of Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital and Research Centre in Mumbai, he would be greeted by a doctor, who would be wearing a Google Glass and would already know the patient's entire medical history, allowing the treatment to begin within a few minutes.
The junior doctor can diagnose the patient, consult senior doctors and read the patient's medical history on Google Glass, without taking his eyes off the patient even for a minute. The renovated hospital, which last week was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, would be the Minister Narendra Modi, would be the first in the country to use Google Glass in its everyday operation.
The project is still in its pilot phase and would be deployed across the hospital within a month's time.
SAP has a built an app called 'We Care' for the hospital, which connects the Google Glass with the hospital information system, and all data recorded on the Google Glass can be automatically be stored in the system. Doctors can also pull out various reports about the patient by just tapping on the Glass and instead of scribbling notes in a piece of paper, they can just talk to the Glass, which will type in all the notes for them.
"This remarkable app has the potential to bring patient care to new heights," said Mukesh Jain, CIO at the 345-bed, multi-specialty hospital. "SAP has blended perfectly with We Care solution smooth clinical workflow and the smartphone hands-free format of smart glasses for the potential use of any physician anywhere." Reliance is looking at applying Google Glass in emergency care to start with. When the patient is brought in, the trauma doctor who would be attending to the patient first would have a Google Glass and would be able to look up the patient's past records and also collaborate with other departments as when the patient is brought in.
The information is stored centrally and stored in the hospital information system. Doctor can pull in the patient's X-ray images or radiology reports from the past and use them.
"Usually in the healthcare environment, it is only the patient who is stationary—everything else is mobile," said Andy David , Health care Director , SAP APJ. "With the help of the Google Glass, doctors can attend to multiple patients, engage with them and see almost twice as many patients during the rounds. Doctors can take accurate notes on the Google Glass itself.
The data is stored automatically and can be accessed when required." The We Care application, which was designed completely in India by SAP India Labs , could soon turn into a product that will be available to any hospital worldwide. The Reliance hospital is so far the first one to implement it globally.
The Glass costs $1,500 a piece but the same app also works on mobiles and tablets to make it more cost efficient.
As the usage of Google Glass increases, the price of the gadget is expected to go down significantly. Initially seen as just a creepy gadget, Google Glass is seeing many applications in the enterprises recently. In June this year, Dr Pavan Kumar, head, cardiac surgery, at Mumbai's Nanavati Hospital used Google Glass to record a surgery.
Nanavati hospital is also working on an application that will let it use Google Glass for telemedicine.
Several applications are being developed for Google Glass by various developers in the areas of retail, manufacturing and warehouse management, which could gain momentum once Google Glass is officially launched in the country and cost of the device goes down.
SAP Labs India is also working with other smart glass manufacturers such as New York-based Vuzix to design applications for different industry verticals.

The benchmark Sensex on Wednesday surged 217 points to end at five-week  high of 27,098.17 powered by gains in interest rate sensitive stocks,  tracking rally in global markets ahead of the outcome of US Federal  Reserve's policy meeting .
Besides, hopes of further economic  reforms by Modi government, rising rate cut expectations and fall in  international oil price too buoyed sentiments, said brokers.
Rising for the straight second straight day, the BSE Sensex reclaimed the key 27,000-mark for the first time since September 22.

"Expectations  from the FOMC meet, resultant nervousness and profit booking kept the  market range-bound today. We expect US Fed to wrap up its bond buying  program but it would continue to maintain low interest rates for long  term," said Rakesh Goyal, Senior Vice President, Bonanza Portfolio.
In  addition, covering-up of short positions by speculators ahead of  Thursday's monthly expiry in the Indian derivatives segment played a  part in trading.
Stocks of commercial vehicle makers were in good demand.

Much to lend: If the policy rates are lowered, the base rate may come down in three-six months’ time
With loan demand weakening and firms tapping the market for funds, banks are tweaking rates on a selective basis
Mumbai, October 29:  
Amidst low credit demand and corporates stepping up borrowings from the market, banks are tweaking interest rates on loans to India Inc.
On a selective basis, depending on the tenure or security of the loan, banks, especially in the private sector, are tweaking rates to suit the demands of corporates.
“Yes, there is some amount of decrease that is beginning to happen. We need to see policy rates come down before any significant reduction can be seen. Incremental lending has become competitive, reflective of probably a bit of a decline in interest rates,” said Jaideep Iyer, Senior President – Financial Markets at YES Bank.
Corporates have been going to the market by borrowing through commercial papers and other corporate bonds for the past three-four months.
Paresh Sukthankar, Deputy Managing Director of HDFC Bank, in a post results conference call, said: “Corporate lending rates have seen some pressure. This is because competition has increased in the corporate segment. Also, companies have moved to borrowing more through commercial papers. Therefore, banks have to effectively make money available at a slightly lower cost.”
Retail focus
With weaker credit demand on the corporate front, some banks are focusing on retail growth. However, not all banks are in favour of lowering interest rates.
A Bank of India official said, “With less credit demand, it is a dynamic situation and the decision to reduce interest rates will be definitely looked into. Lending has been weak for fresh projects as there is no fresh capex expansion by corporates. So, lowering may not make much sense,” the official said. Central Bank of India’s Executive Director RK Goyal added, “So far, we have not reduced our lending rates to any of our corporates… Good corporates are not coming to banks, and we cannot reduce our rates below the base rate, which is 10.25 per cent.
“Some corporates are borrowing from the markets at about 9.5 per cent.”
He added that the bank’s current corporate lending exposure has fallen to 52 per cent from 60 per cent a year ago, while the non-corporate credit portfolio has grown to 48 per cent from 40 per cent.
However, the slowing pace in corporate lending has led to a decline in overall credit growth in the system. Loan growth in the banking industry slipped to 9.7 per cent in September, as compared with 17 per cent in the corresponding period last year.
Bankers said that if lower rates persist and is followed by lowering of policy rates, the base rate may be cut in three-six months’ time.

Good governance key to 8-9 per cent growth  says FMGood governance key to 8-9 per cent growth, says FM Arun Jaitley
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: October 29, 2014  | 22:00 IST
FM Arun Jaitley
The economy has the capacity to grow at 8-9 per cent and good governance would make economic expansion "more exuberant", Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Wednesday.
"I have always wondered to myself that in the last two years with average to moderate governance (economic growth was sub-five per cent). India has a capacity to grow by 8-9 per cent. If we had followed the best practices and displayed the highest standards of good governance, probably our (levels) of growth would have been more exuberant," he said in his valedictory address at the CAG conference.
Amid investments slowing down and allegation of corruption in allocation of natural resources, India's economic growth had slumped to below 5 per cent in 2012-13 and 2013-14.
The economy, however showed signs of rival as the GDP clocked 5.7 per cent growth in the April-June period of the current fiscal, highest in the past 10 quarters.
The BJP led-NDA government, which assumed power in May, had fought the election on the promise of providing good governance to the country.
A recent World Bank report projects India's economy to expand by 5.6 per cent this fiscal as reforms gain momentum and the growth is expected to accelerate as proposed measures such as Goods and Services Tax provide a boost to manufacturing sector.
Highlighting the importance of audit, Jaitley said accountability and transparency are essential as it helps in good governance.
"...(if) uncomfortable questions at times were not asked, governance would tend to become despotic and therefore in any system of governance there has to be various laws of accountability and this is in itself an unquestionable proposition," he added.

Jute exports drop 12 %
process industry
Jute exports in the first five months of this fiscal have dropped both in terms of value and volume as compared to the same period in the previous year.
Cumulative exports in rupee terms were lower by 12 per cent at Rs. 565.50 during the said period.
In dollar terms, exports were lower by 14 per cent.
Competition
Hit hard by competition from Bangladesh, Indian exporters find it tough to retain their share in the international market. Exporters also rue the absence of any Central scheme at a time when the Bangladesh government extends a range of benefits to aid exports.
While India has a 55 per cent share in world jute production, followed by Bangladesh (41 per cent), India’s share in exports is a mere 22 per cent and Bangladesh’s 77 per cent
The Union Textiles Ministry, which governs the jute sector, had noted recently that there was no specific scheme to promote jute goods in the international market after the expiry of the External Market Assistance Scheme.

To make phased investment spread over five years
Swedish industrial group Sandvik is planning to set up a world-class manufacturing facility at Chakan near Pune. The company is expected to make phased investment, spread over five years, in the proposed plant. In the first tranche, the company will invest $45 million (Rs.270 crore) to start development of the site by mid-2015. The facility is expected to become operational by 2016. Sandvik has strong presence in India since 1960. It was one of the first Swedish companies to set up a subsidiary with a manufacturing footprint. The upcoming manufacturing facility at Chakan will have the capability to deliver multiple products catering to Sandvik’s diverse businesses.
The facility will also house Sandvik’s group R&D centre. The new R&D centre will strengthen Sandvik’s R&D presence in the region to support customers and lead strategic research projects on a global level.
Strategic investment
PTI reports from New Delhi:
Addressing a press conference here on Wednesday, company President and CEO Olof Faxander said Sandvik would make ‘strategic investments’ in a phased manner over the next five years primarily to produce equipment used in mining, metal cutting and construction sectors. The 53-acre unit would also house a research and development facility.
Mr. Faxander, however, did not divulge the total investment that the company might make, but said it would entirely depend on the market.
“This is the next phase of our evolution in India. We have a strong foundation in India already, and this commitment to set up a new world-class manufacturing facility will help us further innovate and create solutions for India’s emerging needs under the visionary ‘Make in India’ initiative,” he said.
Sandvik India head Parag Satpute said the investment at the Chakan facility was a reiteration of the company’s belief in building India as a key manufacturing hub for the Sandvik group.
“The Chakan facility will drive synergies and economies of scale for our domestic operations as well as exports,” Mr. Satpute added.

KR Srivats
New Delhi, Oct 30:  
The Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet chief executives of public sector banks (PSBs) on November 5.
This meeting, which will be held in the Capital, assumes importance as it will be the first instance when Prime Minister himself will interact with the chief executives of PSBs.
It comes at a time when public sector banks are crying for reforms and nearly eight of them are headless.
Indications are that the meeting--which will also be attended by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley--will see review of banks' operational and financial performance including status of nonperforming assets.
The top 30 NPA accounts of each bank will also come up for discussion, official sources said.

Samsung Electronics Q3 net falls to more than 3-year lowSamsung Electronics Q3 profit falls to more than 3-year low

Samsung Electronics Co would revamp its smartphone line-up to take on competitors in the rapidly growing mid-to-low range segment, after third-quarter earnings set it on course for its worst year since 2011.
Samsung said its third-quarter operating profit fell by an annual 60.1 per cent to 4.1 trillion won ($3.9 billion), matching its guidance issued earlier this month.
Profit for the mobile division fell 73.9 per cent to 1.75 trillion won in the third quarter, its worst performance since the second quarter of 2011.
Executives said the South Korean giant would overhaul its lower-tier line-up to boost price competitiveness and use higher-quality components to set its devices apart, after it announced its worst third-quarter profit in more than three years.
"The mid-to-low end market is growing rapidly, and we plan to respond actively in order to capitalise on that growth," Samsung Senior Vice President Kim Hyun-joon said during a conference call with analysts.
The global smartphone leader's market share declined in annual terms for the third straight quarter in July-September, lagging Apple Inc in the premium market and overtaken by rivals like Lenovo Group and Xiaomi Inc at the bottom end, research firm Strategy Analytics said.
While the company expects profits to pick up in the fourth quarter on strong demand for televisions and memory chips, analysts still expect Samsung to record its worst annual operating profit in three years.
The company spent most of the quarter without launching a new flagship device, and continued to struggle in the mid-to-low tier markets against cheaper and value-packed offerings like Xiaomi's Redmi 1S.
The company's chips division was a bright spot, recording a 2.26 trillion operating profit for the July-September quarter to mark the highest earnings since the third quarter of 2010.
Robert Yi, Samsung's head of investor relations, said the firm would launch new mid-tier models in the fourth quarter, although he didn't specify what features they would have.
Samsung expects average selling prices for handsets will rise in the fourth quarter due to an increase in premium smartphone sales, namely of the Galaxy Note 4, and as demand picks up in the holiday shopping season.
Analysts say Samsung will likely have to sacrifice margins to protect its market share. Cheaper phones are expected to drive global smartphone market growth in coming years, meaning a general trend of lower average selling prices.

India better at protecting minority investors than USWorld Bank report finds India better at protecting minority investors than US, Japan
Mail Today Bureau     New Delhi   Last Updated: October 30, 2014  | 11:21 IST

India is a much better destination for protecting minority investors and credit availability, but its position in terms of doing business has worsened to 142 globally this year, according to a World Bank report titled 'Doing Business 2015: Going Beyond Efficiency'.
In South Asia, the report said that India implemented the largest number of regulatory reforms in June 2013-June 2014 with 20 followed by Sri Lanka with 16. In terms of protection of minority investors and credit availability, India is at 7th and 36th places respectively compared to 34th and 28th last year. These are the only two categories (out of ten considered by World Bank ) where India is ranked among top 50 countries-a target set by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the overall ranking.
"India strengthened minority investor protections by requiring greater disclosure of conflicts of interest by Board members increasing the remedies available in case of prejudicial related party transactions and introducing additional safeguards for shareholders of privately held companies," the report states.
India is ahead of the US, Japan, France and Germany when it comes to protecting minority investors. New Zealand has topped the list and is followed by Hong Kong, Singapore, the UK and Malaysia. While Ireland has been ranked sixth place, India, Canada and Albania have jointly been placed at the seventh position.
Major countries ranked below India include France (17th), Korea and Italy (21st), the US (25th), Japan (35th), Germany (51st), Australia (71st) and Switzerland (78th). On ease of getting credit in India, the report said, "... in India a little over a decade ago, an entrepreneur seeking a loan to grow his business would have had little luck because financial institutions lacked access to information systems to assess creditworthiness. Today, thanks to the creation and expansion of a national credit bureau offering credit scores and coverage on par with those in some high-income economies, a small business in India with a good financial history is more likely to get credit and hire more workers."

Even before the formal swearing-in of the new government on Friday, Maharashtra’s chief minister-designate Devendra Fadnavis and his core team have started preparing to hit the ground running, reviewing projects and areas of immediate concern in key departments.
Bureaucrats from the Home and Finance departments were among those who made detailed presentations through Wednesday afternoon to Fadnavis, Eknath Khadse and Vinod Tawde, the latter two expected to get key portfolios in the new Cabinet.
Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Dr Amitabh Rajan confirmed he had made a nearly two-hour-long presentation at the state guest house, Sahyadri, on 45 key subjects in the Home department, ranging from anti-corruption, women’s safety, terror/security, tribes, legislation, resources for projects and more. “It was not a wishlist or a presentation of slides,” said Dr Rajan, adding it was a wide-ranging discourse.
Top bureaucrats from other departments, including Industries, are expected to brief the new government later this week.
Government sources said Wednesday’s discussions with Fadnavis’s core team was in addition to the department-wise presentations already sought from secretaries. Every department has been asked to keep a presentation ready on progress on projects underway and those in the pipeline. At least one secretary said he had scanned the BJP’s pre-election Vision Document as well.
Sources said the young chief minister is keen to bring out a “Vision Document” for Maharashtra that could be released soon after the new ministers assume office.
A vision document at the start of their tenure is a pattern that BJP states appear to be following. Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister unveiled a “Vision 2018” plan soon after returning to the state’s top job in December last year. The Rajasthan government is also said to be working on a similar vision statement.
An official from the Information Technology department said their presentation, which was submitted earlier, included some ideas from the Digital India programme of the NDA government.
A source in the Finance department also said their presentation included a detailed analysis of the state’s debt scenario. The UD department’s presentation focused on key infrastructure projects, including those under way as well as those proposed or stalled, those for Mumbai, with a special focus on a slew of projects in the city that can be kicked off early.
Sena’s plan out today
Mumbai: The Shiv Sena leadership, which met on Wednesday at party chief Uddhav Thackeray’s residence Matoshree in Mumbai, will announce the party’s future course of action on Thursday.
The top leaders of the party were unanimous on Sena joining the government led by its estranged ally BJP only if it got a third of the cabinet seats and important portfolios like Home. The BJP, however, is not keen on sharing vital departments with the Sena.
“We had a detailed discussion with senior party leaders. We will come out continued…

Court asks CBI why it didnt follow rules during searchPrint
Written by Kaunain Sherrif | New Delhi | Posted: October 30, 2014 2:21 am
A Delhi court has asked the CBI Director and other officials to furnish “written explanations”, and also file an action taken report (ATR) against its officials for not following the prescribed law in conducting searches in which the agency filed case against RAW officials and a private firm for alleged irregularities in supplying high-altitude tents to a unit of the external intelligence agency.
Special CBI Judge Gurvinder Pal Singh said that despite the court’s directions to the CBI officials to follow the law prescribed under provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure while conducting search operations, there was a “flagrant violation” of it.
“The order be delivered in the offices of SP concerned of CBI and DIG concerned of CBI as well as worthy Director of CBI for furnishing written explanations and the ATR against erring officials, in terms of the law laid and procedure established, within 10 days,” the judge said.
The court has issued the directions for violations of salutary provisions contained in sub-section (4) and (8) of Section 100 of the Criminal Procedure Code as well as for not recording appropriate statements of witnesses of the search. The sub-section (4) mandates that before making a search, the investigating officer shall call upon two or more independent inhabitants of the locality in which the place to be searched is located.
The judge observed that the CBI in its supplementary case diary on the searches mentioned that search team made efforts to take witnesses from the locality. However, it did not yield any results, adding that the house in the neighbourhood was locked.
“It is not borne out of material on record or shown in the case diaries as to why stated witnesses of search, not of localities of search were selectively chosen to witness the search. No witness of neighbouring locality was even requested. It is not the case of the investigating agency that the places of search were secluded from any localities,” the court said in its order.
Talking to The Indian Express, CBI officials said that the government witnesses were examined as per procedure. The Indian Express had first reported the case of alleged irregularities in purchases made by an unit of RAW.

Lift all sanctions before nuclear deal: IranIran wants all Western sanctions to be lifted before striking a deal on its contested nuclear programme.
By: Agence-France Presse | Paris | Posted: October 30, 2014 5:21 am | Updated: October 30, 2014 5:44 am
Iran wants all Western sanctions to be lifted before striking a deal on its contested nuclear programme by a November deadline, a top official has said.
Yesterday’s announcement came amid intensifying efforts to conclude a definitive pact. The six powers in the talks with Iran – Britain, China, France, Russia, the United States plus Germany, known as the P5+1 – have set November 24 as the deadline.
The chairman of the Iranian parliament’s National Security and Foreign Policy Commission Alaeddin Boroujerdi said the US proposal of a gradual lifting of sanctions was “unacceptable.”
“If we want a definitive accord on November 24, there must be an immediate lifting of sanctions,” he told a news conference in Paris.
A Western diplomat close to the negotiations with Iran on Monday said a firm deal by the deadline was highly unlikely, saying Tehran would have to make “significant gestures.”
The aim is to close avenues towards Tehran ever developing an atomic bomb, by cutting back its enrichment programme, shutting down suspect facilities and imposing tough international inspections.
In return, the global community would suspend and then gradually lift crippling economic sanctions imposed on the Islamic republic.
But the two sides, despite long-running talks, remain far apart on how to reconcile their objectives.

Girls  jihadi quest stirs Muslim communities  fearThis file photo shows the apartment complex, which police say is the home of one of the three teenage girls who, according to US authorities, were en route to join the Islamic State group.
By: Associated Press | Aurora | Posted: October 30, 2014 6:38 am
The strange journey of three suburban Denver girls who authorities say tried to join Islamic State militants in Syria has many in their close-knit east African community worried about whether their own children will be the next to be lured to terror.
The girls’ voyage has mystified many in the US, and has been even more troubling among Aurora’s Somali and Sudanese immigrants, thousands of whom fled civil war and forged new lives in the Denver suburbs, where refugees easily find jobs driving cabs or working in the meat industry.
But while the girls’ parents were working to give them a better life, being a Muslim teenager isn’t easy in an American high school, said Ahmed Odowaay, a community advocate who works with youth. It’s easy to feel like an outsider, even as a US citizen.
Even his 10-year-old daughter gets taunts of “terrorist” when she wears her hijab in school, he said.
“This community is outcast. They feel like they don’t belong here. They’re frustrated,” Odowaay said from his seat at Barwaaqo, a restaurant hidden in one of Aurora’s low-slung strip malls, where other men dined on goat and spaghetti, a favorite east African dish. “I’m worried their frustrations will lead them in the wrong direction.”
Young people in communities like this across the country are vulnerable to extremists in Syria and elsewhere who reach out to them online, promising the glory of battle, the honor of becoming a wife, or just acceptance. Odowaay said it’s easy for young Muslims to encounter recruiters while trolling Facebook. He said it’s happened to him.
Family and friends saw the three – two Somali sisters ages 17 and 15 and their 16-year-old Sudanese friend – as typical Muslim teenagers who like the mall and movies, not fundamentalists.
It wasn’t until they missed class that the 16-year-old’s father realized they had been talking online to militants, who convinced them to steal cash from their parents, buy plane tickets and head to Syria with their US passports. Authorities said one of the girls did most of the planning and encouraged the others to follow.
Alarm spread quickly as friends and relatives realized the girls were gone, and saw signs of their plans on their Twitter accounts.
“She asked her friends to pray for her … and at that time, I just knew that something really bad was going to happen,” said the father of a 16-year-old, who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because he is concerned for the girls’ safety.
He called the FBI and his state representative for help, and continued…

HP-owned IT services firm Mphasis has reported a net profit of Rs 160.20 crore for the quarter ended September 30, 2014.
This is against a profit of Rs 190.22 crore for the quarter ended October 31, 2013.
The company's revenue stood at Rs 1,464.87 crore in the quarter under review against Rs 1,594.03 crore in the corresponding period.
Mphasis has changed its financial year from October 31 to March 31, and therefore the numbers are not comparable.
The banking and capital market segment contributed Rs 611.4 crore to the quarter's revenues, while insurance accounted for Rs 194.79 crore. IT, Communication and Entertainment vertical contributed Rs 246.79 crore and Emerging Industries segment accounted for Rs 406.11 crore of the quarter's revenues.
Mphasis' direct organic business revenue in mature markets recorded a sequential growth of 2.5 per cent in Q2 FY15. Direct business stood at 64 per cent of consolidated net revenues in the said quarter.
During the quarter, Mphasis won new deals with total contract value of $65 million.
"We continue to see good traction in our direct organic business. Our focus on GRC, Digital and AMS is paying off," Mphasis CEO Ganesh Ayyar said.

Maharashtra: Sena reaches out to BJP; Uddhav s decision on saffron alliance likely todayThe Shiv Sena made another desperate effort on Thursday to reach out to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), even as it promised to announce its stand on joining the Devendra Fadnavis government soon.
Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray addresses a party rally in Mumbai. (Agencies)
The Sena, in an editorial in mouthpiece Saamna, praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister-designate Devendra Fadnavis, saying the state can expect 'acchhe din' (good days) under them, but cautioned its former ally against accepting Nationalist Congress Party's (NCP's) support.
 
It said that the first big challenge the Fadnavis government will face will be the floor test and that if the BJP seeks support from the Sharad Pawar-led NCP, it will raise questions about its credibility.
 
"You (BJP) have come to power by promising to convert Maharashtra into a corruption free and a Congress-NCP free state.
You (Devendra Fadnavis) come from the Vidarbha region where the NCP had carried out a huge irrigation scam," the Sena said.
Meanwhile, Fadnavis is in Delhi to hold talks with and BJP president Amit Shah, just a day ahead of the Maharashtra CM's swearing-in ceremony at the Wankhede Stadium.
Uddhav's party has also told the BJP to include its leaders in the oath-taking ceremony, TV channels reported early Thursday, quoting unnamed sources.
A Sena leader told mediapersons on Wednesday, "We met (Shiv Sena chief) Uddhav Thackeray and discussed the future course of action with him. The wait is over now, just one more day. We will announce our decision tomorrow (Thursday)."
However, there are also indications that the Sena was ready with a Plan B, which includes Uddhav's party contesting the assembly speaker's poll — a move that could make the BJP uncomfortable.
The BJP, which has 122 seats in the 288-member Maharashtra assembly, needs 23 more legislators to reach the magic figure. BJP legislator, Govind Rathod (elected from Nanded district), died of a heart attack last Sunday. With the support of small parties and independents, the BJP's tally is around 135.
The NCP, with 41 MLAs, has offered unconditional support to the BJP on the day election results were declared. Some reports also said the BJP was prepared to run a minority government.
But, speculations are rife that the BJP will finally join hands with the Sena. The two parties parted ways ahead of the October 15 elections following differences over the sharing of seats.
While the Sena is demanding one-third of the portfolios in the Maharashtra cabinet - and the swearing-in of two of their ministers with Fadnavis' team - the BJP continues to play hardball with its former ally, apparently buoyed by the advantageous position it is in.
Even though JP Nadda, the newly-appointed BJP general secretary in charge of Maharashtra, said his party wanted to take the Sena along, there are reports that no breakthrough was in sight yet.
A top central BJP leader, when asked if there was any headway in discussions with the Sena, said talks would resume only after the oath- taking ceremony on Friday.
"No talks (with Sena) are currently underway. Our whole focus is on making October 31 a grand success. We will resume talks only after that," he told PTI, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
Meanwhile, a source said Uddhav was prepared for the worst and had started working on an alternative.
The Sena has zeroed in on the names of some of its legislators for the leader of opposition position.
According to Sena leaders, the BJP is asking them to be part of the government without any concrete proposal, and that is unacceptable to Uddhav.
"If we are going to be part of the government, then we should know how many ministries we will get. We need our ministers to be sworn in along with the BJP ministers.
"Right now, all the BJP has said is 'come on board and then we will decide'. The Sena doesn't want to seem like a beggar. It has been conveyed to Uddhavji that we are ready to sit in the opposition," said a senior Sena legislator, adding that the Sena chief did not want to seem as being "unreasonable" by refusing to speak with the BJP.
Another legislator said the BJP must realise that before proving majority in the assembly, they will have to elect a Speaker.
The Sena is in talks with the NCP and the Congress to support a Sena candidate for the post.
If this happens, the BJP will then be forced to deal with the Sena for all decisions in the House, including passing important bills.
"...things will get difficult for the BJP on the floor of the House," said the MLA.

Palestinians urge UN to demand Israel endsettlementsSettlement activity will only further escalate tensions at a time that is already tense enough, US representative David Pressman told the council. (Source: AP photo)

The Palestinians have urged the UN Security Council to demand that Israel immediately reverse plans to build more Jewish settlements, at an emergency meeting called to address tensions in east Jerusalem.
The 15-nation council yesterday met for urgent talks at Jordan’s request after Israel announced plans on Monday to build 1,000 new settler homes in east Jerusalem, which the Palestinians consider the capital of a future state.
“Israel, the occupying power, must be demanded to cease immediately and completely its illegal settlement activities throughout the occupied Palestinian territory, including east Jerusalem,” Palestinian ambassador Riyad Mansour told the council.
But no resolution was adopted and there was no Security Council statement condemning Israel.
Israel however came under strong criticism from several countries including from the United States, which called for an end to unilateral actions including settlement expansions.
“Settlement activity will only further escalate tensions at a time that is already tense enough,” US representative David Pressman told the council.
British Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant warned that ongoing construction of Jewish houses in Palestinian territories “makes it much more difficult for Israel’s friends to defend it against accusations that it is not serious about peace.”
Speaking to the council, top UN official Jeffrey Feltman said the Israeli practice of moving settlers to Palestinian territories was “in violation of international law” and runs counter to a two-state solution of a Palestinian state alongside Israel.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is “alarmed” by the latest plans for new Israeli settlements which “once again raise grave doubts about Israel’s commitment to achieving durable peace,” Feltman told the council.
Israel’s latest push for settlements followed weeks of skirmishes between Palestinian youths and police in east Jerusalem over fears that Israel wanted to restrict access to the al-Aqsa mosque, Islam’s third holiest site.
Feltman called for a de-escalation, saying that both sides “can ill-afford” to inflame tensions so soon after the devastating Gaza war, which left more than 2,000 Palestinians dead.
Israel’s ambassador Ron Prosor shot back, rejecting suggestions that settlement building jeopardized peace and accusing the United Nations of “playing second fiddle” to a Palestinian “campaign to vilify” his country.
“There are many threats in the Middle East, but the presence of Jewish homes is not one of them,” Prosor told the council.

Kerala High Court backs govts bar ban; top-end hotels can continue to serveliquorHigh Court says 32 bars in four-stars can function
Written by Shaju Philip | Thiruvananthapuram | Posted: October 30, 2014 2:11 pm | Updated: October 30, 2014 8:35 pm
Kerala High Court on Thursday gave a partial ratification for the state government’s new liquor policy. Now bars in two and three star categories have to be closed down, while 32 bars in four-stars can function.
As per the liquor policy, only five star hotels were entitled for liquor license. Kerala has 750-odd bar hotels. Of them, 418 bars have remained closed since April this year, pending renewal of their license. Among the rest of the functioning hotels, now five star hotels (21), four star hotels (33) and heritage hotels (8) can run their liquor bars as per the verdict of the single bench of the Kerala high court. But, the high court ratified the closure of a major chunk of the bars, which manage a lions part of bar sales of liquor in Kerala.
ALSO READ: Did anyone check the bill?
The single bench of Justice Surendra Mohan was hearing 80-odd petitions of bar hotel owners challenging the new liquor policy of the Congress government. The bar hotel owners had argued that there was discrimination in the government policy mainly on two grounds; that five-star hotels were allowed to function and the government was still continuing with the retail business of liquor through Kerala State Beverages Corporation. Around 80 per cent of the liquor business in Kerala is handled by the Corporation.
Citing a Supreme Court verdict of 2012, the high court said there was discrimination in preventing liquor license to four star hotels. It said the four and five star hotels should be considered equally while granting liquor licence. The court also evoked the Article 14 of the Constitution (equality before the law) while referring to the discrimination in denying liquor licence to four star hotels.
The verdict has not put any deadline for closure of the now functioning hotels, except 62 bars (four, five and heritage categories).
Congress state president V M Sudheeran and Chief Minister Oommen Chandy welcomed the high court verdict. But aggrieved owners of two and three category bars said they would appeal against the verdict as a major chunk of the bar business is handled in these two categories.
It was on August 21 that the Congress-led United Democratic Front announced its new liquor policy which had closure of all bar hotels, except those in five-start category and bring down retail outlets in every year in a manner to go for total prohibition in next one decade.
Already 418 bars, many of them below three-star category, have been remained closed since April this year following a Supreme Court directive to decide on renewing the licenses of hotels identified as sub-standard years back. As the general elections were round the corner, the Congress government delayed the decision.
Later, the issue emerged as a matter of discord between Chief Minister Oommen Chandy and party state chief V M Sudheeran, who was against reopening of the continued…

Madras HC fines school teacher Rs 50 000 for pinching studentscheekPrint

The Madras high court has imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 for pinching her student’s cheek as a punishment. The order was issued by the first bench of HC comprising Chief Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice M Sathyanarayanan.
In 2012, Rama Gowri, a teacher at Kesari higher secondary school in Mylapore, pinched the cheek of a class VII boy for not doing his homework and he sustained minor injuries.
After Meharunnisa, the boy’s mother, took the matter to the State Human Rights Commission, there were several proceedings besides a criminal case filed against the teacher.
During the hearing before NHRC, the teacher reportedly claimed that she had only twisted the boy’s ears. Her argument was that the boy’s cheek was injured when he tried to move away while she was holding his ear.
In May 2013, the commission imposed a fine of Rs 1,000 on the Mylapore school for violation of human rights. But the boy’s mother decided to appeal the Madras HC, complaining of the school management for delaying the issuance of transfer certificate and demanding an increase in the quantum of compensation .
She had also filed a fresh complaint against the teacher before a magistrate court in the city.
Meanwhile, calling all these multiple proceedings a harassment, the teacher moved HC seeking help. However, on Thursday, HC ordered the teacher to pay a compensation/fine of Rs 50,000 and approach the judicial magistrate court, Saidapet where the case was pending against her.

Companies hit as DGCA bans use of drones to provide services on security fears

(“We have reached out to…)
BANGALORE: Several companies have had to stop using drones to provide services such as aerial photography after the aviation authority banned the operation of these unmanned vehicles in civilian airspace until regulations are in place.
The decision has set back plans of companies offering a variety of services using drones, including those by online retailer Amazon to deploy them to speed up delivery of products to consumers, according to defence analyst Debajit Sarkar of research firm Market Info Group .
Mumbai-based Airpix , with clients such as Reliance Energy and builders Kalpataru and Omkar Realtors, had to stop offering its flagship aerial photography service since the Directorate General of Civil Aviation issued the circular earlier this month.
"We have reached out to DGCA and we are yet to figure out what to do," said Shinil Shekhar, the 25-year-old cofounder of Airpix.
Although aerial photography was its core offering, the company said it plans to launch a new product next month that will help contribute to revenue.
The DGCA is in the process of formulating regulations and globally harmonising them for certification and operation for use of unmanned aerial systems in Indian civil airspace, the regulator said in a circular dated October 7.
"Till such regulations are issued, no non-government agency, organisation, or an individual will launch a UAS in Indian civil airspace for any purpose whatsoever," it said.
The civil operation of UAS will need approval from the air navigation service provider, defence, ministry of home affairs and other security agencies, besides the DGCA.
The decision has affected movie production houses, which had been renting drones instead of helicopters for aerial shots.
Four-year-old Line Production India, which counts Karan Johar's Dharma Productions as one of its clients, said there are about 1 lakh production houses in Mumbai alone and most of them are clueless about the order. An unmanned aerial vehicle, commonly called a drone, can cut costs by 80%, said Line co-founder Gautam Waze. Online retailer Amazon, which plans to use drones to deliver goods to customers in India, had approached the DGCA in September, Sarkar of Market Info said.
"The government is yet to carry out extensive studies on allocating spectrum, segregating airspace, deciding what altitude they can fly. Regulations will not come out this year or the next," said Sarkar.
Housing.com, a residential property listings site, which introduced aerial photography using its fleet of drones in January, said it no longer provides this service to customers.
With aerial photography, builders could show prospective clients project sites, the current status of construction, and views from various floors to help them decide on purchasing property.

Nitin Gadkari to launch Electronic Toll Collection systemtomorrowBy: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 30, 2014 2:45 pm
The government will unveil the Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) System for Delhi-Mumbai Highway on Thursday.
Minister of Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari will launch the new system.
ETC has already been installed at 55 Toll Plazas and their integration with Central Clearing House (CCH) operators has almost been completed on the Delhi-Mumbai route via Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra.
A pilot project for interoperable ETC system of 10 toll plazas between Mumbai (Charoti) and Ahmedabad has already been tested and seamless ETC on this section is successfully in operation.
The central government has issued orders to incorporate ETC lanes as a mandatory clause in the contracts awarded for all the highways projects in future.
For implementing ETC across the country, a new company under Company’s Act 1956, with equity participation from NHAI (25 per cent), concessionaires (50 per cent) and financial institutions (25 per cent) has already been constituted. The name of the new company is “Indian Highways Management Company Limited”.
The company’s objectives include collection of toll through ETC and to manage the project and commercially provide services of central ETC system.
Necessary amendments have already been made in the Central Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989 for fitment of Radio Frequency Identification tag on vehicles for ETC.

Findings show diabetes triples the risk that a person will develop TB
Smriti Kak Ramachandran
The Hindu “Diabetes is skyrocketing globally, projected to increase from 382 million cases in 2013 to 592 million cases in 2035.”

Diabetes triples the risk that a person will develop tuberculosis, claims a new report by the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (The Union) and the World Diabetes Foundation. The report that screened TB patients in India for diabetes mellitus (DM) shows significantly higher rates of diabetes among TB patients than the general population and cautions against a co-epidemic of TB and diabetes. 
“Diabetes is skyrocketing globally, projected to increase from 382 million cases in 2013 to 592 million cases in 2035,” the report says, adding in India 109 million people between the age of 29 and 79 are projected to be living with diabetes in the year 2035. 
The report ‘The Looming Co-epidemic of TB-Diabetes: A Call to Action’ cautions that if the trend of TB patients with diabetes going unnoticed continues, the consequence will be an increasing number of people who develop tuberculosis as a result of diabetes; potentially reversing the progress made against TB over the last few decades. 
Of 8,269 TB patients diagnosed and initiated on treatment in participating facilities in India as part of the study, 8,109 (98 per cent) were assessed for DM and 1084 (13 per cent) were found to have it. 
 
“In places where this issue has been studied—from India to China to East Africa and the United States—we’re seeing significantly higher rates of diabetes among TB patients than what appears in the general population. If we don’t act now to head this off, we’re going to experience a co-epidemic of TB-diabetes that will impact millions and sap public health systems of precious resources,” said Dr. Anil Kapur, member of the Board of Directors of the World Diabetes Foundation.
 
The report says despite a successful national TB programme, it is likely in India, the diabetes epidemic is hampering TB control efforts. “Three recently published clinical research studies in South India in about 1500 patients with TB found a high prevalence of DM: about 25 per cent in Tamil Nadu and about 44 per cent in Kerala,” says the report.
India has the highest global number of TB cases, estimated at 2.2 million per annum in the world, according to WHO, which has revealed a new treatment drug to stem the prevalence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) Tuberculosis, but has cautioned that its use must be preceded by following a set of guideline issued by it.
 

Woman harassed over 100 times in 10 hours on New York streets speaks outNew York woman who was harassed 100 times in 10 hours gets rape threats

A video that shows a woman being harassed by men on the streets of New York over 100 times within 10 hours has gone viral. The actor, Shoshana Roberts, has now spoken out on her entire experience that has been created to heighten awareness of street harassment.
Roberts and her friend secretly recorded her walking through the streets of New York City in jeans and a T-shirt as man after man greets her with remarks such as "hey, baby" or "hey, beautiful”. When she does not respond, she is admonished for being rude with comments such as "smile" or "somebody's acknowledging you for being beautiful. You should say thank you more."
The actress describes the motive as, “The frequency is something alarming, and people might know that this was happening but not to the degree that it actually is."

The two-minute video called '10 Hours of Walking in NYC as a Woman' has been viewed over 13 million times since being uploaded to YouTube on Tuesday. As views of the video skyrocketed, Roberts said she had received violent threats online. "The majority of the reactions by email were positive but unfortunately a few ones were negative, involving hurting me, killing me. I'm going to go to the police because I don't feel safe," the actress added.
The video has been produced for charity Hollaback!, which works to end street harassment endured by women and minority groups. The charity said Roberts was also threatened with rape in some comments to the YouTube post. Hollaback! executive director said, "We want this video to show people who are harassed that they are not alone, that we have their back. And for the people doing the harassing, want them to see the impact that this has on us."
Roberts said pestering is a daily reality, which may not always be verbal.

Naqvi held in Bengal during BJP team s visit to violence-hit MakraComments
Members of a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) team were briefly arrested on Thursday as it tried to enter Makra village in Bengal where three persons were killed on Monday when alleged Trinamool Congress workers tried to recapture the village which has reportedly turned to the BJP since the Lok Sabha polls.
 
Party vice-president Mukthar Abbas Naqvi, Lok Sabha MPs Kirti Azad and Udit Raj, state party president Rahul Sinha and others allegedly tried to defy security restrictions to enter the village 200km away from Kolkata in south Bengal.
West Bengal's home department had this morning sent a fax to the BJP office in Kolkata, asking the politicians not to enter Makra and adjoining villages where Section 144, a law restricting the assembly of people, has been imposed.
 
"If the state government put half the effort they are putting in arresting us into curbing terrorism, the state of West Bengal would have been in a better condition," said Naqvi before being taken to a police station in a bus.
 
"The state government has clamped Section 144 to prevent us from entering the village. If the police allowed four of us to enter, it would not have violated the Section. The government is just trying to prevent the villagers from speaking to us and breaking its own law in the process," said Sinha.
 
"We have been stuffed in a bus. I can't even say how many of us have been arrested," said state BJP spokesperson Ritesh Tiwari over phone.
 
Hundreds of villagers protested against the police and demanded that they be allowed to speak to the BJP leaders. The BJP team came to Kolkata on Thursday morning and is supposed to go back and submit a report to party president Amit Shah.
Police released all the BJP leaders and supporters after half an hour.
 
On Wednesday, teams from the state Congress, state BJP and the Left parties were prevented from entering the village.

Terming lieutenant governor Najeeb Jung's move to talk to all political parties on forming a government in Delhi as "positive", the Supreme Court on Thursday adjourned hearing on the matter to November 11.
"There could be a minority government with outside support of a political outfit. Let us wait for some time," the Supreme Court said while hearing a plea from the Aam Aadmi Party on dissolving the assembly and holding fresh polls in Delhi.
Referring to recent media reports, a five-judge constitution bench headed by Chief Justice HL Dattu said, "Whatever I have read in newspapers, it appears that the L-G has made positive moves."  
The bench asked Prashant Bhushan, counsel for AAP, to file a plea seeking dissolution of the Assembly, to wait for sometime as the L-G had started the consultation process with the political players in the national capital and adjourned the matter till November 11.
During the brief hearing, the bench also comprising justices J Chelameswar, A K Sikri, R K Agrawal and Arun Mishra, said that if the LG feels that there is a possibility of government formation, then he should be given time to explore it.
L-G Najeeb Jung, who returned from abroad Wednesday,  had met Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and called the BJP, Congress and AAP to discuss any possibility of forming a government.
"In view of the President's approval to explore the possibility of installing a popular government in Delhi, the Lt Governor would be exploring the possibilities with the leaders of all political parties over the next few days," LG's office had said.
BJP, which is the single largest party, is yet to give any clear signal on its strategy but there were indications that the party was preparing for fresh polls in January or February.
Sources said BJP president Amit Shah and Union ministers Nitin Gadkari and Rajnath Singh were in favour of the party forming a government while some others were of the view that it should not run away from polls when Prime Minister Narendra Modi's rating was high.
"There is a possibility of the party turning down offer of government formation," a senior party leader told PTI.
The L-G's decision to begin consultations with the political parties came a day after a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice H L Dattu slammed the Centre and the Lt Governor for delay in taking a decision on government formation in Delhi.
AAP and Congress had come down hard on Jung, questioning his move to hold consultation with the parties when it was clear that no party was in a position to provide a stable government.
Currently BJP, along with ally Akali Dal's lone MLA, has 29 legislators and will require the support of five more MLAs to prove majority in the 67-member assembly if it decides to form the government.

Jalandhar mob plays judge  ties up and assaults Africans for  stealingJalandhar mob plays judge, ties up and assaults Africans for 'stealing'
Ravinder Vasudeva , Hindustan Times  Jalandhar, October 30, 2014

A court in Punjab on Wednesday remanded to judicial custody two Africans, who were tied to pole with a rope for an hour and beaten up by a mod and policemen for allegedly trying to steal money from a shop.
At a time a debate is raging on hate crimes following Africans nationals in Delhi crying discrimination, the case has hogged the headlines for the treatment meted out to the youth.
They were identified as Irakarama Aiaier, a resident of Rwanda, and Sinarinli Alain, a resident of Burundi. Aiaier, Alain and one Ncuti Roger, another Rwanda resident, are accused of an attempted robbery on Tuesday at a grocery shop in Jalandhar.
While the first two were held, Roger managed to escape.

Even though the arrested have claimed to be students of bachelor of computer applications course at Lovely Professional University (LPU), the university authorities have denied this.
"They are not our students right now. The two arrested were the BCA second year students in the university till March last year, but then they stopped coming to the university," said LPU deputy director Aman Mittal.
The police conducted on Wednesday raids at the paying guest accommodation in where the three were staying.
The police investigation found the two arrested were living in Jalandhar, even as their visa expired a few months ago and they had not applied for an extension.
The police have also sent e-mails to the embassies of Burundi and Rwanda to find out the status of their visa details.
Meanwhile, the assault on the two African nationals has triggered a debate, putting the spotlight on the role of the authorities concerned in such cases. This is the third major case involving African students in the state in as many years. They were tied to a pole with a rope and assaulted for an hour before the police intervened.
In April 2012, Yannick Ntibateganya, a Burundi national, was brutally beaten up by nine locals. He died in June this year after remaining in coma for more than two years.
In June 2013, police booked 21 African students following a brawl with a Jalandhar-based resident.
Local BJP MLA Manoranjan Kalia said, "I am surprised at the casual way in which the local police have been dealing with the presence of foreign students. Why are the police not maintaining a proper record of their presence in different localities? The educational institutes must keep the local administration updated about the whereabouts of these students."

On creation of new post, it said that there will be a ban on creation of Plan and Non-Plan posts. At the same time, posts that have remained vacant for more than a year are not to be revived except under very rare and unavoidable circumstances and after seeking the clearance of Expenditure Department.
Giving logic for such measures, the memorandum said that these are intended at promoting fiscal discipline, without restricting the operational efficiency of the Government. “In the context of the current fiscal situation, there is a need to continue to rationalise expenditure and optimise available resources,” it said.
Indirect tax collection
These measures have been announced after indirect tax collection grew mere 5.8 per cent during first six months of the current fiscal against the budgeted target of 25.8 per cent.
Though gross direct tax collection registered a growth of 15 per cent in line with the budgeted target of 15 per cent, the rate of growth for net collection (gross collection minus refund) was mere 7 per cent.
On non-tax revenue, good news is that lower crude prices and de-regulation of diesel prices is expected to have a very positive impact on subsidy payout. However, the Government is yet to kick off disinvestment plan.

Mangalore, Oct 30:  
Following a directive to the major ports from the Union Ministry of Shipping to give priority for coastal shipping activities, New Mangalore port handled first coastal cargo to Lakshadweep Island on Thursday.
In this regard, m.v. PFS Prosperity berthed at the port on October 27 to load building materials to the island. The ship left for Lakshadweep on Thursday.
A press release by the New Mangalore Port Trust (NMPT) said here that this is the first coastal movement of cargo to Minicoy in Lakshadweep Island from New Mangalore port. Hitherto these cargoes were going through Old Mangalore port (a minor port in Karnataka) and other neighbouring ports.
MK Shipping is the stevedores and clearing and forwarding agent for the cargo. Export Marine Services of Mangalore is the exporter of the entire consignment, it said.
The release said that the Union Ministry of Shipping has issued new guidelines under which ports will have to give priority berthing to dry bulk and general cargo coastal vessels, irrespective of the origin and final destination of the cargo, in order to save on fuel cost, and to de-congest railways and road transport, and to promote water transport.
Accordingly, all 12 major ports have been directed to earmark exclusive berths and green channel for coastal cargo to promote the sector, it said.
In this direction, NMPT has also initiated steps for promoting the coastal movement of cargo, the release added.

Gold falls to 3-week low after Fed ends bond-buyingGold falls to 3-week low after Fed ends bond-buying
Reuters
Tweet
Singapore, Oct 30:  
Gold fell to a three-week low on Thursday after the US Federal Reserve ended its bond-buying stimulus programme and expressed confidence in the economic recovery, dimming bullion’s safe-haven appeal.
The strength of the dollar, which hit a 3-1/2-week high against a basket of major currencies after the Fed statement, also hurt bullion.
Ending its monthly bond purchases, the Fed dropped a characterisation of US labour market slack as “significant’’ in a show of confidence in the economy’s prospects.
In a statement on Wednesday after a two-day meeting, the central bank had largely dismissed financial market volatility, a slowdown in Europe and a weak inflation outlook as factors that might undercut progress towards its unemployment and inflation goals.
“The announcement struck us as coming across more hawkish than what the market was expecting,’’ said INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir.
Fed rate hike
Gold, often seen as an alternative investment during economic and financial uncertainty, fell on fears the vote of confidence in the recovery could prompt the Fed to raise interest rates soon.
Bullion, as a non-interest-bearing asset, could take a hit when higher rates are in place.
US GDP data
“We think the next shoe to drop will come on Thursday when US GDP numbers for the third quarter will be released. If the number comes in higher than 3 per cent, as we suspect it will, we would not rule out another round of heavy selling in gold that could see us revisit the old lows of $1,180,’’ Meir said.
Spot gold, gold futures
Spot gold fell to $1,205.35 an ounce on Thursday - its lowest since October 8 - before recovering slightly to trade down 0.4 per cent at $1,206.88 by 0631 GMT. The metal, which hit a 15-month low of $1,183.46 earlier this month, fell 1.3 per cent on Wednesday.
US gold futures fell as much as 1.6 per cent to $1,205.20.
The US Commerce Department will release the gross domestic product figures at 1230 GMT. The economy is expected to have grown at a solid 3 per cent annual rate in the third quarter.
In a reflection of investor sentiment, SPDR Gold Trust , the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings fell 0.16 per cent to 742.40 tonnes on Wednesday, a six-year low. The outflows could undermine any possible rally in gold.
In the physical markets, too, buying interest fell. Premiums in top consumer China were about $1-$1.50 an ounce on Thursday, compared with about $2 on Wednesday.
“With the heightened negative sentiment, we expect to see even more scaled-up selling from the speculative community as well as producers who have been active on rallies over the last few weeks,’’ said Alex Thorndike, senior trader at MKS Group.

Sensex jumps 163 points; realty  IT stocks steal the showSensex surges 248 points to end at new high of 27,346; Nifty gains 79 points
Our Bureau/Agencies
Tweet
Mumbai, Oct 30:  
Led by the recent economic reforms announced by the government, the benchmark BSE Sensex surged 248.16 points to end at a new closing peak of 27,346.33 and the NSE index Nifty rose 78.75 points at 8,169.20.
Domestic sentiment was buoyed on increased buying by investors as the recent economic reforms have instilled confidence that the country can better withstand potential rate hikes in the US.
Sectoral indices
All BSE sectoral indices ended in the green. Among them, realty index was the star-performer and was up 3.44 per cent, followed by IT 2.04 per cent, TECk 1.77 per cent and oil & gas 1.65 per cent.
Gainers, losers
Reliance, TCS, Hindalco, Infosys and GAIL were the top five gainers among 30-share Sensex constituents, while the top five losers were SSLT, M&M, Cipla, Tata Power and Hero MotoCorp.
FDI rules relaxed
Among the recent economic reforms, the Government had yesterday relaxed FDI rules in the construction sector by reducing the minimum built-up area as well as capital requirement and easing the exit norms. Sharess of realty companies, particularly those with high debt, such as Unitech, DLF and Puravankara climbed after the announcement.
Global markets
The dollar surged to a three-week high, bond yields rose and gold fell on Thursday after the US Federal Reserve ended its six-year quantitative easing bond-buying programme.
The decision was widely expected, but a relatively hawkish tone to the accompanying statement was not. It prompted financial markets to rethink the growing consensus that the Fed's first interest rate hike would be late in 2015.
Stock market reaction was more mixed. Asian shares mostly fell, following a slight decline on Wall Street overnight. European bourses opened higher on Thursday, helped by encouraging corporate earnings, but quickly turned negative.
Overnight borrowing costs
In a statement on Wednesday after a two-day meeting, the Fed retained its basic guidance that overnight borrowing costs would remain near zero for a "considerable time".
But it dropped a characterisation of the US labour market slack as "significant" in a show of confidence in the economy's prospects, which markets perceived as a slightly hawkish turn.
In early European trade the dollar index, a broad measure of the greenback's trade-weighted value, was up 0.5 percent above 86.4.
European equity markets initially welcomed the Fed's statement as a sign that the US economy is in good shape, rather than taking fright at the prospect of interest rates perhaps rising sooner than had been expected.
But at 0930 GMT the EuroFirst 300 index of leading shares was down 0.1 per cent at 1317 points. Germany's DAX was down 0.4 per cent and France's CAC40 was down 0.1 per cent, shrugging off upbeat corporate updates from Alcatel Lucent, Technip and Renault.
Britain's FTSE 100 was down 0.5 per cent, and U. futures pointed to Wall Street opening around 0.2 per cent lower.

"If I See a Leadership Book on a Leader s Desk  I ll Fire Her!"reddit
In the news some weeks ago, we read an interview with a well-known top executive from Finland. He had just visited Oslo to share his thoughts about leadership. He came through as a wise man, with many insights about leadership easy to agree with. Except one thing - he said that there was no use in reading about leadership. Actually, according to the article, he said that if you had a leader in your team and saw a book about leadership on his desk, the best you could do was to fire him/her. Well, no rules without exceptions, he himself enhanced his own leadership skills by referring to an old book about military behavior.
Well, we found this to be a peculiar story in today's business world. And if we look behind the words, what do we find?
Is it true that he fires people that read leadership literature? We do not know, but probably not. Is it true that people do not need leadership literature? Definitely not. Shared knowledge and wisdom is the easiest way to evolve, and should for sure not be avoided. As everywhere else, there is excellent leadership literature as well as books or articles not worth the paper they are written on.
Is this based on fear? Fear for what's new, fear for not being good enough, fear for change? Well, this is difficult to know. But given how many people struggle with change, it would not surprise us.
When change hits us straight in the face, the easiest thing we can do is to resist it. Today we see that leadership is a subject for massive change, and no wonder why it is easier to make fun of this change instead of embracing it.  We meet this all the time:
"To define what leadership actually is can be hard enough, and now people start talking about future leadership!", "What does this mean?", "Why can we not just lead as we used to do?"
So what is Future Leadership? Or Radical Management? Or Purpose Leadership? Or Lean In Leadership? Management 2.0? Are we talking about something completely new?
The right answer would be "Yes! And No." The corporate world is constantly changing, but from time to time the change is so substantial, we talk about it as a paradigm shift.  Paradigm shift or not, professors, experts, and leaders have been talking about a new level of leadership for some time now. Dr. Gary Hamel, one of the most influential business thinkers, calls it Management 2.0, and claims it is time to reinvent management. It does not mean to never use anything you knew about leadership again, but to add an extra set of skills - suitable to meet the demands of the future.
Important organizational drivers are changing at an accelerating speed. We are able to collaborate and co-create in way's we have never seen before. Knowledge is no longer a scarcity, but the ability to adapt knowledge and put it into use has become an important success factor for both organizations and individuals.
Some of the basic needs of the employees are still the same: The need to be understood, seen and heard by their supervisors. And by entering the purpose-economy, employees need to be able to connect both their brain and their hearts to the values and mission of the corporation they choose to work for.
Centralized power and steep hierarchies will not be the winning recipe for the future. The power will not lie in your title but in your ability to utilize and facilitate the collective competence and knowledge within the organization. Future leaders have to let go of their control and power.
As a leader it is your responsibility to make sure you are on a personal constant improvement strategy. Your biggest asset will be your ability to change and improve, yourself and your team.  Change is the denominator for growth on all levels.
A paradigm shift or not, you have the choice to take on your curiosity-googles, lean in and start to figure out how to adapt. And then the relevant important question arise:
How to do this?
- Well, leadership literature is for sure a start. Dig in!
- Use the Internet. Connect with relevant groups, share your knowledge and insights, and start exploring the new possibilities.
- Do not be afraid of change, embrace it instead. Be curious and see if there is something in it that fit for you. Maybe you can become the leader for someone else that you wished you had when you were younger.
- Keep reading, keep learning, keep discussing. Hopefully the next time this Finnish top executive walks past a new book about leadership, he picks it up and asks to borrow it.
What do you think? Would you fire someone because of this?

company information
Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, on Wednesday, reported a 17 per cent dip in consolidated net profit at Rs.574 crore in the second quarter ended September 30 against Rs.690 crore in the same period last fiscal.
However, revenues improved by 7 per cent to Rs.3,587 crore at the said quarter, Chief Financial Officer Saumen Chakraborty said at a press conference here on Wednesday.
When asked about the erosion in margins, Chief Operating Officer Abhijit Mukherjee attributed it to the absence of ‘meaningful launches’ during the six months of the current financial year and also due to the price erosion as a consequence of its customers getting consolidated. Also, it was because approvals in North America were rather broadly slower than before, he pointed out.
“When customers get consolidated, there is always an erosion because we cannot sell the same product to different customers at different prices,” Mr. Mukherjee said, adding that he was confident of a better second half this fiscal than the first, with more product launches.

Grasim Industries, an Aditya Birla Group company, reported lower consolidated net profit of Rs 416 crore for the second quarter ended September 30, 2014, as compared to Rs. 450 crore in the same period last year.
This was due to higher interest and depreciation charges on account of the commissioning of projects at its cement and VSF divisions and the acquisition of 4.8 million tonne per annum cement capacity in Gujarat in the first quarter.
During the quarter the company’s revenue grew by 16 per cent to Rs. 7,945 crore from Rs. 6,850 crore in the year-ago period driven by volume growth in all the businesses supported by new and acquired capacities.
On a standalone basis the net profit was sharply lower at Rs. 299 crore for the quarter ended September 30, 2014, as compared to Rs. 413 crore in the same period in the previous year. Total income increased to Rs. 1,811 crore from Rs. 1,627 crore.
The company’s VSF business achieved record sales volume of more than one lakh tonne, supported by the commissioning of two lines at Vilayat, Gujarat. The chemicals business reported volume growth of 28 per cent. Cement sales at its subsidiary UltraTech Cement was up 10 per cent at 10.92 million tonne. Costs were impacted on account of increase in prices of petcoke, input and higher freight cost.
Tech Mahindra
Tech Mahindra has reported a negligible growth in consolidated net profit at Rs. 720 crore in the second quarter ended September 30, 2014, as compared to Rs. 718 crore in the year-ago period.

During the quarter the company hired 2,580 professionals and had a total headcount of 95,309.

 “We have had a great first half driven by strong growth in the U.S., India, Japan and our API business. Our research pipeline is evolving well and we expect significant developments in the dermatology and inhalation space in the quarters to come,” said Nilesh Gupta, Managing Director, Lupin.
 On a standalone basis, the company’s net profit dropped to Rs.459 crore during the quarter from Rs.809 crore. Total income has declined from Rs.2,541 crore to Rs.2,348 crore for the quarter ended September 30, 2014.

The company received orders during the quarter worth Rs.1,421 crore as compared to an order intake of Rs.1,762 crore . “Order intake during the quarter remained subdued as few large orders were awarded and some are awaiting contract closure,” the company said in a statement.

The Centre has decided to review all the pending port-related projects in Tamil Nadu.
Several infrastructure projects with crores of investment are lying idle in the State. The list includes Chennai Port- Maduravoyal elevated four-lane link road, Ennore Manali Road Improvement Project, Chennai Port Outer Harbour Project and Sethusamudram Project, among others.
The Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways, Shipping, Nitin Gadkari along with his officials will inspect these projects on November 3 and 4. He will also hold parleys with National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) officials on the pending projects.
He is also expected to visit to two major ports (Chennai and Kamarajar) and two non-major ports (L&T Kattupalli and Krishnapatnam), L&T Shipyard, Indian Maritime University. He will also interact with members of Madras Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Sethusamudram Shipping Canal Project, Madurai and Ramnad districts.
“This is the first visit of the Shipping Minister to major ports and after a gap of eight months. Besides, it is also the maiden visit to non-major ports. As it is a short visit, we may not be able to have full-length deliberations on any particular subject. We will urge him to complete these projects on a war-footing to solve the congestion issue,” port official said.

Centre open to revising MSME investment limitsNEW DELHI, October 30, 2014

Centre open to revising MSME investment limits
Mahim Pratap Singh
interior policy
The Narendra Modi Government is actively considering revising the investment caps for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), and can soon work out a system to implement government programs for the sector through accredited industry associations.
MSME Secretary Madhav Lal said the government was looking to revise the caps on investment limits for the MSME sector.
“We have received several representations about the revision of investment limits...some have even argued for including other factors besides capital,” Mr. Lal told The Hindu on the sidelines of the seventh national cluster summit, organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) here on Wednesday.
The current investment caps, defined by the Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises Development (MSMED) Act, 2006, stand at Rs.25 lakh for micro; more than Rs.25 lakh to Rs.5 crore for small; and over Rs.5 crore to Rs.10 crore for medium enterprises in the manufacturing sector. For MSMEs in the services sector, these limits are less than Rs.10 lakh, over Rs.10 lakh to Rs.2 crore and over Rs.2 crore to Rs.5 crore, respectively.
“However, any such move can only be brought about by amending the MSMED Act,” said Mr. Lal.
He also said the Ministry, based on its experiences with accredited industry associations, could work out a system to implement government schemes for the sector through these associations.
In August, the Ministry, in partnership with the Quality Council of India and Deutsche Gesellsschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), had launched an accreditation system for industry associations and business membership organisations (BMOs)
Mr. Lal said the MSMEs would play a major role in Mr. Modi’s flagship ‘Make in India’ initiative.
“MSMEs are already contributing 8 per cent to the manufacturing GDP, 45 per cent to manufacturing output, 40 per cent to exports...but we have to improve competitiveness of the entire manufacturing and value chain of the sector,” he said.
“That’s why we are looking to strengthen professional relationships in this sector (using the accreditation system). If an association is capable of supporting its members then many government programs could be routed through these associations,” he said.
Mr. Lal said lessons from China, if any, would have to be tweaked according to local conditions.
“It is important to focus on the value addition component and not just on expansion of manufacturing base because they have a lot of opportunities in the global market and hence will face challenges of innovation, efficiency of business models and the like,” he said.

Sensex @ life high; outshines global peers post QE era
Kshitij Anand, ECONOMICTIMES.COM Oct 30, 2014, 12.47PM IST
(Tracking the momentum,…)
NEW DELHI: The S&P BSE Sensex rallied over 260 points in intraday trade on Thursday to hit a fresh record high of 27388, at a time when other Asian markets were trading mixed after the Federal Reserve overnight ended its monthly bond-buying program that quadrupled its balance sheet to $4.4 trillion.
The S&P BSE Sensex hit its all-time high after a flat start, led by gains in realty stocks, Infosys, TCS, HDFC and Dr Reddy's Laboratories.
The previous all-time high for Sensex was 27,354.99.
At 1:10 p.m.; the 30-share index was at 27296.78, up 219.10 points or 0.81 per cent. It touched a high of 27,358.85 and a low of 27,088.65 in early trade ..
Tracking the momentum, the 50-share Nifty index also managed to reclaim its crucial psychological level of 8150, led by gains in realty, IT and consumer durable stocks.
However, the rupee depreciated by 19 paise to 61.54 against the US currency in early trade at the Interbank Foreign Exchange today due to the dollar's gain against other currencies overseas.
At 01:20 p.m.; BSE Sensex was trading 201 points higher at 27,999. While, Nifty was up 63 points at 8150.40.
Overnight, the US markets ended marginally lower, while the Asian markets were trading mixed. Japan's Nikkei 225 index was trading 0.80 per cent higher at 15,676 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was trading 0.63 per cent lower at 23,668.
South Korea's Kospi index was trading 0.32 per cent lower at 1,954 and China's Shanghai index was trading 0.62 per cent higher at 2,387.
On expected lines, the US Federal Reserve announced the end of its economic stimulus, known as quantitative easing, on Wednesday. The program was launched during the financial crisis in 2008 to stabilize the economy and support the financial system, which pushed the asset prices higher across the world.
The US Federal Reserve has held rates near zero since December 2008 and has more than quadrupled its balance sheet to $4.4 trillion through three separate asset purchase programs, says a Reuters report.
According to experts, the Federal Reserve did reiterate its plan to maintain its benchmark short-term rate near zero "for a considerable time," but investors were hoping for more dovish commentary from the Fed and that's why most of the global markets were trading mixed.
"Pulling out of the quantitative easing was kind of expected and that has gone by the plan; but the market was expecting them to give somewhat dovish comment about postponing the possible interest rate hike in the US and that did not happen," said Vikas Khemani of Edelweiss Financial Services.
"That comfort did not come and probably, that risk still continues to remain on the markets. So to that extent, the markets would be disappointed, but I do not think anything would change significantly at this point in time as far as Indian markets are concerned," he added.
The risk still remains more for emerging markets than for India because of relative stable macro picture as and when US Federal Reserve decides to hike interest rates in near future. Analysts say more sharp swings in stocks are likely as that day draws closer.
"The Fed did reiterate its plan to maintain its benchmark short-term rate near zero 'for a considerable time'. Most economists predict the Fed won't raise that rate, which affects many consumer and business loans, before June," AP said in a report.
Not just in India, investors across the globe are worried about the fact that when the US Fed plans to raise interest rates, it could impact foreign institutional inflows. So far in October, FIIs have net sold shares worth Rs 3,200 crore in the Indian markets.
Yes, volatility cannot be ruled out. But the flow of money will go on and India happens to be in a sweet spot compared to the rest of the emerging market economies, they say.
"It is a given that QE is going to end from the US, but at the same time, ECB is looking to start another round of QE. Bank of Japan will come up with another QE, but the dollar is going to be strong and it is the dollar that determines the liquidity in the world," said Rahul Chadha, Co-CIO of Mirae Asset Global Investments.
"The way we look at it is that countries which do the necessary reforms will get the capital because there is going to be enough capital in the world. Thus, it is not a question of everybody getting free money, which is why we remain more confident about India than other economies like Brazil, Russia, etc," he added.
India's long-term story intact:
One thing which experts feel very firmly is the fact that India happens to be in a sweet spot and the whole India story remains intact.
Experts feel that India is more prepared than before to face hike in the US interest rates sometime next year. It will only be a sentimental pull back which should be used as buying opportunity by long-term investors.
India has managed to hold onto its macro factors which is very good thing, when compared with the rest of the emerging market economies and that will aide capital flow.

Posting photo of your young daughter wearing Game of Thrones T-shirt  not a threat of violenceFrom the college’s letter to Prof. Francis Schmidt :
This letter acknowledges that Bergen Community College (“BCC”) may have lacked basis to sanction you for your January 12, 2014 Google+ post of your daughter wearing a Game of Thrones t-shirt (the “Incident”). By sanctioning you as it did, BCC may have unintentionally erred and potentially violated your constitutional rights, including under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
Upon further reflection on this matter and in order to bring this issue to closure, BCC will strike and remove from your employment file any adverse record in connection with this Incident, including without limitation Mr. James Miller’s January 16, 2014 email and Ms. Patti Bonomolo’s January 24, 2014 email. Likewise, any penalty or restriction you may have suffered in connection with this Incident, including as set forth in Ms. Bonomolo’s January 24, 2014 email, is hereby rescinded and acknowledged to be null and void. Part and parcel of this acknowledgement, the Incident shall not be considered in any future BCC decisions concerning your employment, including without limitation any decisions relating to promotion, sabbatical, compensation, or any future disciplinary proceeding. In sum, you will be in good standing with BCC as if the Incident never occurred, and BCC’s records shall so reflect.
Lest there be any doubt, BCC recognizes and respects that you are free to exercise your constitutional rights, including your right to freedom of speech and expression, even to the extent that you may disparage BCC and/or its officials. Going forward, we ask simply that you abide by the rules, policies, and procedures that are generally applicable — to the extent consistent with constitutional and other legal commands — to all other members of BCC’s faculty.
Here’s the initial report from Colleen Flaherty (Inside Higher Ed) on the incident in April of this year;
Francis Schmidt, a professor of art and animation, … posted [on Google+] a picture of his young daughter doing yoga in a T-shirt with the new “Game of Thrones” season tagline in January, upon release of the trailer….
But one contact — a dean — who was notified automatically via Google that the picture had been posted apparently took it as a threat. In an e-mail, Jim Miller, the college’s executive director for human resources, told Schmidt to meet with him and two other administrators immediately in light of the “threatening e-mail.” …
Schmidt said he met with the administrators, including a security official, in one of their offices and was questioned repeatedly about the picture’s meaning and the popularity of “Game of Thrones.”
Schmidt said Miller asked him to use Google to verify the phrase, which he did, showing approximately 4 million hits. The professor said he asked why the photo had set off such a reaction, and that the security official said that “fire” could be a kind of proxy for “AK-47s.”
Despite Schmidt’s explanation, he was notified via e-mail later in the week that he was being placed on leave without pay, effective immediately, and that he would have to be cleared by a psychiatrist before he returned to campus. Schmidt said he was diagnosed with depression in 2007 but was easily cleared for this review, although even the brief time away from campus set back his students, especially those on independent study.
Schmidt believes he was targeted in part because he filed a grievance against the college a week before the post for being passed up for a sabbatical….
[Bergen Community College President Kay] Walter said she did not believe that the college had acted unfairly, especially considering that there were three school shootings nationwide in January, prior to Schmidt’s post.

BEIJING: China's Xiaomi Inc has become the world's third-largest smartphone vendor in just three years after first hitting the market, trailing only Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Apple Inc , according to a new industry study.
Strategy Analytics said Xiaomi accounted for 6 per cent of all 320 million smartphones shipped during July-September. Samsung made up 25 per cent, down from 35 per cent a year earlier due to rising competition from several directions.
Apple's share also fell slightly to 12 per cent.
"Xiaomi was the star performer," Strategy Analytics Executive Director Neil Mawston said in a statement.
"Samsung continues to face tough competition from Apple at the higher-end of the smartphone market, from Xiaomi and Huawei in the middle-tiers, and from Lenovo and others at the entry-level."
Xiaomi has been the top seller in its home market of China and recently entered India, where it sells phones exclusively through e-commerce site Flipkart.
Vice President Hugo Barra told Reuters in Bangalore last month that the company aimed to sell 100,000 phones a week in India in October when the country celebrates Diwali.

Curb anti-national forces  BJP tells Mamata govtcrisis
With the violence hit area in Birbhum made out of bounds, BJP on Thursday stepped up its attack on Trinamool Congress government saying instead of stopping Opposition, it should use its energy for “curbing anti-national forces” working in West Bengal.
BJP national vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, who was leading a three-member party team to Makra in Birbhum district where TMC and BJP supporters clashed leading to death of three persons last Monday, said the state Home department has asked them not to proceed as prohibitory orders were in force there but they would not change their plan.
“After we were informed of this communication, we decided we will carry on with our programme and we are not afraid if we are arrested there,” Mr. Naqvi said.
BJP, Congress and CPI (M) teams were stopped from entering the village on Wednesday citing prohibitory orders in force in the area since Monday.
Asking the state government to deal firmly with anti-national activities, Mr. Naqvi alleged that, “The Trinamool Congress government is synonymous with terrorists and mafia and they are letting the anti-national forces to use the land of Bengal for terrorist activities.
“The kind of energy the Trinamool Congress government is spending on stopping the opposition parties from entering Bengal, if they had used ten per cent of that energy in curbing anti-national forces working in Bengal, then it would have been great for the country and the state,” Mr. Naqvi told reporters here before leaving for Makra village.
Enroute to the village, Mr. Naqvi said, “We got a call at our party office a few minutes back in which the state Home department asked our party functionaries not to proceed to Makra in Birbhum district as prohibitory orders under section 144 CrPC was in force there.”
When asked about media reports claiming that the terror module unearthed in Bengal was planning to assassinate Bangladesh premier Sheikh Hasina and opposition leader Khaleda Zia, Naqvi said “these reports are not only of national concern but also have implications on diplomatic ties.”
The BJP delegation comprising Mr. Naqvi and MPs Kirti Azad and Udit Raj will submit a full-fledged report about the incident to the party’s central leadership.

The accused, including the former chairman of the scam-tainted company, B. Ramalinga Raju, were present in the court for a brief while. The defence contended that the evidence could not be admissible because it was not gathered in tune with the provisions of the Evidence Act.
The Special Court trying the case pertaining to the Satyam Computer Services scam here on Thursday, posted it to December 23. In all probability, the Court will pronounce the judgement on that day in the six year-old case.
Earlier, the court heard arguments from the defence counsel challenging the authenticity of the electronically-gathered evidence that was presented by the prosecution, the Central Bureau of Investigation that investigated the fraud.
The accused, including the former chairman of the scam-tainted company, B. Ramalinga Raju, were present in the court on Thursday for a brief while. The defence counsel had recently filed a petition in Court asking to hear arguments over some of the evidence produced by the prosecution.
The defence contended that the evidence could not be admissible because it was not gathered in tune with the provisions of the Evidence Act. The defence appeared to be banking on a Supreme Court judgement of last month saying electronic evidence that was not documented properly was not admission in Court, without complying with the Evidence Act.
Accordingly, the defence felt that electronic documents not gathered in tune with the law of the country could not be produced in Court. This meant that evidence including telephone call data records, emails and bank account statements needed to be verified as authentic while being submitted as hard copies, as hard evidence, to the Court.

High Court seeks replies from Centre, Enforcement Directorate on Gautam Khaitan's bail plea

bail plea
(According to CBI and other…)
NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court today sought response of the Centre and the Enforcement Directorate on the bail plea of businessman Gautam Khaitan, arrested last month in a money laundering case related to the Rs 3,600-crore VVIP chopper deal .
Justice V P Vaish issued notice to Ministry of Finance and Enforcement Directorate (ED) directing them to file their status report by November 7.
"Notice be issued to the respondents. They shall file the status report," the court said, adding that the reply be filed and handed over to the petitioner's counsel on November 7.
The court has now listed the matter for November 11. Khaitan, who is presently in judicial custody, moved the High Court seeking bail after a trial court on October 20 dismissed his plea saying the investigation in the case is at a "crucial stage".
Senior advocate P V Kapur and Sidharth Luthra, appearing for Khaitan, sought bail contending that he was a "soft target" and influential persons, who were also accused in the case, had not yet been arrested by ED.
The counsel also argued that his client, who is also an advocate by profession, is in custody since September 23 and it's been over 35 days since he is behind bars.
They contended that the ED has named 21 entities in the case, but till date only Khaitan has been arrested in the case.
"Till date only one (Khaitan) has been arrested and two others have been interrogated but not arrested," the counsel said, adding that former Indian Air Force chief S P Tyagi and his brothers have also been named in the case but they are still at large.
The counsel also said that Khaitan has deep roots in the society and is into a family business which is running for last 100 years, so there is no chance of his fleeing from justice and tampering with evidence in the case.
"Let them (ED and Centre) point out, why I have been kept back. During the custody also, the ED has not asked him any question," the lawyer argued.
Khaitan was arrested by the ED under the PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act). The ED had lodged a case in July against Khaitan, former IAF chief S P Tyagi and 19 others in the VVIP chopper deal case to probe alleged kickbacks.
Khaitan's counsel had submitted that in a similar case, Italian court had passed a verdict exonerating two foreign nationals accused of bribery and corruption in India and in this view, the ED's allegation that he had received kickbacks now stands "eroded".
The bail plea, however, was vehemently opposed by ED, represented by Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Sanjay Jain who contended that there was a likelihood of Khaitan fleeing from justice, tampering with evidence and hampering the ongoing probe which is at a crucial stage.
  ASG Jain and the central government standing counsel Ajay Digpaul informed the court that there is "damning evidence against him (Khaitan). He is a kingpin".
The agency also submitted that they have confiscated a laptop of Khaitan's employee, in which the data shows that several 1000 euros were passed into the accounts of Khaitan and his wife.
The agency said the recent judgement of the Italian court in the case acquitting former Finmeccanica CEO Giuseppe Orsi and ex-AgustaWestland head Bruno Spagnolini of corruption charges does not have any bearing here in the probe into a money-laundering matter.
The Italian court had on October 9 acquitted Orsi and Spagnolini of graft charges in the chopper deal with India. They, however, were sentenced to a two-year jail term on lesser charges of falsification of invoices.
ED also alleged that Khaitan was "actively involved" in the illegal transactions relating to proceeds of crime and he was one of the beneficiaries of the entire deal.
Earlier, the ED before the lower court had alleged the agency was probing the case in which 70 million Euros were paid as "kickbacks" and it was investigating the money trail and also the proceeds of crime.
The ED had submitted that Khaitan was one of the directors in Chandigarh-based company Aeromatrix, which is allegedly a front firm for the financial dealings in VVIP helicopters deal and he resigned from the post after the Italian police started its probe.
According to CBI and other agencies, they had detected that funds for the particular deal were allegedly routed through this firm and few others.
The ED had said a reference to Khaitan was also reportedly made in Italian prosecutor's report filed in a court there.
The CBI had earlier questioned him in this case. The ED had registered a case in this deal under PMLA, nearly a year after the CBI filed its case.
The ED has booked S P Tyagi, his family members, European nationals Carlo Gerosa, Christian Michel and Guido Haschke, four companies-- Italy-based Finmeccanica, UK-based AgustaWestland and Chandigarh-based IDS Infotech and Aeromatrix, two companies based in Mauritius and Tunisia -- a few other firms and unknown persons in its criminal complaint.
The supply of 12 VVIP helicopters from AgustaWestland came under the scanner after the Italian authorities alleged that bribe was paid by the company to clinch the deal.
The Italian prosecutor, who carried out the preliminary inquiry, alleged the CEO of Finmeccanica, the parent company of UK-based AgustaWestland, had allegedly used the services of middlemen to bribe Indian officials.

Save precious time tracking your investments
BERLIN: Germany's Volkswagen posted higher-than-expected operating profit in the third quarter, boosted by European and Chinese buyers of its luxury Audi and Porsche models.
Underlying earnings at Europe's largest automotive group jumped 16 per cent to 3.23 billion euros ($4.07 billion), VW said on Thursday, beating the top-end forecast of 3.09 billion euros in a Reuters poll of analysts.
Buoyed by a recovery in core European markets, the German group stuck to its guidance for a 2014 operating profit margin between 5.5 per cent and 6.5 per cent, after 5.9 per cent last year.
It also confirmed a forecast for revenue within a range of plus or minus 3 per cent of last year's record 197 billion euros. Quarterly revenues were up 4.1 per cent at 48.9 billion euros, VW said.
Volkswagen's stock rose 3.7 per cent to 168.05 euros in early trade, outperforming a 1.9 per cent increase by the autos sector .
VW's third-quarter group vehicle sales were up 4.1 per cent, at a record 2.43 million autos, with volume growth in China and Europe offsetting declines in the Americas, keeping VW on course to hit a 10 million car-sales target four years early in 2014.
Quarterly deliveries of Audi and Porsche models, which account for about two thirds of VW group earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), were up 7.2 per cent and 25 per cent respectively to 429,250 and 47,800 cars.
But operating profit at the core passenger-car brand, VW's biggest unit by sales and revenue, has tumbled as the mass-market division grapples with stagnant sales, high fixed costs and spending on technology such as VW's MQB modular production platform.
To spur earnings power at the namesake brand which is key to VW's global expansion, Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn in July announced a goal to cut costs by 5 billion euros per year from 2017, the centrepiece of an efficiency drive spanning the twelve-brand group.

" Astronomers are convinced that billions of years ago there was water on Mars and there could be a chance that life in primitive form evolved there. Europa, a satellite of Jupiter, exhibited existence of water. Now that we have reached Mars, the next test is to find out why Mars lost its atmosphere and water. What was the trigger that caused it, is the big question. Could what happened to Mars happen to Earth? " - B.G. Siddharth
TOPICS
The success of Mangalyaan has propelled India into the big league. Now, we await data and photographs from Mars to find out more about the mysterious planet.
In the future there may be colonies on Mars inhabited by Earthlings!
The discovery of water and methane has indicated a probable life form on Mars and this has resulted in a rush to explore the Red Planet that is a terrestrial planet like Earth. Doesn’t this sound like a page straight out of a Sci-Fi novel? Launched in November last year, Mangalyaan — which means ‘the vehicle to Mars’ — entered the planet’s orbit in September. This has propelled India into the big league with the Soviet Union, the U.S. and Europe.
While many countries have made attempts and others have seen failures at various stages of their mission, India successfully managed to send its spacecraft to Mars in its first attempt making this move significant.
“Mars Orbiter Mission is a technology demonstrator which shows that we can send a spacecraft to Mars. Within 10 years ISRO plans to land robots on Mars to study rocks, followed by astronauts in the next 50-60 years. Within this century, some sort of a colony to halt or refuel or serve as a check post will be pursued,” says B. G. Siddharth, Founding Director of the B. M. Birla Science Centre, Hyderabad and its subsidiary centres.
News from afar
During its stay on Mars, Mangalyaan will survey the surface of the planet and send data and photographs. Pictures of the recent dust storm on Mars will throw light on the environment of the planet.
“Mars is like a desert now. Winds are produced in its small atmosphere as the planet rotates leading to dust storms. The dust is partly rust so it looks red,” observes Dr. Siddharth. The Birla Science Centre in Hyderabad plans to have a comprehensive programme with special shows on Mars throughout the year. The Planetary Society of India has an ongoing programme titled “Mission to Mars and Beyond” in schools. In this programme various activities like sky observation, quiz, essays and talks are conducted.
 N. Sri Raghunandan Kumar, director and founder, Planetary Society of India, says, “the mission has generated interest among children and has the potential to inspire future scientists. As far as the data that comes out of the Mission on Mars, the benefits to the common man and results can be seen ten years from now.” 
“The robots will study rocks on Mars. The planet offers exhaustive scope for mining,” says Dr. Siddharth. “Helium 3, an isotope of helium, is rare on Earth and found in great quantity on moon and Mars.  It is a good source of energy for nuclear fusion.”
Long stay
Mangalyaan will remain in the Mars orbit and is expected to exceed its lifespan. It will send information to the ISRO. For details on Mars Orbiter Mission log on to the ISRO website http://www.isro.org/mars/updates.aspx.
Mangalyaan carries Mars Colour Camera, Thermal Infrared Imaging Spectrometer, Methane Sensor for Mars and Mars Exospheric Neutral Composition Analyser and Lyman Alpha Photometer.

Barclays sets aside $805 million in rigging probe... 
October 30, 2014 05:27 AM EST | Associated Press
LONDON (AP) — Barclays, Britain's second biggest bank by assets, set aside 500 million pounds ($805 million) to cover possible penalties amid international probes into the alleged rigging of foreign exchange markets.
The provision signals ongoing troubles for the bank, which is trying to overhaul its corporate culture after a string of scandals, including its involvement in the rigging of the LIBOR interest rate.
The bank said Thursday that adjusted pretax profit for the third quarter rose 15 percent to 1.59 billion pounds, beating analyst estimates.
CEO Antony Jenkins says the investment bank's performance was disappointing, but Barclays has "been able to offset that within the rebalanced group and still deliver good core performance."
Some analysts were nonetheless optimistic. Richard Hunter of Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers says Barclays' recovery is "starting to get traction."

Stocks mostly gain after Fed ends stimulus...and
versions
NEW YORK (AP) — Solid quarterly results from a range of big companies helped send the stock market slightly higher Thursday. The standout was Visa, whose 10 percent jump helped tug the Dow Jones industrial average up nearly 200 points.
Visa, the world's largest payment-processing company, turned in quarterly earnings late Wednesday that topped Wall Street's forecasts and announced plans to spend as much as $5 billion on buying its own shares. Visa's stock gained $21.99 to $236.65.
For investors, there was plenty of encouraging news. Before the market opened, the government said that the U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 3.5 percent in the three months ending in September, powered by more business investment, sales abroad and the biggest jump in military spending in five years.
"It's another report that indicates the economy can stand on its own two feet," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital Management, referring to the government's estimate of economic growth.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 12.35 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 1,994.65. The Nasdaq composite rose 16.91 points, or 0.4 percent, to 4,566.14.
The Dow Jones industrial average surged 221.11 points, or 1.3 percent, to 17,195.42. Unlike other market measures, the Dow weighs its roster of 30 large corporations by their stock prices rather than by their market size. That means companies with the most expensive stocks, such as Visa and Goldman Sachs, have more power to drive the average up or down.
The world's second-largest card-payment company, MasterCard, said its third-quarter profit surged as Americans appeared less hesitant to use their debit and credit cards. The results beat Wall Street's expectations, propelling MasterCard's stock up $7.14, or 9 percent, to $83.13.
Sam Stovall, chief equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ, saw a number of optimistic signs for the market. Reports that Visa and MasterCard are handling more transactions could mean that Americans will be more likely to open their wallets during the holiday shopping season. What's more, the market is approaching a stretch that nearly always rewards investors.
"We're entering the best six months of the year, November through April," Stovall said. Since World War II, the market has climbed 94 percent of the time, for an average gain of 15 percent.
Rising corporate earnings have helped turn the market higher in recent weeks. More than half of the S&P 500's members have released their third-quarter results, and roughly seven out of 10 have beaten Wall Street's targets, according to S&P Capital IQ. Third-quarter earnings are now on track to increase nearly 7 percent, with health-care companies reporting the largest profit gains.
BorgWarner, a maker of car parts, said a slide in the value of foreign currencies against the dollar will hamper its results this year. The company, which operates in 19 countries, cut its forecast for full-year profits and sales. BorgWarner slumped $2.49, or 4 percent, to $54.37.
In Europe, France's CAC 40 gained 0.7 percent and Germany's DAX edged up 0.4 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.1 percent.
Back in the U.S., the price of the 10-year Treasury note edged up, and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, slipped to 2.31 percent from 2.32 percent late Wednesday.
Gold lost $26.30 to settle at $1,198.60 an ounce, silver fell 84 cents to $16.42 an ounce and copper fell four cents to $3.06 a pound.
In other commodity trading, the price of oil fell as the dollar strengthened, making oil priced in dollars less attractive to overseas buyers. Benchmark U.S. crude fell $1.08 to close at $81.12 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many U.S. refineries, fell 88 cents to close at $86.24 on the ICE Futures exchange in London.
In other energy futures trading on the NYMEX:
— Wholesale gasoline fell 2.5 cents to close at $2.196 a gallon.
— Heating oil fell 2.2 cents to close at $2.513 a gallon.
— Natural gas rose 3.9 cents to close at $3.827 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Ukraine-Russia gas talks deadlocked in Brussels...and

BRUSSELS (AP) — Moscow and Kiev on Thursday clinched a multi-billion dollar deal that will guarantee that Russian gas exports flow into Ukraine and beyond to the European Union throughout the winter despite their intense rivalry over the fighting in eastern Ukraine.
EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, whose offices mediated the talks for months, said the EU will also help cash-strapped Ukraine with the payments through aid and guarantees.
"There is now no reason for people in Europe to stay cold this winter," he said.  Barroso added that he was "hopeful that the agreement can contribute to increase trust between Russia and Ukraine."
EU energy chief Guenther Oettinger said that "we can guarantee a security of supply over the winter," not only for Ukraine but also for the EU nations closest to the region that stood to suffer should the gas standoff have worsened.
A similar standoff in 2009 had caused serious disruptions in gas flowing from Russia into the EU and it was a prospect the bloc sought to avoid.
The agreement long hinged on the question whether Ukraine was in a position to come up with the necessary cash to pay for the gas. "Yes, they are," a confident Oettinger said. Oettinger said the $4.6 billion deal should extend through March.
"We can claim and pay for amounts that we need. That question has been totally settled," said Yuriy Prodan, Ukrainian Minister for Energy. "There will be no problems."
Under the deal, Ukraine would pay for its outstanding debt by making a $1.45 billion deposit without delay, and $1.65 billion by year's end. The final sum of debt would be determined through arbitration.
For new gas, Russia will only deliver after pre-payment and Ukraine intends to buy some $1.5 billion by the end of December.
The EU said in a statement it had been "working intensively" with international institutions and Ukraine to secure funds to pay for gas delivery in the coming winter.
"Unprecedented levels of EU aid will be disbursed in a timely manner," it said.
The deal only stretches through March and the difficulties of the talks were immediately evident when the Russians and Ukrainians started disagreeing on terms and prices of gas for next summer.
Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart, Petro Poroshenko, agreed earlier this month on the broad outline of a deal, but financial issues, centering on payment guarantees for Moscow, had long bogged down talks.
But with each week, the need for a resolution becomes more pressing, since winter is fast approaching in Ukraine, where temperatures often sink below freezing for days.
Russia cut off gas supplies to Ukraine in June after disputes over Russia's annexation of Crimea in March. Ukraine since then has been relying on gas transfers from other European countries and its own reserves.

Shell hurt by oil price drop  names new chairman...and
versions
AMSTERDAM (AP) — Shell, Europe's largest oil producer, reported a dip in third quarter profit on Thursday, but said it has yet to feel the full impact of the recent slide in oil prices.
As the company reported a 4.5 percent dip in third-quarter net profit, to $4.46 billion, Chief Financial Officer Simon Henry warned that the period's figures reflect only a third of the oil price's slide from above $100 per barrel this summer to around $81 per barrel.
Henry said that every $10 fall in the price of oil per barrel will shave $3 billion off Shell's annual earnings.
Shell's investment strategy is based on prices remaining between $70 and $110, Henry said, with $70 representing what Shell sees as a likely bottom for prices.
Explanations of the price fall have focused too much on supply issues, Henry said, notably booming production from U.S. shale fields.
"More important is demand," Henry said. "Demand is weaker in emerging markets, which account for all of the growth in demand" given that mature economies' oil use is expected to remain flat or decline.
When stripping out the impact of fluctuations in the price of oil, earnings rose 24 percent to $5.27 billion, Royal Dutch Shell PLC said. That measure of earnings, called "current cost of supplies", or CCS, is favored by the industry to gauge underlying profitability of operations. Shell said the performance reflects higher margins at both its production and refining operations.
Goldman Sachs analyst Michele della Vigna said the earnings were better than expected.
"Overall this is a good set of results, consistent with a reporting season for the European big oils (oil companies) that has mostly surprised to the upside," della Vigna said in a note to clients.
Shares fell 1.1 percent to 27. 94 euros ($35.18) in Amsterdam in a lower market.
Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said the company is trying to "keep a tight hold on costs and spending, and improve the balance between growth and returns."
Since becoming CEO this year, Van Beurden has slashed investment spending. Net capital investment in the quarter was $4.8 billion, compared with $9.4 billion a year ago.
Shell's production arm reported CCS profit excluding one-time charges of $4.34 billion, a 25 percent increase, which Shell said was due to high-margin oil projects coming on line. However, actual production fell by 5 percent to 2.79 million barrels per day, which Shell attributed in part to an expired license in Abu Dhabi and to capacity in Nigeria that has been temporarily shut due to safety concerns.
Henry forecast production will continue to decline in the short to medium term, due to asset sales.
The company said at its downstream arm, which includes refining, saw a doubling in CCS profit excluding charges to $1.79 billion on better margins.
Separately Thursday, the company named former DuPont Chief Executive Charles Holliday to become chairman of the board in 2015.
Holliday, who has written a book on sustainable business development, will replace outgoing chairman Jorma Ollila if approved at the shareholders' annual meeting next year.

Officials from L&T and Gujarat government exchange work order document for ``Statue of Unity" project in the presence of Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel in Gandhinagar on Monday
Gujarat awards Rs 2,979 cr work order for the project 
Gandhinagar, Oct 27:  
The Gujarat government on Monday issued work order for construction of the Statue of Unity – World’s tallest statue in the riverbed of Narmada near Kevadia in Gujarat to the engineering major Larsen & Toubro (L& T). The work order is worth Rs 2,979 crore.
Conceptualised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his tenure as Chief Minister of the state, the Statue of Unity project involves construction of 182-metre tall statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. The project was announced by Modi on October 31, 2013, the birth anniversary of the 'Iron Man of India’.
 
The work order was handed over by the state government officials to the L&T officials in the presence of Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel here on Monday.
Speaking on the occasion Patel stated that the project will play an important role in socio-economic development of the tribal region, where the project is being taken up.
 
“This will help boost eco-tourism and development for the local community. Such mammoth project will also generate local employment for the people in Kevadia,” Patel told media persons here.
 
Of the total contract of Rs 2,979 crore, Rs 1,347 crore will go towards building the statue, Rs 235 crore for constructing the exhibition centre and convention centre, Rs 134 crore for research and development centres and Rs 83 crore for building the bridge connecting memorial with the mainland. The construction will take place on the Sadhu bet – an island approximately 3.5 km south of Sardar Sarovar Dam at Kevadia.
 
As per the terms of agreement, L&T will be responsible for maintenance and management of the project site for 15 year after the completion of construction. L&T will be paid Rs 657 crore for the same. The construction of the statue is likely to be completed in the next 42 months.
 
In the first phase, construction of the main statue, the bridge connecting the statue with the river bank and reconstruction of the 12-kms road along the bank will be taken up.
 
The entire project involves the main statue, a memorial park at the base of the statue, an artificial reservoir between the Dam and Garudeshwar town, a visitor facilitation centre and a reception desk at Kevadia.
 
The total height of the statue from the base (or reduce level) will be 240 metres, which includes base level of 58 metres. The statue will be double the size of 'Statue of Liberty' in US and four times that of 'Christ the Redeemer' in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

LG Elec Q3 Profit More Than Doubles From Year Ago on Mobile
Reuters | Updated On: October 29, 2014 14:34 (IST)
Aviation Regulator Acts Tough Against Troubled SpiceJet: Report
Seoul: South Korea's LG Electronics Inc on Wednesday said its July-September operating profit more than doubled from a year earlier as earnings from its mobile business surged to a five-year high.
The world's No. 2 television maker after domestic rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd said profits for its TV business grew 5.2 per cent from a year earlier, while smartphone shipments rose to a fresh record.
"LG's earnings reflected strong performance from its mobile business," the company said in a statement.
LG reported an operating profit of 461 billion won ($440.21 million), better than a 454 billion won mean estimate from a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S poll of 36 analysts.
LG's mobile division turned a 167 billion won operating profit, its highest since the third quarter of 2009 and compared with a 79.7 billion won loss a year ago, thanks in part to strong shipments for the flagship G3 smartphone.
The pickup contrasts with domestic rival Samsung, which is expected to report its weakest quarterly operating profit in more than three years on Thursday, following a lacklustre run of new product launches.
While LG does not disclose individual product numbers, IM Investment analyst Kim Woon-ho estimated before the earnings disclosure that LG likely shipped a little over 3 million G3s during the period.
LG said it shipped 16.8 million smartphones during the third quarter, a record but well below Samsung, which some analysts estimate shipped more than 80 million units.
LG's TV division reported a 131 billion won operating profit, compared with 124 billion a year ago as sales of high-end products like ultra high-definition TVs grew. On Tuesday the company said it would wind down its plasma television business by end-November, signalling an imminent demise for a technology that has been overtaken by liquid crystal display.
Shares of LG Electronics extended gains following the results and were last up 4.2 per cent in afternoon trade compared with a 1.7 percent rise for the broader market.

Backed by RSS  Bengal & Kerala on BJP s radar | Know about BJP s  Chola  plan for TNBJP
(Choice of Chola not just…)
NEW DELHI: BJP and RSS are making yet another attempt to breach the as yet impregnable Dravidian fortress of Tamil Nadu politics by announcing a year-long celebration to mark the 1,000th anniversary of the accession to the throne of King Rajendra Chola.
At the recently concluded Akhil Bharatiya Karyakarini Mandal meet of the RSS, this decision slipped by unnoticed in the din of organisational changes announced at the meet.
Both the choice of icon and the fact that the RSS announced its programme at a time when AIADMK leader J Jayalalithaa is facing legal troubles is replete with meaning. "This is aimed at 2016 (when Tamil Nadu goes to polls), this is the chance to make headway in Tamil Nadu," said a senior RSS office bearer.
According to Tamilisai Soundararajan, president of BJP's state unit, the choice of Chola hinges not just on the fact that he was a conquering hero for Tamilians, having conquered much of Southeast Asia, but also "an attempt to get above the divisive politics, and talk of more religion-minded people".
"He is not just a Tamil king and the pride of the state, but to celebrate him is to go against the current trend of Dravidian politics, that only Dravidian-minded people be celebrated, and others, especially if they are religious-minded, are pushed to the background or are called anti-secular," she said.
Her reference is to the fact that as emperor, Rajendra Chola had endowed many Shaiviite mutts in Tamil Nadu. "He supported Brahmdeya land grants, endowed many Shaiviite mutts and was an expansionist king," says M SS Pandian, professor at JNU.
While Pandian acknowledges that the choice of Rajendra Chola makes "sense" for the BJP. "He was an expansionist king extending the borders of his kingdom beyond India into Southeast Asia and he was a king who did endow religious orders," he said. "But it won't be easy for the BJP even with Jayalalithaa's present troubles. In the past too, the Sangh Parivar has tried to appropriate the text Tirupural, which was celebrated by the Dravidian movement, Tamil Bhakti saints were also promoted by them," he said.
With a new BJP chief, who is an OBC, he adds, the effort is very visible but may take more time. The Sangh Parivar has time till 2016, and they hope a dead king may help them crack the one political puzzle that has baffled them till now.

(As the technology giant…)
MUMBAI: Mid-size software services firm Mphasis Ltd continued its trend of posting successive declines in revenue, as it continues to face headwinds from the weakness of its parent company HP and its US mortgage market dependent-digital risk segment.
Hewlett Packard owns a little over 60% of Mphasis and contributes about 36% to its revenues. But as the technology giant has struggled to win deals globally, the amount of work flowing through to its Indian unit has also dropped.
Analysts have pointed out that revenue from the HP-channel has dropped about 53% over the last three years and that the decline is likely to continue.
Mphasis said its consolidated net revenues dropped 1.7% sequentially to Rs 1,465 crore in the second quarter, while net profit dropped 8.4% sequentially to Rs 160.2 crore. The company's net margin contracted to 10.9% in the quarter.
HP channel revenues fell 3.1%, while direct revenues fell 2.1%, due to weakness in the emerging markets.
However, the company said it won $65 million worth of deals in the second quarter.
"We continue to see good traction in our direct organic business. Our focus on GRC, Digital and AMS is paying off" said Ganesh Ayyar, Chief Executive Officer- Mphasis, said in a statement. Direct selling revenue from mature markets increased 2.5%.
Mphasis has also received assessment notices for the tax years from 2003 to 2010 due to transfer pricing issues. The company said it has filed appeals against the notices.
"Currently, they have a lot of problems but the deal wins are encouraging. They need more consistent and bigger wins to offset the impact of HP and the direct risk business. The uncertainty over the potential HP sale is also hurting," an analyst with an Indian-brokerage, who declined to be identified, told ET.
Mphasis is often pointed to as the next buy-out target in the IT industry, as HP struggles with its businesses.

Realty stocks to do well  choice limited: EdelweissEdelweiss Financial Services
(Wherever there are good…)
In a chat with ET Now, Vikas Khemani of Edelweiss Financial Services , shares his thoughts on the realty sector. Excerpts:
ET Now: One has really seen the move come in on realty of late. It could just be a trading play, but what is the sense that you are getting? Could these sectors now, which have been so bogged down with a lot of negative news, become investment bets?
Vikas Khemani: Realty, as a sector, looks very interesting, with it being interest rate sensitive, very much leveraged to the economic growth, employment creation, etc.
But unfortunately, you could not have many large players in this sector without any issues. If you look at some of the large players, they have had many issues recently. That is why investors are a bit hesitant to commit large amount of money in this. Wherever there are good quality stocks and good quality companies, they are very small where investors cannot come in.
But if you ask me if realty companies will do well, then the answer is yes. But currently, the choice of stocks to play for investors is very very limited and that problem continues to remain.

QE ends: It doubled investor money @ Wall StreetDid the Federal Reserve's $4 trillion experiment work?
AP Oct 30, 2014, 11.08AM IST

(Launched during the financial…)
NEW YORK: The $4 trillion experiment is over.
The Federal Reserve announced the end of its economic stimulus known as quantitative easing on Wednesday. Launched during the financial crisis in 2008, it was an unprecedented effort aimed at reviving a dormant economy through buying trillions in bonds. It also provoked a political backlash.
Q: Did the stimulus work?
A: It depends on who you ask. But many economists say the Fed accomplished the bulk of its goals. In the beginning, the Fed just wanted to stop the financial crisis from getting worse. It's impossible to know what would have happened without the Fed's help. But buying mortgage bonds, which many considered toxic at the time, arguably prevented more banks from failing and breathed life into frozen lending markets. The first round of quantitative easing was a rescue program. The second round, called QE2, was met with heated criticism.
Q: Why did people have such strong opinions about it?
A: Politicians, investors and even well-respected economists said pumping all that money into the banking system would cause the dollar to plummet and result in rampant inflation. They also feared bubbles in financial markets that would soon pop.
Q: What happened?
A: Since August 2010, when Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke argued for a second round of stimulus, the dollar has gained strength against major currencies and inflation has stayed tame. One widely used measure, the dollar index, has bounced around over recent years, but is currently 3 per cent higher. Over the past year, overall prices have climbed a modest 1.7 per cent .
Q: What has happened to the stock market since then?
A: If you made a bet on the stock market when Bernanke made his speech in the summer of 2010, your investment doubled. The most widely used benchmark for investment funds, the Standard & Poor's 500 index, has returned 101 per cent since then, powered by a stronger economy, higher spending and record corporate profits.
Q: So now the Fed owns $4 trillion in bonds. Does it have to sell them?
A: No, they can sit on them. Some analysts wonder how the Fed will be able to unload its massive collection of bonds without disrupting markets. Very, very slowly, is the Fed's answer, and only if needed. One way is to stop re-investing money from bonds when they mature.
Q: What will the end of QE mean for markets?
A: Many investors expect more turbulence over the short term. In the bond market, the Fed's efforts have helped keep prices high and yields low. But there are plenty of other reasons besides the central bank's actions. Low long-term interest rates reflect sluggish economic growth, so slowdowns across the industrialized world mean government borrowing rates in Japan and Germany are even lower than U.S rates. As a result, foreign banks and investors keep buying US bonds - which has tugged rates lower and kept the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note well below 3 per cent for most of the year - the opposite of what market strategists expected.
Q: What about the stock market?
A: The big question for stock investors is: When will the Fed start hiking its benchmark lending rate? The move is expected to come at some point next year. Investors say more sharp swings in stocks are likely as that day draws closer. But there's general agreement on Wall Street that the central bank will increase rates slowly enough that it won't derail the US economic recovery.

(Appreciating Bera, Clinton…)
WASHINGTON: Congressman Ami Bera's re-election bid has got a major boost with former US President Bill Clinton campaigning for him in the California seat where the Indian-American is locked in a tight contest.
With Clinton, the star campaigner for the Democratic Party , personally seeking votes for Bera-the only Indian-American in the current Congress and only the third ever Indian-American to be elected to the US House of Representatives-his electoral chances brightened yesterday.
Clinton described Bera as the embodiment of the American Dream.
49-year-old Bera is facing a tough competition from Republican Doug Ose, a businessman who served three terms in Congress through 2005.
Appreciating Bera, Clinton described him as a "local remedy" for the intransigence gripping Washington.
He cited Bera's support for the federal health care overhaul, equal pay for women and increasing the minimum wage.
Clinton alleged that Republicans are too often trapped in an "evidence-free zone," mentioning their denial of global climate change and disapproval of raising the minimum wage.
In his brief opening remarks, Bera supported the candidature of Hillary Clinton for the 2016 presidential polls.
Speaking about his high school senior daughter, he said: "When she votes in her first election in 2016, I want her vote to help us elect the first female president of the United States of America. I am ready for that."
"But first, let's focus on an election we have six days from now," he added.
In his campaign, Ose described Clinton's campaigning for Bera as an act of desperation.
"Today, in a sign of desperation to save his failing campaign, Congressman Ami Bera will stand on stage at a rally with former President Bill Clinton," said Michawn Rich, Doug Ose's spokeswoman.
She said that Bera's campaign is "on life support." "Today's rally proves he is willing to do whatever it takes to cover up his record of having delivered absolutely nothing for California's 7th Congressional District," she alleged.
Rich further alleged that Bera has relied on Washington, DC to fund his campaign of lies and now he is bringing DC home with him.
"This is his last-ditch attempt to trick voters by hiding the fact that he works for Washington, not Sacramento County - and he's pulling out all the stops," she said.
The Bera-Ose electoral duel is said to be the most expensive Congressional contest this election, with outside groups pouring in more than USD 11 million into the campaign.

DLF asked to give fund-requirement plans for...DLF
(While challenging the Sebi order…)
MUMBAI: As it fights a Sebi ban on accessing capital markets, realty giant DLF was asked today to provide details of funds it immediately needs to get an interim relief to redeem capital locked in mutual funds.
While challenging the Sebi order barring it and six others, including top executives, from capital markets for three years, DLF had sought this interim relief on October 22, after which the capital markets regulator was asked to give a reply.
The regulator today submitted before SAT that the company can be given an interim relief, provided it gives a detailed proposal for requirement of funds it needs to redeem, by December 31.
DLF was asked to file an affidavit in this matter by Monday, after which SAT would issue directions on Wednesday (November 5) on whether the interim relief can be given.
Subsequently, DLF has also been asked to submit its reply by December 8 to submissions made by the regulator with regard to the notice issued to it on the main appeal against the Sebi order. After receiving DLF's reply, SAT would begin final hearing in the case on December 10.
Sebi has barred DLF and others for "active and deliberate suppression" of material information at the time of its IPO over seven years ago.
During the first hearing on October 22, Sebi had faced the flak for delay in passing the order and also for the adverse impact suffered by shareholders, who lost over Rs 7,500 crore of their wealth in a single day post the order.
While promoters own 74.93 per cent stake in DLF, foreign institutional investors have close to 20 per cent and retail shareholders have about 4 per cent, among others.
This was one of the rare orders by Sebi where it barred a blue-chip firm and its top promoter/executives from market.
DLF's initial public offer in 2007 had fetched Rs 9,187 crore - the biggest IPO in the country at that time.
The case has also brought to limelight 'technicalities' involved in the practice of Sebi giving 'observations' and not 'approval or clearance' for an IPO.
There is a view that regulators need to understand that the business practices tend to be different in real estate sector, from manufacturing or other segments of the economy.
However, others feel that regulations cannot be overlooked to accommodate certain 'prevailing practices' in one particular sector, such as those related to use of 'friendly' entities for purchase of land or development rights in the name of ease of doing business.

P-Note investments climb to 3-month high at $36 bn in SeptP-Note investments climb to 3-month high at $36 bn in Sept
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Oct 30:  
Investments into domestic shares through participatory notes (P-Notes) hit a three-month high of Rs 2.22 lakh crore (about $36 billion) in September.
P-Notes are mostly used by overseas HNIs (High Networth Individuals), hedge funds and other foreign institutions, to invest in Indian markets through registered foreign institutional investors (FIIs), while saving on time and costs associated with direct registration.
According to the data released by Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the total value of P-Note investments in Indian markets (equity, debt and derivatives) increased from Rs 2,11,499 crore in August to Rs 2,22,394 crore at the end of September.
This is the highest level since June, when the cumulative value of such investments stood at Rs 2,24,248 crore.
Investment through P-Notes grew in September after declining for two successive months.
Besides, the value of P-Notes issued with derivatives as underlying, stood at Rs 1,02,224 crore at the end of last month.
The quantum of FII investments through P-Notes climbed to 10.7 per cent last month from 10.3 per cent in August.
Till a few years ago, P-Notes used to account for more than 50 per cent of the total FII investments, but their share has fallen after SEBI tightened the disclosure norms and other regulations for such investments.
P-Notes have been accounting for mostly 15-20 per cent of total FII holdings in India since 2009, while it used to be much higher — in the range of 25—40 per cent — in 2008. It was as high as over 50 per cent at the peak of Indian stock market bull run during a few months in 2007.
FIIs, the key drivers of Indian markets, pumped in a net amount of more than Rs 5,100 crore (USD 845 million) in the domestic equity market last month, while they poured in nearly Rs 16,000 crore (USD 2.6 billion) in the debt market in September.

(Net profit rose 15 per cent…)
MUMBAI: ICICI Bank , the country's largest private sector lender by assets, said September quarter earnings rose 15% aided by a surge in treasury income, even as profits from lending companies fell due to a surge in bad loans. The bank is cautious on lending to companies as the demand for loans from new projects remains sluggish despite an improvement in sentiment after the NDA government came to power in May.
Net profit for the lender's fiscal second quarter rose to Rs 2,709 crore, from Rs 2,352 crore a year earlier. That was higher than analysts' estimate of Rs 2,686 crore compiled by Bloomberg. Shares rose 0.5% to Rs 1,161.50.
"We are calibrating our approach to corporates, given the economic environment," said Chanda Kochhar, managing director and chief executive officer of ICICI Bank. "There is a lag between economic recovery and growth in corporate activity. Any pick-up in economic activity would first trigger demand for working capital loans. We have seen no demand for credit for green field projects," she added.
Although investor sentiment has driven stocks to record highs after Narendra Modi was elected prime minister, due to optimism about economic reforms, the reality on the ground is yet to change. Debt-laden companies are not yet committing to new projects, but are lowering their debt burden."The bottom line is in line with expectations," said Vaibhav Agarwal banking analyst at Angel Broking. "The asset quality figures are disappointing."
Net non-performing loans at 1.09% of net advances were up marginally from 0.99% in the June quarter. Provisions for bad loans rose 36% to Rs 850 crore in the September quarter, fromRs 625 crore a year ago. Provisions for unhedged forex exposures stood at Rs 30 crore.
Although there was a jump in bad loans and provisions, the management assured that it might be one-off and not necessarily a trend that would continue into future. "Given the challenging environment, there have been additions to non-performing assets," said Kochhar.
"There have been slippages in the restructured book. Net additions to restructurings, and slippages would be lower in coming quarters." The restructured loan pipeline is around Rs 1,800 crore. The net interest income — the difference between interest earned on loans and interest paid for funds — increased 15% to Rs 4,657 crore fromRs 4,044 crore last year.
Net interest margin (NIM), a measure of profitability rose to 3.4%, from 3.3% in the previous year. Other income from fees, commissions and revenue advisory and services climbed nearly 26% to Rs 2,738 crore. The bank restructured loans worth Rs 900 crore in the September quarter, taking net loans to companies whose funding have been restructured to Rs 11,020 crore at September quarter, up from Rs 6,826 crore a year ago.

Giving a thumbs up to the reform measures announced by the Narendra Modi government, Moody's Investor Service, has said the policy changes will help enhance India's credit profile and achieve a higher GDP or gross domestic product growth.

The report stated lower fiscal deficits, inflation rates and a strengthened banking sector will allow higher growth levels to be sustained at around 7.5 per cent over the next 5-10 years.
The government is hoping to trim its fiscal deficit and announced a range of expenditure rationalisation measures

Tata group invests in Swiss solar company FlisomTata group invests in Swiss solar company Flisom

Zurich, Oct 30:  
Tata group has invested in a Swiss start-up solar company as several companies from the European country vie for a share in the Indian solar energy market which is seen as having a huge potential due to its growing energy needs.
“Tata is an investor in Flisom and has a significant investment in the company,” Chief Operating Officer of Flisom Sudheer Kumar said speaking at the company’s research office in Dubendorf here.
Asked about the Tata share of investment in the Swiss start up that deals with Solar energy generation equipment, Chief Executive Officer of Flisom Ulfert Ruhle merely said there were no majority stakeholders in the company.
“We have several investors and no one is a majority stakeholder but we can tell you that Tata is among the top investor,” Ruhle added.
Ruhle and Kumar are of the view that India has a huge potential for exploiting the solar energy to meet its future energy requirements.
The energy requirements are growing in India and they have to look for sources of new and renewable energy, they said adding a country like India can generate significant electricity from Sun light.
Kumar said the copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) solar cells developed by his company were suited for a country like India.
“We have developed these cells on a thin film which can be folded and stored inside the house at night.
While the cost of manufacturing and installation is lower than other solar cells, the efficiency is good and processing takes place at high speed,” he added.
Meyer Burger, another company dealing with Photovoltaic materials which is setting up two Solar power plants in Gujarat and Kerala, is also hoping to do more business with Indian companies and is ready to pass on the technology as well.

Mumbai: Private sector Yes Bank Ltd on Thursday said net profit rose 30% to Rs.483 crore in the September quarter from Rs.371 crore in the year-ago quarter.
Net profit was higher than the Rs.457 crore forecast by 33 analysts polled by Bloomberg.
Profit increased mainly because of higher net interest income and a drop in provisions for bad loans compared with last year.
Net interest income (NII), or the core income a bank earns by giving loans, increased 27% to Rs.856 crore from Rs.672 crore last year.
Provisions for bad loans dropped 33% to Rs.120 crore in the quarter ended September from Rs.179 crore a year ago. Net non-performing assets (NPAs) increased slightly to 0.09% from 0.04% in the same quarter last year.
Higher net interest margin (NIM) also helped the bank improve profitability. NIM, or the difference between interest expended and that earned on loans, improved to 3.2% from 2.9% in the corresponding quarter last year.
Yes Bank shares were trading up 2.1% at Rs.652 apiece at 12pm, while the 30-share benchmark Sensex was trading at 27,259, up 0.6%.

Woman Hanged In Iran Sent Family Chilling Messagereddit
An Iranian woman who was executed on Saturday despite international pleas for clemency left her family a heartbreaking message several months before her death.
Reyhaneh Jabbari, 26, was hanged on Saturday morning in Tehran's Evin prison after spending  five years on death row for the 2007 murder of a man she said had tried to rape her.
Jabbari confessed to stabbing Morteza Abdolali Sarbandi in the back in the apartment where he allegedly tried to sexually abuse her. She claimed that another man in the apartment was the one who killed Sarbandi, though she refused to identify him. According to Amnesty International , Jabbari's claims were never properly investigated.
Several international organizations, including Amnesty International , the U.N. and the European Union , pleaded for the woman's release, arguing that she acted in self-defense and that her confession was obtained under pressure. Sarbandi's family, however, insisted the murder was premeditated and refused to grant her a reprieve.
In the gut-wrenching message, which dates back to April, Jabbari decries her fate, expressing anger and disappointment with the inspectors and judges who handled her case. She references the pressure she was under during the interrogations and the abuse she faced while in prison.
The message was translated by Iranian activists into English and published on the website of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, a coalition of Iranian opposition activists in exile.
Jabbari says:
The world allowed me to live for 19 years. That ominous night it was I that should have been killed. My body would have been thrown in some corner of the city, and after a few days, the police would have taken you to the coroner’s office to identify my body and there you would also learn that I had been raped as well. The murderer would have never been found since we don’t have their wealth and their power. Then you would have continued your life suffering and ashamed, and a few years later you would have died of this suffering and that would have been that.
However, with that cursed blow the story changed. My body was not thrown aside, but into the grave of Evin Prison and its solitary wards, and now the grave-like prison of Shahr-e Ray. But give in to the fate and don’t complain. You know better that death is not the end of life.
She continues by begging her mother to give up her organs for donation.
My kind mother, dear Sholeh, the one more dear to me than my life, I don’t want to rot under the soil. I don’t want my eye or my young heart to turn into dust. Beg so that it is arranged that as soon as I am hanged my heart, kidney, eye, bones and anything that can be transplanted be taken away from my body and given to someone who needs them as a gift. I don’t want the recipient know my name, buy me a bouquet, or even pray for me. I am telling you from the bottom of my heart that I don’t want to have a grave for you to come and mourn there and suffer. I don’t want you to wear black clothing for me. Do your best to forget my difficult days. Give me to the wind to take away.
According to UN human rights experts, Iran executed 625 people in 2013, including at least 28 women.

Acer Aspire E15 review: A better bet for student than buying a tabletPrint
If you are looking for a very affordable, full function laptop then the Acer Aspire E15 is definitely a good option.
Written by Nandagopal Rajan | New Delhi | Posted: October 28, 2014 3:23 pm | Updated: October 28, 2014 3:48 pm
We don’t talk much about laptops these days. All the conversation about computing seems to be centred around smartphones and tablets. But there are still lots of people who are picking up their first laptops, especially in a country like India. College students for instance need a proper computer with a keyboard and an optical disc drive to do much of their work. The tablet falls short of much of their needs. But is it possible to buy a good functional laptop for the price of a tablet? I think I’ve found the answer in the new Acer Aspire E15.
Specs: Windows 8.1 OS | 15.6-inch 1366x768p HD LED True Cinematic display | Intel Celeron N2830  Dual-core 2.16 GHz | 2GB DDR3L SDRAM | 500GB Storage | DVD writer | HDMI | USB 2.0 x 2; USB 3.0 x 1 | Card reader | 2.4 kg
Price: Rs 20,999
Design: The E15 is a large laptop with a 15.6-inch screen, the type that has started becoming rare these days. But this means the laptop is ideal for those who need a lot of real estate to work on — for instance, those working on design needs and research. However, despite the size, the E15 is far from bulky. Yes, it is heavy at 2.4 kg, but it is relatively slim with a maximum height of 27.15 mm.
The review unit I got was all-black with a matte finished body. The wrist rest and he rear of the clamshell had a perforated texture. The trackpad is at the same level as the keys, while the keyboard itself was housed a level below. There is just one power button outside the keyboard, and this makes the design uncomplicated and simple.
The full size finetip keyboard is good to work on with just the right amount of travel on the keys. However, I found the edges of the laptop to be a bit too sharp and my wrists felt strained after I had written a 500-word piece using the E15. You might need to pad up this sharp edge if you want to use the computer for long hours.
The ports are all in the rear, just under the screen. The lower half of the clamshell rises up towards the screen to accommodate all the HDMI, LAN and two USB ports. Even power point is at the rear.
Display: The HD display is good for all types of uses and does not have much glare. No, it is not a touchscreen and there is no FullHD, but then this is a budget laptop.
Performance: The E15, for obvious reasons, is not powered by a Intel Core i3 or i5 processor. What it has is the Bay Trail based Intel Celeron N2830 processor, which has better power efficiency that third gen Core i3 processors, but might be a bit lacking when it comes to processing and overall features. However, for the price point this offers a good value proposition. It is not as sprightly as the latest Core i3 processors and will groan a bit if pushed to the limit as I discovered by browsing the web using the Chrome and over a dozen tabs running. But I was pleased to the see the laptop remain cool even under pressure. This one won’t trouble you much if you are doing regular stuff, but it is not built for anything more tiresome. The E15 starts up really quickly and wakes up from sleep in under 10 seconds.
Verdict: If you are looking for a very affordable, full function laptop then the Acer Aspire E15 is definitely a good option. I would recommend this for high school and college students, but not for those who are looking for a business laptop. But yes this costs just as much, or even lower that a lot of tablets and if you are looking to be productive then the E15 might prove to be the better bet.

Gold, silver recover on buying at lower levels
PTI
gold and precious material
Snapping its three-day losing streak, gold prices recovered by Rs. 40 to Rs. 27,490 per 10 grams in the national capital on Tuesday on emergence of buying by jewellers and retailers at existing lower levels amid a firm global trend.
Silver followed suit and gained Rs. 50 to Rs. 38,250 per kg on increased off-take by industrial units.
Traders said emergence of buying at prevailing lower levels by jewellers and retailers mainly supported the upside in prices of precious metals. Besides, a firming global trend where gold recovered from a two-week low as investors weighed increased physical demand ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve policy meet at which they are expected to end a bond-buying programme, boosted the sentiment, they said.
Gold in Singapore, which normally determines price trend on the domestic front, rose by 0.5 per cent to $1,232.40 an ounce and silver by 0.4 per cent to $17.21 an ounce. In Delhi, gold of 99.9 and 99.5 per cent purity went up by Rs. 40 each to Rs. 27,490 and Rs. 27,290 per 10 grams, respectively, while sovereign held steady at Rs. 24,200 per piece of eight grams. It had lost Rs. 475 in the past three sessions.
Silver ready rose by Rs. 50 to Rs. 38,250 per kg and weekly-based delivery by Rs. 170 to Rs. 38,190 per kg.
Silver coins, however, held steady at Rs. 66,000 for buying and Rs. 67,000 for selling of 100 pieces.

Subsidised LPG Cylinder Prices Up After Hike in Dealer CommissionYou are here: Home Economy
Subsidised LPG Cylinders To Cost More
Press Trust of India | Updated On: October 29, 2014 17:14 (IST)
Iron Ore Imports Surge as Prices Fall
New Delhi: Subsidised cooking gas (LPG) rates have been hiked by Rs 3 per cylinder after the government raised the commission paid to dealers. The commission paid to dealers was last week hiked by Rs 3 per 14.2-kg cylinder to Rs 43.71.
Dealers' commission was last revised in December 2013 when it was hiked by Rs 3.46 per cylinder to Rs 40.71. The increase in commission - which as per practice is passed on to consumers - came into effect from October 23. Subsidised LPG in Delhi now costs Rs 417 per 14.2-kg cylinder as against Rs 414 previously.
In Mumbai, subsidised LPG will cost Rs 452 per 14.2-kg cylinder as against Rs 448.50 previously.
The hike in dealers' commission has also resulted in the rate of non-subsidised LPG, which a consumer buys after consuming his quota of 12 cylinders at below-market rates, being hiked to Rs 883.50 per 14.2-kg bottle from Rs 880 previously.

Sugar Mills to Start Operations on Time Next Month: Food SecretaryIndian Realty Market Sees $4.5 Billion Investment During January-September: CBRE
New Delhi: Sugar mills in India's main cane-producing state are likely to start crushing on time next month, even though a dispute over cane prices is unresolved, and the world's biggest consumer is poised to produce a surplus for the fifth straight year.
A timely start to the crushing season could depress local prices by increasing supplies and may force mills to seal export deals at lower price.
Mills in the biggest cane-producing state of Uttar Pradesh had threatened to suspend operations, citing their inability to pay state-government-mandated cane prices to farmers.
"The cane commissioner of UP (Uttar Pradesh) has told us that the mills have assured the state government that they will start their operations on time," Food Secretary Sudhir Kumar said after a meeting of officials from sugar-producing states.
Industry officials now believe the state government of Uttar Pradesh may raise the 2014-15 cane price only marginally. It is likely to announce the cane price after November 10.
The state government had told mills to pay Rs 280 ($4.57) per 100 kg for cane in the 2013-14 marketing year that ended in September, compared with the Rs 210 recommended by the central government.
Mills paid that but, anticipating yet another price rise in the current year, made the threat to halt operations.
The state-mandated cane price has climbed 65 per cent in five years, while sugar prices have fallen by 2 per cent.
State-run banks have declined to offer fresh working capital to mills as some have defaulted on bank loans due to low sugar prices.
Supply glut
The country's sugar output is expected to rise 4 per cent to 25.5 million tonnes in the 2014-15 season that started on October 1, higher than local consumption of around 23 million tonnes, a government official said, declining to be identified because he is not authorised to speak to media.
In the new season, Maharashtra is likely to produce 9.1 million tonnes of sugar, while Uttar Pradesh could churn out 6.2 million tonnes, the official said.
The surplus production could force the government to give incentives for exports as prices are not attractive in the world market, a Mumbai-based dealer said.
Although a delay in announcing incentives for the 2014-15 season had led to doubts about the intentions of the new administration, two government sources told Reuters this week that it would consider the matter after the output forecast was released.
In February, the government gave a subsidy of Rs 3,300 ($53.82) a tonne for production and exports of up to 4 million tonnes of raw sugar to help mills cut their large stockpiles.

New Delhi: The government has raised the price it will pay to buy new-season wheat from local farmers to Rs 1,450 per 100 kg, up 3.57 per cent, increasing the incentive to plant the crop even though supply has exceeded demand for eight years.
India, also the world's second-biggest wheat consumer, sets a price each year at which it buys grains from domestic farmers to sell ultra-cheap food to the poor, to protect growers from distress sale and to cover emergency needs.

India Can Grow at 8-9%  Good Governance Key: Finance MinisterIron Ore Imports Surge as Prices Fall
New Delhi: The Indian economy has the capacity to grow at 8-9 per cent and good governance would make economic expansion "more exuberant", Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Wednesday.
"I have always wondered to myself that in the last two years with average to moderate governance (economic growth was sub-five per cent)."
"India has a capacity to grow by 8-9 per cent. If we had followed the best practices and displayed the highest standards of good governance, probably our (levels) of growth would have been more exuberant," he said in his valedictory address at the CAG conference.
Amid slowing down investments and allegations of corruption in allocation of natural resources, India's economic growth had slumped to below 5 per cent in 2012-13 and 2013-14. The economy, however, showed signs of rival as the GDP clocked a 5.7 per cent growth in the April-June period of the current fiscal year - the highest in the past 10 quarters.
The BJP led-NDA government, which assumed power in May, had fought the election on the promise of providing good governance to the country.
A recent World Bank report projects India's economy to expand by 5.6 per cent this fiscal year as reforms gain momentum and the growth is expected to accelerate as proposed measures such as Goods and Services Tax provide a boost to manufacturing sector.
Highlighting the importance of audit, Mr Jaitley said accountability and transparency are essential as it helps in good governance.
"...(if) uncomfortable questions at times were not asked, governance would tend to become despotic and therefore in any system of governance there has to be various laws of accountability and this is in itself an unquestionable proposition," he added.

Aviation Regulator Acts Tough Against Troubled SpiceJet: Report
New Delhi: Sesa Sterlite on Wednesday reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 1,619 crore for July-September 2014 on the back of Rs 19,448.14 crore net sales.
The metal, mining and oil and gas major had reported Rs 2,394 crore net profit after tax, minority interest and consolidated share in profit of associates in the same quarter last fiscal year while net sales were at Rs 25,170.66 crore, it said in a filing to the BSE.
The NRI billionaire Anil Agarwal-led firm, however, said the results are not comparable as Sesa Sterlite was created in August last year following a merger of Sterlite Industries and several other entities of Vedanta group into Sesa Goa last year in August.
"Main performance drivers during the quarter were copper, aluminium and zinc India businesses; while oil & gas production in Rajasthan has normalised after completion of maintenance shutdown at the Mangala processing terminal," said Group CEO Tom Albanese in a statement.
Revenues of the company were mainly driven by improved volumes at its Indian copper business. Higher prices of aluminium and zinc helped as also its iron ore business due to better pig iron output and sale.
Revenue from Cairn India, however, dipped due to lower volumes resulting from a planned shutdown.
"Margins were lower due to oil and gas given the weaker crude oil prices. Better price in Zinc and Aluminium were offset by higher cost due to lower volumes and higher input costs in aluminium," Sesa Sterlite said.
The company reduced its gross debt by around Rs 500 crore at Rs 79,526 crore as of September 30. It has Rs 47,107 crore cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments. The company's board has recommended an interim dividend of Rs 1.75 per share.
Mr Albanese said second half of the current fiscal year would be better for the company as zinc production will be better than first half. There would be higher value of production from Cairn India following scheduled maintenance shutdowns. Same is the case with Indian copper business.
"So they will have higher value of production in second half, that will benefit in in the second half. In second half, iron ore operations should resume in Goa," he added.
Meanwhile, Sesa Sterlite informed BSE that its board of directors has approved an interim dividend of Rs 1.75 (i.e. 175 per cent) per equity share on face value of Rs 1 each.
Shares in Sesa Sterlite jumped 2.12 per cent to end the day at Rs 255.55 apiece on the BSE.

No Need to Panic at Oil Price Drop: OPECIndian Realty Market Sees $4.5 Billion Investment During January-September: CBRE
There is no need to panic at the recent drop in oil prices, the secretary general of OPEC said on Wednesday, saying low prices would curb competing supplies and require the group to pump far more by the end of the decade.
Abdullah al-Badri said output of higher-cost oil supplies such as shale would be curbed if oil remained at around $85 a barrel, while the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries enjoys lower costs and will see higher demand for its crude in the longer term.
The comments are a further indication that OPEC, which meets in November to set output policy, has no plan to cut supply in a bid to push prices back up. OPEC members have previously said they wanted oil at around $100 a barrel.
"If prices stay at $85, we will see a lot of investment, a lot of oil, going out of the market," Badri said in London at the Oil & Money conference, an annual industry event. "About 65 percent of the producers, they have high costs. Not OPEC."
Brent crude has dropped more than a quarter from above $115 per barrel in June as abundant supplies of high-quality oil such as U.S. shale have overwhelmed demand in many markets, filling stocks worldwide.
Badri did not say whether OPEC needed to cut oil production at its Nov. 27 meeting in Vienna to support the market, and appealed for calm over the decline in prices.
"We do not see much change in the fundamentals. Demand is still growing, supply is also growing. OPEC is reviewing the situation," he said.
"The most important thing is we should not panic," he said. "Unfortunately, everybody is panicking. We really need to sit, and think and see how this will develop."
PRICE FLOOR
Badri declined to specify a level at which oil prices might find a floor, saying OPEC did not have a price target but would instead leave that to the market.
"OPEC's average price will still be $100 at the end of this year so we are fine for 2014," he said. "The fundamentals do not reflect this low price."
"OPEC does not have a price target. We must let the market settle down."
Brent was trading around $87 by 1220 GMT after reaching a four-year low of $82.60 two weeks ago.
Badri said last month that he expected OPEC to lower its oil output target when it meets in Vienna, which would be its first formal output cut since the 2008 financial crisis.
OPEC has a production target of 30 million barrels per day (bpd) and Badri suggested last month that this should be cut to around 29.5 million bpd.
Since then, key OPEC members Iran and Kuwait have said a cut in output at the meeting was unlikely. Top producer Saudi Arabia has yet to comment publicly.
Badri reiterated that supplies from rival producers, such as shale oil, were not a threat to OPEC long-term and said OPEC had to be ready to pump far more in future.
"In the longer term, OPEC must be ready to produce. Around 2018-2020, U.S. tight oil will slow down," he said. "By 2020, OPEC must be ready to produce 40 million bpd of oil, and 50 million bpd of liquids, that's crude and natural gas liquids."

Can India become a manufacturing powerhouseStory
A Formidable Task
Goutam Das      Follow @Goutam20    Edition: Nov 9, 2014
In the right direction: A production line at Maruti's Manesar factory.
Six months is a long time. It is nearly the time a trip to Mars would take, according to Mars One, a not-for-profit foundation that seeks to establish a permanent human settlement on the planet whose average distance from the Earth is 225 million km. It is also the time a 1,622-km-long road journey in India could take.
Two years ago, heavy engineering company ISGEC was transporting three consignments of column - process equipment weighing between 53 metric tonnes and 158 metric tonnes, and six meters high - from its factory in Gujarat's Dahej to the Jindal Steel & Power plant in Angul, Odisha. Along the way, the company faced three railway shutdowns, made five detours where roads were being built, trimmed 100 trees after local permissions because of the column's height, and removed and reinstated 200 overhead power cables. It also paid off villagers a dozen times to allow the consignment to pass, and its drivers and supervisors were manhandled 13 times. The road barely existed in the last 100 km. The equipment was delivered in 180 days.
This journey tells the tale of making in India - manufacturers everyday face headwinds due to poor infrastructure, lack of environment clearances, local trouble, and slow decision making. Add labour trouble, land issues and taxation bottlenecks and you have a sector that is deep in the woods.

Growth in the market capitalisation of BT 500 companies has fluctuated over the past five years. From 52.16 per cent in 2010, growth slumped to 13.66 per cent in 2011 and 5.20 per cent in 2012. It recovered to 13.14 per cent in 2013 and to 32.28 per cent this year. Also, the number of manufacturing companies in the BT 500 list shrank from 236 in 2009 to 202 in 2013, before recovering to 215 in 2014.

This is not all. Manufacturing's share in the country's gross domestic product has fallen in recent years, from a high of 16.28 per cent in 2011/12 to 14.94 per cent in 2013/14. And latest data continues to indicate a slowdown - manufacturing output fell 1.4 per cent in August from a year earlier because of a lack of new orders. In a quarterly survey in August, industry lobby FICCI said 71 per cent manufacturing units didn't have plans for capacity addition for next six months with capacity utilisation remaining stagnant thus far. More than 64 per cent said they may not hire additional workforce in next three months, according to the survey.

It is in this context that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's high decibel 'Make In India' campaign is so refreshing to many industrialists. On September 25, he unveiled the campaign's logo - a striding lion made of cog-wheels - and promised manufacturers "effective governance", not just "good governance". The campaign has three pillars: making it easier to do business by removing licensing and regulatory hurdles, enabling infrastructure such as industrial corridors, and opening up foreign direct investment in a number of sectors including defence, construction and railways. The National Manufacturing Policy aims to create 100 million jobs by 2022 and increase the share of manufacturing in India's GDP to 25 per cent.
Still, investors, like the FICCI survey hinted, remain cautious and are on a wait-and-watch mode. Modi is going in the right direction, they say, but they want more than just assurances.
CROUCHING LION
For 'Make in India' to succeed, the government needs to address the concerns of three sets of manufacturers - existing investors, those who want to expand in India, and foreign investors. Existing investors who have suffered setbacks because of recent court rulings need a high dose of the confidence opium.
"The private sector in India feels highly insecure. The government is not consistent, (and) a lot of reversals take place," says Ravi Uppal, Managing Director and Group CEO of Jindal Steel & Power. "Today, people are questioning the validity of any document given by the government. It comes to saying that any document given by the government must be endorsed by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, the Central Vigilance Commission, the Central Bureau of Investigation, and finally the Supreme Court before it becomes a valid document," he adds.
The Supreme Court recently cancelled the permits of 214 coal blocks allocated without auction between 1993 and 2010 by various governments. Miners have time till March 31, 2015, to hand over the mines to the government. Jindal Steel is one such company caught between a rock and a hard place. "We employ 30,000 people in our mines. They will be laid off," says Uppal. The company will not just face disruptions in coal supply, but also has a total investment of `36,000 crore at stake. "The opportunity lost will be in terms of future investment," he says.
The Modi government has to win back this fast receding investor confidence. "There needs to be consistency in government policy. There must be a legislation to say that when government decisions are made, they cannot be questioned. This kind of protection must be given," stresses Uppal.
Existing investors in India also need protection against outdated labour laws. Labour unions inside factories have been resorting to strikes and sabotage to press for higher wages and reverse disciplinary measures. In 2012, automaker Maruti Suzuki's Manesar plant faced a nasty labour strife, culminating in a management representative being charred to death. Another case in point is Parle Products's Bangalore factory. The company applied for closure of the plant after it could function for just three and half months between 2011 and 2013. Workers had halted production after an employee was suspended for abusing a personnel officer.
Toyota Kirloskar Motor faced similar problems this year. Between February 10 and March 15, the union at the carmaker led the disruption of shop-floor operations at its factory near Bangalore 32 times, resulting in a production loss of 1,988 vehicles, which led the company to declare a lockout. The lockout was subsequently lifted and management was eventually able to enforce discipline. "We cannot allow a minority to hold the majority to ransom," says Shekar Viswanathan, Vice Chairman and Director at Toyota Kirloskar Motor. "The labour department has to play a keen and instructive role, fostering better relations with management. Labour is a state subject. Every chief minister, labour secretary and junior functionary in the department must say we cannot compromise on discipline. It is management's right to enforce it," he adds.

Labour reform, agrees Surinder Kapur, Chairman of auto parts maker Sona Group, is needed to improve India's competitiveness. He says workforce in India is not disciplined enough. "In most factories, people are not working for eight hours. It varies from five to seven hours," he says. India's output per worker, at $3,067 in 2013, is nearly half of China's, according to the International Labour Organization.
In particular, industry groups and companies have been lobbying for a change in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. The Act mandates companies employing 100 or more workers to seek prior permission of the government for firing workers. Chapter V B of the Act bars companies from shutting shop or downsizing quickly - a company needs to seek permission from the government three months in advance. This locks up capital in unproductive assets. "Small and medium enterprises need to be given a holiday from labour laws for the next seven years, " says Kapur. "That's the kind of impetus you need."
A small start has already been made in this direction. On October 16, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched five initiatives under a new scheme titled Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Shramev Jayate Karyakram to address some of these problems. The initiatives include simplifying compliance of 16 labour laws through a single online form and a transparent Labour Inspection Scheme aimed at ending undue harassment by factory inspectors.
HANDLE THE ELEPHANT, TOO

Anyone, say manufacturers, can delay projects in India. In his Delhi office, replete with horse sketches, Puneet Dalmia narrates a tale of how a non-governmental organisation (NGO) threw a spanner in the works two years ago. The Managing Director of Dalmia Bharat Cement recalls that, at one of the company's greenfield projects, a local NGO claimed the road connecting its plant to the main road was in forest land. The company was dumbstruck because there was no forest there. But the NGO argued the region was an elephant track. "As a solution, the NGO wanted funding for elephant conservation. They came up with a `4 crore budget, saying they need to buy jeeps and laptops," says Dalmia. The company did not pay up but created an underpass for the animals to cross, if at all.
Often, projects get delayed also because some land owners don't want to sell their plots. "You may need to do 1,500 transactions to complete the entire land purchase since land holdings are small in India. You don't get contiguous land," says Dalmia. "There are patches that remain unsold. If you are stuck because of a small plot, you pay a hefty price. Then others who sold land a year back also come back to negotiate. This has happened many a time."
In the company's project costs, the maximum inflation has been in the price of land - 20 to 35 per cent a year across states. Dalmia Bharat Cement has operations in 14 states.
Other manufacturers face similar problems in land acquisition, which could lead to changes in business plans. German agro-equipment maker Lemken wanted to set up a plant in Pune in 2008 and was hunting for 20,000 square meters of land as the city had good infrastructure and skilled manpower, says CEO Arvind Kumar. But the company couldn't find a plot of land and finally went to Nagpur to set up the factory.
All these come at a time when foreign countries are aggressively looking to generate employment and are eyeing Indian investment. Apollo Tyres, for instance, is setting up a factory in Hungary that would employ 900. "We were chased by a number of countries - Slovakia, Poland, Hungary," says Onkar Kanwar, Chairman and Managing Director of Apollo Tyres. "We selected Hungary because our belief has been always to have a plant close to facilities where you know people can live and work properly. It's a one-and-a-half hour drive from Budapest." Kanwar is hesitant to link his expansion in Europe to the difficulty of getting things done in India but says land prices in India have become exorbitant. "Where we used to pay `10 lakh an acre, the same land is available for `1 crore now," he adds.
Adi Godrej, Chairman of the Godrej Group, points to a "funny law" that prohibits development of land under the Coastal Regulation Zones. "All coastal cities are badly affected by this - no other country in the world has such a law. Things like land reclamation is becoming difficult in India... All these come in the way of manufacturing development," he says.
Doing business has become tougher in the past few years, he adds. Too many permissions are required from too many agencies, and there are delays in environment clearances and land acquisition. To set up a cement plant, for instance, it takes 43 clearances from different agencies. "It becomes extremely complicated," says Godrej.
SO WHAT CAN MODI DO?
Godrej's solution - minimal permissions from the government, be it the state or the centre. "The government should have an adequate land bank. Simplification is the key to getting it done. The law of the land should be that if a certain permission is not granted within a certain period, say three months, then it is assumed to have been granted," he suggests.
Intricately linked to the high cost of land and the complexity of operating in India is the high cost of financing a project. Manufacturers want the government to relax lending norms. For instance, a steel plant of one million tonnes costs $1 billion and banks require promoter equity of 25 per cent for lending. "The promoter must have $250 million. Not many people have that kind of cash," says Uppal of Jindal Steel. "The government should have a guideline that says banks can go up to 90 per cent lending."
'Employment comes from manufacturing. Unfortunately, in the last 10 years, there has been a lot of talk, but no action. The result is we are stuck at 15 per cent (of GDP) in manufacturing,' says Onkar Kanwar, Chairman and Managing Director, Apollo Tyres. Picture: Shekhar Ghosh
Most domestic banks, laden with bad loans, may not agree with Uppal. But in many countries lending norms are easier and interest rates lower than in India, which works to the advantage of multinational companies. Jindal Steel, for instance, has set up a two-million-tonne steel plant in Oman. "Banks gave us money with a smile with favourable terms. The cost of loan is six per cent. In dollar terms, the rate is less than five per cent. India is at 12 per cent," says Uppal.
Smaller companies are being asked for personal guarantees by banks, says Kapur of Sona Group. "The stumbling block in automotive is that Tier-II and Tier-III suppliers are not growing at the pace they should because they are not being funded by banks. If suppliers don't grow, the alternative would be imports to overcome shortage. There is a cost to it," he adds. His company is taking vendors to banks, explaining to bankers that they need loans to operate.
S.V. Sukumar, Partner and Head of Strategy and Operations Practice at KPMG in India, says India must also ensure protection of intellectual property rights to boost manufacturing. "If high-end manufacturing comes to India, design will too. There must be protection for multinational companies R&D," he says.
INDIA SAFARI CUT SHORT
Foreign direct investors don't face a cash crunch. They have other headaches. Over the past few years, Indias income tax department has slapped tax evasion notices against multinationals ranging from Vodafone and Nokia to Shell India and General Electric. "Tax terrorism", a term that gained popularity in the run-up to general elections this year, includes retrospective taxation and claims on withholding tax. Both have earned India a bad name.
In 2012, the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government amended a law to retrospectively tax deals between any two companies if the underlying assets were in India, affecting mobile-phone operator Vodafone that had bought Hong Kong-based Hutchison Group's stake in Hutchison Essar. Similarly, Nokia has been slapped with two tax cases totalling `17,658 crore, and the implication has been disastrous for Indian manufacturing, employees and a growing electronic assembly ecosystem in Chennai. Nokia's Sriperumbudur factory, once the world's largest mobile-phone plant with 8,000 permanent employees producing 15 million handsets a month, will down shutters on November 1.
In February this year, the Tamil Nadu Sales Tax department slapped a tax case accusing Nokia of not having exported any of the mobile phones it manufactured at the plant between 2009 and 2011. "We find this claim surprising since we have customs documentation showing we exported more than 400 million phones during that period," a Nokia spokesperson had told Business Today earlier.
The second dispute relates to withholding tax. The Income Tax Department claimed `15,258 crore in unpaid taxes, interest and penalties as Nokia India showed the payments made for buying software from its head office in Finland as 'purchase transactions', not 'royalty payments'. While tax experts, such as Sanjay Sanghvi, Tax Partner at Khaitan & Co, say there was no tax liability in a purchase transaction concluded outside the country, authorities treated Nokia as a defaulter. Authorities also froze the company's manufacturing assets, preventing a transfer to Microsoft, which announced acquisition of Nokia's devices and services business in 2013. Nokia let go most of its employees and the plant became a contract manufacturer for Microsoft. The US-based company recently informed the handset maker it will terminate their manufacturing services pact from November 1, prompting Nokia to suspend production at the plant.
Brett Young, a corporate communications executive at Nokia Corporation, told BT the asset freeze by the tax department prevents the handset maker from exploring potential opportunities to sell the factory to any other company. "Nokia is now evaluating options to minimize the impact on the over 1,100 employees remaining at the manufacturing facility," he said in an e-mailed response. To attract investments, said Young, India should up set fast-tracks courts to resolve disputes and end practices that do more harm than good to all stakeholders - asset freezes being one example. "It is also critical to quickly resolve existing tax disputes sparked by retrospective taxation policy shifts. Companies that have operated with the same business model for many years, and have been regularly assessed and audited by the tax authorities, should be able to expect a reliable and consistent business environment," Young said.
But until India creates such an environment, manufacturing will resemble a lamb - not a lion. There is much work to be done before the cogs start to turn.

Sebi ban: DLF told to share fund plans for interim reliefSebi ban: DLF told to give fund-requirement plan for interim relief

As it fights a Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) ban on accessing capital markets, realty giant DLF has been asked to provide details of funds it immediately needs to get an interim relief to redeem capital locked in mutual funds.
While challenging the Sebi order barring it and six others, including top executives, from capital markets for three years, DLF had sought this interim relief on October 22, after which the capital markets regulator was asked to give a reply.
The regulator on Thursday submitted before the Securities and Appellate Tribunal (SAT) that the company can be given an interim relief, provided it gives a detailed proposal for requirement of funds it needs to redeem, by December 31.
DLF was asked to file an affidavit in this matter by Monday, after which SAT would issue directions on Wednesday (November 5) on whether the interim relief can be given. Subsequently, DLF has also been asked to submit its reply by December 8 to submissions made by the regulator with regard to the notice issued to it on the main appeal against the Sebi order.
After receiving DLF's reply, SAT would begin final hearing in the case on December 10.
Sebi has barred DLF and others for active and deliberate suppression of material information at the time of its IPO over seven years ago.
During the first hearing on October 22, Sebi had faced the flak for delay in passing the order and also for the adverse impact suffered by shareholders, who lost over Rs 7,500 crore of their wealth in a single day post the order.
While promoters own 74.93 per cent stake in DLF, foreign institutional investors have close to 20 per cent and retail shareholders have about 4 per cent, among others. This was one of the rare orders by Sebi where it barred a blue-chip firm and its top promoter/executives from market.
DLF's initial public offer in 2007 had fetched Rs 9,187 crore - the biggest IPO in the country at that time.

Arvind Mayaram, who was shunted from finance ministry to tourism ministry only a fortnight back, has now been transferred as Secretary in Minority Affairs Ministry even before he took charge of his new post.
"The Appointments Committee of Cabinet (ACC) has approved cancellation of order of appointment of Mayaram, a 1978 batch IAS officer of Rajasthan cadre, as Secretary, Ministry of Tourism," a statement issued on Thursday by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) said.
Mayaram had been replaced by Rajiv Mehrishi, who was Rajasthan Chief Secretary, as the Finance Secretary on October 15.
"The ACC has also approved that Ratan Ratan P Watal, Secretary, Department of Expenditure, Finance Ministry, will hold additional charge of Finance Secretary for a period of one month with immediate effect or until the assumption of charge by Mehrishi or until further orders, whichever is earlier," it said. Watal is a 1978 batch IAS officer of Andhra Pradesh cadre.
Mayaram has now been appointed as Secretary, Ministry of Minority Affairs, in place of Lalit K Panwar, the DoPT said. Panwar, a 1979 batch IAS officer of Rajasthan cadre, has been appointed as new Secretary in Ministry of Tourism, it said.

Black money list: Some unanswered questions about the 627 namesprint
The government's first list of black money account holders has named Pankaj Chimanlal Lodhya (L), Radha Timblo (C) and Pradip Burman. (PTI and ANI photos)
The black money storm raging in India is centered on names in the so called HSBC list that the country had received from France in 2011. The story though starts in December 2008, when a systems engineer who worked at the HSBC's Geneva branch fled to France with data on nearly 25,000 bank accounts.
 
Hervé Falciani, a whistleblower now known as the 'Edward Snowden of Swiss banking', handed over the encrypted information he had been hoarding to French authorities. Based on his exposure a list of more than 125,000 potential fraudsters from around the world emerged.
 
French authorities shared the names with other countries including India. What did the others do with the names from the same "stolen" list? They certainly didn't make them public. France claims it recovered €186 million (3,000 names from the list), Spain €260 million (700 names) and UK £135 million (4,000 names).
These countries claim they are continuing to work towards recovering more money from entities on the list. But what does India have to show? No clear picture has emerged yet. The government has promised big revelations, but will it announce how much money it has recovered or is confident of being able to recover?
 
Many other questions remained unanswered in India. France said it didn't need more information from Switzerland because Falciani's data had everything they needed. So how is it that India still needs info from Switzerland even though it has names from the same list? Does it mean France did not share all the data? It's not clear exactly how many names were there on the original list. If there were 800 names in the original list as reported and 627 names have been submitted to the Supreme Court, what has happened to the rest? Were those names cleared?
None of the other countries that had a share of the HSBC list saw such a passionate public demand to name and shame. The focus there was firmly set on the investigation and judicial processes, but in India there is a clamour see names come out into the open. This seems to be driven by the desire to expose the nexus between politicians, officials and big business.
 
The Supreme Court ruled that only the special investigation team (SIT) chairperson and vice chairperson can open the sealed envelope containing names of account holders. India maybe under legal obligation to not make the names public but at the same time the government's allegiance to the judicial system obliges it to create the right conditions to bring offenders to book. Lack of progress in investigation raises suspicions and justifies public demand for increased transparency.
The sensationalism around black money eclipses the more important need for a greater understanding of the mechanics of tax evasion and money laundering. Public opinion can only press the government for effective and long-term action if there's more sombre analysis rather than heated headlines followed by long spells of public amnesia.
 
There are three simple and obvious things to remember. The burden of proof is on India so if India's own investigation is rock solid, tax havens and banking secrecy jurisdictions will be under tremendous pressure, if not obligation, to cooperate. Forging strong bilateral and multilateral treaties are the only way to open up channels of information and to escape traps set by such jurisdictions. And the most important: time lost is money lost.
Public frustration with the idea of vast sums draining to offshore accounts should lead to more than just an appetite for a spectacle. The dragging of offenders into the public eye can only bring short lived and misplaced gratification.
It is not clear what important revelations the government plans to make over the next few days. But it could start by announcing what steps are being taken to implement the new global automatic information exchange system that India, as part of G-20 nations, had committed to in 2013.

Analysts expected the company to report a net income of Rs 828 crore, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Net sales of the company, famous for its low-cost, entry-level compact cars, rose 17.5 per cent to Rs 11,996 crore in the July-September quarter, the company said in a statement on Thursday.
Maruti said its board has decided to recommend an increase in the foreign institutional investor (FII) holding limit in the company to 40 per cent, broadly the level of public shareholding in the stock, subject to approvals.
As of 2.28 p.m. shares in Maruti Suzuki traded 1.7 per cent higher at Rs 3,259 apiece outperforming the broader Nifty, which was up 0.8 per cent.

DLF Asked to Give Fund-requirement Plans for Interim ReliefAviation Regulator Acts Tough Against Troubled SpiceJet: Report
Mumbai: As it fights a Sebi ban on accessing capital markets, realty giant DLF was asked on Thursday to provide details of funds it immediately needs to get an interim relief to redeem capital locked in mutual funds.
While challenging the Sebi order barring it and six others, including top executives, from capital markets for three years, DLF had sought this interim relief on October 22, after which the capital markets regulator was asked to give a reply.
The regulator today submitted before SAT that the company can be given an interim relief, provided it gives a detailed proposal for requirement of funds it needs to redeem, by December 31.
DLF was asked to file an affidavit in this matter by Monday, after which SAT would issue directions on Wednesday (November 5) on whether the interim relief can be given.
Subsequently, DLF has also been asked to submit its reply by December 8 to submissions made by the regulator with regard to the notice issued to it on the main appeal against the Sebi order.
After receiving DLF's reply, SAT would begin final hearing in the case on December 10. Sebi has barred DLF and others for "active and deliberate suppression" of material information at the time of its IPO over seven years ago.
During the first hearing on October 22, Sebi had faced the flak for delay in passing the order and also for the adverse impact suffered by shareholders, who lost over Rs 7,500 crore of their wealth in a single day post the order.
While promoters own 74.93 per cent stake in DLF, foreign institutional investors have close to 20 per cent and retail shareholders have about 4 per cent, among others.
This was one of the rare orders by Sebi where it barred a blue-chip firm and its top promoter/executives from market.
DLF's initial public offer in 2007 had fetched Rs 9,187 crore - the biggest IPO in the country at that time.
The case has also brought to limelight 'technicalities' involved in the practice of Sebi giving 'observations' and not 'approval or clearance' for an IPO.
There is a view that regulators need to understand that the business practices tend to be different in real estate sector, from manufacturing or other segments of the economy.
However, others feel that regulations cannot be overlooked to accommodate certain 'prevailing practices' in one particular sector, such as those related to use of 'friendly' entities for purchase of land or development rights in the name of ease of doing business.

Maruti Suzukis net profit jumps by 28.7 per cent on volumegrowthMaruti Suzuki India sold 3,21,898 units of vehicles during Q2, a growth of 16.80 per cent. (Reuters)
Written by Sandeep Singh | New Delhi | Posted: October 30, 2014 4:16 pm
Driven by a strong volume growth of 16.8 per cent and net sales growth of 17.5 per cent in the quarter ended September 2014, Maruti Suzuki saw its net profit jump by 28.7 per cent to Rs 862.5 crore over the same period last year.
In another development that may have a bearing on shareholders of the company, MSIL announced that its board of directors have recommended to raise the FII shareholding limit in the company from existing 24 per cent to 40 per cent. This however remains a proposal for now as it needs the shareholder approval and then will have to await RBI’s nod.
The company’s board also approved its dividend payout guideline which states that the dividend payout will now range between 18 and 30 per cent each year. In the year ended March 2014, the company had a dividend payout ratio of 15 per cent.
While the company is looking to come out with various products going forward, the market leader said that its new SUV will be launched in the first quarter of next year.
Shares of the company rose on the back of the result and closed with a gain of 1.1 per cent at a high of Rs 3,242 on Thursday before hitting an all time high of Rs 3,297 per share.

Lenovo Yoga Tablet 2 review: Is this the best Android tablet at Rs20 990Print
The Lenovo Yoga Tablet 2 is one of the best value for money Android tablets in the market at the moment.
Written by Nandagopal Rajan | New Delhi | Posted: October 30, 2014 4:15 pm | Updated: October 30, 2014 6:26 pm
The Android tablet space is choc-a-bloc with too many devices and brands. So many that it is hard to find more than a handful of devices that stand apart thanks to performance or innovation. There is, however, a new entrant to this list… one that could spoil the party for a lot of others. Meet the Lenovo Yoga Tablet 2.
Specs: 8-inch 1920 x 1200 IPS display | Intel Atom Z3745 quad-core 1.86GHz processor | 2GB RAM | 16GB internal storage expandable up to 64GB | 8MP rear camera + 1.6MP front | Li-Ion 6400 mAh battery | Android 4.4.2 Kitkat
Price: Rs 20,990
Design
Without a doubt this tablet has the most innovative design at the moment. This 8-inch tablet, and rest of the series, introduces the kickstand which the simple prop that it is lets you use the tablet in three different modes. With the stand turned outwards, you can make the tablet stand for content consumption, lie down for when you want to write or hang from a wall if you are glancing at it during work. And adding a little hinge on one end makes it easier to hold too, like Sony showed us with the Tablet S a few years back.
The only issue that when you start out it’s hard to figure out how to open the kickstand. It seems Lenovo figured this out too and there is a sticker to explain the simple twist. Behind the stand is the flap that holds the SD card and micro-SIM. At one end of its hinge is the power button and on other the power port, the design couldn’t have been better. My only issue is that there is just one micro USB port on the entire device and that could be a bit limiting for some users.
Display and Sound
It is not always that you get a full HD display at this price point. The display is sharp and bright and great for consuming videos, even from a distance. And with Dolby Audio on JBL speakers this tablet has the best audio quality and volume in town. It can be as loud as a television if needed.
Performance
The tablet is powered by a 1.86GHz Intel Atom Z3745 Quad Core processor and is a great work horse. Multi-tasking is smooth and there is absolutely no lag when using the apps or even browsing with multiple tabs on. However, I experienced some heating issues, especially while streaming videos on YouTube and that is rare on Atom tablets.
Software
This is the tricky bit. I am not sure all of us will be happy with Lenovo’s tweaked UI for Android KItkat. It is ideal for tablet use and it not run off the mill smartphone UI, but the new icons need getting used too. It is a bit like Color OS, either you like it or you just hate it. But there are some really good pre-loaded apps in the mix.
Camera
The rear camera is decent, but not great in low light or for shooting indoors. The rear lens is also on the hinge and you will have to flip the tablet every time you want to shoot with it as the natural tendency is to have the heavier side facing down. But I still think the camera is just an appendage for the tablet that should be used only for video calls. I am sure a lot of you don’t agree and would still use it to shoot the Taj.
Connectivity
The Yoga Tablet 2 is a 3G/Wi-Fi device and offers great mobility. No issues on this front.
Battery
This is another plus point for this tablet. Lenovo is promising 18 hours and given its track record with smartphones I am more than inclined to believe it. Anyway, I could use it for a full day on a 3G network on full charge. That should be enough for most users.
Verdict
Given the price point of Rs 20,990, the Lenovo Yoga Tablet 2 is one of the best value for money Android tablets in the market at the moment. It gives you great functionality, a FullHD screen, good battery life and an overall experience that is better than what you have paid for.

US commando who killed Bin Laden to revealidentityPrint
By: Agence-France Presse | Washington | Posted: October 30, 2014 4:05 pm
The US Navy Seal commando who fired the shots which killed Al-Qaeda chief Osama Bin Laden is to reveal his identity in a television documentary next month, the network announced.
“The Man Who Killed Osama Bin Laden” will air in two segments November 11-12, with the commando recounting his rolein the raid that killed Bin Laden at his Pakistani compound in 2011.
The Navy SEAL “will share his story of training to be a member of America’s elite fighting force and explain his involvement in Operation Neptune Spear, the mission that killed Bin Laden,” the network said in a press release.
“Offering never before shared details, the presentation will include ‘The Shooter’s’ experience in confronting Bin Laden, his description of the terrorist leader’s final moments as well as what happened when he took his last breath,” it said.
The program would also offer a look at a “secret” ceremony in which the commando donated the shirt he was wearing during the mission to the National September 11 Memorial & Museum in New York City, it said.
The daring nighttime raid on May 2, 2011 saw a team of Navy SEALs in Blackhawk helicopters swooping on Bin Laden’s hideout in Abbottabad. There were no casualties among US forces, who killed Bin Laden and four others at the compound.
The operation was ordered by President Barack Obama after the CIA traced Bin Laden’s courier to the high-walled compound.

China cautions India over new borderpostsChina urged India "not to do things that may complicate the situation." (Source: IE archive)
By: AP | Beijing | Posted: October 30, 2014 4:03 pm
China’s Defense Ministry cautioned New Delhi on Thursday over India’s plans to construct 54 new border posts along an eastern stretch of their disputed frontier.
Spokesman Yang Yujun said China urged India to do more to maintain peace and stability in the area and “not to do things that may complicate the situation.”
The long-festering border dispute continues to bedevil relations between the giant Asian neighbors,  armed with nuclear weapons and with 2.6 billion people between them, despite a recent warming of relations.
Suspicions date from a month-long border war in 1962 that killed about 2,000 soldiers. That conflict ended in a standoff with each side accusing the other of occupying its territory.
As recently as September, Indian and Chinese troops faced off along the border, even as their leaders were promising to boost economic cooperation and substantially increase Chinese investment in India’s infrastructure at a rare meeting.
China claims about 90,000 square kilometers (35,000 square miles) of land in India’s northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, while India says China is occupying 38,000 square kilometers (15,000 square miles) of territory on the Aksai Chin plateau to the west.
China only acknowledges a dispute in the eastern section of the border and has refused to stamp Chinese visas inside the Indian passports of citizens from Arunachal Pradesh.
India also recently announced plans to build new roads inside the disputed area to keep up with China’s development of transport links and airstrips on its side of the line-of-control.

Blackmoney: Gathering more names other than the over 600 account holders  saysSITPrint
Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi had on Thursday submitted a list of 627 names having accounts in HSBC bank. (Source: Express archive)

The Supreme Court -appointed SIT, looking into the blackmoney cases on Thursday said it will go after the offenders “big or small” but made it clear that confidentiality about account holders abroad will not be violated.
It also said it was gathering more names other than the over 600 account holders in HSBC bank, Geneva, given by the government to Supreme Court on wednesday for investigation.
“Before us, nobody is big, nobody is small. Everybody is equal. Whoever has looted this country will be caught and will be punished, economically and otherwise also. That we assure. Both of us (SIT chief Justice Shah) are too well known for doing it to discomfort of many people,” Vice Chairman Justice Arijit Pasayat said.
Justice Shah said up till now they have decided a number of cases against the big personalities of the country. “We won’t bother who is big. We will treat them equally with a poorest person of the country,” he told television channels. Both are retired judges of Supreme Court.
Amidst a raging debate over disclosure of names of foreign bank accounts holders that could threaten future cooperation with other countries, the SIT chairman said confidentiality agreement cannot be violated.
“Confidentiality is an international agreement. You cannot violate the agreement. If you violate it, further information would not be given by them and confirmation by other country is necessary. There is a proof that man is having that account. That proof you won’t get it,” he said.
Justice Shah said the investigation against people accused of stashing money abroad is going on at “very fast” pace and necessary action will be taken against them.
“It’s difficult for me to say when we are going to get money back. But at least investigation is going on very fast and it would give some results,” he said.
Justice Shah said the the pace of investigation is not slow. The department is required to follow procedures like issuing notices, hearing the person and thereafter the order can be passed.
“Even if the order is passed, party approaches the court and obtain a stay order. So in that set of circumstances, it is difficult to say that department is not moving fast. The department is moving fast. They (department and officials) have taken action also,” he said.
Justice Shah said there will be more prosecution of people who have stashed blackmoney “within the reasonable time”. The SIT is also sharing data with other agencies to help it in speeding up its probe, he said.
Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi had on Thursday submitted a list of 627 names having accounts in HSBC bank, Geneva. These names were earlier shared with the SIT also.
“At present we have 627 (names). Further apart from 627, there are other names which we are gathering also. (we) trying to gather it and it would be investigated continued…

Satyam case verdict likely on December23By: Press Trust of India | Hyderabad | Posted: October 30, 2014 4:02 pm
A special court here will pronounce its verdict on December 23 in the accounting fraud in the erstwhile Satyam Computer Services Limited, nearly six years after the multi-crore rupee scam jolted corporate India.
Special judge B V L N Chakravarthi fixed December 23 for pronouncement of the much-awaited judgement. All the ten accused in the case, including prime accused Satyam Computers founder and former chairman B Ramalinga Raju and his brother and Satyam’s former MD B Rama Raju, appeared in the court, as per its direction.
The media were not allowed inside the court.
“Case is posted for judgement on December 23. In all probability, it (verdict) will be delivered on that date, failing which, because of the volume of the case, it might take a few days more if at all,” CBI’s special Public Prosecutor K Surender said.
The others accused in the case are ex-CFO Vadlamani Srinivas, former PwC auditors Subramani Gopalakrishnan and T Srinivas, Raju’s another brother B Suryanarayana Raju, former employees G Ramakrishna, D Venkatpathi Raju and Ch Srisailam, and Satyam’s former internal chief auditor V S Prabhakar Gupta.
The court, in the meanwhile, heard arguments by the defence and prosecution after Raju had filed an application before it challenging the authenticity of some of the electronic evidence presented by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) that investigated the fraud.
The defence contended that some of the electronic evidence submitted against Raju and the others accused was inadmissible because it was not retrieved in accordance with provisions of the Evidence Act.
Touted as the country’s biggest accounting fraud, the scam came to light on January 7, 2009, after Ramalinga Raju allegedly confessed to manipulating his company’s account books and inflating profits over many years to the tune of several crores of rupees.
Raju was arrested by the Crime Investigation Department of Andhra Pradesh Police two days later along with his brother Rama Raju and others.
Raju and others were charged with offences like cheating, criminal conspiracy, forgery and breach of trust under relevant sections of IPC for inflating invoices and incomes, account falsification, faking fixed deposits, besides allegedly falsifying returns through violation of
various I-T laws.
In February that year, the CBI took over investigation and filed three charge sheets (on April 7, 2009, November 24, 2009 and January 7, 2010), which were later clubbed into one.
Around 3,000 documents were marked and 226 witnesses were examined.
Raju later retracted his confession statement and contended that all charges levelled by the CBI were false.
During the trial, the CBI alleged that the scam caused a loss of Rs 14,000 crore to Satyam shareholders, while the defence countered the charges saying the accused were not responsible for the fraud and all the documents filed by the central agency relating to the case were fabricated and not according to law.
At present, all the accused are out on continued…

Nilofar to hit western Rajasthan by evening: MeTPrint
By: Press Trust of India | Jaipur | Posted: October 30, 2014 3:47 pm | Updated: October 30, 2014 3:53 pm
Cyclonic storm Nilofar is most likely to hit western regions of Rajasthan by Thursday evening causing moderate to heavy rains, a MeT official said.
Rains are likely to occur in Jalore, Barmer, and Jaisalmer districts due to Nilofar’s residual effect, state MeT Director B N Vishnoi said, adding, rainy weather would probably also cover Jodhpur and Pali districts by night.
The cyclone would have a mild affect in Rajasthan’s border districts of Barmer, Jalore, and Jodhpur, he said.
Jaipur and surrounding areas was receiving high moisture with development of clouds as residual movement and there might be rains in northern region, he said.
Cyclone’s eye was still to touch Gujarat’s Kutch area and its front area would be spreading in western region of Rajasthan, he said.
“It is not clear whether high speed wind would be blowing across western Rajasthan, as present speed of cyclone was around 70-80 km per hour. High wind requires more than 80 km per hour of speed to affect the weather and surroundings,” he said.
The BSF has already sounded alert along the border line of Jaisalmer-Srigangangar-Barmer-Bikaner in view of Nilofar cyclone, a senior BSF official told PTI.
“In view of the cyclone effect, BSF has cautioned its troops to be more vigilant as any kind of dust storm could raise poor visibility on the border. Hence to keep constant vigilance, jawans would be given sun glasses to protect themselves from dust storm or strong winds during Nilofar’s entry, if any,” he said.
BSF jawans would also be made available to meet any exigency in public domain in case the cyclone gets aggressive, he said.
District administrations of border areas have alerted their disaster management teams to be alert with all gadgets to meet any challenge, an official said.

Kerala bar ban: HC upholds Chandy govt s orderKerala HC upholds liquor ban, 700 bars to be shut
HT correspondent , Hindustan Times  Thiruvananthapuram, October 30, 2014

Comments
The Kerala High Court on Thursday upheld the state government’s decision to close down about 700 bars in a boost for the administration which aims to make the state alcohol-free by 2023.
The court, however, allowed heritage and four-star hotels to serve liquor apart from five-star ones that were already exempted.
Kerala has India’s highest per capita alcohol consumption at more than eight litres per person annually while the national average is 5.7 litres.
Bar owners and hoteliers who had challenged the government order in the high court said they will now approach the Supreme Court.
The Congress party-led UDF government has closed more than 400 bars since March by not renewing their operating licences.
“It’s a welcome move. Our aim is total prohibition in a phased manner,” said chief minister Oommen Chandy on the high court order.
The government’s decision came this year after many members of the political class complained about increased underage drinking, a binge-drinking culture and drinking by women in the state.
Thursday’s verdict means the liquor bars in 33 four-star hotels, 21 five-star hotels and eight heritage properties can function.
Total prohibition would cause a monetary loss of about Rs. 9,000 crore a year to the state as sale of alcohol is a key source of revenue for Kerala apart from Gulf remittances.
The government would also have to rehabilitate nearly 25,000 workers at bar hotels who would lose their jobs.
Bar owners say with the alcohol ban Kerala would lose much of its charm as a tourism spot and people would opt for nearby destinations like Goa or Sri Lanka.

Bengal: Naqvi  other BJP leaders briefly held during Birbhum visitComments
Members of a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) team were briefly arrested on Thursday as it tried to enter Makra village in Bengal where three persons were killed on Monday when alleged Trinamool Congress workers tried to recapture the village which has reportedly turned to the BJP since the Lok Sabha polls.
 
Party vice-president Mukthar Abbas Naqvi, Lok Sabha MPs Kirti Azad and Udit Raj, state party president Rahul Sinha and others allegedly tried to defy security restrictions to enter the village 200km away from Kolkata in south Bengal.
West Bengal's home department had this morning sent a fax to the BJP office in Kolkata, asking the politicians not to enter Makra and adjoining villages where Section 144, a law restricting the assembly of people, has been imposed.
 
"If the state government put half the effort they are putting in arresting us into curbing terrorism, the state of West Bengal would have been in a better condition," said Naqvi before being taken to a police station in a bus.
 
"The state government has clamped Section 144 to prevent us from entering the village. If the police allowed four of us to enter, it would not have violated the Section. The government is just trying to prevent the villagers from speaking to us and breaking its own law in the process," said Sinha.
 
"We have been stuffed in a bus. I can't even say how many of us have been arrested," said state BJP spokesperson Ritesh Tiwari over phone.
 
Hundreds of villagers protested against the police and demanded that they be allowed to speak to the BJP leaders. The BJP team came to Kolkata on Thursday morning and is supposed to go back and submit a report to party president Amit Shah.
Police released all the BJP leaders and supporters after half an hour.
 
On Wednesday, teams from the state Congress, state BJP and the Left parties were prevented from entering the village.

Terming lieutenant governor Najeeb Jung's move to talk to all political parties on forming a government in Delhi as "positive", the Supreme Court on Thursday adjourned hearing on the matter to November 11.
"There could be a minority government with outside support of a political outfit. Let us wait for some time," the Supreme Court said while hearing a plea from the Aam Aadmi Party on dissolving the assembly and holding fresh polls in Delhi.
Referring to recent media reports, a five-judge constitution bench headed by Chief Justice HL Dattu said, "Whatever I have read in newspapers, it appears that the L-G has made positive moves."  
The bench asked Prashant Bhushan, counsel for AAP, to file a plea seeking dissolution of the Assembly, to wait for sometime as the L-G had started the consultation process with the political players in the national capital and adjourned the matter till November 11.
During the brief hearing, the bench also comprising justices J Chelameswar, A K Sikri, R K Agrawal and Arun Mishra, said that if the LG feels that there is a possibility of government formation, then he should be given time to explore it.
L-G Najeeb Jung, who returned from abroad Wednesday,  had met Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and called the BJP, Congress and AAP to discuss any possibility of forming a government.
"In view of the President's approval to explore the possibility of installing a popular government in Delhi, the Lt Governor would be exploring the possibilities with the leaders of all political parties over the next few days," LG's office had said.
BJP, which is the single largest party, is yet to give any clear signal on its strategy but there were indications that the party was preparing for fresh polls in January or February.
Sources said BJP president Amit Shah and Union ministers Nitin Gadkari and Rajnath Singh were in favour of the party forming a government while some others were of the view that it should not run away from polls when Prime Minister Narendra Modi's rating was high.
"There is a possibility of the party turning down offer of government formation," a senior party leader told PTI.
The L-G's decision to begin consultations with the political parties came a day after a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice H L Dattu slammed the Centre and the Lt Governor for delay in taking a decision on government formation in Delhi.
AAP and Congress had come down hard on Jung, questioning his move to hold consultation with the parties when it was clear that no party was in a position to provide a stable government.
Currently BJP, along with ally Akali Dal's lone MLA, has 29 legislators and will require the support of five more MLAs to prove majority in the 67-member assembly if it decides to form the government.

Economic Survey pegs GDP growth at 5.4-5.9%economic indicator
The Economic Survey 2013-14, which was tabled on Wednesday in the Lok Sabha, has pegged GDP growth for the year 2014-15 in the range of 5.4-5.9 per cent.
"There are downside risks to the economy arising from a poor monsoon, the external environment and the poor investment climate. GDP growth slowed to below 5 per cent for two consecutive years, i.e. 2012-13 and 2013-14. The combination of domestic structural constraints, inflationary pressures, particularly food inflation and uncertainty in the global economy, has affected growth and posed challenges for macroeconomic stability," said the Survey.
Agriculture and allied sector grew at 4.7 per cent, while industry grew at 0.4 per cent in 2013-14.
"The key reasons for poor performance have been contraction in mining activities and deceleration in manufacturing output. Manufacturing and mining sector GDP declined by 0.7 per cent and 1.4 per cent respectively in 2013-14. The underlying cause of the poor performance of these two sectors has been considerable deceleration in investment, particularly by the private corporate sectorduring 2011-12 and 2012-13," it said.
Consumer price inflation declined from 10.21 per cent during FY 2013-14 to about 9.49 per cent in 2013-14. However, food inflation remained stubbornly high during FY 2013-14. Contribution of the commodity sub-groups, ‘fruits and vegetables’, as well as ‘egg, meat and fish’ to the food inflation has been very high.
India’s balance-of-payments position improved in 2013-14 with current account deficit (CAD) at 32.4 billion (1.7 per cent of GDP) as against $88.2 billion (4.7 per cent of GDP) in 2012-13.
"India's exports at $312.6 billion grew by a positive 4.1 per cent compared to the previous year’s negative growth of 1.8 percent. Import growth decelerated from 0.3 per cent in 2012-13 to a negative 8.3 per cent in 2013-14, owing to fall in non-oil imports by 12.8 per cent primarily due to restrictions on gold imports," said the document.
But public finances faced serious challenges, with a shortfall in tax revenues and disinvestment receipts and higher than budgeted subsidies, interest and pension payments, fiscal consolidation was mainly achieved through a reduction in grants for creation of capital assets and capital expenditure.
"An important factor in the increase in the Centre’s fiscal deficit after 2008-09 has been the sharp increase in subsidies from 1.42 per cent of GDP in 2007-08 to 2.56 per cent of GDP in 2012-13. For 2013-14 the subsidy bill is 2.26 per cent of GDP," it said.
The Survey identifies the need to address long run problems to improve the investment climate. It emphasises the need for creating a framework for low and stable inflation, setting public finances on a sustainable path by tax and expenditure reform, and creating the legal and institutionalframework for a well-functioning market economy.
"The Survey calls for putting public finances on the sustainable path through fiscal correction, a new Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act with teeth, better accounting practices, greater transparency and improved budgetary management. It argues that improvements on both tax and expenditure are needed to obtain high quality fiscal adjustment," said a press release.
This year's Economic Survey also discusses the need for revamping some of the social sector schemes such as MNREGA, NRHM, SSA, etc.
"It is felt that the outlays for the different schemes have not often translated fully into outcomes owing to the poor delivery mechanism. Leveraging modern technology for efficient delivery of programmes, removing the multiple layers of governance, simplifying procedures, and greater participatory role by the beneficiaries can help in creating a better delivery mechanism," it said.

Power generation fell short by nearly 8 billion units of the target of 975 billion units in the last financial year.
“Electricity generation by the utilities was targeted at 975 billion units of which 967.15 billion units was achieved during the financial year 2013-14,” the pre-budget survey tabled in Parliament on Wednesday said.
However, the power generation in 2013-14 was higher by 6 per cent compared to production of 912.06 billion units in 2012-13.
The electricity generation through thermal power plants grew by 8.3 per cent in 2013-14. Power production from gas-based plants declined by 33.4 per cent during the year, the survey said.
The government has set a target of generating over 1,023 billion units of power during in the current financial year.
Megawatt (MW) refers to generation capacity while million units indicates the amount of power or energy produced. One MW capacity can produce 1,000 units of power in one hour.
Electricity generation by the utilities was targeted at 975 billion units of which 967.15 billion units was achieved during the financial year 2013-14
Abysmal performance of the gas-based projects was due to lack of fuel. As much as 24,000 MW capacity of gas-based stations in the country was stranded due to lack of fuel.
But the overall efficiency of the thermal power stations from April, 2013, to March, 2014, declined to 65.55 per cent from 70.13 per cent in 2012-13 fiscal.
The Plant Load Factor (PLF), a measure of efficiency of power stations, of state-sector utilities remained lower than that of private-sector and central-sector utilities, the survey stated.
The peak power deficit — shortfall in electricity supply when the demand is maximum — declined to 4.5 per cent in 2013-14 from 9 per cent in 2012-13.
It stood at 10.6 per cent in the terminal year (2011-12) of the previous Five Year Plan Period (2007-12).
The capacity addition target for the 12th plan period (2012-17) is estimated at 88,537 MW comprising 26,182 MW in the central sector, 15,530 MW in the state sector and 46,825 MW in the private sector respectively.
The country missed the capacity addition target for 2013-14. “The capacity addition target for the year 2013-14 was 18,432.3 MW against which a capacity addition target of 17,825.1 MW has been achieved,” the survey said.
However, the country surpassed the capacity addition target in 2012-13. The target was 17,956.3 MW against which 20,622.8 MW was generated. A lion’s share of 20,121.8 MW was contributed by thermal power plants.

Survey favours direct cash subsidies for BPL households
The government’s pre-budget Economic Survey has suggested payment of subsidy in cash for those below poverty line through technologies like biometric identification, observing that such support lead to distorted resource allocation which hamper changes in prices.
The Narendra Modi led government’s first survey pointed that not all the money put into subsidy schemes reaches the poor while attributing rise in fiscal deficit after 2008-09 to increase in subsidies.
“Subsidy programmes are particularly problematic when they hamper changes in prices and the consequent shifts in resource allocation which must take place.”
“Therefore, it is increasingly feasible to identify households below the poverty line and give them cash. The new technologies of biometric identification and payments through mobile phones have created a range of new possibilities for the design of programmes,” the survey said.
Subsidies were badly targeted, with the richest 10 per cent of the households benefiting seven times more than the poorest 10 per cent from these subsidies. Survey favours direct cash subsidies for BPL households
The economic document further elaborated that programmes such as food subsidy have huge overhead costs. In other cases, such as the fertiliser subsidy, the expenditures generate a distorted resource allocation that hampers productivity, it said.
Citing an example, it said: “When the price of diesel rises, in the medium term the economy shifts away from diesel.
But this adaption is blocked if the price of diesel is not actually raised. When the purchase price of cereals is raised, cereal production becomes more attractive, even though consumers might want more non-cereals.”
“As per the Controller General of Accounts (CGA), the major subsidies in 2013-14 amounted to Rs 2,47,596 crore, well above revised estimates,” the survey underlined.
It also added that food subsidy has been increasing owing to the widening gap between economic cost of procurement by the FCI and the central issue price fixed under the Public Distribution System.
In case of oil subsidies, the economic document raised concerns on the issue of under-recoveries of the oil marketing companies having been almost doubled to Rs 1,39,869 crore in 2013-14 from Rs 77,123 crore in 2007-08.
Quoting an IMF working paper titled The fiscal and welfare impacts of fuel subsidies in India, the survey said they were badly targeted, with the richest 10 per cent of the households benefiting seven times more than the poorest 10 per cent from these subsidies.
Similarly, the plan panel’s food subsidies performance evaluation report has pointed that in the targeted PDS states, for every kg of grains delivered to poor, the government released 2.4 kg from the central pool, the survey added.

economy (general)
Multiple controls and plethora of orders are hindering the growth of wholesale and retail trade in India, which has slipped to 14th position in global retail development index last year from fifth in 2012, according to the pre-Budget Economic Survey 2013-14.
As per the survey, the trade sector that comprises wholesale and retail grew by 4.8 per cent to Rs 14.79 lakh crore in 2012-13, accounted for 15.8 per cent share in the GDP.
However, unfavourable macro economic conditions and a host of controls have slowed down the growth of the sector.
“Both wholesale and retail trade within the country is governed by many controls, multiple organisations and plethora of orders. This has resulted in fragmented market and hindering the free flow of goods within the economy, higher transportation cost, and in general a lower level of efficiency and productivity,” the survey document said.
It further said: “Unfettered flow of goods and services is an essential pre—requisite for building a common national market that will promote growth and trace across regions and also enable specialisation and higher levels of economic efficiency.”
India slipped to 14th rank in 2013 as against 5th ranked in 2012. India was in first place is 2009.
Citing AT Kearney’s global retail development index, the Economic Survey said: “India slipped to 14th rank in 2013 as against 5th ranked in 2012. India was in first place is 2009“.
Pointing out factors that affected growth of retail sector in the country, survey said: “High operating costs, low bargaining power with vendors and heavy discounting to improve sales have affected profit and expansion plans.”
“Real estate cost and space availability also remain important issues,” the survey added.
However, it pointed out that the long-term fundamentals of the sector remain strong.
“Retail growth of 14-15 per cent per year is expected through 2015,” it added.
In order to boost growth in the trade sector, the government allowed 100 per cent FDI in single brand retail in 2012. The government also allowed 51 per cent investment in multi—brand retail with conditions related to investment, sourcing, etc.

GrubHub founder buys six-bedroom, 7,000-square-foot vintage mansion in Lincoln Park
Matt Maloney, the co-founder and CEO of Chicago-based GrubHub Seamless, and his wife paid $3.44 million this month for a six-bedroom, 7,000-square-foot vintage mansion in Lincoln Park.
GrubHub Seamless went public this year. Maloney co-founded GrubHub and then oversaw its merger with Seamless last year.
Built in 1886, the mansion that Maloney and his wife bought had been on the market since April, when it was listed for $4.9 million. Its owners reduced the asking price to $4.5 million, $3.9 million and then to $3.7 million.

Griffin: Wife still using credit cards for luxury goods8
Griffin is asking the court to order that she not be entitled to exclusive possession of the 66th floor, which he says has a separate address, entrance and security system. Dias Griffin's name doesn't appear on the title to that floor, he said.
Griffin's filing also notes that Dias Griffin also owns two full floors in another luxury high-rise in downtown Chicago. Griffin later bought his in-laws another floor in the same high-rise so they could be close to their grandchildren.
His Wednesday filing was in response to an earlier petition by Dias Griffin to the court.
She had noted that many of her expenses are inseparable from the children's, including household staff and travel on two private airplanes. She is seeking temporary child support and full payment of the staff under her control, as well as to maintain the status quo with regard to her credit and debit cards and bank accounts. Dias Griffin is also seeking exclusive possession of the three floors in their high-rise, noting that he now has a separate residence.

Matchmakers find modern fans in the digital ageMatchmakers find modern fans in the digital age
What's behind the business of matchmaking?

Tired of online dating? Personal matchmaking is gaining popularity.
Traditional matchmaking is finding a market among singles looking for better connections.
Even online dating sites like eHarmony and Match.com are turning to personal matchmaking.
The Internet has upended innumerable traditional business models. Travel agents. Retail stores. Newspapers (sigh).
Yet online dating, which has ballooned into a $2.1 billion industry used by almost 40 percent of dating singles, hasn't killed one of the most old-fashioned professions of all: matchmakers.
Some of these professional cupids say they are seeing renewed and expanded interest in their services as disillusioned digital daters trade computer algorithms for human judgment.
A matchmaking school is reporting growing enrollment.
Even online dating behemoths Match.com and eHarmony.com have invested in personal matchmaking services in the past year that charge several thousand dollars for human attention.
While online dating has shed much of its stigma as it becomes the norm, people tend to be more shy about publicly discussing their matchmaking experiences. Several people interviewed for this article asked not to be identified by their full names to keep that personal detail out of the public... ( Alexia Elejalde-Ruiz )
"People have dating (overload) — they're on Tinder, Match, OKCupid," said Talia Goldstein, co-founder and CEO of Three Day Rule, Match.com's "white glove" matchmaking partner. "I think people are getting so confused by all the options that they are looking for someone to help them."
While no data tracks the growth of the human matchmaking trade, Paul Oyer, a Stanford University business school professor, said he wouldn't be surprised if it is on the upswing. As income inequality deepens, there are more well-off people who can afford personalized services, from day care to dog care to date-arranging, he said.
These love emissaries could hurt for business if online dating sites improve their matching algorithms or figure out how to prevent members from lying about their height and age, as the Web will always offer a bigger pool, said Oyer, author of "Everything I Ever Needed to Know about Economics I Learned from Online Dating."
For now, though, matchmakers are banking on people paying a premium for thoughtful romantic curating.

Three Day Rule, which launched in Chicago this year, charges men and women $3,500 for three months of personal matchmaking and $5,000 for a six-month package that includes date coaching, styling and professional photography to help clients present their most attractive selves.
Founded in 2010 in Los Angeles and also serving San Francisco and New York, the company plans to expand to Washington, D.C., and Boston this fall and an additional 20 cities next year, thanks to funding from Match, Goldstein said.
Goldstein, who worked as a segment producer for E! True Hollywood Stories before starting the company, said the service gets 40 to 50 new paying clients each month, and has a database of about 30,000 singles that matchmakers scour to find the best candidates for their clients. (It is free to join the database, which is not viewable to anyone but the matchmakers.)
At first, 70 percent of clients were women, she said, though now it is closer to 50-50.
"I think women are working really hard and want someone to do the (dating) work for them," Goldstein said of the heavy interest from women. "It's like outsourcing your love life."
Some matchmakers say their clientele is getting younger, a sort of retro backlash against the immediacy of the Tinder era (Tinder, for the uninitiated, is a popular dating app based almost entirely on photos).
Stef Safran, founder of the 5-year-old Chicago matchmaking service Stef and the City, said she has noticed an uptick in 20-something clients who tell her they are tired of the casual nature of many dating websites, wary of misleading photos or overwhelmed by the magnitude of profiles they must pick from and compete with.
"They don't want to go out with three different people a week," Safran said.

These young clients aren't necessarily on the hunt for a spouse, she said, as is the classic purpose of matchmakers, but they do want a better dating experience. She has two price structures to accommodate her disproportionately female clientele. Men pay $2,400 for at least six guaranteed dates, and women pay $50 to $175 per date as matches become available, depending on how picky they are.
Leslie Wardman, co-founder of Ambiance Matchmaking, which is based in Chicago and has offices in Oklahoma, said most of her clients were 40-somethings in transition after divorce when she started the company 14 years ago. But recently more men and women in their 20s and 30s have been signing up to get set up.
"They are more sophisticated and savvy and have less time to focus on themselves," she said.
On a recent afternoon in a 47th-floor downtown conference room with sweeping views of skyscrapers and the lake, Wardman interviewed a 27-year-old real estate agent who lives in Lincoln Park.
"What did your father do? ... How do you spend time on weekends? ... What did you like about your last boyfriend? ... What did you not like about him? ... What's your greatest goal in life?" Wardman asked as she jotted notes on a clipboard.
The client, who declined to be identified for in this article, signed on with Ambiance on the recommendation of one of her real estate clients. While she said she has no trouble meeting men, she struggles to pinpoint the right ones without wasting time or causing heartache, and she likes the idea of getting help from an ally with her best interests in mind.
Wardman, whose standard fee is $3,995 per year — though she gives discounted rates to certain clients — said the company is picky about who it accepts, and is particularly strict about education. Ninety-five percent of her clients have college degrees and 70 percent have advanced degrees, she said.
Wardman typically matches clients with one another, based on a variety of factors, including how they were raised, the energy they exude, and whether they look good together — although, as a policy, she doesn't share photos before setting up a date.
"We don't promise love and marriage, but we promise that they will have a lot in common with this person," Wardman said.
Business models among matchmakers vary widely.
On the high end, Chicago-based Selective Search, a prominent service founded in 2000 by executive recruiter Barbie Adler, charges rates starting at $25,000. Ninety percent of the clients are men, who are matched with dates who do not pay for the service, though over the past three to five years the company has seen a rise in high-net-worth female clients.
On the other end is Project Fixup, a Chicago-based TechStar startup that charges $20 per setup, using digital tools that have helped bring a human touch to the masses.
Founded two years and bootstrapped with $118,000, Project Fixup employs a human "fixup specialist" who picks through search results after a client questionnaire is run through an algorithm, matching members based on stated deal-breakers, feedback from past dates and an "attractiveness tier." The specialist also arranges all of the details the date – time, location, venue – so no one lifts a finger.
Technology has expanded the toolbox of the modern matchmaker. At Three Day Rule, clients are asked to send photos of their exes, and if it appears the client has a certain physical "type," facial recognition software helps find matches in the database who look similar, Goldstein said.

To Chipotle  With Love6
My husband and I had a contractor rip out the carpet and create the same look in our condo before we moved in last year. We didn't know this in advance, but while on the job, our contractor boasted that he had installed the concrete in some area Chipotles.
And Wednesday, the Chipotle where I ate lunch was playing music by my favorite band, the Mexican acoustic guitar duo, Rodrigo y Gabriela.
Yes, if I'm caught in an airport or driving down Interstate 65 at night, McDonald's may be the only place with the lights on. And yes, I'm going to stop at one when the alternative is a gas station.
But I'm going to order oatmeal. McDonald's has excellent oatmeal. I think it's better than Starbucks' oatmeal. Now that I think about it, I'm worried that's because it has more sugar.
Let's see.
Ugh. 32 grams of sugar. 32!
That's more than a person is supposed to have in an entire day. A can of Coke has 39 grams.
Apparently, thanks to Google, I just learned you can order McDonald's oatmeal without the brown sugar. Who knew? McDonald's, let your customers know when they have options.
Now, the only problem with Chipotle is that at 12:06 p.m. Wednesday, I counted 41 people in line at the 316 N. Michigan Ave. location.
I got there early because, as a regular, I know that the line starts snaking closer to the door around 11:45 a.m.
I'm not going to wait outside for Chipotle.
But I'm not going to run to the McDonald's across the street, either.

More health insurance changes on the wayMore health insurance changes on the way
High deductibles on the rise

Affordable Care Act has employers pushing higher deductibles, lower premiums
Benefits experts: It's time to break out the calculator and rethink health insurance
Employers are increasingly pushing enrollment in high-deductible, low-premium health insurance plans, according to benefits experts, which means it might be time to break out the calculator and reconsider current policies.
Employees in Chicago and across the country are getting their first looks at what they will be paying for health insurance in 2015 with the start of open enrollment, the annual window in which workers can make changes to their elected benefits, including health insurance. Open enrollment is typically held in October and November each year.
"Don't assume that nothing's changing even if your current option is still available," said Craig Rosenberg, practice leader of health and welfare benefits at consulting firm Aon Hewitt. "There are probably some new choices that are available for you."
CHART: Consumer-directed health plans on the rise
Three-fourths of employers aim to offer high-deductible plans coupled with a health savings account in the next three years, and 20 percent will only offer those type of plans, according to data from Mercer, a financial services company with a health and benefits arm. To qualify for a health savings account, a plan has to have a minimum deductible of $1,250 for employee-only coverage and $2,500 for family coverage. Others are offering private health exchanges, which give employees several options for coverage.
8
Overall costs likely will rise again in 2015, by about 4 percent, according to Mercer, modest compared with previous years. But some employees are seeing much sharper increases, making high-deductible plans more attractive. Consumers who opt not to obtain coverage, either through their employer or through the federal Affordable Care Act, will also pay more. Those individuals will pay a greater penalty for not securing coverage, increasing to $325, or 2 percent of household income, whichever fee is greater, from $95 this year, or 1 percent of yearly household income.
High-deductible, low-premium plans are often called consumer-directed health plans and paired with a health savings account that allows workers to pay for eligible expenses with tax-free dollars, experts said.
Employers have a financial incentive to offer such plans. Under the Affordable Care Act, employers in 2018 that offer plans that cost more than $10,200 for an individual or $27,500 for a family will be charged a 40 percent tax on the amount exceeding the threshold. By raising deductibles and lowering premiums, companies will lower their chance of triggering the tax.
Beth Umland, director of research for health and benefits for Mercer, said more than one-third of companies would hit that excise tax threshold if they made no changes to their plan offerings.
Premiums in consumer directed plans typically cost about 20 percent less than a traditional PPO or HMO plan, she said.
"If you've been scared off of consumer directed plans, this might be the year to man-up and take a look," Umland said. "Employers want to get people into those plans for a variety of reasons. That's the plan where they see long-term cost control, so to get folks to join it, it's bargain basement premium contributions."
Nancy Coletto, a Chicago-based partner in Mercer's health and benefits practice, said employer health insurance plans are more likely to add an additional fee for dependents (spouses and adult children) who have access to health insurance at another workplace this year.
"Health care reform puts more responsibility on employers to cover more of their employees," Coletto said. "Employers who are now covering more employees may make it more expensive to cover a dependent. Make sure you fully understand what costs are changing. That decision may be different than what it was before."
Thanks to all the Democrats that voted for Obama care. my deductible tripled, higher, premiums, still waiting for that $2500 savings....

GRAPHIC: Fixing Social SecurityGET THERE
How would you fix Social Security?
EXCERPTED AND ADAPTED FROM "THE SOCIAL SECURITY FIX-IT BOOK," FROM THE CENTER FOR RETIREMENT RESEARCH AT BOSTON COLLEGE. ILLUSTRATIONS BY MELINDA BECK
The Problem
ocial Security provides 70 percent of the income of households led by someone age 80 or over. But the program has a financing problem. As the remaining Baby Boomers reach retirement age, current Social Security taxes — or payroll taxes — are unable to keep up with benefits owed.  The good news is that there are potential solutions. With help from the Center for Retirement Research, we'll explain a mix of most frequently mentioned solutions here and ask you to come up with your own solution in our survey below. Read related article.
How the shortfall will happen
When there aren't enough workers to fund the benefits it is paying out, Social Security dips into the money the Social Security Trust Fund has accumulated over time. In 2033, that extra source of revenue for the program will be gone, meaning the program will only be able to pay 77 cents of every dollar.
2010
The benefits being paid by Social Security outpaced the money coming in from payroll taxes. To maintain full benefits, the program started using interest from bonds in the Social Security Trust Fund.
2020
The Trust Fund interest will not be enough to pay out full benefits. This means the program will have to start selling the bonds in the Trust Fund.
2033
The Trust Fund will be depleted. Social Security will then be able to pay only 77 cents on the dollar. And the shortfall slowly widens thereafter.
Your turn to help find a solution
The common solutions for solving the Social Security shortfall generally fall into two camps: cut benefits or raise revenue. In the end, fixing the program may involve a little of both. What changes would you make to improve Social Security? Click through to explore the solutions and make your picks — and see how they compare with those of other readers.

How benefits could be cut
Benefit cuts lower incomes in retirement and generally hit low earners, the disabled and the oldest the hardest.
How revenue could be raised
Initiatives that raise revenue primarily lower incomes during our working years and primarily hit those with higher incomes.

Ray Clark showed its never too late to improve your fitnessBy Lenny Bernstein October 27 Follow @LennyMBernstein
We toss around the word "inspiration" quite casually, but when someone truly earns the description, it's worth stopping for a moment to mention it. I met Ray Clark only twice, but both times he sent me back to my exercise routine with renewed determination to take care of myself. What's more, I know many other people had the same reaction.
(Bill Leary/The Washington Post)
Clark is a fellow from Gaithersburg who I wrote about in 2013. At the time he was 102, but still working out once a week with the help of his then-70-year-old trainer, Thom Hunter, who has a mild form of Parkinson's disease. Clark hit the gym for the first time at 98 after the deaths of his wife and daughter.
During those half-hour sessions, I watched him curl 40 pounds, exercise vigorously on a rowing machine and pluck bouncing eight-pound kettle bells from the air. He did 10 reps with 60 pounds on the “pullover” machine and moved 60 pounds 10 times on the “seated row” apparatus. He did modified pushups and pullups.
A year later, I checked in on Clark, and he was doing much of the workout at 103 . At 148, he weighed three pounds less than he did a year earlier.
Clark died Oct. 5 of congestive heart failure, having touched my life and earning the respect of many people who read my stories about him. They left notes of admiration for him on our Web site.
"Way to go, Ray!," one person wrote in a comment that was typical of many others. "A true inspiration for the young, the old, and everyone in between...You rock!"
Clark's son and daughter-in-law, Dennis and Joan Clark, who had encouraged him to begin working out, told me in an e-mail that Clark "died quickly and, from what we could observe, painlessly. His final day was spent with his grandson in the morning and his granddaughter in the evening, until we got home. In retrospect they were honored to spend the last day with him."
Clark, they said, "was most proud of the fact that he made a difference and helped people he never met."

How Ordering Food Online Is Making You FatWhether it's newcomers like Seamless and grubHub or veterans like Apple and Starbucks, companies of all sorts are making it easier than ever to order and pay with as little human interaction as possible.
That might be convenient and faster, but it’s not great for our health.
Ordering food online from restaurants causes people to do two unhealthy things: order more food and choose items that are higher in calories. In fact, a 2012 study centered around a North Carolina pizza restaurant found that total calories in online orders were about 6 percent higher than phone orders. That came out to about 100 calories more per order, according to Ryan McDevitt, an assistant professor at Duke University Fuqua School Of Business and the author of the study.

So why do we order with more reckless abandon when we're using our smartphones and laptops? McDevitt said these barriers to human interaction essentially also act as barriers to shame. If there’s no waiter, there’s no other person to make them feel guilty for making less-sensible choices.
“There’s no social interaction [when ordering online] like there is at a restaurant, or even on the phone,” McDevitt told The Huffington Post. “No one’s judging [the customer] implicitly, even if it’s just the waiter at the restaurant. If that social force isn’t in play, you might change the way you act.”
Other recent research backs up the idea that we act differently when separated from the world by a screen. One study, for example, found that patients were more likely to admit to binge drinking over text message than they were over the phone. Alone, we can be more honest with ourselves about who we are and what we want. When it comes to admitting to drunk driving, that's a good thing. When you're choosing between fries and a salad, not so much.
Ordering online is not exactly new -- Pizza Hut claims to have taken the first web-based order back in 1994 -- but with the rise of the app economy and online ordering platforms like Seamless and GrubHub, its popularity has grown. GrubHub alone has seen its number of regular users grow by 50 percent, to 4.6 million, in the past year . And with new corporate inventions coming out all the time, it could “get worse well before it gets better,” as McDevitt put it.
Chili’s, for example, has set up touchscreen tablets in roughly 1,000 restaurants across the country. And yes, Chili's told HuffPost in an email that guests using the tablets "typically order more," especially when it comes to dessert.
Touch screens not only let customers order more easily they also allow restaurants to promote specific menu items.
Domino's has come to a similar conclusion about customers' preference for ordering. Domino's didn't respond to an email from HuffPost, but now some 40 percent of Domino’s U.S. customers order online, according to recent figures reported by Bloomberg.
“We look at surveys of our customers, and they’re pretty clear in telling us they like ordering on digital better than talking on the telephone,” Domino’s chief financial officer Michael Lawton was quoted by Bloomberg as saying .

Starbucks also looks to be trying to cash in on the phenomenon with its recently released order-ahead smartphone app . The app allows customers to place their orders before even arriving at the store. Now, rather than dealing with that disapproving look from your barista when you say you'd like some whipped cream, you can just order it up on your phone.
But eating more could just be a side effect of spending more. Apple's new mobile payment platform that allows customers to make purchases with the tap of their iPhone, known as Apple Pay, allows customers to spend much more easily. Instead of being used for a simple pizza joint, the platform is taking the phenomenon across industries. As HuffPost's Ben Walsh pointed out, the ease of the platform encourages what researchers call "decoupling," that is spending without thinking, which can't be good for our health or bank accounts.
But McDevitt said there’s another way that ordering on-screen, specifically with a smartphone or tablet, can be detrimental. Unlike desktops, smartphones and tablets offer limited space and may contribute to a customer being less thorough about exploring the menu, especially when it's through a restaurant’s own app. The room that is available can instead be used by the restaurant to push deals that feature less-healthy food upon the customer.

The Domino's mobile app, for example, offers a plain "Build your own pizza" option, before offering more exotic and expensive options like "Artisan," "American Legend" and "Feast" pizzas.
“I can see a place like Domino’s pinging you with what they think you should order,” McDevitt said. “It’s clearly in their interest to get you to order more stuff so they’re going to be focused on getting you the less healthy choices.”

Autumn surge in area home listings brings optimism0
Other benefits of putting a house on the market now? Real estate agents note that a home has an easier time shining, compared with the rush of newly listed properties in the early spring. In April and May, more than 19,000 new listings came online in the Chicago area, according to Midwest Real Estate Data. Also, sellers have two seasons' worth of comparable sales prices to look at when they set their list prices.
How do these fall listings change the tenor of the market this year? Typically, buyers feel they're in control as the year winds down, that sellers would only put their home on the market because they're desperate to sell and that will allow a bidder to come in with a low offer.
This year, that may not be the case."Sellers don't feel desperate at all," said Cynthia Tobisch, a realty agent at Redfin.
What does hold true though, and sellers should keep this in mind, is that buyers looking for properties are serious. They aren't looking at houses just to look at them. And if they find one they like, they pounce and want to close before the holidays.
"The pool of buyers you're chasing is less but the quality is so much better," said Robert Wisdom, an agent with Re/Max Horizon. "These are people who want to purchase a home right now. We are riding a little wave in terms of the amount of inquiries coming in."
That means serious sellers shouldn't spend too much time testing the market with a too-high list price. They also shouldn't think they can get away with not properly preparing a house for sale.
Some sellers and their agents who are in a rush to list homes have posted photos on real estate sites that are textbook cases of what not to do, listings with poorly lit photos and unkempt rooms with far too much stuff.
"The way we shop for real estate now, it's like everything else," said Jeanne Jordan, an agent at J.W. Reedy Realty. "It's pictures and tours. No one wants to look at pictures of a dirty bathroom with a hair dryer and an open toilet."
Real estate agents also say they already are hearing from homeowners who are interested in putting their homes on the market in early 2015, and want to start preparing their properties. That work can help with a better sales price next year.
"First impressions are everything," said @properties agent Andrew Forster. "These buyers still want everything. You get a lot of brand-new buyers, second-home buyers who are moving from the city with the two-bedroom, two-bath new (condo). A brand-new two-bedroom, two-bath shows a little differently than a 60-year-old Colonial."

Overbought vs. Oversold: What s the DifferenceFriday, 24 Oct 2014 | 10:00  AM ET
CNBC.com
SHARES
Explaining overbought & oversold
Overbought means that the demand for a certain asset pushes the price of an underlying asset upward. Oversold, is when the price of an asset falls sharply. Gary Kaminsky explains.
Recent volatility in the stock market that caused short-term price extremes has made it important for investors to understand the difference between overbought and oversold.
Just to be clear, oversold is the exact opposite of overbought.
Overbought is a situation in which the demand for a certain asset unjustifiably pushes the price of an underlying asset to levels that do not support certain fundamentals. It happens when an asset that has experienced sharp upward movements over a very short period of time is often deemed to be overbought. Actually determining the degree in which an asset is overbought is very subjective and can differ between investors.
Oversold, on the other hand, is when the price of an underlying asset has fallen sharply, and to a level below where its true value resides. This usually occurs as a result of market overreaction or panic selling.
In this case, assets that have experienced sharp declines over a brief period of time are often deemed to be oversold.
Gary Kaminsky, Morgan Stanley's vice chairman of wealth management, explains.

How you would fix Social Security: Sooner rather than laterBy Jonnelle Marte October 29 Follow @jonnelle
(Illustration by Melinda Beck)
About a month ago, the Post invited readers to chime in on what they thought were the best ways to  fix Social Security . 
With the help of the  Center for Retirement Research , we presented an array of 12 solutions commonly suggested for the retirement system, which is projected to be so depleted that it will be unable to pay full benefits by 2033.  Then we asked readers to pick the options they would consider.
 
This week we’re reporting on the solutions that have resonated with the most readers. We’re tallying the results we’ve seen so far, but you can still  check out the graphic  and choose the solutions you think would work best. 
One thing was clear from the first month’s responses to our question about how to fix Social Security: Readers want something to get done.
Only 2 percent of responses were in favor of “doing nothing,” which would mean that after 2033 –when the Social Security trust fund is expected to be depleted– retirement benefits would be cut by 23 percent. And only 3 percent of responses said it would be a good idea to put off raising taxes until after the trust fund is depleted, at which point a steep tax hike would be needed to pay benefits.
“People recognize the problem and that something needs to be done,” says Catherine Collinson, president of the nonprofit TransAmerica Center for Retirement Studies, which conducted a survey earlier this year that reached a similar conclusion.
Only 9 percent of the people surveyed by the center said they would do nothing to reform Social Security. Close to a third, or 28 percent, said they wanted to increase taxes. Fourteen percent said they wanted to cut benefits and another 28 percent said they favored a more balanced approach.
Still, anyone watching the program inch closer and closer to its long-expected funding shortfall might say they’d be happy to see lawmakers take any approach. Social Security hasn’t been changed substantially since 1983, the last time the trust fund was close to zero.
And it’s not looking like lawmakers will have reason to take action any time soon– or at least not for a couple of years. Some analysts think Congress will consider reforming the program in two years when the Social Security disability trust fund is expected to be depleted, leading to a 20 percent cut in disability benefits.
“Historically, you would simply transfer from Social Security, basically kick the can down the road,” says William Hoagland, a senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank based in Washington. “We don’t think that’s going to be as easy this time around.”
There are already some efforts underway. In May, Reps. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) and John Delaney (D-Md.) introduced a bill that would create a bipartisan commission to improve Social Security. And the Bipartisan Policy Center, launched a commission in the spring that will create a list of policy recommendations for improving retirement security, including Social Security. Still, it’s not clear if and when those recommendations might lead to change.
By basically rejecting the solutions that called for “passing the problem off to the next generation,” readers suggested that they want to improve Social Security not just for themselves, but for their children and grandchildren. “They would much rather see Congress take action now,” says David Brown, senior policy advisor for the Economic Program at Third Way, a centrist think tank based in Washington.
Readers also seem to support a more balanced approach. For a program that typically divides voters and politicians into two camps, (Raise taxes! Cut benefits!) readers seemed to favor a little bit of each.
Instead, Congress is giving them the exact opposite of what they want: nothing at all.

Data Breaches Bah  Humbug! We re Going to ShopEmail
After the data breach heard 'round the world hit Target last year, will  shoppers behave any differently this Christmas?
According to a new study by Deloitte, although 42 percent of consumers said  they are concerned about their personal data when making in-store purchases, 56  percent will still shop this holiday at retailers that have experienced a data  breach.
The research follows similar findings in a report from CreditCards.com released  earlier this month, which found that 52 percent of major credit and debit card  holders either "probably" or "definitely" would shop at a store where shoppers'  personal information had been exposed.

According to a new study, although 42 percent of consumers said they are concerned about their personal data when making in-store purchases, 56 percent will still shop this holiday at retailers that have experienced a data breach.
That's good news for such retailers as Target, Home Depot , Kmart and Michaels , which have fallen  victim to data breaches over the past year.
"The consumer's now somewhat desensitized [to breaches]," said Rod Sides,  principal at Deloitte Consulting.

This is particularly true among higher-income households, according to the  CreditCards.com report. It found that only 31 percent of households earning  $75,000 or more annually said they were likely to avoid affected stores,  compared with 56 percent of those with an annual income of less than $30,000.
Breaches are also more likely to weigh on older shoppers, a study by The  National Retail Federation found.
Video: Some UPS customers may have had their credit and debit card information exposed by a computer virus.
"The younger you are, the more likely you were to grow up with technology, so  it's part of your world," said Pam Goodfellow, principal analyst at Prosper  Insights & Analytics, which conducted NRF's holiday spending survey.
The biggest shift, Sides predicted, is likely to come from consumers' method  of payment . Backing up that theory, the NRF study found that about one-fifth of  shoppers are "somewhat" or "very likely" to let the breaches affect how they  shop or pay for merchandise. 
More gifts under the tree
With consumers starting to feel more optimistic about the economy, Deloitte's  survey, which polled more than 5,000 consumers, found that total spending is  projected to rise 13 percent, to $1,299, per household.
Gifts, in particular, are expected to get a big boost, with Deloitte  predicting spending in this category will rise 9 percent to $458. It's also  anticipating the biggest year-over-year increase in the total number of gifts  that people purchase since 2006-2007. The firm expects the average person will  buy about 13 gifts, which despite the gain is still significantly lower than  2007's average of about 23.
Deloitte also predicts non-gift purchases will increase 6 percent to $144.  This includes the practice of self-gifting, when shoppers pick up an item or two  for themselves when they are out looking for presents. The results contrast  NRF's findings, which said that spending on self-gifting is expected to  decline from an average $134.77 in 2013, to $126.68.
"I think folks are starting to splurge a little bit more," Sides  said.
Webrooming vs. Showrooming
And increasingly, they're doing so online. While 55 percent of respondents  said they will shop at malls this year, more than one-quarter said they will  shop there less this year. Along those lines, the Internet once again came in as  the top place where consumers expect to shop.
Video: Use helpful apps to get price alerts as prices drop on watched items, and keep coupons at your fingertips for fast savings. TODAY’s digital lifestyle correspondent Mario Armstrong reports.
That doesn't mean you should count out the store. As consumers have come to  expect retailers to meet their needs wherever and whenever they want,  webrooming—the practice of browsing online and then buying in store—is expected  to outpace showrooming—the idea of looking first in store and then buying  online.
While 68 percent of shoppers plan to webroom, only about half expect to  showroom, according to Deloitte. Although this will likely cause a larger dent  in foot traffic, and limit the chance of impulse purchases, it should lead to  higher conversion rates—in other words, when customers are in the store, they  will likely buy something. 
"With pre-shopping available through technology 24 hours a day,  retailers can expect a 'ready to buy' shopper entering their store this holiday  season," a recent report from ShopperTrak said.
Read More Has the 'funk' passed?  Retail giving mixed signals
For those who aren't ready to buy, they'll have no problem whipping out their  smartphone to help them decide. According to CFI Group, 57 percent of consumers  use their smartphones while they're shopping in stores. But somewhat  surprisingly, they also rely on good old fashioned communication. According to  Deloitte, 48 percent of respondents said that knowledgeable store associates  make them more likely to purchase from a particular retailer.
"It was a little bit of a surprise," Sides said, but he added that it's part  of the edge that physical stores have over the Web.
"It's service, it's experience and it's something unique," he  said.

Nasscom Says 11 500 Start-Ups to Come Up in India by 2020Indian Realty Market Sees $4.5 Billion Investment During January-September: CBRE
Bangalore: As many as 11,500 start-ups would come up in the country employing over 2,50,000 people by 2020, key findings of a report by industry body Nasscom showed.
Unveiling the findings of the India Start-up Report 2014 here on Wednesday, Nasscom president R Chandrashekhar said 300 VC/PE (venture capital and private equity) and 225 angel investments deals amounting to over $2 billion have been made in India.
He said over 20 mergers and acquisitions worth $1 billion were done in last three years.
As many as 3,100 start-ups are present in India, which is the third largest base in the world, he said. Also, 800 plus start-ups are being set up annually, he told reporters at the eleventh edition of Nasscom's annual flagship Product Conclave here.
Earlier, the industry body launched its three-day annual flagship Nasscom Product Conclave 2014.
The conclave builds on the fast growing product and start-up ecosystem in the country and provides a platform to engage with thought leaders in the product space and discuss issues of common interest, Mr Chandrashekhar said.

Father of 8 explains why he hasnt saved for his kids college educationBy Jonnelle Marte October 28 Follow @jonnelle

David T. Fagan has eight kids and his oldest daughter is a senior in high school–and he hasn’t saved a penny for his children’s college education. But Fagan isn’t stressing. In fact, Fagan says he would prefer it if his children didn’t go to college at all.
Fagan and his wife lay out their parenting philosophy in new book Guerrilla Parenting , scheduled to be released in January, and say they encourage their children to strike out on their own and create businesses from the time they’re in elementary school. If the children are set on going to college — and their oldest is– Fagan says he expects his children to work, save up and earn scholarships. Or at the very least, they need to make a good case for how they’re going to use the degree to land a job and avoid ending up back on his couch.
Fagan, a marketing executive who lives in Orange County, Calif. with his wife, kids and two dogs, recently spoke with The Washington Post about the pros and cons of a college education and how he and his wife start teaching their children about money from the moment they start walking.
The conversation below has been edited for length and clarity.
Tell me about your family.
I’m the oldest of six kids and I grew up in a home where if I wanted anything my parents told me hey you have to go work for it. I actually left high school in 11th grade. Later on I did do a little bit of college, but never graduated. That carried over to when I had kids. You know, wanting them to have a customized education. Not so much about college and degrees. I think there’s a lot of wasted time there.
I think there’s are a lot of people out there who are not cut out for college. I’m raising my kids knowing that each one of them is different and that each one of them needs a little bit of an experience. A lot of my kids, they go to public school but I’ve taken my kids out of school before.
They’ve been home schooled at different times but for the most part they’re all in public schools. My oldest is 17, my youngest is two. It makes things interesting to say the least.

When you decided to leave school, was it because you wanted to start working?
I was just very independent and that’s maybe one of the downsides of having too much independence. Because my parents always had me do so much things and make money, by the time I was in 11th grade, I was bored. I wanted to experience things. I wanted to work and make money and be on my own.
I think I made my life harder than it needed to be at that age but out of that came me learning what my strengths were and learning what my weaknesses were and learning how to make money. I didn’t have a college education and I also looked really young so I had to learn how to communicate with people.
I moved from a small town in Oregon to California. I sold an electronics company into hiring me to sell electronics. Cell phones were just starting to get big and computers were also starting to get big so I sold computers. They usually didn’t hire people till they turned 18. I was 17 so I had to sell them on that.
I wanted to work, I wanted to make money. I wanted to be independent. I wanted to go out and do things.  But I think that’s kind of part of the problem and where a lot of teens fall short today. They’re starting to have their own dreams and ideas and instead of those things being fostered and experimented with, they’re being squashed and thrown to the side.
And unfortunately by the time they’re given that chance they have responsibilities and they have issues and they have other things going on. They have good habits and they have bad habits. All of a sudden life gets in the way and now it’s really hard. So I think early on they really need to experiment and to try things.
Are you trying to say that an education is important but if you don’t have an experience or a good work ethic, an education won’t go as far?
Mark Twain had a famous quote, “I have never let schooling interfere with my education.” And I just love that quote because it’s so true. There’s just so many things that can’t be done in the classroom. There’s so many things about the school system that are broken. That’s not news to anybody it’s just nobody’s brave enough to do something different.
So, what I’ve done with my own kids is my oldest was in first and second grade and I pulled her out of school because she just wasn’t doing very well and the teacher didn’t know what to do. So I brought her to the office with me. I gave her things to do.
Then she went back into school all the way back until the 7th grade and then in the 7th grade she was starting to do some different business stuff that I was helping her with, and other parents were saying, “Hey, how does your daughter do this or how does this work? And how does she earn all this money?” So I pulled her back out of school and started taking her on the road. I do a lot of speaking and presenting so I started taking her to conventions with me and I actually put her on stage. And I was like, “Hey you potential entrepreneurs out there, if I can teach a 12 year old girl how to do this you can do this. If I can teach a 12-year-old to start a business, you can start a business.”
So I helped her write a book and do some other things and gave her a lot of real world experience. But then in the 8th grade she went back to school and she probably had seen a little too much of the real world at a young age. Then her sophomore year we took her out of school again because she was having so many opportunities.
So she did a huge internship program with my office in Beverly Hills, and she did more traveling and she started a business called hireateentoday.com, which is a virtual assistant company made out of teenagers. Then in the 11th grade she wanted to date, she wanted to spend time with her friends.
She just wanted to be young. So she went back to school in the 11th grade and now she’s just getting ready to start the 12th grade and graduate and figure out what she wants to do next.
So much is customizing things. I think I do have some advantages that some parents don’t because I do have the ability to teach, I do have the ability to put them in different environments. But I think that’s stuff that other people can do too and that’s what we want to teach them too through this Guerrilla Parenting book.
How can children start making money when they’re young?
I’m big on teaching power plays. A power play to me is something you can do really quickly that will make you money. I’m always teaching people about proof of concept– getting things to market quickly.
One of the things my daughter, who just turned 13, will do to get money, she’ll go into an office complex and she’ll say, “I’m bringing in enchiladas tomorrow. Who wants some?” In an afternoon, she’ll sell 30 to 40 products.
She’ll do that in 24 hours and she’ll make herself a couple hundred bucks. She’s really good at sales, and that’s what I’m seeing specifically the potential in her. School is not going to teach her what I think she needs to learn next to develop those talents so I want to help her do that.
Related: How to pass money on to your children
How early do you start teaching your kids about the concept of money and how it’s made?
Very early. But it’s not so much about just money. It’s really a mindset. And I find the mindset is really about teaching kids if you want something, figure it out and then show them how to get it. So the mindset starts at a year-and a half, two years old.
If I’m at a store or if we’re at a restaurant, I’ll ask them, “What do you want?” And they’ll say, “I want to order this.” “Well you tell the waitress, you tell the person at the counter.” And that may sound really silly but some kids are really shy. And if my kids won’t ask for it, they won’t get it. So just getting them in the mindset of what do you want and what are you willing to do to get it, even if maybe it makes you feel a little uncomfortable.
That is the biggest problem with our society right now. You very rarely see two or three generations of success in a row because that one person gets the success and what do they say? They say, “I never want my kid to go through what I went through.” When what they went through was exactly what made them a success.
Related: It turns out millennials are actually really good at saving
So what do they do? “I’m going to send you to the best school. I’m going to send you to the best college. I’m going to give you this, I’m going to give you that. I’m going to give you all the things I never had” –without them ever having to work for it. And so by giving them things they’re kind of condemning them to a life of mediocrity.
That’s what I’m trying to show people. Help your kids figure out what they want and then make them do their part to get it.
Walk me through the rules of the house. If one of your kids wants to go to college, who pays for it?
My kids all know that if they want to go to college they’ve got to pay for it. They also know I’m a deal maker and negotiator and when the time comes they can pitch me whatever they want to pitch me. But the rules are I’m not paying for anybody’s college. I might pay for an individual class that they might sell me on or whatever. But I’m just not a believer.
You can ask anyone of my kids. “Is your dad going to pay for college? No.”
So what are you going to do? You’d better get a scholarship, you’d better get good grades. I think we’re putting the emphasis on the wrong thing. The emphasis is on “you’ve got to go to college.” The emphasis should be on, “You’ve got to become self-reliant. You’ve got to take care of yourself.”
I use this one Venn Diagram a lot where three circles all overlap in the middle. One circle is everything you love to do. Make another list of everything you know how to do what you’re good at doing. And then the other circle is, what are the things people will pay you to do? And where that overlaps in the middle. that’s the sweet spot. That’s where total success is at.
So I’m more concerned with the journey of helping my kids figure out what that looks like. What do they love, what are they good at, and who will pay them the most money for those things?
College might help you learn what you love, college might help you learn all three of those areas. But it’s a method. It’s a process. It’s a tool, it’s a resource. It’s not the destination. Too many people go to college as if that is the finish line. And that’s why you see all these people sleeping on their parents’ couches.
Related: How much do you need to make to afford your student loans?
I have friends who are attorneys and things like that they basically say “David I was just told that when I graduated I would turn into money, I would be instantly rich. But you know, here I am now. I’m an attorney, and there’s a ton of attorneys and now I have to learn business.” So all the focus is on the wrong thing.
So many groups are trying to raise awareness to the fact that an education alone does not lead to success and many employers emphasize work experience. But the numbers still show that the people who have college degrees earn more on average than people who don’t. So how do you balance that?
Ask yourself this: Who are the people who make the most money overall? What are the careers? Sales people. Entrepreneurs. Maybe only 10 percent to 20 percent of those sales people or entrepreneurs are really doing well but that 10 to 20 percent of those people are drastically slanting the numbers against anything else. And I would even go as far as saying that again, are we asking the right question? You’re saying, “who is making the most money?” But money doesn’t equal happiness.
People aren’t defining happiness by the second home, the boat, the fancy corner office. The fancy title. More and more people are starting to value experiences and stability to make a decent living. To have friends. To travel, to have a hobby. To be able to have a vacation, to be able to have a balanced life. We don’t care so much about the savings account, which maybe is a problem that is going to come back to bite us. But we want to enjoy life now. We don’t want to put off our dreams till later because we don’t know if there’s going to be a tomorrow. There used to be more stability in the marketplace.
It used to be “I’m going to go to get a college education and go work for a company because it’s more stable.” But it’s not anymore. Companies are going out of business all the time. Companies merge all the time. Companies are sending jobs overseas all the time.
It may still be that college kids and corporations are the safer thing but that’s changing. It’s changing fast. I think it’s going to keep changing so if you want happiness and self-reliance then learn how to monetize your knowledge and your experiences and learn how to live a life by your own design.
So if your children do decide they do want to save money to go to college, how are you advising them to do that?
My second oldest daughter Taylor, who is 15, is perfect for college. She is saving a little bit. She’s a 4.0 student. She’s won awards for being a student athlete. I believe that she is one of those people that she is designed for school. She should go to college. She probably will become an attorney or something like that. But even then I’m going to say “okay now you have a law degree, open up your own practice but don’t go to work for someone else. Or go work for someone else for a while and then open up your own practice so you can be in control of your own destiny.”
But I wouldn’t be surprised if she graduated high school, went to college, got married, had kids. Maybe did something else on the side. But lived life totally happy, totally content and totally by design even though education played a big role in it.

RBI Allows Urban Cooperative Banks to Act as PAN Service Agents
Press Trust of India | Updated On: October 29, 2014 22:07 (IST)
Indian Realty Market Sees $4.5 Billion Investment During January-September: CBRE
Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has allowed all urban cooperative banks (UCBs) to act as PAN service agents.
Earlier, only financially sound and well-managed UCBs were allowed to act as PAN service agents. They were allowed to do so only after entering a tie-up with UTI Infrastructure and Technology Services Ltd (UTIITSL), NSDL e- Governance Infrastructure Ltd or with an agency authorised by Income Tax Department.
"With a view to expanding the scope of fee-based services offered by UCBs, it has now been decided to permit all UCBs to act as PAN Service Agent (PSA) by entering into a tie-up with any agency authorised by Income Tax Department," the RBI said in a notification.
As per RBI rules, financially-sound UCBs should have a maintenance of a minimum CRAR (Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets Ratio) of 10 per cent on a continuous basis.
Their gross NPAs (non-performing assets) should be less than 7 per cent and net NPAs or bad loans should not exceed 3 per cent.
Also, there should not be any default in maintenance of CRR/SLR (cash reserve ratio/statutory liquidity ratio) during the preceding financial year; should have a continuous net profit for the last three years and sound internal control system with at least two professional directors on the board.

Five Ways Tech Companies Can Be More Family Friendlyreddit
It's no secret -- women aren't entering and advancing in the tech industry at nearly the same rates as men. While there are many factors that contribute to tech's gender disparity, we know that employees with family responsibilities face a unique and significant set of barriers. We also know that the burden of balancing work and family responsibilities falls disproportionately on women. A 2012 study of Silicon Valley tech companies found that women in the industry are four times less likely than men to have a partner who takes on primary household and caregiving responsibilities.
In honor of National Work and Family Month, the following are five suggestions for how tech companies can be more inclusive of workers with family obligations and, in the process, do a better job recruiting and retaining talented women.
1. Provide (Good) Paid Parental Leave
The United States is the only developed country without mandatory paid parental leave. While there are policy efforts under way to address this dismal reality, businesses can and should take the lead. Change.org, for example, recently implemented a paid time off policy providing for 18 weeks of fully-paid leave to every employee who becomes a new parent, regardless of gender.
The tech industry has been at the forefront of offering generous paid time off for new parents, and it isn't surprising that data-driven employers would want to provide such a benefit. When Google looked at its own numbers, it found that improving maternity leave from three months' partial pay to five months' full pay decreased the costly postpartum attrition rate for women (previously twice that of other employees) by a whopping 50 percent. Tech companies that want to retain star employees after they have children, and compete with industry leaders in recruiting such employees, should offer the leave policies new parents need to return to work successfully and ensure employees feel comfortable taking advantage of such policies.
2. Promote Workplace Flexibility
Juggling work and personal life can be stressful for all employees, but for those who bear primary family or caregiving responsibilities -- disproportionately women -- it can feel nearly impossible. By focusing on results achieved rather than time spent at the office, employers can help reduce employees' stress levels and improve the quality of their family time.
Offering flexibility makes good business sense, too. A study released earlier this year found that flexibility significantly increases morale and team performance. Tech companies should adopt flexible work policies that are clearly spelled out and offered to everyone, regardless of gender or parental status. Companies with such flexibility should take care to ensure that employees are not penalized, directly or indirectly, for taking advantage of a flexible work arrangement, paying particular attention to how such an arrangement might affect the work assignment process and promotion decisions.
Forward-thinking companies should also consider the impact of events like all-night hackathons on people with family obligations and host family-friendly social events that allow work and family to complement, rather than detract from, one another.
3. Support Career Return
More traditional industries like investment banking and law have begun to see women returning to the workforce as an amazing untapped resource. Goldman Sachs helped pioneer the idea of a " returnship " -- an internship for high-performing, experienced workers who've taken an extended break from the workforce. In law, the OnRamp Fellowship is a platform that matches experienced lawyers returning to the profession after a few years off with law firms eager to increase gender diversity, particularly in the mid-career level where the legal industry, like tech, sees a mass exodus of highly-skilled women.
To make such a program successful in the ever-changing tech world, companies should seek in potential employees not necessarily the exact skills needed for the role, but the aptitude and potential to quickly develop those skills. In creating such a program, tech companies don't have to reinvent the wheel -- they can easily model the effort on existing internship programs.
4. Lead By Example
All too often, companies claim that "work-life balance is important" and "family comes first," but go on to expect employees to put in nights and weekends in the office in order to be considered for choice assignments and promotions. To foster a culture that is truly inclusive of working parents, it is critical that managers lead by example.
SurveyMonkey CEO Dave Goldberg leaves the office by 5:30 each evening to get home to his kids, and logs back in to continue working after they have gone to sleep. The family-friendly culture he set by example helped SurveyMonkey recruit SVP of Product and Engineering, Selina Tobaccowala, when she was four months pregnant -- a feat the company might not have achieved in the competitive hiring market for engineering talent had they not created a top-down approach to workplace flexibility.
5. Get Creative
Experts at disruption, tech companies have an amazing opportunity to innovate in this space. They can host hackathons (during work hours!) and other brainstorming sessions to leverage the ideas of their own brilliant teams on how to make the workplace more family-friendly. They can also reach out to consultants who specialize in creating targeted strategies for building and sustaining a diverse workforce. By adopting the above suggestions, and experimenting with even more creative ideas, tech companies will not only do a better job attracting and keeping the very best talent, but they'll also begin to create an industry in which working and having a family aren't inherently at odds.

How Human Is Your Company (Quiz)"There is a difference between doing the next thing right, and doing the next right thing."
-- Peter F. Drucker
Online quizzes have suddenly become a "cheap -- if vexing -- form of modern self-analysis," according to The Wall Street Journal . In a recent 24-hour period, 97 million people took a quiz to determine which Disney Princess "matched" their personality; 41 million people tried to determine which state is best suited for their personal traits; and 20 million sought to find out which city they should live in. As this tsunami of lightweight online quizzes engulfs the world, I think you would agree that it behooves us to try and take one that truly matters.
Let's take a quiz that pinpoints how human the companies for which we work are.
Peter F. Drucker, management guru
It's far from a trivial questionnaire, but rather a meaningful form of organizational analysis that gets to the very core of whether or not our companies and their workers will thrive in the new conditions of the 21st century. Taking the " How Human is Your Company? " quiz has a heck of a lot more at stake than figuring out if we're more like Cinderella, Snow White or Mulan. That's because assessing our company's humanity also tells us about our company's capacity for performance.
Yes, I said "performance."
I'll get to that connection in a moment, but first let's get into corporate humanity. In the past several years, more and more companies have been asserting their humanity: Ally Bank speaks human; Chevron is the human energy company; Cisco is the human network; Dow is the human element; JetBlue says they "air on the side of humanity"; Samsung is designed for humans, and so on. The trend is so prevalent and so consequential that Ad Age has even pronounced "human" the newest marketing buzzword. What's more, a recent MarketingWeek article reports on a study that describes a "societal shift in relationships that requires brands to behave like humans in order to connect with consumers and build trust." (By the way, as more and more companies assert their current humanity it raises a question about their previous behavior - did these companies used to be inhuman, monstrous, or were they just inconsiderate?)
Sure, these proclamations can be casually dismissed as marketing campaigns, but keep in mind that marketers are supremely adept at understanding the current context in which their companies operate and pinpointing society's social (read: human) nerve. We should celebrate the fact that some marketers have nudged their companies into a promise of humanity from which they cannot retreat. (Some of these efforts have even catalyzed companies into operating in a more human manner, as we have witnessed before. But we can't stop there. The work of humanizing organizations must spread beyond the marketing department and permeate the whole organization.)
What does it mean for a company to be human? For starters, it means we want our companies to embody the best - not the worst - human capacities and qualities. Peter Drucker's distinction between "doing the next thing right, and doing the next right thing" nails a profound difference between humans and machines. Getting the "next thing right" is what we program software and robots to do by giving them a script of what they can or cannot do. In the same vein, we have scaled a management model where we "programmed" - and still do in some ways -- employees to implement or execute a strategy set by top management.
Doing the "next right thing," however, is a uniquely human endeavor. It requires pausing -- and then using that pause to think beyond what we can or cannot do to grapple with what we should or should not do. This act requires a moral conscience -- one of the main differentiators between humans and other life-forms - which enables us to be thoughtfully conscious of all the stakeholders affected by our behaviors. While machines may beat humans in how fast or how much they can process or produce, our humanity is most manifest in how we do things: how we think, imagine, create, collaborate, share information and relate to others.
It is one thing to develop and manifest one's humanity, but quite another to develop and scale it throughout an entire workforce. The upcoming Global Drucker Forum this November, where I am speaking, will address the responsibility of leaders to transform their companies into more human organizations so as to guide them onto a path of sustainable prosperity. The Forum brings a sharp focus to this critical issue, and in doing so highlights and amplifies the enduring relevance of Drucker's teachings.
Quality was once job No. 1, with companies doing the hard work of systematizing quality (and let me remind you that before it was job No. 1, it was marketed as such). Now, in the 21st century, humanity is becoming job No. 1 because of how easily and inexpensively we can peer into individuals' character and into the inner workings of companies. Because we can see how companies truly behave, we want to see more of how they behave: What does your company stand for? The stakes involved in answering that question are high. As Drucker wisely warned, "There has to be something 'this organization stands for,' or else it degenerates into disorganization, confusion and paralysis." He went on to draw an analogy between companies and humans, by pointing out a company "needs a commitment to values and their constant reaffirmation, as a human body needs vitamins and minerals."
We can now ask, and answer, that core question about corporate character.  The answers -- just like the existence of product defects during the quality revolution of the last century -- are the key indicators of which companies will perform and thrive, and which ones will not survive.
It turns out that the more human your organization is, the better it performs.  The most human companies (i.e. self-governing) significantly outperform less human companies (rules-based or "informed acquiescence" companies, as well as autocratic or "blind obedience" companies) in areas of financial performance, innovation and related measures of success, according to research developed by my company LRN and independently conducted by the Boston Research Group. The research shows that the most human companies are 10 times more likely to outperform less human companies in the short-term, and more than 20 times more likely to outperform them in the long-term. The sum of all behaviors in a company -- and the degree to which those behaviors coincide with, or contradict, its shared values -- form a company's corporate character.
Humanity not only serves as a performance propellant, it also functions as a bulwark. The most human companies are also far less likely to foster inappropriate behavior, including the type that leads to regulatory compliance problems and enforcement actions. That's important right now, given the risk of corruption that our ever-more global enterprises confront. Our organizations operate in a world where more than one in four global citizens has paid a bribe in the past 12 months, according to Transparency International. As I've been asserting for years, how an organization behaves represents the final frontier of competitive advantage.
The fact is that all companies, regardless of their character, are asking their people for much more human contributions. Rather than executing checklists (never mind online quizzes), we want our employees to exercise judgment. Rather than deferring to marketing or PR, we want our people to behave as chief marketing officers while conveying the company's key messages in their own words, through their own networks. Rather than merely providing products and services, we also want our people to forge deep experiences and relationships that will sustain through ups and downs.
The question is whether companies possess a corporate character (the sum of all employees' behaviors) that is consonant and enables, or is dissonant and fights, with these desired human behaviors. How human are our companies currently? Not human enough, according to the early results of LRN's ongoing global surveying of corporate characters: only 3 percent of companies truly qualify as sufficiently human. Changing our corporate characters is difficult but necessary work.  To get started, take the quiz .
You won't find out who you'd be as a princess or whether you're more suited for Boston or Boca Raton. You will find out what your company's made of, how it stacks up against the competition and how well it's suited for principled performance -- the only performance that counts in the 21st century.

Paul Kitterman, the 53-year-old father who went missing during halftime at Thursday's Denver Broncos-San Diego Chargers game, has been found safe, police said.
Denver Police made the announcement on their Twitter account: "DPD confirming that Paul Kitterman has been located and is safe after going missing from the Bronco Game." Later they added: "Paul Kitterman was located in Pueblo, Colorado. Again, he is unharmed. All questions should be directed to the family."
He was later relocated with his family, his stepson Jarod Tonneson confirmed.
Pueblo is about 115 miles south of Denver, and more than 200 miles from Kitterman's hometown of Kremmling, Colo.
Kitterman seemed to be happy and behaving normally before his disappearance Thursday night, his companions said, and told them that the experience of going to his first Broncos home game was "awesome."
Soon afterwards, he vanished.
Police let officials at Sports Authority Field dig through the game's surveillance footage, a process that began Monday, because of their expertise with the camera setups, Denver Police Department spokesman Sonny Jackson said Tuesday. Any intriguing moments on the tapes were to be flagged for police.
Kitterman was sitting with Tonneson after going to the game with friend Tia Bakke and another friend, who were sitting in a different section. He was last seen by his son when he left to go meet those friends around halftime.

Kitterman, a construction worker and ranch hand from Kremmling, did not have his cell phone or any credit cards -- and only had about $50 cash -- when he went to the game, Bakke told ABC News.
"He would never bail on his son or anyone, so by Friday night we knew something was really, really, wrong," Bakke told ABC News.
Police were not actively searching on foot for Kitterman because there was no indication a crime occurred, they said.
Besides the analysis of the surveillance footage, much of the search appeared to be in the hands of friends passing out fliers.
"We searched the stadium we have been going to hospitals," Tonneson said. "We have just been all over the place."
Tonneson, who also works as a construction worker, was one of Kitterman's few regular contacts in the area because Tonneson's parents and siblings live out of state, according to The Associated Press.
"He wouldn't just take off, you know?" Tonneson told the AP. "He wouldn't leave me there."

101 Shots: Man Busts Record With Colossal Starbucks DrinkEmail
Rico Petrocelli
A Florida man broke records Wednesday for ordering the biggest and most expensive Starbucks drink: a 101 shot "Mega" latte worth $83.75.
William Lewis
He brought his own mug too, a 160-ounce novelty cup he bought online as a gag. Into it went a grande latte, 99 more shots of espresso and 17 pumps of vanilla syrup.
"It's an internet challenge," said William Lewis, a political and business consultant and talk show host, "I wanted to beat out the record."
The drink exceeds previously reported records. In July a man in West Virginia had a $71.35 Starbucks drink served to him in a cooler. A few weeks before, a Florida medical student had a 60-shot frappuccino worth $60.58 served to her in a jug with a spigot .
It was all for the LOL's, said Rico Petrocelli, who is running for City Council and shared the cup of coffee outside the store along with long-time friend William, and three other men. That's about 32 ounces per man, a little more than the Starbuck's 31 oz Trenta size. The giant gag cup was poured into normal-sized Starbucks cups for each to drink from.
"It's like pulling up to McDonald's drive-thru and saying, 'give me 600 hamburgers,'" said Petrocelli, a long-time friend of Lewis's.
William Lewis
Lewis routinely entertains his Facebook fans with posts about his morning coffee, usually a six-shot Venti, four-pump Vanilla, one-pump Mocha, extra-hot, extra-fat, upside down latte from Starbucks, and his adventures in "extreme couponing." This combined both pastimes, with the drink as his complimentary beverage on his Starbucks MyRewards loyalty card that grants a free drink of the customer's choice after 12 drinks.
"I game the system," said Lewis.
But this escapade tops his previous caffeinated antics. "This is the apex of his Starbucks career," said Petrocelli.
By rough calculations, this morning's brew contained about 7,500 milligrams of caffeine.
"I advised him not to drink it," said Danielle Strachan, the Starbucks barista who served him the mammoth beverage even though she was worried about getting in trouble for doing so.
Starbucks spokesperson Linda Mills said the policy for the chain, the majority of whose U.S. stores are company-owned, is that its hot beverages can't be served larger than a 20 ounce Venti size.
Lewis's beverage, "is naturally against our policy," she said. As for drinking the gargantuan coffee itself, she said, "We wouldn't recommend it."
Lewis said he was drawn to test the system in part because he feels the 31 oz maximum drink policy "smacks in the face" of the store's other policy of fulfilling any customization customers request. Starbucks spokesperson Mills said that while the chain encourages customers to have fun with their free Starbucks Rewards beverages, like "looking for extra sauces," the chain has to make sure beverages are within the size guidelines, "to protect the product integrity and also to protect the safety of our customers."
Lewis is just revved up that he gets to post about his lark to his fans on social media. 
"It's my daily buzz," said Lewis. "You always want to do it bigger and better."

Microsoft Cuts 3,000 Jobs, Rounding Out July Plan

Aviation Regulator Acts Tough Against Troubled SpiceJet: Report
Seattle: Microsoft Corp on Wednesday said it cut about 3,000 jobs, effectively completing its plan to reduce its workforce by 18,000, or 14 per cent of total staff, announced in July.
The majority of the 18,000 job cuts were in the phone handset business Microsoft acquired from Nokia earlier this year.
"We've taken another step that will complete almost all the 18,000 reductions announced in July," a Microsoft spokesman said.
"The reductions happening today are spread across many different business units and many different countries."
He said 638 of Wednesday's cuts were in Microsoft's home state of Washington, where it has its Redmond headquarters.
Microsoft, the world's largest software company, will have about 110,000 employees once the job reductions are completed. It took a charge of $1.1 billion in its latest quarterly earnings report for the restructuring and integration of the Nokia phone operation and associated job cuts.

Fed Ends Bond Buys  Exhibits Confidence in US RecoveryWashington: The Federal Reserve on Wednesday ended its monthly bond purchase program and signaled confidence the US economic recovery would remain on track despite signs of a slowdown in many parts of the global economy.
US stocks closed with slight losses, finishing off their lows of the session. ( Read full story )
"The Committee continues to see sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing progress toward maximum employment in a context of price stability," the central bank's policy committee said in a statement following a two-day meeting.
The statement largely dismissed recent financial market volatility, dimming growth in Europe and a weak inflation outlook as headwinds that would do little to undercut progress toward the Fed's unemployment and inflation goals.
The Fed pointed to strengthening labour markets, saying that slack in the job market was "gradually diminishing".
It retained its basic language regarding interest rates from recent statements, saying that rates would remain low for a "considerable time" following the end of the bond purchases this month.
The timing and pace of rate hikes would depend on incoming economic data, the US central bank said, new language that apparently earned the support of Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser and Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher, who dissented at the previous meeting.
On inflation, the Fed acknowledged that lower energy prices and other forces were holding inflation down, but that overall the economy should progress toward the central bank's 2 per cent target.
"The Committee judges that the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 per cent has diminished somewhat since early this year," the statement said.
Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota was the only dissent on the grounds that a downturn in inflation expectations meant the Fed should commit to keeping interest rates lower for longer.
The decision to shutter the bond-buying program was almost foregone. The monthly purchases had been steadily cut from $85 billion to $15 billion as part of the Federal Reserve's gradual turn away from policies launched to fight the 2007-2009 recession and breathe more life into a tepid recovery.
The Fed will continue reinvesting the proceeds of securities that mature each month, meaning its more than $4 trillion balance sheet will remain intact for the time being.

Realty Stocks Jump on FDI Relaxation; Orbit  Sobha LeadYou are here: Home Market
Realty Stocks Jump on FDI Relaxation; Orbit, Sobha Lead
NDTV | Updated On: October 30, 2014 16:25 (IST)
IVRCL Allots First Tranche of Shares to CDR Lenders
Shares in realty and construction companies jumped on Thursday, a day after the government relaxed rules for foreign direct investment in construction development. The new rules make it easier for foreign companies to invest in India and many projects will now qualify for FDI through automatic route (no FIPB clearance will be required), analysts say.
The government wants to open up the construction sector to attract investments so that it can deliver on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's promise to create 100 "smart cities" in India by 2020.
Wednesday's announcement is a big positive for realty and construction companies too because the new measures will lead to new funding sources. The realty sub-index on the BSE surged 2 per cent in early trade outperforming the broader Sensex that traded flat.
Here's what the government has done,
1) The government has reduced the minimum requirements for built areas for FDI. Under the new rules, the minimum built area for projects in which foreign investment is allowed will be reduced to 20,000 square metres from 50,000.
2) The minimum capital investment by foreign companies has been cut to $5 million from $10 million.
3) The lock-in period of three years during which the investment cannot be repatriated has been removed. Now, investors will be allowed to expatriate the investment on completion of the project or three years after the final investment is made.
4) The condition that housing projects should provide for 30 per cent affordable housing has been removed.
The new rules will encourage development of smaller projects, especially in urban areas, where the availability of land is limited, said Akash Gupt, executive director at PWC. The risk of delay in smaller projects will be reduced, he added.
JP Morgan says the new measures are good for DLF, Unitech, HDIL, and Prestige Estates. DLF, which is under huge selling pressure for the last one month, rose 5 per cent in trade today.
Among other stocks, Orbit Corp ended 19 per cent higher, while HDIL closed with 6 per cent gains. Hubtown,  Parsvnath Developers, Phoenix Mills, Unitech, Anant Raj and Godrej Properties also closed higher.

Sensex hits all-time high after Fed stance on ratesMarket update: Sensex, Nifty hit new highs on reforms, Fed rate stance

The benchmark Sensex on Thursday surged about 248 points to end at record closing peak of 27,346.33 on across-the-board buying by investors after government eased rules for FDI in construction sector and US Federal Reserve reiterated its plan to keep interest rates at record lows.
While BSE Sensex on Thurday surpassed both its intra-day high and closing high logged on September 8, NSE Nifty barometer hit a new intra-day peak of 8,181.55 but ended at 8,169.20 just a few notches below its record closing peak of 8,173.90.
Prominent gainers which lifted key indices to record highs include RIL, Infosys, L&T, Maruti Suzuki, HDFC Bank, Hindalco, HDFC, GAIL, Dr Reddys, ITC, NTPC, TCS.
"Markets have been on an upward trajectory on the back of renewed vigor shown by government to initiate reforms, lower crude prices and supportive global cues among others. Though Quantitative Easing ended, but Fed keeping the 'considerable period of time' stance for raising rates until it sees more improvement in the economy, cheered markets," said Devang Mehta, Sr VP & Head - Equity Advisory, Anand Rathi Financial.
After opening in positive terrain, the 30-share Sensex continued its upward march and soared to hit intra-day record high of 27,390.60, surpassing its earlier peak of 27,354.99 hit on September 8. The Sensex closed with a gain of 248.16 points, or 0.92 per cent, at new closing peak of 27,346.33, bettering earlier record close of 27,319.85 (September 8).
The 50-share NSE Nifty jumped by 78.75 points, or 0.97 per cent, to end at 8,169.20, after touching a new intra-day high of 8,181.55 that crossed previous record high of 8180.20.
Brokers said sentiments turned extremely bullish after the government had yesterday relaxed rules for FDI in the construction sector by reducing minimum built-up area as well as capital requirement and easing the exit norms. DLF, Unitech and HDIL shares rose in the range of 1.5-6 per cent.
"The equity markets were seen rejoicing. After a flat start, sentiments got some support from positive FII figure of the last session. However, gains remained capped as investors opted to book profits in last half an hour of the session as October derivative contracts were set to expire."
Sectorwise the BSE Realty index gained the most by rising 3.44 per cent, followed by IT index 2.04 per cent. Teck Index rose by 1.77 per cent, Oil and Gas index by 1.65 per cent, Consumer Durable index by 1.59 per cent, Capital Goods by 0.94 per cent and Bankex by 0.72 per cent.

Dynamic entry raids are still dangerous for cops  tooA sad story from California :
 A SWAT officer died early Wednesday, a day after being wounded by a shotgun blast while attempting to force open a door during a pre-dawn raid at a Southern California home, authorities said.
Pomona Police Officer Shaun Diamond, 45, succumbed to his injuries at a Pasadena hospital, Chief Paul Capraro said in a statement.
 The suspect in the shooting, David Martinez of San Gabriel, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder of a police officer. He was jailed on $4 million bail, and it wasn’t immediately known if he had a lawyer.
Diamond was wounded as he attempted to lead fellow officers into the home around 4 a.m. Tuesday, Los Angeles County sheriff’s Lt. Eddie Hernandez said.
“When Officer Diamond was attempting to breach the outer door of the location, the interior door opened and he was met with gunfire,” Hernandez told reporters at a news conference outside the hospital.
He said Diamond, who was wearing a helmet, appeared to have been struck in the back of the head by a single gunshot that also hit the suspect’s father in the arm.
Martinez, 36, surrendered without incident, Hernandez said. Officers did not return fire because the suspect’s father was in the way, he said.
This article from the Pasadena Star-News has a few more details:
On Tuesday morning, a group of about 14 officers arrived at the location, announced their presence, and when no one opened the door, attempted to break the lock on an outer door, said Lt. Eddie Hernandez of the Sheriff’s Department homicide bureau.
As Diamond worked to open the door, investigators think Martinez’s father opened the interior door and Martinez fired a shotgun from behind his father.
The spread of the shotgun hit Martinez’s father in the arm and Diamond in the head, Hernandez said . . .
After discharging the shotgun, the suspect dropped his weapon and lay on the ground before officers reached him. Only one shot was fired, and it was fired by the suspect, Hernandez said.
There is no indication law enforcement personnel serving the warrant were ambushed, he said.
“The officers at this point did not have a clear shot on the suspect,” Hernandez said.
The warrant was served at 4am. Martinez has a criminal history, including domestic abuse and assault with a deadly weapon. That said, his actions here strongly suggest he thought his house was being invaded by criminals. If Martinez knew these were cops and decided to take them on, whether with the intent of killing them all or to escape, it makes little sense for him to fire a single shot, then immediately surrender. That sounds much more like the actions of a guy who was taken by surprise, fired his weapon in self-defense, then surrendered when he realized the people breaking into the house were law enforcement officers.
There may well be more, but this at least the third incident I can think of in a year in which a law enforcement officer was killed during a dynamic entry raid to serve a warrant. In one Texas case , the man who killed the officer was cleared by a grand jury. The police found some pot plants in his home. A second Texas man is currently facing murder charges . The police found no drugs in that home. And then there are of course the people killed by police officers in these raids, like David Hooks and Jason Wescott , both killed this year.
Dynamic entry tactics work well when you’re using overwhelming force to defuse an already violent situation. But none of these situations were already violent. This latest incident may have involved a violent person. But he wasn’t in process of committing a violent crime. The tactics the police used here created confrontation and risk. Why not apprehend him as he’s coming or going from the house?
I suspect few people will have much sympathy for Martinez. But the tactics also put his father at risk, a guy neighbors spoke highly of to the local media. These tactics put cops at risk. Other bystanders,  like children, are at risk too. All unnecessarily. At some point, maybe we’ll accumulate enough bodies to start realizing that.

Houston mayor drops church subpoenasHouston Chronicle (Katherine Driessen & Mike Morris) reports:
The city of Houston will withdraw its controversial subpoenas of five pastors tied to a lawsuit over the city’s equal rights ordinance, Mayor Annise Parker announced at a news conference Wednesday….
Parker last week had left the subpoenas in place with narrower wording, removing any mention of “sermons.” However, Parker said two Tuesday meetings, one with local pastors and another with national clergy, persuaded her to pull the subpoenas altogether.
The move is in the best interest of Houston, she said, and is not an admission that the requests were in any way illegal or intended to intrude on religious liberties….
Read the Houston Chronicle piece for more details. I discussed the legal issues raised by such subpoenas here and here . Thanks to Jim Bell for the pointer.

Pentagon agency: Watch out for Islamic State attacks in the U.S.By Dan Lamothe October 29 Follow @danlamothe

Recent threats made against U.S. troops by the Islamic State call for vigilance, including varying routes to work, limiting social media activity and hiding Defense Department IDs while in public, according to a new warning from the agency that protects the Pentagon.
The warning was issued Oct. 24, and posted online by the Military Times newspaper chain Wednesday. It was issued by the Pentagon Force Protection Agency, a civilian-run organization in the Defense Department that is responsible for protecting occupants and visitors at the Pentagon and other facilities.
The warning was issued two days after a series of shootings rocked Ottawa, Canada’s capital. They were carried out Oct. 22 by Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a 32-year-old Canadian who authorities believe was motivated by Islamist ideology . He shot to death an honor guard soldier, Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, at Canada’s National War Memorial and was killed after opening fire again in the nearby Parliament building. Another Canadian soldier, Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent, was killed by another alleged extremist man in a hit-and-run car crash two days prior.
The Pentagon’s security warning referenced threats and recent attacks in Canada, Britain and France, and urges Department of Defense employees to exercise caution.
“Targets in recent ISIL-linked terrorist plots included places of public gatherings, government entities, mass transit nodes, and religious facilities,” the warning said, using one of the acronyms for the Islamic State. “Attacks would most likely involve edged weapons, small arms, or improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and could be perpetrated with little or no advanced warning.”
Numerous military commands also have put out similar advisories in recent days, considering it a prudent measure, said Air Force Lt. Col. Thomas Crosson, a Pentagon spokesman. The Pentagon’s suggests the following safety measures, some of which are quite strict:
– Use operational security at work and home
– Secure Defense Department buildings passes when in public
– Remove Defense Department, military or law enforcement decals or identifiers from clothing and vehicles
– Vary travel routes to and from work
– Report suspicious activity
– Maintain situation awareness or avoid public venues with large gatherings of people
– Educate family members on basic security practices
– Be careful in what is shared on Twitter, Facebook and other social media
– Lock down social media accounts when not in use and change passwords regularly
– Do not post anything on social media that affiliates you with the military or law enforcement
– Do not post anything on social media opposing terrorist groups or organizations
Service members and their families at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla., received similar warnings last week.

You are what you Facebook likeBy Caitlin Dewey October 29 Follow @caitlindewey
(Facebook)
Daily life is basically a constellation of microscopic choices. Let’s say you choose to read some Ayn Rand on the bus home from work today. Then let’s say you play Pandora’s country hits while you make dinner. Next week, when the polls open up for the 2014 midterms, you’ll weigh your options and choose to vote for Republican candidates.
To you, each of these choices is discrete, isolated — even random. But to Facebook, the 1.35-billion-user behemoth where we increasingly record our daily choices, no person, comment or casual thumbs-up is isolated: Everything is part of a larger pattern.
And in this particular instance, according to data Facebook released Monday , your pattern played out precisely as the social network might have predicted it would: Generally, Facebook fans of Republican candidates are far more likely to also be fans of Blake Shelton and Ayn Rand.
(Facebook)
There are more trifling insights where that came from, of course: Democrats disproportionately listen to The Beatles; Republicans tend to watch “Duck Dynasty”; the Jersey Shore is the one vacation spot all Americans agree on. (Jersey, you can have that mention for free.)
But while these tidbits are interesting — funny, even! — they’re just whispers of a much larger operation. Facebook is inferring millions of such correlations, based on billions of disparate data points, predicting any number of user behaviors. In many cases, it’s also selling those data points back to advertisers, political campaigns and other people who are interested in manipulating all the tiny daily choices you make. In an update made to Facebook’s ad platform  in May , the site released a trove of new, anonymized data to advertisers, showing them — among other things — the demographics and “liked” pages of potential customers, the better to help companies learn their “interests and behaviors.”
“Help people decide,” the network crows in  its materials  targeting political campaigns. “Facebook is one of the most effective marketing platforms on the planet.”
(Facebook)
That’s true, in large part, because of how much Facebook knows about us: age, family, location, education level, on- and 0ff-site behavior. (Advertisers can target all these things.) But given all that objective, demographic data, it’s amazing how much Facebook can still infer from our subjective likes. The like, after all, is the single most thoughtless, fleeting gesture in all of Internetdom — it’s a single click, an almost Pavlovian response to things we find vaguely interesting or noteworthy or at least worth acknowledging. It’s “the wordless nod of support in a loud room,” the blogger Elan Morgan  wrote in August  as part of her experiment not to “like” anything on Facebook for two weeks. It’s just another way to signal we exist amidst the constant onslaught of Internet noise.
Reading through your own liked pages should confirm as much: Mine amount to little more than a senseless jumble of local bars and restaurants I once wanted to try, random companies I followed to unlock sales or specials, and the long-forgotten side hustles of entrepreneurial friends. Facebook itself hasn’t even had the feature for a full five years.
(Facebook)
And yet, simply by virtue of its scale, Facebook can vacuum up all those senseless data points — all those clicks, all those tiny choices — and parlay them into something like an insight about your identity. These are just observations and correlations, mind you, but they’re still pretty striking: Oh, you liked the campaign page for New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo? You might also like “The Great Gatsby.” Did you fan the page of Hello Kitty or Flo the Progressive Girl at one point? You, for whatever reason, are more likely to vote.
Tell its data team what pages you’ve liked, and Facebook will tell you who you are.

Americans new way of losing weight left Weight Watchers behindBy Drew Harwell October 29 Follow @drewharwell
Don’t even think about it. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg
This should be the perfect time for a company like Weight Watchers to thrive. The U.S. is still one of the fattest nations on the planet with a third of the country considered dangerously overweight. Global obesity has nearly doubled since 1980, growing into one of the world’s most intractable public health crises — and opening a huge market for the weight-loss industry.
Yet Weight Watchers, the 50-year-old diet giant selling a slimmer, fitter America, has never looked so gaunt. The company said Wednesday that its third-quarter revenue had plunged to its lowest point since 2010, extending an unprecedented seven-quarter money-losing streak. Its market value has fallen to $1.1 billion, its lowest point in history.
So what happened? Instead of paying for a subscription to one of Weight Watchers’ signature support groups or learning how foods translate into “points,” Americans seeking to shed a few pounds are looking, instead, to free fitness apps on their smartphones, a simple shift that has devastated one of the most iconic names in weight loss.
“We do not believe that free apps will solve the obesity epidemic,” chief executive Jim Chambers said in a call with analysts late last year. But “I see now that the situation we are facing as a business and organization is more difficult than it originally appeared.”
The rise of smartphones opened an entire ecosystem of new apps that could suggest diets, count calories and track progress, undercutting Weight Watchers’ longtime business model. And because many are free, they’re gobbling up the company’s most important audience: trial-minded newbies looking for a change but hesitant to fully commit.
The popularity of free health apps has exploded alongside fitness monitors, like the FitBit, which cost only a one-time fee and offer a simple, visual, social element to exercise in a way Weight Watchers still can’t. And Weight Watchers has never been cheap. Duke University researchers said in July that the average Weight Watchers subscriber paid $377 a year and only lost five pounds — in other words, paying about $75 per pound.
“It’s a matter of free vs. not free,” said Efraim Levy, an analyst with Standard & Poor’s. “There are so many free apps out there to help people lose weight that people are choosing to at least try. … It’s really a cost initiative, and that will remain a challenge, and they have to restructure to hope to compete.”
Founded in the early ’60s by an overweight New York housewife, Weight Watchers found its claim to fame largely due to its social appeal: support groups of women meeting often to talk diets, and all the reasons they shouldn’t cheat. Over the decades, it ballooned into a corporate powerhouse, fueled by a sale in the late ’70s to the Heinz food conglomerate, which sold branded frozen meals to dues-paying attendees of the firm’s bustling weight-loss classes.
About a million people attend more than 40,000 Weight Watchers meetings every week worldwide, according to an S&P report, and the program remains well-reviewed: The U.S. News & World Report this year  ranked  it the country’s best diet for losing weight.
But Weight Watchers is far from the only player in America’s $60 billion weight-management industry. Their competition has expanded beyond longtime rivals like Jenny Craig and Nutrisystem – both with their own sales woes – to larger sophisticated players like Nike seeking to win over a growing fitness-minded clientele.
Half of the company’s revenue comes from meeting dues, with the rest tied to online subscriptions and sales of things like snack bars, books and points calculators. But even the packaged parts of Weight Watchers’ business model are shrinking, losing out to health-conscious eaters opting more for fresh foods. The market share for Weight Watchers’ frozen-ready meals has fallen to its lowest level since 2005, beaten handily by Stouffer’s, Lean Cuisine and Healthy Choice, data from market research firm Euromonitor show.
Weight Watchers has tried to change with the times. They launched a  mobile app  with a barcode scanner, food log and meeting finder, announced partnerships with fitness trackers and, this month, unveiled a few upgrades  to better match the iPhone’s new health and fitness suite. Earlier this year, the company spent an undisclosed sum to buy Wello, a Silicon Valley startup offering streaming video of fitness classes.
But other campaigns have done little to fatten their business. The number of subscribers to WeightWatchers.com, their online plan, dropped about 7 percent last year, and a big push to appeal to both genders has mostly floundered; only 18 percent of today’s online users are men . The company is working to win over corporate America by installing company-wide fitness plans, but even those membership numbers remain slim.
“They’ve signed up some bigger companies, but even if you’re an employer with 100,000 employees, the number of people signing up will be … a drop in the bucket,” said Kurt Frederick, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. “They need a lot of big companies to make a big swing in that mix. And they haven’t gotten to the point where its a big piece of the business.”
Every quarter of this year is expected to see double-digit sales decreases over the year before, a losing streak the company didn’t even see during the Great Recession. Investors have also lost confidence the company can turn it around: Shares today are selling 65 percent below their 2011 peak. And there’s little optimism about future prospects: JPMorgan analysts wrote this summer that 2015 looks like “another difficult year.”
As the crucial New Year’s diet season nears, the company said it’s trying hard to engineer a turnaround. Their big strategy to compete with the app-store diet, they said: The human touch.
“It is our fundamental belief that tools alone, technology alone, food programming alone will never reach the levels of success that are possible when they are combined with human engagement,” said Chambers, the chief executive, in an analyst call in July. “The strength of the Weight Watchers brand is and always will be in the human connections that make a weight-loss journey more successful.”

Information can t be disclosed outside specific proceedings: Swiss govtDepartment of Finance
(The comments come at a time…)
NEW DELHI/BERNE: Amid a debate on disclosure of names of suspected black money holders, Switzerland today said information exchanged under Swiss-India tax treaty cannot be disclosed "in principle" to a court or any other body outside the proceedings of a 'specific and relevant' case.
The comments come at a time when a Supreme Court-monitored Special Investigation Team is probing alleged stashing of black money by Indians aboard, including Swiss banks.
Switzerland, long accused of being a safe haven for illicit funds, has promised to extend assistance to India and reply to requests for information in a "time-bound" manner on cases of alleged tax evasion and financial crimes, or provide a reason if no information can be shared.
Explaining the treaty provisions about disclosure of such 'secret' information, a Swiss Finance Ministry spokesperson told PTI from Berne that authorities from the two countries are having "regular contacts on bilateral tax matters" but refused to comment on particular cases.
The government yesterday gave to the Supreme Court a list of 627 Indians with accounts in a Swiss branch of HSBC bank, on which probe for suspected black money is underway.
While this list was given in 'sealed envelopes', three other names were made public a day earlier as prosecution had been launched against those persons.
There has been a debate on whether disclosure of names, without prosecution, could violate tax treaties under which these names and other details are shared by foreign countries.
Replying to queries in this regard, the Swiss Federal Department of Finance spokesperson said that the protocol to Swiss-Indian DTA (Double Taxation Agreement) states that any information received "by a contracting state shall be treated as 'secret' in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that state..."
The treaty further provides that any such information "shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of (information), the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes ... or the oversight of the above."
The Swiss Finance Ministry spokesperson further said the treaty states that "such persons or authorities shall use the information 'only' for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions".
"Accordingly, the information exchanged under the terms of the DTA can be provided to a Court in situations where it is dealing with a specific case related to tax matters for which this information is relevant. Conversely, information cannot be disclosed in principle to a Court or another body outside of such proceedings," the official added.
 
The spokesperson, however, declined to comment on "particular cases", citing the confidentiality provisions of the Swiss-Indian DTA.
"We can nevertheless inform you that the relevant authorities of Switzerland and India have regular contacts on bilateral tax matters," the Swiss official added.
The exchange of information on tax matters between India and Switzerland is based on the double taxation agreement (DTA) and the protocol that was signed in 2010 between the two countries. It has been in force since October 2011.
"This agreement is in line with the international standards and provides for exchange of information on request," the spokesperson said.
The list of 627 persons with accounts in a Swiss branch of HSBC bank was received by India from the French government, while it had earlier got another list of Indians with suspected black money accounts from Germany.

(Raju was arrested by the…)
HYDERABAD: A special court here will pronounce its verdict on December 23 in the accounting fraud in the erstwhile Satyam Computer Services Limited , nearly six years after the the multi-crore rupee scam jolted corporate India.
Special judge B V L N Chakravarthi fixed December 23 for pronouncement of the much-awaited judgement. All the ten accused in the case, including prime accused Satyam Computers founder and former chairman B Ramalinga Raju and his brother and Satyam's former MD B Rama Raju, appeared in the court, as per its direction.
The media was not allowed inside the court. "Case is posted for judgement on December 23. In all probability, it (verdict) will be delivered on that date, failing which, because of the volume of the case, it might take a few days more if at all," CBI's special Public Prosecutor K Surender said.
The others accused in the case are ex-CFO Vadlamani Srinivas, former PwC auditors Subramani Gopalakrishnan and T Srinivas, Raju's another brother B Suryanarayana Raju, former employees G Ramakrishna, D Venkatpathi Raju and Ch Srisailam, and Satyam's former internal chief auditor V S Prabhakar Gupta.
The court, in the meanwhile, heard arguments by the defence and prosecution after Raju had filed an application before it challenging the authenticity of some of the electronic evidence presented by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) that investigated the fraud.
The defence contended that some of the electronic evidence submitted against Raju and the others accused was inadmissible because it was not retrieved in accordance with provisions of the Evidence Act.
Touted as the country's biggest accounting fraud, the scam came to light on January 7, 2009, after Ramalinga Raju allegedly confessed to manipulating his company's account books and inflating profits over many years to the tune of several crores of rupees.
Raju was arrested by the Crime Investigation Department of Andhra Pradesh Police two days later along with his brother Rama Raju and others.
Raju and others were charged with offences like cheating, criminal conspiracy, forgery and breach of trust under relevant sections of IPC for inflating invoices and incomes, account falsification, faking fixed deposits, besides allegedly falsifying returns through violation of various I-T laws.

AHMEDABAD: In a huge relief for people living near Gujarat's coastal areas, the MeT department today said that 'Nilofar', earlier dubbed as a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm (VSCS) over west-central Arabian sea, is likely to make a landfall near Naliya in Kutch tomorrow as a 'depression'.
"As it moved further into the sea during the past six hours, it has weakened and become a 'severe cyclonic storm' from VSCS . Nilofar is now expected to hit Naliya and other parts of Kutch on October 31 evening with low intensity, which can be called as depression, not as marginal cyclonic storm," state MeT department official Ajay Kumar said.
As per the latest MeT bulletin, severe cyclonic storm Nilofar has moved east-northeastwards during the past six hours and currently lay centred at about 620 kms west-southwest of Naliya in Kutch.
"It would move northwestwards and rapidly weaken into a depression over northeast Arabian Sea off north Gujarat coast by October 31 evening," said the bulletin.
According to MeT, moderate rainfall at most places in the state would occur under the influence of that system.
"The wind speed would remain between 40 kmph and a maximum of 60 kmph during that time. Some isolated places of Kutch and Saurashtra may get heavy to very heavy rains during the next 48 hours," said Kumar.

First high speed train on Delhi-Agra section...Delhi-Agra speed train
(RCF has manufactured…)
KAPURTHALA: The first high-speed train between Delhi and Agra with a speed of 160 km per hour is expected to run on November 10 as Kapurthala Rail Coach Factory is all set to roll out the first rake of fourteen coaches of the train.
Rail Coach Factory (RCF) has manufactured four coaches of the high speed train so far and the work was going on war footing to manufacture the remaining ten coaches by November 10 to turn out the first rake, RCF General Manager Pramod Kumar said today.
RCF engineers in consultations with RDSO (Research Development and Standard Organisation ) had made some changes in these coaches in designing of coupler system for more smoother ride than Shatabdi and Rajdhani coaches, installation of smoke and fire detection system and automatic sliding of inner doors besides Passengers information system.
The GM said the approximate cost of one high speed coach would be between Rs 2.25-2.50 crore.
He said that high speed coaches manufactured in RCF for Shatabdi and Rahdhani express trains are capable of running at the optimum speed of 160 kilometer per hour.
The GM said railways has selected ten routes on which high speed trains would run as announced by railway minister in his budget speech.
Initially speed of these trains would be 160 kilometer on select rail routes and gradually it would be enhanced up to 200 kilometer after upgrading the signalling system, barricading the area, he said.
The railway board and officials of railway department had already conducted a trial on these coaches on Delhi-Agra section at a speed of 160 kilometer and covered the 200 kilometer distance in 99 minutes a few days ago, a railway official said.
The RCF has also started working on the high speed coaches capable of running at a speed of 200 kilometer per hour by making some changes like automatic outer doors, changes in braking system with the provision of electro pneumatic brakes, noise reduction with better sound insulation, provision of TV set on the back of every seat in the executive chair cars and WI-Fi system besides improved vestibules, the GM said.
He said that high speed coach capable of running at 200 kilometer per hour would be rolled out by June next year.

MUMBAI: The benchmark indices ended at all-time closing highs led by gains in technology, oil & gas, banks and realty sectors even as the US ended its Quantitative Easing program.
The market recorded its highest ever turnover at Rs 10.5 lakh crore.
According to analysts, the market is in bull-grip and the momentum is likely to take Nifty to 8,300 in November series itself.
The S&P BSE Sensex surged 6,060 in last 52-weeks to hit an all-time high of 27390.07 in trade today.
It ended at all-time closing high of 27,346.33, up 248.16 points or 0.92 per cent. The index touched an intraday low of 27088.65.
The Nifty has rallied 1,870 points in the last one year to close at an all-time closing high of 8169.20. The index hit an all-time high of 8,181.55 and intraday low of 8,085.20 today.
"We have seen an extremely good spirited sort of a bounce back and who would have thought that QE ending and close near 8,200 would actually coincide," said market expert Ambareesh Baliga.
"We are close to the top end of the band and crossing these levels will be a bit difficult. In case we cross this, technically there is the possibility the markets can go 8,350. It would be more of a trading bet than buying for an investment at this point of time," he added.

Woman harassed over 100 times in 10 hours on NYC streets gets rape threatsNew York woman who was harassed 100 times in 10 hours gets rape threats
Agencies

A video that shows a woman being harassed by men on the streets of New York over 100 times within 10 hours has gone viral. The actor, Shoshana Roberts, has now spoken out on her entire experience that has been created to heighten awareness of street harassment.
Roberts and her friend secretly recorded her walking through the streets of New York City in jeans and a T-shirt as man after man greets her with remarks such as "hey, baby" or "hey, beautiful”. When she does not respond, she is admonished for being rude with comments such as "smile" or "somebody's acknowledging you for being beautiful. You should say thank you more."
The actress describes the motive as, “The frequency is something alarming, and people might know that this was happening but not to the degree that it actually is."
Watch: NYC woman who filmed herself being harassed on the streets speaks out
The two-minute video called '10 Hours of Walking in NYC as a Woman' has been viewed over 13 million times since being uploaded to YouTube on Tuesday. As views of the video skyrocketed, Roberts said she had received violent threats online. "The majority of the reactions by email were positive but unfortunately a few ones were negative, involving hurting me, killing me. I'm going to go to the police because I don't feel safe," the actress added.
The video has been produced for charity Hollaback!, which works to end street harassment endured by women and minority groups. The charity said Roberts was also threatened with rape in some comments to the YouTube post. Hollaback! executive director said, "We want this video to show people who are harassed that they are not alone, that we have their back. And for the people doing the harassing, want them to see the impact that this has on us."
Roberts said pestering is a daily reality, which may not always be verbal.

Moody s Welcomes India s Policy Steps  But Wants to See MoreIron Ore Imports Surge as Prices Fall
Moody's welcomed recent efforts by India's government and the Reserve Bank to boost economic growth and attract long-term investments, but said the measures would need to be sustained to have an actual impact on the country's sovereign ratings.
Moody's Investors Service said steps such as Prime Minister Narendra Modi's "Make in India" campaign, infrastructure initiatives, improvements on monetary policy framework, and banking sector reforms were all "incremental, rather than radical" measures.
But Moody's said it wanted to see "sustained improvement" in the reform momentum for "over at least the next two years" to have an actual impact on India's credit ratings.
Moody's rates India at "Baa3", or the lowest investment grade, with a "stable" outlook. It was the only one among the three major global credit agencies not to downgrade India's outlook to "negative" over the past three years.
"Since India's sovereign rating already incorporates Moody's assessment that its growth potential is high, such higher growth rates would, in themselves, be of limited (though positive) significance for India's sovereign credit profile," the agency said.
Moody's said an assessment of India's credit ratings would only come after it sees sustained improvements in inflation, investment climate and policy predictability and transparency.
The credit agency added it wanted to see stronger fiscal, balance of payments and banking sector metrics.

High-speed ship to launch submarine drones  U.S. commandosBy Dan Lamothe October 30 Follow @danlamothe
The USNS Choctaw County will be used to launch Special Operations troops and submarine drones as part of Bold Alligator 2014, a military exercise off the coast of North Carolina and Virginia in which the Navy and Marine Corps will examine future ways in which troops could be used in times of crisis.

The Navy and Marine Corps will launch exercise Bold Alligator 2014 on Saturday, focusing not only on conventional amphibious operations, but cutting-edge concepts including the use of  a drone submarine and the deployment of Special Operations troops from one of the Pentagon’s newest kinds of ships.
The USNS Choctaw County is a joint high-speed vessel, and will be operated off the coast of North Carolina and Virginia by civilian mariners with the Navy’s Military Sealift Command. The 338-foot ship is one of the Pentagon’s new catamarans, designed for the rapid movement of troops and equipment at speeds of up to 50 mph. It has room to land helicopters and a ramp so troops can quickly unload equipment.
One team from 1st Marine Special Operations Battalion, of Camp Pendleton, Calif., will be involved in the exercise, and will use it for several kinds of maritime missions, including one using the joint high-speed vessel, said Capt. Barris Morris, a spokesman for Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC). The MARSOC team will focus on operating with conventional forces while directed by Special Operations commanders, he said.
Conventional Marines and Dutch troops also will use the Choctaw County as part of the exercise, said Lt. Gen. Robert Neller, the commander of U.S. Marine Corps Forces Command in Norfolk, Va. Other high-speed vessels have been used in other exercises this year, and while they are not built for Marines and sailors to live on them full-time, the military is examining ways to incorporate them into its work.
“We’re going to go out there and try this alternate platform, and that’s where I think we’re going to go,” Neller said. “There’s a lot of things we can do off a high-speed vessel.”
U.S. military officials would not say what kind of drone submarine will be involved. The Navy has experimented with several kinds of drone submarines in recent years, including some that assist in Special Operations .
Special Operations troops are examining how to use other new ships, too. In July, for example, Navy SEALs and members of Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command worked from the Navy’s new littoral combat ship , the USS Independence, in the 2014 Rim of the Pacific exercise off the coast of Hawaii. Navy and Marine Corps officials said they are also looking for ways to use the new Mobile Landing Platform ship class, which features an unusual design with a ramp that will allow larger ships to transfer vehicles to the MLP directly.
Bold Alligator is much broader than just Special Operations and drones, however. The exercise will include about 8,000 U.S. and international troops, led by the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit of Camp Lejeune, N.C. Nineteen other countries will participate, and 19 ships will be involved, U.S. military officials said .
The exercise was first held in 2011 as a simulation, as the Marine Corps and Navy sought to reestablish amphibious operations after more than a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan. It was expanded in 2012 to include thousands of U.S. and international troops off the coast of Virginia and North Carolina, with many of them participating in a landing on a beach at Camp Lejeune.
This year, Bold Alligator will pivot to focus on crisis-response operations. Neller said there won’t be a single large amphibious landing, and the troops involved do not yet know what they will be told to do. That echoes real-world scenarios: The Marine Corps has established several crisis-response units abroad since last spring, one of which was among the first involved in the military’s ongoing participation in the international effort to stop the spread of the Ebola virus in West Africa.

9Lives brings Morris back for another life, online
From a Hinsdale shelter to stardom, Morris the Cat is a Chicago story. So is his relaunch.
Move over "Grumpy Cat." Morris, the original finicky feline and star of countless TV commercials, is back to take his place among digital "It Cat" contenders online.
Created by Chicago-based Leo Burnett in 1969, Morris — as cats do — has had several lives as the spokescat for 9Lives cat food. The latest incarnation is a digital-only campaign with all the contemporary accouterments: Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts, a blog and an interactive video, hoping to connect with cat fanciers online.
"We wanted to reboot Morris for the older consumers who are very fond of him, but also bring him back in a way that's culturally relevant for today's consumer," said Carrie Schliemann, business director for cat food and snacks at Big Heart Pet Brands. "Cats rule the Internet, and online is where consumers are right now."

Morris, and 9Lives, are owned by San Francisco-based Big Heart, formerly part of Del Monte Foods, which launched in February as the nation's largest stand-alone pet food company. Big Heart's other products include Milk-Bone, Meow Mix, Natural Balance and Kibbles 'n Bits. The privately held company generated revenue of $2.19 billion last year, according to financial statements.
The relaunched campaign with the iconic orange tabby began this month, a $2 million ad budget with sky high social media aspirations. The campaign is the work of San Francisco-based digital agency Evolution Bureau, with the support of FCB Chicago, among others. Chicago-based Starcom is heading up media buying.
While the new campaign has a paw in the West Coast, "Morris the Cat" is at its core a Chicago story, with a rags-to-riches pedigree.
According to the Tribune's reporting from the 1960s, Morris — originally known as Lucky — was discovered and adopted by animal trainer Bob Martwick at the Hinsdale Humane Society. Martwick, a Lombard resident who worked extensively in the advertising business, took the cat to an audition for a 9Lives commercial and, well ... a star was born.
"He jumped on the table ... and he walked right up to the art director, the big cheese, and bumped him in the head. And then Morris just sat back," Martwick said according to his 2001 obituary in the Los Angeles Times. "The art director said, 'This is the Clark Gable of cats.'"
The original Morris made dozens of TV commercials from 1969 until his death in 1978. The spots featured actor John Erwin voicing the thoughts of the caustic cat, who would barely tolerate the playful entreaties of his owner until she said don't be finicky and offered up 9Lives.
The cat with attitude spawned countless media appearances, including a role in the 1973 movie "Shamus," starring Burt Reynolds. He also paved the way for other feline stars from "Garfield," the cartoon cat created in 1978, to "Grumpy Cat," the reigning online cat star who recently inked a movie deal.
The new Morris campaign will be looking for similar social traction and is banking on earned media to help sell a variety of 9Lives products.
While Morris will still have attitude, he is cast as choosy more than finicky, Schliemann said.
"The old Morris was more finicky and could be a little bit negative at times," Schliemann said. "We're re-establishing Morris as much more positive. He's a discerning cat, but discerning in a positive way."
The inaugural offering is an interactive video called "Cat's Eye View," in which Morris dons wearable tech glasses and leads viewers on a wisecracking journey through his house, ending as the TV commercials of yore, with an eager dash to his bowl for his 9Lives.
An EVB copywriter provides the voice of the new Morris, who also shares another important link to the original storyline. The new feline star was also rescued from a shelter, Schliemann said.

Payrolls rose by 321,000 in November, way above the 230,000 estimated, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 percent, a six-year low.
The report blew past forecasts, but also raised expectations that a rate hike from the Federal Reserve may materialize sooner than previously thought.
Ronald Sanchez, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International in New York, said the number was "unambiguously strong," though it "could mean some changes to policy recommendations with the Fed. June 2015 is back on the table for when rates could rise."
Financials <.SPSY> rose 1 percent as higher interest rates would prop up earnings in the sector. Bank of America  rose 2.7 percent to $17.68 while Goldman Sachs  was up 1.8 percent to $195.45, boosting the Dow.
Utilities <.SPLRCU>, a dividend play, fell 0.8 percent as Treasuries yields rose. Energy <.SPNY> fell 1.2 percent alongside a 1.7 percent drop in crude  prices. Most sectors ended well off their highs of the session.
"The day's market action has to be seen in the context of the recovery we've had year-to-date. Payrolls confirm the strength of the economy, but that strength is reflected in stock prices," said Sanchez, who helps oversee $16 billion in assets.
Separate data showed new orders for U.S. factory goods fell for a third straight month in October, pointing to a slowdown in manufacturing activity.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 58.69 points, or 0.33 percent, to 17,958.79, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 3.45 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,075.37 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.32 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,780.76.
For the week, the Dow rose 0.7 percent and the S&P rose 0.4 percent. It was the seventh straight weekly gain, a streak not seen in a year for both. The Nasdaq fell 0.2 percent on the week.
American Eagle Outfitters  fell 13.8 percent to $11.91 after the teen apparel retailer forecast a current-quarter profit below analysts' estimates and reported its fifth straight drop in quarterly income.
About 5.81 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data.
NYSE advancers outnumbered decliners 1,614 to 1,480, for a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,809 issues rose and 927 fell, for a 1.95-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 98 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 168 new highs and 93 new lows.

3 principles for entrepreneurs in  this next wave  of clean energy1
Companies that move toward exits inspire a change in how venture capitalists operate. “You need to be very wise with how you raise money and especially how you spend it until you show that momentum,” Day said. “If you have clear momentum towards an exit, you will be able to track capital.”
Complete solutions
Pitch ideas that will see faster market adoption and higher value. Don’t stop at information; think automation to be the “play” in plug-and-play.
“Being able to go out there and tell the market, ‘Hey, we’ve got something that’s turnkey,’ just makes it a lot easier for them to say yes,” Day said. “Once you’ve got them saying yes, have them say yes to more stuff. That’s more revenue for you.”
The Midwest region offers tremendous assets, Day said. The key to winning the next phase of clean energy is to combine talent with financial and technical expertise.
Entrepreneurs should “go out and force change to happen,” he said. “The more you can offer a complete solution to the marketplace, the more acceptable you are.”

Advice for growing companies on lease flexibility  economic incentives0
“With the EDGE tax credit, that’s where our North Star is — jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs,” Pollet said. “If you can come and tell the state or city or county that you will provide jobs, you will unlock the ability of that public entity to help. If you create a certain number of jobs, we will give you a tax credit against your liability to the state.”
Pollet said small companies can access the EDGE program by creating at least five jobs and spending at least $1 million, which can include the capitalized value of a lease. The state provides up to $500 per employee to offset employee training costs, capital grants and low-interest loans, he said. It also offers research and development tax credits along with credits to angel investors to help spur investing.
“The priorities are to make sure we have the ecosystem here that supports startups that become growth companies that become big companies,” Pollet said.
Serot cautioned small companies against signing long-term leases when they are uncertain about growth rates.
“How can you tell you tell your client in good conscious to sign a long-term lease obligation? You can’t,” he said. “The best advice is to go out and try to find something flexible. Maybe it’s a sublease. Maybe it’s a law-firm space where you’re going to get a 50-percent discount on the rent but gives you time to evaluate the company 12 months from now before making a long-term commitment.”

How to sell subscriptions - for everything0
Subscriptions have paid off handsomely for some startups, including Birchbox (beauty products), Blue Apron (make-at-home meals), and Dollar Shave Club (men's razors). The three have collectively raised more than $150 million, and each serves hundreds of thousands of customers per month. When the  model works , it's great. Customers pay up front, giving the business the cash flow to fund operations, and recurring sales mean predictable revenue. But if you plan to start selling subscriptions, make sure you can answer these questions:
1. Are your customers ready for commitment?
“You can't just convert to a subscription business and expect your revenue to grow,” says Michael Dubin, CEO of Dollar Shave Club, which ships razor blades to more than 800,000 members. “Is the subscription an enhancement for your customer? If not, then don't do it.”
Dollar Shave has been subscription-only from its inception; Dubin launched his business on the gut feeling that other men hated the process and cost of buying razor blades as much as he did. But other companies, including meal service Plated and digital library Scribd, have simultaneously offered single-purchase and subscription options. Scribd still offers both, but CEO Trip Adler says readers far prefer the flexibility of a monthly pass. Acquiring such market insight can take a long time.
Planning Pod spent years building a wedding-planning software tool — only to discover “that brides will spend $7,000 on a wedding dress but won't pay $30 a month for software,” co-founder Jeff Kear says. Planning Pod eventually found more customers among event planners.
2. How long can you sustain risk?
Supply and demand often will not immediately match, putting your finances in jeopardy. Plated spent six months testing dozens of price points and menus before finalizing its ready-to-cook meals; co-founders Nick Taranto and Josh Hix funded the tests by emptying retirement accounts and maxing out credit cards, burning through tens of thousands of dollars. “There's a long trough of doubt and hardship before you get back to managing success,” Taranto says.
3. Can you sacrifice your traditional retail relationships?
If you succeed at subscriptions, you may find yourself winding up in a brick-and-mortar setting; witness Birchbox, which opened its first physical location in July. “We are bringing our tried-and-true 'try, learn, buy' model to our store,” says co-founder Katia Beauchamp. But it can be more difficult to do the reverse and back away from the traditional retail model, especially if you already have well-established business relationships. Evermore Pet Food sells frozen pet meals via distributors to approximately 75 retailers, but now co-founder Hanna Mandelbaum wants to sell subscriptions directly to consumers. That would give Evermore a wider distribution, better margins, and a more consistent cash flow — but it could also damage sales to the loyal retailers that built the brand. “I need to make more money, but I also need them,” says Mandelbaum.
Ultimately, short-term sacrifice may be necessary to make a long-term subscription model pay off. Scribd lets subscribers read unlimited books, but it must pay publisher fees for each book checked out — a cost that can outweigh revenue from voracious readers. But Adler says he'll forgo some short-term returns to build up loyal subscribers: “The main thing is, you want people to keep using it for a long time, because that leads to more revenue.”

Dollar surges as Fed ends QE on hawkish note2
Traders shifted bets on the Federal Reserve's first round of interest-rate increases to July 2015 from September 2015 before the report.
The jobs report caused the yield on U.S. 2-year Treasuries  to rise to its highest since May 2011, according to Reuters data. The yield curve flattened, with the differential between the five-year note and the 30-year bond falling to its lowest level since January 2009.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note  was off 14/32 and yielding 2.3047 percent.
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies <.DXY> to its highest level since March 2009. The dollar also hit multi-year peaks against the euro  and against the yen . The U.S. dollar index hit a peak of 89.467, up 0.86 percent on the day.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 58.69 points, or 0.33 percent, to 17,958.79, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 3.45 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,075.37 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.32 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,780.76.
"Payrolls confirm the strength of the economy, but that strength is reflected in stock prices," said Ronald Sanchez, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International in New York
Stock traders balanced the encouraging fundamental strength in the U.S. economy with the prospect of a rate rise.
Financial shares led gains. The S&P financial index <.SPSY> was up 1 percent, with higher interest rates expected to boost earnings in the sector. Utilities, a dividend play, lost ground as Treasuries yields rose. The S&P utility index <.SPLRCU> was down 0.8 percent.
MSCI's global share index <.MIWD00000PUS> was up 0.1 percent, while an index of European shares <.FTEU3> ended up 1.8 percent as a weaker euro boosted exporters.
Gold  dropped more than 1 percent, suffering from the dollar's strength, while Brent  and U.S. crude  continued their slide.
Spot gold  was down 1.2 percent at $1,190.90 an ounce. Brent crude fell 57 cents to settle at $69.07 a barrel, while U.S. crude oil futures dropped 97 cents to settle at $65.84.

First drive: Volkswagen s all-electric 2015 e-GolfVehicles Manufacturing and Engineering Automotive Equipment
Volkswagen will bring the e-Golf to the U.S. this fall, but automakers typically lose money on electric cars
The VW e-Golf, coming to the U.S. this fall, gives up no interior space despite its 700-pound battery pack
For several years, Volkswagen has been watching the race to develop viable electric cars from the sidelines.
But this fall, the German automaker will bring its first all-electric vehicle to the U.S., a battery-powered version of the venerable Golf, the hatchback that has sold more than 30 million copies globally over six generations.
Dubbed the e-Golf, this model uses the same platform and body as gas- and diesel-powered Golfs, which have all been redesigned for the 2015 model year.
The electric effort is overdue. Nearly every other U.S. automaker (Honda, Toyota, GM, Chrysler, Ford, Nissan, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz) offers a zero-emission vehicle in California. This is to meet a mandate by the California Air Resources Board requiring that each brand either sell such a vehicle or buy credits from automakers that do.

Automakers typically lose money on electric cars, despite generous state and federal subsidies to buyers. But it's the price of entry to the nation's largest auto market — and key to building brand awareness and engineering prowess amid growing consumer demand for clean, efficient cars.
The late arrival doesn't bother VW.
"We'd rather do it right the first time," said Lars Menge, general manager of product strategy for VW of America.
Many automakers quickly churned out electric cars with subpar powertrains or build quality, he said.
"We came up with a much better car, so now all others have to stretch to follow us," Menge added.
That's a bold claim, considering the strengths of competitors such as the Nissan Leaf, Fiat 500e and Honda Fit EV. But a day darting around San Francisco shows that VW's first electric vehicle lives up to the big talk.

Oil - A Question of Economicsreddit
The recent debate over falling oil prices has become an over simplified economic question of supply and demand, ignoring other interrelated economic theories. Despite the global recession, oil demand has remained at 90-91 million barrels per day (mbd) over the past 5 years. However, due to the recession, Western nations have slowly reduced their demand. Meanwhile low growth, fuel efficiency, and demand in Asia has risen to compensate for this fall. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has reduced its growth forecasts for 2015 suggesting that demand may grow modestly by a 1 mbd to nearly 93 mbd.
Despite the political instability in parts of the MENA region, supply has managed to keep up with demand. This is largely due to the emergence of shale oil in the United States, which has ramped up its production to 8.7 mbd, which is 1 mbd more than last year. Some commentators even suggest that US oil production may reach up to 12 mbd by 2015. Meanwhile, Russia has also been putting record volumes of crude oil on to the market.
A decrease in demand and an increase of supply has caused oil prices to fall over the past five years from an average of $110 to $85 per barrel this year. The oil and gas media are full of doom and gloom about how these prices are unaffordable for the Middle Eastern nations who will now rack up budget deficits if the current price level persists. Some media outlets have even placed the blame of the price fall on OPEC's shoulders, citing the revival in production in Libya and Iraq for the current demise. OPEC has consistently produced around 30 mbd, reaching a peak in 2012 of 31 mbd and remains near to that today. However, the largest increase in world supply was brought on by the U.S. and its drive for self-sufficiency. The U.S.'s investment in shale oil has lead to an ever increasing supply coming on stream. This ultimately reduces the U.S.'s need for high priced imports, and leaves large quantities of West African oil looking for buyers. Under these conditions, the U.S. may soon be exporting oil into the market, although many commentators remain skeptical that the U.S. export ban will be lifted any time in the near future. Yet with or without the ban, the U.S. is already exporting record amounts of refined products and incidental condensates from its shale oil, leaving great impacts on prices in the oil markets.
With western media suggesting OPEC should reduce production and avoid deficit financing, there seems to be an issue of double standards arising. Should we ask the U.S. to abandon plans to export oil? Surely, the MENA countries could follow America's lead and ask China to finance its deficit as well and allow market capitalism to run its full course. The competition theory in economics tells us that high costs and inefficient producers will be driven out of the market as prices fall. Doing so would eventually drive out the high cost and environmentally threatening deep water, arctic, tar sands and shale oil fields. In the long run, higher output at lower prices will finance and in due time reduce the deficit of the low cost oil producers. In addition to this, the true cost benefit analysis of these environmentally threatening, high cost shale oil fields might be recognized if we follow this path.
Many economic commentators are failing to see the benefits of lower oil prices. Virtually all businesses will benefit from lower transportation costs by expanding their profit margins or passing the benefit to consumers at lower prices. The lower income groups, who spend a higher proportion of their incomes on transport, will see their disposable incomes rise, benefiting retailers who serve their needs and thereby increasing demand in the economy. Food prices are also likely to fall, as food production, processing and sales distribution are energy intensive activities, thereby benefiting lower income groups further. Increased consumption will stimulate aggregate demand, creating investment opportunities and economic growth. Governments in the west may also have the opportunity to increase fuel taxes to cover the real cost of the negative externalities of carbon emissions, or raise revenue to improve public transportation systems. Furthermore, governments in the Middle East and Asia will reduce spending on their fuel subsidies and may take the opportunity to improve the workings of market forces, which the IMF and Western powers have been seeking for them to do.
As many Western economies are seemingly slowing down again, with most of them still struggling with stubbornly high unemployment levels, they will only benefit from the current sharp drop in oil prices which will stimulate the global economy. Moreover, countries now have the opportunity to replenish stocks and protect themselves against future price hikes. Stockpiling begs the question: how long will prices remain relatively low compared to recent years? Will they fall further? $60 would certainly kick start substantial economic activity or will supply be rained back?
In the past, we have seen the US and its Western partners put pressure on OPEC, and the world's only swing producer Saudi Arabia, to increase supply so as to lower prices or maintain price stability. Are we about to see them create further price fixing market imperfections by asking the Saudis to cut production so as to create a return to higher prices? Much of the Western economic commentaries are suggesting the Middle East will fall apart as falling oil revenues will create unaffordable budget deficits, cuts in government spending, and political uprisings amongst their populations and ultimately scare Middle Eastern governments into considering cutting back on OPEC supply.
The recent period of high but stable oil prices has induced an economic recovery in the U.S. based on lower oil and energy prices, propped up Putin's government and economy which has become more heavily dependent upon its oil revenues, and increased the sovereign wealth funds of the GCC countries of the Middle East. Meanwhile, the rest of the world has suffered economic malaise consigning a generation to a life of unemployment and it appears that some commentators may want to maintain this status quo. Lower oil prices would likely benefit all via economic growth, and not just a few nations self-interests. This brings us to ask: have we been sacrificing economic efficiency for U.S. energy self-sufficiency?
If we can enjoy a period of sustained low oil prices where consumer disposable incomes rise and increase world aggregate demand, we may witness recovery in Europe and rising growth rates again in Asia. This would fuel economic activity at a time when a generation has been lost to unemployment, and maybe allow them to regain for a better future.   In this case oil prices will either recover, or rise in demand may equally bring about a rise in supply, ultimately increasing the revenues of oil produces.
Economic theory suggests that a lower price delivered by lowest cost producers is economically efficient. The lower prices will either force high cost producers out of the market or encourage them to seek lower cost technological solutions to stay in the market. The economic solution to our energy requirements is to invest in low cost producers instead of preventing them from reaching the market by financing chaos in the Middle East and Africa. Instead, supporting the development of low cost oil reserves in the Middle East and Africa would benefit these populations. The wealth created from oil revenues could be used to develop infrastructure, education, and health systems, rather than being frittered away by corruption and cronyism. However, this requires international oil and gas companies as well as the U.S. government to rethink their geopolitical strategies and adopt the capitalist model of economic efficiency, rather than supporting a model of imperfect competition and short term self-interest. As the world's largest open economy, the US would benefit more in the long run from encouraging world economic growth, rather than trying to protect its high oil price by fair means or foul.

Moody s wants to see more of PM Modi reformsMoody's wants to see more of PM Modi's reforms
Neha Dasgupta     Mumbai   Last Updated: October 30, 2014  | 16:59 IST
Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Moody's welcomed recent efforts by the Modi government and the Reserve Bank to boost economic growth and attract long-term investments, but said the measures would need to be sustained to have an actual impact on the country's sovereign ratings.
Moody's Investors Service said steps such as Prime Minister Narendra Modi's "Make in India" campaign, infrastructure initiatives, improvements on monetary policy framework, and banking sector reforms were all "incremental, rather than radical" measures.
But Moody's said it wanted to see "sustained improvement" in the reform momentum for "over at least the next two years" to have an actual impact on India's credit ratings.
Moody's rates India at "Baa3", or the lowest investment grade, with a "stable" outlook. It was the only one among the three major global credit agencies not to downgrade India's outlook to "negative" over the past three years.
"Since India's sovereign rating already incorporates Moody's assessment that its growth potential is high, such higher growth rates would, in themselves, be of limited (though positive) significance for India's sovereign credit profile," the agency said.
Moody's said an assessment of India's credit ratings would only come after it sees sustained improvements in inflation, investment climate and policy predictability and transparency.
The credit agency added it wanted to see stronger fiscal, balance of payments and banking sector metrics.

Six months is a long time. It is nearly the time a trip to Mars would take, according to Mars One, a not-for-profit foundation that seeks to establish a permanent human settlement on the planet whose average distance from the Earth is 225 million km. It is also the time a 1,622-km-long road journey in India could take.
Two years ago, heavy engineering company ISGEC was transporting three consignments of column - process equipment weighing between 53 metric tonnes and 158 metric tonnes, and six meters high - from its factory in Gujarat's Dahej to the Jindal Steel & Power plant in Angul, Odisha. Along the way, the company faced three railway shutdowns, made five detours where roads were being built, trimmed 100 trees after local permissions because of the column's height, and removed and reinstated 200 overhead power cables. It also paid off villagers a dozen times to allow the consignment to pass, and its drivers and supervisors were manhandled 13 times. The road barely existed in the last 100 km. The equipment was delivered in 180 days.
This journey tells the tale of making in India - manufacturers everyday face headwinds due to poor infrastructure, lack of environment clearances, local trouble, and slow decision making. Add labour trouble, land issues and taxation bottlenecks and you have a sector that is deep in the woods.

Growth in the market capitalisation of BT 500 companies has fluctuated over the past five years. From 52.16 per cent in 2010, growth slumped to 13.66 per cent in 2011 and 5.20 per cent in 2012. It recovered to 13.14 per cent in 2013 and to 32.28 per cent this year. Also, the number of manufacturing companies in the BT 500 list shrank from 236 in 2009 to 202 in 2013, before recovering to 215 in 2014.

This is not all. Manufacturing's share in the country's gross domestic product has fallen in recent years, from a high of 16.28 per cent in 2011/12 to 14.94 per cent in 2013/14. And latest data continues to indicate a slowdown - manufacturing output fell 1.4 per cent in August from a year earlier because of a lack of new orders. In a quarterly survey in August, industry lobby FICCI said 71 per cent manufacturing units didn't have plans for capacity addition for next six months with capacity utilisation remaining stagnant thus far. More than 64 per cent said they may not hire additional workforce in next three months, according to the survey.

It is in this context that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's high decibel 'Make In India' campaign is so refreshing to many industrialists. On September 25, he unveiled the campaign's logo - a striding lion made of cog-wheels - and promised manufacturers "effective governance", not just "good governance". The campaign has three pillars: making it easier to do business by removing licensing and regulatory hurdles, enabling infrastructure such as industrial corridors, and opening up foreign direct investment in a number of sectors including defence, construction and railways. The National Manufacturing Policy aims to create 100 million jobs by 2022 and increase the share of manufacturing in India's GDP to 25 per cent.
Still, investors, like the FICCI survey hinted, remain cautious and are on a wait-and-watch mode. Modi is going in the right direction, they say, but they want more than just assurances.
CROUCHING LION
For 'Make in India' to succeed, the government needs to address the concerns of three sets of manufacturers - existing investors, those who want to expand in India, and foreign investors. Existing investors who have suffered setbacks because of recent court rulings need a high dose of the confidence opium.
"The private sector in India feels highly insecure. The government is not consistent, (and) a lot of reversals take place," says Ravi Uppal, Managing Director and Group CEO of Jindal Steel & Power. "Today, people are questioning the validity of any document given by the government. It comes to saying that any document given by the government must be endorsed by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, the Central Vigilance Commission, the Central Bureau of Investigation, and finally the Supreme Court before it becomes a valid document," he adds.
The Supreme Court recently cancelled the permits of 214 coal blocks allocated without auction between 1993 and 2010 by various governments. Miners have time till March 31, 2015, to hand over the mines to the government. Jindal Steel is one such company caught between a rock and a hard place. "We employ 30,000 people in our mines. They will be laid off," says Uppal. The company will not just face disruptions in coal supply, but also has a total investment of `36,000 crore at stake. "The opportunity lost will be in terms of future investment," he says.
The Modi government has to win back this fast receding investor confidence. "There needs to be consistency in government policy. There must be a legislation to say that when government decisions are made, they cannot be questioned. This kind of protection must be given," stresses Uppal.
Existing investors in India also need protection against outdated labour laws. Labour unions inside factories have been resorting to strikes and sabotage to press for higher wages and reverse disciplinary measures. In 2012, automaker Maruti Suzuki's Manesar plant faced a nasty labour strife, culminating in a management representative being charred to death. Another case in point is Parle Products's Bangalore factory. The company applied for closure of the plant after it could function for just three and half months between 2011 and 2013. Workers had halted production after an employee was suspended for abusing a personnel officer.
Toyota Kirloskar Motor faced similar problems this year. Between February 10 and March 15, the union at the carmaker led the disruption of shop-floor operations at its factory near Bangalore 32 times, resulting in a production loss of 1,988 vehicles, which led the company to declare a lockout. The lockout was subsequently lifted and management was eventually able to enforce discipline. "We cannot allow a minority to hold the majority to ransom," says Shekar Viswanathan, Vice Chairman and Director at Toyota Kirloskar Motor. "The labour department has to play a keen and instructive role, fostering better relations with management. Labour is a state subject. Every chief minister, labour secretary and junior functionary in the department must say we cannot compromise on discipline. It is management's right to enforce it," he adds.

Labour reform, agrees Surinder Kapur, Chairman of auto parts maker Sona Group, is needed to improve India's competitiveness. He says workforce in India is not disciplined enough. "In most factories, people are not working for eight hours. It varies from five to seven hours," he says. India's output per worker, at $3,067 in 2013, is nearly half of China's, according to the International Labour Organization.
In particular, industry groups and companies have been lobbying for a change in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. The Act mandates companies employing 100 or more workers to seek prior permission of the government for firing workers. Chapter V B of the Act bars companies from shutting shop or downsizing quickly - a company needs to seek permission from the government three months in advance. This locks up capital in unproductive assets. "Small and medium enterprises need to be given a holiday from labour laws for the next seven years, " says Kapur. "That's the kind of impetus you need."
A small start has already been made in this direction. On October 16, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched five initiatives under a new scheme titled Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Shramev Jayate Karyakram to address some of these problems. The initiatives include simplifying compliance of 16 labour laws through a single online form and a transparent Labour Inspection Scheme aimed at ending undue harassment by factory inspectors.
HANDLE THE ELEPHANT, TOO

Anyone, say manufacturers, can delay projects in India. In his Delhi office, replete with horse sketches, Puneet Dalmia narrates a tale of how a non-governmental organisation (NGO) threw a spanner in the works two years ago. The Managing Director of Dalmia Bharat Cement recalls that, at one of the company's greenfield projects, a local NGO claimed the road connecting its plant to the main road was in forest land. The company was dumbstruck because there was no forest there. But the NGO argued the region was an elephant track. "As a solution, the NGO wanted funding for elephant conservation. They came up with a `4 crore budget, saying they need to buy jeeps and laptops," says Dalmia. The company did not pay up but created an underpass for the animals to cross, if at all.
Often, projects get delayed also because some land owners don't want to sell their plots. "You may need to do 1,500 transactions to complete the entire land purchase since land holdings are small in India. You don't get contiguous land," says Dalmia. "There are patches that remain unsold. If you are stuck because of a small plot, you pay a hefty price. Then others who sold land a year back also come back to negotiate. This has happened many a time."
In the company's project costs, the maximum inflation has been in the price of land - 20 to 35 per cent a year across states. Dalmia Bharat Cement has operations in 14 states.
Other manufacturers face similar problems in land acquisition, which could lead to changes in business plans. German agro-equipment maker Lemken wanted to set up a plant in Pune in 2008 and was hunting for 20,000 square meters of land as the city had good infrastructure and skilled manpower, says CEO Arvind Kumar. But the company couldn't find a plot of land and finally went to Nagpur to set up the factory.
All these come at a time when foreign countries are aggressively looking to generate employment and are eyeing Indian investment. Apollo Tyres, for instance, is setting up a factory in Hungary that would employ 900. "We were chased by a number of countries - Slovakia, Poland, Hungary," says Onkar Kanwar, Chairman and Managing Director of Apollo Tyres. "We selected Hungary because our belief has been always to have a plant close to facilities where you know people can live and work properly. It's a one-and-a-half hour drive from Budapest." Kanwar is hesitant to link his expansion in Europe to the difficulty of getting things done in India but says land prices in India have become exorbitant. "Where we used to pay `10 lakh an acre, the same land is available for `1 crore now," he adds.
Adi Godrej, Chairman of the Godrej Group, points to a "funny law" that prohibits development of land under the Coastal Regulation Zones. "All coastal cities are badly affected by this - no other country in the world has such a law. Things like land reclamation is becoming difficult in India... All these come in the way of manufacturing development," he says.
Doing business has become tougher in the past few years, he adds. Too many permissions are required from too many agencies, and there are delays in environment clearances and land acquisition. To set up a cement plant, for instance, it takes 43 clearances from different agencies. "It becomes extremely complicated," says Godrej.
SO WHAT CAN MODI DO?
Godrej's solution - minimal permissions from the government, be it the state or the centre. "The government should have an adequate land bank. Simplification is the key to getting it done. The law of the land should be that if a certain permission is not granted within a certain period, say three months, then it is assumed to have been granted," he suggests.
Intricately linked to the high cost of land and the complexity of operating in India is the high cost of financing a project. Manufacturers want the government to relax lending norms. For instance, a steel plant of one million tonnes costs $1 billion and banks require promoter equity of 25 per cent for lending. "The promoter must have $250 million. Not many people have that kind of cash," says Uppal of Jindal Steel. "The government should have a guideline that says banks can go up to 90 per cent lending."
'Employment comes from manufacturing. Unfortunately, in the last 10 years, there has been a lot of talk, but no action. The result is we are stuck at 15 per cent (of GDP) in manufacturing,' says Onkar Kanwar, Chairman and Managing Director, Apollo Tyres. Picture: Shekhar Ghosh
Most domestic banks, laden with bad loans, may not agree with Uppal. But in many countries lending norms are easier and interest rates lower than in India, which works to the advantage of multinational companies. Jindal Steel, for instance, has set up a two-million-tonne steel plant in Oman. "Banks gave us money with a smile with favourable terms. The cost of loan is six per cent. In dollar terms, the rate is less than five per cent. India is at 12 per cent," says Uppal.
Smaller companies are being asked for personal guarantees by banks, says Kapur of Sona Group. "The stumbling block in automotive is that Tier-II and Tier-III suppliers are not growing at the pace they should because they are not being funded by banks. If suppliers don't grow, the alternative would be imports to overcome shortage. There is a cost to it," he adds. His company is taking vendors to banks, explaining to bankers that they need loans to operate.
S.V. Sukumar, Partner and Head of Strategy and Operations Practice at KPMG in India, says India must also ensure protection of intellectual property rights to boost manufacturing. "If high-end manufacturing comes to India, design will too. There must be protection for multinational companies R&D," he says.
INDIA SAFARI CUT SHORT
Foreign direct investors don't face a cash crunch. They have other headaches. Over the past few years, Indias income tax department has slapped tax evasion notices against multinationals ranging from Vodafone and Nokia to Shell India and General Electric. "Tax terrorism", a term that gained popularity in the run-up to general elections this year, includes retrospective taxation and claims on withholding tax. Both have earned India a bad name.
In 2012, the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government amended a law to retrospectively tax deals between any two companies if the underlying assets were in India, affecting mobile-phone operator Vodafone that had bought Hong Kong-based Hutchison Group's stake in Hutchison Essar. Similarly, Nokia has been slapped with two tax cases totalling `17,658 crore, and the implication has been disastrous for Indian manufacturing, employees and a growing electronic assembly ecosystem in Chennai. Nokia's Sriperumbudur factory, once the world's largest mobile-phone plant with 8,000 permanent employees producing 15 million handsets a month, will down shutters on November 1.
In February this year, the Tamil Nadu Sales Tax department slapped a tax case accusing Nokia of not having exported any of the mobile phones it manufactured at the plant between 2009 and 2011. "We find this claim surprising since we have customs documentation showing we exported more than 400 million phones during that period," a Nokia spokesperson had told Business Today earlier.
The second dispute relates to withholding tax. The Income Tax Department claimed `15,258 crore in unpaid taxes, interest and penalties as Nokia India showed the payments made for buying software from its head office in Finland as 'purchase transactions', not 'royalty payments'. While tax experts, such as Sanjay Sanghvi, Tax Partner at Khaitan & Co, say there was no tax liability in a purchase transaction concluded outside the country, authorities treated Nokia as a defaulter. Authorities also froze the company's manufacturing assets, preventing a transfer to Microsoft, which announced acquisition of Nokia's devices and services business in 2013. Nokia let go most of its employees and the plant became a contract manufacturer for Microsoft. The US-based company recently informed the handset maker it will terminate their manufacturing services pact from November 1, prompting Nokia to suspend production at the plant.
Brett Young, a corporate communications executive at Nokia Corporation, told BT the asset freeze by the tax department prevents the handset maker from exploring potential opportunities to sell the factory to any other company. "Nokia is now evaluating options to minimize the impact on the over 1,100 employees remaining at the manufacturing facility," he said in an e-mailed response. To attract investments, said Young, India should up set fast-tracks courts to resolve disputes and end practices that do more harm than good to all stakeholders - asset freezes being one example. "It is also critical to quickly resolve existing tax disputes sparked by retrospective taxation policy shifts. Companies that have operated with the same business model for many years, and have been regularly assessed and audited by the tax authorities, should be able to expect a reliable and consistent business environment," Young said.
But until India creates such an environment, manufacturing will resemble a lamb - not a lion. There is much work to be done before the cogs start to turn.

Xiaomi becomes 3rd largest smartphone vendorXiaomi becomes world's 3rd largest smartphone vendor, says study

Xiaomi, the Chinese smartphone maker , has become the world's third-largest smartphone vendor just three years after first hitting the market, trailing technology giants Samsung Electronics and Apple, according to a new industry study.
Strategy Analytics said Xiaomi accounted for 6 per cent of all 320 million smartphones shipped during the July-September quarter. South Korean technology major Samsung made up 25 per cent share, down from 35 per cent in 2013, due to rising competition from several directions.
Apple's smartphone share also fell slightly to 12 per cent.
"Xiaomi was the star performer," Strategy Analytics Executive Director Neil Mawston said in a statement.
"Samsung continues to face tough competition from Apple at the higher-end of the smartphone market, from Xiaomi and Huawei in the middle-tiers, and from Lenovo and others at the entry-level," Mawston said.
Xiaomi has been the top seller in China, which is its home market, and recently entered the domestic smartphone market , where it sells phones exclusively through e-commerce website Flipkart.
In September, Vice President Hugo Barra told Reuters in Bangalore that the company aimed to sell 100,000 phones a week in the domestic market in October when the country celebrates Diwali.

Maruti Suzukis net profit jumps by 28.7 per cent on volume growthMaruti Suzuki India sold 3,21,898 units of vehicles during Q2, a growth of 16.80 per cent. (Reuters)
Written by Sandeep Singh | New Delhi | Posted: October 30, 2014 4:16 pm
Driven by a strong volume growth of 16.8 per cent and net sales growth of 17.5 per cent in the quarter ended September 2014, Maruti Suzuki saw its net profit jump by 28.7 per cent to Rs 862.5 crore over the same period last year.
In another development that may have a bearing on shareholders of the company, MSIL announced that its board of directors have recommended to raise the FII shareholding limit in the company from existing 24 per cent to 40 per cent. This however remains a proposal for now as it needs the shareholder approval and then will have to await RBI’s nod.
The company’s board also approved its dividend payout guideline which states that the dividend payout will now range between 18 and 30 per cent each year. In the year ended March 2014, the company had a dividend payout ratio of 15 per cent.
While the company is looking to come out with various products going forward, the market leader said that its new SUV will be launched in the first quarter of next year.
Shares of the company rose on the back of the result and closed with a gain of 1.1 per cent at a high of Rs 3,242 on Thursday before hitting an all time high of Rs 3,297 per share.

Piramal Glass  others shut units as GAIL cut...Piramal Glass, others shut units after GAIL cut gas supplies

(Piramal Enterprises…)
NEW DELHI: State-owned GAIL's drastic cut in natural gas supplies to small industries in South Gujarat has led to few gas units like Piramal Glass shutting down part of their operations.
GAIL last month selectively slashed gas supplies to small industries to meet fuel requirement of CNG and piped cooking gas supplies in cities. The company on September 27 cut supplies to 30 industries in South Gujarat but did not touch small users in other states.
To meet city gas requirement, GAIL was to pro-rata cut gas of non-priority sectors like steel and refineries but ended up snapping nearly 60 per cent supplied to small industries, which as per a June 2005 order of oil ministry were clubbed with priority users in power and fertilizer for fuel supplies. No subsequent order has defined non-priority users.
Piramal Enterprises vice chairperson Swati A Piramal last week wrote to Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel against the "discriminatory" action of GAIL that has led to her firm and others like Pragati Glass, Haldyn Glass, Gujarat Borosil and Orient & Savana Ceramic shutting down few lines in their plants.
"This action by GAIL works a little contrary to the 'Make in India' program recently launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
"While on the one hand the Government of India is committed to increase job opportunities and get foreign investment by transforming India into a manufacturing hub, on the other hand the decision to cut gas impacts the viability of operating units that have been contributing to the nation for decades," she wrote on October 23.
The total allocation to 30 small consumers in South Gujarat is a mere 0.6 million standard cubic metres per day. The cut has made available only 0.35 mmscmd available for PNG/CNG use. In absence of domestic gas, the small units have to buy imported LNG which costs four times the domestic rate.
"Reducing the gas from small consumers singularly from with the state (of Gujarat) and diverting it to city gas is discriminatory especially when the priority of both sectors were equal," she wrote. "We earnestly urge that small gas consumers should be treated as priority (user)."
She asked Patel to impress upon Union Petroleum Ministry to not apply a unilateral cut on the small consumers of south Gujarat, who individually have allocation of no more than 50,000 cubic meters per day, but impose an "equal and pro-rata cut across all APM (or administered price gas) users in the country to fulfil the shortfall to the city gas."
"By doing this, the impact on small gas consumers would be minimal (may be 1 per cent compared to present 58 per cent cut). This would ensure the future viability of the industry and revenues for state of Gujarat and the needs of city gas will also be fulfilled," Piramal added.

News reports do not reflect spirit of my CAG meet speech: FMPTI Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.

Under attack over his remarks that official auditor should not “sensationalise” its audit findings , Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday said media did not accurately reflect the spirit of his speech at the CAG conference.
“News reports of my speech at the CAG conference do not accurately reflect the spirit of my speech,” Mr. Jaitley said in a Facebook post. The Finance Minister has also uploaded the link of the speech he delivered at the valedictory meet of the annual Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) conference in New Delhi on Wednesday.
Mr. Jaitley in his speech had said the government auditor should not sensationalise its findings to get into headlines. “Auditor should be conscious of the fact that he is reviewing a decision that has already been taken. Have the fair procedures been followed? He doesn’t have to sensationalise. He doesn’t have to get into the headlines,” he had said.
Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Thursday took a dig at Mr. Jaitley for asking the CAG not to sensationalise its findings to get into headlines. “CAG should not sensationalise its findings,”— Arun Jaitley. Wish he had realised this when 2G and coal block CAG reports came!”, the Congress general secretary tweeted.
The Congress party had voiced similar views in the past after huge notional losses were projected in reports on 2G and coal allocation scams. Another Congress leader Ajay Maken said his party “strongly condemns” Mr. Jaitley’s statement. “When CAG report used to be leaked even before it was placed before the Parliament, and when the Finance Minister’s party, based on that report, use to disrupt Parliament for days, did he forget that CAG was being sensationalised then also,” Mr. Maken said.

Modi govt s austerity drive: No 5-star hotel meetings  first-class air tickets for babusComments
The Narendra Modi government on Thursday ordered a ban on first-class air travel by top bureaucrats as part of its austerity drive to cut down on unnecessary expenditure and make the most of available resources.

The government also told ministries to reduce non-plan expenditure, barring them from making new financial commitments, purchasing new vehicles, creating new posts and holding conferences at five-star hotels.
Government expenditure is classified under two broad heads — plan and non-plan. Funds spent on creating assets through programmes and schemes come under plan expenditure, while non-plan expenditure refers to all spending, including establishment and maintenance activities of the government and the small-bore measures are aimed at cutting discretionary spending by 10% in the fiscal year to March 2015.
“In the context of the current fiscal situation, there is a need to continue to rationalise expenditure and optimise available resources,” said an order issued by expenditure secretary RN Watal that clamped down on secretaries flying first-class while travelling abroad. Last year’s austerity drive had advised them to avoid first-class travel, but quite a few ignored the suggestion.
Containing expenditure is central to the government’s aim to keep the fiscal deficit — shorthand for the amount of money the government borrows to fund its expenses — within the budgeted 4.1% of GDP in 2014-15.
The move comes a month after Prime Minister Modi frowned at secretary-rank officers going on frequent foreign trips, saying they should travel only if sending a joint secretary- or additional secretary-rank officer does not serve the purpose.
However, the government made a few changes to earlier versions of the austerity drive to avoid unnecessary inconvenience and paperwork. For instance, it exempted security forces from the ban on buying new vehicles.
In the past, security forces had to seek the finance ministry’s approval for every purchase. “This rule was a big impediment and slowed down our expansion,” said a central reserve police force officer.
The finance ministry also relaxed the rule forcing all officers except secretaries to travel by economy-class, which will now allow officers of the rank of joint secretary and above to travel business-class. The ministry, while striking down the earlier rule that was often criticised as unnecessary, said departments would, however, not be given any more money than what is already budgeted.
“However, there would no bookings in first-class,” Watal’s memorandum said.
The government will also not entertain proposals for participation in study tours or conferences abroad except those that are fully funded by the sponsoring agencies.

Kerala govt s liquor ban gets HC nod  700 bars to be shutKerala HC upholds liquor ban, 700 bars to be shut
HT correspondent , Hindustan Times  Thiruvananthapuram, October 30, 2014
First Published: 15:11 IST(30/10/2014) | Last Updated: 22:13 IST(30/10/2014)
Comments
The Kerala High Court on Thursday upheld the state government’s decision to close down about 700 bars in a boost for the administration which aims to make the state alcohol-free by 2023.
The court, however, allowed heritage and four-star hotels to serve liquor apart from five-star ones that were already exempted.
Kerala has India’s highest per capita alcohol consumption at more than eight litres per person annually while the national average is 5.7 litres.
Bar owners and hoteliers who had challenged the government order in the high court said they will now approach the Supreme Court.
The Congress party-led UDF government has closed more than 400 bars since March by not renewing their operating licences.
“It’s a welcome move. Our aim is total prohibition in a phased manner,” said chief minister Oommen Chandy on the high court order.
The government’s decision came this year after many members of the political class complained about increased underage drinking, a binge-drinking culture and drinking by women in the state.
Thursday’s verdict means the liquor bars in 33 four-star hotels, 21 five-star hotels and eight heritage properties can function.
Total prohibition would cause a monetary loss of about Rs. 9,000 crore a year to the state as sale of alcohol is a key source of revenue for Kerala apart from Gulf remittances.
The government would also have to rehabilitate nearly 25,000 workers at bar hotels who would lose their jobs.
Bar owners say with the alcohol ban Kerala would lose much of its charm as a tourism spot and people would opt for nearby destinations like Goa or Sri Lanka.

Bengal: Naqvi held briefly during Birbhum visitComments
Members of a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) team were briefly arrested on Thursday as it tried to enter Makra village in Bengal where three persons were killed on Monday when alleged Trinamool Congress workers tried to recapture the village which has reportedly turned to the BJP since the Lok Sabha polls.
 
Party vice-president Mukthar Abbas Naqvi, Lok Sabha MPs Kirti Azad and Udit Raj, state party president Rahul Sinha and others allegedly tried to defy security restrictions to enter the village 200km away from Kolkata in south Bengal.
West Bengal's home department had this morning sent a fax to the BJP office in Kolkata, asking the politicians not to enter Makra and adjoining villages where Section 144, a law restricting the assembly of people, has been imposed.
 
"If the state government put half the effort they are putting in arresting us into curbing terrorism, the state of West Bengal would have been in a better condition," said Naqvi before being taken to a police station in a bus.
 
"The state government has clamped Section 144 to prevent us from entering the village. If the police allowed four of us to enter, it would not have violated the Section. The government is just trying to prevent the villagers from speaking to us and breaking its own law in the process," said Sinha.
 
"We have been stuffed in a bus. I can't even say how many of us have been arrested," said state BJP spokesperson Ritesh Tiwari over phone.
 
Hundreds of villagers protested against the police and demanded that they be allowed to speak to the BJP leaders. The BJP team came to Kolkata on Thursday morning and is supposed to go back and submit a report to party president Amit Shah.
Police released all the BJP leaders and supporters after half an hour.
 
On Wednesday, teams from the state Congress, state BJP and the Left parties were prevented from entering the village.

Composer Amit Trivedi says music is as evolutionary as life itself
Amit Trivedi’s love for music began as a kid and this love has not sought to cease till date. “It only evolves,” says the 35-year-old musician, who brought a new sound to Bollywood music with films likes Dev.D, Wake Up Sid and Ishaqzaade. This year he already has Queen up his sleeve and is now working on Bombay Velvet. In between he has come up with a Diwali single. Trivedi says he grew up listening to traditional folk “The atmosphere in my house was full of tunes. There has been no looking back when it comes to music. From folk, it went on to films and now it has got me where I am,” says Trivedi. “But I am also a complete twentieth-century boy. I love my Coldplay and Floyd and I am an A.R. Rahman fan, from the day he made Roja for us,” he elaborates.
The artist says that he remains very rooted and it has helped him grow as a musician. Trivedi, who composes for non-film albums as well, holds that with the advancement of technology, music too has its share of fair advancement. “We have our electric guitars, computers and digitalisation. If nothing else, our tracks are a lot clearer than before,” he adds.
Talking about the transition of Bollywood music, he says that Indian cinema has managed to keep the melody intact. “I do not think we have lost melody yet. The element of melody only got interesting with the passage of time, like everything else.”
He does not take the side of those who claim that Bollywood songs have lost their essence. “I think it is irrelevant when people say such things. Why can’t music be one of those things which evolve over the years? When you accept everything else as evolutionary, why not this,” he questions. “Obviously, what got made in 1960 cannot be made in 2014. Nothing can be compared to our very own S.D. Burman or R.D. Burman or Madan Mohan. But then the time now is different and so are the people creating it and I am unapologetic about this,” he reflects.
While all of this stands true, he says that in this era, it is difficult for a musician to make a mark. “There are so many people who work under one roof to compose one song. Earlier it used to be one movie which released in a month or once in two months. People would eagerly wait and watch films and remember the songs too, because cinema, essentially, was the only medium of entertainment. Now you have two to three films releasing a week. So, if one film has five songs, it will be fifteen songs a week; over fifty songs a month and thousands of songs in a year. How else are you stand out if not by being authentic,” he signs off.

US govt approves Samsung s new KNOX-based Galaxy devices for classified useSamsung's KNOX security platform based devices get NIAP validation. (Source: Samsung)
By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Posted: October 29, 2014 4:07 pm
The United States government has approved new Samsung Galaxy devices based on KNOX security platform for handling full range of classified information. According to a statement, the new National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) validated consumer mobile devices are Galaxy S4, Galaxy S5, Galaxy Note 3, Galaxy Note 4, Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014 Edition), Galaxy Note Edge, Galaxy Alpha, Galaxy Tab S 8.4 and Galaxy Tab S 10.5. The Galaxy IPSEC Virtual Private Network (VPN) Client was also added to the Commercial Solutions for Classified (CSfC) Program Component List.
“This accomplishment is the direct result of Samsung’s successful testing and certification under the U.S. government’s Common Criteria Mobile Device Fundamental Protection Profile (MDFPP) and VPN Protection Profile (VPNPP) programs. The listed Samsung devices are available for use with classified government networks and data,” said Samsung in a release.
Earlier this year Samsung mobile devices were officially included on the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Department of Defense Approved Products List for Sensitive But Unclassified use.
The CSfC list for high security solutions supplements the DISA listing, enabling the U.S. government and its contractors to create composed solutions meeting the full range of U.S. government security objectives.
Samsung claims it to be the only manufacturer with mobile devices on both lists.

Techies4Kannada, a group of musically-inclined techies are out with their second Kannada music album, going beyond borders and collaborating with the Czech Symphony Orchestra. And they are in time for Rajyothsava, with a new peppy patriotic song
What started as a bunch of IT guys deciding to form a group called Techies4Kannada to connect Kannadigas within the tech industry through music has now transformed into a large ongoing project called KChords that has embraced, among other things, educating underprivileged children, and orchestral music from the Czech Republic!
They began rather casually, after a carpool conversation in 2013, and then spreading out and working across countries from America to Australia. The team is now out with their second Kannada music album Ananya Aalaapana …Unconditionally Music, a year after their first album, Baa Sangaati… In a Journey of Love.
“The album is being released to coincide with Kannada Rajyotsava, with a high-energy new-generation Kannada patriotic song dedicated to Kannadigas around the world. It has got a strong sentiment that Kannadigas, especially those living on foreign shores, will certainly recognise and connect to,” says Mysore-based Paawana Poonacha, who has written lyrics for four of the songs on the album, and is a content architect with an IT firm.
The song, among other things, illustrates how Karnataka has richly contributed to the technological progress of our country and the world, she points out. The album has a total of seven tracks.
The team is also excited that this is the first time that the orchestra for a Kannada music album has been executed by a foreign symphony – the Czech Symphony Orchestra at Prague.
“We decided to bring in Czech music into the picture to add a global flavour to our Kannada roots,” says the album’s music composer, Karthik Somanath, a technical architect at an IT firm in Bangalore.
“We worked back and forth after explaining our needs, explained the theme, emotions, and discussed the kind of orchestration, the scales we were looking for, to align the music to what our people will connect with. Ultimately music is a universal language,” he concludes. The final recoding of the orchestra was done in Prague last month. The team in India worked late on week nights and picked up pace on weekends and the voice tracks weRe recorded in a studio here in Bangalore, says Karthik.
The seven tracks reflect the theme ‘Life is Beautiful’ and focus on what makes it beautiful, says Karthik — the songs are on friendship, love, peace, music — in the tracks titled Adhbhuta ee jeevana, Prakrutiya vismaya, Shudda layada, Huttitu hego bandhavyavu, Madhura swaragala milana, Bhuviyu Smariso, and Jagadali yelle hodaru. The album features noted singers Hemanth Kumar, Anupama M.A, Santosh, Anuradha Bhat, Shamita Malnad, and Ramesh Chandra, and newcomer Chandana Uday.
In fact their last album sold more than 2,000 copies worldwide and prompted them to set up a trust called the KChords Trust, so that all the proceeds from their album sales goes towards a social cause.
The album will be launched on November 2, at the Jnana Jyothi Auditorium at 6 p.m. For details on what they do, check www.kchords.org

considering floating its UK operationsClydesdale sets aside more for PPI
National Australia Bank is considering floating its UK operations on the stock market as part of an exit from the UK.
NAB said it was looking at all options for the future of the Clydesdale and Yorkshire banking division.
The news came as the Melbourne-based bank announced a fall in profits, due mainly to problems at its UK operation.
Chief executive Andrew Thorburn said: "We have an intention to exit the UK... What we are signalling is that's our intent, it is an absolute priority."
Together, Clydesdale Bank and Yorkshire Bank have more than 320 branches. Earlier this year NAB announced a plan to close around 30 branches and invest £45m in its UK business.
Net profit at Australia's fourth largest bank was down 1.1% to A$5.3bn (£3bn), but cash earnings, which strip out volatile items, fell 9.8% to $5.18bn in the year to September.
Mr Thorburn told reporters: "While our Australia and New Zealand franchises are in good shape, it is disappointing to record a full year result that includes $1.5bn after tax in UK conduct provisions and other impairments.
"Our clear focus is on our Australian and New Zealand franchises. In relation to exiting UK banking, this means we are now examining a broader range of options including those provided by public markets," said Mr Thorburn, who took over NAB in August.
He has already announced plans to offload the group's US operation Great Western Bank via a stock market listing.
Mis-selling
NAB also announced profit figures for Clydesdale and Yorkshire. Annual pre-tax earnings rose by 90% to £203m, helped by a 49% drop in bad debts to £80m.
Last month the bank said that redress for Payment Protection Insurance mis-selling would cost £420m for the financial year just ended. That was up from £75m announced in August.
Clydesdale is also having to set aside £250m to repay businesses which were mis-sold complex financial products intended to protect against interest rate volatility.
The company has also been hit by bad property loans.
NAB bought Scotland-based Clydesdale Bank in 1987 and Yorkshire Bank in 1990.
NAB paid £420m for Scotland-based Clydesdale Bank 1987 and around £900m for the Yorkshire business in 1990.
Market conditions may make a  flotation unlikely in the short term. Both Virgin Money and Aldermore bank have postponed planned listings recently because of volatility on the stock market.

Samsung's mobile division, its biggest business, has been struggling to maintain its dominance against rivals such as Apple, which recently released the new iPhone 6.
Its flagship Galaxy smartphone line has been losing market share to Chinese smartphone-makers Xiaomi and Lenovo,  which sell cheaper models that also have large screens and multiple features.
Samsung said market competition is "expected to further intensify".
"Although the company anticipates a demand growth for the recently launched Galaxy Note 4 and new middle-end smartphone models, uncertainty remains," the firm said in a statement.
It said the year-end surge in competitor smartphone launches "may require a potential increase in marketing expenses associated with year-end promotions".

A little irony: Dont hype to hit headlines  Jaitley advises CAGPrint
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley after the Cabinet meeting in New Delhi on Wednesday. (Source: Express photo by: Anil Sharma)
By: ENS Economic Bureau | New Delhi | Posted: October 30, 2014 3:44 am | Updated: October 30, 2014 10:08 am
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday said the government has learnt a valuable lesson on allotment of natural resources like coal and spectrum, but cautioned the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India against “sensationalising” its reports and creating an environment of “finger pointing”.
Addressing an annual conference of the CAG, Jaitley said the auditor “doesn’t have to sensationalise… he doesn’t have to get into the headlines.”
Noting that the concept of fairness in the allocation of natural resources has been introduced, he said, “The auditor also has to realise that he has a natural advantage that he is not using discretion in making a decision but is reviewing a decision that has already been taken… He has to be an active auditor but activism and restraint must be two sides of the same coin.”
Significantly, the previous UPA government had expressed concern about the CAG’s reports that had estimated huge notional losses in the allocation of 2G spectrum and coal blocks. Under former CAG Vinod Rai, the country’s supreme auditor had pegged the notional loss in the 2G spectrum allocation at Rs 1.76 lakh crore and in coal blocks allotment at Rs 1.84 lakh crore.
Jaitley stressed that instead of “sensationalising a report” and creating an environment of “finger pointing”, the auditor should scrutinise the decision-making process and have the ability to distinguish a wrong decision and a corrupt decision.
Maintaining that audit is required for good governance as it promotes accountability and transparency, Jaitley, however, said the CAG should leave guidelines for the future but not lead to a system of “finger-pointing” as it becomes very difficult to work then.
“The system has to continue to function. The CAG was earlier the Defence Secretary and he will realise that people are scared of taking a decision because it may be reviewed in future… there is a tendency to pass the buck in files,” said Jaitley.
Referring to the 2G spectrum and coal block allocation, Jaitley said the country has paid a very “heavy price” as contracts were cancelled and the power sector is in crisis. “Both in the spectrum and coal case, we have learnt that natural resources and their allocation is not the prerogative of the state. Valuable resources can’t be allotted to whoever the state wants without value being realised… we have learnt that the hard way, giving a setback to the economy,” he said.
Reacting to Jaitley’s remarks, AICC general secretary Ajay Maken said, “Look who is talking. These were the people who welcomed the CAG’s press conferences and reports to hit out at the UPA government and the Congress… During the UPA government’s tenure, the CAG released its reports at press conferences… The BJP used these reports to hit out at the UPA government, even before continued…

is predicting operating profit of 1bn for 2014Lufthansa confirms projected 2014 operating result: EUR 1 billion profit in spite of strikes
30.10.14
• Lufthansa Group posts nine-month operating profit of EUR 849 million and confirms projected full-year operating profit of EUR 1 billion • Substantial progress in reducing costs  • Service companies report encouraging results  • Group’s member airlines’ sales and distribution structures to be harmonized • Economic slowdown affects 2015 profit projections: operating profit for 2015 should be significant improvement on 2014
The Lufthansa Group remains confident of achieving its profit targets for 2014 – despite experiencing a difficult third quarter, and despite strike action eroding EUR 170 million from its earnings results. The Group expects to post an operating profit of around EUR 1 billion for the year, excluding the impact of any further strike action between now and year-end. The projection has been strengthened by favorable results for the first nine months: the Lufthansa Group achieved an operating profit of around EUR 849 million for January-to-September 2014, a EUR 186 million improvement on the same period last year. Adjusted for non-recurring restructuring and project costs, this represents an operating profit of some EUR 1 billion for the first-nine-month period. Third-quarter operating profit amounted to EUR 735 million, up EUR 145 million on the prior-year period.
“We are currently working flat out to implement our work program with its seven strategic action areas, to ensure that we remain competitive in the longer term,” says Carsten Spohr, Chairman of the Executive Board & CEO of Deutsche Lufthansa AG. “Quality, efficiency and innovation are our prime focuses here. We’re making huge investments in  quality and service for our customers; and we’re adopting new structures and innovative business models to tap into new growth opportunities and new customer groups. We’re also working further on our existing business areas, continually raising their efficiency. Lufthansa has shown time and again in the past that it can respond flexibly to the markets and their dynamic evolution and emerge all the stronger from the challenges of doing so; and I’m convinced that we’ll bring this strategy, too, to a successful conclusion.”    
The new work program unveiled by Carsten Spohr in mid-July should see the Lufthansa Group’s service companies and its new business models increase their share of total group revenues to up to 40%. A key contributor here will be the new multi-platform “WINGS” concept, which should bundle the point-to-point services of the Group’s passenger airlines and help tap and exploit new growth opportunities. 
The Passenger Airline Group, with its quality brands of Lufthansa, SWISS, Austrian Airlines and Brussels Airlines, should see its sales and distribution structures harmonized and the amalgamation of responsibilities for global corporate key accounts. The requisite technical foundations here will be laid by early 2016, by SWISS switching its Reservations, Ticketing and Inventory operations to the same systems that are used by the Group’s further member airlines. At the same time, the Group’s member airlines’ fare structures and classes should also be harmonized for short- and medium-haul routes. This will enable the Lufthansa Group to provide its customers with better flight and fare offers that incorporate all its member airlines’ services, simultaneously reducing the internal coordination involved. Adopting and maintaining a joint overall sales and distribution strategy will also strengthen the Passenger Airline Group’s position in competitive terms. Customers should feel the first benefits here as early as next year, through the substantially-enhanced combinability of member airlines’ product offers.
Business performance 
The Group’s service companies and Lufthansa Cargo posted strong results for the first nine months of the year, with four of the Group’s five business segments seeing year-on-year operating profit improvements. 
In the passenger airline segment, the costs and lost revenues caused by the pilots’ strikes weighed heavily on the nine-month operating result. “We must find solutions – in the interests of all our employees, our customers and our shareholders – that will ensure the long-term viability of our company for the decades ahead,” says Carsten Spohr here. “And we cannot afford to overlook this vital priority in our current collective labor agreement negotiations, either.”  
In addition to the strike actions and their repercussions, nine-month results for the passenger airline segment were also depressed by strong competitive pressures and associated yield declines. But, thanks to a combination of buoyant demand and flexible demand-based capacity management, traffic revenue was raised again in the third-quarter period. Seat load factors for the Group’s passenger airlines reached record highs in summer; and lower restructuring costs and lower aircraft depreciation requirements also impacted favorably on operating results.
While 2.2% fewer flights were operated in the period, the Lufthansa Group’s EUR 22.6  billion total revenue for the first nine months of 2014 was broadly unchanged from its prior-year level. The net profit for the period amounted to EUR 482 million, a year-on-year improvement of EUR 235 million.      
“Our results for the first nine months of 2014 represent a sound achievement in a difficult and highly competitive market environment, and one that enables us to confirm our current projections for the year as a whole,” says Simone Menne, Chief Officer Finance & Aviation Services of Deutsche Lufthansa AG. “When we look ahead, though, we can see that the economic slowdown and the continuing declines in our passenger yields in the face of such fierce competition will affect our operating scope in the year ahead. This is why we need to modify our projections for 2015, even though we expect it to produce an operating result that is significantly above this year’s. And in the medium term, given the high investments awaiting us, we must further improve our operating result. The need to do so, and our rising indebtedness, are clear signs to us that we must take appropriate corrective action here in the form of the structural transformations that we are currently embarking on.”   
The airlines of the Lufthansa Group are responding to the pressure on their yields, by reducing their planned capacity growth for 2015 from the original 5% to around 3% in available-seat-kilometer terms.          
Business segment results 
The Passenger Airline Group achieved an operating profit of EUR 473 million (down EUR 41 million) for the January-to-September period. Lufthansa German Airlines contributed EUR 260 million (down EUR 56 million) to this, with its still-profitable European operations also playing their part. Germanwings, which will take over Lufthansa’s last remaining European point-to-point service – Düsseldorf-Zurich – on 8 January, also remains confident of posting an operating profit for 2015. Lufthansa’s year-on-year operating profit decline is attributable to falling yields and to the financial damage caused by the pilots’ strikes. To enhance profitability, the Lufthansa Group currently envisages a fleet modernization that will keep its aircraft numbers broadly at their present level in 2015. SWISS achieved a nine-month operating profit of EUR 217 million (up EUR 35 million). Austrian Airlines reported an operating loss of EUR 7 million (down EUR 26 million). The year-on-year decline here is also connected with the costs of the planned new collective labor agreement for Austrian’s ground and flying personnel, which, while entailing extra expense, will also give the company more positive longer-term prospects and perspectives. The Group’s airlines all benefited substantially from the revised groupwide depreciation policy, which added an aggregate EUR 260 million to their operating results for the first nine months of the year.   
Lufthansa Technik achieved a sizeable EUR 335 million operating profit (up EUR 3 million), LSG SkyChefs reported a profit of EUR 66 million (up EUR 3 million) and Lufthansa Systems posted a profit of EUR 21 million (up EUR 4 million). The Logistics business segment also raised its nine-month operating profit EUR 6 million to EUR 51 million, not least through the absence this year of the factors which had depressed its 2013 results.   
The first nine months in figures 
The Lufthansa Group’s total revenue for the first nine months of 2014 amounted to EUR 22.6 billion, a 0.6% decline on the same period last year. Total operating income also declined 0.6%, to EUR 24.2 billion. At the same time, total operating expenditure for the first nine months was reduced by a more substantial 1.9% to EUR 23.3 billion. Fuel costs for the period declined by EUR 269 million or 4.9% to EUR 5.2 billion. The figure includes a EUR 53 million loss from fuel price hedging activities. Fees and charges were 1.4% above their prior-year level.
The Lufthansa Group achieved an operating profit of EUR 849 million for the first nine months of 2014. The net result for the period amounted to EUR 482 million, a EUR 235 million improvement on the same period last year. Nine-month earnings per share rose from the EUR 0.54 of 2013 to EUR 1.05.
The Lufthansa Group increased its investments in modernizing and maintaining its aircraft fleet to EUR 1.9 billion in the first-nine-month period. All in all, the Group invested EUR 2.2 billion, some EUR 339 million more than in the same period last year. Cash flow from operating activities totaled EUR 2.1 billion, while free cash flow (operating cash flow less net capital expenditure) amounted to EUR 229 million. Net debt stood at EUR 2.3 billion at the end of the third-quarter period, up EUR 567 million on its level at the end of 2013. The balance sheet equity ratio amounted to 15.2%, down 5.8 percentage points from the end of last year.
The interim report for the first nine months of 2014 will be available on the www.lufthansagroup.com/investor-relations website from 07:30 CET on Thursday 30 October. The corresponding webcast for media and analysts will be broadcast on the same day from 09:30 CET via the following link: www.lufthansagroup.com/investor-relations

WhatsApp founders own Facebook shares worth $9 bnWhatsApp founders own Facebook shares worth nearly USD 9 bn
Associated Press     San Francisco   Last Updated: October 30, 2014  | 13:44 IST

WhatsApp founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton received 116 million shares of Facebook stock currently worth nearly $9 billion when they sold their messaging service to the social networking leader earlier this month.
The breakdown of the big winners in Facebook Inc's $22 billion acquisition emerged on Wednesday in a regulatory filing.
Koum, a Ukraine immigrant who was once living on welfare, reaped the biggest jackpot with 76.4 million Facebook shares now worth $5.8 billion. That makes him Facebook's fourth largest stockholder behind company CEO Mark Zuckerberg and two mutual funds, Fidelity Management and Vanguard.
Acton, who worked with Koum when they were both Yahoo Inc engineers, owns 39.7 million Facebook shares worth $3 billion.
More than 45 other WhatsApp current and former employees also received Facebook stock. Wednesday's filing didn't specify how many shares most of the other employees received.
Besides the Facebook stock, Koum and Acton also were paid a large chunk of the $4.6 billion in cash that was included in the WhatsApp acquisition. The amount of cash that the WhatsApp founders received hasn't been disclosed.
Both Koum, 38, and Acton, 42, rank among the 200 richest people in the US, according to Forbes' rankings.
Koum remains WhatsApp's CEO and also sits on Facebook's board of directors. He is being paid an annual salary of just $1, but will receive an additional 24.9 million shares of Facebook stock that will vest during the next four years.
That restricted stock is currently worth about $1.9 billion. Although WhatsApp ranks among the world's most popular messaging apps, it hasn't turned a profit yet. The service lost $232.5 million on revenue of just $15 million during the first six months of this year, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
WhatsApp's revenue primarily comes from an annual subscription fee of 99 cents that kicks in after one year of free service.
Zuckerberg hasn't spelled out how WhatsApp will make money yet, a sign that Facebook intends to subsidize the service while it tries to expand its reach beyond its current 500 million users.
Some investors are worried about Facebook's rising costs to pay for the development of new services and employees picked up in acquisitions.
Facebook expects its expenses to rise by as much as 75 per cent next year, a rate that might outpace its revenue growth. That prospect rattled investors, causing Facebook's stock to shed $4.91, or 6 per cent, to at $75.86 Thursday.

accept trainee pilots with no flying experienceVirgin Atlantic is to accept trainee pilots with no flying experience, the airline has announced.
The firm has launched an 18-month training programme in conjunction with Southampton-based CTC Aviation.
The six chosen candidates must pay a £109,000 bond to CTC, which will be repaid to them when they start work.
Virgin said it would act as a guarantor for loans to some trainees to encourage applicants from lower income backgrounds.
A Virgin Atlantic spokeswoman said: "As this is a brand new scheme, all cases will be assessed on an individual basis.
"The airline will have some capacity to guarantee the loans if required. We're currently working towards guaranteeing the loan for all eligible applicants in the future."
The initial course of six recruits will undergo pre-flight training, flight deck simulation at CTC's Southampton centre and flight training in Phoenix, Arizona.
'Virgin family'
The £109,000 security bond is paid back to the newly qualified pilots over their first seven years flying with Virgin.
The CTC webpage on the scheme was not available on Thursday afternoon, with the company blaming "exceptionally high demand".
The course leads to the Civil Aviation Authority's multi-pilot licence and a position as a Virgin Atlantic co-pilot on Airbus A330-300 aircraft.
Virgin's flight operations general manager David Kistruck said: "They'll be part of the Virgin family from day one and will enjoy an opportunity like no other, as the only trainee pilots in Europe to fly straight on to long-haul aircraft once qualified."
Applicants are required to have a minimum of five GCSEs or equivalent including maths, science and English.
Earlier this month, Virgin Atlantic announced that from next year it would stop running Little Red, its UK flight network launched in 2013.
The flights between London Heathrow and Manchester will stop in March, while those between Heathrow and Edinburgh and Aberdeen will end in September.

ACC Ltd clocks 62% rise Q2 net profitACC Ltd clocks 62% rise in net profit in Q2
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: October 30, 2014  | 17:46 IST
Cement manufacturer ACC Ltd on Thursday reported a whopping 62 per cent rise in its consolidated net profit for July-September quarter at Rs 192.60 crore on better cost management and improved realisations.
The company, which follows January-December as accounting year in line with its majority stakeholder Holcim, had reported Rs 118.90 crore net profit in the same quarter last year.
"Profitability during the quarter showed an improvement as a result of our customer excellence programme and better cost management, particularly with regard to distribution costs and optimised sourcing of inputs and improved realisations," ACC Ltd said in a statement.
Turnover of the company, with prospects of economy gradually picking up leaving a positive impact on cement demand, rose to 2,741.87 crore from Rs 2,505.44 crore during the same quarter a year earlier.
Sales volume increased though marginally to 5.62 million tonnes (MT) during the July-September quarter of the current year compared to 5.54 MT during the same quarter last year.
Operating EBITDA rose to Rs 379 crore against Rs 286.56 crore in the same period of the previous year, it said.
"With prospects of the economy gradually picking up, the infrastructure, housing and construction sectors are expected to register growth in the near term which will have a positive impact on demand for cement," ACC Ltd said.
The company said its subsidiary ACC Mineral Resources had participated in four 49:51 joint ventures with Madhya Pradesh State Mining Corporation (MPSMCL) for development and mining of four coal blocks allocated to MPSMCL.
These blocks now stand cancelled following cancellation of blocks by the Supreme Court last month. ACC Ltd said the financial loss or operational impact as a result, if any, would not be significant.

Asian stocks were mixedAsian stocks were mixed after the Federal Reserve said it was ending its quantitative easing stimulus programme because of the stronger US economy.
The US central bank also said it would maintain record-low interest rates for "a considerable time".
However, other Fed comments on the state of the US jobs market were seen as bringing a future rate rise forward.
This caused the US dollar to jump to a three-week high against the yen, spurring a rise in Japan stocks.
The benchmark Nikkei 225 closed up 0.7% at 15,658.20 while the broader Topix ended 0.65% higher at 1,278.90.
In Australia, the ASX 200 rose 0.5% to 5,476.20.
New Zealand's NZX 50 stock index hit a record high of 5,381.71 at one point before closing 0.3% higher at 5,370.18. The country's central bank left interest rates at a near six-year high of 3.5% on Thursday.
However, Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed down 0.5% at 23,702.04 after an increase in bad loans at some of China's biggest banks weighed on financial stocks.
"While the ending of US QE could contribute more volatility to shares it has largely been anticipated," Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP Capital said.
"With the US likely to continue growing and monetary conditions expected to remain easy for some time to come the cyclical bull market in shares likely has further to go."
Investors will now be looking ahead to the US economy's latest growth report out later on Thursday and the Bank of Japan's monetary policy decision on Friday.

Samsung Electronics, the world's largest smartphone-maker, saw its shares rise 4.5% despite a sharp drop in quarterly profits after it lost market share to cheaper Chinese rivals.
Shares in Nintendo rose more than 7% at first after the gaming company reported better-than-expected profits. However, the shares then fell back to close up 1%.
However, Yahoo Japan and Mitsubishi Motors failed to impress with their results. Both firms saw their shares fall by 5.6% and 3.8% respectively.
South Korea's top internet portal operator Naver fell by more than 3% after its profit results came in slightly short of estimates.
In Singapore, construction firm Yongnam Holdings surged 20% on news it was part of a consortium that won a $1.5bn contract to build a second international airport in Myanmar.

transcripts of chats by "The Sterling Lads"Sterling Lads' Chats Show FX Traders Matching Fix Orders

“Any fix quid?” a currency trader at Barclays Plc (BARC) asked a counterpart at HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) at 2:25 p.m. on June 23, 2011. “Get 50 cable on fix,” he said as he tried to sell British pounds.
“Nothing as of yet mate,” replied the HSBC trader, according to a transcript of the “Sterling Lads” instant-message group provided to Bloomberg News by a person with knowledge of a global investigation into alleged currency-rate rigging . “I hope not either, as everything I touched today has cost me money. I just lost 10k there typing.”
Opaque conversations such as this are at the heart of the probe into allegations that traders at some of the largest banks used instant-message groups to share information about their positions and client orders to rig benchmarks used by pension-fund managers. Authorities also are weighing whether traders used groups like Sterling Lads, and others with names such as “The Cartel” and “The Bandits’ Club,” to break rules in their discussions with counterparts at other banks.
Broken Benchmarks
Currency “sales people and traders by and large react and perform around exchanges of information,” said Stuart Murdoch, a litigation consultant at Turing Capital LLP in London and former foreign-exchange trader. The question is whether these exchanges “have actually gone beyond what would be deemed reasonable in terms of imparting details of client behavior around order execution and price action.”

FX Speak
The Sterling Lads messages are full of casual banter, British slang and the lingua franca of foreign-exchange traders, with pounds or cash referred to as quid and the amount of U.K. currency -- sterling -- to be swapped for dollars called cable.
Traders were open about using such message groups to match orders, telling authorities including the Bank of England that they help avoid losses in the hours before the benchmark is set, reduce volatility and get a better price for their clients, people familiar with those discussions have said.
Investigators in the U.S., Europe and Asia are poring over thousands of pages of transcripts like these looking for evidence of collusion to rig currency rates, trading ahead of clients and other possible wrongdoing. Spokesmen for Barclays and HSBC, both based in London, declined to comment about the Sterling Lads chats.
A minute after the Barclays trader’s request to sell 50 million pounds ($81 million) in exchange for dollars, the HSBC trader typed, “I can match. 50 quid.”
‘Fook Off’
The Barclays trader came right back with “Ta,” an informal way to say thanks.
“Rhx in about 50 quid at the fix,” the HSBC trader responded, probably a typo for rhs, or right-hand side, a term meaning he would buy the pounds at the 4 p.m. WM/Reuters rate. The benchmark is based on trades in a minute-long period starting 30 seconds before 4 p.m. in London.
“I let u know if i get any more,” the Barclays employee typed. “Can do 58 all day.”
After his counterpart said he’d do it, the Barclays trader wrote “actually 59 if ok,” indicating he wanted to sell as much as 59 million pounds.
“Fook off,” the HSBC trader wrote back.
“59 done thks u helm,” the Barclays trader said, signing off with a slangy British epithet.
Bloomberg News reviewed the transcript of a conversation that spanned about 40 minutes on the condition that neither the traders nor clients named in them would be identified. Another dealer from Barclays and two from Zurich-based UBS AG (UBSN) were logged onto the thread at various points during the chat. The exchanges are the sort of discussions banks are trying to end by banning group chats involving employees at other companies.
Dominik von Arx, a spokesman for UBS, declined to comment.
Gray Area
All three banks have said they are cooperating with investigations. They’re among several firms in settlement talks with regulators as authorities around the world look into allegations surrounding the $5.3 trillion-a-day currency market . U.S. and U.K. deals could be announced as soon as next month.
U.K. banks could be in breach of the Financial Conduct Authority’s Principles, a list of 11 standards for how regulated companies should behave, one lawyer said, asking not to be identified because his firm is representing a bank under investigation. Many traders are in roles requiring them to be approved by the FCA, putting them at risk of being penalized for violating those guidelines as well, the lawyer said.
The principles are broadly written, mandating firms do “business with integrity” and “observe proper standards of market conduct.” Individuals are required to do the same.
Lara Joseph, an FCA spokeswoman, declined to comment.
How client and order information “is conveyed has very much been coordinated around unwritten rules of conduct,” Turing Capital’s Murdoch said. While “much of this may sit within a gray area, some may end up being categorized as falling outside of the banks’ internal guidelines and what regulators would have expected.”

Microsoft watch beats Apple to marketMicrosoft watch beats Apple to market

Microsoft
Microsoft (MSFT) is showing consumers and Wall Street it still has tricks up its sleeve by launching its smartwatch now, beating Apple (AAPL) to the market for the critical holiday season.
A Microsoft-branded smartwatch has been rumored for months — but the company late Wednesday announced the “Microsoft Band” watch is now available for order for $199.
Several online app stores, including the store for apps for Apple’s Mac and Microsoft’s Windows Phone , showed listings for an app called “Microsoft Health.” The app extracts data collected by the newly announced watch. The Microsoft Store posted on its Facebook page it is sponsoring a fitness event in stores Thursday, presumably to promote the device.
The listing for the app says it will be available for all three major smartphone platforms, including Apple’s iOS, Google’s Android and Microsoft’s Windows Phone. This makes the device very different than other smartphone makers’ wearable devices, which are tethered to just their equipment. Microsoft is making the bet that modern consumers have devices made by multiple companies and are looking for equipment and services that work on all of them.
In addition to being a timepiece, the Microsoft Band will offer health-related functions such as 24-hour heart monitoring, GPS distance measurement, step counting, calorie counting and sleep monitoring. The Microsoft Band app will also show the user a graph of their sleep, displaying how much was restful, light and how many times the user was woken up – indicating it’s designed to be worn overnight. The watch will also measure UV light exposure.
Windows Phone store
But the Microsoft Band packs productivity features, too, making it different than some limited-function sport bands. The Microsoft Band allows users to check stock quotes, view previews of e-mails and upcoming calendar appointments and access to Twitter, Facebook and text messages. The watch can also be used for mobile payments at Starbucks . The Windows Phone version of the app says the Band features Cortana, Microsoft’s voice assistant, which can be used to set appointments and reminders by voice command. The watch also will have a charge that last two days, much better than other smartwatches that mostly need to be recharged nightly.
Investors will closely watch the Microsoft Watch since it’s the latest big hardware push from the Redmond, Wash.-based company since the debut of its successful Surface Pro 3 tablet computer months ago. Microsoft’s Surface business appears to be on the verge of being close to a billion dollar in revenue business. Microsoft’s future with hardware will be a key to accessing its market value going forward, says Norman Young, analyst at Morningstar in a note to clients .
Shares of Microsoft are up 35% this year as investors see Microsoft making a stronger push to win back consumers lost as competing mobile platforms have caught on. Consumer businesses remain a very small part of Microsoft. Microsoft’s consumer-focused products, Xbox and Windows Phone, account for just 0.5% of the company’s stock price and about 11% of revenue, stock-research system Trefis says. Shares closed Thursday up 13 cents to $46.62.
Microsoft’s smartwatch is also a showcase of the tech company’s key differentiating factor when dealing with the consumer: the watch will function with all three of the major smartphone platforms.  It’s also a sign of the company’s push to increase the speed at which it gets consumer products to market. Apple’s watch, in contrast, will only work with Apple’s own smartphones and won’t be released until next year and for $350. It’s widely believed Apple’s watch will need to be recharged daily.
This is just the latest in what’s been a long history of Microsoft and watches. Back in 1994, Microsoft launched the DataLink line of watches that were a hit with watch enthusiasts, programmers and was even certified for space travel by NASA. The DataLink allowed users to transfer contact and schedule data wirelessly by holding the watch in front of a computer monitor. That original DataLink watch was followed in 2003 with a version of the DataLink co-developed with Timex to be a rugged sportwatch, called the Timex Datalink USB. Many developers wrote apps that ran on the watch. More recently, Microsoft launched in 2004 SPOT watches that used radio technology to provide one-way data feeds.
The Band is the latest attempt by Microsoft to move technology to the wrist. Shares are down Thursday 70 cents, or 1.5%, to $45.93 amid weakness in tech stocks.

BJP trying to create unrest in WB: Trinamool CongressBy: Press Trust of India | Kolkata | Posted: October 30, 2014 4:43 pm
The ruling Trinamool Congress on Thursday accused BJP of trying to create unrest in West Bengal on the basis of religion, soon after some central leaders of the saffron outfit were arrested for trying to enter the violence- hit Makra village in Birbhum district.
“No one is above law even if one is a member of Parliament,” TMC general secretary and MP Mukul Roy said, justifying the arrest of BJP leaders, including its vice president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and MPs Kirti Azad and Udit Raj.
Police said the BJP leaders were arrested as they tried to enter the village violating prohibitory orders under CrPC Section 144 clamped after the October 27 clash between TMC and BJP activists, in which three persons were killed and at least five houses were set on fire.
Roy said, “BJP is trying to create unrest in the state on the basis of religion and to stall the development works being carried out by the Mamata Banerjee government for the common
people.”
“There is no place for communalism in West Bengal and the people of the state would resist the BJP’s attempts in this regard. Not only in Makra village, the BJP is trying to create unrest in entire West Bengal,” he said, adding the saffron outfit is trying to divide the people of Bengal and tarnish the image of the state.

Narendra Modi govt bars first class travel  five-star hotel meetings for officialsPrint

Unveiling an austerity drive to cut non-plan expenditure by 10 per cent, the Narendra Modi government has barred bureaucrats from travelling first class on overseas visits and have been asked to use video conferencing as much as possible.
With an aim to restrict fiscal deficit to 4.1 per cent of GDP in 2014-15, the Finance Ministry has barred officials from holding meetings in five-star hotels and put a freeze on fresh appointments and filling up posts lying vacant for over one year.
“While officers are entitled to various classes of air travel depending on seniority, utmost economy would need to be observed while exercising the choice keeping the limitations of budget in mind. However, there would no bookings in the first class,” said the office memorandum.
The facility of Video Conferencing, it said, “may be used effectively”.
The Finance Ministry said purchase of new vehicles to meet operational requirement of defence forces, Paramilitary forces and security organisations are permitted but ban on purchase of any other vehicles would continue.
“Such measures are intended at promoting fiscal discipline, without restricting the operational efficiency of the government. In the context of the current fiscal situation, there is a need to continue to rationalise expenditure and optimise available resources,” it said.
The government proposes to lower the fiscal deficit to 3 per cent of GDP by 2016-17. The deficit which had touched a high of 5.7 per cent in 2011-12, was brought down to 4.8 per cent in 2012-13 and further to 4.5 per cent in 2013-14 by way of austerity measures.
“The task before me is very challenging because we need to revive growth, particularly in manufacturing sector and infrastructure,” Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said in his budget speech. He added that choice has to be made whether or not to be victims of mere populism and wasteful expenditure.
The Finance Ministry said that the “mandatory 10 per cent cut” in plan expenditure will exclude interest payments, repayment of debt, defence, capital, salaries, pensions and grants to the state.
“No re-appropriation of funds to augment the non-plan heads of expenditure on which cuts have been imposed, shall be allowed during the current fiscal,” it said.
It said the austerity measures would also apply to autonomous bodies, adding that no fresh commitments would be made over and above what was provided in the Budget.
Only seminars and conferences that are absolutely  essential should be organised, it said, adding that “holding of exhibitions/seminars/conferences abroad is strongly discouraged except in case of exhibitions for trade promotions.”
It said in all cases of air travel the lowest air fare tickets available for entitled class are to be purchased. “No companion free ticket on domestic/international travel is to be availed of,” it added.
Referring to jobs in government departments, it said there will be a total ban on new posts and those that have remained vacant for more than a year will not be filled except “under very rare and unavoidable circumstances”.
The Finance Ministry has also asked the departments to avoid bunching up expenditure in the last quarter to ensure that there is continued…

Vaiko is a long-time friend  says Karunanidhistate politics
Participating in the wedding of the grand-daughter of PMK founder-leader S. Ramadoss, the DMK chief said he and Ramadoss shared mutual affection.
DMK leader M. Karunanidhi on Thursday said he would be happy if the meeting between party treasurer M.K. Stalin and MDMK general secretary Vaiko was the beginning of the formation of an alliance in the State for the 2016 Assembly election.
Mr. Stalin met Mr. Vaiko at the reception of former Union Minister Anbumani Ramadoss’s daughter Samyukta at Mahabalipuram on Wednesday.
Mr. Karunanidhi, who attended the marriage on Thursday, said he would happily welcome if a new alliance was formed and the DMK’s general council and executive council approved the same. Besides Mr. Vakio, senior BJP leaders including Union Minister Pon. Radhakrishnan and L. Ganesan attended the wedding.
Mr. Karunanidhi said he was also ready to meet Mr. Vaiko, as he and the MDMK leader were long-time friends. “We are not enemies,” he added.
Asked about PMK founder S. Ramadoss’s remarks about how he had cherished the DMK chief’s friendship, Mr. Karunanidhi said he was filled with happiness.
To a question whether these meetings could be construed as a prelude to an alliance since elections are 18 months away, Mr. Karunanidhi said, “You can come to your own conclusion.”
“I am happy with the developments,” he said.
Earlier, addressing the gathering at the marriage, Mr. Karunanidhi said the mutual love and affection he and Dr. Ramadoss had for each other remained unaffected by differences of opinion and fissures.
“That was why I asked Mr. Stalin to attend the reception on Wednesday, as I am not doing well for the last couple of days,” he said.
Mr. Karunanidhi also expressed happiness over the marriage that followed the tradition of self-respect espoused by Dravidian Movement founder Periyar and DMK founder C.N. Annadurai.

The court adjourned till November 11 hearing on AAP petition seeking dissolution of the assembly and holding of fresh elections.
The Supreme Court on Thursday expressed satisfaction over Lt Governor Najeeb Jung’s recent moves to explore the possibility of government formation in Delhi and said that he should be given more time as “there could be a minority government with outside support“.
Referring to recent media reports, a five-judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice H L Dattu said,“Whatever I have read in newspapers, it appears that the LG has made positive moves.”
The bench asked Prashant Bhushan, counsel for Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) which has filed a plea seeking dissolution of the Assembly, to wait for sometime as the LG had started the consultation process with the political players in the national capital and adjourned the matter till November 11.
During the brief hearing, the bench also comprising justices J Chelameswar, A K Sikri, R K Agrawal and Arun Mishra, said that if the LG feels that there is a possibility of government formation, then he should be given time to explore it.
On the possibility of government formation, the bench said, “There could be a minority government with an outside support of some political outfit.”
Mr. Bhushan, however, said that there was no possibility of government formation in the national capital in view of the position of political parties in the legislative assembly.
“We should always live in hope,” the bench said asking the counsel for AAP to wait till November 11 when it will again hear the matter.
The L-G had on Wednesday decided to invite political parties to explore possibility of government formation in Delhi.
Earlier, the apex court was informed by the Centre that the President has given his consent to LG’s proposal to invite BJP to form government.
The court had also rapped the Centre and the L-G over the delay , saying that in a democracy, President’s Rule cannot go on forever and questioned why the authorities failed to act expeditiously.
At the moment, a party needs the support of 34 MLAs for a simple majority in a House of 70 with three vacancies which are to be filled in by—elections late next month.
BJP had emerged the single largest party after the Assembly polls in December last year with 31 seats apart from the support of ally Akali Dal’s one MLA in the 70—member House. But its numbers have now come down to 28 after three of its legislators——Harsh Vardhan, Ramesh Bidhuri and Pervesh Verma——were elected to Lok Sabha.

Writing in Bloomberg BusinessweekOctober 30, 2014
Photograph by Ashley Gilbertson for Bloomberg Businessweek
Throughout my professional life, I’ve tried to maintain a basic level of privacy. I come from humble roots, and I don’t seek to draw attention to myself. Apple is already one of the most closely watched companies in the world, and I like keeping the focus on our products and the incredible things our customers achieve with them.
At the same time, I believe deeply in the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, who said: “Life’s most persistent and urgent question is, ‘What are you doing for others?’ ” I often challenge myself with that question, and I’ve come to realize that my desire for personal privacy has been holding me back from doing something more important. That’s what has led me to today.
For years, I’ve been open with many people about my sexual orientation. Plenty of colleagues at Apple know I’m gay, and it doesn’t seem to make a difference in the way they treat me. Of course, I’ve had the good fortune to work at a company that loves creativity and innovation and knows it can only flourish when you embrace people’s differences. Not everyone is so lucky.
While I have never denied my sexuality, I haven’t publicly acknowledged it either, until now. So let me be clear: I’m proud to be gay, and I consider being gay among the greatest gifts God has given me.
Being gay has given me a deeper understanding of what it means to be in the minority and provided a window into the challenges that people in other minority groups deal with every day. It’s made me more empathetic, which has led to a richer life. It’s been tough and uncomfortable at times, but it has given me the confidence to be myself, to follow my own path, and to rise above adversity and bigotry. It’s also given me the skin of a rhinoceros, which comes in handy when you’re the CEO of Apple.
The world has changed so much since I was a kid. America is moving toward marriage equality, and the public figures who have bravely come out have helped change perceptions and made our culture more tolerant. Still, there are laws on the books in a majority of states that allow employers to fire people based solely on their sexual orientation. There are many places where landlords can evict tenants for being gay, or where we can be barred from visiting sick partners and sharing in their legacies. Countless people, particularly kids, face fear and abuse every day because of their sexual orientation.
I don’t consider myself an activist, but I realize how much I’ve benefited from the sacrifice of others. So if hearing that the CEO of Apple is gay can help someone struggling to come to terms with who he or she is, or bring comfort to anyone who feels alone, or inspire people to insist on their equality, then it’s worth the trade-off with my own privacy.
I’ll admit that this wasn’t an easy choice. Privacy remains important to me, and I’d like to hold on to a small amount of it. I’ve made Apple my life’s work, and I will continue to spend virtually all of my waking time focused on being the best CEO I can be. That’s what our employees deserve—and our customers, developers, shareholders, and supplier partners deserve it, too. Part of social progress is understanding that a person is not defined only by one’s sexuality, race, or gender. I’m an engineer, an uncle, a nature lover, a fitness nut, a son of the South, a sports fanatic, and many other things. I hope that people will respect my desire to focus on the things I’m best suited for and the work that brings me joy.
The company I am so fortunate to lead has long advocated for human rights and equality for all. We’ve taken a strong stand in support of a workplace equality bill before Congress, just as we stood for marriage equality in our home state of California. And we spoke up in Arizona when that state’s legislature passed a discriminatory bill targeting the gay community. We’ll continue to fight for our values, and I believe that any CEO of this incredible company, regardless of race, gender, or sexual orientation, would do the same. And I will personally continue to advocate for equality for all people until my toes point up.
When I arrive in my office each morning, I’m greeted by framed photos of Dr. King and Robert F. Kennedy. I don’t pretend that writing this puts me in their league. All it does is allow me to look at those pictures and know that I’m doing my part, however small, to help others. We pave the sunlit path toward justice together, brick by brick. This is my brick.
Tim Cook is the CEO of Apple.

Sodastream pulls out of West Bank
Israeli drinks company Sodastream is to move a factory out of the West Bank    amid calls from Palestinian activists for a boycott

Comments
Sodastream is to move one of    its factories out of a West Bank settlement amid calls from pro-Palestinian    activists to boycott the soft drinks company.
The Israeli group, which sells its fizzy drinks maker in 45 countries, will    relocate the facility to Lehavim in Israel's southern Negev region next    year, it said on Wednesday.
The company denied the move was instigated by protests over territory in the    Middle East, saying it was a "purely commercial" decision and is    part of a "global growth plan".
The new location, which has been handed a $20m grant from the Israeli    government, "will become our flagship manufacturing site and is    expected to deliver operational excellence and result in savings of 2pc    across our entire cost base", a spokeswoman said.
The Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions National Committee welcomed    the move.

Actress quits Oxfam over West Bank row
30 Jan 2014
Sodastream has come under fire for its factory    on the West Bank , a territory captured by Israel in 1967 and claimed    by the Palestinians.
The plant employs roughly 500 Palestinians from the Occupied West Bank and    East Jerusalem, as well as 450 Arab Israelis and 350 Jewish Israelis.
SodaStream’s chief executive, Daniel Birnbaum, has previously said he would “never” have built the plant there in the first place had he known the    controversy it might attract. But despite it being a “pain the ass”, he said    in January that he had no intentions to shut it.
“We will not throw our employees under the bus to promote anyone’s political    agenda,” he said.
Yonah Lloyd, president of SodaStream, has described the atmosphere in the    plant as “very harmonious”.
“We believe what we’ve accomplished by bringing together all kinds of people    to work together, break bread together at lunch, and at company events at    the beach, is a dream,” he told The Telegraph earlier this year.
Hollywood actress Scarlett Johansson was dragged into the row after agreeing    to become Sodastream's first global brand ambassador, appearing in an advert    for the soda maker during the Super Bowl on February 2.
The star cut    ties with Oxfam after criticism of her Sodastream role, saying there    had been "a fundamental difference of opinion". Oxfam    International opposes all trade from Israeli settlements, saying they are    illegal and deny Palestinian rights.
Scarlett Johansson's Sodastream advert
"Scarlett Johansson has respectfully decided to end her ambassador role    with Oxfam after eight years," a statement at the time said. "She    and Oxfam have a fundamental difference of opinion in regards to the    boycott, divestment and sanctions movement. She is very proud of her    accomplishments and fundraising efforts during her tenure with Oxfam."
Ms Johansson said she was a "supporter of economic cooperation and social    interaction between a democratic Israel and Palestine".
In an interview with Dazed magazine, she did not directly address the row, but    said: " I    don’t see myself as being a role model .
"How could I wake up every day and be a normal person if I was completely    aware that my image was being manipulated on a global platform. How could I    sleep?
"You have to have peace of mind. You’ve got to be able to protect those    things. How else could you exist? You'd go crazy, anybody would go crazy."
 

Airtel Q2 net profit rises three-fold to Rs 1 383 crBharti Airtel Q2 net profit rises three-fold to Rs 1,383 cr on mobile data revenue
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: October 30, 2014  | 17:58 IST
Bharti Airtel, country's largest mobile operator , on Thursday reported nearly three-fold jump in consolidated net profit to Rs 1,383 crore for the second quarter ended September 30, 2014 on the back of higher mobile data revenue.
The company had reported a net profit of Rs 512 crore in the corresponding period of last fiscal, it said in a statement.
The company's total revenue rose 7.1 per cent to Rs 22,845 crore for the reported quarter as compared to Rs 21,324 crore in the corresponding period.
"Consolidated mobile data revenues at Rs 2,540 crore grew by 66.7 per cent year-on-year, contributing more than two- thirds of the incremental revenues," Airtel said in a statement.
Airtel said for India, mobile data revenue registered a growth of 73.8 per cent y-o-y at Rs 1,805 crore, helped by increase in data customer base and higher usage per customer. Mobile data revenues now contribute to 14.5 per cent of mobile India revenues.
"We continue to see strong momentum in mobile data which has grown by 74 per cent in this quarter. Airtel's pioneering 4G roll-out in 15 cities is now witnessing stronger customer acceptance," Bharti Airtel MD and CEO (India & South Asia) Gopal Vittal said.
On the regulatory front, he said the recent TRAI recommendations on making more contiguous spectrum available in the upcoming auctions have the potential of transforming the industry.
Africa revenues grew by 6.4 per cent in local currency terms, but the dollar appreciation depressed the reported growth to 1.9 per cent Y-o-Y, Airtel said.
Data revenues for Africa stood at $115 million with growth of 56.8 per cent and data revenues now contribute to 10.1 per cent of overall Africa revenues.
"Our robust 3G networks have supported the doubling of data volumes Y-o-Y, and we have been gearing up for much more growth. Airtel money transaction values have also crossed $1 billion a month," Bharti Airtel MD and CEO (Africa) Christian de Faria said.
The net debt of the company increased to Rs 62,215.8 crore due to an addition of Rs 6,445 crore of deferred payment liabilities for the 2G spectrum.

Shiv Sena ministers unlikely to join govt in Maharashtra tomorrowPrint
Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray is likely to hold discussions with senior leaders again this evening and announce the party's stand on joining the government.
Written by Zeeshan Shaikh , Shubhangi Khapre | Mumbai | Posted: October 30, 2014 5:01 pm | Updated: October 31, 2014 9:58 am
Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray and his party MLAs seem to have made up their mind not to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Chief Minister-designate Devendra Fadnavis and his cabinet on Friday. The Sena leadership looks inclined towards sitting in the Opposition than being a part of the government. On the other hand, the BJP said it was confident of facing the vote of confidence on the floor of the House even without the support of Shiv Sena and NCP.

“If we are being humiliated, what is the point of going to the swearing-in ceremony. The humiliation meted out by the BJP has not gone down well with our MLAs,” said senior Sena leader and MP Vinayak Raut.
The party leadership is learnt to have called up all its MLAs and asked them to refrain from attending the swearing-in ceremony. The Sena had been insisting that it should be given a third of the cabinet berths in the new government, but the BJP is not inclined to accommodate the Sena’s demands.
Fadnavis had Wednesday extended invitation to Uddhav Thackeray and his wife Rashmi, and Sena leaders had assured that they would attend the ceremony. The Sena had claimed that it would take a final decision on joining the government after a meeting of its leaders on Thursday. It had also tried to placate the BJP through an editorial in party mouthpiece Saamana, saying it welcomed the new government but the BJP should not ally with the NCP. It also stated that running a minority government was not constitutionally permissible.

The Sena was hoping that as the day progressed the BJP would accommodate its demands. However, after a tweet by senior BJP leader Rajeev Pratap Rudy that even though discussions were on with the Sena it seemed unlikely that Sena members would be sworn in on Friday, the Sena decided to call off its internal meeting and boycott the function.

Talking to The Indian Express later, Rudy said: “We are ruling out alliance with the Shiv Sena tomorrow. However, we have a cordial equations and talks are still going on.”
Fadnavis will be sworn in along with a small team of cabinet ministers. Party insiders indicated that Friday would be a “100 per cent BJP show”.
A miffed Sena leadership said party chief Uddhav Thackeray would take a final call on what the party planned to do. Sena leaders said the top brass seemed to have made up its mind to sit in the Opposition.

5 Indian fishermen sentenced to death by Sri Lankan courtPrint
By: Press Trust of India | Colombo/new Delhi | Posted: October 30, 2014 4:57 pm
Five Indian fishermen were given death penalty by a Sri Lankan court on Thursday for alleged drug trafficking, prompting a response from India that it will appeal to a higher court against the judgement.
The five fishermen, all hailing from Tamil Nadu, were apprehended in 2011 by the Sri Lankan Navy on charges of smuggling of drugs, official sources said.
The five Indians are among a group of eight people sentenced to death by the high court in Colombo. They had been arrested on a boat in the seas off northern Jaffna’s Delft islet.
The High Court judge Preethi Padman Surasena passed judgement on the five Indians and three Sri Lankans for involvement in heroin trafficking between India and Sri Lanka in 2011.
However, the Indian government, which has been pursuing their case for the last four years, maintains that it has done due diligence and found them to be innocent.
Immediately reacting to the Sri Lankan court verdict, External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin in New Delhi said, “India’s High Commission in Colombo will appeal to higher court through a lawyer against the judgement by the lower court against these five Indian fishermen”.
He also said that India has been pursuing the case at both levels – legal and official – and will continue doing so.
The issue of fishermen is a very emotive matter for both Sri Lanka and India, where Tamil Nadu-based parties including AIADMK and DMK have been regularly pressing the Centre to take up the matter with the Lankan authorities seriously and have often resented high-profile visits from the island nation.

Kalanilayam’s latest play ‘Anubhava Aaradhanai’ (dramatised and directed by K.S.N.Sundar), is not so much a play, as a quest for the spiritual inspiration behind Tyagaraja’s kritis. ‘Anubhava Aaradhanai,’ is not a whimsical or fanciful interpretation of his kritis, or an attempt to retrofit his life story for the audience, with over dramatised embellishments. For the play is based on a book by Swaminatha Athreya, a scholar known for his meticulous research.
It explores some incidents that inspired the saint’s compositions, and thus gives a context to these kritis. For example, the bhakti of Natesa Achari’s night-long play on Rama moves Tyagaraja to come up with ‘Etavuna’ (Yadukulakambhoji). The kriti mirrors Natesa Achari’s lines in the play.
Ramaraya’s criticisms of Rama are seen as part of the liberties only a true bhakta can take with God, and an emotional Tyagaraja composes ‘Adigi Sukhamu,’ (Madhyamavati) again reflecting word for word the angry outburst of Ramaraya.
The play was more episodic than linear, which was understandable, considering the nature of the production. Although each incident was like a short story with a kriti to mark its conclusion, the sudden shifts, without a proper introduction leading to each of them, resulted in a staccato effect that sometimes left viewers all at sea.
For example, the sudden appearance of a sage in saffron left one befuddled, as it was not immediately clear that it was Upanishad Brahmendral.
Each episode could have begun with a preamble through a voice over, to lend clarity to the proceedings. The play moved at a sedate pace, which could be tedious if one is used to fast- paced drama. Obviously, the nature of ‘Anubhava Aaradhanai’ precluded any histrionics, the focus being the lyrics and their inspiration. It is to the credit of the actors that they effectively highlighted the emotional aspects behind the compositions. Sikkil Gurucharan sang snatches of some kritis and his rendering was moving, capturing fully the bhakti bhava.

Woman harassed over 100 times in 10 hours on New York streets gets rape threatsNew York woman who was harassed 100 times in 10 hours gets rape threats

A video that shows a woman being harassed by men on the streets of New York over 100 times within 10 hours has gone viral. The actor, Shoshana Roberts, has now spoken out on her entire experience that has been created to heighten awareness of street harassment.
Roberts and her friend secretly recorded her walking through the streets of New York City in jeans and a T-shirt as man after man greets her with remarks such as "hey, baby" or "hey, beautiful”. When she does not respond, she is admonished for being rude with comments such as "smile" or "somebody's acknowledging you for being beautiful. You should say thank you more."
The actress describes the motive as, “The frequency is something alarming, and people might know that this was happening but not to the degree that it actually is."

The two-minute video called '10 Hours of Walking in NYC as a Woman' has been viewed over 13 million times since being uploaded to YouTube on Tuesday. As views of the video skyrocketed, Roberts said she had received violent threats online. "The majority of the reactions by email were positive but unfortunately a few ones were negative, involving hurting me, killing me. I'm going to go to the police because I don't feel safe," the actress added.
The video has been produced for charity Hollaback!, which works to end street harassment endured by women and minority groups. The charity said Roberts was also threatened with rape in some comments to the YouTube post. Hollaback! executive director said, "We want this video to show people who are harassed that they are not alone, that we have their back. And for the people doing the harassing, want them to see the impact that this has on us."
Roberts said pestering is a daily reality, which may not always be verbal.

Black money: 10 developments you must know since Modi govt took chargeComments
The Centre has submitted a list of 627 Indians who have accounts in HSBC bank, Geneva, to the Supreme Court on Wednesday, directing a special investigation team (SIT) to complete the tax probe on suspected black money by March next year.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi says he wants to prosecute tax dodgers and bring money stashed in tax havens back into the country but his opponents claim enough progress has not been made since his landslide election victory earlier this year.
Here's the ten developments since the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government took charge at the Centre in May this year:
1. May 27: Modi govt forms SIT
Signalling his government’s resolve to bring back the country’s black money stashed abroad, PM Modi’s first decision in the maiden meeting of his cabinet was to form a high-profile SIT to unearth illicit money.
The SIT is headed by former SC judge MB Shah and includes the highest-level officials from financial and economic departments as well as law enforcement agencies.
The decision came just a day before the apex court’s deadline to form the SIT was set to expire.
2. Oct 17: 'Black money info cannot be disclosed to all'
The Centre on October 17 told the SC that it could not disclose the names of those who have deposited money in banks abroad as it this would jeopardise tax agreements with nations providing those names to India.
This echoes the line taken by the previous United Progressive Alliance government, which the BJP had slammed over alleged inaction on the issue and made it into an election issue earlier this year.
Appearing before a bench headed by Chief Justice HL Dattu, Attorney general Mukul Rohatgi said that all amounts deposited in foreign banks by Indian citizens cannot be termed black money and that it is not a crime to open such accounts.
However, finance minister Arun Jaitley rejected any notion that the BJP was reluctant to make the names public.
3. Oct 17: FM says Switzerland agrees to provide details of black money
Jaitley said that Switzerland had agreed to share information on Indians’ bank accounts on independent evidence provided in each case, marking a major step in efforts to secure data from the Alpine nation, known for its banking secrecy laws.
Jaitley said Switzerland had agreed to share information related to HSBC and Liechestein lists of account holders, provided there is independent evidence collected by Indian authorities.
As per Swiss National Bank's latest data, the total money held by Indians in Swiss banks stood at over Rs. 14,000 crore as on December 2013, up by nearly 42% from a year ago.
4. Oct 27: Govt discloses eight names to SC
Days after it was criticised for backtracking on its election promise to bring back black money stashed abroad, the Modi government named seven persons and a company facing prosecution for keeping illegal wealth in foreign banks.
The much-awaited list did not include names of any politician. Those named in a government affidavit were Pradip Burman of the Dabur group, Rajkot-based bullion trader Pankaj Chimanlal Lodhya and directors of Goa-based mining company Timblo Private Limited — Radha Satish Timblo, Chetan S Timblo, Rohan S Timblo, Anna C Timblo and Mallika R Timblo. Timblo Private Limited, a firm identified by Association for Democratic Reforms as a donor to both the BJP and the Congress, was also named.
5. Oct 27: Oppn slams BJP for calling affidavit historic
Political reactions were sharp after the government revealed the names of seven persons and a company facing prosecution for keeping illegal wealth in foreign banks.
Sambit Patra, a BJP spokesperson, called disclosure of the names "a historic day in the black money case".
But Congress general secretary Digvijaya Singh accused the BJP of "selective revelation" of names and said the process smacked of "blackmail, not black money".
AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal said the revelations of black money account holders should not be selective. "There should not be selective revelation of names. The big fish are being let off," he told the media.
Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi cited four tweets by Modi before the Lok Sabha elections in which he had slammed the previous Manmohan Singh government for its “lack of commitment” to bring back black money from foreign banks.
6. Oct 28: SC pulls up Centre
The apex court directed the government to submit to it the names of all foreign bank account holders by Oct 29, saying it need not provide a “protective umbrella” to such persons.
The court also turned down the government’s request that it modify its order seeking the names of all such account holders. The Centre had contended that the names should be revealed only after investigations proved the accounts indeed held black money and led to prosecution against tax evaders.
7. Oct 29: Centre gives black money full list to SC
The government submitted a list of 627 Indians holding accounts in HSBC Bank, Geneva, to the court, which directed its SIT to examine them and take appropriate action.
After handing over a sealed envelope, attorney general Mukul Rohatgi said it contained three documents — the government’s correspondence with the French government, the list of names and a status report.
8. Oct 29: No revelation, for now
A special bench of the apex court headed Dattu refused to open the envelope handing over by the Centre, saying it would be done by the SIT chairman and vice-chairman.
“We don’t want to open these papers and embarrass anyone. That has never been our intention,” it said.
Scheduling the next hearing for December 3, it asked the SIT to submit a status report by November 30 after ascertaining who had black money accounts abroad.
9. Oct 29: State of confusion
On Tuesday, the top court directed the government to submit the full list after the latter said it wasn’t possible to make the names of all foreign bank account holders public. Rejecting the Centre’s submission, the CJI said, “If it breaches confidentiality, let it be so.”
But on Wednesday, the court refused to open the sealed envelope which contained the list of foreign account holders.
It was also not clear why the court insisted on getting the list from the government when the latter had submitted it to the court-appointed SIT in June.
The Centre, meanwhile, was allowed by the court to raise its objections against making all the names public before the SIT.
10. Oct 30: What's next
The SC-appointed SIT, looking into the black money cases, on Thursday said it will go after the offenders "big or small" but made it clear that confidentiality about account holders abroad will not be violated.
It also said it was gathering more names other than the over 600 account holders in HSBC bank, Geneva, given by the government to the apex court on Wednesday, for investigation.
"Before us, nobody is big, nobody is small. Everybody is equal. Whoever has looted this country will be caught and will be punished, economically and otherwise also. That we assure. Both of us (SIT chief Justice Shah) are too well known for doing it to discomfort of many people," vice chairman Justice Arijit Pasayat said.
The SIT was asked to complete the probe by next March.
What is black money
Black money arises mainly from incomes not disclosed to the government usually to avoid taxation, and, sometimes, because of its criminal links
Size of India's black economy
In 2011, the government had commissioned a joint study by three think-tanks - NIPFP, NIFM and NCAER - to estimate Indian entities' unaccounted wealth both at home and abroad. The final report has not been submitted.
India ranked fifth largest exporter of illicit money between 2002-2011, with a total of $343.04 billion, and in 2011 it was placed third when $84.93 billion was sent abroad, according to a 2013 report titled 'Illicit Financial Flows from Developing Countries: 2002-2011'
According to Global Financial Integrity (GFI), a Washington-based think-tank, Indians salted away $462 billion (about Rs. 28 lakh crore in current exchange rates) in overseas tax havens between 1948-2008.

Black money: SIT says whoever looted India will be caught and punishedComments
The Supreme Court-appointed SIT, looking into the black money cases, on Thursday said it will go after the offenders 'big or small' but made it clear that confidentiality about account holders abroad will not be violated.
It also said it was gathering more names other than the over 600 account holders in HSBC bank, Geneva, given by the government to Supreme Court on Wednesday, for investigation.
"Before us, nobody is big, nobody is small. Everybody is equal. Whoever has looted this country will be caught and will be punished, economically and otherwise also. That we assure. Both of us (SIT chief Justice Shah) are too well known for doing it to discomfort of many people," vice chairman justice Arijit Pasayat said.
Justice Shah said up till now they have decided a number of cases against the big personalities of the country. "We won't bother who is big. We will treat them equally with a poorest person of the country," he told television channels.
Both are retired judges of Supreme Court.
Amidst a raging debate over disclosure of names of foreign bank accounts holders that could threaten future cooperation with other countries, the SIT chairman said confidentiality agreement cannot be violated.
"Confidentiality is an international agreement. You cannot violate the agreement. If you violate it, further information would not be given by them and confirmation by other country is necessary. There is a proof that man is having that account. That proof you won't get it," he said.
Justice Shah said the investigation against people accused of stashing money abroad is going on at "very fast" pace and necessary action will be taken against them.
"It's difficult for me to say when we are going to get money back. But at least investigation is going on very fast and it would give some results," he said.
Justice Shah said the the pace of investigation is not slow. The department is required to follow procedures like issuing notices, hearing the person and thereafter the order can be passed.
"Even if the order is passed, party approaches the court and obtain a stay order. So in that set of circumstances, it is difficult to say that department is not moving fast. The department is moving fast. They (department and officials) have taken action also," he said.
Justice Shah said there will be more prosecution of people who have stashed blackmoney "within the reasonable time". The SIT is also sharing data with other agencies to help it in speeding up its probe, he said.
Attorney general Mukul Rohatgi had on Wednesday submitted a list of 627 names having accounts in HSBC bank, Geneva. These names were earlier shared with the SIT also.
"At present we have 627 (names). Further apart from 627, there are other names which we are gathering also. (we) trying to gather it and it would be investigated and report would be exhaustive," the SIT chief said adding that the panel will go beyond these names.
Justice Pasayat said the SIT will seek "specific data" from people on blackmoney. "We are putting out an advertisement inviting people to give us specific data not any speculation," he said.
Justice Shah said the companies named in reports on illegal mining in few states will also be investigated.
"They (companies) are involved as such. They are (being) investigated and investigation would give result also within few months rather," said the SIT chief, who also probed illegal mining in Odisha, Jharkhand and Goa.
He said the SIT will meet the November-end deadline given by the Supreme Court of filing status report on 627 names shared by the government.

Maharashtra: No Sena leader likely to be sworn in tomorrow  says BJPComments
Devendra Fadnavis, 44, will take oath as the 27th chief minister of Maharashtra and the first Bharatiya Janata Party’s CM in the state at a grand function at Wankhede Stadium on Friday.

The function could be boycotted by the BJP’s estranged ally Shiv Sena which is unhappy over not getting a desired deal to participate in the BJP-led government.
Uncertainty loomed in the Sena camp through Thursday as senior leaders indicated that Thackeray and Sena legislators were unlikely to attend the ceremony.
The party was hoping a solution would emerge after a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP president Amit Shah and Fadnavis in Delhi on Thursday but no such indication was given by the BJP.
Fadnavis is likely to take oath of office in presence of PM Modi, chief ministers of several BJP ruled states, party chief Shah and a large number of celebrities.
Senior BJP leader Rajiv Pratap Rudy said a small team will take oath with Fadnavis and the expansion of the council of ministers would be conducted later. 
“It is unlikely that other party ministers will be sworn in tomorrow. But there is a possibility that it will be our partner in the future,” Rudy said on Thursday, making it  clear that no Sena legislator would be taking oath on Friday.
Reacting to Rudy’s statement, Sena leaders said they would not attend the ceremony. “Our MLAs have expressed that they should be treated with respect if the BJP wants them to be part of the government. If that is not happening then no one from the Sena will attend the ceremony, not even Uddhavji,” said Sena MP Vinayak Raut.
"As our MLAs feel that BJP did not give us due respect, why should we attend the oath-taking ceremony?" Sena MP Vinayak Raut told reporters after meeting party president Uddhav Thackeray.
Sources said the Sena leadership may prefer to wait for few more days as BJP would have to take a decision before the assembly session is held in November to prove majority of the new government.
Meanwhile, the BJP is also grappling with the problem of finalising names of ministers and also the allocation of portfolios. Sources said the issue was discussed in the meeting between Modi, Shah and Fadnavis.

Kerala HC upholds liquor ban  700 bars to be shutKerala HC upholds liquor ban, 700 bars to be shut
HT correspondent , Hindustan Times  Thiruvananthapuram, October 30, 2014
First Published: 15:11 IST(30/10/2014) | Last Updated: 22:13 IST(30/10/2014)
Comments
The Kerala High Court on Thursday upheld the state government’s decision to close down about 700 bars in a boost for the administration which aims to make the state alcohol-free by 2023.
The court, however, allowed heritage and four-star hotels to serve liquor apart from five-star ones that were already exempted.
Kerala has India’s highest per capita alcohol consumption at more than eight litres per person annually while the national average is 5.7 litres.
Bar owners and hoteliers who had challenged the government order in the high court said they will now approach the Supreme Court.
The Congress party-led UDF government has closed more than 400 bars since March by not renewing their operating licences.
“It’s a welcome move. Our aim is total prohibition in a phased manner,” said chief minister Oommen Chandy on the high court order.
The government’s decision came this year after many members of the political class complained about increased underage drinking, a binge-drinking culture and drinking by women in the state.
Thursday’s verdict means the liquor bars in 33 four-star hotels, 21 five-star hotels and eight heritage properties can function.
Total prohibition would cause a monetary loss of about Rs. 9,000 crore a year to the state as sale of alcohol is a key source of revenue for Kerala apart from Gulf remittances.
The government would also have to rehabilitate nearly 25,000 workers at bar hotels who would lose their jobs.
Bar owners say with the alcohol ban Kerala would lose much of its charm as a tourism spot and people would opt for nearby destinations like Goa or Sri Lanka.

Street gets first look at 3rd-quarter GDPStreet gets first look at 3rd-quarter GDP

Now that the Federal Reserve has officially confirmed that it is ending its bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing, or QE, Wall Street can get back to focusing on how fast the economy is growing and how much money U.S. companies are making.
The next wave of market-moving information comes today, when the government reports its first read on third-quarter gross domestic product, or GDP.
Last quarter, the U.S. economy rebounded from a dreary first quarter and grew at a peppy 4.6% rate.
While Wall Street isn’t expecting a repeat of that kind of turbo-charged growth in the third quarter, experts are expecting a very respectable 3% to 3.1% gain, which is viewed as solid growth compared with the lean days following the Great Recession.
(BREAKING NEWS: Third-quarter GDP beats to the upside with economy expanding at rate of 3.5%)
Investors are also expecting the current trend of fewer people lining up for first-time jobless benefits to continue. Economists estimate that 281,000 Americans will file for first-time jobless claims, down from 283,000 the prior week, UBS says.
(BREAKING NEWS: Initial jobless claims came in at 287,000, a tad below expectations but still well below the key 300,000 level.)
The earnings parade also continues. So far, 75% of the companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index have topped third-quarter estimates, above the long-term “beat” average of 63%. Key reports to watch today include cereal maker Kellogg, credit card processor MasterCard, online travel site Expedia and coffee retailer Starbucks.
Investors will be watching to see if earnings and the economy are strong enough to overcome the reduction in Fed stimulus.
In pre-market trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 41 points, or 0.2%, to 16,883.

How to Live and Die on the New Dharavi Diet
Why are so many children whose families who do not live in abject poverty, who have access to food being diagnosed with severe malnutrition in Dharavi?

Two-year-old Ritu’s* first real solid food, according to her mother Prachi, was a plateful of Maggi noodles. Soon after, she graduated to eating roadside ‘Chinese bhel’ and biscuits. For about a year now, Ritu’s been snacking on packaged potato wafers, Kurkure, and other junk food. Her latest obsession is deep-fried bhajiya pav, which she eats almost daily, going by herself to the local vendor in a Dharavi bylane."She is pampered silly by everyone in the house. She refuses to eat any home-cooked food," Prachi says with an indulgent smile.“I tried giving her khimti (dal-rice porridge) when she was about one-and-a-half years old. She wouldn't touch it.” To varying degrees, this might sound like a familiar situation, but here are two surprising details.
One. In May 2014, Ritu was detected not with the conditions that you may associate with highly indulged, junk-food eating children – obesity. Instead, she was detected with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) , a life-threatening condition marked by a very low weight-to-height ratio and visible, severe wasting of muscle and fat.
Ritu’s family lives in Dharavi. But – and here is the second surprising detail – the family doesn’t live in abject poverty, nor is access to food a problem, but she is one of approximately 3,000 children who suffer from malnutrition in Dharavi. In urban slums such as Dharavi, however, barely 5 percent of its malnutrition cases can be attributed to abject poverty and lack of food. The newest cause of malnutrition among children in urban slums like Dharavi is the widespread consumption of junk food.

In 2013, nearly 25 percent of the approximately 44,000 children between 0 and 6 years of age in Mumbai were found to be suffering from Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM), (according to figures supplied by the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), the central government’s initiative to tackle malnutrition in children below 6 years of age and their mothers). In Dharavi, the figure stands at 12 percent. But experts in the area paint a darker picture; they say the figure is actually around 50 percent.
While Dharavi in the popular Indian imagination is a metaphor for abject poverty, today this 557acre Mumbai neighborhood is a center of profitable small-scale industries – including textiles, leather-making, manufacturing of food products and pottery – that are said to be worth $650 million; around Rs 3,981 crore. Dharavi is crucial to the Mumbai economy. A vast part of Dharavi is – no question about it – a slum. The squalid living conditions, the common toilets and tiny, muggy rooms barely touched by sunlight have not changed. But today the people who live here have to pay rents ranging from Rs 4,000 to Rs 6,000 per month, even for houses as tiny as 250sq meters. Most houses have a television set, a mixie, a scooter. Sometimes even a gas connection. So under these conditions children are not malnourished because they are not eating enough food. They are malnourished because they are eating only food with no nutrients in them.
Parents spend up to Rs 25-30 per day on packaged food or other kinds of junk food for their children, say ICDS officials in Dharavi. “About 45 percent of infants in Dharavi probably consume sweet snacks and 25 percent consume salty snacks and this increases with age,” says Neena Shah More, Director of the Aahar project of the SNEHA, an NGO that aims to improve the health and nutrition of children under three in Dharavi.
The promise in the packet
Around 12.30pm on a school day, the local nursery school at Matunga Labor Camp has just ended. Soon around 40 children throng the store opposite the school. Most buy wafers, biscuits and chocolates, all of which cost less than Rs 5 each. Sadiq Hussain, who runs a store in one of the bylanes near Dharavi’s 90 Feet Road, says, “When I started 25 years ago, the children would buy things for 25 paise. Now, they have Rs 10 in their hands.”
Sadiq Hussain, a store-owner in a Dharavi bylane, has seen spending on junk food increase over the years. Photo …
Hussain claims that a decade ago, the distributors of major companies also started showing up in Dharavi. It was also a decade ago that CK Prahalad’s seminal book The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid was published. Prahalad argued that the basic economics of the bottom-of-the-pyramid market is based on “small unit packages, low margin per unit, high volume, and high return on the capital employed.”
After Indian companies successfully started selling shampoos in Re 1 sachets in the 1990s, the principle of selling products in small unit packages proliferated across other categories of products, including food. Many companies, including Parle Products , PepsiCo , Nestle and others have diversified their products with this market in mind. They have products priced between Re 1 and Rs 5. They advertise with posters, danglers, house-to-house campaigns and give sops to retailers. In cities where television has proliferated in all sections of society, residents of urban slums too aspire to consume packaged foods and to consume brands.
Not surprisingly today, though there are many small-scale food industries in Dharavi, packaged foods sells far more. “The locally made chivda and laddoos hardly sell. We only stock biscuits and wafers worth Rs 5,” says Parthiv Fan, a wholesaler in Dharavi. Children routinely ask for new products based on the new ads they see, says Manoj Mogawe, a shopkeeper at Matunga Labor Camp, while handing chocolate over to a three-year-old boy. He sells about 25 packets of wafers priced at Rs 5 every day. “Children as young as one crawl to the shops,” says SNEHA’s Shah More.
In the particular conditions of Dharavi, parents often see the packaged foods as clean, unadulterated, healthy options. Harried parents are lured by the promise of nutrition in advertisements. “Glucose biscuits” are seen as providing “taakat” to the children. Juice packets with pictures of apples are seen as nutritious. “The mothers feel that if [companies are] making food in a factory and packing it so well, it must be good,” says Shah More.
It must be good, thinks the Dharavi customer. And like the customer anywhere else, she thinks, it must be cool. Damodar Mall, CEO, Value Retail at Reliance Retail and author of Supermarketwala: Secrets to Winning Consumer India, says that the aspirations of people across classes are now distinctly democratized. “Modern products stand for small joys of life. In urban areas, all classes consume the same television media and absorb the same aspirations. Incomes have also grown. The companies are selling products tuning into the earnings and cash flow cycle of these people who earn by the day and aspire by the day.”
As Mall says, there’s more facilitating the consumption of junk food in Dharavi than its mere presence – there’s the sense of having moved up in life associated with it.
Sanjana is a Dharavi resident in her twenties. “I remember my father who had migrated to Mumbai for work would send biscuits and chocolates to Mahad [175km from Mumbai] where we were growing up. We couldn't get all these foods in Mahad,” she said. They grew up eating dal, rice and vegetables.
Sanjana’s two-year-old (and severely malnourished) daughter Priyanka is growing up in a different world from her. Not only are those treats readily available, the food her mother grew up on is distinctly uncool. And not just among little children. The mother of a three-year-old buying a sweet and rice crispies at a small Dharavi store tells me she sometimes buys the child a packaged snack for school lunch. “The teachers say that they don’t want the children to eat sticky food.”
What’s cooking in Dharavi
Under most conditions working mothers do not have it easy raising children, but in a slum like Dharavi, it is exceptionally tough. Many working mothers in Dharavi find it difficult to adequately breastfeed their children or cook for them. In addition to their jobs as cleaning or cooking maids, workers at small scale industries, or selling knick-knacks, the women must store water, cook meals, feed the children, buy provisions from the ration shops, send their children to school, and pick them up and take them to the doctor when they fall sick. The pressure to feed children and to actually create the food the children eat has always been on the women of Dharavi. Fathers are rarely involved. Many of these women do not have the time to sit down with their youngest children and feed them by hand. They expect their children to eat on their own, even if they are a year old.
Grassroots-level social workers say that many women in Dharavi – leaving home at 8am as they do – can only cook once a day, for dinner. Packaged food then becomes the obvious solution. Most mornings, children here eat khari (a biscuit made of refined flour and vanaspati or refined vegetable oil loaded with trans fats) and tea, or biscuits and tea. Little children in Dharavi are adept – like children everywhere else – at seeking Rs 5 or Rs 10 from their parents to buy snacks from nearby stores. Unlike children elsewhere though, these biscuits may be the only thing they eat all day.
Sanjana’s daughter Priyanka, who is two, weighs barely 7.5 kg. Priyanka has been suffering from SAM for the last three months and catches infections at least twice or thrice a month. Their home is clean, with an old television, a washing machine and a gas stove laid neatly in different corners of her family’s living room. Sanjana, who introduced her to biscuits when she was barely a year old, says Priyanka snacks on junk food all day. The house has two large containers full of snacks set aside for Priyanka, who finishes them all off in two weeks. While her parents try to feed her two small bowls – just about 150g each – of rice, dal and vegetables (which she sometimes takes two whole hours to finish), this quantity is much less than what an average two-year-old should consume.
Why no one can stop with just one
Two-year-old Divya can barely talk but she easily negotiates the narrow alleys outside her house to the nearby corner shop to ask for her favorite item. “I have to make her a pack of Maggi noodles at least once a day. She has a hole in her heart and needs surgery. The doctor has told us to ensure she puts on weight. But she barely eats two small bowls of rice a day,” says Nanda, her mother.
Over time, the term junk food has ceased to register the contempt the nomenclature originally contained. We talk of our love for junk food with affection, mild embarrassment or feigned horror at our lack of control when confronted with a packet of chips.
In his 2013 book Salt Sugar Fat , Pulitzer award-winner Michael Moss writes extensively of the research big processed food companies put into creating products that are heavy on fat, sugar and salt – products that make the pleasure centers in our brain addicted. As he says in an interview, “And while we always knew that eating too much of what I like to call “the foods we hate to love” would make us overweight or otherwise ill, we now know from these documents and interviews that the food companies have known this for years and years – even as they continued adding heaps of salt, sugar and fat to their products.”
While we are all vulnerable to the salt-sugar-fat addictions, the empty calories of this addiction affects some populations more than others. The National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad is currently researching urban child nutrition across 16 states in India. “The consumption level of children, both from educated and uneducated families, is just 75 percent of the recommended dietary allowance in almost all kinds of nutrients. Of this one-fifth [is junk food]. We also noticed that in school tiffins, the parents regularly put in a packet of wafers, or biscuits,” says N Lakshmaiah, the scientist heading the research.
Can packaged food like glucose biscuits take the place of a home-cooked meal? “As per our investigations, the glucose in these biscuits is nominal. These corporates palm off the product as healthy, but it usually has only maida and sugar. Noodles anywhere in the world cannot be made without maida. The sugar and salt content in these products is addictive and unhealthy,” says Pritee Shah, chief general manager of the Ahmedabad-based Consumer Education and Research Center (CERC).
Adults may recover from actual starvation or even the hidden malnutrition of junk food. Malnutrition in young children has serious long-term effects including diminished motor, sensory, cognitive, social and emotional development. Studies show that malnourished children are less likely to perform well in school and more likely to grow into malnourished adults, at greater risk of disease and early death. Many children here in Dharavi catch infections – particularly frequent or persistent diarrhea, pneumonia and sometimes tuberculosis. The infections are a result of underlying immunity, and in turn make them susceptible to acute malnutrition.

Parle Products and PepsiCo refused to comment for this story. A spokesperson for Nestle India, which manufactures Maggi instant noodles, a popular food item among Dharavi residents, says, “Maggi has a portfolio that caters to families across the income pyramid and is not specific to any group.” He adds that their consumer research and other published data shows that a large number of Indian consumers are unable to afford meals that provide the relevant nutrients.
Changing the recipe
Alka Jadhav is the professor of Pediatrics at Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital, Sion. She says, “For a one-year-old, there have to be five complementary feeds such as rice porridge, dal, fruits and vegetables, apart from breast milk. Junk food compromises their nutritional intake, both in quality and the quantity.” Since this is unlikely for most Dharavi households, the hospital’s Nutrition Rehabilitation Center (NRC) has stepped in to the breach. The Nutrition Rehabilitation Center (NRC) treats most of the malnourished infants from Dharavi. Divya, the two-year-old with a hole in her heart, was diagnosed with SAM a few months ago. She has since been regularly fed a ready-to-use potent mixture of peanut butter, soya and milk powder, and essential micronutrients provided by NRC and distributed by SNEHA staffers. Divya is no longer severely malnourished, but she is still moderately malnourished.
But nutritional supplements are not enough. Sarita, who works as domestic help, lives with her four children (the oldest 6 years old, the youngest 21 months) in a shanty next to a garbage bin. The house is made of bamboo and a tarpaulin sheet with one side open to the sky. All her four children rarely sit inside as there is no space for them.
Mohan, Sarita’s youngest, sleeps in the corner of the house in a cloth cradle. He was never breastfed exclusively as Sarita’s income feeds the entire family. Since he was two months old, Mohan was fed biscuits soaked in milk as a makeshift porridge. Mohan weighs a little over 7kg and was diagnosed with MAM about six months ago. He recently learned how to sit up, but is still not able to walk. Sarita hasn’t given up. She says, “My heart says he will walk. But he falls sick all the time. He suffers from constant attacks of diarrhea, skin rashes and seizures. Sometimes he eats a morsel of dal-rice, but vomits. He is not putting on any weight. I don't know what to do.”
The idea of just saying no to junk food or even just nutritional supplements is not a solution for this family. While Sarita is away at work, her sister -in-law takes care of her children. She has four children of her own, one of whom is an infant. “When I used to take leave from work early, my employers did not like it,” Sarita says.
The government provides for crèches under the Rajiv Gandhi National Crèche Scheme for Children of Working Mothers. There are 54 such crèches in Mumbai that cater to about a miniscule 800 children in the city. Three of them are in Dharavi. I visited one crèche run by the Community Outreach Program (CORP) situated inside a big hall provided by the Kannada Methodist Church in the middle of the slum at Mukund Nagar, Dharavi. The crèche had around 100 children under the age of 5. Some are a few months old. Nirmal Chandappa, the director of CORP, says, “There is an acute shortage of these crèches in the area. We get as many as 200 applications in all our three centers, when we can admit only 30 to 40 children a year,” said.
Worse, the amount sanctioned for nutrition of the children under the scheme is a measly Rs 2.10 per day, while the caretakers are given Rs 1,000 per month as honorarium. CORP says it gets only 30 percent of the funds for running the crèche from the government – the rest comes from donations. And there are strong indications that the number of crèches are likely to shrink. “With the lack of space and so little money allotted, it is just not feasible for NGOs to apply for a crèche in Mumbai. Over the past 5-6 years, we have not allotted a single crèche in Mumbai,” said an officer from the Maharashtra Social Welfare Board that runs the scheme, on condition of anonymity.
Dharavi has 300 anganwadis under the ICDS program that reach out to nearly 25,000 children. On paper, the scheme is supposed to improve the health of preschool children, pregnant women and nursing mothers by providing supplementary nutrition and education on immunization, nutrition and health education. “The ICDS works well at the level of spot feeding. We provide supplementary nutrition to children in the slums. But, the nutrition counselling is on the [backburner] because of the excessive workload on the anganwadi workers. We are providing for [an additional] worker per anganwadi which may fill the deficit,” said Ujwal Uke, principal secretary of Maharshtra’s Department of Women and Child Development.
The weighing of the children is regularly fudged and completely haphazard, experts say (if the children are not weighed properly, or regularly, it is very difficult to determine their malnutrition status). Vandana Krishna, director-general of Rajamata Jijau Mother-Child Health and Nutrition Mission, said that most of the ICDS statistics are completely unreliable. The program, according to experts, lacks a number of things: supervision, clear roles for the anganwadi workers, training, and regular appraisal of the workers, which ensures accountability. Since the Maharashtra state elections have been announced, all the ICDS workers have been working for the Election Commission on various tasks.
How can the problem of malnutrition in children be tackled? “In a situation like Dharavi or any other urban slum, a community kitchen run by trusted, well-established organizations that can cook wholesome food for children for a nominal amount may work. Something on the lines of ‘Amma Canteens’,” says Krishna. Amma Canteens is a government food subsidy program in Tamil Nadu which runs canteens that serve cheap, healthy foods.
SNEHA has a complex, community-based approach to dealing with the problem. In collaboration with the ICDS, local municipality and the Nutrition Research and Rehabilitation Center, they have piloted the first Community-based Management of Acute Malnutrition program. The community organizers measure the nutritional status of all children below age of three, make regular visits to homes of children suffering from SAM and MAM and refer them for check-ups. Their efforts are paying off. “In about 18 months of running the project in 2000 families, malnutrition in 0-3 years children has fallen by 18 percent. However, it is a challenge to sustain this with the constant movement and migration of young children,” says Shah More.
While the context of Dharavi’s hidden malnutrition remains difficult, there is no understating SNEHA’s work has had on individual families.
After Ritu was detected with SAM about a year ago, SNEHA’s community organizer built up a rapport with her mother Prachi and explained that her condition was precarious. It was difficult to feed the child home cooked dal-rice and vegetables when she was completely accustomed to eating junk food. The child was severely malnourished for for nine months. When she gained a little weight, she started walking only a few months ago.
Ritu is now 10kg and her weight gain is normal for her age. “I understand that home-cooked food is good and outside food is not good. I try feeding her a few home-cooked meals now. My child looks healthier now,” said Prachi, smiling.

Sensex @ fresh life high of 27 390; 5 reasons why mkts are on a rollBirla Sun
(The S&P BSE Sensex hit…)
NEW DELHI: Both S&P BSE Sensex and Nifty made fresh highs today, surging nearly 2 per cent each in trade on Friday. The 30-share index ended the day at 27,865.83, up 519.50 points, or 1.90 per cent. The Nifty shut shop at 8322.20, up 153 points, or 1.87 per cent.
The Sensex hit its fresh lifetime high of 27,894.32 in intraday trade, while the 50-share Nifty index rose over 150 points to make its all-time high of 8,330.75.
The previous all-time high for Sensex was 27,354.99.
Here are seven reasons why markets made fresh highs:
1. US Fed ends QE but maintains status quo on interest rates:
The US Federal Reserve has ended its quantitative easing program, which it began five years ago, to keep economy afloat in the wake of a huge financial crisis.
While the market was anticipating winding up of quantitative easing by the US Fed, there were concerns regarding the US interest rates.
However, the US Fed assuaged investor concerns by maintaining its stand of keeping benchmark short-term rate near zero 'for a considerable time'. This is giving comfort to investors as inflows are expected to continue with ease till at least mid next year.
"As far as its impact on emerging markets - particularly India - is concerned, India has made an adjustment since last year. When QE is reversed, there will be some capital outflow, some adjustment, but that will be nothing compared to the taper tantrums we had last year. There will be a quick adjustment through a fairly stable equilibrium," said Former RBI Governor D Subbarao to ET Now.
2. Liquidity flow to continue in India: The US has ended its quantitative easing program, but inflows in Indian markets are likely to continue as other countries such as Japan and Europe are extending their easing monetary policy.
The earnings cycle is expected to improve in the next few quarters, there are hopes of lower interest rates and pick-up in growth in Indian economy in the next couple of years.
"While the US does say that it is going to withdraw QE, I would expect that both Japan and Europe will continue with monetary and quantitative easing for a couple of quarters more. The early indications seem to suggest so," said Sashi Krishnan , Chief Investment Officer, Birla Sun Life Insurance.
"Therefore, if you look at the net liquidity that gets added to the global markets, I do not think they are going to get impacted too much," Krishnan added.
3. Government on reforms track: The government is working towards carrying outs its reforms agenda. After diesel de-regulation and forming an ordinance on coal blocks, it has now relaxed norms in the construction sector.
The Cabinet has decided to allow 100 per cent FDI under automatic route and lowered cap on minimum investment to $5 million from $10 million earlier.
According to the government, the measures taken by it are likely to attract investments in new areas and encourage development of plots for serviced housing given the shortage of land in and around urban agglomerations as well as the high cost of land.
These are confidence boosting measures and raise hopes of more reform-oriented policies in the coming months. Analysts are expecting the next budget will be pro-reforms. This is likely to keep foreign investors bullish and lead to more inflows in India.
4. Electoral success in assembly elections: The win for the BJP continues at the ballot. After impressive performance in the Lok Sabha , the party has bettered its performance in the states of Haryana and Maharashtra. The party has got first its first ever chief ministers in Haryana and Maharashtra.
The outcome of assembly elections will improve the party's tally in the upper house of Parliament and help the government in passing important bills in both the houses.
"There are a lot of positive thoughts around the Indian economy right now, largely thanks to the impressive election victory by Mr. Modi's party. If they achieve some of the things that they set to achieve in terms of making the Indian economy less bureaucratic to a certain extent and more efficient, then that could see growth rates rise," said William Hobbs , VP Research, Economics & Strategy at Barclays.
5. Favourable macros: The macros for the Indian economy are improving with easing inflation and lower commodities prices. There are expectations that the RBI may lower interest rates earlier than expected as inflation is coming under the RBI's target zone.
"Over the last several months, since this government has come to office, we have seen macro indicators stabilising - indeed improving. Growth is in an uptrend, inflation is on a downtrend, and there have been significant adjustments on the current account , fiscal consolidation is on track, investment sentiment is reviving, etc," said Subbarao.
"All these improved indicators will deliver cyclical upturn in growth from below 5 per cent last year to 5.5 per cent this fiscal year, and to may be 6 to 6.5 per cent in the next couple of years," he added.

Black money: Even powerful illegal a/c holders will not be spared  says Justice MB Shahaccount holder
("Courts would decide whether…)
ET Now caught up with Retired Justice MB Shah , the chief of Special Investigation Team (SIT) heading the black money probe, for his views on the black money case. Excerpts:
ET Now: The world is watching you and the Supreme Court has given you a very stringent deadline as far as this SIT probe is concerned — status report by November, final report by March 2015. Are you confident of meeting the stringent deadline because there are many angles, many names that you have to go over?
Retired Justice MB Shah: I do not think there will be any difficulty in doing the work. It would be achieved before the deadline.
ET Now: Why is this deadline so crucial? Is it because a lot of cases cannot be opened after March 2015?
Retired Justice MB Shah: Only for expediting the work, expediting the investigation, expediting deciding cases against the persons.
ET Now: At this stage, have you shared any names with the CBI or the Enforcement Directorate? Many of the names will be looked into even by the investigative agencies.
Retired Justice MB Shah: All the names have been shared with all the investigating agencies.
ET Now: So as of now, all the 627 names that have been given to you have been shared with investigative agencies?
Retired Justice MB Shah: Not all 627. Only the names of persons who are involved in an offence have been shared. Others will be investigated by the Income Tax Department.
ET Now: Three names have been made public. Is it because there is a case against them? What is the next course of legal action against these three people?
Retired Justice MB Shah: Legal action will be taken against the persons who are involved in it.
ET Now: What about the others? Are there many cases that are closed to prosecution?
Retired Justice MB Shah: I cannot tell you that at the moment.
ET Now: Will there be uniform penalty on people who are found guilty?
Retired Justice MB Shah: That penalty would be decided by the courts, and not by us. SIT cannot decide anything on what penalty should be levied. Courts would decide whether he/she should be punished or not. What type of fine should be levied, it depends on many factors.
ET Now: Can you assure our viewers that no matter how powerful, how big, how influential the people are, they will not be spared?
Retired Justice MB Shah: We have never spared any individual on the ground that he is powerful, on the ground that he is rich, on the ground that he can influence. Nobody has influenced us up till now. Do not worry about it.
ET Now: So there is no pressure that you are feeling right now?
Retired Justice MB Shah: No pressure, no pressure at any moment, at any point of time.
ET Now: There is an apprehension that some of the people in this list are legitimate accounts holders. They may not be black money holders after all.
Retired Justice MB Shah: Nothing would be done against such persons, because the department itself would take no action.
ET Now: But what about the argument: if they have legitimate accounts, why have them in foreign banks, why not have them in India?
Retired Justice MB Shah: It's because they are residing somewhere else. They are NRIs. They are entitled to have such accounts.
ET Now: And what about the Indians who have legitimate Swiss Bank accounts? Doesn't that raise concern?
Retired Justice MB Shah: No, in case of legitimate Swiss Bank accounts, the department would not take action. That is certain. In any case, courts are there. Do not worry about it.

5 Indian fishermen sentenced to death by Lan...5 Indian fishermen sentenced to death by Sri Lankan court

(The five fishermen, all…)
COLOMBO/NEW DELHI: Five Indian fishermen were given death penalty by a Sri Lankan court today for alleged drug trafficking, prompting a response from India that it will appeal to a higher court against the judgement.
The five fishermen, all hailing from Tamil Nadu, were apprehended in 2011 by the Sri Lankan Navy on charges of smuggling of drugs, official sources said.
The five Indians are among a group of eight people sentenced to death by the high court in Colombo. They had been arrested on a boat in the seas off northern Jaffna's Delft islet.
The High Court judge Preethi Padman Surasena passed judgement on the five Indians and three Sri Lankans for involvement in heroin trafficking between India and Sri Lanka in 2011.
However, the Indian government , which has been pursuing their case for the last four years, maintains that it has done due diligence and found them to be innocent.
Immediately reacting to the Sri Lankan court verdict, External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin in New Delhi said, "India's High Commission in Colombo will appeal to higher court through a lawyer against the judgement by the lower court against these five Indian fishermen".
He also said that India has been pursuing the case at both levels - legal and official - and will continue doing so.
The issue of fishermen is a very emotive matter for both Sri Lanka and India, where Tamil Nadu-based parties including AIADMK and DMK have been regularly pressing the Centre to take up the matter with the Lankan authorities seriously and have often resented high-profile visits from the island nation.

Swiss: Info can t be disclosed outside proce...Department of Finance
(The comments come at a time…)
NEW DELHI/BERNE: Amid a debate on disclosure of names of suspected black money holders, Switzerland today said information exchanged under Swiss-India tax treaty cannot be disclosed "in principle" to a court or any other body outside the proceedings of a 'specific and relevant' case.
The comments come at a time when a Supreme Court-monitored Special Investigation Team is probing alleged stashing of black money by Indians aboard, including Swiss banks.
Switzerland, long accused of being a safe haven for illicit funds, has promised to extend assistance to India and reply to requests for information in a "time-bound" manner on cases of alleged tax evasion and financial crimes, or provide a reason if no information can be shared.
Explaining the treaty provisions about disclosure of such 'secret' information, a Swiss Finance Ministry spokesperson told PTI from Berne that authorities from the two countries are having "regular contacts on bilateral tax matters" but refused to comment on particular cases.
The government yesterday gave to the Supreme Court a list of 627 Indians with accounts in a Swiss branch of HSBC bank, on which probe for suspected black money is underway.
While this list was given in 'sealed envelopes', three other names were made public a day earlier as prosecution had been launched against those persons.
There has been a debate on whether disclosure of names, without prosecution, could violate tax treaties under which these names and other details are shared by foreign countries.
Replying to queries in this regard, the Swiss Federal Department of Finance spokesperson said that the protocol to Swiss-Indian DTA (Double Taxation Agreement) states that any information received "by a contracting state shall be treated as 'secret' in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that state..."
The treaty further provides that any such information "shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of (information), the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes ... or the oversight of the above."
The Swiss Finance Ministry spokesperson further said the treaty states that "such persons or authorities shall use the information 'only' for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions".
"Accordingly, the information exchanged under the terms of the DTA can be provided to a Court in situations where it is dealing with a specific case related to tax matters for which this information is relevant. Conversely, information cannot be disclosed in principle to a Court or another body outside of such proceedings," the official added.
 
The spokesperson, however, declined to comment on "particular cases", citing the confidentiality provisions of the Swiss-Indian DTA.
"We can nevertheless inform you that the relevant authorities of Switzerland and India have regular contacts on bilateral tax matters," the Swiss official added.
The exchange of information on tax matters between India and Switzerland is based on the double taxation agreement (DTA) and the protocol that was signed in 2010 between the two countries. It has been in force since October 2011.
"This agreement is in line with the international standards and provides for exchange of information on request," the spokesperson said.
The list of 627 persons with accounts in a Swiss branch of HSBC bank was received by India from the French government, while it had earlier got another list of Indians with suspected black money accounts from Germany.

NEW DELHI: Under attack over his remarks that official auditor should not "sensationalise" its audit findings, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today said media did not accurately reflect the spirit of his speech at the CAG conference.
"News reports of my speech at the CAG conference do not accurately reflect the spirit of my speech," Jaitley said in a Facebook post.
The Finance Minister has also uploaded the link of the speech he delivered at the valedictory meet of the annual Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) conference here yesterday.
Jaitley in his speech had said the government auditor should not sensationalise its findings to get into headlines.
"Auditor should be conscious of the fact that he is reviewing a decision that has already been taken. Have the fair procedures been followed?
"He doesn't have to sensationalise. He doesn't have to get into the headlines," he had said.
Congress leader Digvijay Singh today took a dig at Jaitley for asking the CAG not to sensationalise its findings to get into headlines.
"CAG should not sensationalise its findings,"- Arun Jaitley. Wish he had realised this when 2G and coal block CAG reports came!", the Congress General Secretary said on Twitter .
Congress party had voiced similar views in the past after huge notional losses were projected in reports on 2G and coal allocation scams.
Another Congress leader Ajay Maken said his party "strongly condemns" Jaitley's statement.
"When CAG report used to be leaked even before it was placed before the Parliament, and when the Finance Minister's party, based on that report, use to disrupt Parliament for days, did he forget that CAG was being sensationalised then also," Maken said.

Med-sized firm in India makes 33 tax-related...Doing Business Report
(As per the latest 'Doing…)
NEW DELHI: It needs 33 payments in a year, over 20 hours of time every month and up to 61.7 per cent of profits for a medium-sized company to comply with tax laws in India, making the country one of the worst places in the world for 'paying taxes'.
As per the latest 'Doing Business Report' published by the World Bank, India is ranked 156th out of 189 nations in terms of paying taxes. It has slipped two positions on this front from the last year.
Paying taxes addresses the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes.
These measures include the number of payments an entrepreneur must make; the number of hours spent preparing, filing, and paying; and the percentage of their profits they must pay in taxes.
According to the report, the total tax rate in India can be as high as 61.7 per cent, there are as many as 33 payments under the head of profit, labour and other taxes, and the time taken to comply with taxation requirements could be as much as 243 hours.
In terms of time taken to comply with tax related work, India ranks better than the South Asian average where it takes 325.3 hours and its emerging market peers such as China (261 hours), according to a World Bank report.
India was placed 156th position in the overall ranking of paying taxes, above Brazil (177th) and below the Russian Federation (49th) and China, which was ranked 120th.
The United Arab Emirates and Qatar were placed in the first place followed by Saudi Arabia in the third position in the overall ranking.
The report noted that some of the tax reforms in India include easing the administrative burden of paying taxes for firms by introducing mandatory electronic filing and payment for value added tax.
In addition, India has also reduced the administrative burden of paying taxes by abolishing the fringe benefit tax and improving electronic payment.
The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed on June 1, 2014, covering the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2013 (January 1, 2013 - December 31, 2013).

Google bought Motorola Mobility in 2012 for $12.4 billion but appeared to decide quickly the purchase was a mistake. It sold its set-top operations to Arris Group Inc. $2.35 billion and its smartphone assets, along with some 2,000 patents, to Lenovo.
Lenovo chairman Yang Yuanqing said when the purchase was announced in January that it would help transform Lenovo into a global competitor in smartphones.

Procedures That Cannot Be Ignored While Buying a Property
CommonFloor.com
In India, investment in real estate is not just about money and profits. People here get attached to their assets and develop an emotional bond with all the properties they own. While an investment in a first home is a must have for anyone, is it really advisable to invest in a second home? Is there a difference between a second home and an investment property? Does it really make sense to own a second home? This article is a humble attempt to answer the above mentioned questions.
Real estate market has witnessed constant growth over the past 50 years
The real estate market in India has grown exponentially in the past 50 years. To be very precise, it has grown at the rate of at least 10-15 per cent every year in the second half of the previous century. Other than the property market, such an exponential growth is possible only in equities and share, which is relatively riskier, considering the drastic fluctuation in the national and international share markets. In such a scenario, an investment in the real estate market in a second home is certainly a profitable move.
Second home provides a tax hedge
The purchase of a second home presents you with a number of tax benefits. Though these tax benefits are less when compared to the investment in your first home, it certainly helps you save some tax money. Seventy percent of the rent that you collect from the tenants of your second home can be adjusted towards the interest that you pay for the home loan for the second home. If the interest paid is more than the rent that you receive, you can set off the “loss from the second home” against your regular income, thus saving tax. Even when you choose to sell a second home for profits, the acquisition cost is calculated and deducted from the sale price, and the tax is calculated only on the balance amount.
Every city has its prime localities where the ultra HNIs throng to buy residential property and flaunt their lifestyle.

The Star Alliance perspectiveMark Davies, Director, Marketing and Loyalty, Star Alliance
What you need to know about frequent flier programmes
To further demystify the frequent flier programme, Cat.a.lyst spoke with Mark Davies, Director, Marketing and Loyalty, Star Alliance, the 27 global airline club. Edited excerpts from an interview:
What does Star Alliance offer flyers in terms of FFPs?
We are not promising you everything that you are used to on your frequent flyer programme when you fly on the alliance. But we are promising a certain set of things such as ‘earn and burn’ when you fly on any member airline in obviously the right class. You can then earn miles on any member carrier flying across the world. You can then redeem these miles on any member airline in the Alliance.
You can redeem miles to purchase a seat or upgrade across every single member airline. This is available to everybody; as long as you join a programme you can ‘earn or burn’. If you do it on one programme then all the miles that you earn get accumulated on one programme, this is more popularly known as a one-card concept.
Why blackout dates?
These are based on capacity. You have a possibility to go on every single flight but if the flight is full, say, I have been trying to buy a ticket between Frankfurt and London on December 24 then there is no way I will get it even though I am willing to pay money for it, because it is full.
Is there any standard for how many miles you travel to get one FFP mile?
No, it is based on your FFP.
So, how do you integrate 27 airlines?
The key point is that there is no Star Alliance Frequent Flyer Programme. There are 19 FFPs. Some of them have five or six carriers in one programme like Miles and More in which there are six carriers, not just Lufthansa, but also Brussels, LOT, Austrian, Swiss Adria.
A flyer can join one or as many FFPs as he or she wants of the 19 programmes. The programme has a relationship with the customer. If you are in the Miles and More programme you collect miles on that programme and not on Star Alliance. Because of the different markets that airlines operate in different conditions offer different options. But you cannot share or shift miles between programmes.
How come you can buy but not burn?
The commercial decision to invent a programme is a decision of the carrier. The airlines account for the liabilities of the programme in their profit and loss. The commercial relationships which they enter are always bilateral relationships no matter if it is another Star Alliance member or a baggage manufacturer. What they do is put a value to each of the flights that you are doing on another airline but they manage that value within their profit and loss. We have no influence on that.

Constantly-moving advantageColgate is today a generic brand? Am I right?
New Delhi
Swapna, right and wrong.
Colgate is surely the generic toothpaste of India. That is, however, a dangerous position to occupy. When a brand becomes a bit too generic, it means everything to everybody, and nothing to anyone. Brands need to insulate themselves from such a situation. In the past, Dalda has seen it happen to its brand in India.
Colgate has, therefore, invested heavily in segmenting its usage and thought patterns well in India. The brand is, forever, innovating its offerings. Yes, while the bulk of its consumption remains with the mother category of Colgate white, its image as a front-runner in the space of oral hygiene, constantly innovating and constantly pushing the envelope of relevance and originality, is important and is part of its core strength.
There have been many other firsts for the new variant brands, but not all have gotten to occupy the space that Colgate occupies at the top of the brand mountain. To that extent, it is not only the “first-mover” advantage, it has been the “constantly-moving” advantage that Colgate has used that makes it number one.
Getting generic is a big challenge the brand has to face. It needs to rise above the morass of being a generic brand of generic intent.
The colas seem to be reviving? What say, Mr Bijoor?
Gurgaon
Rohit, the sparkling coloured flavoured sugared drinks category in India is stuck in the paradigm of heat. The hotter it gets, the more it sells. The category has not been able to break its way into being an all-season drink, as it is in the developed markets of the world. This, I do believe, is problem number one. Problem number two for the category is sugar and the heated debate on it in the West. The link to obesity has brought for it an early glass ceiling in India. These two basic issues have shoved this category into a subliminal social-ostracism orbit.
This year we will see brands battling both these fronts with ideas that are innovative. Brands need to jump out of their besottedness with endorsers and what they can bring to the party, though. The category needs to think basic and break the basic barriers that restrict it in the country.
Let’s see. The industry, for sure, has its fingers crossed on your question and is hanging all its marketing money on it.
There is talk of the government stepping in to control advertising. Should it happen?
New Delhi
Terry, I do believe the Government has been pushed to this point of working on a set of regulations. This has happened due to a whole set of marketers possibly not sticking to the best practices of responsible advertising.
I, however, believe that there is the ASCI as a nodal body that has been doing yeoman work in this space. I would encourage a dialogue between the government and the ASCI on this. In a country with a democratic framework that is as vibrant as ours, self-regulation is certainly better than government regulation. We need to, therefore, focus on revving up the self-regulation part of our business rather than invite government regulation.
Many ads have misled in the past, but most of these come from small, little, marketing companies that are yet to tread the path of responsible advertising. Most lie in the realm of false or fast-track claims. It is important for brands to show responsibility on this score. Responsible brands advertise responsibly. Let’s remember, we are not in the realm of a magic remedy. We are all about products and services that aid consumers live a better and more comfortable life. A life they want to live.

IAF issued advisory 4 months back  says no ban on Xiaomi or other phonesPrint
Says they were more concerned about inferences being drawn from location data
Written by Debashis Sarkar | New Delhi | Posted: October 29, 2014 12:38 am | Updated: October 30, 2014 2:48 pm
The recent privacy scare regarding Xiaomi smartphones was just hype after all as the Indian Air Force (IAF) on Tuesday clarified to IndianExpress.com that the said advisory against using phones from this Chinese brand was about “four to five months old”. That would mean the alert was from before the Xiaomi started selling its phones in India.
The Sunday Standard (part of The New Indian Express Group) had on October 19 reported that IAF had issued an alert with ‘medium’ severity rating against the use of Xiaomi smartphones on account of ‘spying’. IndianExpress.com had reported that the IAF alert might have been based on an old report by software security firm F-Secure , which has since been corrected.
Here is all you need to know:
Xiaomi claims data migration from China not related to IAF alert
“The advisory itself is about four months old. The strange thing is that it has now been pulled out by the media. No new notification has been issued by IAF recently regarding the use of Xiaomi smartphones. The advisory should not be misunderstood as a ban. There are no restrictions in IAF regarding the use of smartphones from any brand as it is totally for personal usage,” said an officer in the Western Command to IndianExpress.com , who did want his name to be quoted.
Citing the reason for the advisory he said: “IAF doesn’t keep track of the smartphone market and neither does it recommend any particular brand or handset to its personnel. The advisory did not mention anything on banning the use of Chinese smartphones at all. It was more like a cautionary note as the handset was tracking user’s location and was sending the information to servers based in Beijing . This entire conclusion was based on reports from other sources. The advisory is nothing serious.” He said similar advisories had been issued before regarding the use of personal computers as well.
So, do IAF personnel carry sensitive information on their smartphone?
“Not really. Cellphones give away user’s location. It is a bit sensitive but we are not at all worried about the operational information being compromised. However, certain inferences could be drawn if any smartphone tracks our personnel’s locations and IAF is not keen on letting others draw such inferences,” said the official.
IAF has its own network based cellphones now, so, the dependence on commercially made mobile phones is slowly reducing. “Even in this IAF network, sensitive information is never communicated,” added the official.

The new Kindle: Good upgrade  but you might miss a backlightPrint
The Kindle is still the best e-reader in the market. The latest version gives you better features at a very affordable Rs 5,999.
Written by Nandagopal Rajan | New Delhi | Posted: October 29, 2014 2:01 pm | Updated: October 29, 2014 2:05 pm
The Kindle e-reader has for the past seven years been the saviour of the written word. While there is no replacement for the trophy value of a book, the Kindle has given bookworms a mobile, viable alternative. Over the years, the Kindle has morphed into many versions adding usability and offering different price points. The latest entry-level Kindle is a upgrade that adds some simple new features.
Design and Readability: The new Kindle does not look much different from the last Kindle or even the Paperwhite. The one big difference that is noticeable is the 6-inch touchscreen, which is now glossy and smooth. It is a bit lighter than before, even with the cover on.
It also has much less glare, even in sunlight. But this does not mean there is no glare at all. I had issues while reading at night and had to get the position right to reduce glare from the tubelight in the room. This version does not come with a backlight and hence you will need a light while reading indoors.
The other big change is the lock screen, which now shows promotions from Amazon. You can click to go directly to the book and purchase — this is most often a book that is at a discounted price. There is also a swipe to unlock option on the lock screen now.
Performance: This Kindle comes with most features you would see on top end version. Yes, you will miss the backlight if you have used a Kindle with one before. But you will also notice that this one is faster than the older version. Page flips are instant and ghosting is reduced. You will see the last page hang around for longer if there were images on it. But this is not an issue with text-only pages.
Even with the experimental browser, this one connect faster to the web than before. In fact, my Paperwhite forget the home network quite often, but I did not face this issue with the new Kindle.
First time users will love the ability to share what you are reading on your social networks, as well as the Goodreads features that show what your friends are reading. While the impatient among us can flip through the pages and come back in an instant. There is also the X-ray feature, that comes in handy when you are reading books with complex plots and far too many characters.
Verdict: The Kindle is still the best e-reader in the market. The latest version gives you better features at a very affordable Rs 5,999, while opening up access to an ever-expanding digital library. If you love books, then this is a must-have. If you can afford it, I suggest you get the Kindle Paperwhite just for the backlight.

News reports do not reflect spirit of my CAG meet speech: Arun JaitleyPrint
Jaitley in his speech had said the government auditor should not sensationalise its findings to get into headlines.
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 30, 2014 5:06 pm | Updated: October 30, 2014 5:15 pm
Under attack over his remarks that official auditor should not “sensationalise” its audit findings, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday said media did not accurately reflect the spirit of his speech at the CAG conference.
“News reports of my speech at the CAG conference do not accurately reflect the spirit of my speech,” Jaitley said in a Facebook post.
The Finance Minister has also uploaded the link of the speech he delivered at the valedictory meet of the annual Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) conference here on Wednesday.
Jaitley in his speech had said the government auditor should not sensationalise its findings to get into headlines.
“Auditor should be conscious of the fact that he is reviewing a decision that has already been taken. Have the fair procedures been followed? He doesn’t have to sensationalise. He doesn’t have to get into the headlines,” he had said.
READ-  A little irony: Don’t hype to hit headlines, Arun Jaitley advises CAG 
Congress leader Digvijay Singh on Thursday took a dig at Jaitley for asking the CAG not to sensationalise its findings to get into headlines.
“CAG should not sensationalise its findings,”- Arun Jaitley. Wish he had realised this when 2G and coal block CAG reports came!”, the Congress General Secretary said on Twitter.
Congress party had voiced similar views in the past after huge notional losses were projected in reports on 2G and coal allocation scams.
Another Congress leader Ajay Maken said his party “strongly condemns” Jaitley’s statement.
“When CAG report used to be leaked even before it was placed before the Parliament, and when the Finance Minister’s party, based on that report, use to disrupt Parliament for days, did he forget that CAG was being sensationalised then also,” Maken said.

Bangalore, October 30:  
Toshiba Corporation has announced that, in collaboration with Electronic Corporation of India Limited (ECIL), it has bagged an order to supply an X-band dual polarization transportable Doppler weather radar system to India Meteorological Department (IMD).
The radar, the first weather radar that Toshiba will supply to outside Japan, will be installed at Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir early January 2015.
Localized catastrophic flooding caused by long or local heavy rainfall is becoming a significant problem, and particularly in India and the ASEAN countries.
Weather radars track cloud movements and can pinpoint the build-up of potentially threatening systems in real time, allowing the authorities to issue warnings and order life-saving evacuations.
Toshiba has been collaborating with ECIL on weather radars since August 2012. The current order follows positive evaluation of their joint proposal, which drew on Toshiba’s extensive experience in supplying weather radars in Japan, and ECIL’s capabilities in supporting operation in the field in India.

ICICI Bank Q2 report card: Higher slippages a concern ICICI Bank Q2 report card: Higher slippages a concern
Radhika Merwin
Tweet
BL Research Bureau:  
ICICI Bank’s net profit grew 15 per cent in the September quarter, on the back of 15 per cent growth in its net interest income. While the bank’s retail focus continues to pay off, driving the overall loan growth, asset quality has witnessed some pressure — an area of concern in recent quarters. Slippages of about Rs 700 crore during the September quarter has been the highest in recent periods.
At a time when its peers such as HDFC Bank and Axis Bank have been able to maintain stable asset quality, ICICI Bank’s higher addition to bad loans is a dampener. HDFC Bank has the lowest loan delinquency with bad loans at 1.02 per cent of loans as of September. While Axis Bank has a higher gross non-performing asset (GNPA) at 1.34 per cent of loans, the bank has been able to keep it steady during the latest September quarter. ICICI Bank’s troubles with bad loans are bigger than that of its peers, with GNPA at 3.12 per cent of loans in the September quarter, up from 3.05 per cent in the June quarter.
Besides the bad loans, ICICI Bank has a larger restructured book too compared with its peers. The bank has been stepping up on its loans recasts over the last year. From about 2.2 per cent last September, ICICI Bank’s restructured book currently accounts for 3 per cent of its loans. Axis Bank’s restructured assets are 2.5 per cent of loans, while HDFC Bank has just 0.1 per cent of its loans recast.
Healthy retail trend
However, ICICI Bank continues to score well on the retail front; its 15 per cent loan growth was led by 25 per cent growth in retail loans. This compares well with the performance of its peers. Axis Bank and HDFC Bank grew retail loans 27 per cent and 17 per cent respectively in the September quarter. ICICI Bank’s strong retail performance augurs well for its profitability and growth. The bank has also been ramping up its low cost CASA (current account savings account) base over the last couple of years. The CASA ratio continues to remain healthy at 43.7 per cent as of September 2014. After achieving its first full-year net interest margin of 3 per cent in 2012-13, the bank has been able to scale it up further to 3.4 per cent in the September quarter.
Given that the overall bank credit slipped to five-year low levels of 9.7 per cent in September, the performance of the three large private banks has been healthy. For ICICI Bank in particular, easing of asset quality pressure over the next year or so will hold the key to the stock’s performance.

Truecaller launches new phone dialerappTruedialer gives instant access to relevant information about contacts that users are trying to dial.
By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Posted: October 30, 2014 5:34 pm | Updated: October 31, 2014 10:35 am
Truecaller has launched a new phone dialer app called Truedialer. The app is available for free on Android and Windows Phone. Truedialer aims to replace the standard dialing interfaces on smartphones and give instant access to relevant information about contacts that users are trying to dial.
If users are dialing a number for an individual or business outside of their phonebook, they’ll be able to see the name, and even a profile photo of whom they’re about to dial before they place the call. The integration of the Truecaller technology works in conjunction with Truedialer.
With the new Truedialer app, users can search for information about a number they are dialing. As a number, dialed, Truedialer searches the contact list and Truecaller’s database to provide the name of an individual or business belonging to a number even if it is not saved in the contact list.
Also, it fills in missing contact information in the call log with information from Truecaller’s database. To prevent spam and scams, if the dialed number has been reported by Truecaller’s community as an unwanted number, the user will be warned before placing the call.
“Until now, phone dial pads have not truly improved since the feature phone days. With the same infrastructure that powers Truecaller, our ambition with Truedialer is to replace the phone’s phonebook app, and be invaluable to users, just as Truecaller has changed the way people receive calls and find contact information,” said Nami Zarringhalam, co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer at Truecaller.

Sugar stocks to remain under pressureRahul Oberoi      Follow @iamrahuloberoi    Edition: October 2014
Photo: Reuters
Stocks of sugar companies have risen 53% in the one year to August. Between 2008 and 2013, they had fallen 16.47% on an average every year. The biggest gainer, DCM Shriram Industries, has risen 306.78% to Rs 120 in the last one year. It is followed by KM Sugar Mills (274.51% to Rs 3.82), Dwarikesh Sugar Industries (148.33% to Rs 37.25), Triveni Engineering & Industries (109.59% to Rs 23.60) and Balrampur Chini Mills (100.14% to Rs 71.65).
"Sugar stocks have rallied due to the recent increase in import duty and hope that the sector will be deregulated. The industry expects that the recommendations of the Rangarajan Committee, which has suggested that cane prices should be 75% of sugar prices, much less than the current price of Rs 210 per quintal, will be implemented. This will ensure that sugar companies again start making profits at the operating level," says Vikram Dhawan, director, Equentis Capital, a Mumbai-based financial services firm.
Sugar is among the very few sectors where the government is involved at every stage, right from fixing the price that mills have to pay farmers for sugarcane to tweaking the various tax rates for price stability. Standoffs over cane pricing between farmers and state governments on the one side and mills on the other are common. The mills complain that while the government sets a fixed price for cane, the price of sugar is determined by market forces, leading to losses.
That is why several investors booked profit in July and August after the country's biggest sugarcane producing state, Uttar Pradesh, said it was not ready to accept the Rangarajan Committee's recommendations. The mills, on their part, found the state-advised price for sugarcane too high and said crushing would be unprofitable at such a high price. The standoff has intensified and the mills are in no mood to crush cane. Sugar stocks fell nearly 21% during these months.
S Ranganathan, head of research, LKP Securities, says, "It makes little sense to invest in the sector as the mills will find it difficult to crush cane if their losses keep mounting. They cannot pay farmers Rs 280 per quintal, the price that has been fixed by the state."
States have the power to fix cane prices above the fair and remunerative price, or FRP, fixed by the Centre. The FRP for 2013-14 is Rs 210 per quintal.
However, Vinay Kumar Agrawal, equity research analyst, WealthRays Securities, says, "Clear policies on imports will drive market sentiment and encourage traders to buy."
Market analysts say among sugar companies, DCM Shriram Industries, KCP Sugar & Industries Corporation and Andhra Sugars can give good returns in the next 12-24 months.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
In the second half of August, the government increased the import duty on sugar from 15% to 25%. The aim was to support the mills by ensuring lower imports and rise in demand for the local produce. But this may not help the mills much.
Arun Thukral, managing director and chief executive officer, Axis Securities, says, "Normally, this would have benefitted sugar companies directly. Since the mills have to pay huge dues to farmers, this will benefit them indirectly by lowering the working capital requirement." The raw sugar export subsidy of Rs 3.30 per kg will also encourage companies to export more so that they can clear farmers' dues.
Most sugar companies, especially those with a big presence in Uttar Pradesh, are under severe financial strain. Many are on the verge of seeking debt restructuring. Some have already done so. In June, banks had given over Rs 4,000 crore as interest-free loans to the mills to clear farmers' arrears. The total amount approved by the government for this is Rs 6,600 crore.
"While these interest-free loans will help the beleaguered industry, we believe that the impact will be marginal at best unless radical policy reforms are carried out," says Dhawan of Equentis Capital.
Gandhi of IIFL Holdings seconds Dhawan. "Bank loans were given to clear farmers' dues. Higher import duty will support prices in the domestic market but we do not expect any meaningful impact on stock prices."
KEY ISSUES
The sugar industry is tightly controlled by the government. Its main problem is the consistent increase in sugarcane prices, which are set by the government, and subdued sugar prices for years now. This has pushed most companies in the red. According to the Indian Sugar Mills Association, the FRP of sugarcane rose 50.9% from Rs 139.12 per quintal in 2010-11 to Rs 210 per quintal in 2013-14. However, sugar prices fell 21% from Rs 3,765 per quintal in January 2010 to Rs 2,962 per quintal in August 2014.
Lower margins have made companies heavily dependent on debt. In 2013-14, the debt-to-equity ratios of Parrys Sugar Industries, Ravalgaon Sugar Farm, Bajaj Hindusthan, EID Parry (India) and Triveni Engineering & Industries were 19.19, 5.03, 2.46, 1.55 and 1.48, respectively. Any figure above one is considered risky.
FACTORS TO WATCH
If you want to invest in sugar stocks, you should ignore companies that have too much debt and operate in regions where political risk is high. Uttar Pradesh, for instance, is known for effecting steep increases in cane prices to please farmers.
"Sugar stocks are extremely volatile and cyclical. For now we will wait for cane pricing issues to be sorted out before investing." says Gandhi of IIFL Holdings.
Government policies should also be tracked. Any sharp rise in sugar prices is not looked at favourably by governments due to its impact on the common man.
REPORT CARD
The bottom line of sugar companies was under severe pressure in 2013-14. Uttam Sugar, Rajshree Sugars & Chemicals, Dhampur Sugar Mills and Dharani Sugars & Chemicals registered net losses of Rs 66.94 crore, Rs 34.36 crore, Rs 78.35 and Rs 33.79 crore, respectively. They had made decent profits in 2013-12.
"The uncertainty over pricing keeps sugar companies under pressure. Lack of flexibility on pricing does not augur well for them. The recent rise in import duty will improve the business environment. But prices will not rise steeply as the government is keen to check inflation. A small improvement can be seen in the coming quarters," says Thukral of Axis Securities.
SWEET BETS
Andhra Sugars
Andhra Sugars
Andhra Sugars is one of the few sugar companies that reported a profit in 2013-14. It made a consolidated net profit of Rs 65 crore, down 26% from Rs 89 crore in 2012-13. Vinay Kumar Agrawal, Equity Research Analyst, WealthRays Securities, is bullish on the stock. "This stock could give better returns than others and touch Rs 210-220."
KCP Ltd
KCP Ltd
One can invest in KCP over a period of 24 months, says S Ranganathan, head of research, LKP Securities. KCP is a diversified business group with interests in heavy engineering, sugar, cement, hydel power, information technology and biotechnology. The company registered a net profit of Rs 49.93 crore in 2013-14, down 41% from Rs 85.04 crore last year. The stock rose 115% in the one year to August 28. "The company produces and sells in Vietnam, where prices are remunerative and cane prices are reasonable due to which operations are very profitable. KCP's 2.5 million tonnes cement plant in Andhra Pradesh is reviving after many years with infrastructure and construction activities picking up in Telangana and Seemandhara. Also, cement prices have risen to Rs 315 per bag from Rs 280 per bag in the last one year. KCP's engineering division is one of the best in the country and will be a key beneficiary of the revival in the investment cycle over the next two years. A trustworthy management and combination of three strong business verticals makes KCP an excellent investment bet for a two-year price target of Rs 150." It was at Rs 56.25 on September 15.

India most bullish consumer mkt: NielsenGlobal consumer confidence improves, India most bullish market, says Nielsen survey

Consumer confidence in the United States jumped in the third quarter and improved globally, although people were more optimistic about job prospects than their personal finances, a survey showed on Wednesday.
India remained the most bullish consumer market, while Italy became the most pessimistic, according to the survey by global information and insights company Nielsen.
The survey showed that concerns about the economy and job prospects had eased globally from the second quarter, but in North America and Europe that had been replaced by rising worries about war and terrorism.
European countries generally were the most pessimistic, reflecting the conflict in Ukraine, faltering growth and the risk of deflation in the euro zone. Britain and Germany, however, saw consumer confidence improve.
The Nielsen Global Consumer Confidence Index rose 1 point in the third quarter to 98, according to the survey, conducted between August 13 and September 5.
The index has been steadily rising since the first quarter of 2012 and the latest reading headed closer to the 100 mark that signals optimism among consumers.
US consumers were the seventh most upbeat globally, with their score rising 4 points to 108 as optimism about job prospects continued to surge.
Americans were also slightly more upbeat about the outlook for their personal finances than they were in the second quarter, unlike Europeans, who were more pessimistic, reflecting persistently low wage growth.
"US consumers are now feeling far more confident than in previous years of the recovery due to consistently good job market trends, reflected in steady payroll growth and falling unemployment over the course of 2014," said Louise Keely, a senior vice president at Nielsen.
"They are also benefiting from lower gasoline prices and a gradually improving housing market. In the coming months, as we start to see more people re-entering the workforce and meaningful wage growth, this is likely to translate into broad-based gains in consumer spending."
Australia saw the biggest increase in confidence from the previous quarter, by 12 points, followed by Slovenia with a 9-point increase and Thailand with 8 points.
Chile posted the sharpest drop in confidence, by 7 points, followed by the Philippines with a 5-point decline and 4-point decreases for Italy and Ukraine.
The Nielsen survey was conducted online and covered more than 30,000 consumers across 60 markets.

Aircel-Maxis case: Court summons Maran brothersComments
A special court on Wednesday summoned former telecom minister Dayanidhi Maran and others in the 2006 Aircel-Maxis deal — as part of the larger 2G spectrum allocation scam case — asking them to appear before it on March 2 next year.
Presiding over the case, special court judge OP Saini said he had gone through the chargesheet filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and found enough incriminating material to go ahead with the prosecution.
The CBI filed the chargesheet in August, saying they had evidence that Maran, his brother Kalanithi Maran, Malaysian businessman T Ananda Krishnan and four others were involved in the dubious deal where Krishnan allegedly paid over Rs. 3,390 crore for 74% equity in cellular services company Aircel. The telecom ministry granted Aircel licences to operate in 14 cash-rich circles.
“I have carefully gone through the copy of the first information report, chargesheet, statements of witnesses and related documents comprised in the voluminous record of the case,” the judge said. “I am satisfied that there is enough incriminating material on the record to proceed against the accused person.”
The CBI in its chargesheet said the former telecom minister used his influence to help Krishnan acquire Aircel by coercing its owner C Sivasankaran to part with his stake. The investigating agency booked all accused under charges of criminal conspiracy and under provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.
Sivasankaran alleged that Maran favoured the Maxis Group in the takeover of his company, saying Maxis in return, made investments through Astro Network in a company owned by the Maran family.
Four companies — Chennai-based Sun Direct TV, UK-based Astro All Asia Networks, Maxis Communications Berhad of Malaysia and the South Asia Entertainment Holdings of Mauritius — have been also named in the CBI chargesheet.

Are e-tailers going all out on TV advertisingStory
Jostling for Eyeballs

E-tailers going overboard on TV advertising
During the recent Navaratri festivities, a character in a popular fiction show on Star Plus, Yeh Hai Mohabbatein, was shown shopping online for gifts for her family. She buys a piece of jewellery for her daughter from Amazon, the online retailer. She goes on to educate her daughter about the various facets of online shopping - ease of shopping, cash on delivery and so on. All this was woven into the script of the show.
Similarly, the contestants of reality show Bigg Boss, on Viacom 18's general entertainment channel Colors, were seen buying household items such as refrigerators, microwaves and mattresses on Snapdeal.com's Diwali Bumper Sale.
Indeed, as these examples illustrate, e-tailers such as Amazon , Flipkart and Snapdeal, are spending a fortune on television advertising. This is a throwback to 1999-2000 when dotcoms had raised a lot of money from venture capitalists and were spending heavily on advertising.
The advertising splurge this year is also because it is now a three-way fight to be the dominant e-tailer in the country, and all three - Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon India - have deep-pocketed backers who are going all out to win this battle. Broadcasters claim that e-tailers have been one of the largest contributors to their advertising revenue this year. "From just four per cent (of total advertising spends on TV) last year, advertising spends of e-tailers has gone up to 12 per cent this year, making them the third-largest spenders on television," says Rohit Gupta, President, Multi Screen Media (MSM), which runs the Sony channels. The largest contributors continue to be fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies with spends in the region of 35 to 40 per cent of the total advertising pie. Telecom and consumer durable companies contribute around 18 to 20 per cent each.
A 10-second spot on Sony's game show Kaun Banega Crorepati costs around Rs 6 lakh and Snapdeal has gone in for an in-show integration. It has a Snapdeal-branded question on the show for which it would have to pay a premium of anywhere between 25 to 30 per cent. "E-tailers are increasingly opting for in-show brand integrations. In Bigg Boss for instance, we even had the Snapdeal delivery boys coming into the Bigg Boss house and delivering the merchandise," says Simran Hoon, National Sales Head, Colors.
Snapdeal's marketing spends have shot up in sync with the multi-fold growth of the business. These kind of integrations convey the message that shopping on Snapdeal's online marketplace is convenient with a wide variety of products available, says Sandeep Komaravelly, Senior Vice President, (Marketing), Snapdeal.
T. Gangadhar, Managing Director of GroupM's media agency MEC, says that e-tailers spend on above the line advertising is justified, especially at a time when they are looking at smaller markets. "The next wave of growth will come from smaller towns and television and print platforms are the best way to reach out to these consumers," he points out.
A typical brick-and-mortar retailer , such as Big Bazaar or Reliance Trends, advertises aggressively only during festivals. However, analysts believe that e-tailers, like the FMCG companies, will continue to advertise round the year. "Advertising becomes crucial for an e-tailer as that's the only way it can make its consumers aware of its products. They are not brick and mortar stores where one can walk in and touch and feel the products," points out Jagat Dave, Managing Director at Ambit Corporate Finance, an investment bank.
Not all e-tailers are going overboard on advertising. eBay, which has been around for nine years in India, doesn't feel the need to splurge on television. "There was an era where people needed to be educated about online shopping. But I think we've passed that phase and now it's more about how you convert people who are already online and make them online users," says eBay India's marketing head, Shivani Dhanda.
In fact, Devangshu Dutta, CEO of retail consultancy, ThirdEyeSight, believes these e-tailers are splurging because they are flush with cash. "They have a lot of capital and they are trying to grab as much land share as quickly as possible. So, they are trying all kinds of advertising and are hoping it works."
How long will the e-tailers be able to sustain their advertising spree? Ambit's Dave expects ad spends to increase because, he says, investors in e-tailers have also budgeted a huge amount for advertising. But not everyone agrees. Snapdeal is known to have posted a loss of close to Rs 300 crore in the last quarter itself and the financials of the rest of players are supposed to be no better. A lot will depend on whether these companies will continue to get as much funding from venture capital funds and private equity players as they are getting now. Clearly, if they continue to rack up losses, funds are bound to dry up and so will advertising.

Snapdeal eyes acquisitions  $3bn in transactions by DecemberComments
A day after SoftBank chairman Masayoshi Son called it the Alibaba of India, Snapdeal on Wednesday revealed plans to acquire technology companies on its way to clocking an annual rate of sales or gross merchandise value (GMV) of $3 billion by December.
Armed with a cash chest of $800 million — $627 million from SoftBank — Snapdeal also plans to hire over 1,000 techies and set up a development centre in Bangalore.
“This is a phase of acceleration and we want to make significant investments in technology in the next few years,” Snapdeal founder and CEO Kunal Bahl told HT.
GMV is the annualised value of merchandise sold on an e-commerce company’s website, which is generally considered a measure of growth. Snapdeal’s bigger rival Flipkart said early this month that it crossed $ 3-billion GMV and expects to touch $5 billion by March 2016.
Flipkart was the first Indian e-commerce company to cross $ 1-billion GMV in March this year, followed by Snapdeal. Online retailers are constantly revising their GMV projections upwards, a sign of the industry’s rapid growth.
However, companies are yet to make profits since they give huge discounts to bump up sales. “If we want to break-even we can do it in two quarters. But that is not the focus right now,” Bahl said. “We have so far spent $ 100 million and have 8-fold of that amount in bank,” he said.
He said the company would hire 1,000 engineers, taking its technology force to 1,500 by next year. “We are setting up our new development centre in Bangalore in the next two-three weeks. We will hire 500 engineers in Bangalore alone. Senior engineers from companies such as Yahoo are joining us,” Bahl said.
About the company’s plans to list on bourses, Bahl said: “Our board will continue to explore the right time to go public. I don’t think any of our investors would want us to go public in a hurry.”
“Be it SoftBank, Azim Premji or Ratan Tata, they all have long-term vision. SoftBank waited 16 years for Alibaba to go public,” he added.
Snapdeal currently has 30 million users and 50,000 sellers on its platform and aims to have a million small businesses selling on its site in the next three years, emulating the Alibaba model of providing a platform for scores of small traders and manufacturers. When asked about the feasibility of having a 20-fold growth on seller base in 36 months, Bahl said, “Two-and-a-half years back we had no sellers.”
About the fierce three-way competition among Flipkart, Amazon and Snapdeal, he said, “We are the fastest growing e-commerce company in the country. The SoftBank investment is a validation of that.”

Economists  pvt sector officials may bag top posts in govt companiesEconomists, pvt sector officials may bag top posts in govt companies

Private sector executives, technocrats and top economists may soon find their way to coveted slots in public sector units and government departments.
Official sources said a new policy is being framed by the Department of Personnel & Training (DoPT) following instructions from the PMO to rope in professionals and private sector heavyweights with sound managerial experience in government-run institutions and offices including crucial economic and technology-focused ministries.
“While bringing in experience, the move is also aimed at reducing corruption,” the official said.
In a recent interview to HT, Piyush Goyal, minister of power, coal and renewable energy,  had voiced similar intentions of widening the selection criteria to get professionals and management gurus from the private sector.
Sectoral expertise may not be considered as the only criteria for such appointments. “There is no need to have a mining expert as the chairman of Coal India... rather a person with managerial skills and a decent knowledge of mining could prove to be a best fit for the post,” another senior government official said.
It is not an unusual practice to hire corporate heavyweights and even the guidelines of Public Enterprises Selection Board, government’s head-hunter, do not prohibit private individuals from applying for posts in central PSUs.
Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani (as head of the the Unique Identification Authority of India), former Boston Consulting Group chairman Arun Maira (as a member in the Plan panel) and former BSES MD RV Shahi (as union power secretary) are cases in point. All three, however, had relinquished their corporate roles before coming joining government organisations.
IMF economist Raghuram Rajan joined as governor of Reserve Bank of India, a post long dominated by former IAS officers.
NTPC CMD Arup Roy Choudhury welcomed such a move. “Countries like the US follow a similar practice... specialists and experts should be inducted and this will add a lot of value and credibility to the functioning of the government in a fair and transparent manner,” he said.

Rupee trims initial losses on capital inflowsRupee drops to 2-wk low after Fed sticks to low rates

Moving in an opposite direction to stocks, the rupee on Thursday fell for the fourth day, dipping 10 paise to close at two-week low of 61.45 against the Greenback after US Federal Reserve kept in place its plans to maintain record low interest rate for some more time.
While the Fed's bond buying programme came to an end as expected, the continuation of ultra low interest rate regime lifted the dollar overseas against major currencies, thereby keeping the rupee under pressure, a forex dealer said.
At the Interank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market, the domestic unit commenced sharply lower at 61.52 a dollar from previous close of 61.35. It later moved in a narrow range of 61.39 and 61.55 before concluding at 61.45, showing a fall of 10 paise or 0.21 per cent.
In four days, the rupee has dipped by 21 paise or 0.37 per cent to end at its weakest level since October 16 (61.83).
The Indian benchmark S&P BSE Sensex on Thursday spurted by 248.16 points, or 0.92 per cent, to end at all-time high of 27,346.33. FIIs bought shares worth USD 123.13 million on Wednesday, as per Sebi data.
The dollar index was trading higher by 0.26 per cent against its major global rivals after Fed Wednesday made official its plans to end the last round of its recession-era stimulus programme while reiterating its stance of keeping its interest rate low.
Pramit Brahmbhatt, Veracity Group CEO said: "Rupee traded weak as month-end dollar demand from importers. However, rupee trimmed its initial losses on good foreign capital inflows into equity market....The trading range for the Spot USD/INR pair is expected to be within 60.90 to 61.90."
The depreciation of the rupee was limited as investors believe that the Indian markets have been performing fairly better than other countries, said Suresh Nair, Director, Admisi Forex India Pvt Ltd.

India s road to become manufacturing majorStory
A Formidable Task

In the right direction: A production line at Maruti's Manesar factory.
Six months is a long time. It is nearly the time a trip to Mars would take, according to Mars One, a not-for-profit foundation that seeks to establish a permanent human settlement on the planet whose average distance from the Earth is 225 million km. It is also the time a 1,622-km-long road journey in India could take.
Two years ago, heavy engineering company ISGEC was transporting three consignments of column - process equipment weighing between 53 metric tonnes and 158 metric tonnes, and six meters high - from its factory in Gujarat's Dahej to the Jindal Steel & Power plant in Angul, Odisha. Along the way, the company faced three railway shutdowns, made five detours where roads were being built, trimmed 100 trees after local permissions because of the column's height, and removed and reinstated 200 overhead power cables. It also paid off villagers a dozen times to allow the consignment to pass, and its drivers and supervisors were manhandled 13 times. The road barely existed in the last 100 km. The equipment was delivered in 180 days.
This journey tells the tale of making in India - manufacturers everyday face headwinds due to poor infrastructure, lack of environment clearances, local trouble, and slow decision making. Add labour trouble, land issues and taxation bottlenecks and you have a sector that is deep in the woods.

It recovered to 13.14 per cent in 2013 and to 32.28 per cent this year. Also, the number of manufacturing companies in the BT 500 list shrank from 236 in 2009 to 202 in 2013, before recovering to 215 in 2014.

This is not all. Manufacturing's share in the country's gross domestic product has fallen in recent years, from a high of 16.28 per cent in 2011/12 to 14.94 per cent in 2013/14. And latest data continues to indicate a slowdown - manufacturing output fell 1.4 per cent in August from a year earlier because of a lack of new orders. In a quarterly survey in August, industry lobby FICCI said 71 per cent manufacturing units didn't have plans for capacity addition for next six months with capacity utilisation remaining stagnant thus far. More than 64 per cent said they may not hire additional workforce in next three months, according to the survey.

It is in this context that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's high decibel 'Make In India' campaign is so refreshing to many industrialists. On September 25, he unveiled the campaign's logo - a striding lion made of cog-wheels - and promised manufacturers "effective governance", not just "good governance". The campaign has three pillars: making it easier to do business by removing licensing and regulatory hurdles, enabling infrastructure such as industrial corridors, and opening up foreign direct investment in a number of sectors including defence, construction and railways. The National Manufacturing Policy aims to create 100 million jobs by 2022 and increase the share of manufacturing in India's GDP to 25 per cent.
Still, investors, like the FICCI survey hinted, remain cautious and are on a wait-and-watch mode. Modi is going in the right direction, they say, but they want more than just assurances.
CROUCHING LION
For 'Make in India' to succeed, the government needs to address the concerns of three sets of manufacturers - existing investors, those who want to expand in India, and foreign investors. Existing investors who have suffered setbacks because of recent court rulings need a high dose of the confidence opium.
"The private sector in India feels highly insecure. The government is not consistent, (and) a lot of reversals take place," says Ravi Uppal, Managing Director and Group CEO of Jindal Steel & Power. "Today, people are questioning the validity of any document given by the government. It comes to saying that any document given by the government must be endorsed by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, the Central Vigilance Commission, the Central Bureau of Investigation, and finally the Supreme Court before it becomes a valid document," he adds.
The Supreme Court recently cancelled the permits of 214 coal blocks allocated without auction between 1993 and 2010 by various governments. Miners have time till March 31, 2015, to hand over the mines to the government. Jindal Steel is one such company caught between a rock and a hard place. "We employ 30,000 people in our mines. They will be laid off," says Uppal. The company will not just face disruptions in coal supply, but also has a total investment of `36,000 crore at stake. "The opportunity lost will be in terms of future investment," he says.
The Modi government has to win back this fast receding investor confidence. "There needs to be consistency in government policy. There must be a legislation to say that when government decisions are made, they cannot be questioned. This kind of protection must be given," stresses Uppal.
Existing investors in India also need protection against outdated labour laws. Labour unions inside factories have been resorting to strikes and sabotage to press for higher wages and reverse disciplinary measures. In 2012, automaker Maruti Suzuki's Manesar plant faced a nasty labour strife, culminating in a management representative being charred to death. Another case in point is Parle Products's Bangalore factory. The company applied for closure of the plant after it could function for just three and half months between 2011 and 2013. Workers had halted production after an employee was suspended for abusing a personnel officer.
Toyota Kirloskar Motor faced similar problems this year. Between February 10 and March 15, the union at the carmaker led the disruption of shop-floor operations at its factory near Bangalore 32 times, resulting in a production loss of 1,988 vehicles, which led the company to declare a lockout. The lockout was subsequently lifted and management was eventually able to enforce discipline. "We cannot allow a minority to hold the majority to ransom," says Shekar Viswanathan, Vice Chairman and Director at Toyota Kirloskar Motor. "The labour department has to play a keen and instructive role, fostering better relations with management. Labour is a state subject. Every chief minister, labour secretary and junior functionary in the department must say we cannot compromise on discipline. It is management's right to enforce it," he adds.

Labour reform, agrees Surinder Kapur, Chairman of auto parts maker Sona Group, is needed to improve India's competitiveness. He says workforce in India is not disciplined enough. "In most factories, people are not working for eight hours. It varies from five to seven hours," he says. India's output per worker, at $3,067 in 2013, is nearly half of China's, according to the International Labour Organization.
In particular, industry groups and companies have been lobbying for a change in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. The Act mandates companies employing 100 or more workers to seek prior permission of the government for firing workers. Chapter V B of the Act bars companies from shutting shop or downsizing quickly - a company needs to seek permission from the government three months in advance. This locks up capital in unproductive assets. "Small and medium enterprises need to be given a holiday from labour laws for the next seven years, " says Kapur. "That's the kind of impetus you need."
A small start has already been made in this direction. On October 16, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched five initiatives under a new scheme titled Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Shramev Jayate Karyakram to address some of these problems. The initiatives include simplifying compliance of 16 labour laws through a single online form and a transparent Labour Inspection Scheme aimed at ending undue harassment by factory inspectors.
HANDLE THE ELEPHANT, TOO

Anyone, say manufacturers, can delay projects in India. In his Delhi office, replete with horse sketches, Puneet Dalmia narrates a tale of how a non-governmental organisation (NGO) threw a spanner in the works two years ago. The Managing Director of Dalmia Bharat Cement recalls that, at one of the company's greenfield projects, a local NGO claimed the road connecting its plant to the main road was in forest land. The company was dumbstruck because there was no forest there. But the NGO argued the region was an elephant track. "As a solution, the NGO wanted funding for elephant conservation. They came up with a `4 crore budget, saying they need to buy jeeps and laptops," says Dalmia. The company did not pay up but created an underpass for the animals to cross, if at all.
Often, projects get delayed also because some land owners don't want to sell their plots. "You may need to do 1,500 transactions to complete the entire land purchase since land holdings are small in India. You don't get contiguous land," says Dalmia. "There are patches that remain unsold. If you are stuck because of a small plot, you pay a hefty price. Then others who sold land a year back also come back to negotiate. This has happened many a time."
In the company's project costs, the maximum inflation has been in the price of land - 20 to 35 per cent a year across states. Dalmia Bharat Cement has operations in 14 states.
Other manufacturers face similar problems in land acquisition, which could lead to changes in business plans. German agro-equipment maker Lemken wanted to set up a plant in Pune in 2008 and was hunting for 20,000 square meters of land as the city had good infrastructure and skilled manpower, says CEO Arvind Kumar. But the company couldn't find a plot of land and finally went to Nagpur to set up the factory.
All these come at a time when foreign countries are aggressively looking to generate employment and are eyeing Indian investment. Apollo Tyres, for instance, is setting up a factory in Hungary that would employ 900. "We were chased by a number of countries - Slovakia, Poland, Hungary," says Onkar Kanwar, Chairman and Managing Director of Apollo Tyres. "We selected Hungary because our belief has been always to have a plant close to facilities where you know people can live and work properly. It's a one-and-a-half hour drive from Budapest." Kanwar is hesitant to link his expansion in Europe to the difficulty of getting things done in India but says land prices in India have become exorbitant. "Where we used to pay `10 lakh an acre, the same land is available for `1 crore now," he adds.
Adi Godrej, Chairman of the Godrej Group, points to a "funny law" that prohibits development of land under the Coastal Regulation Zones. "All coastal cities are badly affected by this - no other country in the world has such a law. Things like land reclamation is becoming difficult in India... All these come in the way of manufacturing development," he says.
Doing business has become tougher in the past few years, he adds. Too many permissions are required from too many agencies, and there are delays in environment clearances and land acquisition. To set up a cement plant, for instance, it takes 43 clearances from different agencies. "It becomes extremely complicated," says Godrej.
SO WHAT CAN MODI DO?
Godrej's solution - minimal permissions from the government, be it the state or the centre. "The government should have an adequate land bank. Simplification is the key to getting it done. The law of the land should be that if a certain permission is not granted within a certain period, say three months, then it is assumed to have been granted," he suggests.
Intricately linked to the high cost of land and the complexity of operating in India is the high cost of financing a project. Manufacturers want the government to relax lending norms. For instance, a steel plant of one million tonnes costs $1 billion and banks require promoter equity of 25 per cent for lending. "The promoter must have $250 million. Not many people have that kind of cash," says Uppal of Jindal Steel. "The government should have a guideline that says banks can go up to 90 per cent lending."
'Employment comes from manufacturing. Unfortunately, in the last 10 years, there has been a lot of talk, but no action. The result is we are stuck at 15 per cent (of GDP) in manufacturing,' says Onkar Kanwar, Chairman and Managing Director, Apollo Tyres. Picture: Shekhar Ghosh
Most domestic banks, laden with bad loans, may not agree with Uppal. But in many countries lending norms are easier and interest rates lower than in India, which works to the advantage of multinational companies. Jindal Steel, for instance, has set up a two-million-tonne steel plant in Oman. "Banks gave us money with a smile with favourable terms. The cost of loan is six per cent. In dollar terms, the rate is less than five per cent. India is at 12 per cent," says Uppal.
Smaller companies are being asked for personal guarantees by banks, says Kapur of Sona Group. "The stumbling block in automotive is that Tier-II and Tier-III suppliers are not growing at the pace they should because they are not being funded by banks. If suppliers don't grow, the alternative would be imports to overcome shortage. There is a cost to it," he adds. His company is taking vendors to banks, explaining to bankers that they need loans to operate.
S.V. Sukumar, Partner and Head of Strategy and Operations Practice at KPMG in India, says India must also ensure protection of intellectual property rights to boost manufacturing. "If high-end manufacturing comes to India, design will too. There must be protection for multinational companies R&D," he says.
INDIA SAFARI CUT SHORT
Foreign direct investors don't face a cash crunch. They have other headaches. Over the past few years, Indias income tax department has slapped tax evasion notices against multinationals ranging from Vodafone and Nokia to Shell India and General Electric. "Tax terrorism", a term that gained popularity in the run-up to general elections this year, includes retrospective taxation and claims on withholding tax. Both have earned India a bad name.
In 2012, the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government amended a law to retrospectively tax deals between any two companies if the underlying assets were in India, affecting mobile-phone operator Vodafone that had bought Hong Kong-based Hutchison Group's stake in Hutchison Essar. Similarly, Nokia has been slapped with two tax cases totalling `17,658 crore, and the implication has been disastrous for Indian manufacturing, employees and a growing electronic assembly ecosystem in Chennai. Nokia's Sriperumbudur factory, once the world's largest mobile-phone plant with 8,000 permanent employees producing 15 million handsets a month, will down shutters on November 1.
In February this year, the Tamil Nadu Sales Tax department slapped a tax case accusing Nokia of not having exported any of the mobile phones it manufactured at the plant between 2009 and 2011. "We find this claim surprising since we have customs documentation showing we exported more than 400 million phones during that period," a Nokia spokesperson had told Business Today earlier.
The second dispute relates to withholding tax. The Income Tax Department claimed `15,258 crore in unpaid taxes, interest and penalties as Nokia India showed the payments made for buying software from its head office in Finland as 'purchase transactions', not 'royalty payments'. While tax experts, such as Sanjay Sanghvi, Tax Partner at Khaitan & Co, say there was no tax liability in a purchase transaction concluded outside the country, authorities treated Nokia as a defaulter. Authorities also froze the company's manufacturing assets, preventing a transfer to Microsoft, which announced acquisition of Nokia's devices and services business in 2013. Nokia let go most of its employees and the plant became a contract manufacturer for Microsoft. The US-based company recently informed the handset maker it will terminate their manufacturing services pact from November 1, prompting Nokia to suspend production at the plant.
Brett Young, a corporate communications executive at Nokia Corporation, told BT the asset freeze by the tax department prevents the handset maker from exploring potential opportunities to sell the factory to any other company. "Nokia is now evaluating options to minimize the impact on the over 1,100 employees remaining at the manufacturing facility," he said in an e-mailed response. To attract investments, said Young, India should up set fast-tracks courts to resolve disputes and end practices that do more harm than good to all stakeholders - asset freezes being one example. "It is also critical to quickly resolve existing tax disputes sparked by retrospective taxation policy shifts. Companies that have operated with the same business model for many years, and have been regularly assessed and audited by the tax authorities, should be able to expect a reliable and consistent business environment," Young said.
But until India creates such an environment, manufacturing will resemble a lamb - not a lion. There is much work to be done before the cogs start to turn.

Modi govt s austerity drive: No 5-star hotel meetings  first-class flights for bureaucratsComments
The Narendra Modi government on Thursday ordered a ban on first-class air travel by top bureaucrats as part of its austerity drive to cut down on unnecessary expenditure and make the most of available resources.

The government also told ministries to reduce non-plan expenditure, barring them from making new financial commitments, purchasing new vehicles, creating new posts and holding conferences at five-star hotels.
Government expenditure is classified under two broad heads — plan and non-plan. Funds spent on creating assets through programmes and schemes come under plan expenditure, while non-plan expenditure refers to all spending, including establishment and maintenance activities of the government and the small-bore measures are aimed at cutting discretionary spending by 10% in the fiscal year to March 2015.
“In the context of the current fiscal situation, there is a need to continue to rationalise expenditure and optimise available resources,” said an order issued by expenditure secretary RN Watal that clamped down on secretaries flying first-class while travelling abroad. Last year’s austerity drive had advised them to avoid first-class travel, but quite a few ignored the suggestion.
Containing expenditure is central to the government’s aim to keep the fiscal deficit — shorthand for the amount of money the government borrows to fund its expenses — within the budgeted 4.1% of GDP in 2014-15.
The move comes a month after Prime Minister Modi frowned at secretary-rank officers going on frequent foreign trips, saying they should travel only if sending a joint secretary- or additional secretary-rank officer does not serve the purpose.
However, the government made a few changes to earlier versions of the austerity drive to avoid unnecessary inconvenience and paperwork. For instance, it exempted security forces from the ban on buying new vehicles.
In the past, security forces had to seek the finance ministry’s approval for every purchase. “This rule was a big impediment and slowed down our expansion,” said a central reserve police force officer.
The finance ministry also relaxed the rule forcing all officers except secretaries to travel by economy-class, which will now allow officers of the rank of joint secretary and above to travel business-class. The ministry, while striking down the earlier rule that was often criticised as unnecessary, said departments would, however, not be given any more money than what is already budgeted.
“However, there would no bookings in first-class,” Watal’s memorandum said.
The government will also not entertain proposals for participation in study tours or conferences abroad except those that are fully funded by the sponsoring agencies.

ACC Ltd clocks 62% rise in Q2 net profitACC Ltd clocks 62% rise in net profit in Q2
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: October 30, 2014  | 17:46 IST
Cement manufacturer ACC Ltd on Thursday reported a whopping 62 per cent rise in its consolidated net profit for July-September quarter at Rs 192.60 crore on better cost management and improved realisations.
The company, which follows January-December as accounting year in line with its majority stakeholder Holcim, had reported Rs 118.90 crore net profit in the same quarter last year.
"Profitability during the quarter showed an improvement as a result of our customer excellence programme and better cost management, particularly with regard to distribution costs and optimised sourcing of inputs and improved realisations," ACC Ltd said in a statement.
Turnover of the company, with prospects of economy gradually picking up leaving a positive impact on cement demand, rose to 2,741.87 crore from Rs 2,505.44 crore during the same quarter a year earlier.
Sales volume increased though marginally to 5.62 million tonnes (MT) during the July-September quarter of the current year compared to 5.54 MT during the same quarter last year.
Operating EBITDA rose to Rs 379 crore against Rs 286.56 crore in the same period of the previous year, it said.
"With prospects of the economy gradually picking up, the infrastructure, housing and construction sectors are expected to register growth in the near term which will have a positive impact on demand for cement," ACC Ltd said.
The company said its subsidiary ACC Mineral Resources had participated in four 49:51 joint ventures with Madhya Pradesh State Mining Corporation (MPSMCL) for development and mining of four coal blocks allocated to MPSMCL.
These blocks now stand cancelled following cancellation of blocks by the Supreme Court last month. ACC Ltd said the financial loss or operational impact as a result, if any, would not be significant.

Black money: 10 developments you must knowsince Modi government took chargeComments
The Centre has submitted a list of 627 Indians who have accounts in HSBC bank, Geneva, to the Supreme Court on Wednesday, directing a special investigation team (SIT) to complete the tax probe on suspected black money by March next year.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi says he wants to prosecute tax dodgers and bring money stashed in tax havens back into the country but his opponents claim enough progress has not been made since his landslide election victory earlier this year.
Here's the ten developments since the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government took charge at the Centre in May this year:
1. May 27: Modi govt forms SIT
Signalling his government’s resolve to bring back the country’s black money stashed abroad, PM Modi’s first decision in the maiden meeting of his cabinet was to form a high-profile SIT to unearth illicit money.
The SIT is headed by former SC judge MB Shah and includes the highest-level officials from financial and economic departments as well as law enforcement agencies.
The decision came just a day before the apex court’s deadline to form the SIT was set to expire.
2. Oct 17: 'Black money info cannot be disclosed to all'
The Centre on October 17 told the SC that it could not disclose the names of those who have deposited money in banks abroad as it this would jeopardise tax agreements with nations providing those names to India.
This echoes the line taken by the previous United Progressive Alliance government, which the BJP had slammed over alleged inaction on the issue and made it into an election issue earlier this year.
Appearing before a bench headed by Chief Justice HL Dattu, Attorney general Mukul Rohatgi said that all amounts deposited in foreign banks by Indian citizens cannot be termed black money and that it is not a crime to open such accounts.
However, finance minister Arun Jaitley rejected any notion that the BJP was reluctant to make the names public.
3. Oct 17: FM says Switzerland agrees to provide details of black money
Jaitley said that Switzerland had agreed to share information on Indians’ bank accounts on independent evidence provided in each case, marking a major step in efforts to secure data from the Alpine nation, known for its banking secrecy laws.
Jaitley said Switzerland had agreed to share information related to HSBC and Liechestein lists of account holders, provided there is independent evidence collected by Indian authorities.
As per Swiss National Bank's latest data, the total money held by Indians in Swiss banks stood at over Rs. 14,000 crore as on December 2013, up by nearly 42% from a year ago.
4. Oct 27: Govt discloses eight names to SC
Days after it was criticised for backtracking on its election promise to bring back black money stashed abroad, the Modi government named seven persons and a company facing prosecution for keeping illegal wealth in foreign banks.
The much-awaited list did not include names of any politician. Those named in a government affidavit were Pradip Burman of the Dabur group, Rajkot-based bullion trader Pankaj Chimanlal Lodhya and directors of Goa-based mining company Timblo Private Limited — Radha Satish Timblo, Chetan S Timblo, Rohan S Timblo, Anna C Timblo and Mallika R Timblo. Timblo Private Limited, a firm identified by Association for Democratic Reforms as a donor to both the BJP and the Congress, was also named.
5. Oct 27: Oppn slams BJP for calling affidavit historic
Political reactions were sharp after the government revealed the names of seven persons and a company facing prosecution for keeping illegal wealth in foreign banks.
Sambit Patra, a BJP spokesperson, called disclosure of the names "a historic day in the black money case".
But Congress general secretary Digvijaya Singh accused the BJP of "selective revelation" of names and said the process smacked of "blackmail, not black money".
AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal said the revelations of black money account holders should not be selective. "There should not be selective revelation of names. The big fish are being let off," he told the media.
Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi cited four tweets by Modi before the Lok Sabha elections in which he had slammed the previous Manmohan Singh government for its “lack of commitment” to bring back black money from foreign banks.
6. Oct 28: SC pulls up Centre
The apex court directed the government to submit to it the names of all foreign bank account holders by Oct 29, saying it need not provide a “protective umbrella” to such persons.
The court also turned down the government’s request that it modify its order seeking the names of all such account holders. The Centre had contended that the names should be revealed only after investigations proved the accounts indeed held black money and led to prosecution against tax evaders.
7. Oct 29: Centre gives black money full list to SC
The government submitted a list of 627 Indians holding accounts in HSBC Bank, Geneva, to the court, which directed its SIT to examine them and take appropriate action.
After handing over a sealed envelope, attorney general Mukul Rohatgi said it contained three documents — the government’s correspondence with the French government, the list of names and a status report.
8. Oct 29: No revelation, for now
A special bench of the apex court headed Dattu refused to open the envelope handing over by the Centre, saying it would be done by the SIT chairman and vice-chairman.
“We don’t want to open these papers and embarrass anyone. That has never been our intention,” it said.
Scheduling the next hearing for December 3, it asked the SIT to submit a status report by November 30 after ascertaining who had black money accounts abroad.
9. Oct 29: State of confusion
On Tuesday, the top court directed the government to submit the full list after the latter said it wasn’t possible to make the names of all foreign bank account holders public. Rejecting the Centre’s submission, the CJI said, “If it breaches confidentiality, let it be so.”
But on Wednesday, the court refused to open the sealed envelope which contained the list of foreign account holders.
It was also not clear why the court insisted on getting the list from the government when the latter had submitted it to the court-appointed SIT in June.
The Centre, meanwhile, was allowed by the court to raise its objections against making all the names public before the SIT.
10. Oct 30: What's next
The SC-appointed SIT, looking into the black money cases, on Thursday said it will go after the offenders "big or small" but made it clear that confidentiality about account holders abroad will not be violated.
It also said it was gathering more names other than the over 600 account holders in HSBC bank, Geneva, given by the government to the apex court on Wednesday, for investigation.
"Before us, nobody is big, nobody is small. Everybody is equal. Whoever has looted this country will be caught and will be punished, economically and otherwise also. That we assure. Both of us (SIT chief Justice Shah) are too well known for doing it to discomfort of many people," vice chairman Justice Arijit Pasayat said.
The SIT was asked to complete the probe by next March.
What is black money
Black money arises mainly from incomes not disclosed to the government usually to avoid taxation, and, sometimes, because of its criminal links
Size of India's black economy
In 2011, the government had commissioned a joint study by three think-tanks - NIPFP, NIFM and NCAER - to estimate Indian entities' unaccounted wealth both at home and abroad. The final report has not been submitted.
India ranked fifth largest exporter of illicit money between 2002-2011, with a total of $343.04 billion, and in 2011 it was placed third when $84.93 billion was sent abroad, according to a 2013 report titled 'Illicit Financial Flows from Developing Countries: 2002-2011'
According to Global Financial Integrity (GFI), a Washington-based think-tank, Indians salted away $462 billion (about Rs. 28 lakh crore in current exchange rates) in overseas tax havens between 1948-2008.

Maharashtra: Uddhav Thackeray may not attend swearing-inComments
Devendra Fadnavis, 44, will take oath as the 27th chief minister of Maharashtra and the first Bharatiya Janata Party’s CM in the state at a grand function at Wankhede Stadium on Friday.

The function could be boycotted by the BJP’s estranged ally Shiv Sena which is unhappy over not getting a desired deal to participate in the BJP-led government.
Uncertainty loomed in the Sena camp through Thursday as senior leaders indicated that Thackeray and Sena legislators were unlikely to attend the ceremony.
The party was hoping a solution would emerge after a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP president Amit Shah and Fadnavis in Delhi on Thursday but no such indication was given by the BJP.
Fadnavis is likely to take oath of office in presence of PM Modi, chief ministers of several BJP ruled states, party chief Shah and a large number of celebrities.
Senior BJP leader Rajiv Pratap Rudy said a small team will take oath with Fadnavis and the expansion of the council of ministers would be conducted later. 
“It is unlikely that other party ministers will be sworn in tomorrow. But there is a possibility that it will be our partner in the future,” Rudy said on Thursday, making it  clear that no Sena legislator would be taking oath on Friday.
Reacting to Rudy’s statement, Sena leaders said they would not attend the ceremony. “Our MLAs have expressed that they should be treated with respect if the BJP wants them to be part of the government. If that is not happening then no one from the Sena will attend the ceremony, not even Uddhavji,” said Sena MP Vinayak Raut.
"As our MLAs feel that BJP did not give us due respect, why should we attend the oath-taking ceremony?" Sena MP Vinayak Raut told reporters after meeting party president Uddhav Thackeray.
Sources said the Sena leadership may prefer to wait for few more days as BJP would have to take a decision before the assembly session is held in November to prove majority of the new government.
Meanwhile, the BJP is also grappling with the problem of finalising names of ministers and also the allocation of portfolios. Sources said the issue was discussed in the meeting between Modi, Shah and Fadnavis.

Company Finds Out The Hard Way It s Illegal To Pay $1.21 An Hour In Americareddit
This takes egregiously low wages to a whole new level.
A Silicon Valley company that digitizes images said Thursday that an "administrative error" led to it paying eight workers flown in from Bangalore, India just $1.21 an hour to work 120-hour weeks installing computers in the company's headquarters.
Electronics For Imaging paid the workers $40,000 in back wages and overtime and a $3,500 fine after the U.S. Department of Labor investigated the payroll violation based on an anonymous tip, a department official told The Huffington Post.
"These folks were not only not getting time-and-a-half when working extremely long hours, they weren't making the basic minimum wage," Michael Eastwood, assistant district director for the Labor Department's San Francisco division said.
In a statement, the company said it didn't realize it was illegal to pay workers temporarily in the United States the same wages they earn in their home countries. The $1.21 was equivalent to what the employees made in Indian rupees.
“We unintentionally overlooked laws that require even foreign employees to be paid based on local U.S. standards,” the company said in a statement.
Eastwood said the company also failed to keep documentation of the hours worked by the Indian employees. Though the workers were only owed $20,000 in back pay and overtime, regulators doubled that amount to $40,000 in the settlement to compensate for damages.
The company blamed an “administrative error” and said it took steps to ensure it would not occur again.
David Lindsay, a spokesman for the company, told HuffPost the labor violation occurred last year, and that the back wages, overtime and fine had already been paid. Eastwood confirmed that all dues were paid in August.
Electronics For Imaging earned a total net income of $109.11 million last year, up from $83.27 million in 2012. The stock price has climbed steadily over the last five years:
Wage theft is nothing new in the Silicon Valley region. Last year, Bloom Energy Corporation was forced to pay out nearly $64,000 in back pay and damages to 14 workers from Mexico who were paid just $2.66 an hour.
"Unfortunately, we do see a high level of wage theft violations," Eastwood said. "But we want to send a clear message that the Department of Labor is here and we are vigorously enforcing the Fair Labor Standards Act ."

Change in Our Justice System Is Long Overdue; Pass Prop 47!reddit
The right to vote is central to any movement for social change.
In the 1960's, voter registration drives were a central strategy to the civil rights movement and today voting continues to play a pivotal role in our democracy.
As someone who cares deeply about education, I felt compelled to make this video increase voter participation and raise awareness of the need to stop the growing school-to-prison pipeline.
In the last three decades, prison spending has grown exponentially faster than spending on education. In fact, in California alone, we have built 22 prisons and only 1 UC University since 1980.
Today, we incarcerate five times more prisoners than 1980 and prison spending has increased by 1500 percent. The devastating impact of this dramatic growth has not been felt evenly - African Americans are seven times more likely than whites to be incarcerated and Latinos are twice as likely.
America's incarceration addiction has torn apart communities, disenfranchised millions of people -- most for nonviolent offenses -- and denied countless individuals an opportunity to gain employment, housing and even some of their most basic human rights. And it hasn't made us any safer -- more that 6 out of 10 prisoners return to prison after release while communities struggle with run down schools and inadequate resources.
Change in our justice system is long overdue. That's why I'm advocating so strongly for the passage of Proposition 47, a groundbreaking sentencing reform initiative in California that will begin to reverse decades of over-incarceration and reallocate prison spending to schools, prevention and treatment.
Prop. 47 will change six low-level nonviolent drug possession and petty theft crimes from felonies to misdemeanors, and invest the prison cost savings -- in the millions of dollars -- into K-12 schools, mental health treatment and victim services.
It's supported by law enforcement, crime victims and teachers, along with a diverse coalition of business leaders, civil rights organizations, community groups, faith leaders, artists and many more.
And it will pass if each and every one of us decides to exercise our basic right to vote.
I urge you to tell your neighbors, co-workers, family members and friends about the critical importance of voting Yes on Prop. 47.
This election -- less than two weeks away -- will make history not only in California, but also in the rest of the country.
Now is the time to act. Now is the time to vote Yes on Prop. 47.

Steve Ballmer Could Score $1 Billion Tax Break For Buying The Clippersreddit
Steve Ballmer could score a $1 billion tax break from his purchase of the Los Angeles Clippers, according to an analysis by the Financial Times.
The former Microsoft CEO shelled out $2 billion to buy the NBA franchise in May, following the ouster of owner Donald Sterling. But Ballmer can use a little-known tax deduction called "goodwill" to claim roughly $1 billion over the next 15 years, according to FT.
Ballmer -- and the markets at large -- are bullish on sports franchises as the value of media rights for college and professional sports teams skyrocket. Ballmer has reason to believe the Clippers are a wise investment, even though he paid four times more than anyone ever has for an NBA team.
"Do I think my investment in the Clippers will be as good as an investment, total return, as an S&P investment fund? I believe it will be, and I believe it has less downside," Ballmer told Charlie Rose last week. "If you compare it to tech stocks, it's got real earnings."
The FT explains that "goodwill" is "commonly used by tax specialists to structure deals for sports teams." Using a conservative estimate, the outlet finds that Ballmer could be looking at $1 billion in tax savings .
While Ballmer may get a break on his purchase, critics have called out other professional sports leagues for their use of tax breaks to build costly stadiums with public money. Leagues like the NFL and NHL are registered as nonprofit, tax-exempt organizations, and they receive millions in public subsidies.
The NBA, in contrast, is not tax-exempt, but the league did just finalize a record-breaking TV deal with Walt Disney and Time Warner worth $24 billion. And some leading players are reportedly pushing to remove maximum salary contracts to better reflect their value to the franchises.
"I don't see how the owners can say they're losing money now," Kevin Durrant, the league's MVP, told reporters.
But judging by Ballmer's recent Clippers' pep rally, he's excited about a lot more than just a good tax deal:
CORRECTION: A previous version of this article called the potential tax savings a "credit." It is a deduction.

All Your Favorite Halloween Candy Is Made By Only 10 Corporationsreddit
Arguably the best part of trick-or-treating as a kid was when you got home, dumped your take on the floor and evaluated the night's haul. Maybe you sorted it by which type was your favorite -- Hershey's over here, Reese's over there, sad, unwanted lollipops and Now and Laters thrown in the discard pile. Maybe you did it by color if you were an artistic type, or by flavor profile if you were a blossoming foodie.
Most kids probably don't sort their Halloween candy according to which company owns the brand, because most kids don't know or care where their treats come from. But if they, or an adult who cares a lot about candy conglomerates, were to do so, here's what it would look like:
Who knew Smarties and Tootsie Rolls had their own companies?
Unsurprisingly, American chocolate giants Hershey and Mars distribute much of the chocolate sold in the U.S. (and chocolate is America's favorite Halloween treat, according to a 2013 survey by the National Confectioners Association):
Note: The Huffington Post defined "Halloween candy" by going to Manhattan locations of CVS, Duane Reade and Walgreens and seeing what was being sold in the Halloween aisle. This is most likely not a comprehensive list of everything everyone considers "Halloween candy."

Tim Cook Calls Out His Home StateTim Cook Calls Out His Home State Over Lack Of LGBT Rights
 | By JAY REEVES
reddit
MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — Alabama was too slow to guarantee the rights of minorities during the civil rights era, and now it's too slow to ensure the rights of people based on sexual orientation and gender identity, Apple CEO Tim Cook said Monday in challenging his home state to do better.
Cook's comments came as he, University of Alabama football coach Nick Saban and six others were inducted into the Alabama Academy of Honor, which recognizes living state natives for their contributions.
Speaking at the Capitol in the chamber where the state voted to secede from the Union in 1861, Cook said Alabama and the nation "have a long way to go" before realizing Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream of equality.
Alabama was "too slow" to guarantee rights in the 1960s, Cook said, and it removed a ban on interracial marriage from its Constitution only 14 years ago.
"And (Alabama is) still too slow on equality for the LGBT community. Under the law, citizens of Alabama can still be fired based on their sexual orientation," said Cook, a native of coastal Baldwin County. "We can't change the past, but we can learn from it and we can create a different future."
Alabama is among the states that do not recognize same-sex marriage, and it also doesn't offer legal protections on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.
Cook also called educational equality "one of the greatest civil rights issues of our times." Earlier this year, Apple said it would give $100 million for school technology, and Cook announced the money would go for equipment and training at 114 schools in more than 29 states, including five in Alabama.
"We at Apple view it our responsibility to step up and act," Cook said. The company is partnering with the White House on the project.
Cook is a native of Robertsdale who attended Auburn University. He succeeded Apple founder Steve Jobs as chief executive officer in 2011.
Other honorees included University of Alabama President Judy Bonner; Big Oak Ranch founder John Croyle; biotech leader Jim Hudson Jr. of Huntsville; U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions; former Mountain Brook mayor Margaret Porter; and businessman Edgar Welden.
The Apple executive spoke on behalf of the group. He visited a Baptist church once pastored by King before the ceremony.

David Gregory Heading To Yahoo For Midterms  But Keeping Options OpenDavid Gregory Appearing On Yahoo For Midterms, Keeping Options Open
Posted:
reddit
NEW YORK -– Former "Meet the Press" host David Gregory is "really looking forward" to taking part in Yahoo’s midterm election coverage next Tuesday, he told The Huffington Post in a phone interview.
Gregory will appear on the online political special with his friend and former NBC News colleague Katie Couric, who now serves as Yahoo’s global anchor. The Yahoo appearance, first reported by The New York Times, is likely to trigger speculation about Gregory’s future career plans.
Gregory does not have a commitment to Yahoo beyond election night at this time and told HuffPost "my options are pretty open right now."
"It’s just an interesting time for me to be exploring," he said. "That’s what I’m doing."
In August, Chuck Todd replaced Gregory as host of "Meet the Press" following long-running speculation as the show's ratings declined that Gregory was on his way out. He left the network the same day.
Gregory, who spent two decades at NBC News, seems open to opportunities beyond broadcast television, noting that there's "a lot of exciting stuff being done in the digital space."
Outside the news business, Gregory is currently writing a book on journeys of faith, including his own experience with Judaism.

Mark your calendars: November is designated as National Entrepreneurship Month (NEM), a time to celebrate the men and women who have the courage to take smart risks in business, enriching and innovating our lives with the results of their efforts.
This month, there are tons of events and holidays that focus on honoring entrepreneurs and innovators as well as increasing youth interest in entrepreneurship. Global Entrepreneurship Week is recognized from November 17-23. During this event-packed week honoring entrepreneurs all over the world, National Entrepreneurs' Day occurs on Nov. 19, along with Global Women's Entrepreneurship Day. Small Business Saturday falls on Nov. 29.
National Entrepreneurs' Day (NED) was started in 2010 by David Hauser and Siamak Taghaddos (co-founders of the entrepreneur's phone system, Grasshopper) and Amir Tehrani, entrepreneur and co-founder of The Legacy Foundation. This November holiday honors those who promote entrepreneurship, business, innovation, and new jobs in our country as well as promotes entrepreneurship to America's youth, ensuring young entrepreneurs will rise up to replace older generations over time, continuing to innovate our nation long after we are able.
Although it's been presidentially proclaimed each year since 2010, National Entrepreneur's Day is not an official U.S. holiday yet. For more information on the vote to make NED official, you can check out EntrepreneursDay.org.
How will you be celebrating National Entrepreneurship Month? In case you're short on ideas, I came up with 5 things you can do to celebrate this November!
5 Ways to Celebrate NEM
1. Be thankful. If you have an entrepreneur mentor, call and thank them for their guidance and support. It doesn't have to be sappy, just sincere.
2. Be a mentor. If you are an entrepreneur, find an entrepreneur to mentor and offer to share what you've learned along your journey.
3. Be a supporter. Make an effort to support other entrepreneurs by using their services and recommending those you enjoy.
4. Be humble. Be thankful for the lessons you've learned, the success you've tasted, and the challenges you've faced. Appreciate the effects each of these things have had on you as a person and as an entrepreneur. Find peace with that.
5. Be good to yourself. Last but not least, be sure to set aside ample time this month for rest and relaxation or a favorite hobby. Arianna Huffington is a champion of the Thrive movement, urging business owners and employees everywhere to realize the importance of down time.  Rest is critical to your well-being and the long-term success of your efforts, so don't skimp on it as your goals become tangible!

Indigenous ingenuity
Special arrangement The Mahindra Gusto
Special arrangement The Mahindra Gusto instrument cluster
Special arrangement
scooters and motorbikes
The Mahindra Gusto, though good on its own, still lags slightly behind the competition
Mahindra Two-Wheelers’ newest scooter, the Gusto, has been built for Indian and international markets. It has been indigenously developed from the ground up by Mahindra Two-Wheelers R&D division, located on the outskirts of Pune.
The Gusto sports good paint quality, and comes with straight body lines. It’s a somewhat boxy looking scooter, styled conservatively to appeal to a wider audience. Stylish fins placed next to a set of integrated turn signal indicators, lend good relief to the front apron. The smartly-designed headlight provides good visibility at night, and comes supported by a set of LED lamps as well. Switchgear feels premium, is nice to touch and easy to come to terms with. The palm grips could have done with better feel, and likewise, both brake levers don’t feel as good as on every other scooter in India. It does well to include a rear brake locking clamp as standard, an important feature on gearless scooters for improving safety when stationary.
The new scooter comes with large, well placed rear-view mirrors that provide a clear rear view covering an ample field, however, their mounting stems come with flimsy, ill-fitting cladding. The backlit instruments panel displays an easily legible speedometer, odometer and fuel-gauge apart from the other regular warning icons. Just beneath sits a handy storage compartment. Even a taller rider’s knees have enough space to move around freely when turning the handlebar, which is good. Two bag-hooks are in place for quick storage in the foot-well region.
The flip-to-access key gives this Mahindra an up-market feel, and has an inbuilt torch and two extra buttons. The first button operates a jingle and flashes the turn indicators, while the other silently flashes only the indicators to help owners locate their scooter in a crowded or dark parking lot.
A unique and really clever feature is the adjustable seat, which can be adjusted 35mm up or down with minimal effort, a first on an Indian scooter. A stopper built in the hinge to clamp the seat open ensures that it doesn't fall when held open to access the roomy under-seat storage bay.
The Gusto comes with well designed pillion footrests and a flip-down lady footrest. On the other side, a silencer protrudes backwards with its heat shield. The kick-start lever is well designed to ensure easy starts without calling upon undue rider effort. The grab-handle looks smart, as does its large, rear tail-light section. Overall build quality is adequate, although fit-finish as well as rubber and plastics all need improvement.
The new scooter is powered by a four-stroke, 109.6cc, air-cooled, single-cylinder engine with peak power output of 8bhp generated at 7,500rpm, and 0.8kgm of torque coming in at 5,500rpm. Mahindra Two-Wheelers tell us the Gusto uses their M-TEC engine technology, featuring a strengthened crankshaft and bearings, a silent-chain, higher inertia magneto with greater energy ignition coil and an efficient regulator. Once fired up and on the go, the carburetor-fed engine does well to feel butter smooth, and vibe-free throughout its powerband. A distinctive whine does, however, infringe on this otherwise refined sounding engine. Acceleration could also be better – it lacks good enough low and mid-range pep for this class of scooter, calling for riders to open an undue amount of throttle to gain adequate performance. It can power you to respectable speeds, an indicated 80kph being easily achieved on this gearless scooter.
Padding on the Mahindra Gusto saddle feels much too soft, and also fails to allow riders to settle into and sit comfortably. The riding position is good, upright and roomy with the flat floorboard that's comfortable enough as well.
It comes with telescopic suspension in front, but ride quality isn’t as good as expected - the suspension feels too rigid and lacks adequate plush feel. Tyre grip is reasonable; the Gusto gets tubeless rubber as standard. A good turning radius is also a boon on the new scooter; it has a 1,275mm wheelbase. This Mahindra, whilst no segment topper, handles reasonably well, although it feels slightly heavier than rival scooters in city riding conditions.
It is priced at par for its segment, retailing for Rs 43,000-47,000 (ex-showroom, Delhi), positioning the latest Mahindra well in the market, ready to meet it rivals. However, although Mahindra Two-Wheelers is clearly moving in the right direction, with a steadily improving product line-up, the Gusto still comes with more than a fair share of rough edges, all of which need to be smoothened out, before this scooter matches its many rivals already plying Indian streets.

Employers: How Good Employers of Parents Can Become Great Employersreddit
As we celebrate National Work and Family month, I congratulate many enlightened employers who understand most of the demands of working parents. You offer flextime, you offer telecommuting, and you may even afford paid maternity/parental leave. These are wonderful practices that give parents the ability to respond to numerous needs and demands of family.  But -- and yes, there is a "but" -- families need you to understand and truly value the energy and time it takes to grow healthy, responsible, resilient children.  To put it simply, it is not just what you do to support your employed working parents.  It is how you do it.
In the follow-up study (2008) to my dissertation (1994) on employed and at-home mothers that involved 123 mothers over a 14-year period, the strongest emotional pull on employed mothers was their lack of availability to their children. This emotional pull becomes stress when a "crisis" occurs at home and the needed time for family is outside of the current practices most organizations offer employees and/or the agreements about flexibility the employer and employee mutually accept.
Employers who want to move from good to great need to understand and truly value parental efforts that do not fit neatly into clock hours. By appreciating the importance of these efforts, you will be able to support more readily the occasional unplanned family demand that requires parental attention outside of "normal" hours --requests to leave early, take a few hours off, or continue a project at home.
OK, you may be thinking, I understand how this approach helps the employee and the family, but what is in it for me and my company?  Understanding the answer to this question and acting upon it is what moves an employer from good to great.
Negative emotional energy -- being distracted, unfocused, less productive on a job -- occurs when a parent feels s/he needs to attend to an important family matter but cannot because of office demands or practices. If you allow the parent to deal with the unanticipated family concern, the negative emotional energy will not develop.  For example, a mother may have a regular schedule that allows her to leave the office earlier than others so she can be home with her children for dinner.  This is important to her as it allows her to be a highly valued employee and still be very involved with her children daily.
The tradeoff for leaving early, however, is that she has to go back to the office after dinner almost every night to stay current with her work.  And she has a position that is not easily performed from home. Unfortunately, on one of these nights she plans to return to the office after dinner, a child has a meltdown. Whether it is an assignment that is due, materials needed immediately for a project, a reprimand from the coach, or being dissed by a best friend, the child is NOT happy! In fact, the child is miserable.
And mom? She feels terrible and she feels torn. She wants her child to feel better. She wants her child to have a plan to handle the situation. She wants her child to feel competent and have self-esteem restored. She wants all these things addressed and to be part of addressing them as an involved and loving mother.
Yet she also feels stress from the employment side. She knows she has work to do at the office. In fact, she is expected back soon -- time is limited.  She has this "special deal" with the employer that allows her to leave early and return to work later.  She does not want to abuse or even look like she is abusing that deal by not going back to work.
What are her options? Leave it all to dad, knowing he is (or is not) excellent about handling these situations and return to the office?  Know that dad can handle it -- will certainly try -- but like Anne-Marie Slaughter in her Atlantic Monthly article (June, 2014) "Why Women Still Can't Have It All" feels that her presence is needed and not return to work? Talk quickly with dad about tactics to be utilized and leave? Listen and then discuss quickly with child promising a more thorough discussion later? Or, let the child know she's loved, can handle the situation and just leave?
One result is a given. When that mother returns to the office, if she does, she is not the same employee she was when she left. She will not have the energy and focus she normally has when she returns after dinner.  Dealing with the child's meltdown is still top of mind.
Employers: What if she had the opportunity NOT to come back to the office that night? What if you valued and understood that she address the "crisis" at home? What if you thought it was important that she takes care of matters at home before returning to the work at hand and had communicated that to her, so she was not feeling guilty about focusing on the child's issue rather than returning to work? What if you totally trusted that she would complete the project on her own time... maybe much of it late that evening after all had settled down? Can you imagine the support and reduction of stress your employee would feel? And the enhanced gratitude toward you, the employer, for allowing her to maintain the working/parenting balance?
Try this more expansive understanding of parenting in honor of families in National Work and Family Month.  You'll like it.  And so will your employees.

Inside the Shark Tankreddit
When I walked on to the stage of ABC's Shark Tank , and saw my belts hanging there on the rack, I felt a calmness that can only be described as, a peaceful realization of possible futures. I had made many turns and many detours through my life to arrive at this moment. There are pivotal moments that shape us, but the truth is all decisions matter. We find ourselves in the moment and what we decide changes the possible future.
The past leads you to a moment, your present, your reality. I like to think about a championship game or a world series. We all wish to be the person on the plate, the quintessential difference maker. However, before we can be that person who makes the meaningful and all-important home run, we must make the team in the first place. Naturally people want to be part of the results, not so much the process. Its easy to look on and dream of being that person, it's much harder to do it.
The most common question people have for me regarding Shark Tank, "Were you nervous?" I joke that I'm too dumb to be nervous, but the reality is I wasn't nervous because the moments and experiences that led me there had prepared me to hit. I had nothing to fear, I knew the game and was prepared to play.
I think when many of us watch the show, we see people that are not ready to play, they don't know their numbers or in some cases what to do next. No potential investor wants to hear that you don't have a plan. The pitfalls of dreaming are the failures of planning to make the dreams a reality.
A good idea will get you nowhere.  There are no million-dollar ideas, only million-dollar executions in some cases like Mission Belt Co., it's a multimillion dollar execution, or multi-billion dollar execution if you look at FUBU, Daymond John's dream that he created out of a few hundred bucks and some raw hustle.
Here are a few things you can do to be ready for the big game:
1. Create a playbook.
The NFL and the military use them to coordinate offense and defense. Businesses use a business plan which is part of the plan, but you need to go deeper if you want to get that business plan in front of the right investor and get them to work with you.
I wrote Daymond's name on a cue card and put it in my pocket before I walked out on stage. I knew what I wanted, why and I also knew what I would ask for.
2. Check yourself before you wreck yourself.
Reality check time. Make sure that you go to the table and get what you want, but you better make sure there's some excellent math involved to entice your would be investor to partner with you. All too often we see greedy little pigs go in front of the sharks and ask for the the sun and the moon and have little to offer in the way of results and often times little in the way of equity/reward.
3. Showing up is half the battle.
The best pitches are backed by results, I had only been in business a few months when I had met Daymond, but I had hustled $39,000 of Mission Belts to people, mostly out of the trunk of my car. Those kinds of efforts do not go unnoticed by an investor, as much as your idea, investors buy you.
Theres a cliché that has become commonplace, "good things come to those that wait." This is not only not true, it's the opposite of the truth, if it were a compass and you wished to go north, that advice would take you south. It's a marketing tactic created my master salesmen, like myself, to trick you into buying ketchup out of an antiquated glass bottle.
From my ten commandments of selling: "1. Thou shalt hustle." There is a reason it's the first commandment, it's the most important. Show up and your potential investor may just bet on you!

Pensions: Strengthening Our Workplaces  Communities and the Middle Classreddit
Job loyalty.  It seems like a concept that is slipping quietly into the night.
Over the past several decades, we have seen a number of alarming private-sector workplace trends that have diminished the relationship between employer and employee.  The rise of contractors and temp employees, outsourcing, and diminished benefits have all led to an "every man for himself" attitude in today's workforce.
But perhaps the biggest contributor to job loyalty's demise is the death of the private-sector pension.  It's a lesson that should give policymakers pause in the heated debate over public pension benefits.
Over the past two decades, the proportion of private-sector workers in America covered by traditional defined benefit pensions, which provide a fixed amount for the duration of a retiree's life, has dropped by roughly half -- 35 percent to 18 percent.  Workers with a company pension have every incentive to grow their skills within the company, seek opportunities internally, and dedicate a lifetime of service to their organization.
Robbing workers of a pension diminishes their sense of commitment. That leads to a number of problems -- turnover, breaks in service to customers, and diminished productivity.
By 2008, the public sector had become the last place a significant proportion of workers earned a traditional pension.  But when the Great Recession struck, pension investment earnings dropped, and it became clear that politicians had spent years underfunding many state and municipal pension systems.
This financial malfeasance has given pension opponents ammunition to go after public sector pensions.  That may not seem like a problem for the average Joe, but eliminating public sector pensions isn't just a workplace squabble between employee and employer.  Eliminating public pensions has consequences for every citizen.
A new report released this month by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College sheds some light on these consequences. The study found that workers who left public service in cities with poor pension plans made more money in the private sector than their replacements made in their old jobs. In these cases, worker quality - measured by private-sector wage, in this study -- decreased as a result of pension cuts. Meanwhile, cities that have better pensions have a smaller "gap" in the quality of the workers leaving public service.
Public employees work for all of us.  They teach our children.  They clean our streets.  If you have a car accident, it's a public employee who arrives at the scene.  If your house catches fire, you call a public employee to put it out. More than half of non-federal public jobs are in public safety and education.  These are jobs that naturally lend themselves to career longevity.  Imagine the disaster that would ensue if a local fire department all of a sudden had to replace seasoned firefighters with temp workers.  What would your kid's school look like if a principal replaced all your teachers with private contractors?
Real-world examples bear out the findings of the Boston College report.  San Diego made drastic changes to its pension system in 2012, and lost 162 police officers over the course of the 2014 fiscal year .  A lot of experience walked out the door.  Today, half of the patrol officers have been with the San Diego Police department six years or less.  Brian Marvel, president of the San Diego Police Officers Association, estimates that it takes five years for a police officer to become competent at the job.
San Jose also lost more than 400 police officers in recent years after the controversial Measure B gutted employee benefits.  The courts later ruled Measure B unconstitutional, but sadly for the people of San Jose, the damage is already done.
It's not just public safety that suffers. There are also unforeseen consequences on your tax bill.
Public sector jobs require a tremendous amount of upfront training at taxpayer cost.  In San Diego, for example, the police force spends $191,000 for each first year recruit, including a 6-month training camp.  Pensions are a form of deferred compensation that help retain these recruits and justify the initial expense.
Further, benefits that reward long tenure help convince workers to take state jobs that generally pay 11% less than similar private sector jobs.  Taking away pension plans would force state and municipalities to raise wages just to remain competitive.
The negative consequences resulting from the end of private-sector pensions would be far worse in the public sector.  It's not just a matter of retirement security for public workers - it's a matter of security for all of us.
States and municipalities would do well to remember that when considering their budget priorities.

On the Wild Side: South African Retailreddit
There's a word for South African (SA) retail: wild (which can be both positive and negative, as I'll reveal later in this article). It's unlike anything we see in mature Western markets like the US, UK, and Australia, which seem relatively staid and tame by comparison. On a recent trip to the southern tip of the African continent, I learned that SA retail marches to the beat of its own drum with a sense of energy, an edge, and a remarkable diversity.
The sweep of retail starts with the "spaza shops" , which are convenience stores at the heart of the community in SA townships. Often set up in private houses, I discovered that "spaza" was originally a slang term for "camouflaged". So these are literally "secret stores", designed to be visible to locals but to fly just slightly below the radar of the authorities.
There are many other forms of "unorganized" retail in SA. Enterprising merchants pop up at traffic lights cheerily trying to flog drivers impulse buys such as toy helicopters. Around major transport hubs such as the central Park Station in Johannesburg, stallholders hover with fake Levis, baseball caps and Converse shoes. They're all just trying to make a buck in a country with 25% official unemployment.
Sellers often purchase their goods from cash and carry warehouse stores such as Super Jumbo, where the range of product runs from fireworks to fruit-infused shampoos. At one of these stores, I saw a massive banner near the cash register with an image of Nelson Mandela and the line: "TATA you will always be remembered".
There's also refined retail in SA. I found two of the most creative and stylishly executed craft markets I've seen anywhere - the Old Biscuit Mill and the Water Shed , both in Cape Town. Most ingenious product sold at the Water Shed? Used teabags "repurposed with hope". Most quirky? Electric guitars fashioned out of old oil-cans (which actually had an incredible tone). Most desirable? Fashion bags stitched in townships out of scraps of cloth. (SA has a heritage of refashioning discarded items and brands into something useful, or just beautiful.)
Around the Old Biscuit Mill markets, I witnessed leading edge technology in use. A stallholder completed a credit card transaction with an " iKhokha " dongle plugged into his mobile phone. ("Khokha" is Zulu for "pay".)  Nearby, a glamorous furniture store armed its patrons with iPads which, when you scanned the price tickets, gave you information on each product. South Africans - like much of Africa - are tech savvy and mobile-enabled. At Park Station, I saw a billboard for the " M-Pesa " platform, which allows people to transfer money easily via their phones, in a way that you still can't in the US.
SA also has its fair share of world-class "regular retail" too. Above the Pick 'n Pay* on Nicol supermarket in Johannesburg sits a huge and gleaming "Good Food Studio", where customers and corporates alike can learn about the finer aspects of wine and food, or sample sweet treats in the "Chocolate Room".
At the Waterstone Village Centre in Cape Town is a Woolworths store, which was voted "Best Supermarket in the World 2014" (according to The Association of Retail Environments Awards).  I was taken there by author and retail commentator Martin Butler , and we both observed that the store checked many of the boxes for supermarket retail today - in terms of display, brand language, sustainability and services.
Less than 24 hours after I was there however, a security guard was shot dead in the same shopping center.
And that's the truly wild side of SA retail (and society there generally). The disparity between the haves and have-nots is so great that it can result in theft and violence.  Mall car parks have security entrances, and you pay a small amount to have your vehicle watched. Returning home with your purchases, you are likely to bunker down behind razor wire and security systems. (Many locals will tell you that it's not that bad, but to me at least SA felt more dangerous than the US, which in turn seems less safe than my home country, Australia.)
It hasn't stopped the entry of the big international players such as Zara and Topshop though. SA retail is globalizing along with the rest of the world.
The mix of first world and third world environments makes SA one of the most interesting markets I have ever visited for retail. Yes, there's a tension between opposing ends of the retail spectrum, but it's never, ever dull. Perhaps that's why sales are rising at 8.8% p.a. As the best retailers know, you can't bore people into buying.
*Pick 'n Pay is a client of Y&R Advertising, the parent company of Labstore, which Jon Bird heads up.

The Best Advice for Small Business Success: Part 1reddit
Whether solicited or not, you've probably received some sort of advice from any number of people, including friends, family, colleagues and teachers. But what's the most powerful advice you've ever received? What exactly made it so memorable? How did it help you? We reached out to small business owners in Manta's community to find out what they consider to be the best advice they ever received, how it resonated with them and why it was so meaningful.
We spoke to Louis Gibson, owner of The Gibson Entertainment Firm, a full-service entertainment firm that provides tools and resources, including marketing, legal guidance and professional exposure, to help clients gain traction in the music industry. To this day, Gibson remembers a drill instructor telling him, "Lack of education in any business will cause an individual to jump over dollars to pick up pennies. Education is a priceless asset in any business."
Whether a lawyer or a mechanic, having the right education and training plays a key role in how successful your small business will be. For any professional, it's important to educate yourself beyond your industry expertise and focus your efforts on running a business. We dove into Gibson's advice to learn more about the impact it's had on his life.
Manta: Who gave you this piece of advice?
Louis Gibson: I received this advice from a drill instructor when I was in the U.S. Marine Corps. He used to say it while we were going through training.
Manta: How did it make you feel when you first heard it?
LG: I knew that my drill instructor was talking long term, and that he wanted me to apply the advice to being the best member of the Marine Corps I could be. But what he was really doing was preparing me for the future by teaching me how to think of the big picture. He gave that advice to me throughout my time in the Marine Corps, repeating it often. It not only motivated me to educate myself, but it gave me an understanding that it's not always about instant gratification. If I was going to be successful in whatever I chose to do, which ended up being a business owner, I needed to develop a business plan and educate myself about the ins and outs of running a business. It wasn't going to happen overnight, nor was it going to be easy.
Manta: Why do you consider this the best advice you've ever received? When did it begin to really resonate with you?
LG: It resonated when I started to think about my future after the Marine Corps and what it would look like if I started my own business. Before beginning, I reached out to other business owners to understand challenges they faced along the way. I turned to sites like Manta for tips on running a small business; I did everything I could to learn as much as possible before launching my business. When you educate yourself, you learn how to get back up when you fall down. Making mistakes is okay, but you have to learn from them.
Manta: How do you use education as a tool in your business today?
LG: We educate our clients in everything that we do, from instructing them on how to create their own independent label to providing them a thorough understanding of the legal end. A lot of our clients don't have any knowledge of the business aspect of entertainment, and so they forget to focus on the tools they need for success. I teach people how to form a business and tailor their lifestyle to reflect their goals.
Gibson's advice speaks to every kind of small business. No matter what you do, or where you're at in your career, it's important to seek training and educate yourself to bring your business to the next level. Take a class at a local college, attend a workshop or a read a how-to book to help broaden your skill set. And be sure to tap into your network by asking other business owners who have been there before. Yes, it can be difficult to invest the time and energy into training and education, but it's all about the long run. Believe me, your business will thank you.

I Never Got An MBA ... I Had Sex Insteadreddit
This is the unabashed truth. A boy named J was my first love.
I honestly believe I loved him more than he loved me. And that's probably why he left me. But not before he cheated.
It's a story from the past that still has relevance because if it wasn't for J taking my virginity I wouldn't be the business owner I am today.
Not because it was good. It was like anyone's first time.
The pain totally exceeds the pleasure, but you bury that sensation way down because deep inside your heart you believe a person who loves you back is showing you just how much in a beautiful physical expression.
Sorry, but not so much the case. J took my most precious possession, but I willingly gave it up to him. To me it was everything.
But the next day he scoffed about it. I knew then that it didn't mean as much to him, but for the next few months, I lied to myself.
Willing myself to believe that he loved me just as much as I loved him.
Then one day he left. It didn't take long, after he was gone, for me to find out about the girl he cheated on me with. She was a friend of mine.
To make matters even worse, he came back a few months later, and I let him back into my life. As a friend with benefits.
I tried to use sex as a leveraging tool to keep him this time. But he left again. And my world actually came crumbling down that day.
I was broken for a long time. But something kept stirring inside of me, even while I was broken.
Something that I had been burying for years. Back from the days when my stepmother verbally beat me down. A desire to stand up for myself finally.
Because I was sick and tired of people using me up and throwing me out. Losing my virginity and allowing myself to be mistreated like that was the last straw.
I needed to do something for the desperate girl inside of me who's voice was constantly being stifled.
By the verbal abuse growing up. By the church who constantly wanted to fix me. By the boy named J who didn't appreciate the girl who loved him more.
It didn't come right away, but it did come. And it started by me learning to love myself. All of me.
I had to wash away those bad words my stepmother threw over me growing up by writing down good words about myself everyday. It's still one of the hardest things I've had to do.
I had to find my own path. Away from the church, away from rules and restrictions and confinements. I had to learn what love really was.
Some of my searching took me down really risky paths with the wrong men, but I'm thankful still. Because it's how I learned boundaries on my own terms.
I had to learn how to love myself from the ground up.
Because one of the most difficult truths for me to accept, the girl who always got everything right, was that I didn't actually love myself. Let alone like myself.
I had to lock myself away and actually reintroduce myself to the vibrant girl I used to be before my mom died. The girl I buried away when I was six.
I took myself on dates. I started to write again. I read a lot. I met new friends who accepted this whole version of me, bruises and all.
Then something funny happened. I woke up one day and realized that I was unabashedly in love with a girl. The one staring back at me in the mirror. And it wasn't selfish.
Finally I understood and forgave J. He didn't know how much he hurt me when he took my virginity. He couldn't. He didn't love himself, like I didn't love myself.
We were no more than two broken pieces coming together for an extended one-night stand.
I had to hit rock bottom like that to actually heal myself from the ground up. And the only way I could ever be a voice for others is if I took ownership of my own life first.
I've learned that it's not selfish to be there for you first, because it's the only way you can be there fully for others. It's the only way you can love others. It starts with you.
So I got into coaching for this very reason. To be that bridge for people just like me, stuck between who they think they should be and who they actually are.
You don't have to hit rock bottom to get there but, if you do, it doesn't hurt that bad.
I don't take anyone's crap these days. I'm there for the people who need me. I know what my boundaries are. I've learned how to take ownership in my life and business.
If I didn't go through the lows, I wouldn't have ever taken the time to unlearn the mistruths spoken over me.
I wouldn't have quit my job and founded my own business. I wouldn't be in a healthy relationship with someone whole who loves the whole version of me equally back.
I wouldn't have believed then that I could. And I wouldn't be teaching others how to do the same thing for themselves now.
It's all intertwined at the end of the day. My love, my life, my business. It all stems from a whole version of me.
And for that reason, I'm thankful that losing my virginity taught me how to be the business owner I am today.

Fear Of Falling: Getting Older And What That Means For Taking Risksreddit
My roommate's night out and her exhibiting the beginnings of a cold were the perfect storm that woke me abruptly at 3:30 AM. Luckily, it's been one of those mornings where my brain took off for morning before the light could catch up, anyhow. So, forgive me for any overly sentimental or lyrical words. There's some irrational sense of protection that comes with darkness that makes a person a bit more sensitive.
I love Brooklyn at this time. It's sleepy in a way that the city never was. And the people up before the sun are a different breed, emitting energy that I'm pretty sure must power the sun.
And I love this time of year. My body feels a very visceral change from Summer to Fall, an ease as my limbs relax into cozy fabrics and my morning coffee is hot and perfect. I like being warmed from the inside out, rather than Summer's tendency for the other way around.
I've long tried to explain my love of Fall. It could be said that it's because I was born then (I turned an impossible 31 last week). But it goes far beyond that, I think. Fall is an in-between. An odd mash up of boots and bare arms. A bridge that links two extremes, finding some comfortable balance between the two. Call me trite and all-too-literally a Libra, but I like the balance -- that somewhere in between.
I think that's why I don't miss my 20s and am settling into my 30s quite nicely. I used to feel like I was waiting for my life to start, but now I know: this is it. No light at the end of the tunnel, the whole damn thing's illuminated. And while I still think it's completely bizarre, this whole getting older thing, I respect the changes, and I'm grateful that I see aging as a sort of experiment.
A while ago, I was on a date and in the middle of my talking about something, The Charmer looked at me like I was a science fair project. In a condescending tone, as if I was using the wrong words, he said, "You seem to think a lot of things are 'interesting' and 'amazing.'" He formed his mouth around the letters like they tasted bad... My response came after a moment of silence and thought. I sifted through my rolodex of vocab words, wondering if he was right, but soon answered, "Yup. I do... And, I won't apologize."
That said, while I am in awe and do feel more balanced, the older I get the more risky the decisions I have to make. "Failure" has a harsher connotation. I've never been one to throw caution to the wind, but I am a firm believer in calculated risks and vast leaps of faith. Being the co-founder of a newly launched startup is a jump that's proving fairly hard to get my feet off the ground (and I mean that in many senses). It's not for lack of trying, or passion, or motivation. But starting a business is difficult. However, I do believe in our passion-powered ability. And we've got some awesome things happening. So while it's at a speed that requires patience, I do trust that we'll keep making progress.
And then there's my creative life. As an actor that's currently on hiatus, I'm feeling the need to perform maybe more than ever before. The fire in my chest when I think about jumping into a script is so hot that I swear you could feel it if you put your hand to my heart. And while I do continue to audition a fair amount for commercial gigs, I have to trust that I will get back to the Art of it sometime very soon. And, in the meantime, I pour my creative self into projects at hand.
Then... there's my personal situation. A person I previously solidified as a fairly intense memory came back to my material present. Allowing all of the previous stuff that I buried over a year ago to surface and re-appear raw is not easy. Trusting and letting go, while knowing all too well the consequences that could come, takes a lot. But with the release of my ego, I choose not to dwell in the past. And I've made the adult decision that I'd way rather risk the possibility of an unfavorable future than miss the reward of right now.
...So while I don't throw caution to that ever present wind, there is a certain amount of sway. After all, the ubiquitous "they" always say that the leaps you don't take are the ones that hurt the most.
So I'm just staying open. Trusting in transitions. Not glued to any one outcome. And, whether I'm ready or not, looks like life is headed this way -- my best friend just moved out of NYC. I'm getting texts with pictures of positive pregnancy sticks (and we're happy about it). Friends' parents are passing away. People ask to see my neck when they find out how old I am. And I'm finding it harder and harder to dress myself fashionably... It comes...
And the truth is, I'm kinda scared shitless. But worry never changed an outcome. And while fear is a main character in life (as is failure), it informed the plot much more when I was young and it made decisions for me. Like when I was 15 and learning to drive -- I only made right turns, because left meant leaving the safety of the neighborhood.
Things do change.
So, it seems even this season's name itself shares a connotation with some of my intrinsic traits. Fall. Be pulled by the rules of nature. Gravity the leader. Submitting to the whim of things inescapable. Between events. Between moments. Between people. Somewhere along the way I learned that left turns were inevitable. And while I'm usually sure to look in both directions first, here I zig zag. Thinking it's all 'interesting' and 'amazing,' raising my hands and laughing while I lose my stomach on the ride.

In Light of the Loss of Orbital Sciences  Antaresreddit
In the aftermath of the recent loss of Orbital Sciences Antares, some have criticized NASA's reliance on commercial providers, and specifically Orbital Sciences. This is a subject matter upon which I have a unique understanding and perspective. I am the first second-generation astronaut, an investor in many commercial spaceflight companies and have served on the NASA advisory council. While my opinions are clearly my own and neither that of the commercial industry nor NASA, they are informed by growing up as part of the NASA family, and having a foot planted firmly on both sides of the government and commercial sides of this discussion.
It is important to understand the broad context for why it seems to be hard to make inexpensive or reliable rockets. Unlike cars and planes which have high flight rates, the lifetime launches of a particular rocket system is low. And the lifetime of an individual rocket is usually one launch. Thus there are few opportunities to expose and work out the flaws in the general system design, much less in the manufacture of an individual rocket. While rocket components are tested individually and again once assembled, there is no stress quite like the actual launch itself to ultimately see if it's all working fully.
Interestingly in Russia, the Soyuz Spacecraft in which I flew, has a 35-year perfect safety track record. One of the main ways in which this has been accomplished is that the Russians have iterated since their first launch vehicle for Sputnik, through Vostok that took Gagarin into space, and every subsequent model of Soyuz including the one I flew on. While the system has slowly gained capabilities, it has also grown to be safer and safer. The only fatalities aboard Soyuz were in its earliest days. Contrast in the USA. We first launched people aboard an ICBM for Mercury, then a new vehicle for Gemini, another unrelated vehicle for Apollo, then the "design by congressional committee" Space Shuttle, which was the least safe and most costly of all. Now we are starting over yet again. New designs, with no flight rate history. Thus starting over again from a safety standpoint.
As for the loss of the Orbital Sciences vehicle specifically. Orbital has a quality team, doing their very best, and I am sure they and their launch systems will get better with launch cycles, as is true for each launch system and team. I am personally invested in teams that had hardware lost on that launch, and those teams will surely struggle due to this loss. Yet, for our nation and for NASA, this move to commercial operations is essential, and will ultimately provide far greater safety, more frequent access and cheaper access, than was possible before -- likely by cost and safety margins of 10X or better!
What will ultimately get us out of this vicious circle of low flight rates for rocket technology will be true full reusability. This is what Space X is championing and making great progress towards. They have already landed their first stage twice (in the ocean) and their Dragon Capsule will soon be able to use its combination powered abort and landing system. Even if they too have some failures along the way, this is key to bringing down costs and increasing safety through flight rates. The British are working on a vehicle called Skylon, which if/when finished could fulfill this requirement. Also my wife's company Escape Dynamics, is building a Single Stage to Orbit Space Plane, powered via external electromagnetic energy. In time, these fully reusable, high flight rate systems, will win in the cost and safety race.
Until we reach a large number of flights on a given system, we should be prepared for periodic failures -- far more than we would expect or tolerate with our cars and planes. And since we hope to put people atop many of these systems, we need to reach high flight count goals as soon as possible! It will be hard to consider truly democratized affordable access to space for the general public, until we do so.

Syria s Kobane will not fall in the hands of ISIS: US-led coalition chiefUS-led coalition chief said he didn't think Kobane was about to fall in the hands of ISIS.
By: Agence-France Presse | Dubai | Posted: October 30, 2014 6:24 am
The coordinator of the US-led coalition against the Islamic State group voiced confidence today that Iraqi Kurdish reinforcements would stop the jihadists capturing the Syrian town of Kobane.
“We don’t think Kobane is about to fall in the hands of ISIS,” retired US general John Allen told Al- Arabiya television, using an alternative acronym for IS.
“The entrance of peshmerga fighters will prevent that,” he said, referring to Iraqi Kurdish fighters who are in Turkey waiting to deploy to the Syrian border town.
Under heavy US pressure, Turkey announced last week it would allow fighters from Iraq’s autonomous Kurdish region to travel through its territory to reinforce Kobane’s beleaguered Syrian Kurdish defenders.
Flashing victory signs, the fighters, armed with machineguns, heavy artillery and rocket launchers, received a euphoric welcome from Turkish Kurds who lined the road shouting “Long live peshmerga!”
The town has become a symbol of the battle against IS, an extremist Sunni Muslim group that has seized swathes of Syria and Iraq, committing atrocities and declaring an Islamic “caliphate”.
US warplanes carried out eight air raids near Kobane yesterday and today that targeted vehicles, a building and several IS fighting positions, the US military said.

By Jeffrey Heller
JERUSALEM, Oct 29 (Reuters) - An anonymous U.S. official's  reported description of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a  "chickenshit," or worthless coward, drew a sharp response on  Wednesday from the Israeli leader - no stranger to acrimony with  the Obama administration.
The American broadside, in an interview in The Atlantic  magazine, followed a month of heated exchanges between the  Netanyahu government and Washington over settlement building in  Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem, which Palestinians seek as the  capital of a future state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
"The thing about Bibi is, he's a chickenshit," the  unidentified official was quoted as saying, using Netanyahu's  nickname and a slang insult certain to redden the ears of the  U.S.-educated former commando.
"The good thing about Netanyahu is that he's scared to  launch wars," the official said, in apparent reference to past  hints of possible Israeli military action against Iran's nuclear  program. "The bad thing about him is that he won't do anything  to reach an accommodation with the Palestinians or with the  Sunni Arab states."
Netanyahu, the official was reported to have said, is  interested only in "protecting himself from political defeat ...  He's got no guts."
Israeli leaders usually do not respond to comments by  unidentified officials. But Netanyahu addressed those remarks  directly in opening a memorial ceremony in parliament for an  Israeli cabinet minister assassinated by a Palestinian in 2001.
"Our supreme interests, chiefly the security and unity of  Jerusalem, are not the main concern of those anonymous officials  who attack us and me personally, as the assault on me comes only  because I defend the State of Israel," Netanyahu said.
"...Despite all of the attacks I suffer, I will continue to  defend our country. I will continue to defend the citizens of  Israel," he said.
Such pledges by Netanyahu have resonated among Israeli  voters, even amid fears his strained relations with U.S.  President Barack Obama could ultimately weaken support from  Israel's main diplomatic ally and arms provider.
Some pundits predict an Israeli election in 2015, two years  early, speculation seemingly supported by the absence of any  strong challenger to the Likud party leader and increasingly  vocal challenges to his policies from senior ministers to the  left and right of him within the coalition government.
Economy Minister Naftali Bennett, whose ultranationalist  Jewish Home party belongs to the coalition but who has had testy  relations with Netanyahu, defended him on Facebook.
"The prime minister of Israel is not a private person. He is  the leader of the Jewish state and the entire Jewish people.  Cursing the prime minister and calling him names is an insult  not just to him but to the millions of Israeli citizens and Jews  across the globe," he wrote.
Israeli opposition leader Isaac Herzog sounded a more  critical note, telling Channel Two television: "Netanyahu is  acting like a political pyromaniac, and he has brought our  relations with the United States to an unprecedented low."
FRICTION
In a series of recent speeches widely seen in Israel as  setting the stage for a possible poll, Netanyahu has highlighted  growing security concerns in the wake of the July-August war  with Hamas in Gaza and regional unrest that has brought Islamist  militants to Israel's northern border with Syria.
Israel also worries that U.S.-led world powers will agree to  what it deems insufficient curbs on the nuclear program of its  arch-foe, Iran, in talks with a looming Nov 24 deadline.
Fears of a possible new Palestinian Intifada, or uprising,  have been stoked in Israel by now-daily rock-throwing by  Palestinians in Jerusalem amid Muslim fears of an end to an  Israeli de facto ban on Jewish worship at the al-Aqsa mosque  compound in the holy city where Biblical temples once stood.
Netanyahu has pledged to preserve the "status quo" at the  site, a commitment Palestinian leaders view with suspicion.
But drawing Palestinian outrage and a State Department  accusation that Israel was distancing peace, Netanyahu pledged  on Monday to fast-track plans for 1,000 new settler homes in  Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem.
Netanyahu described such criticism as being "detached from  reality," saying Jews had a right to live anywhere in Jerusalem,  regarded by Israel as its united capital - a claim not  internationally recognized.
Most countries and the World Court deem the settlements  Israel has built in areas captured in a 1967 war to be illegal.  Israel disputes this, and has settled 500,000 Jews in East  Jerusalem and the West Bank, among 2.4 million Palestinians.     (Editing by Dan Williams and Dominic Evans)

Artist Melts 100 Tons Of Ice As Physical Reminder Of Climate Changereddit
When 100 tons of Arctic sheet ice is sitting in the middle of your town square, it's difficult to avoid talking about climate change. Just ask the folks in Copenhagen, who have come face-to-ice with 12 large blocks of frozen fjord water, all in the name of environmental art.
The Danes have artist Olafur Eliasson to thank for the strange configuration of Greenland-bred ice. It's part of a project titled " Ice Watch ," involving a dozen icy chunks arranged to resemble an ominous clock. Though the pieces look as though they've been surreptitiously washed ashore in the middle of a city, the melting artifacts serve as a direct call to arms: it represents the amount of ice that disappears every 100th of a second due to conditions of global warming.

"The ice is melting," a description of the project proclaims. "Sea levels are rising. Temperatures are rising. Climate change is a fact."
Eliasson worked with geologist Minik Rosing to create the installation, which is enjoying its last day on view this Wednesday. The two conceived of the project following a discussion about the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 's Fifth Assessment Report with the Danish Ministry of Climate, Energy and Building. Copenhagen, which seeks to become carbon neutral by 2025, is hosting the panel this month.
The ice of "Ice Watch" indeed weighs in at a whopping 100 tons, having been collected by Royal Arctic Line divers and dockworkers near the Nuup Kangerlua fjord outside Nuuk, Greenland. The pieces were shipped in four refrigerated containers to Denmark before being left to melt in the middle of the central city square. As they crack, break and disappear, members of the public are able to witness firsthand the death of Arctic ice. Frank Jensen, Copenhagen's mayor, and Rasmus Helveg Petersen, the Danish Minister for Climate, Energy and Building, stand behind the striking show.

"Olafur Eliasson and Minik Rosing have created a work of art with 100 tons of inland ice. This number corresponds to the amount of inland ice melting every hundredth of a second," Petersen remarked in a press statement. "We can save the ice by burning less coal, conserving electricity, and driving better cars."
"'Ice Watch' is an earnest reminder to us all about what is happening right now with the inland ice," Jensen added.
For Eliasson, "perception and physical experience" are important facets of art, just as they are integral aspects of social activism. "As an artist, I am interested in how we give knowledge a body. What does a thought feel like, and how can felt knowledge encourage action?" he explained. " We are all part of the ‘global we’; we must all work together to ensure a stable climate for future generations."

Eliasson has worked with ice before, once carting sizable chunks from Iceland’s largest glacier, Vatnajökull, to the halls of MoMA PS1 in New York City. Visitors could walk around these ice pieces as well, while the blocks slowly melted in a refrigerated space kept just below freezing temperatures. "The physical experience of centuries-old ice from the glaciers of Eliasson’s native Iceland makes tangible a history that extends beyond the human life span," a description for the 2013 project states, "time that is measured in thousands of years rather than mere decades."
You might wonder why Eliasson has been so quick to take ice -- a dwindling part of Earth's landscape -- out of its natural environment. We reached out to the artist to find out, and he had this to say:
"The icebergs transported to Copenhagen were fished out of the fjord, that is, [they] had already calved off the ice cap and had been irreversibly lost to the sea. The icebergs on the Town Hall Square in Copenhagen are symbols of a problem of global scale. The amount of ice transported to Copenhagen from the Nuuk Fjord has no significance on the scale of the loss of ice from the Greenland Ice Cap. The 100 tons melting in Copenhagen is the amount that is melting from the Greenland Ice Cap in 1/100 of a second. The incomprehensible scale of the loss due to warming of the Arctic is the very reason why the problem has to be addressed and public awareness must be raised."

Grooming Great Employees: What a Service Dog Can Teach Us About Developing Talentreddit
There are at least a dozen dogs in my advertising agency on any day of the week. They run down halls, chase balls, gnaw on toys, snooze during meetings, and are eager for quick walks when their human companions need a work break.
Some months ago I noticed that Dreyfus, a Golden Labrador that has been with us since earlier this year, stood out from the canine pack in our Bluffton, S.C., office. Even though he was just 8 weeks old when a staffer brought him in, it was soon clear that Dreyfus was a little more mature than most of the pooches in residence at BFG. He reminded me of a talented intern with shimmering ambition and potential that makes others seem less remarkable.
Dreyfus, it turns out, is on the job. While alert and watchful, he stays close to Dan Comite, his human companion, and a sign that reads: "Service dog in training. Please refrain from petting." Dreyfus comes from the Canine Companions for Independence organization and Dan is a volunteer "Puppy Raiser" for the organization. That means he provides specific socialization and obedience training that will help Dreyfus ultimately master more than 40 specialized commands. This dog is being trained to make a world of difference to his next owner, who may be blind, hard of hearing, facility-bound or need help at home and in a busy work environment like ours. As much as we love having him around, Dreyfus has more important work to do after he cuts his teeth at BFG Communications.
Dog lovers know there is much we can learn from canine companions. And, as I watch Dreyfus grow and mature, his training with Dan reminds me of the importance of doing the right thing when it comes to grooming the best and brightest young human talent and preparing them for success in our office -- or in another part of the world:
First, tap the right talent. It isn't always easy to spot -- dare I say it?-- the pick of the litter during interviews. But there are ways to identify hidden talent in waiting. Good schools, summer jobs, first jobs, titles, growth, references and that certain "spark" of drive and eagerness to learn and do well mean a lot. It was not by random choice that Dreyfus qualified as an assistance dog candidate. He was selected based on strict criteria including temperament, trainability, littermate trends and the production history of the dam and sire. Only the "best of the best" are chosen as CCI breeder dogs, and only a few of their puppies ultimately qualify. While employers don't get or even need all that information, it is important to focus keenly on thoroughly vetting and selecting the best of the best for employment. A forced fit or a rushed hire usually doesn't work out.
Develop and assign mentors. Puppies in training require a safe environment and supervision throughout the entire day. We often hire young people right out of college and we give them as much responsibility as they can handle. Watching Dreyfus I'm reminded that on-the-job training only goes so far and it's no substitute for a strong mentor, supervision and regular progress reports.
Teach business-social etiquette. Dan spends a lot of his time with Dreyfus providing the puppy with age-appropriate socialization opportunities. I'm reminded just how important it is to get our less experienced talent in front of clients and comfortable in all types of social situations. It's important that rising stars know how to mix business and pleasure in a professional way. This is often forgotten.
Consistent feedback. One thing that stands out the most to me as I watch Dan and Dreyfus is the delivery of consistent rewards and recognition for a job well done. To be sure, Dan let's Dreyfus know when he has disappointed, but when Dreyfus performs well, he knows he will get a rewarding pat, verbal recognition and, very often, a treat. There are no mixed or ambiguous signals.
Work hard, play hard. Dreyfus doesn't work his entire day. In his first few months he had plenty of time to chase balls and tumble around with other dogs, even disrupt a meeting with an occasional high-pitched bark. Even now, when he seems most content working with Dan, he loves a brisk walk or a chance to romp outside.
Dreyfus, increasingly, stands out from the pack. It's obvious to us that he is meant to play a bigger role elsewhere. We'll be sad and Dan will certainly share a tear when it's time to say goodbye to this dog.
In this, too, there is a lesson: While I am often disappointed when some of our best talent leaves for other job opportunities, I hope I can learn to be more thankful for the time they were with us and wish them well. Who knows? Dreyfus is unlikely to find his way back to us, but sometimes good people do return to -- or, at least, remember fondly -- a place that helped them learn and succeed.

5 Easy Tactics to Reduce Abandoned Carts During the Holidaysreddit
Just like death and taxes, nothing is as certain in e-commerce as abandoned carts. Various studies show that 45-70 percent of all shopping carts don't end in a purchase, which means that you and your online business are fully aware of the frustration that abandoned carts can bring. And with Volusion predicting 9 percent holiday growth for small- and medium-sized online businesses this year, every cart counts.
Fortunately, there are some very common and easy-to-address themes that lead to abandoned carts. These include: shipping costs and issues, shoppers browsing products and comparing prices, security concerns, and a lack of payment options, all of which can be overcome by following these 5 easy steps.
1. Prevent "shipping sticker shock"
A June 2014 report from UPS and comScore indicates that 58% of shoppers abandon their cart because shipping costs made the total purchase more than expected, a phenomenon known as "shipping sticker shock." This consumer behavior is unique to online shopping, yet understandable as shipping costs are never an additional cost when making purchases in-store. Long story short, online shoppers often forget that shipping charges are involved, and frequently don't see additional shipping fees until reaching the checkout page.
To help prevent shipping sticker shock, give these tricks a try:
Implement a tool that allows users to estimate shipping and tax before they reach checkout. This tool allows shoppers to enter their state and zip code and receive the associated shipping cost before pulling out their credit card.
Offer multiple shipping options so customers can select the most affordable shipping option.
Have your default shipping option always be the cheapest to reduce the subtotal of the order.
2. Create a sense of urgency so shoppers "buy now"
The UPS/comScore study also shows that 57% of shoppers abandoned their cart because they were comparing prices on other sites. These behaviors are even more prominent during the holiday season, as frugal shoppers are looking to find the best deal possible. The key here is to convince shoppers to stay on your site and make a quick purchase by creating a sense of urgency with your marketing and messaging.
Here are three solid approaches to keep shoppers from leaving your site to compare prices:
Prominently display coupons throughout your site, particularly within the header so they're visible across pages. (Free shipping and percentage-off discounts are particularly effective during the holidays.)
Leverage email and social media to offer limited-time offers and flash sales on specific products - this creates excitement and a feeling of scarcity with customers, meaning they're more likely to make an impulse buy directly on your site.
Consider offering a low-price guarantee, but only if you can afford it. Research from Conversions on Demand showed a 9 percent improvement in conversion rates by adding messaging on the product page that stated, "Low Price Guarantee - Find a Lower Price and We'll Match It!"
3. Ensure site speed and navigation are highly efficient
This holiday season is one of the shortest on record, with only 26 days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. This condensed timeline means shoppers will be more pressed for time, so every second counts, literally. In fact, CPC Strategy reports that 47% of consumers expect a web page to load in 2 seconds or less. Not only that, hurried shoppers are looking for a simplified website experience, desiring the ability to efficiently find the products they want and quickly check out.
To improve site speed and navigation efficiencies, give these ideas a shot:
Don't require account registration upfront. 28% of shoppers abandon their carts because they didn't want to register or create an account just to make a purchase.
Perform a site speed test with a free or paid tool and take measures, like reducing file sizes and the amount of rich media on your site, to improve overall speed and load times.
Avoid asking unnecessary questions on the checkout page. While tempting to gain additional customer insights, only require the minimum amount of information for the transaction to occur.
4. Offer a large selection of payment methods
Holiday shoppers have a wide range of payment preferences. Some are loyal to a specific credit card so they can rack up points, while others stick to their debit cards to keep their budgets in check. Increasingly, more and more shoppers are leveraging tools like PayPal for their online transactions. Whatever the case, the more payment options you offer on your site, the more likely you are to reduce abandoned carts.
When it comes to accepting payments this holiday season, keep these ideas in mind:
Offer myriad payment options, with the minimum being major credit cards, debit cards, and PayPal.
Proactively display your payment options on your website, including the footer your checkout page - this approach lets customers know how they can pay early on.
Watch your costs when it comes to payment processing. For example, American Express charges an extra amount to you as a merchant, so if certain payment options are out of budget, don't feel obligated to offer them.
5. Reassure shoppers that your site is safe and secure
Increased security concerns will have an impact on shoppers, as we have seen a large rise in targeted attacks, security breaches and online identity theft. If you think back on this year alone, major incidents like those at Target and the online security gap of Heartbleed are still fresh on shoppers' minds. Fortunately, all you need to do is provide a bit of reassurance to customers that your site is a trustworthy place to conduct business.
To show shoppers that your site is secure, do the following:
Display security seals, including your SSL, throughout your site and checkout page.
Prominently display contact information, particularly real-time options like online chat and phone support.
Create a clean, professional site design to boost credibility. As they say, perception is everything.
This year's holiday season is projected to be the biggest in e-commerce history, which means that every visitor presents a chance to boost your sales and profitability. By knowing the main reasons that shoppers abandon their carts and taking action now, you'll convert more sales throughout the holiday season and well into the coming year.

Sensex ends at all-time high; Nifty likely to hit 8300 soon

MUMBAI: The benchmark indices ended at all-time closing highs led by gains in technology, oil & gas, banks and realty sectors even as the US ended its Quantitative Easing program.
The market recorded its highest ever turnover at Rs 10.5 lakh crore.
According to analysts, the market is in bull-grip and the momentum is likely to take Nifty to 8,300 in November series itself.
The S&P BSE Sensex surged 6,060 in last 52-weeks to hit an all-time high of 27390.07 in trade today.
It ended at all-time closing high of 27,346.33, up 248.16 points or 0.92 per cent. The index touched an intraday low of 27088.65.
The Nifty has rallied 1,870 points in the last one year to close at an all-time closing high of 8169.20. The index hit an all-time high of 8,181.55 and intraday low of 8,085.20 today.
"We have seen an extremely good spirited sort of a bounce back and who would have thought that QE ending and close near 8,200 would actually coincide," said market expert Ambareesh Baliga.
"We are close to the top end of the band and crossing these levels will be a bit difficult. In case we cross this, technically there is the possibility the markets can go 8,350. It would be more of a trading bet than buying for an investment at this point of time," he added.
The S&P BSE Midcap Index gained 0.66 per cent and the S&P BSE Smallcap Index was 0.34 per cent higher.
Among the sectoral indices, the S&P BSE IT Index gained 2.04 per cent, the S&P BSE Oil & gas Index was 1.65 per cent higher, the S&P BSE Bankex rose 0.72 per cent and the S&P BSE Realty Index surged 3.44 per cent.

The Nartaka festival will highlight the contribution of nattuvanar Pandanallur Subbaraya Pillai at a three day event.
The eighth edition of the Nartaka Festival organised by Natyanjali Trust, Chennai, will celebrate the centenary of Pandanainallur C. Subbaraya Pillai, renowned nattuvanar, musician and an illustrious torchbearer of the legacy of the legendary Pandanallur Meenakshisundaram Pillai between October 30 and November 2 at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mylapore,.
Prema Satish, managing trustee, and Jayalakshmi Satagopan, her mother and Founder of the Natyanjali Trust, have been disciples of Subbaraya Pillai.
Born in December 1914, Subbaraya Pillai was the son of the reputed Chokkalingam Pillai, who was a relative and the first and foremost disciple of Meenakshisundaram Pillai. He was a dedicated adherent to the values imparted by his forefathers in the field of Bharatanatyam, focussing on aspects of proper paddhati with perfectly aligned rhythmical nuances set to intricate musical elements that are integral to this tradition.
“Composing adavus based on the musical pattern of the swara segments without exploiting the rhythmical frame too much in pure dance sections, keeping in mind the importance of the link between music and the adavu patterns is an important feature of this tradition” said this doyen in his interview for The Hindu, a few weeks before his demise in May 2008. His deep belief in upholding the patantara as handed down by the senior exponents of his family was unshakeable and he appreciated those who sincerely followed his tradition.
Subbaraya Pillai began training with his father first and continued with Meenakshisundaram Pillai. He started accompanying the students of Meenakshsundaram Pillai at a young age, as a vocalist and assisted in nattuvangam. His proficiency as a vocalist was widely known and he was respected equally for his expertise in nattuvangam, which had an innate musical quality, bringing forth the unique touch of the great master.
On November 2, 6 p.m., Natyanjali Trust will honour Bharatanatyam exponent V.P. Dhananjayan with the ‘Nartaka Award 2014’, which will be presented by Umayalapuram K. Sivaraman, veteran mridangam exponent. Guest of honour and the first recipient of the Nartaka Award, Prof. C.V. Chandrasekhar, will perform after the award ceremony. The festival will feature a number of young male dancers such as Christoper Gurusamy, B. Harikrishnan, Praveen Kumar, Shankar Kandaswamy, Santosh Radhakrishnan, Ajit Bhaskaran and Justin McCarthy.

Motorola is now a LenovocompanyLenovo wraps up $2.9 billion purchase of Motorola Mobility from Google.
By: AP | Beijing | Posted: October 30, 2014 6:17 pm | Updated: October 31, 2014 7:10 am
Chinese computer maker Lenovo Group has completed its acquisition of Motorola Mobility from Google Inc. in a move aimed at becoming a global smartphone brand.
Lenovo said it completed the $2.9 billion purchase on Thursday, adding to a flurry of acquisitions and initiatives aimed at transforming the world’s biggest maker of personal computers into a major player in wireless computing.
Google bought Motorola Mobility in 2012 for $12.4 billion but appeared to decide quickly the purchase was a mistake. It sold its set-top operations to Arris Group Inc. for $2.35 billion and its smartphone assets, along with some 2,000 patents, to Lenovo.
Lenovo chairman Yang Yuanqing said when the purchase was announced in January that it would help transform Lenovo into a global competitor in smartphones.

Rs 5 lakh additional compensation each to kin of 1984 anti-Sikh riotvictimsPrint

Written by Vijaita Singh | New Delhi | Posted: October 31, 2014 12:05 am | Updated: October 31, 2014 7:14 am
The NDA government has decided to give Rs 5 lakh each to the next of kin of those killed in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, government officials said on Thursday.
The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has taken a decision to disburse around Rs 166 crore to the families of 3,325 victims killed in the riots but the money has not been released yet, a senior Home Ministry official said.
The decision to enhance the compensation was taken by Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh last week, just before the by-elections were announced for three assembly seats in Delhi.
“The government had received representations from various Sikh groups and it was felt that the compensation given to the riot victims was not adequate. It was decided to give an enhanced compensation of Rs 5 lakh each to the next of kin of the victims,” said the official.
The official said the compensation will be given in addition to what they have received in all these years but it will be disbursed only after the by-elections in Delhi are over as the model code of conduct is in place.
In 2006, the UPA government had announced a Rs 717 crore rehabilitation package for anti-Sikh riots victims after the Nanawati Commission, which was set up to probe the anti-Sikh riots, submitted its report. According to the package, an ex-gratia amount of Rs.3.5 lakh each to the next of kin riot victims was disbursed. Out of this only Rs 517 crore had been spent and the remaining Rs 200 crore could not be distributed because of dispute over claimants.
“A thorough review was done and it was found that Rs 3.5 lakh was not enough to compensate the families of riot victims who have suffered all these years. On compassionate grounds, the amount was hiked to Rs 5 lakh,” said the official.
Of the 3,325 victims, 2,733 were killed in Delhi alone while rest of the victims were from Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and other states.
The Home Ministry also enhanced the compensation to civilian victims of communal, terrorist or Naxal violence from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh.

Internal elections unlikely to change Mizo National Front leadershipline-upPrint
Written by Adam Halliday | Aizawl | Posted: October 30, 2014 6:48 pm | Updated: October 30, 2014 6:49 pm
In spite of suffering its two worst electoral defeats in the past decade, there seems unlikely to be any change in the Mizo National Front leadership as the party heads for internal elections next month.
The party that ruled Mizoram for two consecutive terms between 1998 and 2008 was decimated in the 2008 state-wide elections and reduced to occupying just three of the assembly’s 40 seats. It slightly improved its tally in 2013 and won five seats.
Nevertheless, the main opposition party’s top five leaders have once again been nominated uncontested for the exact same posts they have been occupying by the party’s National Executive Meeting on Thursday at Aizawl.
Significantly, both Zoramthanga and Tawnluia were re-nominated without any contestants for the post of President and Senior Vice President respectively.
In a way, the uncontested nominations show the party’s continued deference for leaders who once spent two decades as guerilla fighters in a bid to win an independent country for Mizos in India, Bangladesh and Myanmar.
The other three leaders re-nominated on Thursday were not part of the MNF uprising, as it is often called, a period that saw an entire division of the Indian Army (assisted in the beginning by the IAF) move into present-day Mizoram to subjugate the separatist movement.
The re-nominations also shows the unchanged leadership preference of most senior party workers in spite of staring at the prospect of spending a decade out of power.
Of the top five, only one (former MP Vanlalzawma) is currently an MLA. he has been re-nominated to be Treasurer.
Three others — former CM Zoramthanga, former Home Minister Tawnluia and former Health Minister R Tlanghmingthanga — have lost two consecutive elections.
A fifth (former Education Minister Dr R Lalthangliana) lost, albeit by a margin of less than a hundred votes, to a first-time Congress candidate in last year’s assembly polls. He has been renominated as one of the two Vice Presidents, along with R Tlanghmingthanga.
Although it will remain open for other party leaders to contest against any of these five leaders before party elections take place on November 14, it appears unlikely that will be the case.
Insiders said a move to introduce the secret ballot system in the party polls was shot down after prolonged debate at Thursday’s meeting, meaning the mid-November elections will be decided by a show of hands once again.

US economy grew at 3.5 per cent rate in Q3US economy grew 3.5 per cent in third quarter

(The US economy grew at an…)
WASHINGTON: The US economy grew at a solid annual rate of 3.5 per cent in the July-September quarter, propelled by solid gains in business investment, export sales and the biggest jump in military spending in five years.
The third quarter result, which was slightly better than economists expected, followed a 4.6 per cent rebound in the second quarter, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. The economy shrank at a 2.1 per cent rate in the first three months of the year due to a harsh winter.
The report was the first of three estimates of the gross domestic product, the economy's total output of goods and services. Analysts believe the economy is maintaining momentum in the current quarter, with a big fall in gas prices expected to bolster consumer spending. After the roller-coaster first- and second-quarter gyrations, the economy is poised to achieve consistently stronger growth for the rest of this year and all of 2015.
``The economy does appear to be accelerating of late,'' said Dan Greenhaus, an analyst with investment firm BTIG. He added that the GDP report showed an economy ``on a sounder footing today than at any time over the last few years.''
Many economists think full-year growth for 2015 will hit 3 per cent, giving the economy the best annual performance since 2005, two years before the Great Recession began.
For the third quarter, consumer spending grew at a solid 1.8 per cent annual rate. That was slower than the 2.5 per cent increase in the spring quarter, a gain that reflected pent-up demand as consumers made up for missed shopping days during the winter storms.
Consumer spending contributed 1.2 per centage points to growth in the third quarter. Another major contribution came from an 11 per cent rise in export sales, far outpacing imports, which fell at a 1.7 rate. The smaller trade gap added 1.3 per centage points to growth in the third quarter.
The data comes amid concern that the export boom may soon fade due to weakness overseas. Europe is on the brink of its third recession in seven years, Japan is faltering, and China and Brazil are also struggling.
Stronger government spending added another 0.8 per centage point to growth, with federal spending growing at a 10 per cent rate. It was the first positive contribution in more than two years. Federal activity had been constrained by spending cuts and last year's partial government shutdown.
  Defense spending shot up at a 16 per cent rate, the fastest advance since a 17.4 per cent gain in the second quarter of 2009.
Business spending on equipment grew at a 7.2 per cent rate in the third quarter, and residential construction grew at a 1.8 per cent rate. While an increase, it marked a slowdown from 8.8 per cent growth in housing in the second quarter.
Much of the optimism for the economy going forward stems from the strength of job growth, which has lowered the unemployment rate to a six-year low of 5.9 per cent. In September, the economy added 248,000 jobs, extending a string of strong gains.
The additional workers should translate into more income and consumer spending, which accounts for 70 per cent of economic activity.
The Federal Reserve noted the brightening US prospects as it ended a policy meeting Wednesday. It retained language in a statement saying it didn't expect to raise its benchmark interest rate for a ``considerable time.'' But it also pointed to rising signs of strength, including job gains and lower unemployment.
Against that backdrop, the Fed ended its third round of bond buying. Over the past six years, the Fed has pumped more than $3 trillion into the economy through bond purchases designed to keep long-term rates low.
Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, said that the solid GDP report showed ``the Fed was right to take a slightly more hawkish tone.''
Most economists don't expect the Fed to begin raising rates before June. But they viewed the Fed's statement as a warning that if the economy strengthened more than expected in coming months, rate hikes could start occurring sooner than investors think.

KOCHI: In a shot in the arm for the Congress- led UDF government, which has set a goal of total prohibition by 2023, the Kerala High Court today held as valid its new excise policy paving the way for closure of 700 liquor bars attached to hotels in the state.
However, the court allowed 33 bars in four-star and heritage category hotels to function though the state government had banned bars in all hotels below the five-star status. Twenty bars in five-star hotels were allowed to function by the court.
The judgement was passed by Justice Surendra Mohan on a batch of petitions by Kerala Bar Owners against the state government's August 22 decision to close down bars attached to hotels below five-star category.
The ruling UDF had adopted the new liquor policy with view to reducing the availability of liquor in the state to achieve its goal of 'total prohibition by 2023'.
Justice Mohan said the excise policy for 2014-15 was formulated on the basis of judgements of high court and the Supreme Court and report of a one-man commission and recommendation of Tax Secretary of the state.
The court also relied on the apex court verdict that state would not deny bar licences to hotels with the classification of four star and above, the judge said.
He held that no materials had been placed before it to justify the conclusion that the August 22 policy was not supported by a decision of council of ministers.
In the absence of such materials, contention of bar hotels was rejected, the judge held.
The bar owners had approached the court contending that the government's decision to close the bars was taken in 'haste' and would be counter productive as it would lose substantial revenue from Abkari (excise) business, besides impacting tourism.

SHILLONG: The Meghalaya government will provide micro grid systems in some villages in the state where power will be generated using renewable resources and energy thus saved will be routed to industries, Chief Minister Mukul Sangma said today.
"We have identified certain villages in the state where there is a possibility of them being delinked from the main grid after they are provided with renewable power," Sangma said while addressing a national seminar on how power sector impacts on economic growth and industrial development.
He said these micro grid systems would be set up in a radius of one to two kms and in a cluster of villages, while generation of power would solely be on renewable resources like solar, wind and biomass.
The project, if successful, would be beneficial to the state and once the set up is in place and the clusters of villages delinked from the grid, the energy thus saved could be routed to industries where it (power) could be sold at a higher rate, the Chief Minister said.
Earlier, state Chief Secretary P B O Warjri said changes in the erstwhile electricity board to three fully corporatised bodies has faced some hiccups.
"There are many challenges as we change from a government- run culture (in the erstwhile Meghalaya Electricity Board ) to a corporate culture (the newly formed generation, transmission and distribution companies)," he said.
The new corporate bodies have to present their accounts professionally and adopt new ways of functioning, Warjri said.
Meghalaya Electricity Regulatory Commission chairman P Anand Kumar who also addressed the seminar, said the country in general and Meghalaya in particular has to generate five to six per cent more power if it expects its economy to grow by eight to nine per cent in a year.
Kumar also called for improvement of the transmission system, enabling states to share and exchange power during surplus periods and avail the same during lean seasons.

Alibaba plays trademark card to protect leadIn the letter, dated Oct 16, Alibaba's Tmall.com marketplace warned Chinese publishers against running ads with the "Double Eleven" motif that are not official Alibaba promotions.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
BEIJING: A trademark spat between Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and rival JD.com flared into public view after JD published an Alibaba letter urging publishers to be careful about advertising in promotions for China's annual "Singles' Day" spree, the world's largest online shopping day.
In the letter, dated October 16 and published on Thursday on a JD social media account, Alibaba's Tmall.com marketplace warned Chinese publishers against running ads with the "Double Eleven" motif that are not official Alibaba promotions. The slogan has become a well known reference to Nov. 11, when Singles' Day takes place each year, encouraging unattached consumers to buy goods as gifts for themselves.
Tmall said in the letter that "Double Eleven" is a registered trademark. According to research by Reuters, in 2013, Alibaba registered at least six trademarks associated with "Double Eleven" with the State Administration of Industry and Commerce.
The letter highlights fierce competition among e-commerce firms in China over their marketing efforts around Nov. 11, a day that has proved an online shopping bonanza. Total sales processed on Singles' Day last year approached $8 billion.
In the letter, which was published on a JD Weibo account, Tmall also condemned some of Alibaba's e-commerce rivals, without identifying names, and said media outlets would be liable for breach of trademark if they published any ads that infringed on Alibaba's rights.
"We express our extreme indignation and condemn some e-commerce companies for their demeaning activities," Alibaba's Tmall said in the letter, without disclosing specific examples of activities to which it objected. Tmall said publishers would bear joint liability for any breach of China's advertising law.
Officials at Alibaba and JD weren't immediately available for comment on Thursday.
JD said on Weibo that Alibaba's warning was counter to "the open spirit of the Internet and the principles of fair competition, and said the move would limit consumer choice and damage consumer interests.
For its part, Alibaba's letter amounted to a muscular effort to protect its lead on a hugely important day of sales.
Last year on Nov. 11, Alibaba's payment system alone processed $5.8 billion worth of transactions - more than the amount sold in the United States on Black Monday and Cyber Friday - with almost a third of China's population visiting Alibaba websites during the 24-hour period last year.
JD, a distant second to Alibaba in Chinese e-commerce, posted sales of $1.6 billion during its own Singles' Day promotion last year, which extended over 12 days.
Other internet merchants, including Amazon.com Inc, have already been rolling out promotions for the November shopping event. Amazon China announced on Wednesday that the company will focus on international brands during this year's Singles' Day event, allowing local customers to buy items and get direct shipments from the firm's international websites.

Boeing-Singapore Airlines JV gets CCI green ...Boeing
(Boeing Singapore would…)
NEW DELHI: Boeing Singapore, an arm of US major Boeing Company, and SIA Engineering Company's proposed joint venture has got the approval from fair trade regulator CCI, as the deal does not raise anti-competition concerns in the country.
Under the proposed combination, Boeing Singapore would hold 51 per cent stake in the Singapore-based joint venture company, while 49 per cent would be with SIA Engineering Company Ltd (SIAEC) - a subsidiary of Singapore Airlines .
The joint venture company would offer maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) services together with related engineering, logistics and supply chain and inventory management services in South Asia Pacific region, including India, with respect to certain aircrafts manufactured by the Boeing Company.
In an order released today, CCI said that "the proposed combination is not likely to have an appreciable adverse effect on competition in India".
CCI noted that the Boeing Company did not have arrangement with any of the Indian carriers or the MRO service providers in the country and that post combination "Indian carriers using Boeing aircrafts will be free to procure MRO services from any MRO service provider".
Further, the Boeing Company will not be prevented from supplying spare parts or technical support to MRO service providers in India.
The Commission said that the assessment with respect to the joint venture was limited to the effect of the proposed deal on two market segments - heavy maintenance and component maintenance. These segments fall under MRO services.
"It is observed that in both of the said segments of MRO services, the parties have no presence in India since neither the Boeing Company nor SIAEC provides any MRO services in India," CCI said in the order.
Observing that the Boeing Company, through its group companies, has provided adhoc services to Indian carriers outside India, CCI said the revenues from such services were "insignificant".
It also noted that several Indian players were "active in both these segments and have a significantly larger market share vis-a-vis the parties".
As per details in the order, post the combination, Boeing and SIAEC would "novate contracts" to the joint venture related to MRO services.
Following an agreement over the joint venture in July, this year, the companies had approached CCI for its green signal in August.
Boeing Singapore is currently engaged in the field of fleet management solutions, while SIAEC is into the business of provision of MRO services for aircraft, engines and related components.

New Gainful Employment Rule Is Weak  but Predatory For-profit Colleges Remain on the Ropesreddit
The Obama administration is releasing its "gainful employment" rule, aimed at curbing abuses by federally-funded career colleges, at 7 am Thursday.  I can't fully evaluate the rule without seeing its details. But I have obtained a press release and fact sheet provided by the administration to the media and also spoken to administration and other sources, and I have this to report: UPDATE [Oct. 30 11:00 am]: I've read the rule, and my views remain the same.
1. The rule is far too weak to address the grave misconduct of predatory for-profit colleges.  The administration missed an opportunity to issue a strong rule, to take strong executive action and provide real leadership on this issue.  However, the for-profit college industry remains on the ropes because its abuses have now been exposed -- in some measure as a result of the angry fight the industry has waged over gainful employment.  Federal and state law enforcement are engaged in serious investigations and lawsuits , the latest being a devastating complaint  filed by Wisconsin's attorney general against Corinthian Colleges alleging that the company's Everest campus in Milwaukee engaged in systematic lying to students about the urgency of enrolling, job placement, and other facts -- and replaced the campus president, seemingly for not going along with the fraud.  The media has focused on the industry's abuses, and, as the truth has reached prospective students, enrollments have dropped.
2. By eliminating the programmatic cohort default rate (pCDR) component of the draft rule released by the administration in March 2014, this final rule only addresses the plight of graduates, through provisions comparing the debt of grads to their earnings; it does almost nothing to deal with programs where the biggest problem is high dropout rates. Unfortunately, there is voluminous evidence that when for-profit colleges want students to drop out, they know how to make that happen -- by piling on more and more bills and forcing out students for alleged weak performance right up to graduation day.  So predatory schools can easily game the new rule, making their campuses dropout factories and only being measured by the fate of a small number of graduates (although, to be fair, the industry has proven adept at gaming and manipulating the school-level cohort default rates already required by law).  Multiple sources had told me that some administration lawyers pressed for such a debt-to-earnings-only rule , because they wanted a conservative approach aimed at satisfying a federal court, after the judge struck down the 2011 version of the rule over the administration's alleged failure to offer an adequate rationale for a test measuring the loan repayment rate of grads and dropouts alike.  (My colleagues and I met with Administration officials two weeks ago and sought, I guess unsuccessfully, to persuade them that these legal concerns were overblown. Because they are. )  Result: The rule is weaker than the March proposed rule, both because it fails to deal with the non-completers and because, according to sources, it lengthens transition periods before the rule's penalties kick in.
3.  However, in significant respects today's final rule is stronger than the rule that the administration issued in 2011 -- the rule that the for-profit college industry convinced a federal judge to strike down.  First, the debt to earnings test is somewhat more substantial than in the previous rule, although it remains too weak.  The Department of Education is saying that 1400 programs as currently performing would flunk the test -- more than seven times as many as would have flunked the 2011 rule.  Second, although the 2011 rule had the repayment rate test that addressed dropouts, in that version of the rule, a program would remain eligible for aid unless it repeatedly flunked both the repayment and debt-to-earnings tests. In other words, the repayment rate test functioned as a life raft for programs that failed the debt-to-earnings test.  The final rule issued today eliminates that life raft -- all programs must pass the debt to earnings test. So, while not as strong as the March 2014 draft, under which programs had to pass both the debt to earnings and the pCDR, the rule does make it more likely, as compared with the 2011 rule, that bad programs will eventually flunk and lose eligibility for federal aid.
In 2011, the administration insisted that the furious campaign of lobbying -- ranging from sending in emissaries to charm their old friends in the White House to issuing threats -- directed at the administration by the for-profit college industry was not a factor in its decision to water down its gainful employment rule. No doubt the administration will claim the same again, despite the visit to the White House by Kaplan head Don Graham to see his friend Jeffrey Zients, the National Economic Council director; despite, I have heard, the last-minute call to the White House by a former very senior Obama White House official on behalf of one of the industry's biggest companies; despite the millions spent by industry lobbying this year.
The industry, led by former congressman Steve Gunderson, head of their trade group APSCU, is already thundering its disapproval of the new gainful employment rule, and they are almost certain to challenge it in court and on Capitol Hill again.  That's because the barons who run APSCU and the big for-profit college companies believe they are entitled to a permanent flow of taxpayer billions, regardless of the poor quality and astronomical prices of the programs they deliver to students, and regardless of the documented frauds and deceptions.  Their opposition, however intense and expensively announced, says nothing about the appropriateness of the rule.
As part of today's announcement, the administration committed to formalize a federal interagency task force to address for-profit college abuses and work with state attorneys general probing the industry.  It pledged other measures, and the historically reticent Department of Education showed this year that it knows how to use its existing authorities in forcing the decline of the awful Corinthian Colleges.  All of that is good, because there is still much more work to do to curb the deceptive and abusive practices of for-profit colleges, the fleecing of taxpayers, and the ruination of students' lives across the country.
The administration had the opportunity, through a strong gainful employment rule,  to demand here and now that federal aid only go to career education programs that were truly helping their students -- to address the documented performance failures of an industry funded some 85 percent by taxpayers, and respond, with moral outrage, to the grave abuses of the cynical bad actors who dominate the sector. It didn't seize the chance.  This struggle goes on.   Our coalition won't rest until students and taxpayers are protected against predatory education companies, until our country makes a real commitment to supporting genuine career education, not the enrichment of sharp operators.  We are grateful for the public servants who continue to work toward that goal.

In Big-Money Move  Corporations Seek to Make Congress a Wholly-Owned SubsidiaryAs Election Day approaches, two reports show us exactly how corrupted our political system has become. Unless voters come out in force, it looks like corporate money is about to buy itself another house of Congress.
The Wall Street Journal analyzed filings from the Federal Election Commission and concluded that
In a significant shift, business groups gave more money to Republican candidates than to Democrats in seven of the most competitive Senate races in recent months, in some cases taking the unusual step of betting against sitting senators.
The Journal found that corporate PACs gave most of their donations to Democrats in the early part of the campaign. That fits with a longstanding pattern: big-business interests shower incumbents with money to encourage special treatment, both during the election year and in the upcoming term.
But giving has shifted dramatically since June. The Journal discovered that Republican candidates received the lion's share of corporate campaign contributions in the July-to-September time period. The cash-generating power of incumbency had faded -- for Democrats.
One reason for the shift, according to sources, is a sense that Democrats are the underdogs. "Wall Street expects return on investment," a brokerage executive told the Journal. "It makes no sense to contribute to a losing campaign."
The other reason, of course, is ideologically-based. Corporations feel more comfortable abandoning incumbent Democrats than they do turning their backs on more reliably loyal Republicans. Mitch McConnell has been awash in corporate cash this year, for example -- thanks to his far-right stance, his chances of re-election, and the position of influence he would hold as Majority Leader if the GOP captures the Senate.
In a related report, Public Citizen analyzed the flow of "dark money" (from groups which don't have to disclose their donors) and found that the United States Chamber of Commerce,the largest dark-money spender, "is leaving a huge footprint in almost every race it enters."
As of October 25, the Chamber had spent $31.8 million on House and Senate races. The second-largest dark-money spender, Karl Rove's Crossroads GPS, had spent $23.5 million. Other big-spending dark-money groups include "Patriot Majority USA," the extremist "Americans for Prosperity," and the National Rifle Association.
Public Citizen found that the Chamber was "the biggest spender among non-disclosing outside groups in 28 of 35 races in which it has gotten involved. It is the second-biggest non-disclosing spender in three races, and the third-biggest dark money spender in four races."
This dark money is being spent in as lopsided a manner as that of the business PACs analyzed by the Wall Street Journal, with Public Citizen concluding that "almost all of the money the Chamber has spent has gone to aid Republicans or hinder Democrats ... The Chamber has not spent any money supporting Democrats."
The Nation's George Zornick (who we interviewed about the election last week on The Zero Hour ) notes that "the Chamber is a 501(c)(6) tax-exempt organization, meaning it doesn't have to disclose its donors." Zornick adds that publicly-available data reveals that "much of the Chamber's money has generally come from titans in the oil, banking and agriculture industries, among others."
In the past, many Congressional Democrats were able to count on the power of incumbency to trump party affiliation or the "liberal" label when it came time to collect corporate cash. But as Republicans have become increasingly shameless in their subservience to business interests - remember " Washington is here to serve the banks "? - corporations may sense that the time is coming when no longer need to compromise with government at all. From the Wall Street Journal:
"It's increasingly likely we're going to reestablish a pro-business majority in the Senate," said Rob Engstrom, national political director of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which mostly backs conservative candidates. He said President Barack Obama and other party leaders had made Democratic candidates "vulnerable, so companies aren't going to write PAC checks to candidates who fundamentally don't represent their interests."
If the incumbents in Washington haven't been representing corporate interests effectively, it's hard to imagine who could. Both corporate profits and the personal wealth of the 1 percent soared in the aftermath of a financial crisis which left most Americans worse off than ever before.
Perhaps Engstrom meant to say "companies aren't going to write PAC checks to candidates who don't solely represent their interests." From the looks of things, Corporate America is no longer content with buying political influence. Now it wants to turn Congress into a wholly-owned subsidiary. And it may well succeed, unless the voters thwart them on Tuesday.
For Democrats in Congress, perhaps the moral of the story is this: Don't chase their money, because they'll still betray you in the end -- just like they did on Social Security . Instead of kowtowing to them, fight them. You may not be able to outspend your opponents, but that option seems to be disappearing anyway. At least that way you'll have the voters on your side.
For the American people, the moral of this story couldn't be clearer: If we don't get money out of politics, we'll lose our democracy altogether.

Oil -- A Question of Economicsreddit
The recent debate over falling oil prices has become an over simplified economic question of supply and demand, ignoring other interrelated economic theories. Despite the global recession, oil demand has remained at 90-91 million barrels per day (mbd) over the past 5 years. However, due to the recession, Western nations have slowly reduced their demand. Meanwhile low growth, fuel efficiency, and demand in Asia has risen to compensate for this fall. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has reduced its growth forecasts for 2015 suggesting that demand may grow modestly by a 1 mbd to nearly 93 mbd.
Despite the political instability in parts of the MENA region, supply has managed to keep up with demand. This is largely due to the emergence of shale oil in the United States, which has ramped up its production to 8.7 mbd, which is 1 mbd more than last year. Some commentators even suggest that US oil production may reach up to 12 mbd by 2015. Meanwhile, Russia has also been putting record volumes of crude oil on to the market.
A decrease in demand and an increase of supply has caused oil prices to fall over the past five years from an average of $110 to $85 per barrel this year. The oil and gas media are full of doom and gloom about how these prices are unaffordable for the Middle Eastern nations who will now rack up budget deficits if the current price level persists. Some media outlets have even placed the blame of the price fall on OPEC's shoulders, citing the revival in production in Libya and Iraq for the current demise. OPEC has consistently produced around 30 mbd, reaching a peak in 2012 of 31 mbd and remains near to that today. However, the largest increase in world supply was brought on by the U.S. and its drive for self-sufficiency. The U.S.'s investment in shale oil has lead to an ever increasing supply coming on stream. This ultimately reduces the U.S.'s need for high priced imports, and leaves large quantities of West African oil looking for buyers. Under these conditions, the U.S. may soon be exporting oil into the market, although many commentators remain skeptical that the U.S. export ban will be lifted any time in the near future. Yet with or without the ban, the U.S. is already exporting record amounts of refined products and incidental condensates from its shale oil, leaving great impacts on prices in the oil markets.
With western media suggesting OPEC should reduce production and avoid deficit financing, there seems to be an issue of double standards arising. Should we ask the U.S. to abandon plans to export oil? Surely, the MENA countries could follow America's lead and ask China to finance its deficit as well and allow market capitalism to run its full course. The competition theory in economics tells us that high costs and inefficient producers will be driven out of the market as prices fall. Doing so would eventually drive out the high cost and environmentally threatening deep water, arctic, tar sands and shale oil fields. In the long run, higher output at lower prices will finance and in due time reduce the deficit of the low cost oil producers. In addition to this, the true cost benefit analysis of these environmentally threatening, high cost shale oil fields might be recognized if we follow this path.
Many economic commentators are failing to see the benefits of lower oil prices. Virtually all businesses will benefit from lower transportation costs by expanding their profit margins or passing the benefit to consumers at lower prices. The lower income groups, who spend a higher proportion of their incomes on transport, will see their disposable incomes rise, benefiting retailers who serve their needs and thereby increasing demand in the economy. Food prices are also likely to fall, as food production, processing and sales distribution are energy intensive activities, thereby benefiting lower income groups further. Increased consumption will stimulate aggregate demand, creating investment opportunities and economic growth. Governments in the west may also have the opportunity to increase fuel taxes to cover the real cost of the negative externalities of carbon emissions, or raise revenue to improve public transportation systems. Furthermore, governments in the Middle East and Asia will reduce spending on their fuel subsidies and may take the opportunity to improve the workings of market forces, which the IMF and Western powers have been seeking for them to do.
As many Western economies are seemingly slowing down again, with most of them still struggling with stubbornly high unemployment levels, they will only benefit from the current sharp drop in oil prices which will stimulate the global economy. Moreover, countries now have the opportunity to replenish stocks and protect themselves against future price hikes. Stockpiling begs the question: how long will prices remain relatively low compared to recent years? Will they fall further? $60 would certainly kick start substantial economic activity or will supply be rained back?
In the past, we have seen the US and its Western partners put pressure on OPEC, and the world's only swing producer Saudi Arabia, to increase supply so as to lower prices or maintain price stability. Are we about to see them create further price fixing market imperfections by asking the Saudis to cut production so as to create a return to higher prices? Much of the Western economic commentaries are suggesting the Middle East will fall apart as falling oil revenues will create unaffordable budget deficits, cuts in government spending, and political uprisings amongst their populations and ultimately scare Middle Eastern governments into considering cutting back on OPEC supply.
The recent period of high but stable oil prices has induced an economic recovery in the U.S. based on lower oil and energy prices, propped up Putin's government and economy which has become more heavily dependent upon its oil revenues, and increased the sovereign wealth funds of the GCC countries of the Middle East. Meanwhile, the rest of the world has suffered economic malaise consigning a generation to a life of unemployment and it appears that some commentators may want to maintain this status quo. Lower oil prices would likely benefit all via economic growth, and not just a few nations self-interests. This brings us to ask: have we been sacrificing economic efficiency for U.S. energy self-sufficiency?
If we can enjoy a period of sustained low oil prices where consumer disposable incomes rise and increase world aggregate demand, we may witness recovery in Europe and rising growth rates again in Asia. This would fuel economic activity at a time when a generation has been lost to unemployment, and maybe allow them to regain for a better future.   In this case oil prices will either recover, or rise in demand may equally bring about a rise in supply, ultimately increasing the revenues of oil produces.
Economic theory suggests that a lower price delivered by lowest cost producers is economically efficient. The lower prices will either force high cost producers out of the market or encourage them to seek lower cost technological solutions to stay in the market. The economic solution to our energy requirements is to invest in low cost producers instead of preventing them from reaching the market by financing chaos in the Middle East and Africa. Instead, supporting the development of low cost oil reserves in the Middle East and Africa would benefit these populations. The wealth created from oil revenues could be used to develop infrastructure, education, and health systems, rather than being frittered away by corruption and cronyism. However, this requires international oil and gas companies as well as the U.S. government to rethink their geopolitical strategies and adopt the capitalist model of economic efficiency, rather than supporting a model of imperfect competition and short term self-interest. As the world's largest open economy, the US would benefit more in the long run from encouraging world economic growth, rather than trying to protect its high oil price by fair means or foul.

How the Recession Is Still Hurting Millennialsreddit
Opportunity matters. But for many young Americans, opportunity is hard to come by.
Young Americans have faced bleak job prospects for years, but the recession hit millennials particularly hard. Just 63 percent of Americans age 20-24 were employed as of September 2014, according to calculations based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data. In September 2000, 73 percent of this population had work.
All this is in addition to the massive burden of student-loan debt. (Seven in 10 college seniors who graduated in 2012 had student-loan debt, and those with loans had an average debt of $29,400, according to The Project on Student Debt .)
Older Americans aren't facing the same financial struggles. Americans age 65 and older saw their median net worth grow from 2000-2011, rising to $170,516 in 2011 from $146,205 in 2000, according to a report from the U.S. Census Bureau. Median net worth for Americans younger than 35 dropped to $6,676 from $9,765 over the same time period.
All that hurt is not distributed evenly across the country. The numbers get worse when you focus on certain states. For instance, just 59.4 percent of Illinois residents age 20-24 are employed -- the worst rate in the Midwest.
Prospects are even worse for 16- to 19-year-olds in Illinois that want to gain work experience: just 26.3 percent of these young adults are employed.
Illinois' workforce has shrunk by 76,000 people over the last six months, and that's despite the fact that Illinois' working-age population is growing. During the Great Recession, 500,000 working-age adults either dropped out of the workforce or never entered it at all. At its current pace, Illinois is still seven years away from fully recovering from the recession.
This poses a vicious cycle for young people -- when there are fewer jobs, it's harder to find work; when you can't find work, you can't gain experience; when you have no experience, you're less likely to get hired.
Young people aren't just working to cover movie tickets and new clothes. Many need the money to help pay for school or their first apartment. They also need the experience that comes with entry-level work. Employment -- and the income that comes with it -- marks the ability to move from dependence to independence, and when there are fewer opportunities to make this leap, development is stunted.
According to a report from the Alternative Schools Network : "The loss of teen employment poses serious policy implications nationally and locally including significant adverse affects on future employability, earnings, family incomes, and ... serious fiscal burdens on the rest of society associated with lower lifetime earnings, lessened tax contributions and higher correctional costs."
The Center for American Progress estimated that:
A young person who has been unemployed for six months can expect to earn about 22,000 less over the next 10 years than they could have expected to earn had they not experienced a lengthy period of unemployment.
In April 2010, the number of people age 20-24 who were unemployed for more than six months had reached an all-time high of 967,000 people.
Young Americans will lose a total of 21.4 billion in earnings over the next 10 years.
It's no wonder nearly half of Americans don't think their children will be better off financially than they are.
Millennials aren't missing out on the recovery from the Great Recession because they don't want to work -- they're missing out because they're facing an economy that has too little to offer them.

Indian laws involve unique risks: Amazonelectronic commerce
Amazon is making the risk disclosure for the first time on India
Laws in India involve ‘unique risks’, and there are more uncertainties over the interpretation of these laws and regulations, Nasdaq-listed Amazon made this disclosure in its recent quarterly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Amazon, which commenced operations in India in June, 2013, is making the risk disclosure for the first time on India. It has been making a similar disclosure about China.
The disclosure comes amid reports that the Enforcement Directorate is looking into business models of e-commerce firms such as Amazon and Flipkart. India does not allow foreign direct investment in direct online retail, so Amazon has to operate as a market place. Rather than owning products, they host third-party merchants on their websites, from whom customers buy goods. According to reports, the ED is probing whether Amazon’s fully-owned Indian unit has been circumventing FDI norms. “For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to third-party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers. Although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws, they involve unique risks,” Amazon said in the quarterly filing. It also stated that it is possible that the government will ultimately take a view contrary to that of the company.
“In addition, our Chinese and Indian businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or in China enforce contractual relationships with respect to management and control of such businesses,” Amazon said. “If our international activities were found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC (the People’s Republic of China), Indian or other laws or regulations or if interpretations of those laws and regulations were to change, our businesses in those countries could be subject to fines and other financial penalties, have licences revoked, or be forced to shut down entirely.”
India has been the fastest country to hit $1 billion sales for Amazon, and the firm is investing $2 billion to up the ante against home-grown rival Flipkart.
“India has been covered as part of our international market segments in the risk factors section of our 10-Q, but this was the first time we called it out explicitly. Given our rapid growth and announcement of substantial investment, we called out India explicitly for the first time this quarter,” Amazon India spokeswoman said in an e-mail response.
Experts say the disclosures point to significant risks in e-commerce business in India, which has been in regulatory spotlight in recent times.
“E-commerce players like Amazon have created complex structures to comply with local laws. However, these structures have recently come under scrutiny of the regulators for potential violation of foreign direct investment (FDI) norms. In light of the above, Amazon may have felt the need to make the said disclosure and avoid concealment of material information,” said Zulfiqar Shivji, International Liaison Partner & Head — Transaction Advisory Services, BDO India LLP.
Ramesh Vaidyanathan, Managing Partner at Advaya Legal, said words ‘unique risks’ and ‘substantial uncertainties’ did raise serious concerns on whether Amazon’s belief that it was legally compliant was bonafide. “The disclosures appear vague insofar as they pertain to the Indian business of Amazon. However, given the sweeping nature of the disclaimer, it is possible that the Indian regulatory agencies seek clarifications on what is intended by the SEC filings. The timing of the disclosure also appears to hint at some contractual structures that may have been put in place recently”.

Hero Electric launches e-cyclesautomobile
Placing its bets on the growth of electric two-wheeler industry in the coming year, Hero Electric on Wednesday launched two new e-cycles Avior AFX and Avior AMX, prices at Rs 18,990 and Rs 19,290 (on-road Delhi), respectively.
The products will initially go on sale across the five meter cities and will be launched in tier 2 and tier 3 cities, gradually.
Talking to reporters, Hero Eco Group Managing Director Naveen Munjal said, “The product is primarily targeted largely towards working corporates, young professionals and the youth.”
He added the company is looking at sensitising a large urban population across all the metro cities to adopt these e-cycles as an alternate mode of transportation for commuting quick distance.
The products are primarily targeted at the young working class of the corporate houses, who love to reach their office from their nearby home in an eco-friendly way.”
The e-cycles are powered with 6 speed gears and maximum riding speed of 25 km/hr. It comes with alloy wheels and the maximum battery charge time is about 5-6 hours.
The electric vehicles market, Munjal said has shrunk to 25,000 units a year, from about 80,000 units two years back mainly due to factors such as withdrawal of government subsidies on electric vehicle, depreciation of rupee against the dollar and lack of network expansion.
However, he expressed hope that with the introduction on new policy on electric vehicle will give a much needed push to the sector.

P-Note investments climb to 3-month high at $36 billion in Septstocks
Investments into domestic shares through participatory notes (P-Notes) hit a three-month high of Rs 2.22 lakh crore (about USD 36 billion) in September.
P-Notes are mostly used by overseas HNIs (High Networth Individuals), hedge funds and other foreign institutions, to invest in Indian markets through registered Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs), while saving on time and costs associated with direct registration.
According to the data released by Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the total value of P-Note investments in Indian markets (equity, debt and derivatives) increased from Rs 2,11,499 crore in August to Rs 2,22,394 crore at the end of September.
This has reached highest level since June, when the cumulative value of such investments stood at Rs 2,24,248 crore.
Investment through P-Notes grew in September after declining for two successive months.
Besides, the value of P-Notes issued with derivatives as underlying, stood at Rs 1,02,224 crore at the end of last month.
The quantum of FII investments through P-Notes climbed to 10.7 per cent last month from 10.3 per cent in August.
Till a few years ago, P-Notes used to account for more than 50 per cent of the total FII investments, but their share has fallen after SEBI tightened the disclosure norms and other regulations for such investments.
P-Notes have been accounting for mostly 15-20 per cent of total FII holdings in India since 2009, while it used to be much higher — in the range of 25-40 per cent — in 2008. It was as high as over 50 per cent at the peak of Indian stock market bull run during a few months in 2007.
FIIs, the key drivers of Indian markets, pumped in a net amount of more than Rs 5,100 crore (USD 845 million) in the domestic equity market last month, while they poured in nearly Rs 16,000 crore (USD 2.6 billion) in the debt market in September.

Union Finance Minister concurs with the view the Congress had voiced after huge notional losses were projected in CAG reports on 2G and coal scams.
Close on the heels of senior Congress leader and Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee Chairman K.V. Thomas’ remark that the Comptroller and Auditor General should restrict audits to financial impropriety rather than putting out astronomical figures for notional losses, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley too asked the CAG to refrain from sensationalising its findings. An auditor has to be active, but activism and restraint are the two sides of the same coin, Mr. Jaitley said.
“Distinguish between wrong and corrupt decision”
Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday said an auditor should remain conscious of the fact that he was reviewing a decision that had already been taken and must check if fair procedures had been followed.
Mr. Jaitley was addressing the annual conference of the CAG.
“He has to scrutinise the decision making process thoroughly… necessarily eliminate the possibility of any form of nepotism.”
The Minister also said that an auditor must be able to distinguish between a wrong decision and a corrupt one — a stand the UPA government had taken at the time the CAG reports on 2G telecom spectrum allocation alleged its decision had caused notional losses of Rs. 1.76 lakh crore to the exchequer.
Referring to 2G spectrum and coal block allocations, Mr. Jaitley said the country had paid a very heavy price as the Supreme Court had cancelled those contracts.
“Both in the spectrum and coal cases, we have learnt that natural resources and their allotment are not the prerogative of the State to choose methodology... valuable resources cannot be allocated without value being realised,” he said.
The Modi government has announced it will conduct e-auctions for allocating the cancelled coal mines afresh.

Reading between the linesTweet
Business Line Watch your words! Guruji, a maker of fruit drink concentrates, is among the several brands that advertises safety messages on the Mumbai rail network. - SHASHI ASHIWAL
Public service advertising can get misinterpreted, if there is no strong connect between the message and the brand
It’s a public service campaign that could go by without attracting a second glance. But when an advertising professional was travelling by Mumbai’s suburban rail network on the Western Railway, the advertisement warning customers not to cross the tracks that got his attention.
The ad in question was a simple one that did not mince words and drove the point home. The problem, however, was with the brand that had associated itself with the cause. Guruji Products, an Indore-based maker of traditional Indian sharbats, thandais and fruit squash, was associated with the campaign.
When the word ‘squash’ screams out from the bottom of the ad, it’s not a nice image that comes to your mind after reading about the dangers associated with crossing the tracks. Another version of the ad even has the words ‘pulpy’ and ‘juicy’, the ad professional who did not want to be named told cat.a.lyst.
Other advertising professionals such as Dheeraj Sinha, chief strategy officer, South and South East Asia, Grey says, “Sometimes good intentions can be misread. The social cause has to tie in with the product delivery to have a larger meaning.” But cat.a.lyst decided to verify the opinions of ad practitioners with the average consumer. On the Western Railway when this writer asked a co-passenger about the Guruji Squash ad, the commuter dismissed it as just another ad. But a young college student had this to say, “We bought their juice concentrates even before these ads came into play. Their brand will only benefit from the number of passengers who travel by train everyday.” But Ramnath B, a passenger who travels from Malad to Churchgate, says, “Maybe, they could have advertised their delicious thandai instead. It could have steered clear of any words getting misinterpreted.” One thing is certain, Shree Guruji does certainly offer a lesson or two, beyond the railway safety that it set out to preach.

It’s not time to drop this medium just yet, says a study
Facebook or no? That’s the big question marketers are grappling with, especially when the social media platform has registered a decline in the number of new active users compared to last year. With Facebook’s changing algorithms and slowing organic reach companies might be inclined to shift their digital media budget to other channels, but is it the right time to do so? Think again.
Although Facebook’s reach has declined, user engagement is on the rise. People spend an average of 6.35 hours on Facebook each month, which is almost double the 3.20 hours they spend on Google, and three times more than 2.07 hours on Yahoo!, according to the Social Engagement Benchmark Report: Facebook by Salesforce.com's Marketing Cloud platform.
The report takes into account Facebook data from more than 2.4 million posts (published in 2013), combining both paid and organic. It indicates Facebook pages (of industry) are seeing a marked upturn in overall engagement, and that the sector that has benefited most from this engagement is media and entertainment.
For instance, Facebook engagement has been one of the key factors in the success of digital- and new-media company The Viral Fever–ONE (TVF-ONE) since its inception in 2010. “In the initial year of TVF's YouTube network, the only marketing activity we were doing was to share our releases on our Facebook page and nothing else,” says Arunabh Kumar, Founder & CEO of The Viral Fever & TVF Media Labs.
Some of the other sectors that enjoy a higher degree of engagement include the education and non-profit sectors, consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry, and retail and e-commerce.
The study states that for higher engagement levels on Facebook, relevance of the content is extremely important. It recommended that marketers post quality content at optimal times to reach those fans.
Content is king
To widen engagement on social media, the known e-commerce player Jabong.com has put in place a robust content strategy. “As an engagement initiative we focus on creating content that engages the audiences,” says Praveen Sinha, Co-founder and Managing Director. “The relevance of the content to users is very important and the onus is on the company to create that content.”
Jabong follows a multi-step process to create exclusive content. The e-retailing company houses a team of content experts that come up with relevant posts, articles, and pictures. The company also leverages its partners to engage the audiences.
The report recommends that e-commerce players should encourage the Facebook audience to share content with friends and leave comments, and Jabong has adopted various ways to do it.
“If you ask a question or look for the user’s point of view, the engagement happens much more where people comment, discuss and even share the post,” informs Sinha. “If there is a tip, the engagement will again be more but if it’s an article or an image there will be more Likes and fewer comments.” TVF is one of the few companies that does not spend on engagement through Facebook, and instead focuses on creating identifiable, and thus, shareable content. “To make sure we always have an organic reach and spread of content, we don’t intend to spend or budget for Facebook promotions,” says Kumar of TVF. “In fact even now, our core strategy for promoting content is to literally just share it on our Facebook and social media profiles and hope that our fans like it and share it as well.”
TVF has a limited fan base of about 3.87 lakh users but an extremely engaged one. The company's Facebook page has a strong fan following and audiences interact with the media house even through personal messages.
On the other hand, Jabong reserves a good share of its expenditure for digital marketing. “When it comes to marketing budget, Facebook shares almost the same amount of budget as Google does,” says Sinha.
“If our marketing spends are focused on branding and promotions it’s Facebook we spend on, but if the spends are meant for performance marketing, the larger share of money goes to Google.” Jabong has around 31.24 lakh Likes (at the time of writing) on its Facebook page.
Need to know
The study gives other interesting insights on the way Facebook engagement works.
For instance, the education and non-profit sector posts content most frequently on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, but receives the most Likes and comments on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.
For the CPG industry the overall engagement is strong every day. The overall Facebook audience base for CPG has grown 55 per cent in 2013.
Also, the sectors with less/weak Facebook engagement are financial services, and technology and manufacturing.
The study also reveals users are most engaged with Facebook content on weekends — which also happens to be the days when marketers post less content.

eBay is creating a space for itselfeBay is creating a space for itself

The American e-commerce major is not as vocal as its peers, but it has tasted success in India
This Diwali, e-commerce companies made all the noise, enticing consumers with deep discounts and freebies. Flipkart, Snapdeal, Amazon and rest of the pack were all over the media with their advertisements and campaigns. While Flipkart’s much hyped ‘Big Billion Day’ sale bombed, rivals Snapdeal and Amazon made the most of it through their marketing campaigns. It didn’t matter that their retail cousins complained that e-commerce was undercutting prices and destroying the brick-and-mortar business.
Amidst this, eBay India was conspicuous by its absence. And unlike its peers, the company was making friends with the retail industry. In July, the American e-commerce giant signed an agreement with the Confederation of All India Traders, an apex body representing the trading community in India. The deal aimed at enabling “Indian traders to use eBay as a platform for retail exports”.
But this news aside, it seemed there was nothing else to write about eBay in India. It was among the early birds in the Indian e-commerce industry, entering the market in 2005 by acquiring Baazee.com. But since then, it seemed to have failed to connect with consumers.
In comparison its American peer Amazon came in only in 2013 but critics say that the Jeff Bezos-company has won the eye-ball war. So, is eBay losing out in the Indian e-commerce battle? The e-commerce industry is in a high-growth phase with players fighting for a larger pie in the $3.5-billion market, which, according to a Crisil report, is set to grow to $70 billion by 2020.
But Latif Nathani, Managing Director, eBay India, told BusinessLine that the company is not in any race for the number one position. “We have been at the forefront, pioneering commerce in India since the last nine years, and have established strong brand equity, large and loyal user base, a strong global technology platform and continue to strengthen our position in the market,” he said. Taking a swipe at his local peers, he added: “We believe in inclusive growth, where the market can evolve taking both online and offline retailers together.”
A different model
The company has had its share of success. It is India’s largest online marketplace with over 35,000 listed sellers. Amazon has over 10,000 and Flipkart and Snapdeal each have less than 5,000 sellers. On an average day, while eBay India sells 18 products a minute, Flipkart clocks 20. Nathani added that eBay India has over 30 million products listed across 2,000 categories. It is followed by Amazon, which has over 18 million products.
Like its parent company, eBay India has a marketplace model, wherein a consumer sells to another on its platform directly. The goods traded are mostly pre-owned. In the US, pre-owned products form a major part of the sales, helping eBay Inc’s revenues grow two-fold in four years, from $8.7 billion in 2009 to $16 billion in 2013. In India, it initially gained popularity but could not hold on to its consumers for long. Nathani declined to share financial information on the India unit.
Ashish Jhalani, founder of consultancy firm e-Tailing India, says: “For years eBay followed their US strategy, which did not account for nuances in India. It is now adapting to the needs of Indian e-commerce and is seeing better traction.” So now, says Jhalani, eBay India is focusing on exports. “This has been leading to their growth lately,” he added.
The 15,000 exporters listed on eBay are benefiting. About 36 per cent of them saw 20 per cent growth and over 30 per cent grew by anywhere between 21 and 40 per cent, the company claims. More than 50 per cent of eBay’s sales comes from exports, something no other e-commerce player in the country can boast of.
“Indian merchants have potential to be one of the largest retail exporters and we are helping boost the trade,” says Nathani. But with competitors vying to snare customers, eBay has to be careful.  "To prevent leakage of consumers to peers, eBay India needs consumer retention strategies using the big data it already owns,” says Srikanth Chunduri, Co-founder & COO, eMart Solutions, a loyalty and consumer engagement company. eBay didn’t disclose its customer base. The company will also have to match the marketing chutzpah of its competitors to protect its customer base.
However, it has been aggressive on the deal counter. Last year, eBay picked up a stake in Snapdeal for an undisclosed amount and might participate in another round of fund-raising in the Indian company. Says Nathani: “Our partnership with Snapdeal seeks to drive more consumer demand for eBay and Snapdeal merchants along with a wider selection for consumers.” Critics, however, believe that eBay could end up acquiring Snapdeal. Surely then, eBay is very much in contention in the e-commerce war.

Valuation of e-companies keeps hitting a new high as everyone searches for India's Alibaba
Do you feel that e-commerce companies are attracting valuations that are not justified? Well, you may be missing the woods for the trees, is the expert view.
The valuation may seem sky high if one applies conventional metrics such as price-to-earnings, price-to-sales or even new-age ones such as visitors and repeat customers. Take the case of Make My Trip, which is listed on Nasdaq; the company is yet to make profits, but its market capitalisation of $2 billion is “larger than that of all the major airlines in India put together,” observes N Muthuraman, Director, RiverBridge Investment Advisors.
While valuation is a “judgement” call, it is driven by the perceived exit opportunities for e-commerce companies. And for those with a long investment horizon, there seems to be enough reason to be bullish on online sales.
Large headroom
The optimism is topped by the e-commerce industry’s growth potential. Sample this: China’s web sales, according to research firm EMarketer, stood at $133 billion in 2013. The Indian market is currently around $3.5 billion, according to Gartner.  And this is estimated to be less than 1 per cent of the country’s overall retail market of $500 billion.
The number of customers also has room for growth. “There are only 15-20 million online shoppers currently, compared with a near-term potential of 150 million,” notes Rama Bethmangalkar, Principal, Ventureast. The vast market, with potential for 50-100 per cent annual growth in the next few years, is a factor that is boosting valuations.
Rapid growth is also why Chinese major Alibaba is valued higher than Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce company by revenue. Amazon’s sales are projected to increase by 20 per cent while Alibaba’s are likely to grow by 33 per cent in the coming year, according to Bloomberg.
So, while Amazon, which clocked $74.5 billion revenue in 2013, has a market capitalisation of $144 billion, Alibaba, with $8.6 billion revenue for the year ended March 2014, listed with a market capitalisation of $168 billion. In comparison, India’s largest e-commerce company Flipkart, with revenue of around $250 million in 2012-13, was valued at $7 billion in July 2014.
Enabling growth
“Unlike the US and China, the Indian market is heterogeneous,” says Bethmangalkar. So, companies that “embrace” the differences in customer needs and offer differentiation in their product will be valued higher.
One aspect to consider is how well companies can widen their customer base by shifting offline shoppers online. While a few factors such as broadband penetration and mobile internet are already happening, others such as ease of payment are still in-the-works. Muthuraman says that the sharp price differential between online and offline stores could lead to wider use of credit card and debit card payments. “If a sizeable number of people become comfortable with making online purchases, the e-commerce market will take off in a big way”, he says. Bethmangalkar says that apart from cash-on-delivery, financing options will aid further growth. For instance, onemi.in helps buyers to get instant credit for their purchases.
But customers who are attracted by coupons and easy payments may not be “sticky” and could switch loyalties. So, holding on to clients requires giving them a good shopping experience. Here is where technology can be a “key differentiator”, says Chinnu Senthilkumar, Partner and CTO of Exfinity Technology Fund. He suggests that besides metrics such as customer reach and sales, operational efficiencies and content experience must also be factored in when valuing e-commerce portals. The reason is that shoppers need help in choosing the right product. One way to do this is to offer expert advice on style, trends and product reviews. Another way is to reduce hassles such as product return. He gives the example of finding a shoe that goes with the clothing, which also fits well. Typically, there are lots of shoe returns and companies such as findmeashoe.com are tackling this tricky issue, he says.

Top MBA programmes are talent screening mechanismsStory
A Passport to Success
A professional course like MBA has two major objectives - acquiring business education and skills during the two-year programme, and acquiring that dream job at the end of the programme.
Shailesh Pathak        Edition: Oct 26, 2014
Shailesh Pathak
Top Indian MBA programmes, like other top-notch qualifications, are, in effect, talent screening mechanisms. Since only the top one per cent of applicants make it there, recruiters are assured of a minimum level of quality. For those aspiring to a career in business, admission into one of the top 20 MBA programmes is indeed a passport to success. This is true for those graduating from the IITs, AIIMS, SRCC, the National Law Schools and others, where admissions are very difficult.
Indian MBA schools take in students at younger ages of 21 to 24, with little or no work experience. American top-ranked programmes have older students with more work experience, with an average age of 26 to 29. The first two IIMs in the country, IIM Calcutta and IIM Ahmedabad, had 70 per cent students with less than two years of experience in the 2013 class. Here, recruiters have little by way of track record to differentiate among applicants. They, therefore, rely more on the initial talent filtering offered by these MBA institutes.
A professional course like MBA has two major objectives-acquiring business education and skills during the two-year programme, and acquiring that dream job at the end of the programme. Usually, the second is more important to most students, who see this as return on investment in the MBA. For evaluating MBA rankings, placement is a very important criteria for both recruiters and students. The BT rankings have other criteria as well, including learning experience and future orientation. These would perhaps not be as important as placement. This was underscored to me during a recent meeting of a top MBA programme's advisory body.
FULL COVERAGE: India's Best B-Schools 2014
As far as learning during the two-year programme goes, most top MBA graduates, five years into their careers, would perhaps agree that while their academic inputs were stimulating, their learning outside classrooms, especially from fellow students, was equally significant. Most of us would say such learning from a diverse set of peers and students was even more educative. At the middle- and top-management levels, the alumni network of the institute is an asset for most MBAs. Here, US schools have much that Indian B-schools can learn from, including organising an annual business event where big hitters from industry are invited. A Wharton or Harvard is actually easier to get into than the IIMs, but their alumni networks and global reach is far more effective.
Academic inputs do provide a framework for actions in the corporate world. There are indeed outstanding teachers who are 'rock stars', challenging minds and providing great learning experiences. But for the most part, freshly minted Indian MBAs need further training in a corporate environment. I have been part of a private equity fund that believed in hiring MBAs only after they'd acquired two years of post-MBA experience.
There is also a need for more life skills among fresh MBAs, who seem to value only the technical and subject-matter courses offered as electives. At our silver jubilee reunion, an IIM director agreed that more soft skills are needed at all career stages, including the first five years. However, there was little inclination among students to opt for such 'softer' electives. One would strongly recommend the top MBA schools getting their alumni to deliver guest lectures on the importance of such life skills, in an era where teamwork and collegial skills are much more important than working with screens alone, whether computer or smartphone.
For MBA aspirants, therefore, if you have less than two years of work experience, go through the talent screening mechanism and get to a top Indian MBA programme. If you've been working longer than three years, try getting into a global top MBA, much easier to make it there. Either way, enjoy your two-year stint on the campus!

BJP leader Thakur invites CM Manjhi to join  Dalit-friendly  BJPBihar Chief Minister Jeetan Ram Manjhi
Written by Santosh Singh | Patna | Posted: October 30, 2014 11:35 am | Updated: October 30, 2014 11:38 am
BJP national vice president and former Union minister CP Thakur on Thursday invited Bihar Chief Minister Jeetan Ram Manjhi to join “Dalit-friendly” BJP. Thakur, who is known for his frankness, said since Manjhi had been “ feeling suffocated and are not able to take his decisions “, he should quit JD (U) and join BJP.
Speaking to reporters at Patna this morning, former BJP state president Thakur said: “Recent statements of Manjhi show that he feels suffocated in JD (U) and is not allowed to follow his mind. We invite him to join BJP that respects Dalits and talks about their rights and welfare.”
Thakur said though Manjhi was made Chief Minister, he had “not been given full power to exercise his authority as the CM”. “BJP is as much party of Dalits. Manjhi is most welcome”, he said. Manjhi had said at a Gaya function recently that “though he was the CM, he was afraid of taking tough decision for fear of scrutiny”. HRD minister Brishen Patel, however, said Manjhi had been very much “taking his own decisions and his Gaya statements were made in a different context”.
With former CM Nitish Kumar all set to embark on Sampark Yatra from 13 November to “reinstate his position as supreme JD (U) leader”, Manjhi has been trying to position himself as a Dalit leader.

Uma Bharati to inspect tomorrow 25 drains falling intoGangaPrint
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 30, 2014 7:01 pm
As part of the Clean Ganga campaign, Union Water Resources Minister Uma Bharati would inspect 25 major drains, which fall into the river at Kanpur on Friday.
Bharati’s visit comes against the backdrop of her warning to industries on the banks of the river and its tributaries that are violating pollution norms.
She will inspect 25 major drains, which fall into the Ganga and will have discussions with local officials, a press release here said while adding that the Minister will be accompanied by a team of experts.
Addressing a national dialogue on industrial pollution in the Ganga on October 8, she had said that priority would be given for saving the river.
“If I am asked (by a doctor) whether a mother or her baby should be saved during delivery, I would say both. But when a situation is arising where only one among them could be saved, then I would say the mother should be saved,” she had said in an apparent reference to the Ganga as the mother.
On the other hand, it may also be recalled that the Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the National Green Tribunal to take action against industrial units polluting the Ganga including snapping water and power connections to them. It also slammed the Centre and state pollution control boards for their “failure” to punish erring units.

Microsoft Corp launched a device called “Microsoft Band” that will allow users to monitor their fitness and exercise regime, marking the world’s largest software company’s debut into the wearable technology market.
The wrist-worn device has sensors that monitor pulse rate, measure calorie burn and track sleep quality, Microsoft said in a blog post.
Microsoft said the device will be available in the United States in limited quantities from Thursday for $199.
Apple Inc unveiled a smart watch on Sept. 9 that will combine health and fitness tracking with communications and will go on sale in early 2015, while Samsung Electronics Co  unveiled its Galaxy Gear smart watch in September 2013. The Apple Watch will be priced at $349.
Microsoft also launched a health app called “Microsoft Health” that includes a cloud service for users to store and combine health and fitness data.
The Microsoft Health app will collect data from the fitness band and will work on iPhones and Android smartphones, as well as its own Windows Phone.

Assembly polls: J-K police launches crackdown against separatists after boycottcallPrint
Written by Ruwa Shah | Srinagar | Posted: October 30, 2014 6:54 pm
Ahead of the Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir, police have started a spree of arrests against the separatists. From past two days, senior separatist leaders, Nayeem Khan, Shabir Ahmad Shah, Ayaz Akbar and JKLF Chairman Yasin Malik have been detained by the police.
The crackdowns on the separatist leaders have been launched as they have given a call for poll boycott. The assembly elections will be held in the state in five phases and separatist leaders have decided to launch anti-poll campaign across the state.
In the last two days, teams of J&K Police have raided the residences of all Hurriyat members and detained 10 activists associated with Hurriyat Conference led by Syed Ali Geelani.
The police have also detained leaders and activists of various separatist organizations in many districts. Sources said that more arrests would be made in the coming days.
Terming the arrests and the conduct of elections as “inhumane”, hard-line separatist leader Syed Ali Geelani said that it is an anti-people move by the state.
“The conduct of election in the time when people need to be rehabilitated is an inhuman approach. All the relief operations that are important in these times will be hampered by this step,” he said.
Geelani said the state is keeping the administration busy in the election process so as to stop the relief distribution work in the flood-hit state. “Conducting election this time will only make people suffer more,” he said.
Meanwhile, following the arrest of Malik clashes between police and supporters of JKLF broke out in Maisuma locality.

Being gay is among the greatest gifts God has given me: Apple CEO TimCookCook wrote in the column, published Thursday, that it wasn't an easy choice to publicly disclose that he is gay.
By: AP | New York | Posted: October 30, 2014 7:35 pm | Updated: October 31, 2014 10:42 am
The public declaration, in an essay written for Bloomberg Businessweek, makes Tim Cook the highest-profile business CEO to come out as gay.
Cook said that while he never denied his sexuality, he never publicly acknowledged it, either. The executive said that for years he’s been open with many people about his sexual orientation and that plenty of his Apple colleagues know he is gay.
Cook wrote in the column, published Thursday, that it wasn’t an easy choice to publicly disclose that he is gay, but that he felt the acknowledgment could help others.
“I’ve come to realize that my desire for personal privacy has been holding me back from doing something more important,” he wrote.
Alabama is among the states that do not recognize same-sex marriage, and it also doesn’t offer legal protections on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Cook is a native of Robertsdale, Alabama, and attended Auburn University.
The announcement is a “huge deal,” said Richard Metheny of executive search firm Witt/Kieffer.
“This really sets the stage for `It’s OK,”’ he said. “Anything CEOs do is very magnified, very complicated, and it affects a lot of people. … There’s no taking away that he has become a role model and will have a positive influence on lots of people that would like to be comfortable being out in the world of business.”
“I consider being gay among the greatest gifts God has given me,” Cook wrote in the essay Thursday. The executive said that “being gay has given me a deeper understanding of what it means to be in the minority and provided a window into the challenges that people in other minority groups deal with every day.”
Cook said he’s been lucky to work for a company that “loves creativity and innovation and knows it can only flourish when you embrace people’s differences.” Cook, 53, succeeded Apple founder Steve Jobs as CEO of Apple Inc. in 2011.
Apple Inc. has been an outspoken champion for diversity since Cook succeeded Jobs as CEO. The company has trumpeted the phrase, “Inclusion inspires innovation,” as a rallying cry. Cook has reinforced that message on his Twitter account with periodic posts supporting gay rights in the workplace.
Cook’s public declaration that he is gay comes a little more than two months after Robert Hanson, the former CEO of American Eagle Outfitters Inc, wrote a piece for Time in which he talked about being an openly gay man for as long as he’s been in business and running companies. Hanson is currently the CEO of luxury jewelry brand John Hardy.

Pakistan to evacuate 50 000 people in wake of NilofarcyclonePrint

Pakistan has planned to evacuate at least 50,000 people from its southern coastal areas with cyclone Nilofar slowly moving towards it, officials said on Thursday.
The cyclone, moving at about 14km per hour speed towards Sindh may hit Pakistan Thursday night or Friday with the possibility of heavy rains in the lower parts of the province over the next two days.
Chief meteorologies Tauseef Alam told reporters in Karachi that the cyclone may pass around 250km from Karachi but its outer waves will hit the coast.
The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has said that about 50,000 people in vulnerable areas are to be ready for emergency evacuation.
All government offices and educational institutions in Karachi, Thatta, Badin, Sujawal and Tharparkar will remain closed on Friday where a cyclone emergency had been declared.
Preparations have been made to rehabilitate people in government buildings including educational institutions.
Provincial Information Minister Sherjeel Memon said emergency centres have been set up in all coastal areas and appeals were being made to residents of the areas to shift for a few days to safe locations within their districts.
The government has already asked the fishermen to stay away from the sea and those already gone to the sea were being called back.
Apart from Sindh, emergency has been imposed in coastal area of Balochistan province.
Chief Minister Dr Abdul Malik Baloch said his government had taken measures to avoid losses.
Pakistan experts said the cyclone will further weaken as it moves towards coastal areas of lower Sindh.
At present the estimated central pressure of cyclone is 996hpa and the average sustained wind speed is around 90-100 knots.
The cyclone will start weakening Thursday afternoon and is likely to hit Sindh as a cyclonic storm or depression with a wind speed of 70-80km per hour.

Death sentence for Indian fishermen: Rameswaram tense as fishing community takes tostreetsPrint
Written by Durgesh Haridas | New Delhi/rameswaram | Posted: October 30, 2014 7:31 pm | Updated: October 30, 2014 9:10 pm
Five Indian fishermen hailing from the coastal village of Thangachimadam in Rameswaram of Ramanathapuram district were handed the death penalty by a Sri Lankan court on Thursday.
The convicted Indians — Emerson, Prasath, Agustus, Wilson and Lancget — all hail from Thangachimadam, the central region of Rameswaram island. It is the first time Indian fishermen captured by the Sri Lanka Navy have been sentenced to death by the Island nation.
The five Indians are among a group of eight people sentenced to death by the High Court in Colombo. They were arrested in the seas near northern Jaffna in 2011.
The High Court judge Preethi Padman Surasena sentenced the three Sri Lankans and five Indian fishermen for their involvement in heroin trafficking between the two countries. The court, however, has given until November 16 for filing appeals.
Arrest of Indian Tamil fishermen off the south eastern coast of India is not an uncommon feature, most of them are arrested for trespassing International Maritime Borderline (IMBL).
Fishing Community Reacts
The fishing community in Rameswaram town and surrounding villages of Thangachimadam, Pamban and Rameswaram are deeply hurt and have taken to the streets to show their support.
The village falls on the arterial Madurai- Rameshwaram state highway which also connects the Island to the mainland via the famous Pamban bridge. The road has been blocked by barks of palm trees that have been set on fire by angry protesters. A state transport bus has also been set on fire.
“The situation is becoming tense here,fishermen have not gone out to fish, they are planning a rail roko and have already blocked the main road in Thangachimadam” IJA Newton, a Rameswaram resident who operates a travel agency, told IndianExpress.com.
“Fishermen leaders are planning a meeting and will decide further action after that,” said M Thillaibagyam, a former CPM member and activist from Rameswaram.
Unconfirmed reports claim protesters have occupied the railway track at Thangachimadam owing to which all express trains to Chennai and Tuticorin have been temporarily cancelled.
All political parties in Tamil Nadu have condemned the Lankan court’s decision and have appealed to the Central government to intervene.
“To put such a blatant false case on poor fishermen is totally unacceptable. The Centre must take all steps to see that these innocent fishermen are released,” said Tamilisai Soundararajan, Tamil Nadu BJP president, in an interview to a television channel.
Senior DMK leader TKS Elangovan also condemned the sentencing and said the case should have been handled better and the fishermen should be given all assistance by the Modi government. Tamil Nadu Congress president B S Gnanadesikan also reacted and said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should intervene and see that the innocent fishermen are released.
Other state political leaders including CPM state leader G.Ramakrishnan, PMK head S Ramadoss expressed their concerns and urged the central government to take up the issue with utmost seriousness.
Spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs Syed Akbaruddin said: “We are confident that in a court of law their innocence will be proved.” He assured that continued…

Modi to be star attraction at Devendra Fadnavis grandswearing-inApart from PM Modi, 8 Chief Ministers, 6 Union Ministers and top celebrities are likely to attend the ceremony.

While swearing-in ceremonies for chief ministers are normally official occasions involving a lot of protocol, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is leaving no stone unturned to turn the coronation ceremony of its first chief minister in Maharashtra a grand event high on symbolism and glitz.
Departing from protocol, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the event’s star attraction, will be seated on a special dais erected on the left of the main dais, where CM-designate Devendra Fadnavis and his cabinet will be sworn in by Governor CH Vidyasagar Rao. The Prime Minister had also attended the swearing-in of Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar.
Besides Modi, at least six Union Cabinet Ministers including Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari, Minister for Chemical and Fertilisers Ananth Kumar, Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javdekar, and Consumer Affairs and Food and Public Distribution minister of state Raosaheb Danve will attend the oath-taking ceremony at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium.
BJP national president Amit Shah, party’s general secretaries JP Nadda and Rajiv Pratap Rudy, Chief Minister of BJP-ruled states – Manohar Parrikar (Goa), Shivraj Chouhan (Madhya Pradesh), Anandiben Patel (Gujarat), Raman Singh (Chattisgarh), and Vasundhara Raje (Rajasthan), will add to the event’s star power.
According to information, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu (Telugu Desam Party), and Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal (Shiromani Akali Dal) are also expected to be present at the event.
At the time of filing this report, the state’s protocol department was yet to get a confirmation from the BJP regarding the attendance of BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani. But, BJP sources said that the party veteran, who had remained present for Khattar’s swearing in, is expected to attend the ceremony.
Giving a touch of glamour to the event, the BJP has sent invites to who’s who in Bollywood. Top corporates and leading sportspersons from Maharashtra are expected to remain present too.
As reported first by The Indian Express, the event will be a break from tradition with a cultural show by renowned artist Ashok Hande preceding the official swearing-in ceremony. For more saffron flavour, 25 fishing boats will be bobbing along the Arabian Sea just off Wankhede Stadium, with a giant cut off of a lotus at the centre and BJP flags on the deck.
The BJP has roped in popular Bollywood set designer Nitin Desai and event organiser Ravi Savla for the planning, design and construction of the stages, barricades and for the decor at the event.
Protocol issues
Though the swearing-in has its own protocol, Maharashtra protocol department and Raj Bhavan officials will have to deal with extra-ordinary protocol issues as well. While the Governor normally enjoys top most protocol for such event, Prime Minister and the Union Home Minister enjoy higher protocol.
New Cabinet to meet after swearing-in
Immediately after the swearing-in, CM-designate Devendra Fadnavis will hold a cabinet meeting, where a resolution to hold a three-day special session of the state legislature beginning November 4 will be formalised. The BJP government will take the floor test in the state assembly on November 6. Fadnavis will hold an interaction with the press, where he is expected to announce his agenda for Maharashtra.
Symbolism
Before his oath taking, Fadnavis is expected to pay homage to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s statue in Mumbai’s Worli. The BJP is expected to invoke Maratha warrior king Chhatrapati Shivaji at the ceremony itself. Immediately after the swearing-in, Fadnavis and his newly sworn in cabinet team will garland the Shivaji statue near Mantralaya.

Crop Care Federation questions NPOF dataCrop Care Federation questions NPOF data

New Delhi, Oct. 30:  
After taking on foreign-funded NGOs, the Crop Care Federation of India (CCFI) now has its sights set on the Indian Government. In a letter sent to the Prime Minister’s Office dated October 27, CCFI has sought an investigation into the National Project on Organic Farming (NPOF) citing data fraud in project reports, particularly in the numbers from Delhi and Orissa.
Attributing its findings to NPOF annual reports, CCFI questioned the exponential increase in the area under organic farming coverage in the Capital region. From 266 hectares (ha) in 2010-11, it covered 1,00,239 ha the following year but production dropped from 2,172 tonnes to 0.01 tonnes. The missive further states, “According to NPOF data, Delhi produced 4,765 tons of organic products in the financial year 2009 and the state of Assam produced 2,329 tons… urban Delhi’s output of organic products was 100% higher than that of Assam… how to understand all these?”
With regard to Orissa, CCFI doubted the “disconnect between area and production”. In the numbers from the NPOF report that the body cites, production numbers increased from 62,392 tonnes in 2009 to 29.01 million tonnes (mt) in 2011 while the area under organic coverage reduced from 92,452 ha to 43,868 ha over the same period. The letter alleges that the surge in Orissa’s production numbers was reflected in India’s total organic production to 29.6 mt in 2011 from 3.88 mt the previous year.
WILD VARIATION
“This kind of wild variation of data did not raise the eyebrows of the senior officials. Shocking. Was there any auditing done?” states the letter, a copy of which is with Business Line, which also alleged that NPOF and the Agriculture and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) had engaged in “data suppression”.
“APEDA website claims that soybeans and soy meal accounted for 70% of the total organic commodities exported (1.94 lakh tons) from India in the year 2013-14… our preliminary investigations reveal that the quantum of soy based animal feed exported as “organic” is much more than what is organically produced and/or certified in India,” the letter reads.
Signed by CCFI Chairman Rajju Shroff, the letter recommended a forensic audit into NPOF/APEDA “to fully understand the depth of data fraud in implementing organic farm projects” and sought “civil and criminal action besides administrative action against those found guilty”.
The NPOF is a Central Sector Scheme since the 10th Five Year Plan and began operations with an outlay of Rs. 57.04 crore in October 2004. The scheme was continued in the 11th plan with an outlay of Rs. 101 crore. Implementation of NPOF strategies are managed by an Organic Farming Cell located in Ghaziabad with six regional centres.

BP to work with govt on ‘premium’ prices for natural gas
M Ramesh
Chennai, October 30:  
 
The British oil major, BP, has said it would “work with the new Indian government” on the ‘premium’ prices that the government has promised for natural gas produced from future discoveries in tough areas.
On October 18, the Government of India came up with a new formula for gas pricing, effectively raising the price at which gas could be sold by about $ 2 per MMBTU. In the statement of that day, it said, “For all discoveries after this decision, in Ultra Deep Water Areas, Deep Water Areas and High Pressure-High Temperature areas, a premium would be given on the gas price to be determined as per the prescribed procedure.” 
In a conference call with investors, BP’s Chief Financial Officer, Brian Gilvary, said on Wednesday that there is “uncertainty around what those premiums would look like”.
BP is a partner of Reliance Industries in the D6 gas field in the Krishna-Godavari basin of Bay of Bengal, off Andhra Pradesh coast. Terming the region as “a terrific resource”, Mr Gilvary said that the development of the resource is crucial to the growth of Indian gas. “The question mark going forward is more around actually understanding what the various statements meant around premiums associated with new discoveries and how they will actually pan out going forward,” he said, answering an analyst’s question.
“We’ve taken some pretty conservative assumptions around what we believe the premium would look like but there is so much uncertainty around that it's impossible to say at this point,” he said, citing the uncertainty as the backdrop to the write-off of $ 770 million from the value of its investments in the D6 block.
In the earnings press release the company issued on Wednesday, it said that the $ 770 million “arises as a result of uncertainty in the future long-term gas price outlook, following the introduction of a new formula for Indian gas prices, although we do see the commencement of a transition to market-based pricing as a step in the right direction.
Going by the formula, BP has assumed it would get a price of $ 6.7 MMBTU, compared with $ 4.2 earlier.

PTI All Principal Chief Commissioners and Chief Commissioners of IT departments in the country have been asked by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to assemble for the meeting in the national capital on Wednesday.
TOPICS
taxes and duties
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will hold a high-level review-cum-strategy meeting of top Income Tax commissioners on Thursday to bolster revenue collection work and chart a roadmap to achieve the target.
All Principal Chief Commissioners and Chief Commissioners of IT departments in the country have been asked by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to assemble for the meeting in the national capital on Wednesday, a senior IT official said.
The CBDT has also asked these officers to update and prepare latest reports about the status of tax collections in their respective regions before the meeting. Among host of issues that pose a challenge to the revenue collection, official said, the FM would review the shortage of tax collection under Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) category.
CBDT Chairman K.V. Chowdary, gauging the importance of the subject, on Tuesday held a video conference session with the top IT officers asking them to pull up their socks and ensure a larger chunk of revenue under this category. Officials, citing a CBDT data, said while during the same period last year TDS collections stood at 14.5 per cent, this year it was lagging behind at 9.3 per cent.
“The high level meeting on Thursday will discuss threadbare about these issues which are posing a challenge to the revenue work. The CBDT has asked all cadre controlling chief commissioners to prepare the latest data of tax collection in their regions which should be updated till October 20 and this would be presented to the FM,” the officer said.
The meeting is not only expected to review the job done till now but also to strategise steps that would bolster these efforts, he added.

Risk management: Statistical methods vs neural networksIn today’s market, application of models based on neural networks might be more appropriate
October 29, 2014:  
Risk management is an important function in institutions having a direct exposure to commodity markets.
Numerous tools have been developed so far but time and again we see that these tools fail to capture the tail event that the institution cared about the most.
There could be many reasons why such events are not captured by the existing risk management frameworks in the most sophisticated institutions.
In my opinion, there could be a couple of reasons.
First, people’s misinterpretation of risk gives birth to irrational risk management tools. Second, risk management tools are outdated causing end-users of these tools to make irrational decisions. It is time that risk management, technology and markets are aligned to enable faster and efficient decision-making.
Consider an example of an asset such as soyameal which in the last week has troubled more people than one would have expected. There were many reasons for the sudden rally but the key question is: were the models existent to pick up the cues from the market and dynamically adjust the risk?
Traditional models are mostly statistical, and this has a fair number of limitations. These statistical models are used primarily because of established technology and understanding by risk managers.
Risk managers in banks and trade houses, in my opinion, would little understand any other methodology giving rise to a limitation in the measurement of risk.
Thus, traditional statistical models would have failed to capture the risk in the volatile market witnessed last week.
In today’s markets, application of models based on neural networks might be more appropriate, especially, in this particular case of soyameal.
Neural networks are useful when there is high degree of complexity in behaviour, unknown behaviour between the independent and dependent variables, and a lot of noise in the data.
In addition, when this is combined with the technological prowess of the data science tools available, the risk management can be more effective.
The key question is: do neural networks or statistical models offer the best predictive power in soyameal risk measurement?
In my opinion, the neural networks will offer the better solution but do not take it for granted as one can easily perform a test to compare two models on the same data set to come to a conclusion.
What set me thinking on this course was that a fair number of agriculture players were short on liquid soyameal contract against non-liquid protein inventories.
A sudden rally in the market caused the risk to dislocate, and most of these traditional players used statistical models to capture such risk that failed.
To blame the market is not a solution, to find a risk management tool to adapt to the market is definitely a desired solution.

Britains dangerous gambleThe Continent of Great Britain Or so Cameron would have us believe ANTON BALAZH/SHUTTERSTOCK.COM
Cameron’s confrontationist approach towards the EU could muddy the waters for Indian businesses in the UK
In January last year, British Prime Minister David Cameron delivered a speech on the EU that he hoped would appease the conflicting factions within his party — those that saw Europe as essential to Britain’s long-term prosperity and those that viewed it as the albatross around the nation’s neck, holding it back with red tape and restraints.
Pledging a referendum on the UK’s membership of the EU by the end of 2017 after negotiating the return of some of the country’s powers to the national parliament, he said he would fight with all his “heart and soul” to remain in the EU. “Britain’s national interest is best served in a flexible, adaptable and open European Union,” he concluded, pointing to countries such as Norway and Switzerland that had to negotiate access to the market “sector by sector”.
The combination of offering a referendum while at the same time appearing to stand strong on Britain’s interests would enable him to satisfy both wings of the party in a way that neither Margaret Thatcher nor the last Conservative prime minister John Major had been able to. Undoubtedly, he also had in mind former Labour prime minister Harold Wilson’s success in the mid-1970s of, first, successfully renegotiating some of the terms of Britain’s entry o the European Economic Community and then holding a referendum on EU membership in which over two-thirds supported remaining in the union.
Wind forward 21 months, and it’s a very different picture. Cameron’s gamble back in 2013 is backfiring, with the political debate in the country firmly swinging against EU membership, forcing the prime minister into an increasingly anti-European stance. Just last month, following Scotland’s vote against independence Cameron pronounced on the BBC that he felt “a thousand times more strongly” about the United Kingdom than the European Union.
Changed scenario
Recent speeches have dwelt little on the pros of EU membership and much on its perceived problems. In October, David Cameron insisted that only British people were his “boss” following criticism from the outgoing European Commission president, insisting their concerns were not unreasonable. “They want this issue fixed, they are not being unreasonable about it, and I will fix it,” he said.
There have been a large number of factors at work of course, but the biggest one is undoubtedly the anti-immigration, anti-EU UK Independence Party. Like other rightwing parties it made strong gains in the EU parliamentary elections over the summer, winning just over 28 per cent of the vote in Britain, with its support base concentrated in areas of high unemployment outside the capital.
The party recently got its first Westminster parliamentary seat after a former Conservative MP beat his old party in a by-election in early October. They stand a good chance of winning another seat in another by-election in November in the constituency of Rochester and Strood. According to a survey conducted for The Independent newspaper earlier this week, support for the once-fringe party has surged to 19 per cent, while a third of people polled said they believed the party offered a “realistic alternative political vision”.
The UKIP bugbear
UKIP’s rhetoric has had Britain’s mainstream parties on the backfoot, with the substantial public support they have garnered making the Conservatives as well as Labour reluctant to dismiss many of the “concerns” they have raised, both about (EU and non-EU) immigration into the UK and EU membership. It is noteworthy that when the Defence Secretary warned that immigrants were “swamping” some British towns, (he subsequently retracted his remarks) a Labour spokesperson simply dismissed his comments as a case of electioneering before the by-election.
The Labour party did not challenge the anti-immigrant presumptions on which his remarks were based. (That the concerns about immigrants have little basis in reality was highlighted this week in a study conducted by journalists at the London daily City AM who found that UKIP was at its most popular in areas of low immigration.)
UKIP has also cornered the Conservatives into adopting an increasingly hectoring and aggressive tone when it comes to Europe.
A recent demand from the European Commission that Britain pay a further €1.7 billion into the joint coffer is a case in point: following revisions to the way British Gross National Income was calculated over a 12-year period, it emerged that Britain had performed better than expected and, according to terms it had previously agreed to, had to step up the additional payments, alongside a number of other member states (others that had overpaid such as Germany were told they were owed a rebate).
Making it worse
Cameron’s reaction was to express his “downright” anger with the Commission, and state that the demand was “totally unacceptable”. Coming days after he pledged to take steps to curb migration from within the EU (going against one of its founding principles) his comments only served to alienate him further from other European leaders. Leaders such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel who have, to date, been patient with Britain’s stubbornness on a number of EU issues, have expressed their firm opposition to the plans to curb migration. Outgoing EU Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso told a gathering at Chatham House in London last week it would be a “historic mistake” for Britain to continue to alienate its natural allies within the EU by questioning principles at the very heart of the union.
Far from heading off the UKIP-challenge, the British government’s strategy has only exacerbated it as politics continues to shift rightwards and away from Europe.
Much will depend on the general election next year. Conservative hopes of bringing in legislation that would guarantee a referendum in 2017 have been dashed (the Bill collapsed on Monday following opposition from the Conservative’s coalition partner, the Liberal Democrats). However it is far from the end of the matter: the Conservatives could still press ahead with the referendum if they score an outright victory or reach a deal to hold one if they were once again in a coalition government.
Overall, the situation is bad news for the 700-odd Indian companies that have chosen to make Britain their European headquarters — many on the presumption that it has been and will remain a tariff-free gateway to the region. While EU membership might not wholly determine the huge affinity that high networth Indians have for the London property market, businesses are likely to take a harsher view, particularly given the uncertainty in the run-up to a referendum.

Food inflation: Know your onionsTweet
OOnions are forever Driving inflation KOMMURI SRINIVAS
Overall inflation is down, but not fruit and vegetable prices. Marketing, storage and information flows need to improve
In January 2014, the Reserve Bank of India formally adopted a ‘glide path’ for achieving a consumer price inflation (CPI) target of 8 per cent by January 2015 and 6 per cent by January 2016. Tight monetary policy has reined in headline inflation from 9.8 per cent in September 2013 to 6.5 per cent in September 2014 as measured by consumer price index (CPI combined). But fruit and vegetable prices have remained stubbornly high. Food price inflation declined from 11.8 per cent to 7.7 per cent over the period but fruits and vegetables rule high at 22.4 per cent and 8.6 per cent, respectively.
Food constitutes about 48 per cent of the CPI and plays a significant role in retail inflation. As observed in the September 30 monetary policy report, food price shocks have large and persistent effects on inflation expectations. This extends to prices of non-food items, contributing to overall inflation. Fruits and vegetables, which constitute a mere 8 per cent of the inflation index, continue to contribute significantly to headline inflation. In India, food inflation has stayed very high over the last decade, especially in the case of vegetables. While the Government has intervened heavily in the markets for cereals, pulses and edible oils, the prices of vegetables fluctuate tremendously.
Our data analysis from 2005 onwards reveals that variations in acreage and yields have contributed to erratic supply of vegetables. Production is vulnerable to weather shocks, and due to inadequate infrastructure for cold storage drying, is immediately transmitted to markets in terms of price rise.
Vulnerable areas
The key vulnerable commodities are potatoes and onions based on our analysis of the last 13 food price shocks --- incidences when the percentage increase in the food inflation index was more than 3 per cent of the previous month’s index. Potatoes figured nine times and onions seven times in this analysis.
To illustrate, onion is cultivated all over India but nearly two-third of the production comes from Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. India is the world’s second largest producer of onions though it lags behind world average productivity. As a percentage of total production, nearly one-tenth of the onions are exported. However, since last year, India has been importing onions.
Generally, hoarding is blamed for price fluctuations. The crop’s cultivation has a specific cycle, and to maintain year-round availability, farmers, traders and middlemen are compelled to store these commodities. Contrary to general belief, storing happens at each level of the supply chain, including the farmer. From the farmer’s perspective, if the current wholesale price is too low, it makes business sense to wait for it to rise and then sell it in the market. Of course, there is a trade-off: the longer it is stored, the more water and weight it loses, reducing overall revenue, not to mention the added warehouse or cold storage rental expense. Often, farmers do not harvest the onions until the prices are favourable, but they run the risk of spoilage and sprouting.
Pricing loopholes
Currently the process of dissemination of prices is informal. The farmers/traders contact the commission agents in a particular mandi and fix a range of acceptable prices. If the commission agent does not achieve that price for one day, the stock is sold the next day at the best available price.
This system reflects gaps in the transmission of price information to farmers. The potential for agents’ collusion in the determination of prices could hamper the revenue potential for farmers. The Government’s initiatives to control prices can be grouped as domestic price regulation; intermittent bans on exports and minimum export price regulations; controlling import duties for onions; and storage initiatives by National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (Nafed), and the Central and State warehousing corporations. The need is to adopt measures to accurately forecast demand and supply of onions and develop a robust agricultural marketing system.
To anchor expectations and stabilise prices, Nafed procures onions under the market intervention scheme on an ad hoc basis. A new scheme incorporating minimum support price could be considered. Finally, there is a need to formalise updating and dissemination of information to farmers through an internet database. Streamlining agricultural markets would help ease the pressure on monetary policy The RBI can then manage the demand side through interest rates without supply side concerns.

Nearly half are NRIs, Attorney- General tells Supreme Court
A day after the Supreme Court rapped the Centre for “providing a protective umbrella to foreign bank account holders,” the Union government on Wednesday submitted, in a sealed cover, a list of 627 Indians holding black money abroad. The Centre also gave a status report on the investigations against such account holders.
A Bench comprising Chief Justice H.L. Dattu and Justices Ranjana Desai and Madan B. Lokur made it clear to Attorney-General Mukul Rohatgi that it did not intend to open the envelopes, and asked the Registry to send them to the Special Investigation Team. It directed that the envelopes be opened only by the SIT chairman, Justice M.B. Shah, and vice-chairman, Justice Arijit Pasayat, to conduct a further investigation.
The Bench empowered the SIT to evolve its own procedure after hearing the Centre’s stand on India’s tax treaties and the submissions of petitioner, Ram Jethmalani. The Bench asked the SIT to submit a status report on its investigation by November 30 and posted the matter for further hearing on December 3.
Earlier, Mr. Rohatgi submitted that the first list contained details of correspondence, treaties and agreements that India had signed with France and other nations where the illegal money was said to be stashed. He said the second list contained all the 627 names and the third gave the status report on the probe in these cases. Mr. Rohatgi said more than half the people on the list of 627 were Indian nationals, while the rest were NRIs. He said most of them had accounts with the HSBC Bank, Geneva.

US cant seal itself off: Obama on Ebola fighthealthcare policy
"Doctors and nurses from the United States who have volunteered to fight Ebola in West Africa are American heroes who must be treated with dignity and respect"
Pushing to confront Ebola at its West African source, President Barack Obama said Wednesday the United States was not immune to the disease but cautioned against discouraging American health care workers with restrictive measures that confine them upon their return from the afflicted region. “We can’t hermetically seal ourselves off,” he declared.
Mr. Obama said doctors and nurses from the United States who have volunteered to fight Ebola in West Africa are American heroes who must be treated with dignity and respect.
“Yes, we are likely to see a possible case elsewhere outside of these countries, and that’s true whether or not we adopt a travel ban, whether or not you adopt a quarantine,” Mr. Obama said from the White House, surrounded by health care workers who have volunteered or will volunteer to serve in Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea, where the disease has killed nearly 5,000.
“We have to keep in mind that if we’re discouraging our health care workers, who are prepared to make these sacrifices, from travelling to these places in need, then we’re not doing our job in terms of looking after our own public health and safety,” he added.
Mr. Obama did not mention any specific case, but a nurse who treated Ebola patients in West Africa and has shown no signs of the disease was isolated in a hospital tent in New Jersey and now is abiding by a voluntary quarantine in her home state of Maine. The nurse, Kaci Hickox, said Wednesday that she planned to defy those guidelines if the state’s policy didn’t change by Thursday.
The White House has argued that stricter measures adopted by states such as New Jersey and New York could hurt efforts to recruit doctors and nurses to volunteer their services in West Africa. The federal government’s guidance says only health care workers who have been exposed to Ebola directly, such as through a needle pin prick or by not having adequate protection, should face isolation.
Still, the Pentagon announced guidelines Wednesday that said U.S. troops returning from Ebola response missions in West Africa will be kept in supervised isolation for 21 days. Mr. Obama has said the military’s situation is different from that of civilians, in part because troops are not in West Africa by choice.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest rejected suggestions that the policies employed by the Pentagon and states that are stricter than guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conveys a mixed message to the American public.
“The fact of the matter is, those differences in application of the policy have not interfered with the ability of the federal government to coordinate with them as these policies are implemented,” he said.
The president was introduced by Dr. Kent Brantly, who was infected with Ebola while working in Liberia and was successfully treated in the United States.
Ahead of his appearance, Mr. Obama met in the secure Situation Room with his public health and national security team on the government’s Ebola response.
Mr. Obama’s Ebola response coordinator, Ron Klain, was planning his first visit to the CDC in Atlanta on Thursday. The White House said Klain would meet with Director Dr. Tom Frieden and other senior CDC officials.

ED summons Marans in Aircel-Maxis deal  assets attachment to followinquiry
The agency is expected to issue an attachment order for seizing assets worth over Rs. 600 crore in the case before which questioning of the accused is necessary.
The Enforcement Directorate has issued summons against the Maran brothers — Dayanidhi and Kalanithi — and all other accused in Aircel-Maxis money laundering probe case.
The agency, sources said, has issued the notices under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and they have summoned the accused to examine them and record their statements.
The agency is expected to issue an attachment order for seizing of assets of an estimated value of over Rs. 600 crore in this case before which this questioning is necessary, they said.
“All the accused in this case, as taking per the CBI case registered against them, have been summoned by ED,” sources said.
The ED is expected to issue attachment orders within few weeks time, they added.
Besides the Maran brothers, the CBI has named Malaysian business tycoon T. Ananda Krishnan, Malaysian national Augustus Ralph Marshall and four firms — Sun Direct TV, Maxis Communication Berhad, Astro All Asia Network and South Asia Entertainment Holding — as accused.
The CBI has charged them with the offences punishable under section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC and under relevant provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.
The CBI had alleged in the court that Mr. Dayanidhi Maran had “pressured” and “forced” Chennai-based telecom promoter C. Sivasankaran to sell his stakes in Aircel and two subsidiary firms to Malaysian firm Maxis Group in 2006.
The ED’s money laundering case is based on this.

India should do more to maintain peace at border: ChinaThe Hindu File photo shows a signpost at the India-China border in Bumla, Arunachal Pradesh.

India-China
“Dispute still exists in the eastern part of China-India border,” China’s Defence Ministry said when asked about India's plans to build 54 new border posts in Arunachal Pradesh.
China’s military on Thursday expressed concern over India’s plan to construct 54 new border posts in Arunachal Pradesh, saying India should not complicate the situation and do more to maintain peace as it is a “disputed area”.
“We have noticed relevant report. Dispute still exists in the eastern part of China-India border,” Defence Ministry spokesman Yang Yujin told a media briefing in Beijing when asked about the plans announced by the Union Home Ministry to build 54 new border posts in Arunachal Pradesh.
“We urge the Indian side to do more to maintain peace and stability in the area and not do things that may complicate the situation,” he said.
Asked why China is wary of India’s development of infrastructure along the border when it has carried out extensive development on its side, Mr. Yang said, “I think that the roads you are talking about are in the eastern part of the China-India border which is still a disputed area.”
“China’s position on the dispute in this area is clear and consistent,” he said.
“It is an important consensus reached by the two sides to maintain peace and stability along the Line of Actual Control and both sides should do more towards converging direction rather than contrary,” he said.
Indian government last week announced setting up of 54 new border outposts and a Rs. 175-crore package for beefing up the infrastructure along the border in Arunachal Pradesh.
Mr. Yang’s comments on the border posts and the road network along the Arunachal Pradesh border was in line with the views expressed by the Chinese foreign ministry earlier this month.
Reacting to the border posts plan, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying had earlier said that “pending the final settlement of the boundary question, we hope that the Indian side could refrain from taking any action that may complicate or exaggerate the question”.
Chinese Foreign Ministry has also reacted earlier on the plans announced by Minister of State for Home, Kiren Rijiju, to construct a road network along the international boundary from Mago-Thingbu in Tawang to Vijaynagar in Changlang district of Arunachal Pradesh to match China’s infrastructure development.
“There is a dispute about the east part of the China-India border. Before final settlement is reached we hope that India will not take any action that may further complicate the situation,” spokesman Hong Lei said on October 15, 2014.
Mr. Yang said on Thursday that the agreements like setting up hotlines between the two militaries and improving communications between the command posts reached during this month’s meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) in New Delhi put very important and positive inputs into bilateral relations and can help to deal with the border issues in a timely manner.

Doctors correct cardiac problem in foetal babyDoctors correct cardiac problem in foetal baby

Hyderabad, Oct. 30:  
Terminating pregnancy is not an easy decision for parents, particularly when the foetus developing organs and limbs but with a critical problem in one of those vital organs. About 8-10 babies out of 1,000 are getting afflicted with some cardiac problems. And about two of them develop infections in valves, leading to blocks and ending pregnancies in abortions.
The 25-year-old school teacher Sirisha and her husband faced that tough question when doctors at the Care Hospitals found a severe obstruction in the aortic valve, resulting in failure of pumping of left ventricle to the body. They would have gone for termination like most pregnant women do.
“A normal course in such cases is abortion. But we suggested an intervention that could save the life of the baby. A science teacher, Sirisha courageously accepted the advice,” K Nageshwar Rao, chief pediatric cardiologist, has said.
“We have used a thin needle (thinner than those we use for taking injections) and reached the infected part to open the passage,” he said.
A team of 12 doctors and paramedics have taken part in the intervention, claimed to be a first in the country.
Second time successful
The doctors, however, were not successful in the first instance as the baby’s position was not favourable for an intervention. Dejected, the couple went home but only to be called back by the doctors who presented a new strategy to attend to the problem.
“We have decided to wait till the baby’s position in the womb turn convenient for us to start the procedure,” the doctor said.
While the mother was given general anaesthesia, the baby was given intra-muscular injection in the thigh for foetal anaesthesia to avoid its movements during the procedure. The mother’s abdomen was reached using a needle and the needle was guided through the uterus and to the chest and finally to the left ventricle.
“With an appropriate balloon and wire, the aortic valve was dilated to relieve the block. The baby was given medications to maintain heart rate and circulation,” the doctor said.
The baby will be monitored continuously in the womb and after the delivery. The procedure could cost Rs 3 lakh but the hospital subsidised the costs.

Experiment with authentic Doenjang Jjigae, smoky pork and Erongba in this quick, practical and endearingly home-style restaurant
I’m torn. I don’t know which I find more fascinating. The momos or our waiter. Wrapped in an almost translucent, steamed casing, the plump momos are served with a feisty red chilly paste. Our waiter, on the other hand, is more endearingly chirpy than feisty. “So, what’s Doenjang Jjigae,” we ask, studying the menu. Short pause. “Oh no,” he exclaims, clutching his meticulously gelled spiky hair. “I forgot.” It’s impossible to be exasperated. He’s so earnest. So endearingly intent on making us feel at home at this bare, but homely, restaurant, obviously built more on cheery enthusiasm than wily business acumen.
Despite North East Kitchen’s unprepossessing setting, in a ramshackle building right beside a chaotic bike parking lot, the interiors are restful — if rather randomly decorated. With artificial flowers and faux wooden floors, the tiny two-level restaurant aims more at being functional than plush: sensible tables, topped with plastic sauce bottles, wooden toothpicks and containers crammed with forks, spoons and metal chopsticks.
We’re the only customers at lunch, and we’re determined to eat our way through the exotic menu, replete with unfamiliar foods. “Just a minute. I’ll ask and come back,” our waiter grins, before bounding away to the kitchen. He returns with answers, and a plate of those momos. And we fall upon them with sighs of satisfaction, he settles down quietly with a book. “What’s he reading?” my friend whispers. I squint at it subtly. “It looks like the title is Questions young people ask,” I say. We all coo in unison. “Aw.”
The momos come with a clear and surprisingly tasty chicken soup, served in well-worn plastic bowls. It’s followed by fairly standard batter-wrapped chicken fry and an saucy tumble of Korean pork stir-fried with crunchy carrots, cabbage and kimchi. A word of caution for conservative eaters, this does taste quite unfamiliar thanks to the generous lashings of powerful soybean paste.
It comes with a slew of ‘side dishes’: Erongba, which is a chutney of sorts with well-mashed brinjal and potatoes, liberally spiked with green chilly. There’s a bowl of wilted emerald green spinach and a spicy salad of sprouts served with minced onions and chillies.
This Korean–North East theme is admittedly eccentric. However, it makes sense when we meet the restaurant owner- cook, Ramayon Keishing. “I’m from Manipur and I worked with Hyundai for ten years,” he says, “So I know what kind of food the Korean executives like to eat.” Realising that there was no north-eastern restaurant in the city, despite its large north-eastern population, he decided to create a space that brought together the two cuisines.
For the main course, we try smoked pork, served in a curry-thickened with tomato pulp and interspersed with snappy green beans. The only glitch is the overcooked capsicum. Continuing the pork theme, there’s a dish of the fatty, buttery meat served in a thin oily curry with tender bamboo shoots. Then there’s a beef curry in rich, sticky gravy.
The food in general is skilfully cooked, but strictly home- style. No fancy bells and whistles here. It’s also unapologetically authentic, so be prepared for unfamiliar ingredients and flavours. This city is full of restaurants frantically trying to offer ‘something for everyone.’ North East Kitchen just offers Ramayon’s cooking. Just like in anyone’s home, some days will be better than others. And some dishes will be better than others. So it’s necessarily niche. Which, honestly, is its biggest strength.
North East Kitchen is at No. 24, Wellingdon Estate, Ethiraj Salai. Call 9003542066 or 8608653055 for details. A meal for two is around Rs 600.

In his inaugural address, Minister for Public Works VK Ebrahim Kunju emphasised the need to promote organic culture as an alternative to today’s toxic food items.
There is a need to encourage traditional farmers to return to organic farming and the government should offer adequate financial support or subsidy schemes for crop and food products, he added. He hoped that the expo would be helpful to stimulate the organic farming and its benefits through exhibitions of organic food products and various interactive programmes.
The festival also focuses on providing training programme for farmers to become entrepreneurs. The five-day exhibition consists of India organic fair and various technical sessions including workshop on organic crop production, organic spices, organic fruits, organic aquaculture, value addition of organic products and best practices in animal husbandry.

Asks TV channel not to make malicious references to Telangana State, MLAs
Hyderabad, Oct. 30:  
The Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) has asked the MSOs (Multiple system operators) to resume the broadcast of TV9 channel within a week (from October 29).

It directed the Government to file an affidavit in this regard by November 5. It, however, put the onus on the television channel to abide by the Programme Code and the Advertisement Code prescribed under the Cable Television Networks Rules, 1994.
It also asked the channel not to indulge in making any false and malicious references to the State of Telangana or its people or its government or its elected representatives.
The MSOs have barred the channel (and also the ABN Andhra Jyothi channel) after it aired a programme that heckled at the legislators of Telangana, a few days after the new Government had taken charge. Incensed, the MSOs barred the channel saying they were getting threats from the public for airing the programmes of the channel.
The tribunal had sought the opinion of the Solicitor General of India on the issue last week.
Finances crippled
Meanwhile, the prolonged blockade had a telling impacting on the finances of the channel. It reportedly cut the salaries of its employees by 50 per cent. Minimum take home has been fixed at Rs 20,000.
“We will restore the salaries once the revenues are restored,” the management reportedly told its employees.
The blockade of the channel had impacted the valuation of the company that wanted to give an exit route to the original investors.

DDA to Webcast  Housing scheme 2014  Draw Live on YouTubeNew Delhi: The eagerly-awaited draw of lots for the flagship 'DDA Housing Scheme 2014' next month can be seen online as the housing authority has decided to webcast the entire event, a top official said today.
The webcast would be available for "unlimited" number of online users through a YouTube channel.
"A meeting was held with various vendors a few days ago, and the DDA vice-chairman has approved the proposal to webcast the draw through live streaming," Director (Systems) of DDA, V S Tomar told PTI.
The tentative date for draw of the lots for the new scheme, which offers over 25,000 flats across various categories, ranging from Rs 7 lakh to Rs 1.2 crore, is November 5. The scheme closed on October 15 and has received over 8.5 lakh applications.
"Delhi-based vendors with prior experience in webcasting approached us and proposed to stream the event online through YouTube. We decided on YouTube and not DDA's official website to preclude any chance of crashing of the site, given the online traffic it would attract on the D-Day," Mr Tomar said.
He said the proposal was approved as the proposed budget for the project by the vendors, turned out to be "cost-effective".
"The proposal also will have no cap on online users as the video would be streamed online through a YouTube channel," he said.
Gearing up for the draw, the DDA has planned to dedicate a server to deal with the anticipated "rush of online traffic" on its official website.
"As per the vendor for the draw, C-DAC again has been assigned the role, but the venue of the draw has not been finalised yet. It will either be Noida, where the C-DAC office and servers are located, or at the DDA headquarters, Vikas Sadan itself," he said.
C-DAC (Centre for Development of Advanced Computing) had also conducted the draw for DDA's last housing scheme in 2010.
"Both places have their pros and cons, and we want to conduct the procedure in the best possible way. If C-DAC agrees to shift its server at the Vikas Sadan, then we can do it either in our Auction Hall or the Conference Hall, both having a capacity of between 200-250," he added.
Mr Tomar said it was decided not to provide a link for the webcast on the DDA website as it would become prone to crash.
As part of our preparations ahead of the draw, DDA has planned to set up a dedicated served around the last week of this month, and it will have load-balancing facilities, to avert chances of crashing the website due to heavy traffic.
Meanwhile, the procedure for the draw has also been uploaded on the website and applicants can check the status of their application online.
"The draw takes about 60-90 minutes, and after 30 minutes or so we would be able to come up with the list of successful applicants on our official website," Mr Tomar said.
The draw would be overseen by a three-member team headed by a retired high court judge. It would also have two IT professionals, one from IIT-Delhi and another from the National Informatics Centre (NIC) to supervise the process.
The draw, which would be computerised, follows the system adopted in the 1980s, before which the draw was taken out manually.
This scheme offers 25,034 flats, across various categories, namely EWS, LIG, MIG, HIG, Janta flats and one-room apartments. The 22,627 one-bed room apartments was a major draw for people this year.
The DDA official website had crashed on the day of launch of the scheme, following a massive response from online users prompting authorities to upgrade its server to meet the high-traffic demand.

Sensex @ fresh life high of 27 390; five reasons why index is surgingBirla Sun
(The S&P BSE Sensex hit…)
NEW DELHI: Both S&P BSE Sensex and Nifty made fresh highs today, surging nearly 2 per cent each in trade on Friday. The 30-share index ended the day at 27,865.83, up 519.50 points, or 1.90 per cent. The Nifty shut shop at 8322.20, up 153 points, or 1.87 per cent.
The Sensex hit its fresh lifetime high of 27,894.32 in intraday trade, while the 50-share Nifty index rose over 150 points to make its all-time high of 8,330.75.
The previous all-time high for Sensex was 27,354.99.
Here are seven reasons why markets made fresh highs:
1. US Fed ends QE but maintains status quo on interest rates:
The US Federal Reserve has ended its quantitative easing program, which it began five years ago, to keep economy afloat in the wake of a huge financial crisis.
While the market was anticipating winding up of quantitative easing by the US Fed, there were concerns regarding the US interest rates.
However, the US Fed assuaged investor concerns by maintaining its stand of keeping benchmark short-term rate near zero 'for a considerable time'. This is giving comfort to investors as inflows are expected to continue with ease till at least mid next year.
"As far as its impact on emerging markets - particularly India - is concerned, India has made an adjustment since last year. When QE is reversed, there will be some capital outflow, some adjustment, but that will be nothing compared to the taper tantrums we had last year. There will be a quick adjustment through a fairly stable equilibrium," said Former RBI Governor D Subbarao to ET Now.
2. Liquidity flow to continue in India: The US has ended its quantitative easing program, but inflows in Indian markets are likely to continue as other countries such as Japan and Europe are extending their easing monetary policy.
The earnings cycle is expected to improve in the next few quarters, there are hopes of lower interest rates and pick-up in growth in Indian economy in the next couple of years.
"While the US does say that it is going to withdraw QE, I would expect that both Japan and Europe will continue with monetary and quantitative easing for a couple of quarters more. The early indications seem to suggest so," said Sashi Krishnan , Chief Investment Officer, Birla Sun Life Insurance.
"Therefore, if you look at the net liquidity that gets added to the global markets, I do not think they are going to get impacted too much," Krishnan added.
3. Government on reforms track: The government is working towards carrying outs its reforms agenda. After diesel de-regulation and forming an ordinance on coal blocks, it has now relaxed norms in the construction sector.
The Cabinet has decided to allow 100 per cent FDI under automatic route and lowered cap on minimum investment to $5 million from $10 million earlier.
According to the government, the measures taken by it are likely to attract investments in new areas and encourage development of plots for serviced housing given the shortage of land in and around urban agglomerations as well as the high cost of land.
These are confidence boosting measures and raise hopes of more reform-oriented policies in the coming months. Analysts are expecting the next budget will be pro-reforms. This is likely to keep foreign investors bullish and lead to more inflows in India.
4. Electoral success in assembly elections: The win for the BJP continues at the ballot. After impressive performance in the Lok Sabha , the party has bettered its performance in the states of Haryana and Maharashtra. The party has got first its first ever chief ministers in Haryana and Maharashtra.
The outcome of assembly elections will improve the party's tally in the upper house of Parliament and help the government in passing important bills in both the houses.
"There are a lot of positive thoughts around the Indian economy right now, largely thanks to the impressive election victory by Mr. Modi's party. If they achieve some of the things that they set to achieve in terms of making the Indian economy less bureaucratic to a certain extent and more efficient, then that could see growth rates rise," said William Hobbs , VP Research, Economics & Strategy at Barclays.
5. Favourable macros: The macros for the Indian economy are improving with easing inflation and lower commodities prices. There are expectations that the RBI may lower interest rates earlier than expected as inflation is coming under the RBI's target zone.
"Over the last several months, since this government has come to office, we have seen macro indicators stabilising - indeed improving. Growth is in an uptrend, inflation is on a downtrend, and there have been significant adjustments on the current account , fiscal consolidation is on track, investment sentiment is reviving, etc," said Subbarao.
"All these improved indicators will deliver cyclical upturn in growth from below 5 per cent last year to 5.5 per cent this fiscal year, and to may be 6 to 6.5 per cent in the next couple of years," he added.

Markets expensive; don t make fresh buys: ExpertEdelweiss Financial Services
(Wherever there are good…)
In a chat with ET Now, Vikas Khemani of Edelweiss Financial Services , shares his thoughts on the realty sector. Excerpts:
ET Now: One has really seen the move come in on realty of late. It could just be a trading play, but what is the sense that you are getting? Could these sectors now, which have been so bogged down with a lot of negative news, become investment bets?
Vikas Khemani: Realty, as a sector, looks very interesting, with it being interest rate sensitive, very much leveraged to the economic growth, employment creation, etc.
But unfortunately, you could not have many large players in this sector without any issues. If you look at some of the large players, they have had many issues recently. That is why investors are a bit hesitant to commit large amount of money in this. Wherever there are good quality stocks and good quality companies, they are very small where investors cannot come in.
But if you ask me if realty companies will do well, then the answer is yes. But currently, the choice of stocks to play for investors is very very limited and that problem continues to remain.

Truecaller launches new phone dialer appTruedialer gives instant access to relevant information about contacts that users are trying to dial.
By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Posted: October 30, 2014 5:34 pm | Updated: October 31, 2014 10:35 am
Truecaller has launched a new phone dialer app called Truedialer. The app is available for free on Android and Windows Phone. Truedialer aims to replace the standard dialing interfaces on smartphones and give instant access to relevant information about contacts that users are trying to dial.
If users are dialing a number for an individual or business outside of their phonebook, they’ll be able to see the name, and even a profile photo of whom they’re about to dial before they place the call. The integration of the Truecaller technology works in conjunction with Truedialer.
With the new Truedialer app, users can search for information about a number they are dialing. As a number, dialed, Truedialer searches the contact list and Truecaller’s database to provide the name of an individual or business belonging to a number even if it is not saved in the contact list.
Also, it fills in missing contact information in the call log with information from Truecaller’s database. To prevent spam and scams, if the dialed number has been reported by Truecaller’s community as an unwanted number, the user will be warned before placing the call.
“Until now, phone dial pads have not truly improved since the feature phone days. With the same infrastructure that powers Truecaller, our ambition with Truedialer is to replace the phone’s phonebook app, and be invaluable to users, just as Truecaller has changed the way people receive calls and find contact information,” said Nami Zarringhalam, co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer at Truecaller.

Alert! Scammers pose as CEOs in wire transfer spamcampaignThe scammers send an email to a target recipient usually pretending to be from the CEO or a senior executive of an organisation.
By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Posted: October 30, 2014 8:55 pm | Updated: October 30, 2014 8:57 pm
Internet security first Symantec has issued an alert about spam campaigns involving fake wire transfer request emails. Symantec said such mails try to get the recipient to process a payment for non-existent goods or services by way of a wire or credit transfer.
“The scammers send an email to a target recipient usually pretending to be from the CEO or a senior executive of an organisation. The scammers will usually send the fake wire transfer emails to employees working in the finance department of a company, as those employees will have the ability to action payment requests,” a blog post said.
The company warned that scammers were found registering domains similar to the target domain. “For example, if a scammer was targeting a user at exampledomain.com they might register the domain exampledoma1n.com or exaampledomain.com. So for example, you might receive an email sent to you at yourname@exampledomain.com from CEO@exaampledomain.com,” it said, adding that the scammer here is hoping users might not notice the subtle difference in domain.
It was noted that the scammers are sending the emails out on the same day that they are registering the domains. This is likely in the hope that they can extract payment before the domain is reported and suspended.
Verification:
If you receive a wire transfer request that seems out of the ordinary, always check that the sender is who they say they are. Ask yourself: is it normal procedure for your CEO to decide that you’re the best (or only) person to help in that situation? Check the email headers to see where the email has originated from.
If you receive an email with a thread that you’ve supposedly been sent before, check with the person who has supposedly sent the email. Reply to the sender but obtain their email address using your company’s address book in your email client.

Chhattisgarh CM Raman lauches online communication withcitizensPrint
By: Express News Service | Ranchi | Posted: October 30, 2014 8:54 pm
Beginning an online communication platform with citizens, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh on Thursday launched a unique programme of e-Jandarshan. When he is in Raipur, Singh often meets people at his residence every Thursday and listens to their grievances. On Thursday, he met people online and conversed with them on camera through Google Hangout from 11 am to 1 pm.
According to an official statement Singh has become the first Chief Minister of the country to have established online contact with public.
Singh said that once in a month he would have e-Jandarshan and invited all the people of state to join him in this initiative.
To ensure success of this programme, the administration had begun the process months ago. It first uploaded an application form on Singh’s official website and asked people to fill and submit it with their grievances.
“We received 178 applications and selected 50 from 9 districts. They assembled at NIC office at district headquarters. While 31 applicants managed to converse with him today and register their grievances, the applications of others would be resolved through normal jan darshan,” Rajat Kumar, Director Public Relation, Chhattisgarh, told The Indian Express.
Some persons came on their own, the travel of a few others was arranged by the administration.
Kumar said that the administration called them to NIC office to ensure good internet connectivity. “Next time we will keep an option. If people have good connectivity at home, they need not visit NIC office,” he added.
Among the applicants, one was Gaurishankar Patel from Kapu area of Raigarh district. He complained that members of a local cooperative society are unable to withdraw their payments worth nearly Rs 30 lakh from District Cooperative Central Bank. Singh immediately told Raigarh Collector Mukesh Bansal to send report about the matter and also instructed him to ensure that members their payments soon.

Think about those mothers whose children go missing: SC to ChhattisgarhgovtPrint
By: Express News Service | Raipur | Posted: October 30, 2014 8:33 pm | Updated: October 30, 2014 8:48 pm
Taking a strict note of the indifferent approach of Chhattisgarh government towards its missing children, the Supreme Court on Thursday pulled up its top officials for submitting a wrong affidavit in the matter. Talking tough, the Chief Justice HL Dattu told the officials that they must think about “the mothers whose children have gone missing”.
While the Central government had told the parliament in August that the number of untraced children from 2011-2013 in Chhattisgarh was 3129, the state on Thursday informed the apex court that the number stood nearly three times lesser at 1204.
Following a petition by Bachpan Bachao Andolan that child trafficking is rampant in Chhattisgarh, the Supreme Court had asked the state government to file a status report in this regard.
Chhattisgarh’s DGP AN Upadhyaya and Acting Chief Secretary DS Misra on Thursday submitted the affidavit only to be strongly rebuked by the court.
The court gave them time till November 13 to file an additional affidavit and told them that it would not be appropriate if they submit such affidavit again. “What if the children of officials go missing,” the court said.
“The Central government has already told the parliament in August this year that the number of missing children in Chhattisgarh is 3129. There is a huge discrepancy between that figure and the data submitted by the government today. It cannot be the case that they recovered all these children in two months. If that had been the situation, they must have informed the court,” Bachpan Bachao Andolan’s Bhuvan Ribhu told The Indian Express.
“We are not talking about numbers but human lives. Each child is important and his missing must be accounted for,” he said, adding that according to the NCRB figures, 436 children have gone missing in Chhattisgarh up to May this year only.
“The petitioner has alleged some discrepancy between our data and the figures presented in the Rajya Sabha. The court has given us time to reconcile to the figure. We will submit a fresh affidavit,” said a senior official of the Chhattisgarh government.
The tribal areas of North Chhattisgarh comprising Surguja, Balrampur and Jashpur report high incidences of missing children. They are trafficked to metro cities where they are subjected to various forms of exploitation.

Orissa to amend OPLE Act that would declare encroachment as cognisableoffencePrint
Written by Debabrata Mohanty | Bhubaneswar | Posted: October 30, 2014 8:33 pm
In a bid to free up thousands of acres of government land under encroachment all over the State, the Naveen Patnaik government is all set to amend its 42-year-old anti-encroachment Act that would make encroachment a cognisable offence.
With 39000 acres of the state government lands under encroachment, sources said the amendments to the Orissa Prevention of Land Encroachment Act, 1972 would be passed in the coming State Cabinet meet. The amendments would be passed by the Assembly in next months’s winter session.
Though the OPLE Act was enacted to prevent unauthorised occupation of government land, the fine and penalty was very low in comparision to the growing value of the land. The provisions were inadequate to deter habitual offenders and rich and influential person from grabbing the government land.
The amendments modelled after the Andhra Pradesh Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Act, 1982 would make encroachment a cognisable offence.
As per the old Act, if a person had encroached a government land for more than 30 years then the land were settled in his name. But in the amended Act, such encroachment would be declared as cognisable offence.
“On the one hand unobjectionable encroachments could be settled in favour of the poor people who have occupied the government land for basic livelihood. on the other hand, effective and stringent action could be taken against landgrabbers so as to have a deterrent effect and to prevent further encroachments,” said a revenue department official.
For encroachments of drainage and water channels, the new Act has a provision of fine of Rs 1000 and daily fine of Rs 100. In the old Act, there was no provision for entry to the premises, seizure and removal of the materials and equipments by the tehsildar or collector.
The new Act would have such a provision for entry, seizure and removal of the materials.
Tehsildars would also be given powers to give direction to local bodies, companies and different authorities of the department providing services like electricity, water, telephone and sewerage services for disconnection and stop supply to the unauthorisedly occupied land. If such bodies don’t comply with the orders of tehsildar, fines can be imposed.
In the old Act, the tehsildar had the discretionary power to levy penalty of Rs 100 per acre for each year of illegal encroachment in addition to the assessment of the land rate. But in the amended Act, the discretionary power of tehsildar has been withdrawn. But homesteadless and landless persons would have to pay only the market rate of the land without any penalty.
For levy of assessment of encroachment, the old Act had the provision that the tehsildar had the discretionary power to impose rent upto maximum five times of the annual assessment for homesteadless persons.
In the new Act, the discretionary power of a tehsildar to impose a lesser sum or imposing penalty on homesteadless person has been withdrawn.
The old Act had the provision of summary eviction, forefeiture and fine for landless persons who had unauthorisedly occupied government land. Now under the amended Act, to settle the land the person must have used the land for agriculture continued…

Austerity drive to save Rs 40K cr but poses risks to growth: NomuraAusterity drive
(The govt's austerity drive…)
MUMBAI: The government's austerity drive announced today, would lead to a saving of up to Rs 40,000 crore or 0.3 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) but poses risks to growth, Japanese brokerage Nomura has said.
"On our estimates this would amount to a saving of Rs 35,000 to Rs 40,000 crore or 0.3 per cent of the GDP," it said in a note issued here today.
The finance ministry issued a circular today instructing government departments to cut discretionary spending by 10 per cent. As part of these measures, it banned first class travel by government officials, meetings in five-star hotels, purchase of cars and froze new appointments.
Nomura said that the move may have been initiated as a precaution against potential shortfall in capital receipts, mainly disinvestment proceeds, where the government target is to raise 0.5 per cent of GDP or over Rs 43,000 crore.
Moreover, with reports saying that the government is looking at an additional capital infusion of upto Rs 11,000 crore into state-run banks, this could be undertaken with an eye on additional spending needs, it said.
"Overall, these measures reaffirm the government's commitment to fiscal consolidation and its ability to meet the budgeted target of 4.1 percent of GDP in FY15," it said.
However, the brokerage said that spending cuts pose "downside risks" to its GDP growth estimate of six per cent for the fiscal.
"Such measures are intended at promoting fiscal discipline, without restricting the operational efficiency of the government," a finance ministry statement said.
"In the context of the current fiscal situation, there is a need to continue to rationalise expenditure and optimise available resources," it said.

(British luxury car manufacturer…)
LONDON: Britain's Queen Elizabeth II drove up in a Tata Motors' Range Rover to inaugurate a new 500-million pound Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) engine plant here in the West Midlands region of England today.
The Queen, accompanied by husband Duke of Edinburgh and Tata Trusts chairman Ratan Tata, toured the state-of-the-art Engine Manufacturing Centre at i54 Business Park site near Wolverhampton before unveiling the inaugural plaque.
"This marks one of the most important days in this company's manufacturing history. It represents all that is great about British manufacturing and demonstrates the revitalisation of the Jaguar Land Rover business under the stewardship of the Tata Group," said Dr Ralf Speth, JLR CEO who led the royal guests on the tour of the new centre.
The 88-year-old Queen also met the employees currently employed at the plant, which will create 500 new jobs by 2015 and an estimated 1,400 jobs by 2016.
Eventually, the world-class centre is expected to generate a total of 5,500 jobs in the supply chain as part of the company's strategic investment programme under Tata Motors ownership.
The opening has been described as a seminal moment in history for the iconic luxury car-maker rescued by the Indian automotive giant back in 2008, when it stepped in to acquire the struggling brands from Ford.
After just six years, JLR is in a position to boost the automotive industry in Central England as it begins in-house engine production after nearly two decades since it last produced its own engines in April 1996.
It marks a remarkable turnaround from production and job cuts to nearly doubling sales and jobs under the firm's Indian ownership, recently recording a 2013/14 pre-tax profit of 2.5 billion pounds, up from 1.7 billion pounds a year before.
Together the royal group viewed the sprawling 100,000 square metre machining and assembly halls and also met a number local school children who have embarked on Jaguar Land Rover's industry leading educational engineering apprenticeship programmes.
The new engines that will now be produced at the new centre by JLR are currently sourced from PSA (Peugeot Citroen) as part of a PSA and Ford joint venture and are currently produced in France and Spain.
While JLR will continue sourcing its other engines from Ford in the long-term, the in-house production is aimed at making the luxury brand more competitive and flexible to respond to market needs and eventually future-proof its models.

E-commerce  euphoria  to last 18 months only in India: Kishore Biyani  Future GroupAmazon
("The euphoria should last…)
NEW DELHI: The "euphoria" over the scorching pace of eCommerce market in India will last about 18 months as things begin to settle down and "reality" sets in, Future Group chief Kishore Biyani today said.
Biyani has recently partnered with global e-tailing giant Amazon to sell its merchandise exclusively online.
Known as a pioneer of Indian retail chains, Biyani had criticised Flipkart and other e-commerce firms in India for under-cutting the market and selling products at below the cost price, saying that it would hurt other retail channels.
"The euphoria should last for 6-18 months. Then it will be over. You can't live in the euphoria and reality will set in," Biyani said at the Technopak Leadership Forum , E-tailing 2014.
Estimated to be a $ three billion segment, the Indian eCommerce sector has been growing at a massive pace with players like Snapdeal and Flipkart raising well over $ 4 billion from a range of investors including angel and private equity firms.
Also, world's largest online retailer Amazon has committed investment of $ 2 billion in the country over the next few years.
Asked if the brick and mortar stores will be impacted severely by the growing preference for online shopping, Biyani said all formats will survive.
"They will all survive, but not in their original form," he said.
Citing the example of Future Group he said the company has a mix of online and offline presence that helps them reach to customers.
"People used to go to haats and exhibitions in the past. They have not gone away. These will change forms but they will be there in some form," he said.
A report by consulting firm Technopak pegs the $ 2.3 billion e-tailing market to reach $ 32 billion by 2020.
According to reports, of the $ 1.02 billion dollars of investment that came into all software companies in India in 2013, as much as $ 808 million was in e-commerce companies.

Airtel, Vodafone, Idea and Reliance seek deferral of upcoming auction of airwaves

(The government is scheduled…)
KOLKATA: India's top four carriers have sought the telecom minister's urgent intervention to defer the upcoming auction and ensure that operators whose permits expire in 2015-16 be allowed to "continue with their existing in-use spectrum" till sufficient additional airwaves across bands are available for sale.
In a joint letter to Ravi Shankar Prasad , the telecom operators have reiterated the regulator's call for simultaneous auctioning of airwaves "across the 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz and 800 MHz bands, through a big-bang" spectrum sale.
The letter - written by Bharti Airtel MD & CEO Gopal Vittal , Vodafone India MD & CEO Marten Pieters , Idea Cellular MD Himanshu Kapania and Reliance Communications CEO (consumer business) Gurdeep Singh - was also marked to Prime Minister Narendra Modi , as the four companies sought to mount pressure on the government to defer the auctions which are tentatively scheduled to start in February 2015.
The letter also suggested that during the intervening period the licensees, whose initial term expires in 2015-16, pay "the price discovered in February 2014 for 1800 MHz with the 900 MHz multiplier" as proposed by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai). "This may be adjusted subsequently, if required, for the price discovered in the next round of auctions," it said.
India's biggest operator Bharti Airtel has 900 MHz holdings in 13 non-metro circles, of which six will expire by April 2016. Vodafone and Idea, the next two firms, have the same efficient spectrum in nine non-metro service areas, of which six and nine, respectively, will lapse by April 2016. Anil Ambani-led Reliance Communications' seven 900 MHz permits expire in December 2015.
According to the letter, the "common representation to offer a practical solution to the critical problem of inadequate spectrum availability for the next auction is in public interest as it will protect government revenues, ensure continuity of services, secure existing investments and maintain/restore investor confidence in the sector".
More so, since "conducting auctions in an environment of spectrum shortage, has serious implications on investments, predatory pricing, continuity of services and most importantly, on public interest," the chief executives added in their letter.
Besides these suggestions, the letter also proposed an alternate action plan, in case spectrum supply constraints prove a long-term challenge for the government.
If it takes too long to resolve the bandwidth supply constraints, the "government can auction all 900 MHz spectrum allocated to the 1996-2000 licensees together when state-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam's permits come up for renewal," the letter said.
In its recent spectrum pricing recommendations, Trai had warned that failure to add airwaves across bands to the auction pool would trigger an artificial scarcity and lead to fierce bidding by players desperate to win back their airwaves, which are being offered for sale as their permits expire in 2015-16. Such a scenario, it had warned, would add to the industry's indebtedness, which is already reeling under a burden of over Rs 2 lakh crore.
In an accompanying note on business risks being faced by the four operators, the chief executives warned about the likelihood of "business disruptions, including potential closure in the 11 circles" where permits are due for extension in 2015-16," in the event operators failed to win back expensive spectrum in the 900 MHz band.
The government is scheduled to auction a total of 104 units of airwaves in the 1800 MHz band and 184 units in the 900 MHz band next February. Trai has suggested a base price of Rs 2,138 crore per unit of 1800 MHz spectrum for 20 circles, about 10% higher than the reserve price fixed for the February 2014 auctions. In the 900 MHz band, the base price for 18 circles adds up to Rs 3,004 crore, which is 1.5 times the price of 1800 MHz.

MUMBAI: American cult bike maker Harley-Davidson today expanded its portfolio in the country by launching three new bikes including the hand-crafted CVO Limited, priced at Rs 49.23 lakh (ex-showroom New Delhi).
With the launch of the three new models - Breakout, which is priced at Rs 16.28 lakh and the Street Glide Special, priced at Rs 29.70 lakh, Harley Davidson India now has a product line-up of 13 models in the domestic market, Harley-Davidson Managing Director Anoop Prakash said here.
"Motorcycles launched today have always had an incredibly passionate following here. These latest offerings demonstrate Harley Davidson's commitment to delivering a world-class product that caters to our customers," he said.
Of the three new models, 'Breakout' would be assembled at the company's Bawal manufacturing facility in Haryana, while two of its other models namely the 'Street Glide Special' and the CVO, would be imported as completely built units, he said.
Presently, Harley-Davidson manufactures Street 750 at its Bawal plant, which is also exported to other markets, while nine other models are assembled and rest three models are imported, Prakash said.
Sounding bullish on the market, Prakash said that Harley-Davisdon has seen double digit growth in volumes, which is primarily driven by new aspiring customers and new product launches.
He said the company plans to set up two more dealerships, one each in Bangalore and Surat by this year end, which would take its total number of outlets to 17.
He said the company may look at making a foray into some tier-2 cities by next year.
Harley-Davidson would add hundreds of new genuine motor parts and accessories like jackets, boots, helmets, shirts etc to the shopping cart this year, he said.

Wal-Mart tests matching prices with online r...Amazon.com
(Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is…)
NEW YORK: Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is considering matching online prices from competitors such as Amazon.com , raising the stakes for the holiday shopping season.
The world's largest retailer, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, has matched prices of local store competitors but has not followed other retailers including Best Buy and Target in matching prices of online rivals. But last month, Wal-Mart started to test the strategy in five markets: Atlanta; Charlotte, North Carolina; Dallas; Phoenix; and northwest Arkansas.
The move was first reported by The Wall Street Journal on Thursday.
Wal-Mart is trying to rev up sluggish sales in the U.S. as it battles competition from online retailers, dollar stores and drugstores. At the same time, it's also dealing with a slowly recovering economy that hasn't benefited its low-income shoppers. As a result, Wal-Mart's U.S. namesake stores, which account for 60 percent of its total business, haven't reported growth in a key sales measure in six straight quarters.
But matching prices from sellers that don't have the costs associated with running brick-and-mortar stores could also hurt profits.
Wal-Mart's move underscores how stores are being forced to step up their game for the holiday shopping season, which accounts for about 20 percent of retail industry's annual sales. The National Retail Federation, the nation's largest retail trade group, forecasts a 4.1 percent sales increase to $616.9 billion for November and December from last year. But online sales, which are included in the forecast, are expected to increase anywhere from 8 percent to 11 percent.
Overall, stores need to ply shoppers with deals and free shipping to win their money. Target Corp. announced this month that it's offering free shipping on all items for the holiday season until Dec. 20.
As for Wal-Mart's price-matching policy, Deisha Barnett, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman, says many store managers have matched online prices for customers on a case-by-case basis.
``Taking care of the customers who shop our stores is what we always aim to do,'' she added.
Wal-Mart has been trying to reclaim its role as the low price leader. This year, it rolled out an online tool called Savings Catcher that compares prices on thousands of products with those of some of its store competitors. If the tool finds a lower price elsewhere, it refunds the difference to shoppers in the form of a store credit. That's different from traditional pricing matching because Savings Catcher does the work for the customer.
Wal-Mart told investors earlier this month that since the national launch in August, it's had more than 5 million people using the tool and almost 3 percent of all receipts are submitted through the application.
Wal-Mart has matched advertised prices from competitors' physical stores for several years. In 2011, it simplified the policy by making sure workers have the advertised prices of competitors on hand at the register, eliminating the need for shoppers to bring in an ad from a rival store.

India key to doubling revenue in Asia-Pac: B...Bosch Group
(Stuttgart-based Bosch,…)
BANGALORE: Betting big on India's auto industry, German components major Bosch expects the country to be a key growth driver in its bid to double business in the Asia Pacific region by 2020.
The Stuttgart-based firm, which posted a turnover of 46.1 billion euro in 2013, had 24 per cent of the revenue coming from the Asia Pacific region.
Bosch expects India's GDP to grow by 6 per cent next year with a projected growth of 4.8 per cent this year. It sees the country becoming the world's 5th largest vehicle manufacturer by the end of this decade.
"This makes the country one of the global engines of growth alongside China," Bosch Board of Management Chairman Volkmar Denner said.
According to the data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers , domestic car sales in FY'14 stood at 17,86,899 units as compared to 18,74,055 units in the previous fiscal.
The German firm, which reported a turnover of around Rs 13,200 crore in India last year, sees India as a key pillar of its growth strategy in the Asia Pacific.
"Over the past ten years, Bosch has doubled its sales in Asia Pacific. By 2020, we are aiming to double our sales in the region again," he added.
Highlighting the significance of the Indian market in the process, Denner said: "As the world's third biggest economy in terms of purchasing power, India has an important role to play in fulfilling this target."
"The economic indicators give us much cause of optimism - especially after the recent elections. We believe that the new government is poised to accelerate economic growth and introduce strategic reforms," Denner said.
Bosch, which has ten manufacturing facilities in the country and seven R&D centres, has been active in the Indian subcontinent since 1922.
Since 2010, the Bosch Group has invested around Rs 5,400 crore in the expansion of manufacturing and research facilities in the country, of which nearly Rs 1,200 crore were invested in the current year alone.
"This money has been used to establish new production plants and to expand research and development centres," Denner said, adding that the company currently employs more than 27,000 associates in India.
"The number has doubled within five years and is expected to grow further. This also reflects our firm belief in the country's growth potential and our commitment to this region," Denner said.
The Bosch group manufactures power tools, industrial machinery and home appliances, apart from auto components in India.

(SEBI moved SC seeking…)
NEW DELHI: Market regulator SEBI today moved the Supreme Court seeking its direction to Sahara group to give a time schedule for payment of Rs 47,000 crore to it as directed by the court.
In an application, SEBI submitted that the group be directed to furnish all details before the court regarding offers it received for its three luxury hotels in New York and London which was put on sale to raise money to be deposited with it to ensure bail for its chief Subrata Roy who has been in jail for around eight months.
The apex court had earlier allowed Roy, 65, to use the conference room in Tihar jail complex to hold negotiations with potential buyers for selling the hotels Dream Downtown and The Plaza in New York and Grosvenor House in London.
SEBI also submitted that court should pass order for selling off Sahara's properties to raise the amount.
The apex court had on August 1 allowed Roy and two directors of his group to use the conference room in Tihar jail complex for 10 days from August 5 to hold negotiations with potential buyers. The time period was further extended for 15 days on August 14. They got 15 more working days on September 8 to finish their task.
The apex court had earlier refused to release Roy on interim bail or parole but had allowed selling of his luxury hotels.
Roy, who was sent to jail on March 4 this year for non- refund of over Rs 20,000 crore with interest to depositors, was asked by the court to pay Rs 10,000 crore to get bail, out of which Rs 5,000 crore in cash and rest of the amount in bank guarantee.
Sahara has raised Rs 3,117 crore which has been deposited with SEBI.
The group, however, has been claiming that it has already repaid money to 93 per cent investors.

(Nilofar is unlikely to cause…)
NEW DELHI: Cyclone Nilofar is unlikely to cause any major damage, as weather officials expect it to weaken considerably as it approaches land. It is expected to make landfall Friday evening, with wind speeds of 40-50 kmph, gusting to 60 kmph.
The cyclone was earlier predicted to pack winds with speeds of 100-110 kmph at the time of landfall in Gujarat's Kutch district. The state government had started shifting people from the coastal areas to avoid calamities.
On Thursday, the storm was about 560 km southwest of Naliya in Gujarat. It would move northeastwards and weaken into a depression over northeast Arabian Sea off north Gujarat coast by Friday evening, the India Meteorological Department saida.
Gujarat's Kutch and Saurashtra districts are expected to get heavy rainfall over the next two days. Light rainfall would occur at many places in Gujarat and Rajasthan during the period, the department said.

Wall Street flat after GDP  but Visa lifts DowWall Street up on GDP, earnings; fund year-end lifts winners

US stocks were mostly flat, as a strong read on third-quarter economic growth raised new questions about monetary policy.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW YORK: US stocks rallied on Thursday, boosted by a strong reading on quarterly economic growth and on the back of upbeat earnings reports including Visa, which accounted for nearly 150 points in the Dow industrials.
Gains on the S&P 500 were led by the year's best performing sectors, healthcare and utilities. Analysts cited buying of winning stocks from mutual funds for the run in those sectors, as funds close their books for the year at the end of this month.
"End of year for mutual funds is most likely going to be selling losers and continue to buy winners," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.
Gross domestic product grew at a 3.5 per cent annual rate in the third quarter, beating expectations. A separate report showed first-time applications for unemployment benefits rose marginally last week, but a measure of underlying trends hit its lowest level since May 2000 in a show of labor market strength.
Adding to support from earnings and economic data, market participants cited a report from the Nikkei newspaper that confirmed expectations that Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund, the world's largest public pension, would cut holdings of Japanese bonds and add to equities.
The iShares MSCI Japan ETF gained 1.1 per cent and U.S. dollar denominated Nikkei futures gained 1.3 percent.
"The more you hear demand for equities picking up globally, that is going to be a net positive for U.S. equities," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.
"If you look globally, growth is here in the United States," she said.
At 2:49 p.m. EDT (1829 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average rose 211.13 points, or 1.24 per cent, to 17,185.44, the S&P 500 gained 10.11 points, or 0.51 per cent, to 1,992.41 and the Nasdaq Composite added 10.78 points, or 0.24 per cent, to 4,560.01.
Visa Inc jumped 11.1 percent to $238.49 as the biggest boost to both the Dow and S&P 500 a day after it reported adjusted earnings that topped expectations, and said the mobile payment industry would be "a great driver" for business.
MasterCard Inc also posted a better-than-expected profit, while revenue was up almost 13 per cent.

 Rupee Falls to 61.45/Dollar on Fed s Hawkish StanceRupee Ends Higher at 61.88 After RBI Policy Review
Mumbai: The rupee hit a two-week low on Thursday, falling for a third consecutive session as the dollar got a boost after the US Federal Reserve struck a more hawkish tone than expected at its policy meeting.
The partially convertible rupee closed at 61.45/46 per dollar, weaker from Wednesday's 61.35/36. Intraday, it fell to as low as 61.55 per dollar, a level last seen on October 17.
The dollar climbed to its highest in more than three weeks against a basket of currencies, after the Fed underscored the improving US labour market, raising concerns it may raise interest rates earlier than expected.
However, broader losses in the rupee were capped as domestic shares rose to record highs, raising hopes of continued foreign inflows. Custodian banks were also seen selling dollars through the session.
Analysts also cited government measures on Wednesday relaxing rules for foreign investment in the construction sector as another positive for the rupee.
"Overall sentiment on rupee is still positive because flows continue towards India, and I think India will be the favourite destination among EMs (emerging markets)," said Hari Chandramgethen, head of foreign exchange trading at South Indian Bank.
"I expect a trading range of 60 to 62 (per dollar) for the rupee in the near term."
Analysts expect the rupee to be resilient, given investors are already starting to price in potential US rate hikes, although much could depend on continued government reforms.
Moody's welcomed recent efforts by the government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to boost economic growth and attract long-term investments, but said the measures would need to be sustained to have an actual impact on sovereign ratings.
In the offshore non-deliverable forwards, the one-month contract was at 61.69/79, while the three-month contract was at 62.29/39.

 Bonds Touch 13-Month Highs on Rate Cut HopesIVRCL Allots First Tranche of Shares to CDR Lenders
The government bonds hit a 13-month high Thursday on hopes recent government reforms and likely rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) would help offset any impact of an earlier-than-expected increase in US interest rates.
The gains came on a day when shares bucked other emerging markets to touch a record high after the US Federal Reserve ended its massive bond-buying programme on Wednesday, but laced its economic assessment with a tinge of hawkishness.
Some analysts however said the bond market rally may have come a little too soon as the RBI is expected to retain key rates at its next policy review on December 2.
Credit ratings agency Moody's Investors Service welcomed recent efforts by the government and its central bank to boost economic growth and attract long-term investments, but said the measures would need to be sustained to have an actual impact on sovereign ratings.
"There are fears in some quarters that the current rally may have been over-done because RBI is still in wait-and-watch mode," said Ganti Murthy, head of fixed income at IDBI Asset Management in Mumbai.
The benchmark 10-year bond yield ended at 8.29 per cent against its close of 8.32 per cent on Wednesday.
The yield dropped to as low as 8.28 per cent in choppy intraday trade, a level last seen in August 2013, after hitting a high of 8.34 per cent.
The yield on the 10-year benchmark has fallen 22 basis points since October 1, helped by continued buying by foreign investors, easing inflation, and a slump in global crude prices.
India's five-year swap rate ended flat at 7.50 per cent, while the one-year rate rose 2 basis points to 8.10 per cent.

CPI(M) Polit Bureau told to rework draft policyCPI(M) Polit Bureau told to rework draft policy
Our Bureau
Making a point CPI(M) general secretary Prakash Karat at a press conference in New Delhi on Wednesday. PTI
Is Karat-Yechury turf war out in the open?
New Delhi, October 29:  
Ahead of the party’s 21st congress scheduled for April 2015 in Visakhapatnam, the CPI(M) has started a serious debate on its future course. Party general secretary Prakash Karat and Polit Bureau members had to beat a hasty retreat as more than 70 per cent of the party members opposed a draft political resolution and political line moved by the Polit Bureau in the Central Committee.
The Central Committee, at a four-day meeting here, also discussed two separate notes from Polit Bureau members Sitaram Yechury and BV Raghavulu on the resolution.
“The Central Committee discussed the draft review report of the political-tactical line of the party.
“This review was undertaken in order to identify any weaknesses or shortcomings which need to be corrected to ensure the growth of the independent strength of the party and to be able to advance the struggle for a Left and democratic front,” a CPI(M) statement said.
It added that after the discussions, the Central Committee authorised the Polit Bureau to present a revised draft on the lines suggested by the Polit Bureau for approval in the next meeting of the Central Committee, scheduled for January.
“The next Central Committee meeting in January will adopt the draft political resolution and both these documents will be released for discussions within the party in the run-up to the 21st congress,” the statement added.
When asked at a press conference here whether the differences are a result of the alleged turf war between him and Yechury, Karat said the process is part of internal deliberations within the CPI(M). “Everyone in the party has full freedom to put forth their views and get them debated,” he added.
To hold plenum
The Central Committee has also decided to hold a plenum on organisation after the party congress on the basis of the guidelines to be decided by the congress. Karat said the main discussion on the party organisation will be held in the plenum.
A source in the CPI(M) said the decision to hold a plenum was taken despite objections from a section of the party leaders. They had demanded that rather than taking the traditional route, the CPI(M) has to overhaul the organisation in order to attract the youth and fight the imminent “threat” of the Sangh Parivar. Both in West Bengal and Kerala, the BJP had improved its vote share in the lok Sabha elections.
There are also interpretations that the discussion on the new tactical line is a result of the turf war between Karat and Yechury. Yechury is tipped to succeed Karat as general secretary at the Visakhapatnam meet.
Senior Polit Bureau members S Ramachandran Pillai and Raghavulu are also considered contenders for the top post.

Assembly polls: J-K police launches crackdown against separatists after boycott callPrint
Written by Ruwa Shah | Srinagar | Posted: October 30, 2014 6:54 pm
Ahead of the Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir, police have started a spree of arrests against the separatists. From past two days, senior separatist leaders, Nayeem Khan, Shabir Ahmad Shah, Ayaz Akbar and JKLF Chairman Yasin Malik have been detained by the police.
The crackdowns on the separatist leaders have been launched as they have given a call for poll boycott. The assembly elections will be held in the state in five phases and separatist leaders have decided to launch anti-poll campaign across the state.
In the last two days, teams of J&K Police have raided the residences of all Hurriyat members and detained 10 activists associated with Hurriyat Conference led by Syed Ali Geelani.
The police have also detained leaders and activists of various separatist organizations in many districts. Sources said that more arrests would be made in the coming days.
Terming the arrests and the conduct of elections as “inhumane”, hard-line separatist leader Syed Ali Geelani said that it is an anti-people move by the state.
“The conduct of election in the time when people need to be rehabilitated is an inhuman approach. All the relief operations that are important in these times will be hampered by this step,” he said.
Geelani said the state is keeping the administration busy in the election process so as to stop the relief distribution work in the flood-hit state. “Conducting election this time will only make people suffer more,” he said.
Meanwhile, following the arrest of Malik clashes between police and supporters of JKLF broke out in Maisuma locality.

Expert claims hacking Xiaomi server  firm calls ithoaxA Taiwanese cyber security expert has claimed to have compromised server.
By: PTI | New Delhi | Posted: October 30, 2014 9:18 pm | Updated: October 31, 2014 3:47 pm
A Taiwanese cyber security expert has claimed to have compromised server of China based smartphone maker Xiaomi but the company called it a hoax.
“Chen Huang is an independent Taiwanese Security Expert. Session Abstract: In this session Taiwanese Researcher will demonstrate how Xiaomi Phones have been sending device data and personal data of Xiaomi Phone user to Chinese Servers,” said the website of Ground Zero Summit.
“The Researcher will also release Server Logs, Mi Account username, Emails and passwords of millions of Xiaomi users which have been obtained using a Zero Day flaw in the Xiaomi Servers,” the webpage added.
Xiaomi is now world’s third largest smartphone maker after Samsung and Apple, as per the latest IDC report.
When contacted, Xiaomi’ Head of India Operations Manu Jain said: “We have verified that the zero-day data breach allegation made by security researcher Chen Huang and the Ground Zero Summit organising committee reported by The Hacker News on October 30, 2014 is a hoax.”
Jain said that the zero-day vulnerability reported by the cyber security researcher Chen Huang is a deliberate falsehood and Xiaomi is taking the necessary legal action against the parties involved.
Jain in his reply admitted that the company’s user account file was leaked in May this year.
“To date, throughout Xiaomi’s history, there has only been one incident in which a two-year-old user account file was leaked in May 2014,” Jain said.
He said that leaked information was from user accounts registered before August 2012 in an old version of the Xiaomi user forum website.
Meanwhile, organisers of the summit, which is to be held here next month, said that they have put Cheng’s session on hold till the time Xiaomi completes its investigations.
“Xiaomi representatives contacted and requested us regarding the session. We have decided to withhold session till the time Xiaomi investigates data breach and accusations and works with the researcher to fix it,” Indian Infosec Consortium CEO Jiten Jain said.
The summit’s website shows former chief of Indian Army and Minister of State for Development of North Eastern Region General VK Singh, Home Ministry Joint Secretary Nirmaljeet Singh Kalsi, Enforcement Directorate Special Director Karnail Singh and NTRO Director of Cyber Security Operations Alok Vijayant will be among key speakers.
Xiaomi entered the Indian market in July through tie-up with e-Commerce major Flipkart. It is estimated that the firm has sold over 1.5 million devices so far.

SBT net dips 65% as higher NPA provisioning bitesSBT net dips 65% as higher NPA provisioning bites

Thiruvananthapuram, October 30:  
State Bank of Travancore reported a 65.34 per cent dip in net profit in the September quarter from year-ago levels. But a reasonably good performance on expenditure control was neutralised by muted income.
The bank took cues from an RBI circular of 2001 to show provisions specifically against non-performing assets (NPAs) separated from the more general ‘provisions and contingencies’.
This is an effort aimed at providing greater transparency about the financial results, a top bank official told BusinessLine.
Not many public sector banks seem to have paid attention to this circular which is why this does not show up in their books.
Provisions against NPAs jumped 105 per cent during the quarter even as the bank was following these up with a tracking mechanism.

JLR plant will create 1 400 jobsJLR plant will create 1,400 jobs
Vidya Ram
Diesel engine production will begin in Jan
London, October 30:  
Jaguar Land Rover’s new engine manufacturing plant in the UK will create 1,400 jobs when it reaches full capacity.
The £500-million Engine Manufacturing Centre near the central English city of Wolverhampton, opened on Thursday, will initially employ around 300 people.
The figure will rise to 600 by the following year and 1,400 by the time it reaches full capacity.
In addition, it could lead to 5,500 jobs in the supply chain. The facility will also be supported by 2,000 JLR powertrain engineers.
Around 30 per cent of its 71 suppliers are based in the UK, with the rest based largely in continental Europe.
The plant itself lies between the company's three other manufacturing sites at Halewood, Castle Bromwich and Solihull, and is in an area with a long-standing automotive industry.
Production of the diesel engine at the plant will begin in January, with the first Jaguar XE—the company’s mid-sized executive “attainable” car—using the in-house engine rolling off the production line in the Spring.
The plant will begin producing the petrol version of the same engine in 2016.
Setting up an engine plant will allow JLR to tune them to the company’s specific needs, creating light-weight, efficient and powerful engines emitting minimal carbon dioxide. (The company estimates the first engine weigh 24 kg less than the one it replaces).
“Our goal is to transform the way engines are manufactured and to be recognised as the benchmark for excellence in manufacturing,” said Trevor Leeks, plant operations director at a presentation.
Till now, JLR had sourced its four cylinder diesel engines from a joint venture in France and Spain with Peugeot Citroen and Ford.
JLR will continue to source other engines such as the powerful V6 and V8 from Ford, and has said it remains committed to maintaining its relationship with the automaker for petrol and diesel engines in the long term.
JLR recently opened its first overseas factory in Changshu, China, in a joint venture with Chinese automaker Chery. It has a capacity to produce 130,000 cars a year.
Another factory in Brazil is set to start delivering cars by 2016 with a capacity of 24,000 cars a year. It has an assembly plant in Pune.

Black money: After rap  Govt to come clean to court todayWe will not modify our order, apex court tells Attorney-General
New Delhi, October 28:  
The Supreme Court on Tuesday slammed the Centre for protecting persons having black money abroad. It ordered the Centre to disclose all the names of such account holders in a sealed cover by Wednesday.
A three-judge Bench comprising Chief Justice of India HL Dattu and Justices Ranjana Desai and Madan B Lokur rejected the argument of Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi for modification of the order directing disclosure of all names.
The CJI told the Attorney General: “Don’t tell us to modify our order. We will not modify or change even a word in our order. Give us all information you received from foreign countries and we will decide the course of the probe. Why are you providing a protective umbrella to foreign bank account holders? You do not have to take interest in people having foreign bank accounts. The SIT will take care of it. You need not take the trouble of conducting any investigation. We will decide whether to order a CBI or an Income Tax probe or entrust the probe to some other agency. We can’t leave the issue of bringing back black money to the government. It will never happen during our time. We will do it.”
Making it clear that a new regime at the Centre could not ask for modification of the order after five months when it was passed in an open court and accepted by the Centre, the CJI said: “We share the concern of the petitioner, senior advocate Ram Jethmalani, who is only an informer. He only wants to bring back black money stashed abroad. You do not do anything. Just pass on the information of account holders you have received from Germany, France and Switzerland to us and we will pass an order for a further probe.”
The court’s direction came a day after the NDA Government released eight names against whom it had started prosecution for allegedly stashing black money in foreign banks. Following this, the Supreme Court also questioned the Centre as to why it was providing a protective umbrella to foreign bank account holders.
At the outset the AG told the court: “We (the Centre) are not interested in hiding any information from the court. This Government constituted the SIT at the first instance and had already passed on the names we have received from foreign banks. Unless we give a declaration of confidentiality we can’t sign the agreement in December. What we are saying is we will disclose those names against whom investigation is completed and prosecution is launched.”
The CJI said: “You are now trying to reargue the case, which is impermissible. You first give us all the names in a sealed cover by tomorrow and we will tell you what you should do.”
The Bench posted the matter for further hearing on Wednesday.

NRI deposits fall on US rate hike expectationsNRI deposits fall on US rate hike expectations
Radhika Merwin
Also, a stable rupee has reduced the scope for arbitrage
October 29, 2014:  
A possible interest rate hike by the US and a stable rupee have resulted in Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) parking lesser amounts in Indian banks as deposits. According to the latest RBI data, NRIs deposited $7.1 billion during April-August this year, 13 per cent lower than the amount they brought in during the same period last year.
The Non-Resident (External) Rupee Account (NRE) has particularly been hit on growing expectations of a rate hike by the US, which could make such deposits less attractive. Inflows into NRE deposits fell by 35 per cent during April-August.
NRE deposits have been an attractive option for non-residents due to higher rates, tax-free interest and absence of any restrictions on repatriation of funds. In 2012-13, for instance, NRE deposits jumped 46 per cent, thanks to RBI’s high interest rate regime.
Less arbitrage opportunity
Globally, interest rates have been low. But with a possible rate hike in the US over the next one year or so, the rate differential between US and India may narrow.
Along with interest rates, rupee movement also has a major bearing on inflows. In the case of NRE accounts, where deposits are maintained in rupees, appreciation of the rupee against a foreign currency benefits depositors. This is because a stronger rupee will ensure higher amounts are remitted to their country on conversion. With the rupee hovering at 60-61 levels for a while now, arbitrage opportunity is low.
Shyam Srinivasan, MD and CEO, Federal Bank, says that it is the arbitrage market within non-resident (NR) remittances that has shrunk this year. Federal Bank, which has a strong foothold in the NR segment, has 8 per cent market share pan-India and more than a third in Kerala, which is the largest market for remittances.
“The NR remittance market is divided into conventional, arbitrage and investor segments. The conventional market, where a person sends money home to his family, is 70-75 per cent of the remittance market. This market is not impacted by the volatility in the rupee or rate cycle.
“It is the other 15 per cent of the market that is driven by arbitrage opportunity. Here, a person borrows money cheap elsewhere, sends it to India and then makes use of the high interest rates. When the rupee strengthens, he pulls out the money,” says Srinivasan.
The investor segment is driven by sentiment. While foreign investors have been pouring money into India, individual investment in real estate or businesses is waiting on the sidelines for the economy to pick up, he notes.
One-time bump up
Foreign Currency Non-Resident (FCNR) accounts as a category has lost its charm, as rates are much lower, with the ceiling set by the RBI on the basis of Libor/swap rates. Money in these accounts can be held in foreign currency and hence depositors will gain on depreciation of the rupee.
Last year, the RBI opened a special window for swapping FCNR deposits mobilised by banks. By subsidising the swap cost, the RBI made it more attractive for banks to channel funds through this route. It was also a win-win situation for both banks and the depositor. This was because banks offered a leveraged product under this scheme. This was essentially extending an overdraft to the NRI depositor, with a lien on his deposit.
FCNR deposits in 2013-14, went up by $26 billion. This year until August, only $1.5 billion of inflows have come into FCNR deposits.

A to Z of the two best compact smarties of today: Sony Xperia Z3 Compact and Samsung Galaxy AlphaThey’re small, but are big on features. Sabyasachi Biswas pitches the two best compact Android smartphones against each other
October 29, 2014:  
Sony Xperia Z3 Compact – Small fish, big bite
It shouldn’t be difficult to guess why we decided to go for the fish reference – the Z3 Compact can handle anything from a downpour to a whole swimming pool! Since it’s the flagship series’ compact offshoot, it gets the same IP68 certified dust and water protection as the bigger models. In the real world scenario, this can be very handy if you’re caught out in the downpour and don’t have a water-proof bag or pouch to drop all your gadgets in (as we’ve learned the hard way). Sure, it doesn’t get the metal accents as the bigger Z3, but the Z3 Compact’s polycarbonate casing, with glass front and back panels, does look good. It comes with rounded edges which are specially designed to absorb the energy, should you drop your phone off the table and on to its edges. The design and build of the Z3 Compact make it a phone apt for those who like the outdoors.
And the phone’s camera also complements its nature. The 20.7MP rear-facing camera is the same as the flagship’s and it is absolutely brilliant. The optics are just outstanding, and the colour reproduction is spot-on. Video recording too is great with 4K support.
We would recommend this phone for someone with a very active, outdoorsy lifestyle, and loves clicking pictures. The Z3 Compact is a complete package, with a great camera, amazing battery life, butter-smooth performance and obviously, Sony’s usual multimedia brilliance and PS4 compatibility. It’s a very lively phone, this one. Our only complaint with the Z3 Compact is that the glass body is a smudge and scratch magnet.
Love – Brilliant camera; Long battery life; Water and dust protection
Hate – Glass back attracts scratches; Plastic frame
Samsung Galaxy Alpha – Elegance in your palm
It took Samsung a lot of time to realize that freshness in design and a good build quality was much needed in the Galaxy lineup. And we’re glad they took it seriously, because the new Galaxy Alpha is simply the sexiest smartphone Samsung has produced, in our opinion. Wrapped in a brushed metal frame, this smartphone comes in a very sleek and extremely ergonomic package. We won’t deny it – we did show the phone off a little bit. While the profile makes it into any pocket comfortably, you’d love carrying this elegant piece of technology in your palm most of the times.
And inside this sleek package is the multi-tasking workhorse that Samsung has created with an octa-core processor and features like Multi-Window, Smart Stay and the usual gamut of Samsung features. This phone is clearly meant for those who love balancing work and personal lives, because while the phone offers enough power to see through the utility apps, it does justice to multimedia too, with a brilliant Super AMOLED display. Whether it’s making a presentation or browsing through your holiday photos, this phone can handle it all. Only, the speakers that come with the gorgeous screen aren’t too great.
You can easily squeeze out one work day’s worth of juice from the Galaxy Alpha, but definitely not more. On the upside, the Galaxy Alpha comes with a heart-rate sensor for the health apps and a fingerprint sensor for security. In our opinion, the Galaxy Alpha is a well balanced package, for those who would like versatility in their phones.
Love – Gorgeous design; Multitasking capabilities; Bright display
Hate – Average battery life; No expandable memory; Speakers

Cabinet relaxes norms for FDI in constructionCabinet relaxes norms for FDI in construction
Our Bureau
Eases minimum area rule and minimum capital requirement
New Delhi, October 29:  
The Cabinet has relaxed norms for foreign direct investment (FDI) in construction development to make the sector more attractive for overseas investors.
The minimum built-up area requirement for FDI in construction projects has been reduced from 50,000 sq metres to 20,000 sq metres, according to an official release.
The Government has also halved the minimum capital requirement for such projects from $10 million to $5 million.
Projects that commit at least 30 per cent of the total project cost toward low-cost affordable housing will be exempted from the minimum built-up area and capitalisation requirements.
Land use norms
However, there has been no relaxation in land-use norms.
The previous UPA Government was examining the option of allowing Indian companies with foreign investments to buy agricultural land with a promise to change it into non-agriculture use later.
Last month, the BJP-led Government relaxed FDI norms for the railways sector. “The announcement has come in the nick of time. The construction sector’s share in total FDI has slipped from over 20 per cent in 2009-10 to about 3 per cent this year, as developers reel under high levels of debt,” said Anuj Puri, Chairman & Country Head, JLL India.
The easier rules will help speed up completion of projects, which are being delayed by a squeeze on funds due to elevated debt levels, he added.
In the case of development of serviced plots, there is no condition of minimum land area.
The existing FDI policy allows 100 per cent foreign direct investment in the construction sector subject to minimum built-up area and minimum capitalisation requirements.
Exit option
According to the new rules, an investor will be permitted to exit on completion of the project or three years after the date of final investment, subject to development of trunk infrastructure.
The Government may permit repatriation of foreign investment or transfer of stake by one non-resident investor to another non-resident investor before the completion of the project.
These proposals will be considered by the Foreign Investment Promotion Board on a case by case basis.

Slips to 142nd place in Doing Business Index; is 7th in shareholder protection
New Delhi, October 29:  
While India’s record in protecting minority shareholders has improved, it has slipped two places in the Doing Business index.
According to a report by the World Bank Group and released on Tuesday in Washington, India ranks 142, while Singapore remains the best place to do business.
India was originally 134 in the group of 189 countries, but in 2014 fell to the 140th place in the revised ranking.
But in terms of protecting minority shareholders, India is in the top 50 nations in two categories: protecting minority shareholders and credit availability. It moved up to the seventh rank from 21 in terms of protecting minority shareholders, ahead of countries such as the US, Japan, France and Germany in a list topped by New Zealand.
However, India has dropped to the 36th place in the ranking from 30th in credit availability.
“India strengthened minority investor protections by requiring greater disclosure of conflicts of interest by board members, increasing the remedies available in case of prejudicial related party transactions and introducing additional safeguards for shareholders of privately held companies,” it said. The World Bank report on Doing Business highlighted key issues for India including starting a business and getting electricity.
Though, the report appreciated that India made starting a business easier by considerably reducing the registration fees, it also made it difficult by introducing a requirement to file a declaration before the commencement of business operations. These changes apply to both Delhi and Mumbai. In terms of getting electricity, the report said that the utility in Mumbai made getting electricity less costly by reducing the security deposit for a new connection.
Govt target
The Modi regime aims to put India among the top 50 nations for ease of doing business. Accordingly, it is going for key reforms, including in the labour sector. However, they will take some time to reflect on performance.
CII reaction
Commenting on the report, Chandrajit Banerjee, Director-General of the Confederation of Indian Industry, said that in spite of the drop in ranking, India’s performance has improved over the last year.
“However, the performance of the other countries has been better and therefore, India has dropped in ranking in spite of an improved performance score. However, more importantly, the actions taken by the new Government have not been factored in the report as the data has been analysed till June 2014,” he said.

Nilofar may weaken as depression near Gujarat coast: India MetNilofar may weaken as depression near Gujarat coast: India Met
Vinson Kurian
Tweet
Thiruvananthapuram, Oct 30:  
Very severe cyclone Nilofar is expected to weaken a round as a severe cyclone during the course of the day and continue to weaken on the way to Gujarat coast.
India Met Department now expects that it would weaken three times over and become a depression near the coast by Friday night/Saturday morning.
Speed breakers
Earlier, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts had said that Nilofar was running into a series of speed breakers along the home stretch.
The main one is the overarching western disturbance that caused the cyclone to divert course mid-way towards Gujarat.
The high winds from the disturbance in the upper levels are shearing away the top of the storm tower and dispersing the clouds, compromising its strength and structure.
The westerly winds will continue to nibble away at the thunder cloud formation around the storm structure even as it is dragged towards the coast.
Threat off
In this manner, the threat to the Gujarat coast posed by the erstwhile very severe cyclone that briefly rivalled the peak strength of cyclone Hudhud, has blown away.
In fact, the European Centre suspects that the storm could die out over the sea itself.
If one were to extrapolate the India Met Department assessment, it could become a conventional low-pressure area at the time of landfall.
Moderate showers
The Met has forecast only moderate showers over north Gujarat with isolated heavy falls over Kutch and Saurashtra districts and the north Gujarat region.
Squally weather will prevail over the Gujarat coast on Friday. Sea condition will be rough to very rough during this period.

Sensex surges 248 points to end at new high of 27 346; Nifty gains 79 pointsSensex surges 248 points to end at new high of 27,346; Nifty gains 79 points

Mumbai, Oct 30:  
Led by the recent economic reforms announced by the government, the benchmark BSE Sensex surged 248.16 points to end at a new closing peak of 27,346.33 and the NSE index Nifty rose 78.75 points at 8,169.20.
Domestic sentiment was buoyed on increased buying by investors as the recent economic reforms have instilled confidence that the country can better withstand potential rate hikes in the US.
Sectoral indices
All BSE sectoral indices ended in the green. Among them, realty index was the star-performer and was up 3.44 per cent, followed by IT 2.04 per cent, TECk 1.77 per cent and oil & gas 1.65 per cent.
Gainers, losers
Reliance, TCS, Hindalco, Infosys and GAIL were the top five gainers among 30-share Sensex constituents, while the top five losers were SSLT, M&M, Cipla, Tata Power and Hero MotoCorp.
FDI rules relaxed
Among the recent economic reforms, the Government had yesterday relaxed FDI rules in the construction sector by reducing the minimum built-up area as well as capital requirement and easing the exit norms. Sharess of realty companies, particularly those with high debt, such as Unitech, DLF and Puravankara climbed after the announcement.
Global markets
The dollar surged to a three-week high, bond yields rose and gold fell on Thursday after the US Federal Reserve ended its six-year quantitative easing bond-buying programme.
The decision was widely expected, but a relatively hawkish tone to the accompanying statement was not. It prompted financial markets to rethink the growing consensus that the Fed's first interest rate hike would be late in 2015.
Stock market reaction was more mixed. Asian shares mostly fell, following a slight decline on Wall Street overnight. European bourses opened higher on Thursday, helped by encouraging corporate earnings, but quickly turned negative.
Overnight borrowing costs
In a statement on Wednesday after a two-day meeting, the Fed retained its basic guidance that overnight borrowing costs would remain near zero for a "considerable time".
But it dropped a characterisation of the US labour market slack as "significant" in a show of confidence in the economy's prospects, which markets perceived as a slightly hawkish turn.
In early European trade the dollar index, a broad measure of the greenback's trade-weighted value, was up 0.5 percent above 86.4.
European equity markets initially welcomed the Fed's statement as a sign that the US economy is in good shape, rather than taking fright at the prospect of interest rates perhaps rising sooner than had been expected.
But at 0930 GMT the EuroFirst 300 index of leading shares was down 0.1 per cent at 1317 points. Germany's DAX was down 0.4 per cent and France's CAC40 was down 0.1 per cent, shrugging off upbeat corporate updates from Alcatel Lucent, Technip and Renault.
Britain's FTSE 100 was down 0.5 per cent, and U. futures pointed to Wall Street opening around 0.2 per cent lower.

Kaziranga reopens for tourists onSaturdayPrint
The 858-sq km national park had witnessed a record 1,25,911 tourists during 2013-14, of whom 6922 were foreign tourists.
Written by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati | Posted: October 30, 2014 9:57 pm | Updated: November 1, 2014 9:22 pm
Kaziranga National Park, home to the highest number of great one-horned rhinoceros, reopened for visitors on Saturday after a gap of six months, with the first batch of tourists to avail the elephant safari comprising visitors from Australia, the US and UK.
While state forest and environment minister Rakibul Hussain flagged off the first group of 30 tourists on 13 elephants at the Kohora range, 19 other elephants took 40 tourists into the Bagori range. Later in the, tourists also availed jeep safari, though through a limited route.
“The first day’s tourists could see nearly two dozen rhinos including several calves, while visitors also spotted herds of swamp deer, hog deer, water buffalo, elephants, langur, wild boar and birds,” said Park director MK Yadava.
The 858-sq km national park also has the highest density of Royal Bengal tigers in the world, but spotting a tiger was not easy on the first day on Saturday. The last census had put Kaziranga’s tiger population at 118.
Kaziranga, the most important tourist destination in Northeastern India had a record arrival of 1,25,911 tourists during 2013-14, of whom 6922 were foreign tourists, mostly from European countries and the US. The number of domestic tourists has registered a significant increase over the years, from 53,640 during 2007-08 to over 1.19 lakh in the last tourist season. Likewise, the number of foreign tourist has jumped from 3772 in 2003-04 to 6922 during 2013-14.
Recognized as the biggest conservation success story of the 20th century, relentless efforts put in by the authorities have witnessed the increase of one-horned rhino population in Kaziranga from just about 20 pairs in 1905 to 2329 animals as found in the census conducted in 2013.

BJP has no moral right to form government in Maharashtra:CongressPrint
By: Express News Service | Mumbai | Posted: October 30, 2014 9:57 pm | Updated: October 30, 2014 10:07 pm
Claiming that neither the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) nor the Shiv Sena have extended a letter of support to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Congress on Thursday said that the “BJP has no moral right to stake claim for government formation.”

Congress legislator and spokesperson Anant Gadgil said, “As neither party has extended a letter of support, the BJP is short of reaching the half way mark. It does not have the moral right to form a government.”
Chiding the BJP for departing from the official protocol of a swearing-in ceremony, the Congress also claimed that the “sanctity of a swearing in had been lost with the BJP converting an official occassion into an event.”
While former Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan said that he would be attending the event, party state chief Manikrao Thakre complained that he had not received an official invitation for the event. Thakre further said, “It is sad that the BJP has turned a state function into a party event. How can legislators of other parties attended such an event?,” he asked. While NCP chief Sharad Pawar is unlikely to attend the event too, NCP office bearers said that state leaders Ajit Pawar,
Sunil Tatkare, and RR Patil, among others will attend the event.
Earlier, former Congress Lok Sabha member Sanjay Nirupam tore into the BJP for making the oath-taking ceremony a grand affair. Alleging that Rs 100 crore were being spent for the occasion, Nirupam quipped, “Is this the swearing in of a Chief Minister or coronation of king? The amount of money being spent is obscene.”
Gadgil asked, “Who is footing the bill for the extravaganza?.” He added, “The same BJP that accused the Congress of corruption is now spending lavishly on an oath-taking ceremony,” he said. He also chided the BJP’s plans to use 25 boats along the Arabian Sea just off the Wankhe stadium to put up a giant cut out of a lotus in the sea. “It is another marketing gimmick,” he said.

Raj Thackeray to skip swearing-in ceremony  plans a fortnight long outreachprogrammeThackeray has claimed that he will prefer watching the function on television.

In an apparent attempt to position himself as important opposition figure, MNS president Raj Thackeray has decided to skip Devendra Fadnavis’ swearing -in ceremony on Friday and has instead decided to go to Javkhede village where three members of a Dalit family were killed.
READ:  Shiv Sena likely to skip Devendra Fadnavis’ swearing-in tomorrow
Thackeray has claimed that he will prefer watching the function on television. His associates have meanwhile claimed that he would leave for Ahmednagar via road on Friday morning and will visit the site of the murder on Saturday. Three members of a Dalit family were murdered and their bodies mutilated in Javkhede village in Ahmednagar district. Political leaders mainly from the opposition have been making a beeline to the village to demand action against perpetrators of the crime.
After a drubbing in the Maharashtra Assembly elections MNS President Raj Thackeray who had been lying low for the past fortnight has decided to reactivate his party machinery. He will also kick of a party outreach programme which will see him visit Kalyan Dombivali, Nashik, Aurangabad and Pimpri Chinchwad. The MNS was expected to get electoral returns from these areas however er all the candidates put up by the party suffered a loss. Thackeray will be taking a review of these constituencies and will also try to smoothen the ruffled feathers of many disgruntled party leaders and workers.
Thackeray has already started to speak about farmers issues. In an apparent attempt to strengthen his rural base Thackeray had on Wednesday written a letter to the Governor seeking increased price for sugar cane farmers.
Thackeray is trying to revive the MNS which floundered miserably in the Assembly elections winning only one seat. There is also dissension in his ranks with senior leaders like Pravin Darekar being unhappy with his style of functioning.
