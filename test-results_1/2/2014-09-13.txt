The  Real  Reason Starbucks Baristas Spell Your Name Wrong"My name is Bob," you tell the Starbucks barista.
But you aren't surprised when your cup comes back with the scribblings, "Bahwbuh."
That's because Starbucks baristas misspell customers names all the time.
But have you ever wondered why?
In this video from comedian Paul Gale , we are clued in to the meaningful and ultra powerful reason baristas spell your name wrong.
Hint: It's not because they misheard you, or because they don't know how to spell "Bob." No, sir. It's a little more messed up than that.

SFC personnel test-fires Agni-Idefence
Agni-I, a surface-to-surface, nuclear-weapons-capable ballistic missile, was test-fired for its 700-km strike range from the Wheeler Island, off the Odisha Coast, on Thursday.
Strategic Forces Command (SFC) personnel launched the single-stage, short-range missile, powered by a solid propellant, from a rail mobile launcher as part of regular user training to consolidate operational readiness.
The missile carrying a 1,100-kg payload zeroed in on the target with a high degree of accuracy, a missile scientist with the Defence Research and Development Organisation said. Describing it as a fantastic launch, he said the missile achieved a CEP (circular error probability) of about 50 metres. Its trajectory was tracked and monitored by sophisticated radars, telemetry observation stations, electro-optic instruments and naval ships through the 550-second flight.
The first night-trial of the missile was conducted in April.

Wal-Mart spurns Apple on payment systems3
CurrentC works on any smartphone, not just the iPhone, so it has a larger potential market. And when a shopper is ready to buy a product, the CurrentC app creates a type of bar code — called a QR code — that can be recognized by most checkout scanners today.
Apple Pay uses a chip that sends signals a short distance through the air using technology called near-field communication, or NFC. But only 10 percent of merchants have sensors that can read such signals, and such devices can cost about $500 to install. However, retailers have been ordered by credit card companies to upgrade their registers to models that probably will include NFC technology.
Apple's system allows users to load their credit and debit cards onto an iPhone. A consumer would merely need to hold the smartphone close to a NFC sensor and confirm the purchase with a fingerprint scan.
Apple has said that it has no interest in tracking the purchases shoppers make through Apple Pay. Company executives said this week that the details of any transaction would be known only by shoppers and their financial firms. CurrentC's organizers have not said whether retailers will track purchases made with their system, but many analysts expect them to do so. Many chains already track customers' shopping behavior through loyalty cards or even by monitoring how they move through store aisles.
James Wester, research director of global payments at IDC Financial Insights, said Apple's entrance into mobile payments will expand the market to the benefit of all involved. But he added that CurrentC has an edge because the money retailers are saving by cutting banks and credit card companies out of the equation will give them room to offer discounts, rewards or loyalty programs that could drive sales.
"Just because Apple is now responsible for us getting to this tipping point doesn't mean Apple is necessarily going to win," Wester said. "But Apple is really good at user experience and has loyal customers. . . . That's something you can't discount."
On the other hand, it's an open question whether consumers will trust either system with their most personal financial information. It's possible that neither will draw enough consumers toward a digital payment alternative that has had many fits and starts. Google and other companies have mobile wallet systems that have failed to gain traction.
"While these two platforms are big enablers, that does not automatically guarantee success. We still need to see whether consumers will find the value proposition enough to start using the system," said Rajesh Kandaswamy, a research director at Gartner, a technology research firm. "This pits powerful players against each other, but they are not the only ones."

Prominent legal scholars critique Obamas decision to wage war against ISIS without congressional authorizationBy Ilya Somin September 12
Several prominent constitutional law scholars from across the political spectrum have denounced President Obama’s decision to launch a military campaign against ISIS without congressional authorization. My own critique of the president’s actions is almost an apologia for the White House compared to the commentaries by famous liberal constitutional law scholar Bruce Ackerman , conservative Harvard professor Jack Goldsmith (a leading expert on national security law became famous when he repudiated the “torture memo” while serving in the Bush administration), war powers expert Lou Fisher , and Benjamin Wittes of the center-left Brookings Institution.
Ackerman’s critique is perhaps the toughest of the lot. Although Ackerman was one of my mentors in law school, he and I don’t agree on major constitutional law issues particularly often. This case is an exception:
President Obama’s declaration of war against the terrorist group known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria marks a decisive break in the American constitutional tradition. Nothing attempted by his predecessor, George W. Bush, remotely compares in imperial hubris.
Mr. Bush gained explicit congressional consent for his invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. In contrast, the Obama administration has not even published a legal opinion attempting to justify the president’s assertion of unilateral war-making authority. This is because no serious opinion can be written.
This became clear when White House officials briefed reporters before Mr. Obama’s speech to the nation on Wednesday evening. They said a war against ISIS was justified by Congress’s authorization of force against Al Qaeda after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and that no new approval was needed.
But the 2001 authorization for the use of military force does not apply here. That resolution — scaled back from what Mr. Bush initially wanted — extended only to nations and organizations that “planned, authorized, committed or aided” the 9/11 attacks….
Not only was ISIS created long after 2001, but Al Qaeda publicly disavowed it earlier this year. It is Al Qaeda’s competitor, not its affiliate.
When one of the nation’s most famous liberal constitutional law professors not only compares Obama to Bush, but actually concludes that Obama is much worse, them’s fightin’ words!
At some points, I think Ackerman goes farther than is justified in claiming that the ISIS campaign is unprecedented. For example, he argues that it is more clearly illegal than the 2011 war against Libya (which Ackerman also criticized ), because the former cannot be defended on the basis that the United States is “leading from behind.” But while it is true that Britain and France took the lead in the Libya air campaign, non-American forces such as the Kurds, Iraqi government forces, and others are doing the lion’s share of the fighting against ISIS too. In any event (as Ackerman would agree), “leading from behind” cannot justify an otherwise illegal military intervention. Whether the US is in a conflict that qualifies as a war requiring congressional authorization depends on what the president orders American forces to do, not on the number of allied forces that might also be involved in the fighting. Otherwise, Woodrow Wilson could have argued that US entry into World War I did not require congressional authorization. After all, the British and French contributed more troops and suffered far greater losses than the US military did in that conflict.
Secretary of State John Kerry has attempted to defend the administration’s actions by claiming that the campaign is not a war:
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Thursday would not say the United States is at war with ISIS, telling CNN in an interview that the administration’s strategy includes “many different things that one doesn’t think of normally in context of war.”
“What we are doing is engaging in a very significant counterterrorism operation,” Kerry told CNN’s Elise Labott in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. “It’s going to go on for some period of time. If somebody wants to think about it as being a war with ISIL, they can do so, but the fact is it’s a major counterterrorism operation that will have many different moving parts.”
This argument is no more persuasive than Kerry’s attempt, last year, to explain why Obama’s 2011 bombing of Libya had a better legal justification than Richard Nixon’s bombing of Cambodia . Among other things, “war” and “counterterrorism” are not mutually exclusive categories. Counterterrorism campaigns can and do involve enough large-scale fighting to qualify as a war. The campaign against al Qaeda (which the president himself has described as a war) is a good example. And it’s pretty obvious that many wars have “many different moving parts.”
However, hope is not yet lost for the administration. At least one famous legal academic has offered a stronger defense for its actions than that provided by the Secretary of State. Given Obama’s earlier record as a staunch critic of abuses of executive power in the Bush administration, I am not sure that he is especially happy to have John Yoo as one of his most articulate defenders. Still, Yoo’s arguments are worth serious consideration, and I will try to address them in my next post.
UPDATE: Since I originally wrote this post, other administration officials have contradicted Secretary of State John Kerry’s statement that the conflict with ISIS is not a war . It is possible that Kerry’s claim does not represent the administration’s official position. But if the administration really does consider the conflict to be a war, that strengthens the case for adhering to the requirement of congressional authorization.

Bear cub visits golf course  steals ball and our heartsBy Mark Berman September 12 Follow @markberman
Look, I’m going to level with you here: This post contains a video of a bear cub frolicking on a golf course. You can keep reading the introductory patter if you want, or you can just go on ahead and watch the video, and we won’t blame you in the slightest.
The bear plays with the flag stuck into one of the holes on the course, because this bear knows how to make golf a more fun and interesting sport, and then the bear decides to up the ante by stealing the ball, because this bear — a black bear , according to Fairmont Hot Springs Resort, where this took place — does not see any reason why it cannot participate in the game. (Maybe it took a one-stroke penalty for ADORABLENESS, I don’t know, I don’t really get golf.)
Okay, that’s enough patter, here’s the video (via SB Nation ):
Also, yes: Technically (“technically”), this occurred in Canada, somewhat outside the purview of this blog, though such rules only exist to be broken, we always say (we always say this, you just haven’t heard us say this before, trust us, we’ve just said it after you have left the room or something). Also, this occurred earlier in the week, so in Internet time it is roughly 5,000 years old, but that doesn’t really matter either, because it is a video of a baby bear on a golf course.

Disabled persons have not got their due: Supreme CourtNew Delhi, September 12, 2014

The Supreme Court on Friday clarified that the three per cent reservation for disabled persons in government jobs covered all classes of employees, including appointments and promotions to the Indian Administrative Services.
Although 19 years had passed since the passage of the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act of 1995, the disabled were struggling for their rights, a Bench headed by Chief Justice R.M. Lodha said.
“For 19 years, it has not been implemented effectively. The disabled have not received the merit they should have got,” the Bench, also comprising Justices Kurian Joseph and Rohinton Nariman, said. The government should not give a narrow interpretation of the term ‘appointment’ in the Act, it pointed out. It said the word described a broader concept, and included promotions too.

US Dollar Headed for Best Run in 17 Years Amid Fed Rate Hike FearsYou are here: Home Market
US Dollar Headed for Best Run in 17 Years Amid Fed Rate Hike Fears
Reuters | Updated On: September 12, 2014 14:25 (IST)
Gold, Silver Rebound on Global Cues
London: The US dollar headed for its ninth straight week of gains on Friday, some measure of how the economic fortunes of the United States and its major economic peers are diverging after six years of financial turmoil.
Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields rose to their highest in over a month, while European stocks shrugged off weakness in Asia to inch higher.
A broad rise for the greenback was the main bet of most major investment houses this year but it has taken a very long run of relatively good US numbers and a surge in concern over European and Japanese growth for the currency to deliver.
Investors are convinced a Federal Reserve meeting next Wednesday will rubberstamp a shift towards higher interest rates next year suggested by a study by researchers from the US central bank this week.
A 2 per cent rise on the week in response took the US currency to a six-year high of 107.39 yen on Friday. Against the euro it gained 0.2 per cent on the week at 1.2921, broadly flat on the day.
"The dollar generally remains firm but the dollar index has started to show some hesitation," Swedish bank SEB said in a note to clients on Friday.
The dollar index, a measure of the greenback's value against a basket of six major currencies, remained on course for its longest streak of weekly gains since the first quarter of 1997.
A range of political shocks to the system, from turmoil in the Middle East to fighting in Ukraine and a referendum on Scottish independence, have added to the backing for the dollar against a range of emerging and developed world currencies.
But the euro, hammered by worsening economic numbers and further easing of monetary policy by the European Central Bank in the past month, has begun to find some support in the last few days.
Sterling was also looking more robust, helped by a poll that showed supporters of preserving Scotland's 300-year old political union with England four points ahead with less than a week to go before the September 18 vote.
CARRIED BACK
The rise in volatility on currency markets - at a four-year high on sterling on Friday - more broadly has prompted some investors to pare back on carry trades, where they borrow at low rates in euros and yen to buy higher-yielding assets such as commodity-linked or emerging market currencies.
Victims included the Canadian dollar, which plumbed a five-month low of C$1.1030, while Australia's dollar hit a six-month low of $0.9053.
The dollar gains have also pushed oil prices to their lowest in two years, while gold sank to an eight-month trough and copper fell to a three-month low.
In contrast, the dollar's gains on the yen were considered positive for Japanese exports, corporate earnings and equities. The broad Topix index added 0.2 per cent and reached its highest level since July 2008.
Stocks elsewhere in Asia fared less well as investors fretted that even the hint of a shift in Fed policy might spark a withdrawal of funds from emerging markets. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.3 percent at one-month lows.
In Europe, Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 were down 0.2 and 0.1 percent respectively. US retail sales numbers later Friday may fuel speculation over interest rates. Economists expect a solid rebound of 0.6 per cent in August, up from a disappointingly flat reading in July and fuelled by a boom in auto sales.
A strong result would only add to speculation the Fed might refine, or even drop, its commitment to keeping rates low for a "considerable time" after its asset purchase programme ends. That has put yields on two-year Treasuries on track for their highest weekly close since April, 2011.
"The market will be on the defensive going into next Wednesday's Fed meeting due to the growing contingent who are convinced a hawkish language change is imminent," said William O'Donnell, head of Treasury strategy at RBS.
"But bearish expectations may surpass what the Fed will deliver," he added. "We think September is a bit premature for a language change and that the Fed is just looking to have the conversation."

Dining and Drinking Restaurants
The Jimmy John's Gourmet Sandwiches chain is considering selling a major stake in the company and has hired boutique investment bank North Point Advisors to advise on a potential deal, according to people familiar with the matter.
Jimmy John's, founded in 1983 by 19-year old Jimmy John Liautaud in a converted garage, is in the early stage of preparing a sale process, the people said. It remains unclear how big a stake the Champaign, Illinois-based company will eventually offer potential investors.
A deal, which could include private equity firm Weston Presidio's minority stake as well as part of Liautaud's position in the company, is expected to value the restaurant chain at a few billion dollars, the people said. They requested anonymity because the matter is not public.
Weston Presidio acquired a 33 percent stake in Jimmy John's in 2007. The company has completed two recapitalizations since the buyout firm's investment.
Representatives of Jimmy John's, North Point Advisors and Weston Presidio did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Numaligarh Refinery Declares 16% Dividend  Profit Increases by 3-FoldAlibaba to Boost IPO Size on 'Overwhelming' Demand: Report
Guwahati:
With its net profit increasing by over three-fold to Rs 371 crore for 2013-14, the Numaligarh Refinery Ltd today declared a dividend of 16 per cent.
The total dividend to be paid by NRL to its shareholders -- Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), Oil India Limited and Assam government--would amount to Rs 117.70 crore, NRL Chairman S Vardarajan said while addressing the refinery's 21st Annual General Meeting here.
Assam government would receive Rs 14.53 crore as dividend for its equity of 12.35 per cent in NRL.
During the year, NRL contributed Rs 890 crore to the Central exchequer and Rs 244 crore to the state exchequer.
NRL achieved a sales turnover of Rs 9,872 crore recording a growth of 13 per cent while the net profit increased by 157 per cent to Rs 371 crore.
The basic earning per share was Rs 5.04 as against Rs 1.96 in the previous year.
Vardarajan said improvement in financial performance could be achieved through higher crude processing, better refining margin and optimisation of process parameters.
"Our excellence in refinery operations has been exemplified through achievement of highest distillate yield among all PSU oil refineries in the country for the third consecutive year," Vardarajan said.
On the physical front, NRL went on to record 92.16 per cent distillate yield during 2013-14, the highest among PSU refineries in the country.
Crude yield during the period was 2613 TMT, higher than the previous year by five per cent and corresponding to 87 per cent capacity utilisation, he added.
Vardarajan said though NRL was faced with the dual challenge of sub-economic refining capacity and declining trend in domestic crude oil supplies from North Eastern oil fields, it was actively pursuing a proposal of refinery expansion from 3.0 to 9.0 MMTPA at an estimated cost of Rs 16,600 crore, sourcing incremental crude through imports.
Specific initiatives to penetrate the markets of neighbouring countries have been taken with an agreement signed with a Nepal based oil company for export of Motor Spirit (MS) and High Speed Diesel (HSD), he said.
The company is also pursuing the project to lay a 135 km product pipeline from its terminal at Siliguri to Parbatipur in Bangladesh to facilitate sustained export of MS and HSD.
On the marketing front, out of 2,550 TMT of petroleum products marketed by the company during 2013-14, 24 per cent were sold within North East the rest outside the region.
In terms of project implementation, the Naphtha Splitter Project was successfully commissioned in November 2013 and the Naphtha produced would cater to the needs of Assam Gas Cracker once the project gets commissioned.
The NRL is also in the process of establishing its marketing network for Wax through appointment of nine distributors across the country.
NRL has been certified under ISO 50001 for Energy Management Systems (EnMS) during the year, thereby increasing the company's portfolio of international certifications.

Falling oil price tilts political, economic balance in US favour
Reuters Sep 13, 2014, 12.07AM IST

Bank of America-Merrill Lynch
(Higher oil production from…)
LONDON/KUWAIT: The drop in oil prices to their lowest in two years has caught many observers off guard, coming against a backdrop of the worst violence in Iraq this decade, heightened tensions between the West and Russia, and sanctions against Iran.
But as rising supplies of North American crude and tepid demand have pushed prices below $100 a barrel, the move underlies how the shale oil revolution is creating a political and economic advantage for Washington and its Western allies.
Russia and Iran are heavily reliant on oil sales and face budget shortages at current price levels, analysts say, weakening their position when negotiating over Ukrainian sovereignty or the Iranian nuclear deal.
And higher oil production from the United States as well as Canada is providing a buffer against the threat of retaliatory supply curbs from Russia or further disruptions to supplies from the Middle East.
"The increase in production is definitely benefiting the United States," said Professor Paul Stevens at the Chatham House think tank in London.
"The Russians are very exposed to lower oil prices. We don't know to what extent it will influence their behaviour in Ukraine, but they're certainly going to feel pressure on their budget."
Russia's rouble currency has already fallen to a historic low against the dollar as its economy is hit by sanctions from the United States and European Union over its involvement in Ukraine. That increases the price Russians must pay for many imports, from vegetables to luxury goods.
Daily oil production in the United States has risen sharply since the financial crisis. In 2010 the country still imported half of the crude it consumed, but the US Energy Information Administration forecasts that will fall to little more than 20 percent next year.
Even as the United States has largely maintained its ban on exporting crude, it has left a lot of barrels from West Africa and the Middle East looking for new homes. While US energy company profits might take a hit from lower prices, consumers will benefit more from spending less at the pump.
For Iran, a lower oil price not only harms its economy, already hit by sanctions that specifically try to cut its oil sales. It also means there is less pressure on the West to reach a deal quickly over Tehran's nuclear programme.
With oil prices falling, the immediate economic incentive of getting Iranian barrels smoothly back to the world market is diminished, analysts say, allowing Western powers more leeway to drive a harder deal.
Some energy analysts even say Islamic State, which has captured a number of oilfields in Syria and Iraq, will be hurt by lower oil prices as it is forced to discount further the black market sales that help fund the militant group.
"Recent advances by the Islamic State (IS) have disrupted Middle East politics and shifted incentives for key regional and global players," Bank of America-Merrill Lynch analyst Francisco Blanch said this week, arguing that US ally Saudi Arabia may be comfortable with lower prices.
"Lower oil would hurt IS, Iran and Russia, but help the West," Blanch said, adding that he saw the breakeven price for Russia's budget at around $105 a barrel.
 
OPEC REACTION
For Saudi Arabia, the world's largest crude exporter, lower prices may create some short-term budgetary pain, but observers believe the kingdom is willing to absorb the impact as it does greater damage to regional rivals such as Iran.
Saudi Arabia has said for years that it will supply the world with the oil it needs.
"Have you ever seen me concerned?" Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said on Thursday in Kuwait when asked whether the price fall was worrying the kingdom.
"This is not the first time prices change, they always change. It's a dynamic process," he told Reuters.
Other Gulf delegates attending a meeting of oil ministers from the region said the price drop was unlikely to spur action from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) unless crude fell below $85 a barrel.
"It is a fact which is bound to focus minds in the Gulf and in wider OPEC but we also need to remember that this follows many months with good prices from their point of view," Samuel Ciszuk, senior adviser on energy security to the Swedish Energy Agency, told the Reuters Global Oil Forum.
Saudi Arabia is likely to "micromanage" supplies at it has for a number of years, Ciszuk said, but it was unlikely to push for an official OPEC supply cut.
While US oil output has been rising fast, part of the big jump in supplies has come from countries that remain at risk of supply disruptions, including Libya and Nigeria.
"No fundamental improvement in the stability of those countries has actually taken place, which means that the added supply is extremely vulnerable," Ciszuk said.
Libya's oil production has rebounded to more than 800,000 barrels per day, the National Oil Corp said this week, eight times the amount of just a few months ago.
But the increase, which followed a deal to end a near year-long rebel port blockade, has come at a time when the government is losing control of the country, with an armed group taking over the capital Tripoli last week.
For now, however, the US-led surge in supply and weak demand have seen traders start to store additional barrels as they wait for prices to recover.
"Given the volatile situation in the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region," the International Energy Agency said, "this is a benefit to global energy security."

Desecration ... of venerated objectsThe Smoking Gun has the story, and a photograph:
A Pennsylvania teenager has been charged with desecrating a statue of Jesus after he posted Facebook photos that showed him simulating a sex act with the statue….
As seen at right, one of the photos posted to the teenager’s Facebook page shows him with his crotch in the face of the kneeling statue.
The law provides,
A person commits a misdemeanor of the second degree if he:
(1) intentionally desecrates any public monument or structure, or place of worship or burial;
(2) intentionally desecrates any other object of veneration by the public or a substantial segment thereof in any public place; …
Definitions. — “Desecrate.” Defacing, damaging, polluting or otherwise physically mistreating in a way that the actor knows will outrage the sensibilities of persons likely to observe or discover the action.
The maximum punishment for second-degree misdemeanors is two years in jail, but I suspect that the actual punishment, assuming the defendant doesn’t have a substantial criminal history, will be something like probation, community service, and a fine — that’s common for first-offense misdemeanors, as I understand it.
So is this prosecution legally permissible? To begin with, note that posting the pictures, or even taking the pictures, can’t itself be a crime; even setting aside the First Amendment, that wouldn’t constitute “[d]efacing, damaging, polluting or otherwise physically mistreating the statue.” But posting the pictures is indeed evidence of a physical act connected with the statue — climbing on it and posing oneself in a particular way on it.
Note also that the law isn’t limited to religious objects — besides the specifically enumerated public monuments or structures and places of burial, the “object of veneration” language likely includes flags and other respected political symbols. Indeed, Texas v. Johnson , the Court’s flagburning case, involved a “desecration of venerated object” statute.
The legal questions, it seems to me, are these:
1. Is posing with a statue in a vulgar way — a way likely to “outrage the sensibilities of persons likely to observe or discover the action” — while physically contacting the statue “physical[] mistreat[ment]“? I’ve looked, and I could find no caselaw on the subject.
2. If the answer is, “it’s hard to tell,” is the law unconstitutionally vague as applied in this case? Also hard to tell, given that vagueness doctrine is itself vague.
3. Does the law, either on its face or as applied here, violate the Free Speech Clause? To answer that, we’d need to know what the law means.
a. On its face, the law seems to cover a person’s desecrating objects that he owns — for instance, defacing, damaging, or for that matter simulating a sex act with a flag, a Bible, a Koran, or whatever else. (One might argue that a flag that has never been publicly seen before isn’t itself an “object of veneration by the public,” even though it belongs to a class of identical-looking objects that are objects of veneration; but even so, the law would apply to a person flying the flag for a while on his property, and then burning it.) If the law is so read, then it is unconstitutionally overbroad under Texas v. Johnson, since it punishes symbolic expression because of the offensive message the expression sends. And if the law is unconstitutionally overbroad, then it can’t be applied even to conduct that could be punished under a narrower law.
b. What if the law is interpreted as being limited to others’ property, something that the text doesn’t suggest but that might be read into the law on the general background legal principle that people are usually presumed to have the right to do what they please with their own property, coupled with the principle that laws should be read to avoid constitutional problems? There, the issue is different.
There definitely is no First Amendment right to trespass on others’ property for expressive purposes (with a narrow “company town” exception that is not relevant here). But this law doesn’t generally ban all trespasses (even if one were to treat touching a statue that seems to be on an unfenced lawn of an institution as a trespass, which it might be on the theory that it exceeds any permission that the property owner is giving for public access). Rather, if the “physically mistreating” clause is read to mean “engaging in symbolic expression with an object in a way that the actor knows will outrage the sensibilities of persons likely to observe or discover the action” — including when the outrage stems precisely from the behavior being pantomimed — the law is punishing only trespasses that are engaged in for expressive purposes, and that convey a contemptuous or insulting message.
The government interest here appears to be preserving from “outrage” “the sensibilities” of potential observers or discoverers, and (in the words of Texas v. Johnson) this “concern blossoms only when a person’s treatment of the [object] communicates some message” — and “thus [is] related ‘to the suppression of free expression’ within the meaning of [United States v. O'Brien].” After all, if the defendant was posing with the statue respectfully, such as kneeling in front of it and kissing its hand, the law wouldn’t be triggered. If this analysis is right, then the law isn’t just a prohibition on a certain form of trespass, but is a content-based prohibition on trespass.
The question then would be whether this sort of content-based prohibition on a subset of constitutionally unprotected conduct (trespass) is permissible under R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul (1992) . Unfortunately, that, too, is a pretty vague legal rule, sorry to say.
c. Note that the law also covers government-owned monuments standing in traditional public fora (such as parks and sidewalks). I think that the government can prohibit climbing on such a monument, or even touching the monument, even when the monument is in a traditional public forum. But may the government prohibit only that touching of a government-owned monument that outrages public sensibilities, including outraging such sensibilities by the conduct being pantomimed?
4. Finally, does the law violate the Establishment Clause, by specially protecting religious symbols from contemptuous treatment? I doubt it, given that it applies to such symbols as just a subset of symbols that are venerated, whether for religious reasons, political reasons (flags), personal reasons (places of burial), or cultural reasons (monuments to various worthies, political or otherwise).

Ray Rice and how to really protect the NFLBy Alyssa Rosenberg September 12 Follow @AlyssaRosenberg
NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell walks the sidelines before the game between the Seattle Seahawks and the Green Bay Packers at CenturyLink Field. (Kyle Terada/USA TODAY Sports)
Earlier this week, New York Times columnist William C. Rhoden looked back at how National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell said he described his job to the rookies who were joining the NFL in 2010. “I did talk about what I call protecting the shield,” Goodell told journalists of his speech. “My job is to protect the integrity of the NFL.”
Rhoden was looking at the NFL’s handling of former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice’s attack on his then-fianceé and the worship of Joe Paterno at Penn State to make a point that I think is obviously correct. When people commit to protecting an institution and prioritize its reputation above anything and anyone else, they risk setting themselves up to do terrible things. But in our discussions of the culture of the NFL, I think it is important to remember something else as well.
There are two ways to protect the integrity of an organization. One is to deny that the institution could possibly falter in any way and to hang onto that insistence to the point of absurdity. The other is to acknowledge that institutions and the humans who run them are fallible and to commit to vigorous standards of accountability to rectify lapses, punish transgressions and make restitution for the harms committed by the organization and in its name. The former approach separates the interests of the organization from the communities that surround it. The latter suggests that the two are inseparable.
The NFL’s handling of the Ray Rice incident is a perfect example of the former approach.
In February, Rice was captured on a casino security camera dragging Janay Palmer (now Janay Rice) out of an elevator: She was unconscious. The league and Rice’s then-team, the Ravens, attempted to portray the altercation as self-defense on Rice’s part, even though Palmer ended up completely incapacitated. “Janay Rice says she deeply regrets the role that she played the night of the incident,” the Ravens’ official Twitter account wrote in a since-deleted missive back in May . Goodell suspended Rice for a mere two games .
As the scandal has continued to unfold, the NFL’s and the team’s steps forward to accept responsibility have generally been accompanied by steps backward. When Rice was released by the Ravens, owner Steve Bisciotti wrote a letter to financial stakeholders in the team . He suggested simultaneously that “Ray had earned every benefit of the doubt from our organization,” before the release of the full video of his attack on Palmer, and acknowledged that one way the Ravens had extended “every benefit of the doubt” to their running back was to stop seeking the video.
Goodell has admitted that the two-game suspension was a poor choice that minimized the import of Rice’s actions. He has also denied that the NFL saw the full video of Rice’s assault on Palmer until this month, even though an NFL employee appears to have acknowledged receiving a copy of it from a law enforcement official in April.
This week,  an NFL owner told the Wall Street Journal that Goodell portrayed his handling of Rice as a gesture of respect for Janay Rice. If Goodell truly believes this, rather than simply using the rationale as self-justification, he is showing a rather impressive disregard for any message he might be broadcasting on a large scale.
And ESPN’s Don Van Natta Jr. reported today that Goodell characterized Rice’s account of the attack as “ambiguous,” even though four sources told ESPN that Rice acknowledged punching his future wife.
This is hardly the first issue in Goodell’s tenure as commissioner in which he has stuck to denials as long as possible, then attempted to shift responsibility when denials are no longer a possibility.
The league has attacked the research of one of the doctors  who established the link between football and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. When the NFL finally offered a settlement to players who suffered brain injuries, a judge rejected it as financially insufficient . Writing in the Atlantic earlier this month , Patrick Hruby suggested that even if approved at a higher level, the settlement is structured to make it difficult for players to claim compensation, leaving “Medicare, higher private insurance premiums, and charitable contributions” to cover the gap in costs for their health care.
To a certain extent, I understand this strategy. Goodell’s approach to his job has to been deny bad news as vigorously as possible. When it becomes impossible to deny that bad news utterly, his task then becomes to respond in a way that has minimal impact on the NFL’s finances and on the week-by-week play on the field.
As long as Goodell is willing to accept the public perception that he is dishonest or in denial, absorbing the damage on behalf of the league, I suppose it is a viable approach to protecting “the integrity of the NFL.” But no matter how much pain Goodell is willing to accept, this is a way of operating that leaves his league a little more battered with every incident. In life, unlike on the gridiron, sometimes it is better to take the hit and move expeditiously to heal from the damage.

DUSU polls: Sunny day but similar manifestos keep voters away#dusu #aisa #abvp #nsui #narendra modi #delhi university #bjp #congress #srcc #hansraj college #ramjas college #students
New Delhi: Even as the four student bodies campaigned intensively ahead of the Delhi University Students Union (DUSU) polls on Friday, it wasn't enough to attract a vast majority of the almost 1 lakh eligible voters of the university to the ballot boxes.
The voting to elect the representatives of Delhi University Students Union (DUSU) included several new parties like All India Students' Association (AISA), Students' Federation of India (SFI) along with BJP-affiliated Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), and the Congress backed National Students' Union of India (NSUI).
Also, a few Northeast students' parties fielded their candidates.
Pamphlets could be seen scattered everywhere along the roads of Delhi University's North Campus as the polling kick-started at 8:30 in the morning.
Pamphlets could be seen scattered everywhere along the roads of Delhi University's North Campus as the polling kick-started at 8:30 in the morning.
As the candidates waited in anticipation expecting huge turnout, the small queues reflected their campaign had lacked a mass appeal and failed to pull crowds to the polling centres.
"The manifestos are all similar and these elections don't fetch us any good," said Akshay (name changed), a SRCC student who opted for NOTA, an option the election authorities introduced in the DUSU polls for the first time this year.
Among those who voted, many were not even aware of the parties' manifestos.
"We are freshers and we don't know the candidates and their work. We voted as we were advised by our seniors," said a group of first year students from Ramjas College.
Meanwhile, Mithla, who is an Asmeese student from SRCC, said that the student union can be important to showcase the democratic values of University but to normal students who have migrated to Delhi for studies, these polls hardly make a difference.
While all the parties tried to take credit for the success of the controversial four year undergraduate programme (FYUP) being scrapped, AISA expected to gain the most from the influence they thought they have made with their protest against FYUP in the past one year.
In any case, both ABVP and NSUI, the two student parties which have been in this poll game ever since the DUSU elections started in 1954, stole the show yet again as maximum number of voters said they voted for one of these two parties.
Among the two, ABVP seems to have an upper hand for two reasons: They already bagged three out of four seats in 2013 qand already have a winners' track record and secondly, it expects to clean sweep DUSU polls riding on the Modi-wave that led their national party BJP to victory in the recently held Lok Sabha polls.
Meanwhile, AISA and other new entrants failed to make any presence felt as voters were not even aware of their names or the name of their candidates.
In total, there were seven candidates in the fray for the post of president, 32 for the post of vice president, 41 for secretary and 34 for the post of joint secretary of the students' union.
The main agenda during the DUSU elections this year were hostel accommodation, discrimination of the Northeast students studying in Delhi University among others.

Manufacturing may not be out of woods: India Inc | July IIP at 0.5%Manufacturing may not out be out of the woods, says India Inc
PTI Sep 12, 2014, 08.11PM IST
(It is worrying that deceleration…)
NEW DELHI: With IIP growth easing to a four-month low, India Inc today said manufacturing may not out be out of the woods even as it hoped for positive investment and infrastructure driven environment to boost growth.
"The muted performance of the industrial sector...on the back of the negative growth of the manufacturing sector indicates that a full fledged industrial recovery could still be some distance away," CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee said.
Decline in manufacturing output and lower offtake of consumer durables pulled down industrial production growth to 4-month low of 0.5 per cent in July.
"While we were hoping that slowdown in manufacturing had bottomed out, it appears from July numbers that manufacturing may not out be out of the woods. It is worrying that deceleration in July is somewhat broad based extending to consumer durables and capital goods," Ficci President Sidharth Birla said.
"We look forward to the positive investment and infrastructure driven environment, and a robust decision making mechanism to improve ease of doing business, as also indicated by Prime Minister, to fully carry forward the policy of Make in India and boost manufacturing," he added.
The factory output, as measured by the Index of Industrial Production (IIP), had grown by 2.6 per cent in July, 2013.
"It all indicates that the new-found euphoria needs to be backed by concrete policy action in order to see sustainable growth," said Assocham Secretary General D S Rawat.
The industry chamber said it would like policymakers to consider making interest rates charged from the investors and consumers competitive, terming the step as "necessary" especially for reviving consumer durables demand in the festive season.
"Focus on structural reforms in terms of ease of doing businesses, simplification of tax structure and focus on industrial infrastructure would be critical to revive and sustain manufacturing growth trajectory in the coming times," PHD Chamber President Sharad Jaipuria said.

Email services like Gmail and Yahoo! may be banned for govt s official useEmail services like Gmail and Yahoo! may be banned for government's official use
PTI Sep 12, 2014, 08.33PM IST
(A proposal to this effect…)
NEW DELHI: Popular email services like Gmail and Yahoo! are likely to be banned for official use to safeguard critical and sensitive government data.
A proposal to this effect is being moved by Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DeitY) for Cabinet approval by month-end, sources said.
Government communication, barring those of Ministry of Defence and External Affairs, will be done using the platform of the National Informatics Centre (NIC), they added.
While Defence Ministry has its own separate secure email server, the External Affairs too may follow suit.
The move comes amid concerns about rising cybercrime and hacking incidents. Earlier this week, five million usernames and passwords of Google were reported to have been leaked online by Russian hackers.
Government is expected to route official communication through the National Informatics Centre's (NIC) email service.
DeitY has drafted the policy on use of email for government offices and departments and views and comments of ministries concerned are being taken on this, sources said.
Sources said the policy seeks to protect large amount of critical government data and aims to make it mandatory for government offices to communicate only on nic.in platform, not on commercial email services Gmail, Yahoo!, Hotmail, etc.
The policy is expected to cover about 5-6 lakh Central and state government employees for using the email service provided by NIC, they added.
To ensure smooth working of the NIC platform, DeitY will soon require about Rs 4-5 crore to ramp up NIC infrastructure.
Besides, a total investment of around Rs 50-100 crore would be required for full operationability of the policy, including integrating emails with cloud so that official data can be saved on a cloud platform and can then be easily shared with the concerned government ministries and departments.
Governments globally have also been trying to secure their official communication post fallout of the Snowden saga, which contended the US intelligence agencies used a secret data- mining programme to monitor worldwide Internet data to spy on various countries, including India.

Coming soon: New Yorks landmark Times Square in MumbaiMumbai’s cultural centrepiece Kala Ghoda will soon mirror the magic of New York’s landmark Times Square with street acts, vibrant lights, film and cartoon characters and giant electronic billboards, the government said on Friday.
 
The tourism ministry is likely to kick off the project with an initial investment of Rs. 5 crore while the Maharashtra government will also pitch in to create the essential infrastructure and draw private funds.
 
South Mumbai’s Kala Ghoda is the financial capital’s arts district, ringed by museums, galleries, Gothic buildings and some of the city’s oldest cafes. It is named after a black stone statue of King Edward VII on horseback that was removed in 1965 and subsequently placed inside the Byculla zoo a few kilometres away. An arts festival held there every February is a smorgasbord of events.
 
“Kala Ghoda in Mumbai is best suited for the purpose of creating a hub of heritage and culture, mostly open air, as the equivalent of Times Square. The fundamental framework should be ready in a year,” said Shripad Naik, Union minister of state (independent charge) for tourism and culture.
 
Naik said the government is planning similar ventures in other cities, aimed at boosting tourism, with Varanasi likely to be next in line.
 
A 15-foot transparent flagpole – on which the Tricolour will be hoisted –lit from within, drinking water fountains, wide steps for people to sit on and high-resolution web or CCTV cameras to project tourists on giant screens and internet sites are some of the proposed features.
 
“For a city like Mumbai, umpteen ventures like this need to be developed. Once the hub is built, some calendar events should be created,” said Abhijeet Patil, president of the Association of Domestic Tour Operators of India (Maharashtra chapter).
 
Nicknamed Crossroads of the World, Times Square is a focal point of the global entertainment industry and hosts over 39 million visitors annually.

In J-K  after floods come diseasesComments
Hundreds of people have been thronging medical relief camps in Jammu and Kashmir with complaints of nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, acute diarrhoea, severe skin allergies and infected wounds following the state’s devastating floods that have killed more than 200 people.
 
Hours after the army set up a medical relief camp in Srinagar’s Tengpura on Wednesday, it was inundated with people demanding medicines.
 
“Initially, a doctor was assigned for three hours in each camp, but the sheer number of people needing treatment made us run the clinic for the whole day from Thursday,” said Colonel Dinesh Singh, who is in-charge of the unit at Tengpura.

Thousands of people have packed into relief camps in Kashmir following the worst floods in 60 years that have submerged vast swathes of land across the state.
 
“This is just the beginning, it will get worse when the water recedes and leaves behind contaminated food and water, causing diarrhoea, jaundice, cholera and typhoid,” said Dr Mohammad Yahiya Khan, a senior doctor with the government-run Bone & Joint Hospital in Barzullah.
 
Tempers have flared over what many people perceive as the slow response to the floods which seem to have taken the administration b surprise.
 
Authorities have more than 100,000 people across the state and distributed relief materials to people huddled in camps. Flood waters have been receding, but thousands are still stranded across the state.
 
“Clean drinking water is a problem. I have asked authorities to use the medicine liberally to reduce chances of disease," said chief minister Omar Abdullah. “Eight water filtration plants have been set up to distribute safe drinking water … Medicines and disinfectants such as chlorine, phenyl and DDT have been airlifted for supply in affected areas to prevent waterborne diseases.
 
The Union health ministry has dispatched 100 tonnes of 18 of 23 essential medicines and other supplies requested by the state government to replenish the depleting stock of basic medicines for fever, diarrhoea, headache and antiseptics.
 
"These are not enough. We need tetanus injections, antibiotics, oxygen, IV saline and glucose drips, and also medicines in paediatric doses for the thousands of children affected,” said a doctor in one of the army relief camps, who did not wish to be named.

Information and Broadcast Ministry clears 26 new channels#information and broadcast ministry #prakash javadekar #new channels
New Delhi: Pending proposals of 26 new television channels have been cleared by the Information and Broadcast Ministry, taking the total number of channels in the country to above 800.
I&B Minister Prakash Javadekar said he has cleared 26 pending proposals of new channels in news, current affairs and entertainment and some more clearances are in the offing.
Ministry officials said at present there are 798 television channels in the country and with 26 new channels cleared the total number has gone up to 824.
I&B Minister Prakash Javadekar said he has cleared 26 pending proposals of new channels in news, current affairs and entertainment and some more clearances are in the offing.
They also said 4-5 more proposals are being cleared and a final nod will be given to them soon.
Besides these, sources said pending proposals of some more new channels might get cleared in the next few days.
Javadekar said he was clearing all the files that had been "deliberately" kept pending for long by the UPA regime.
On television companies seeking to establish additional channels, the Minister said his ministry was working with the Union Home Ministry to see if there was a possibility that these companies would not require security clearance for their new channel as they already have it for their existing ones.

She didn't even go to college, let alone get an MBA. And you know why? She was too busy working on Nasty Gal.”
Jay Hoffmann, co-founder and CEO, RocketMiles.com:
“An MBA is often part of the recipe but doesn't have to be. More important is having a team of folks aligned against a simple mission, but with different skill sets that complement one another. An MBA can provide the "long view" and reference points for many of the challenges that arise, but capabilities can similarly be attained through a good old-fashioned array of mentors that set high expectations early in peoples' career.”
Howard Tullman, CEO, 1871:
“By and large, having professors in MBA programs ‘teach’ entrepreneurship is like having a priest teach sex education. You need people who have done it, not watched it. The ‘analysis paralysis’ that is part and parcel of the MBA education process is an absolute detriment to successfully building a new business.”

General Motors Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Mary Barra is on a three-day visit to India, meeting dealers, suppliers and other stakeholders throughout the country, to study the market here.
The development assumes significance given the fact that the American auto major has been present in the domestic market for about two decades, but has not been successful at making a significant impact in the automobile sector here.
“We are working to better understand the Indian market so we can give Indian customers what they deserve,” Ms. Barra said.
The company plans to launch 40 new products globally, including India.

Making way for giants
wildlife
India has a significant number of elephants in the wild, and their persistence into the 21st century represents a conservation feat for a country with a massive human population and rising demand for natural resources. Yet, room for the much-loved animal is shrinking as pressures on its habitat and movement corridors mount, and governments pay mere lip service to nature protection. Expansion of rail and road links through elephant territory, often ignoring scientific concerns for the needs of the species, has emerged as a major source of conflict. The Elephant Task Force constituted by the Ministry of Environment and Forests reported in 2010 that not less than 150 elephants had been killed in train hits since 1987, a distressingly high toll for a long-lived species. It is welcome, therefore, that the Supreme Court has delivered a rebuke to the Centre and stepped in to demand answers. The Environment Ministry, and elephant-range States such as Odisha, Assam, Uttarakhand, Jharkhand, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, must tell the country what they have done to prevent the death of elephants in train accidents. A protocol for safety has already been demonstrated in the Rajaji National Park in Uttarakhand, involving remedial measures such as educating train drivers, putting up caution signs along railway tracks, night patrolling to alert drivers and persuading the public not to dispose of garbage in forest areas.
Research data show that steep embankments act as a barrier, while vegetation along sharp turnings of railway lines and hazardously located water bodies attract elephants, contributing to accidents. All these factors were successfully addressed in the Rajaji National Park and elephant deaths prevented. Sadly, conservation is not a sufficiently high priority for some States that have neither replicated this model nor attempted to improve on it. On the contrary, protection of natural habitat for elephants and other charismatic species is often posed as antithetical to development. This ill-informed view disregards the fact that a mere 4 per cent of the land is protected by law today, and elephant presence has shrunk to 3.5 per cent of its recorded historical range. Expansion of railways and roads may be inevitable, but it requires to be done carefully, and remedial measures need to be taken based on scientific insights. To make conservation meaningful, the movement corridors for the species should be excluded from any industrial or infrastructural plans, and mistakes already committed reversed without hesitation. The largest wild population of the Asian elephant is found in India — an estimated 28,000 — thanks to far-sighted forest protection laws. That creditable record must continue.

Professional networking can make you feel physically dirtyBy Elahe Izadi September 11 Follow @ElaheIzadi
Interns schmooze at the Front Page in Washington, D.C. Does this make you feel dirty? You're not alone. (Michel duCille/The Washington Post)
Are you one of those people who dreads networking to get ahead? Does it make you feel icky? Well, you're not alone.
Turns out, networking can make people feel so gross that it translates to feelings of physical dirtiness, according to a study in an upcoming issue of Administrative Science Quarterly .
Researchers found that professional, instrumental networking -- the kind of planned, thought-out and calculated networking used to advance your career -- leaves people feeling more physically dirty than social, spontaneous networking.
Researchers at the University of Toronto, Harvard and Northwestern ran experiments in labs and surveyed lawyers at a large U.S. firm. People were asked to either recount past networking experiences or imagine themselves in certain scenarios. They were also given tasks, like word completions, or told to choose adjectives or products from a list to describe their experience.
They found that people associated calculated, professional networking with the need for cleaning supplies, or with adjectives like "dirty." But people didn't feel that way about spontaneous, social networking.
One explanation: professional networking is often perceived being inherently selfish, rather than something that benefits others, said study author Tiziana Casciaro, an associate professor at University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management.
Think of actively pursuing new friends or spontaneously meeting new people; then think of actively pursuing potential new clients. "That is harder to conceive as altruistically-driven," Casciaro said.
In recent years, there has been "strong evidence" that thoughts of moral impurity actually translate into physical reactions, Casciaro said. For instance, people who commit unethical acts have an urge to cleanse themselves.
The negative attitudes people express toward networking actually prompted researchers to study the psychology behind it.
"When you teach about networks -- what they can help you do -- this stuff comes up. Oh, this nasty business of having to go out there and build relationships and checking people out. It feels awkward and uncomfortable," Casciaro said. "Not everyone feels that way, but obviously many do."
Researchers also found that people with more power -- such as the more senior lawyers they surveyed --  don't tend to feel as dirty about networking. That could be because they either don't care as much about the people on the other end of the exchange, or because they feel like they have something to offer, which makes the interaction seem less selfish, Casciaro said.
Powerful people are more comfortable with networking, which helps bolster their position of power. But people who actually need to network to climb the career ladder are the ones who feel dirty about the process.
Casciaro said that rethinking why you network can alleviate those uncomfortable feelings of dirtiness.
Networking for a new client? Well, it can feel altruistic if you believe in your company's mission, or connect it to how the extra business will help your coworkers. It also helps to look at networking as a learning opportunity and a chance to offer something to the other person, Casciaro added.
"Then this whole moral impurity issue becomes much less important because it's a constructive exercise," she said.
The team is working on another study that delves deeper into how people's attitudes toward networking can influence whether or not they experience that feeling of dirtiness. "The people who do it because they feel like they have to -- they don't like it but do it anyway -- are the ones who feel dirtier," Casciaro said. "The people who do it because of the excitement and possibility -- they do it because there's something potentially positive coming out of it -- they don't feel as dirty."
And that could be good news.
"The attitude you have toward something is much more under your control," she added.

How Chevron s Scientists Misled Courts and Public About Death and Disease in Ecuadorreddit
"Scientists ... involved in developing public health and environmental protections recognize we do not need (and we almost never obtain) proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Waiting for absolute certainty is a recipe for failure: People will die, and the environment will be damaged if we wait for absolute proof ... Out of all scientific uncertainties, few are more complex than understanding the causes of human disease. Scientists cannot feed toxic chemicals to humans to see what dose causes cancer."
Doubt Is Their Product, Dr. David Michaels, 2008
This is how Dr. David Michaels, a leading epidemiologist and former U.S. government scientist, begins a chapter in his seminal and groundbreaking book, Doubt Is Their Product .
The book describes in depressing detail how industries, their scientists, corporate lawyers and large PR firms have "shaped and skewed" science to create doubt about the dangers of chemicals and other toxins industries produce.
The chapter is aptly named: "Tricks of the Trade: How Mercenary Scientists Mislead You."
Michaels published his book in 2008 three years before an Ecuador court awarded a group of Ecuadorian villagers $9.5 billion in damages, resulting from Chevron's intentional contamination of the Amazon rainforest. The oil giant admitted to substandard drilling practices by dumping 16 billion gallons of untreated, toxic "formation water" into waterways relied on by the local population for drinking water as well as building over 900 huge unlined pits to serve as permanent storage for pure crude and water laced with known carcinogens, such as benzene and cadmium .
Comparing the amount of contamination and the amount of time it has remained in the environment with other similar disasters, Ecuador's is one of, if not the, worst environmental disasters in the world.
Since losing the Ecuador trial, Chevron has been trying to discredit the judgment through a series of retaliatory lawsuits in the U.S. Along the way, Chevron has been plying its own special "tricks of the trade" with America's judiciary and the news media -- tricks that noted U.S. experts have called "fundamentally flawed" and "grossly exaggerated."
Chevron's goal has been to create doubt about the contamination's impact, arguing no proof exists that its oil and its operations harmed the environment or an Ecuadorian villager ever, even though Chevron's predecessor Texaco explored for oil exclusively in the concession area and was the only operator of all of the well sites from 1964 to 1990.
Let me repeat. During that 26-year-period -- according to Chevron and its scientists -- the company's admittedly substandard drilling practices did nothing to harm the environment or one single person.
This is part of their "proof": Chevron argued that Mother Nature had "weathered" the oil so much it was harmless and, as a result, no cleanup was needed. Problem is Chevron cheated on its weathering test. The oil giant's scientists found weathering -- or degradation of oil -- even in fresh oil. Chevron's inaccurate use of the test, USEPA Method 8014, "grossly exaggerated the magnitude of weathering." (See more of Chevron's "tricks of the trade" below.)
With its high-priced attorneys, scientists and academics , Chevron has bamboozled one activist U.S. judge and some legal reporters into believing that to prove causation of death and disease the villagers must all but exhume dead bodies and examine them until finding drops of oil inside with the Texaco brand.
Nothing less is good enough, they argue. But such nonsense has never been the standard of proof in a court of law for damages.
American Lawyer's Michael Goldhaber and Businessweek's Paul Barrett have twisted the legal standard of causation in their individual books about the lawsuit, holding the Ecuadorians to a much higher standard than they would face even in U.S. courts, which have a long history of rejecting industry demands of absolute certainty.
As Michaels points out in his book, it is scientifically impossible to prove direct causation of a health problem with absolute certainty. Making that the standard would allow Chevron and indeed the entire oil industry off the hook for every health problem they cause.
Michaels wrote: "Epidemiologists cannot state that a specific chemical exposure has definitely caused the cancer of a specific patient. The lung cancer from asbestos is indistinguishable from the lung cancer from smoking."
But, that hasn't stopped cancer victims and the U.S. government from winning damages for health impacts from tobacco and chemical companies. And, it didn't stop the Ecuadorians in their historic case. Academic studies ( here and here ) have been conducted that show the closer the villagers live to the oil sites, the higher the rates of cancer among them. Uterine cancer victim Rosana Sisalima with her granddaughter are shown here at their San Carlos home in 2004 near Chevron's well sites. Rosana succumbed to cancer in 2006. (Photo by Lou Dematteis/Redux)
Despite Chevron's efforts to discredit the studies, [scientists from across the world criticized those efforts; see here ], the Ecuador courts accepted the evidence and ruled accordingly.  In fact, three layers of courts in Ecuador -- a total of nine judges, including a five-judge panel from the country's highest court - found against Chevron on precisely this legal theory.
Yet Chevron's manipulation of the evidence continues in collateral legal proceedings where Chevron hopes to discredit the Ecuador judgment and evade paying for a clean up.  The oil giant's scientists, led by Dr. Sarah McMillan, are helping the company in this regard. (See here and here .)
But Chevron's antics are being more and more exposed.
Dr. Jeffrey Short, recently retired from a 31-year career as a research chemist at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, reviewed the reports of Chevron's scientists from the Ecuador case and shot holes all through them. So did Dr. Edwin Theriot , the former director of environmental programs for the U.S Corps of Engineers, no bastion of liberal-leaning environmentalism.
Dr. Short, whose report was commissioned by Ecuador's government, concluded that findings by Chevron's scientists -- one of whom I know has been paid millions for his work over the years -- are based on "fundamentally flawed," "grossly exaggerated," and "fundamentally inappropriate" testing methods. ( See page 3 .)
He wrote of Chevron's scientists: "(Their) bias toward underestimating the amount of residual crude oil in a field sample ... is well understood by Chevron's own experts."
In other words, Chevron's experts know their evidence is bullshit.
It's manufactured science -- the kind Michaels warned us about -- designed to produce doubt and create uncertainty, even when it's right before your very eyes.
Chevron's Tricks of the Trade:
For a scientific explanation of these testing methods, see Dr. Jeffrey Short's study .
Chevron used the wrong test to measure toxins in soil -- kind of like putting a stethoscope in someone's mouth to see if they have a fever. Chevron's test, though, sounded so, well, scientific: Toxicity Characteristic Leachate Procedure or TCLP. Only problem is it doesn't measure toxins in soil . (I guess Chevron thought no one would notice.)
Chevron switched toxic dirt samples for clean ones to submit to court -- kind of like convincing someone who doesn't take drugs to pee into a cup for an addict. Chevron paid one of its Ecuadorian consultants to switch out the samples and had no shame touting its "clean" findings. See this photo below of an oil pit where Chevron found no contamination and introduced its "clean" samples as evidence to the Ecuador court.
Chevron undercounted the most hazardous hydrocarbons -- kind of like a kid showing his or her parents only those tests with high scores and shredding the rest. Eventually, though, it catches up with the student and it did with Chevron, too. See here .
Chevron argued that Mother Nature had "weathered" the oil so much it was harmless and, as a result, no cleanup was needed -- kind of like justifying a decision to leave date-expired bottles of poison around for kids to play with. But Chevron cheated on its weathering test. They found weathering -- or degradation of oil -- even in fresh oil. Chevron's inaccurate use of the test, USEPA Method 8014, "grossly exaggerated the magnitude of weathering."

Great Company Requiredreddit
It is evidently a no-brainer, and yet a broadly misunderstood concept: Happy employees make better companies, and better companies (should) make more money. However, translating this easy-to-grasp formula into reality is an entirely different conversation. Not even half of American workers were satisfied with their jobs in 2013, a figure well below the long-term average of over 60 percent (data kept since 1987). Even worse is the global lack of passion at the workplace. Last year, a recognized think tank concluded that only 13 percent of employees in more than 140 countries felt really engaged in their profession. Think of it this way: If you are the constantly busy and overachieving one at your job, nine of your colleagues likely don't "give a hoot."
In the U.S., the low point of workplace dissatisfaction was reached in 2010 (at a ratio of 42.6 percent), shortly after the Financial Crisis had passed and taken a significant toll on employment. A new national study finds that the uneven and protracted economic recovery has led many Americans to believe that the prospects for professional success have changed permanently for the worse, leaving a great majority with a pessimistic outlook about their futures. The reality, quite unfortunately, underlines this belief. Even considering the ever-popular message that the labor market is recovering along with the economy, it is an undisputed fact that America is largely " under-utilized ," with millions of job-seekers working in part-time arrangements, often taking on more than one job to make ends meet.
An unbelievable two-thirds of Americans are stressed and insecure about their jobs and many even fear taking a much-needed and relaxing vacation ; this is a rather sobering fact and, at the same time, indicative that many workers do give a hoot but potentially channel this energy into the wrong aspect of work life: Fear. Of course, there is the other side of the story, particularly America's corporate executive suite. Even though being the boss has become much more lucrative over the years, trying to deal with a declining work ethic across the board poses a significant challenge. Perhaps this is why the business for executive coaching is booming and absorbed more than $1 billion last year . The lasting effects, nevertheless, are questionable, as the workforce wants empathetic and fair leaders, while shareholders want hard facts and ever-expanding corporate profits-often a recipe for total disconnect between the two objectives and groups.
Not all is in vain: For more than 25 years, the Great Place To Work Institute has studied the professional landscape and consulted executives and employees with the objective of turning good companies into great companies. Whereas the process of transitioning from a heavy-headed and frustrated workforce to a productive and collaborative one appears to be nearly impossible, there seems to be a single, differentiating key factor: Trust. Trust that employees and managers feel toward one another serves as the foundation for companies to be highly productive, motivated, and lucrative. Simon Sinek, a recognized coach and author, even brought "chemical proof" to this idea: If employees feel "protected" and can trust their leaders , their entire biochemical outfit aligns with goals and objectives of their professional and private lives.
As I am in the investment business, there is, of course, the pressing question of whether the described "feel-good" factors actually have commercial value, as in our initially stated formula. Apparently, U.S. equity markets are booming on the belief that corporations are at the top of their game, regardless of how motivated employees may be. It is, however, a proven fact that the best companies to work for are creating better returns for their shareholders, irrespective of being privately held or publicly traded. Great Place To Work® companies, between the years 1997 and 2013, have returned 11.80 percent annualized, while the S&P 500, over the same 15-year period, returned a little over 6 percent. Make no mistake, the compounding effects are significant: A dollar invested in the "best companies" would be worth $16.26 today and the "S&P dollar" only $4.33.
A few things to take away: First, even with extensive financial innovation occurring, no one has capitalized on the "best company" concept. To our knowledge, not a single Exchange-Traded/Mutual Fund or Managed Account built exclusively on this premise is available (we will happily stand corrected). Second, all research on the topic is quite simple and focused on obvious concepts, and it is about time, given the devastating numbers for workplace satisfaction, to be reminded of the deep-rooted value systems inherent to every decent human being. Change to foster workplaces that are exciting, creative, collaborative, and (!) profitable is carried in each one of us. Leadership, on the other hand, should not only be considered a concept of hierarchy, but also a higher standard to which we hold ourselves and others accountable.

India Has Potential to Become Knowledge-Based Economy: ADBHSBC Sees Higher India Growth, Lower Inflation in Coming Quarters
New Delhi: India has the potential to become a leading knowledge-based economy with its youth population and growing information technology though it should overcome some barriers in this regard, Manila-based funding agency Asian Development Bank (ADB) said in a report released on Friday.
"India, with its youthful population and thriving information and communication technology (ICT) industry, can become a leading knowledge-driven economy as long as regulatory, education, and infrastructure barriers are overcome," ADB said in its report titled 'Innovative Asia: Advancing the Knowledge-Based Economy'.
The report said pro-poor technologies, growing investment in ICT, advantage in audio-visual services as an outsourcing hub for animation and other skill-intensive industries are few of the promising areas for India.
"By leveraging its strengths in human capital and ICT services, India can become a major global knowledge-based economy," said Bindu N Lohani, ADB vice president for knowledge management and sustainable development.
However, India will need steps such as supportive laws, improved infrastructure, removal of barriers to trade and investment, up-skilling of labour force, higher spending in R&D and innovative financing for small businesses and enterprises, Mr Lohani said.
Knowledge-based economies use ICT, innovation and research, higher education and specialised skills to create, disseminate and apply knowledge for growth.
Currently, the developing Asia ranks well below the OECD average in the World Bank's Knowledge Economy Index. ADB said that advanced Asian economies such as Japan, Korea, Singapore, Taipei and China have successfully shifted from agriculture to manufacturing to knowledge-based industries.
China and India, have built pockets of knowledge-based growth, but have not yet translated this into a broader economic model, the report said.
Countries such as Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Lao have yet to really embark upon knowledge-based growth.
"A shift to innovation-based growth would help countries avoid the middle-income trap and also address rising income inequalities," the report further said.
Established in 1966, ADB has 67 members of which 48 are from the Asian region. It works towards reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth and regional integration.
In 2013, ADB assistance totalled $21 billion, including co-financing of $6.6 billion.

Centre tells Uttarakhand to set up virtual cadre fore-GovernancePrint
Written by Sanjay Singh | Dehradun | Posted: September 12, 2014 9:32 pm
The Centre has suggested the Uttarakhand government to set up a ‘virtual cadre’ for e-Governance taking a cue from Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, which already have taken the first steps towards this direction. The Centre’s letter to the state in this regard appears to be a move towards the implementation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Digital India’ mission.
The Centre has recently written to the Uttarakhand government to consider implementing the proposed scheme which the Expert Committee on HR policy for e-Governance has recommended. The panel was set up in pursuance of the decision of the Prime Minister’s Committee on the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP).
“The scheme is suggestive and it would be for respective state governments to consider adapting the scheme depending on their requirements,” R S Sharma, Secretary in the Union IT Ministry, has communicated to the Uttarakhand’s Chief Secretary Subhash Kumar in his letter.
At a meeting on September 8, Kumar discussed the issues relating to setting up of a virtual IT cadre with the senior officials of the state’s IT department. He has directed the authorities concerned to select at least three resource persons from each government department to ensure maximum use of IT for “good governance”.
As per the suggested scheme for virtual IT e-Governance cadre for states/UTs, the officers for the cadre should be selected from the existing state government employees.
There is also a proposal for the mission mode project (MMP) — a project within the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP) that focuses on one aspect of e-Governance, such as banking, land records or commercial taxes. “Full time mission leaders may be appointed for implementation of IT projects with outlays greater than Rs 50 crore. The mission leaders shall work exclusively for implementation of e-Governance mission mode project. They shall be part of state virtual IT e-Governance cadre,” said the suggested scheme.
About 2-5 per cent of the existing strength of officers and staff at different levels could be selected into virtual cadre. The scheme made it clear that percentages are only indicative and the state governments may decide the category of posts and also decide on the number/percentages.

Alibaba to Boost IPO Size on 'Overwhelming' Demand: Report
Mumbai: Foreign investors will need approval of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to buy equity in private sector lender Yes Bank as it has reached the limit allowed for overseas shareholding.
RBI said foreign shareholding limit in Yes Bank through FIIs/registered foreign portfolios investors (FPIs)/ NRIs/persons of Indian origin/foreign direct investment/American depository receipt/global depository receipts has reached the trigger limit.
"Therefore, further purchases of equity shares of this bank would be allowed only after obtaining prior approval of the Reserve Bank," the RBI said in a release.
The apex bank monitors the ceilings on FII/NRI/PIO investments in Indian companies on a daily basis. To effectively monitor the limit, it has fixed cut-off points two percentage points lower than the actual ceiling.
FIIs held 45.04 per cent shares in Yes Bank as of the quarter ended June 2014, according to data on BSE.

Dow Jones Industrial Average
(US stocks opened slightly…)
NEW YORK: US stocks were lower at midday on Friday, with energy shares extending recent losses after the Treasury department announced new sanctions against Russia.
The market was on track to break a five-week string of gains.
The S&P energy index was down 1.1 percent and among the day's worst-performing sectors. The group has come under pressure this week, during which it has shed 3 percent as crude oil prices fell. Exxon Mobil Corp and ConocoPhillips each lost 1 percent.
The sanctions, designed to punish Russia for its intervention in Ukraine, affect oil and defense industries and further limit major Russian banks' access to U.S. debt and equity markets.
Shares of eBay were up 2.7 percent, the most actively traded issue on Nasdaq, though it pared earlier gains of as much as 4.7 percent after the company dismissed market speculation that Google Inc may be preparing to buy a slice of the company.
"There's been a little bit of a selloff over the last couple of days but nothing big. Maybe we're looking to overseas for some word of what's going on over there," said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.
The S&P 500 was on track for a loss of 0.9 percent for the week so far, which would break a five-week streak of gains.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 52.91 points, or 0.31 percent, to 16,996.09, the S&P 500 lost 8.63 points, or 0.43 percent, to 1,988.82 and the Nasdaq Composite
dropped 16.82 points, or 0.37 percent, to 4,574.99.
The largest percentage gainer on the New York Stock Exchange was Noranda Aluminum, which jumped 31.37 percent, while the biggest decliner was Hyperdynamics, down 12.16 percent.
Among the most active stocks on the NYSE were Sprint, up 5.48 percent to $6.93, and U.S.-listed shares of Petrobras , down 4.20 percent to $16.89.
Nasdaq's most active included Apple, up 0.4 percent to $101.85 and Yahoo, up 2.3 percent to $42.21.
Declining issues were outnumbering advancers on the NYSE by 2,392 to 618, for a 3.87-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,772 issues were falling and 844 advancing for a 2.10-to-1 ratio.
The broad S&P 500 index was posting 16 new 52-week highs and four new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 52 new highs and 26 new lows.

NRI Investments in Realty May Rise 35 Per Cent in 2014: SurveyFree Diesel Prices at the Earliest: RBI Governor
New Delhi: Property developers are expecting a 35 per cent surge in real estate enquiries from NRIs (non-resident Indians) with Bangalore turning out to be a favourite, according to a survey by the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham).
To tap the growing interest, which comes at a time when the global economy is stabilising and India is showing strong signs of revival, real estate companies here are pulling out all the stops by conducting property shows, exhibitions and opening overseas representative offices.
Developers are also expanding their existing distribution chains and entering into strategic partnerships to encourage investors from this cash-rich segment, the industry body said.
The survey was conducted among nearly 850 real estate developers in Delhi-NCR, Chandigarh, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Pune, Dehradun, Chennai etc.
Bangalore was the most favourite property investment destination for NRIs, followed by Ahmedabad, Pune, Chennai, Goa, Delhi and Dehradun, the survey showed.
The enquiries are primarily coming from NRIs residing in the UAE, the US, Singapore, Australia, the UK, Canada and South Africa.
This year, demand is more for the high-end property and commercial buildings, developers say.
"With the revival in global economy, especially in the United States and Europe, people are more optimistic and looking for property to invest in."
"Both small and big developers are focusing on the NRI base in the US, the UK and Asia Pacific region this year," Assocham Secretary General D S Rawat said.
As per the findings of the survey, Ahemdabad (32 per cent) continued to be the most stable market in terms of demand and absorption of both residential and commercial spaces.
NRIs consider Ahmedabad as a safe place to invest in, with lenient government regulations for property investments. Pune was at the third position (30.5 per cent), as per the survey, whereas Chennai (28 per cent) was at the 4th spot and Goa (23 per cent) at the 5th place.
In Delhi, there has been a 21 per cent rise in enquiries this year as opposed to last year  and a majority of them have been for the residential segment.
Catering to the growing demand in the high-end segment, Delhi has also emerged among the promising markets for real estate, the survey showed.

When you can max out student loans  and not have to pay it all backBy Jonnelle Marte September 10 Follow @jonnelle
(Photo from Flickr user Light Brigading under Creative Commons license)
Programs that set student loan payments based on a person’s income and offer loan forgiveness after a certain number of payments are meant to encourage people with college debt to choose jobs based on the merit of the work and not the size of the paycheck.
But they may offer an unintended benefit for people going into public sector or nonprofit jobs — the ability to borrow more heavily than is necessary for a degree without having to pay it all back.
A paper released Wednesday by the New America Foundation  argues that many students planning to take public sector jobs, especially those earning graduate and professional degrees, can see a large chunk of their debt forgiven by the income-based repayment (IBR) program. In some cases, the debt forgiven can amount to most of the cost of a graduate degree, says Jason Delisle, lead author of the report.
“If they think they’re going to end up working at a nonprofit or for the government, then they should borrow as much money as they can get their hands on,” Delisle says, “and go to whatever school they want to go to. ”
People could use student loan money for any number of expenses beyond tuition: to cover rent, books, food, travel or even car payments. So those who borrow more than they need to could milk the benefit, he says.
Here’s how the program works: People who sign up for IBR would make monthly payments based on how much they make, not how much they borrowed. So if they end up in low-paying jobs, and receive loan forgiveness on top of that, they may see much of their total debt load discharged.
Forgiveness can be more generous for borrowers who take qualifying jobs in the public or nonprofit sectors because they would be eligible to have their debt forgiven after 10 years of payments. For instance, a social worker earning in the 75th percentile would be responsible for the first $28,000 in loans, even if they took out the typical debt load of $49,000 – before interest– according to the New America Foundation.
People who make more will pay more. For a lawyer whose earnings are in the 75th percentile, the tab would be larger, adding up to about $117,000, compared to the median debt load of $140,000.
Most people with federal loans will qualify for IBR, which limits payments to roughly 15 percent of their income, after subtracting an exemption that is based on the federal poverty level, and forgives debt after 25 years of payments. People with direct loans taken after October 2007 will qualify for a program that limits payments to about 10 percent of income and offers forgiveness after 20 years of payments. (If the payment required under the standard 10-year repayment plan is smaller than the income-based amount, then borrowers would pay that.)
The programs apply only to federal loans, meaning that people who also have private student loans would only be able to have the public loan portion of their debt forgiven. (Required payments would be 10 or 15 percent of income after the exemption, or the regular payment amount under the standard 10-year repayment term — whichever is smaller.)
People with graduate degrees may get the biggest benefit out of the program, Delisle says, because they can take out more in federal loans. There is a lower cap on how much people can take out in federal loans for an undergraduate degree.
Of course, millennials seem especially averse to piling on more debt . That said, many will probably try to minimize their debt loads on the chance that plans change after graduation. People who later land lucrative jobs or decide against joining the public sector could then be on the hook for most, if not all, of their bill, says Lauren Asher, president of the Institute for College Access & Success, a nonprofit that works to make college more affordable.
People’s plans may change after an illness or a major family event, Asher says. Some people may intend to work in a low-paying field but then see their household income jump if they marry someone who makes much more, she adds.
It’s also worth noting that people with graduate degrees, who tend to have larger debt loads, also make more on average than people with only undergraduate degrees, which could minimize the benefit they get out of the program, Asher says. “No one can know for sure what their job or earnings will be in the future,” she says.

Indian economy poised to grow at 5.6 per cent in 2014: UNCTADNEW DELHI, September 11, 2014

Indian economy poised to grow at 5.6 per cent in 2014: UNCTAD
PTI
Tweet
The Indian economy will grow at a rate of 5.6 per cent in 2014 while developing economies as a whole will see between 4.5 and 5 per cent rise in economic expansion, a report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) said on Wednesday.
The UNCTAD Trade and Development report 2015 forecasts that developing economies as a whole are likely to repeat the performance of previous years, growing at between 4.5 and 5 per cent. It forecasts China’s economy to grow by 7.5 per cent in 2014.
Improved performance of mining, manufacturing and services sector pushed India’s economic growth rate to two-and-a-half- year high of 5.7 per cent in the April-June quarter.
Speaking at the report launch, Jawaharlal Nehru University Professor and economist Jayati Ghosh, however, said expectations might need to be tempered.
“This recent (domestic GDP) growth that everyone is getting excited about it, that there is possibility for 7 or 8 (per cent), yes it is possible but what are we seeing so far, we are seeing another bubble being generated,” Ms. Ghosh said.
“It is not growth based on sustained foundations and the bubble will again be associated with construction, house prices and the like rather than sustained demand of basic needs, basic infrastructure and so on. “So, I am a little wary of this recent recovery.
“ I don’t think that a recovery based on these is a sustainable one and I think it would leave us with bigger problems in future,” she added.
Expressing concern over power sector issues, Ms. Ghosh said, “There are at least 16 and I think possibly 25 major power investments that are half complete, and are possibly never to be completed, all of which have taken public sector loans which are paid for finally by all of our money and which are never going to repay.’’
The UNCTAD report forecasts that growth will exceed 5.5 per cent in Asian and sub-Saharan countries, but will remain subdued at around 2 per cent in North Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean. Meanwhile, transition economies are expected to further dip to around 1 per cent, from an already weak performance in 2013.

Gislen to double head count in India
Special Correspondent
IT Enabled Services
Swedish IT outsourcing firm Gislen Software is planning to double its head count in India to 100 from 50.
Founded in 1994, Gislen Software is focused on exports to Scandinavia. It has competence in areas such as public transportation and embedded systems, among others.
The firm has a facility at Madras Export Processing Zone near here, and has completed 20 years in India.
“We have grown from a 3-people start-up into an agile company focused on niche applications in the past 20 years,” Mikael Gislen, Managing Director and majority stake holder of Gislen Software, said.
The company counts TNS, ABB, SKF, Scandinavian Airlines, Swedish Match and PostNord as its top clients.
Mr. Gislen said the firm’s current facility could house 80 people, and it would be looking at an extra facility within MEPZ or in the neighbourhood.
Mr. Gislen also said that low attrition had also helped the company.  

The CBIs crisis of credibilityUpdated: September 12, 2014 01:12 IST
The CBI’s crisis of credibility
N. K. Singh
PTI DIFFICULT TIMES: For those who have worked in the CBI, the ongoing controversy is a cause of concern. Picture shows CBI Director Ranjit Sinha at a conference in New Delhi.
TOPICS
justice and rights
The line between superintendence and interference in the agency’s investigation work is no doubt thin but by no means is it vague
The Supreme Court is currently seized with allegations against the Director of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) Ranjit Sinha for meeting persons linked with the 2G scam and coal scam at his residence. The court, which is currently monitoring investigation into these corruption cases, has evidence reflected in the entries in the visitors register maintained by his security staff. On Monday, September 8, 2014, the court described the allegations as “serious” and asked the Director to file his version through an affidavit within a week.
For those of us who have worked in the CBI for a long time, it is a matter of grave concern that the agency is facing such a crisis of credibility. However, this development should not be usurped by a section of people keen to continue the stranglehold of political and bureaucratic authority over the professional work of the CBI or any other agency.
About a week earlier, the Supreme Court had called the CBI “a caged parrot” which “speaks in its master’s voice” after the investigating agency admitted in an affidavit that Ashwani Kumar, who quit as the Law Minister earlier, and senior officials of the Prime Minister’s Office and the Coal Ministry had made certain changes in the ‘status report,’ on the allocation of coal blocks.
During the hearing, the Supreme Court had asked the Centre whether it was contemplating a law to make the working of the CBI independent and insulate it from extraneous intrusion and interferences. The Group of Ministers (GoM), set up by the Central government in May 2013, was entrusted with the task to bring a Cabinet proposal on the law to safeguard the CBI’s autonomy. The report of the GoM was duly submitted to the court. Some others including the CBI also submitted their views. The court’s orders in this regard are awaited.
The meaning of autonomy
Some views in this matter have been rather misleading and it needs to be reiterated that autonomy does not mean complete freedom or unbridled independence. Autonomy for the CBI or for that matter any investigating agency means the freedom to investigate crime, while it remains under the administrative control of the government of the day. Much was made of Section 4(2) of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, which vests superintendence of the establishment in the Central government. This Act provides legal power to the CBI and under it, the Special Police Establishment (SPE) division conducts its investigative work. The agency does not function in isolation. It should be part of governance machinery. In its work, it needs the cooperation of other agencies of the government, such as the Income Tax department and the Enforcement Directorate. For investigation abroad, it needs the cooperation of foreign governments, for which it needs support of the Ministry of External Affairs here.
“A new CBI Act must substitute the archaic Delhi Special Police Establishment Act and the role, jurisdiction and legal powers of the agency need to be clearly laid down”
The line between superintendence and interference in its investigation work is no doubt thin but by no means is it vague. Under our legal system, the political executive cannot cross that line. Be it the CBI or the police, they do investigation under the Criminal Procedure Code, and for this work, they are accountable to law and to law alone. The English judge Lord Denning had put it succinctly in the case Regina versus Metropolitan Police Commissioner in 1988, demarcating the duties of the Commissioner of Police and Secretary of the State (Home Minister), thus:
“I have no hesitation, however, in holding that, like every constable in the land, he should be, and is, independent of the executive. He is not subject to the orders of the Secretary of State... I hold it to be the duty of the Commissioner of Police, as it is of every chief constable, to enforce the law of the land. He must take steps so to post his men that crimes may be detected; and that honest citizens may go about their affairs in peace. He must decide whether or not suspected persons are to be prosecuted; and if need be, bring the prosecution or see that it is brought; but in all these things he is not the servant of anyone, save of the law itself. No Minister of the Crown can tell him that he must, or must not, keep observation on this place or that; or that he must, or must not prosecute this man or that one. Nor can any police authority (which in the U.K. means local executive authority overseeing police work) tell him so. The responsibility for law enforcement lies on him.”
The above judgment has been quoted by the Supreme Court with approval in scores of cases, including in the 1997 Vineet Narain case. The Central Vigilance Commission Act of 2003 was a result of this order of the apex court. But it was an apology of an act. For instance, it brought back the ‘Single Directive’ requiring the CBI to obtain prior permission of the government before initiating enquiries into allegations of corruption against government officers in the rank of Joint Secretaries and above, which had been quashed by the Supreme Court earlier.
The Supreme Court on May 6, 2014, again quashed Section 6 (A) of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act (DSPEA) of 1946 in reiteration of its earlier order dated 18.12.97.
Centrality of Lokpal
The Lokpal Act goes further and provides for the appointment of the Director of CBI by a collegium comprising the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition, and Chief Justice of India. This should meet the requirement of proper selection. Now let us come to the main concern of the Supreme Court on how to “liberate the CBI from any extraneous consideration and interference so that the investigation is not maligned.” One ought not to mix up this issue with the conduct of an individual officer, however high. The answer to the court’s concerns perhaps lies in recognising the centrality of the institution of Lokpal. Under this Act, the services of the CBI would be placed at the disposal of the Lokpal for investigation of cases, which the latter decides to take up. The CBI will report not to the government of the day, but to the Lokpal for investigation into such cases, over which the Lokpal will have the power to oversee and supervise, in the manner the Supreme Court has done in some cases of controversial nature.
Finally, a new CBI Act must substitute the archaic DSPE Act. The role, jurisdiction and legal powers of the CBI need to be clearly laid down.

PSA: You Can t Share Or Sell Your Pasta Passreddit
Olive Garden’s sold out, seven-week-long unlimited pasta pass promotion just hit its first big hump -- if eating Olive Garden for nearly two months wasn't already considered an obstacle.
After all 1,000 of the company's limited edition, $100 "Never Ending Pasta Passes" were sold within hours on Monday, dozens of lucky pass-holders decided to capitalize by turning to eBay.
There's just one big problemo: Olive Garden says the passes are “non-transferable and may not be re-sold."
As of Thursday afternoon, 48 passes were up for auction on eBay, many listed at prices between $150-500. Fortunately for those who already purchased a pass on the secondary market, Olive Garden says it’s willing to be flexible to ensure pasta-lovers aren't turned away.
"The cards are personalized and not transferable; however, hospitality is core to who we are, which is why we'll work with anyone who's purchased a card on eBay to ensure they enjoy Never Ending Pasta Bowl,” spokeswoman Tara Gray, of Olive Garden’s parent company Darden Restaurants, told CNBC. “I'd encourage those guests to reach out to us directly via phone or social media."
Not one of the few prized passholders? There's still hope. Olive Garden says it's planning to distribute even more passes through social media in coming weeks.

Change: A CEO s Job In The 21st Centuryreddit
A quick scan of recent top business lingo lists--an attention-grabbing feature frequently posted at sites such as the Harvard Business Review and Forbes--shows that none included some of the most relevant words of the moment: speed, uncertainty and change. Unlike many buzzwords in vogue today (think transparency, actionable, authentic and synergy), these are direct and comprehensible. More significantly, they capture the realities of doing business right now, for the marketplace is changing with breakneck speed and becoming exponentially more complex, diverse and unpredictable than ever before.
This means significant changes are in store--and in many cases already underway--for all businesses.
While this will not always be easy, it is for the good, as change is not only inevitable--it is essential for sustained and healthy business growth. A recent Bain & Company study of more than 2,000 companies indicates that 90 percent fail to achieve and maintain healthy growth objectives. That's why a successful company needs to deploy appropriate strategies for proactively driving change and sustainable growth.
Challenging The Status Quo To Achieve Greater Success
Pioneering companies proactively embrace change--not on a reactionary basis or simply as inevitability, but as an opportunity to challenge the status quo and achieve greater success. I'm not talking about incremental changes, which are minor fixes for mature or potentially troubled products. I mean big, meaningful and sometimes disruptive changes that can only take place when a company is at the top of its game--or at the very bottom.
There's no shortage of poignant examples of what happens when companies fail to proactively embrace such change when it's needed. Consider the examples of Kodak, Rand McNally and Blockbuster.
Kodak suffered one of the most unfortunate corporate implosions in recent memory when it failed to capitalize on the digital technology it invented in 1975 for fear of undercutting its core business in film and processing. Similarly, mapmaker Rand McNally stumbled badly when it failed to make a timely transition from paper to digital content. And think about what has happened to books, newspapers, magazines, encyclopedias, tapes and CDs.
Admired And Innovative Companies
At the other extreme, think of the likes of Apple, Amazon and Google - the top three winners in Fortune magazine's most recent list of most admired and most innovative companies. All are boldly exploring disruptive possibilities and options beyond their core competencies, investing in fresh ventures--including most recently television technology, drone-to-door delivery and driverless cars. Pundits sometimes scoff at these cutting-edge gambles, however I'm certain that all three companies are on the winning side of their bets.
Hollywood also figured this out years ago. Look at the new, rebooted, multi-billion-dollar franchises for Spider-Man, Batman and Star Wars. Producers have been fearless in reinventing these already-popular series by changing actors, directors and storylines to keep the franchises growing. Dangerous? Certainly. But box office receipts on the latest iterations of these familiar movie brands have proven them right.
Understanding And Driving The Right Change Needed
A key responsibility of the company's senior management is to proactively identify and drive the right change needed for current and future success-and in certain cases to lead and drive multiple kinds of change simultaneously.
In fact, there are actually three distinct kinds of change:
• Disruptive Change, which creates entirely new business models , such as Google, Facebook, Netflix, Wikipedia, Amazon's Kindle and Apple's first iPhone.
• Radical Change within existing organizations--as when Unilever doubled-down on its business investments during an economic downturn. Or when Samsung, at the height of its game these days, merged its Engineering division into Samsung Heavy Industries earlier this year to boost its expertise in offshore plant construction and raise operational efficiency.
• Incremental Change, those minor course corrections such as flavor extensions, packaging redesigns and constant upgrades such as moving from the iPhone 4 to the iPhone 5.
Building Support For Change
It's critical for senior management to foster an organization-wide culture of change.  That means building and empowering teams beyond top management who are versatile and nimble, and capable of adapting to, and embracing, an evolving status quo.
Toyota established and embedded a culture of change by flattening its organizational hierarchies and instilling a relentless passion throughout the company for eliminating waste and for constantly seeking out and implementing process improvements. The result was so successful at creating a culture of proactive change that Hyundai has also embraced it, reports Fast Company. Additionally, Jason Seiken, PBS's senior vice president, created a culture of change by accepting failure as an inevitable by-product of risk and good work. "A company that takes three risks, resulting in two successes and one failure, is ... still ahead of competitors who take no risks at all ," notes Fast Company blogger Mark Lukens of global management consulting firm Method3.
Separating Culture And Values
Paul Polman would agree. He leads Unilever, the world's second-largest food producer--and a company that derives 57 percent of its sales from emerging markets. In 2008, when the market crashed, Polman chose a course diametrically opposite most business leaders and stepped up investments.
In a recent interview with KPMG's ConsumerCurrents, Polman notes that Unilever bucked the trend to invest in IT systems, R&D, new launches in new markets and major acquisitions--gambles that worked in its favor.
Polman says employees bought into the strategy once the company emphasized the point of separating culture and values in the midst of disruptive change. "Culture changes," he says, "but values remain the same: If [founder] Lord Lever came to this company today, he'd find the same ideals as when he built it. We spend a lot of time making sure that our pioneering work is carried out globally with integrity and respect."
Putting Your Ideas To Work
Increasingly, we see these ideas at work at the highest levels of business enterprises. When Jeffrey Immelt, chairman and CEO of General Electric Corp., addressed the Detroit Economic Club, he said, "Change can come, but it requires a new way of thinking. It requires a clear and determined plan of action. It requires leaders throughout the economy to take command of events."
And Immelt is a step ahead of the change game. In the same address, he noted that while GE remains productive and competitive and invests massive amounts in technology, products and services, "we know we must change again," he notes.
Applying Change Management
No business is immune to the significantly changing marketplace. And in the food and beverage industry, consumers are changing, as are their consumption habits and expectations of the products they consume and the packaging that protects and dispenses those products. As a result, food and beverage suppliers, producers and retailers are also changing.
Tetra Pak understands this, and evolution and innovation are part of our DNA. We started out by introducing a disruptive innovation, the first paper-based liquid food packaging, and built on it, creating product lines that today support growth in 171 countries. But to make that growth profitable, and our market leadership sustainable, we continually challenge the status quo and invest in innovation and change -- internally within our organization, and externally to provide our customers, and ultimately consumers, with the packaging and processing systems that meet current and future needs and expectations.
This kind of achievement requires agility in anticipating changes to our business environment, ranging from evolving consumer preferences to competitive threats and other as-yet unknown factors. While no one can foretell the future, we can gain astute predictive insights from being extremely close to the wants and needs of our customers--which is precisely what prompted our organization to elevate its geographically dispersed regional vice presidents to our Global Leadership Team. This move brings their unprecedented first-hand knowledge of each region to the highest levels of the organization with speed and accuracy, leading to more agile decision-making.
This calls to mind a strategy Warren Buffett cited when he stated "Should you find yourself in a chronically leaking boat, energy devoted to changing vessels is likely to be more productive than energy devoted to patching leaks."  It's a CEO's job to boldly lead a company at the height of its success, with resources still intact, into changes that will have the most sustainable, positive impact in the long-term.

5 Unexpected Reasons To Buy Americanreddit
There is nothing more unifying in America than our love of storytelling. We sit around dinner tables and campfires, telling tales about our travels and experiences, talking about our pasts and the pasts of those we love the most. These stories unify us in community and country and give us a pride of place.
The stories about the goods still manufactured here are fascinating because the people making these goods are fascinating. We can learn so much about each other, and ourselves, by tuning into and passing on these stories, generation to generation.
We, Max and Joe, are Americana enthusiasts. We love traveling to factories across the country to observe manufacturing techniques and meet the talented people behind the goods made right here in America. In partnership with Maxwell House, a brand built on passionate and dedicated coffee-makers, we'll bring those stories to life for you with our online show, " Made Right Here ."
Here are five reasons for buying American. Some just may surprise you.
1. Americans increasingly want to meet the people behind their goods.
Our country has been revolutionized in recent years by a renewed desire to connect with the people who make the things that they purchase and consume. Now, more people than ever before deeply care about where goods come from and how they are produced. They want to meet the artisans, craftsmen and factory workers who actually built and made those items, and learn exactly how these creations made it into their homes. In particular, they want to hear about the thoughtful, hands-on practices and skills involved in making those goods a reality.
Why is this? It’s because the things that we use, day in and day out, have a tremendous potential to connect us as individuals and as a community. This is what “Made Right Here” is all about. Introducing Americans to the people behind the products in their world.
2. More does not equal better.
In times of economic prosperity, excess comes easy, and America enjoyed many years of plenty in the 20th century. We became accustomed to satisfying our needs immediately instead of thinking deeply about what we buy for ourselves and our families. The stuff quickly piled up, and we became hooked on convenience and a satiation of "want."
But lately times have been tighter, and our wallets aren't quite as heavy as they once were. We're being more thoughtful about our spending.
This presents a great opportunity for us, as a country, to take a closer look at our purchase decisions. Why buy five pairs of shoes that are poorly made when you could invest in one or two pairs made locally and from sturdy materials - and actually have a say in how they were made? They'll last you for years and years, and you could even pass them down to your children.
Having a bunch of things that are not made well, without a personal connection, fuels a disposable society. It's not sustainable.
Our motto is, "Buy once. Buy right."
3. We can wait.
We live in a world where we want everything delivered to us as fast as possible, for free. The idea of "getting it yesterday" is often made possible on the backs of low-income workers in foreign countries, working around the clock.
Rather than championing a service that puts unnatural pressure on people and resources, we choose to celebrate and shine a light on people who make great things and make them better. It may cost a little more, and it may arrive a bit more slowly. But taking the time to learn about the manufacturers of our goods creates a symbiotic economy in which we can meet each other's needs and deepen our connections to one another.
4. Your neighborhood and community are worth the investment.
The two of us take it personally when we talk to people in their 70s and 80s, and they say, "Your generation doesn't have the same set of values as we do." We want to be able to look these individuals in the eye and know that we've done all we can to support the people and places in which our country is rooted.
Through "Made Right Here," we are not pursuing the "days of old" but a greater appreciation for those who have come before us - for those who diligently work hard to make a good life. We want American manufacturers and their employees to be engaged and successful in meaningful jobs.
One of our "Made Right Here" episodes took us to Jacksonville, Fla., to a manufacturing facility for Maxwell House Coffee. The workers there were extremely passionate about keeping jobs in their community and proud of their company's heritage.
We’re committed to investing in these employees’ lives – emotionally and financially – and in American products like Maxwell House coffee, which are made by people who share our pride of country, work, family and friends. They’re worth it.
5. Story matters. A lot.
Bringing back a bottle of wine from a trip to Italy and sharing it with your friends over dinner used to be the quintessential example of sharing a story in relation to hospitality. Today, Americans are proud to serve their friends beer brewed in their father's basement made with hops acquired from local community-supported agriculture. There is nothing more personal, and pride-inducing, than sharing what you've made with the ones you love. That direct relationship between people and their products has never been more relevant. Beyond being a good story, this invokes a sense of pride in ownership.
So we issue this challenge to Americans: When you make a decision about what you're buying, try to tie your dollars to the people you picture making it. Imagine your money going directly into their pockets. Suddenly, keeping those dollars local, or regional, means a lot more. It's a soulful exchange.
It's something you can feel proud about. Patriotic, even.

TVS eyes higher share in scooter segment

The Hindu TVS which launched Scooty Zest 110 in Hyderabad on Thursday and is looking at monthly sale of 75,000 scooters.

automobile
The company sold about 17.5 lakh two-wheelers in the domestic market last year and expects this number to surpass 22 lakh mark.
TVS Motor Company, India’s leading two-wheeler manufacturer, expects to increase its market share in the scooter segment from 15 percent to 18 percent in two months.
The company, which launched TVS Scooty Zest 110 in Hyderabad on Thursday, is looking at monthly sale of 75,000 scooters, up from current level of 60,000. The total volume of the scooter market in the country is 3.5 lakh per month.
TVS vice president, sales, said they expect a growth of over 30 percent in the overall sales volume during the current financial year. This is driven by a robust growth in the country’s two-wheeler market and the new launches by the company.
The firm, which launched several models so far, plans two more later this fiscal. “The scooter range has been positioned to address different segments, such as Jupiter for male, TVS Wego as a sleek two-wheeler for husband/wife and the Scooty for young women,” he said.
TVS also plans to roll out two more motorcycles during the year. These include a commuter segment bike and another in the performance category.
The company sold about 17.5 lakh two-wheelers in the domestic market last year and expects this number to surpass 22 lakh mark.
The scooter segment is growing at a higher rate than the two-wheeler industry. The growth in the segment last year was 24 percent and in the first five months of this fiscal it was 30 percent, double than the growth in the two-wheeler industry.

Achche din   Gujarat model promise missing in BJP s UP bypoll campaign'Achche din' missing in BJP's UP bypoll campaign
Sunita Aron , Hindustan Times  Lucknow, September 12, 2014
First Published: 20:11 IST(12/9/2014) | Last Updated: 00:18 IST(13/9/2014)

The much-talked-about Gujarat model of development has not found many takers among Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP's) star campaigners in Uttar Pradesh ahead of the by-elections to one Lok Sabha and 11 assembly seats slated for Saturday.
The 'achche din' promise has also taken a back seat, while BJP MP Yogi Adityanath has launched a war against 'love jihad'.
High-profile Union ministers were missing in the campaigning phase, even though the by-elections are key to the BJP's fortune in the politically crucial UP where it won 71 of the 80 seats in the April-May Lok Sabha elections under the leadership of Amit Shah, who is now the party chief.
The Lok Sabha election plank of the Guajarat model may be in the back-burner, but Shah's "BJP-yukt UP (read BJP-fied UP)" slogan is the new hit, especially since the party is eyeing to form the next government in the state.  
The BJP holds all 11 assembly seats - one with its ally Apna Dal - which go to polls on Saturday.
After suffering setbacks in the recently held bypolls in Uttarakhand, Bihar and Karnataka, the BJP will want to register some feel-good victories in the Saturday chapter of elections in UP and nine other states.
Read: Crucial bypolls tomorrow; will Modi magic work this time?
Besides, Prime Minister Narendra Modi represents the prestigious Varanasi parliamentary constituency in UP. The results could also be decoded as a reflection on his performance.
Meanwhile, the Bahujan Samaj Party's (BSP's) absence from the electoral fray could give the BJP an edge. This means the BJP can go all out to woo the 'saffronised Dalits'.
For this crucial vote bank, the ruling Samajwadi Party (SP) is not a favoured choice;  neither is the Congress.
But, chief minister Akhilesh Yadav, whose SP government is faced with the anti-incumbency threat, is trying to turn the tables, questioning the central government's performance.
His father, Mulayam, on his part, has raised national issues and challenged Modi at election rallies: "I will garland Modi if he can get our encroached land back from Pakistan and China."
Incidentally, none of the senior BJP national leaders, barring Union minister Kalraj Mishra, have campaigned for the bypolls.
Even Union home minister Rajnath Singh, who is indebted to BJP veteran Lalji Tandon for handing over Atal Bihari Vajpayee's Lucknow seat to him, has not addressed any rally in the state capital.
Some posters of Modi and Shah can be spotted here and there, but few are talking about the Prime Minister's achievements.
A reason cited by some BJP leaders is that the bypolls are for the state assembly and not the Lok Sabha.
However, Mainpuri still remains in the question. SP national president Mulayam has launched a no-holds barred battle to retain this Lok Sabha seat.
For the BJP, a campaign led by state chief Laxmikant Bajpai and firebrand MP Yogi Adityanath has focused primarily on "communal" issues.
While the national leadership of the BJP has been distancing itself from issues like 'love jihad', conversion and cow slaughter, the party's state leaders seem to have nothing else to harp on. After all, statements like 'No Jodhabai will go to Akbar' touch a chord.
Strangely, the Election Commission sought an explanation from Yogi Adityanath, who made the statement and defied a poll meeting ban, two days before the campaigning came to a close.
But, in the opposition's words, the damage had already been done to the state's social fabric by then.
However, Adityanath's brand of politics will face an acid test in Mainpuri, where Mulayam had been campaigning for his grandnephew and taking on Modi directly.

Black money in play as Maharashtra  Haryana polls inch closerBlack money, doles come into play as Maharashtra, Haryana polls inch closer
Chetan Chauhan , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, September 12, 2014
First Published: 20:28 IST(12/9/2014) | Last Updated: 20:37 IST(12/9/2014)
Political parties began supplying black money for vote-buying to their workers in Haryana and Maharashtra before the election commission announced assembly poll dates for the two states on Friday, officials said.
 
The Election Commission (EC) can only direct the state police and other investigating agencies to probe the use of illicit funds in elections after declaring the voting schedule. And political parties are exploiting this escape clause.
 
Many candidates routinely dole out cash, alcohol and other goodies to voters in Indian elections for acquiring their support. The poll panel seized over Rs. 300 crore in cash and more than two crore litres of liquor along with other illegal inducements during the parliamentary and assembly polls this year.
Read:  Maharashtra, Haryana assembly polls on October 15; results on 19th
 
Election officials said the BJP distributed funds for poll management to most district and block-level committees in Haryana, especially in areas where the party is expected to do well based on an internal survey.
 
“A senior party representative declared at a party function recently that money will not be a constraint. Subsequently, huge amounts of cash reached the functionaries in-charge of these assembly constituencies,” a senior poll panel official said, expressing inability to tackle the problem.
 
Haryana’s close proximity to Delhi, Rajasthan and Punjab helps parties push liquor and cash into the state without drawing too much attention. The EC officials said that with the announcement of polls, instructions have been issued to the state administrations to put up check posts at all entry and exit points to prevent the inflow of black money and liquor.
 
In Maharashtra, the officials said, both the NCP and the BJP functionaries have received illicit funds for the elections which have been used to mobilise workers. “Some senior leaders of the two parties themselves distributed cash and we even informed the state government, but by the time a team reached the locations the job was done,” an EC official said.
 
Election commission sources also said that politicians in Maharashtra plan to distribute gifts to voters during the lengthy festival season in October. The total spending by the political parties in the polls is expected to be about Rs. 2,000 crore, according to an unofficial estimate.
 
“It is very difficult to establish which party has distributed these goodies as the gifts don’t bear a party symbol – only the name of a party functionary who may not be contesting. In such a situation, electoral laws prohibit us from taking any action,” an election official said.

Hinduism losing its benign face no one at top stepping in:NarimanFali S Nariman delivers a lecture on “ Minorities at Cross Roads : Comments on Judicial Pronouncements” in New Delhi on Friday. (Source: PTI)
Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: September 12, 2014 10:14 pm | Updated: September 13, 2014 8:08 am
Hinduism is losing its traditional tolerance because some Hindus have started believing that it is their faith that has brought them political power — and because this belief is not being challenged by “those at the top”, Fali S Nariman, one of India’s most celebrated jurists, said on Friday.
Nariman said he agreed that the “majority government at the Centre” had done nothing to stop the recent repeated tirades by individuals or groups against members of minority communities.
The eminent constitutional expert delivered the Annual Lecture at the National Commission for Minorities (NCM), titled ‘Minorities at Crossroads: Comments on Judicial Pronouncements’.
Nariman, who began the lecture by saying that he welcomed the single-party majority government at the Centre but also feared it because of “past experience with majoritarian government(s)”, said Hinduism has traditionally been the most tolerant of all Indian faiths.
“But — recurrent instances of religious tension fanned by fanaticism and hate speech has shown that the Hindu tradition of tolerance is showing signs of strain. And let me say this frankly — my apprehension is that Hinduism is somehow changing its benign face because, and only because it is believed and proudly proclaimed by a few (and not contradicted by those at the top): that it is because of their faith and belief that HINDUS have been now put in the driving seat of governance,” he said.
[Underlining and capitals Nariman’s; text of the speech made available by the Ministry of Minority Affairs.]
“We have been hearing on television and reading in newspapers almost on a daily basis a tirade by one or more individuals or groups against one or another section of citizens who belong to a religious minority and the criticism has been that the majority government at the Centre has done nothing to stop this tirade,” Nariman said. “I agree.”
BJP MP Yogi Adityanath has delivered a series of speeches at election meetings in the recent past, for which the Election Commission reprimanded and cautioned him on Thursday, and ordered that an FIR be registered against him. RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat has described India as a “Hindu nation”, and several political leaders linked to the Sangh Parivar have made allegedly provocative statements since the Narendra Modi government came to power.
Nariman criticised the NCM for not carrying out its “main task”, the “protection of the interests of the minorities”.
“Every government…will do or not do whatever it considers expedient to advance its own political interests… This is why…Parliament has…set up an independent Minorities Commission…
“…The main task of the Commission is ‘protecting the interests of minorities’. And how does one protect the interest of minorities who (or a section of which) are on a daily basis lampooned and ridiculed or spoken against in derogatory language? The answer is by invoking continued…

BJP tried to contact 15 AAP MLAs  we have recordings in several cases  saysSisodiaAam Aadmi party leader Manish Sisodia at the Indian Express idea exchange in New Delhi on Sept 12th 2014. (Source: Express photo by Ravi Kanojia.)

After alleging that the BJP offered money to Aam Aadmi Party MLA Dinesh Mohaniya to resign, AAP leader Manish Sisodia on Friday said that his party had conducted more such “sting operations”. At an Indian Express Idea Exchange programme, Sisodia said that “around 15 MLAs” were approached by the BJP, and that the AAP would release videos to back this at a later stage.
“Yes, we have certain recordings, but I can’t reveal this in Idea Exchange right now. The only thing I will say is that they tried to contact around 15 of our MLAs, out of which for three or four, they believed, would break away. One of them must have been Dinesh Mohaniya,” Sisodia said. The AAP had released a video on Monday which purportedly showed Delhi BJP vice-president Sher Singh Dagar talking with Mohaniya, the AAP MLA from Sangam Vihar, about resigning in exchange for money.

Following the incident, the BJP had issued a showcause notice to Dagar. Explaining how AAP MLAs were allegedly approached by the BJP, Sisodia said, “They first come to our MLAs’ office, then go back, the sequence is like that. We have not told our MLAs to go to BJP MLAs and knock at their doors for conducting stings, but it is obvious our MLAs are being approached. It begins with a small-level worker approaching our MLAs, that is the sequence… We have recordings in several cases.”
Responding to Amit Shah’s comment that a junior-level worker’s actions should not be considered a reflection of the party’s stand, Sisodia said, “The state V-P is not a lower-level worker.”
With Delhi under President’s rule since the AAP government resigned after 49 days in power, Sisodia attacked Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung for not dissolving the Assembly so that fresh elections could take place.
“Of everything LG sir has done till now, the letter written by him was the most shocking for us. In his letter, instead of expressing his opinion, he has expressed his wish… He already knows what the situation is. Twenty-seven MLAs of the Assembly are filing complaints that these are the practices that are being followed, there are attempts for horse trading, attempts to threaten MLAs. He should take into account the fact that 27 MLAs are writing to him. He hasn’t considered this at all.

Instead, he just looked at the mathematics, seen which is the single largest party, and tried to give them an option once. That is not correct. Instead, he could have apprised the president of the entire situation, he could have told him that on one side, this is the largest party, and on the other side, AAP’s 27 MLAs have continued…
Around 15 MLAs”were approached by the BJP, and that the AAP would release videos to back this at a later stage.

Court pulls up CBI for closure report in coal allocation case againstHindalcoPrint
Written by Kaunain Sherrif | New Delhi | Posted: September 12, 2014 9:53 pm
A Delhi court on Friday pulled up the CBI over the closure report filed in a coal block allocation case against Kumar Mangalam Birla-owned Hindalco after the investigating agency told the court that the original minutes of screening committee meeting, in which Hindalco’s application seeking coal blocks was taken up, were “missing”.
Special Judge Bharat Parashar told the CBI that it should “keep its house in order”, failing which the court would start “start imposing cost on the top officials of the CBI and deduct the cost from their salaries”. Stating that the CBI had made a “mockery” of the closure report, Parashar asked the agency why it was in a “hurry” to file one.
The agency, which informed the court that primary evidence containing original minutes of the screening committee meeting was missing, was asked by the judge to submit written documents to back the same. “Show if there was any statement which says that original minutes of the meeting of the screening committee were missing… did you think the court will accept the closure report with closed eyes?” Parashar said.
The investigation officer (IO), who failed to submit the primary evidence containing original minutes of the meeting, had submitted secondary evidence in support of the closure report, saying that the “relevant” bank officials have authenticated the same.
The court responded: “Can a bank official authenticate the documents of the Coal Ministry? What provisions of the law prevented you take authentication from the ministry officials. How can you submit secondary evidence like this?”
Court proceedings then saw another twist as the judge ordered the IO to get the police file and the case diary within an hour from its Delhi headquarters, based on which the agency had initiated the preliminary enquiry into the case. “What kind of investigation have you done? What was the supervisory officer (SO) doing? Bring the police file and case diary and call your supervisory officer to the court now,” the judge told to the IO.
The SO, who then appeared before the court, was told: “You have a legal department. I am sure you have consulted them before filing the closure report. When you filed the report, have you at least made sure that it is legally sustainable?”
The court questioned the SO further and asked whether the agency had “analysed” the facts of the case according to the evidence Act. “You have collected the facts and suddenly jumped to a conclusion. My query is, did you even understand the facts of the case according to the evidence Act before coming to a conclusion? Every chargesheet should run like a story. There is no sequence in your story,” the special judge said.
The court also asked the CBI if the Coal Ministry followed guidelines laid down for coal block allocation and added, “Tell me if there was any deviation in coal block allocation to Hindalco. If any, was it within the permissible limits? Your closure report is silent on this,” the court said. The court also asked the CBI to explain why continued…

2G row: Now  Kamal Nath says Manmohan might have erredComments
A day after former CAG Vinod Rai attacked Manmohan Singh on the 2G issue, ex-commerce minister Kamal Nath too questioned the former prime minister, saying he may have made a mistake in not acting despite his letter to him expressing concern over the spectrum allocation process.
“He may have made a mistake. I would go along with you. I brought it to his notice. He did not understand the import and he did not act,” he told a TV channel.
As Nath stepped up attack on the former PM, the Congress defended Singh. But Rai’s remarks gave fresh ammunition to BJP, which claimed the former CAG’s statement only confirmed what the party had been saying about dual power centre in the previous UPA government and the then PM’s failure to act.
“The 2G, CWG, Robert Vadra’s dubious land transactions, coal block allocation scam and Air India scam — all happened right under the nose of the then PM, but he did not act. The former CAG’s statement only confirms what the BJP had been saying all along,” information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar said.
The senior BJP leader said that the former PM and the Congress leadership can not shirk their responsibility and need to answer some serious questions raised by the former CAG.
Javadekar said Rai’s claims about tapping of his phone and pressure built on him not to name the former PM in his reports were very serious allegations.
Congress sought to turn the tables on Rai and asked why he did not file an FIR if some pressure was brought upon him not to name Singh in the two scandals. Alleging political motive, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said these are nothing but “rejected allegations primarily made by Subramanian Swamy”.

Attorney: S.C. father accused of killing five children needs mental health treatmentBy Sarah Larimer September 12 Follow @slarimer

Timothy Roy Jones Jr., the South Carolina father accused of killing his five children and dumping their remains in trash bags, appeared “shaken and distressed” after he was transported from Mississippi for a court hearing, a lawyer familiar with the case said Friday.
“He definitely needs mental health treatment,” Aimee Zmroczek said in a phone interview with The Post. Jones, she said, was “very tearful.”

Zmroczek was retained by the family of Jones, who has been served with arrest warrants for five counts of murder in the deaths of his children . She said she won’t represent Jones as the case progresses.
“They’re just concerned that he’s already been judged regardless, without any investigation into the why,” Zmroczek said of Jones’s relatives who retained her. The media coverage of the case and the public’s response to it has troubled the family, she said.
“Let it be known that people will come to their own conclusions and as parents, we can understand that decision based on the circumstances,” Jones’s father, Timothy Jones Sr., told reporters this week, according to the State newspaper . “But please remember that our Little Tim is a very loving father, brother and son.”
A message left with the attorney representing Jones in the case was not immediately returned.
Arrest warrants for Jones, 32, allege that he killed the five children “by violent means” at his home, the Lexington County sheriff’s department said in a statement . He was stopped at a Mississippi traffic checkpoint earlier this month .
Authorities say Jones confessed to the slayings, then led investigators to the remains of the children — ages 1 to 8 — in Alabama.
“This is a very tragic situation,” Michael Jackson, the district attorney in Alabama’s Wilcox County, told the Associated Press this week . “These kids’ lives were snuffed out before they had a chance to enjoy life. Justice will be served.”
Earlier this week, the South Carolina Department of Social Services released case files on the Jones family and said it had received three reports about the children. Their first investigation, for neglect, started in 2011. This year, they received a report alleging that Jones was physically abusing his children. A second report of abuse followed a few months later.
“General or specific observations or impressions: Dad appears to be overwhelmed as he is unable to maintain the home,” an Aug. 13 social services case document said, “but the children appear to be clean, groomed and appropriately dressed.”

Kashmir floods call for national response: SCflood
Govt. should consider setting up a “unified agency ”
The Supreme Court said the “massive floods in Kashmir valley have created horror” and that a disaster of such magnitude deserves that the entire nation reach out to bring immediate relief to the victims.
“It needs no emphasis from us that a calamity and disaster as huge as this deserves a national response so that immediate relief is made available to the flood victims,” a three-judge Bench led by Chief Justice of India R.M. Lodha said in an order on Friday.
Though the court fully acknowledged that the Central government would take “all necessary steps” to reach the distressed in the Valley, it asked the government to consider setting up a “unified agency to co-ordinate rescue, relief and rehabilitation operations.”
The Bench, also comprising Justices Kurian Joseph and Rohinton Nariman, was hearing petitions filed by senior advocates Colin Gonsalves and Bhim Singh that over 400 villages were affected and 5 lakh people were still stranded due to the deluge.
Mr. Gonsalves, in a note handed over to the court, said eight districts – Kulgam, Anantnag, Shopian, Pulwama, Ganderbal, Baramulla, Budgam and Srinagar – were gravely affected by the floods.
The Bench posted the matter for September 15.

Pre-Diwali elections in Haryana  MaharashtraComments
Single-phase assembly elections will be held in Maharashtra and Haryana on October 15, nearly five months after the BJP came to power at the Centre with an absolute majority. Counting of votes will be held on October 19, making it a relatively short poll process.
An aggressive campaign by now Prime Minister Narendra Modi saw the Congress being decimated to its lowest ever tally of 44 in the summer general elections. Though the Congress and its allies turned the tables on the BJP-led NDA in recent state bypolls, the Maharashtra and Haryana polls will be the first major electoral test of the BJP and the Modi government.
The BJP is hoping to repeat its Lok Sabha performance in both Congress-ruled states: the NDA had won 42 of 48 Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra, and seven out of 10 in Haryana. It may be helped by the anti-incumbency factor, but soaring prices remains a critical issue.
Also, both the Congress and BJP are facing trouble from their allies with the NCP and Shiv Sena, respectively, haggling for a bigger slice of the seat-sharing pie in Maharashtra, which has 288 assembly seats.
Similar disagreements over seat-sharing in Haryana led to the BJP losing a partner, the Haryana Janhit Congress, recently. Most of the state’s 90 assembly seats are expected to witness multi-corned contests.
The immediate challenge for parties is to prepare for a reduced election period. Compared to the 40-45 days earlier polls took, starting from the announcement of dates to the counting of votes, the entire process in Haryana and Maharashtra will be completed in 39 days.
Election Commission officials, who announced the poll dates on Friday, said the process had been squeezed so that there would be minimal impact on the festival season in late October. This will also mean that the model code of conduct will be in force for the lowest possible period.

This article originally appeared in Business Insider.
Hundreds of people (mostly men) packed the house at the 92nd Street Y in Manhattan's Upper East Side to see the real-life "Wolf of Wall Street," Jordan Belfort.

Belfort is the author of a best-selling tell-all memoir that chronicled his boozy, drug-fueled, high-flying Wall Street lifestyle running 1990s-era boiler room Stratton Oakmont. The convicted felon’s book was adapted into a film directed by Martin Scorsese starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Belfort was arrested in 1998. In 2003, he was convicted for securities fraud and money laundering. He served a 22-month prison sentence after being sentenced to four years. He was also  ordered to pay $110.4 million  in restitution to victims of Stratton Oakmont's. He  hasn't finished paying them back yet , either.
Wednesday night's "Trial & Error" program at the Y was co-produced by NYU Law's Forum on Law, Culture & Society. In addition to Belfort, the panel featured former federal prosecutor Daniel Alonso and CNBC anchor Kelly Evans. The program was produced by attorney Joel Seidemann. He's a former assistant district attorney in New York. His LinkedIn profile says he now works at JPMorgan Chase. 
Seidemann gave a train wreck of an introduction. It really set the tone for the evening, which was uncomfortable. First, he joked that there wouldn't be any "scantily clad girls" at the event. "It's just going to be stimulation from the neck up." He also threw in a Casey Anthony and O.J. Simpson joke.
"We never had a defendant who was actually convicted. It's not for lack of trying. ... I did invite Casey Anthony, but she was looking for Zanny the Nanny. We did invite O.J., but he wouldn't leave his gated community in Nevada." 
It gets worse ... 
Then, he introduced CNBC anchor Kelly Evans. It was awkward: He said something along the lines of "We need a fox on this panel of wolves." 
There was some laughter and some boos from the audience. "Sexissssst huh-huh-huh," the guy in the suit next to me said. "It's not easy for anyone to be associated with the word 'fox,'" Seidemann went on rambling something about Fox News.
Evans, 29, is the star anchor at CNBC. She's incredibly smart and commands the respect of the biggest names on the Street with her coverage of economics and the financial markets. We reached out to Seidemann on Thursday morning for comment about his introduction of Evans. He did not respond at the time of publication. 
Professor Thane Rosenbaum, who was the forum's director and panel's moderator, reached out to apologize, even though the comments didn't come from him. "I'm really sorry about all of it. I surely would not have invited Kelly for the forum to have her offended. It was very hard to sit on stage and watch that. I was truly sorry." Evans had no comment when Business Insider reached out. Despite the cringeworthy intro, Evans handled herself with incredible poise throughout the entire panel. 
The panel began with Belfort saying it was "strange" for him to be at the 92nd Street Y, especially because he wasn't being paid. "Listen, you know, it's kind of a strange situation for me to be here. You know, I go around the world and I'm a speaker and I teach people entrepreneurship, sales, and that sort of stuff for a living. And, so, um I know I'm going to subject myself to a lot of I guess border-line abuse here. Start very quickly. It's very negative here ... " 
"Well, you weren't called a 'fox,' " Rosenbaum, the panel moderator, said referring to the intro for Evans.
Belfort, who slouched in his seat, complained that he wasn't being paid for this appearance. "I have to say that I have to sit here and listen to this when I'm not getting paid is pretty tough," Belfort said as the audience began laughing. 
Belfort is currently on a global speaking tour, which has been dubbed the "Redemption Tour." He  estimated earlier this year that he thought he could make more than $100 million.
"In my heart, I've redeemed myself," he said. "I live my life in a way in which I am very proud of. I do the right thing every day. I give massive value to my business. I pay a lot more than you said. Your numbers are wildly inaccurate."
"Let's talk ..." Rosenbaum said.
Belfort didn't want to get into the numbers. "Honestly, I can't talk about my finances. I came here to answer questions that were really relevant to the crime, OK? It's a waste of time, I think, OK? So frankly ... but your numbers are grossly inaccurate," Belfort fired back.
"Let's talk about those numbers. It's important to talk about those numbers," Rosenbaum said.
Evans said that she was worried about "the next Jordan Belfort." 
"There's somebody somewhere who is thinking this is going to be great material one day," she said. 
Belfort said people should realize that the actions portrayed in the film were bad and not something they should follow. "If you're in this audience and you can't go to see The Wolf of Wall Street and realize that that's bad, then there's something wrong with you. You are fundamentally screwed up. It's obvious," Belfort said. Belfort said that he idolized Gordon Gekko's character in Oliver Stone's Wall Street . He said that had perhaps Gekko fallen, then he would have felt differently. "At least in The Wolf of Wall Street, I lose everything. My life is destroyed. I go to jail," Belfort said.
Evans didn't buy Belfort's argument of his story being a cautionary tale. "I don't think your story is a movie—we're living this story right now. I don't think there are many people who look at 'poor Jordan Belfort' and think, 'Wow, this is a cautionary tale.' He sold out the 92nd Street Y! He's going on a 45-city tour and he's got a TV series that he's ... what?" Evans said. 
Belfort insisted that people like his redemption story. "I did that because I turned my life around over the last year. I'm not out committing crimes right now. People want to believe in redemption stories," Belfort said, adding that the way he lives his life now gives people hope. 
Evans wasn't buying it. "The reason why people press you on your finances is because there's not a real sense that this is a redemption story. There's a sense that this is a story of, 'Wow, look at this thing I did, the time that I served, but I turned it around now and now I'm telling you about it and ..." Evans said.
"People don't press me; journalists do," Belfort fired back to laughter and applause. Evans pointed out that was "selling that story successfully." 
"Should I sell it unsuccessfully?" he said, to more laughs and applause.

Later in the discussion, Evans made a reference to Timothy 6:10, where the Bible says "the love of money is the root of all evil." Belfort responded: "This idea of money as the root of evil is ridiculous. Money is like alcohol. If you're an a--hole, it makes you a bigger a--hole." Belfort added that he liked making money. He also said that he didn't think he should live his life like a monk despite his actions in the past. 

Have right to intervene if FRAviolatedPrint
Written by Amitabh Sinha | New Delhi | Posted: September 13, 2014 12:37 am
While two of his ministerial colleagues have asked him to withdraw his objections to a Maharashtra government notification on management of forest villages, Tribal Affairs Minister Jual Oram Friday asserted that his ministry had a right to intervene if any law or rule was made in conflict to the Forest Rights Act.
“My ministry’s mandate is to ensure the implementation of the Forest Rights Act. We will have to step in when we feel that any state government or other body is making rules that are in contravention to the provisions of the Forest Rights Act,” Oram told The Indian Express.
Rural Development Minister Nitin Gadkari and Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar had, in separate communications, asked Oram to withdraw a order of his ministry instructing the Maharashtra government to hold “in abeyance” a set of rules it had framed for the management of forest villages in the state. The Tribal Affairs Ministry had argued that the rules framed by the Maharashtra government were “prima facie in violation” of the Forest Rights Act, which gives people living in forests legal property rights over their land and many forest products.
Both Gadkari and Javadekar had told Oram that since the Maharashtra government had framed rules under the Indian Forest Act of 1927, which is administered by the Environment Ministry, the Tribal Affairs Ministry did not have any jurisdiction to raise objection.
But Oram, who has not withdrawn the order, argued otherwise. “It is true that the Indian Forest Act is not under my ministry. But the Forest Rights Act is. And if my ministry feels that any other law can potentially come in conflict with the FRA, it is duty-bound to intervene,” he said.
Oram said he had received the communication from both his Cabinet colleagues and had called for legal advice and consultation to sort out the matter amicably.

Govt calls meet on DBT scheme  may take itforwardPrint
Written by Ruhi Tewari | New Delhi | Posted: September 13, 2014 12:33 am
Signalling its intention to pick up the pieces on the Congress-led UPA government’s ambitious Direct Benefits Transfer (DBT) scheme, and of taking it forward as well as expanding its coverage, the government is holding a key meeting to review the current status of the scheme on Monday.
According to sources in ministries whose schemes are linked to DBT, the meeting that has been convened by the Finance Ministry seeks to review the status and implementation of DBT and schemes under it in the 121 districts where the previous government had introduced it. This follows a high-level meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on September 6 where he reviewed the progress in Aadhaar.
The meeting, to be chaired by Secretary, Expenditure, will be attended by representatives of other concerned ministries, including Rural Development, Human Resource Development, Minority Affairs, Tribal Affairs and Petroleum and Natural Gas, among others. DBT was rolled out in over 25 schemes in 2013.
The sources say after giving a definite push to Aadhaar and drawing up a roadmap wherein a 100 crore enrolment target by 2015 has been set, the government is now keen to work on DBT, after assessing the current statues. The Modi-led government, sources say, is considering expanding the scheme’s rollout from 121 to 300 districts.
In July, the PMO had directed the Planning Commission to gather information about Aadhaar with respect to five key government schemes — MGNREGA, pensions, scholarships, Public Distribution System and LPG in 300 priority districts. The 300 priority districts are those where Aadhaar enrolment is currently 60-70 per cent or more.
It is in these 300 districts the government plans to expand the coverage of DBT.
The DBT scheme, launched by the UPA with much ado, had failed to take off owing to gaps in implementation and inadequate monitoring.

EC order against former Maharashtra CM setasidePrint
Written by Aneesha Mathur , with input from  pti 5    | New Delhi | Posted: September 13, 2014 12:30 am
The Delhi High Court Friday set aside the show-cause notice issued by the Election Commission (EC) against former Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan for allegedly failing to submit a proper account of expenses for the Assembly elections in 2009.
The court of Justice Suresh Kait in its 101-page order also analysed the provisions of law relating to election offences and said the EC did not conduct the inquiry properly as it did not take note of the evidence regarding whether Chavan could be legally held to have “authorised” the advertisements issued by party workers.
“This court is of the considered opinion that the Commission has failed on both counts, that is, by not complying with the Rule-89(6) of the Rules and not framing the issue regarding knowledge and consent of the petitioner or his agent on the expenses incurred on advertisements in question. Moreover, no evidence was brought on record before writing its opinion against the petitioner. Therefore, I set aside the impugned order dated 13.07.2014 and consequential order to issue show-cause notice under Rule-89(5) of the Rules,” said Kait.
During the Maharashtra Assembly elections in October 2009, a series of advertisements regarding public meetings to be held by UPA leaders and campaigners were taken out in various local publications. According to the notice issued by the EC, Chavan had failed to account for expenses of over Rs 16,000 spent on some of these advertisements, thereby violating the provisions of the law.
The High Court, however, accepted Chavan’s argument that the expenses had been made without his knowledge by local Congress leaders and the same could not be held to have been “authorised” by him.
Earlier, former law minister and senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who also represented Chavan, had contended that his client had filed all correct poll expenses and had incurred an expenditure of Rs 6.85 lakh in the 2009 Assembly elections. Chavan had won the 2009 Assembly polls from Bhokar in Maharashtra’s Nanded Lok Sabha constituency. He won the recent Lok Sabha polls from Nanded.
Earlier, the Supreme Court had asked the high court to decide Chavan’s plea within 15 days while refusing to interfere with its July 28 decision staying the show-cause notice issued to Chavan on July 13. The apex court had said it was not in favour of the matter dragging and that the High Court should decide the question of law.

NRI Investments in Realty May Rise 35% in 2014: SurveyFree Diesel Prices at the Earliest: RBI Governor
New Delhi: Property developers are expecting a 35 per cent surge in real estate enquiries from NRIs (non-resident Indians) with Bangalore turning out to be a favourite, according to a survey by the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham).
To tap the growing interest, which comes at a time when the global economy is stabilising and India is showing strong signs of revival, real estate companies here are pulling out all the stops by conducting property shows, exhibitions and opening overseas representative offices.
Developers are also expanding their existing distribution chains and entering into strategic partnerships to encourage investors from this cash-rich segment, the industry body said.
The survey was conducted among nearly 850 real estate developers in Delhi-NCR, Chandigarh, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Pune, Dehradun, Chennai etc.
Bangalore was the most favourite property investment destination for NRIs, followed by Ahmedabad, Pune, Chennai, Goa, Delhi and Dehradun, the survey showed.
The enquiries are primarily coming from NRIs residing in the UAE, the US, Singapore, Australia, the UK, Canada and South Africa.
This year, demand is more for the high-end property and commercial buildings, developers say.
"With the revival in global economy, especially in the United States and Europe, people are more optimistic and looking for property to invest in."
"Both small and big developers are focusing on the NRI base in the US, the UK and Asia Pacific region this year," Assocham Secretary General D S Rawat said.
As per the findings of the survey, Ahemdabad (32 per cent) continued to be the most stable market in terms of demand and absorption of both residential and commercial spaces.
NRIs consider Ahmedabad as a safe place to invest in, with lenient government regulations for property investments. Pune was at the third position (30.5 per cent), as per the survey, whereas Chennai (28 per cent) was at the 4th spot and Goa (23 per cent) at the 5th place.
In Delhi, there has been a 21 per cent rise in enquiries this year as opposed to last year  and a majority of them have been for the residential segment.
Catering to the growing demand in the high-end segment, Delhi has also emerged among the promising markets for real estate, the survey showed.

Characteristics of an Entrepreneurreddit
Characteristics of an Entrepreneur and Creating Success
Here are some great tips to get you started. Look for mentors that are already successful, who have had their own failures and have made a comeback to create success. Following successful mentors and associating with positive people is key to your journey in building characteristics of an entrepreneur.
You will always have setbacks on your journey; this is where experienced mentors can help you set a different approach and get your mind set off the things you do not want.
Characteristics of an Entrepreneur and Meditation
A form of meditation is very powerful. Do not miss this point as most people say meditation is not for them. You will be surprised what power there is in a relaxed state of mind. The power is endless just like the universe.
Here is a great quote -- "I am one with the universe and it is one with me. I am of it, with in it, and exist as a shining spark in a firmament of divine goodness," -- from a book I read, What to Say When You Talk to Yourself by Shad Helmstetter.
I have a great story to share with you that can help you develop characteristics of an entrepreneur and help you on your journey to create success. I believe whatever business you do as an entrepreneur you will have days where you want to quit and throw in the towel.
Belief and Persistence Builds Characteristics of an Entrepreneur
I read an article about a piano player who wanted to play as a concert pianist. In the beginning he did not play well at all, but he practiced every day and was determined to get better.
He bought the necessary books and kept practicing even though he "sucked" in the beginning of his journey. But in his own mind he had the desire to succeed and not to quit.
All success comes from some form of "grind," so keep doing what you are doing, believe you will get better and you will find results.
And, yes, now this pianist plays in front of 20,000 people, and he did so by believing and practicing his craft day in and day out until he mastered it.
Characteristics of an Entrepreneur -- Skateboarder
What about the skateboarder in the park? I have heard that some of these kids practice one trick 400 times to get it perfect. Do not quit at your first defeat; this is where you learn all those valuable lessons. Keep going. This is just part of the journey to success and part of building characteristics of an entrepreneur.
There are no shortcuts to creating success, besides hard work and determination. I work from home, and I have had my ups and downs, but I do what is necessary every day to get better and reach great success.
Do not quit on your dream. Keep moving forward and your struggles will build your character and help others to succeed when you tell them your story.

SMALL PRESS EXPO: Dean Haspiels Fear  My Dear is a hard-boiled dish  best served boldDean Haspiel’s “Fear, My Dear: A Billy Dogma Experience” (Z2 Comics)
 
LAST MONTH, I sat in a darkened theater, all alone, to screen a preview of “Frank Miller’s Sin City: A Dame to Kill For.” Rarely have I longed so much to have another person in the multiplex — anyone — to crack a joke or breathe a little warmth into this airless experience.
It’s not that “Sin City” 2 isn’t a visual stunner like its forebear; the adapted comic-book aesthetic is stylish as hell. And there are performances — particularly those of Eva Green and Powers Boothe — that command the painted green-screen. But O, for a whiff or whisper of true humor amid the Bludgeon Noir. Something to shed a little humanity amid the white-as-gesso bloodshed. Because here’s the catch, see–here’s what I got wise to:
Great noir not only thinks. It winks.
Regrettably, “Sin City” 2 is too busy depicting the visual viscera of gouged-out eyes to really wink, verbally or otherwise. Which is odd, because a few days later, Frank Miller and I talked about our love of classic film-noir like “Double Indemnity,” in which Barbara Stanwyck delivers a master class in playing the femme fatale with buoyantly delicious evil. The crisp, brisk dialogue doesn’t just bristle with relatable emotion; it pops. Like the sound of a Luger pointed at the human heart.
What I eventually realized was: What I longed for was a little less “Sin City: A Dame to Kill For” and a fair bit more Trip City: A Dame to Thrill More. What I wanted was the knowing wit of Dean Haspiel’s tough-guy-with-tear-ducts character, Billy Dogma.
Part of the trick of cooking up hard-boiled fare, of course, is not to over-cook it; to trap in some of that warmth. Fortunately, Haspiel the storyteller knows not only how to simmer the ingredients in a dead-pan, but also how to control the flame.
In this case, the flame is the five-alarm relationship between “the last romantic anti-hero,” Billy Dogma, and his co-fighter in all realms, tough Jane Legit (no matter the foe, she’s forever too Legit to quit). They share crimes of passion and a passion for crimes. (Both their brawling and their, um, lovemaking are graphic; they bare knuckles one minute, then bare their souls and selves to the strains of Prince the next.)
Haspiel’s new book, “Fear, My Dear” (Z2 Comics), combines two stories: The title tale — a poignant father-son narrative about wrenching memories, powerful legacy and the way of the gun — and “Immortal,” a monochromatic, fiery-red adventure about the perils of passion run amok, as well as the uplifting power of forgiveness and heartfelt altruism.
“Fear, My Dear” — a title that has the right ring of a Robert Mitchum or Joseph Cotten noir film — is a lush, hardbound way to experience the romantic ties that bind. Billy Dogma gained traction in the ’90s as a webcomic, and the years have only deepened this character for the better.
Haspiel, the Brooklyn-based, Emmy-winning cartoonist, has said that Billy Dogma is an avatar for himself, and so it’s fitting that as Haspiel’s powers have matured at middle age, so have those of Billy the brute philosopher. The Eisner-nominated Haspiel — so known for his fruitful collaborations with Mark Waid ( The Fox ), Jonathan Ames (The Alcoholic), Inverna Lockpez (Cuba: My Revolution) and Harvey Pekar ( The Quitter ) — seems to pour a career’s worth of gathering craft into “Fear, My Dear.”
On the level of language, Haspiel deftly rides the line between hard noir and playful camp. In the book’s foreword, his former Keyhole mate Josh Neufeld (“A.D.: New Orleans After the Deluge”) writes that “Fear, My Dear’s” fast patter is “part hard-boiled slang, part beat poetry.” Haspiel definitely cooks his verbal gumbo with accents of Kerouac and a dash of Hammett, but there are also the best strains of ’60s Stan Lee and even ’70s Bruce Springsteen. As even the Boss knows, you can’t sing about wrapping your legs around a fella’s velvet rims without winking to the crowd about letting your metaphor run into the red. When Haspiel waxes rhapsodic about “the war of woo” and Jane pulling her hips “up to [Billy's] bumper,” his tongue — like wild-man Billy’s — is firmly planted in cheek. (It’s just a matter of whose cheek.)
The in-our-face lingo matches the bold strokes of Haspiel’s art. Told mostly in four-panel grids, “Fear, My Dear” nods to Kirby and Ditko, but Haspiel has honed his own seductive knack for blending the sloping curves with squared-off lines — and the thick, dark hatching befits the hard-boiled. Billy Dogma’s Gibraltar of a torso, for example, is worthy of Ben Grimm or Sgt. Rock — and flexes with that same superheroic panache to match the dialogue. When a character (or even a creator) so often goes shirtless, after all, he’s got to wink slyly to pull it off.
What Haspiel mostly achieves, though, is dramatizing the height of emotion at every turn — the narrative is about leaping from peak to fraught peak. In all this madness, there is a method. The cartoonist has said that through Billy Dogma and Jane Legit, he is reflecting “the insanity of love.” And so this thrill ride must push our buttons using every storyteller’s tool, from language to line to allusion.
As Springsteen himself sang at full throat and throttle: “I’ll love you with all the madness in my soul.”
May Billy Dogma never stop running.
 
DEAN HASPIEL will appear this weekend in North Bethesda at Small Press Expo .
MICHAEL CAVNA will appear on the SPX panel “Pro Tips: How to Get Reviewed,” Saturday at 2 p.m.

Peru plans to export more gold to India this...Peru plans to export more gold to India this year; mulling FTA

(Peru, the world's sixth…)
PUNE: Peru, the world's sixth top gold producer, today said the shipment of the precious metal to India is likely to surpass USD 270 million this year.
To boost trade in gold and other commodities , the Latin American country is considering signing a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with India.
"Currently, only 0.6 per cent of India's total gold imports comes from Peru. Last year, we exported USD 270 million of gold and this year it will be slightly more," Peru Ambassador to India Javier Paulinich told reporters at 11th International Gold Convention here.
The mineral-rich country started exporting gold to India since 2012. "We entered late in direct selling of gold to India," he said.
However gold exports have increased to India due to direct selling. "We exported USD 106 million in 2012 and it rose by 150 per cent to USD 270 million in 2013," he added.
To meet rising gold demand, Paulinich said, "Three Indian investors have invested in gold mines in Peru. The numbers are expected to rise in following years."
Peru, which produced five million ounce of gold last year, is also talking seriously with the Indian government on FTA to explore potential in both nations, he said.
India, the world's largest gold importer, buys largely refined gold from overseas market. Only 10 per cent is imported in raw form.
Domestic gold refiner MMTC PAMP Managing Director Rajesh Khosla said that there is scope to increase import of gold raw material from Peru.
"Gold is a complex business. Global miners wish to enter into long term contract with internationally accredited and financially sound refiners. However talks are on," he added.
Peru produced five million ounce of gold in 2013.

World leaders readying petition to U.N. on Mission Ocean
Just before the U.N. General Assembly is to take a decision on a new agreement on high seas protection at its session starting on September 24, a petition for Mission Ocean will reach it from the world over.
In India, industrialist Ratan Tata has joined leaders from other countries in launching the petition to get signatures, and already 1,000 people have signed it.
In the petition, Mr. Tata said, “As a businessman and philanthropist, I have dedicated my life to a fairer and more just society. None of this would have been possible without the riches of a healthy, living planet, not least the ocean. For India, a healthy ocean is many things — a source of food, a means of trade, a way of life — but also, inescapably, essential for all life on Earth. Today, its resources and freedoms are being exploited at the expense of us all — especially the poorest in society. Now more than ever, better ocean governance is critical for a more equitable and just world.”
In the coming session, the United Nations will discuss the future of the high seas and how they should be governed.
The petition said the high seas — made up of international waters and covering 45 per cent of the Earth — “belong to all, yet resemble a failed state beyond the jurisdiction of any government. No one is taking overall responsibility, with the alarming result that the health of the entire ocean is in severe decline. It is time to extend the rule of law to the deep blue half of our planet.
“We need a new international agreement [under the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea] to secure ocean health and the sustainable and equitable use and conservation of high seas resources,” it added.
The target is 2,50,000 signatures and the petition already has over 2,20,000 signatures the world over, mobilised by leaders in various countries and the Global Ocean Commission.

NEW DELHI: Hitting back, Congress today sought to turn the tables on former CAG Vinod Rai asking him why he did not file an FIR if some pressure was brought upon him not to name then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the 2G and coal block allocation reports.
Alleging political motive behind his remarks, party spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said that these are nothing but "rejected allegations primarily made by Subramanian Swamy", which did not stand the scrutiny of the Supreme Court and the special CBI court.
Suggesting that the former chief auditor was in league with the BJP, he also wondered as to why he has not uttered a word on serious strictures passed by the CAG in Gujarat against the then Chief Minister Narendra Modi.
While the Congress spokesperson accused Rai of showing "unsatiated hunger for publicity" before the launch of his new book, former party MPs Sanjay Nirupam and Sanjay Dikshit, who were accused by Rai of putting pressure on him, demanded an apology from him and threatened to drag him to the court.
Coming out with a stinging criticism of former Prime Minister Singh, Rai said that integrity is not just financial but intellectual and professional.
Rai, whose loss estimates in 2G spectrum and coal block allocations pushed the then UPA government into a corner also claimed that the then Congress MPs, including Sandeep Dikshit, Sanjay Nirupam and Ashwani Kumar, had sought to put pressure on him to keep the Prime Minister's name out of the said CAG reports.
Rejecting the charge, Nirupam and Dikshit said that they were not in the Public Accounts Committee, which had given its report on the 2G scam and had joined the newly-constituted PAC much after and hence it did not make any sense to ask the then CAG to change a report, which is already in public domain.
"Neither me nor Nirupam has anything to do with the earlier PAC," Dikshit insisted wondering "Am I an idiot that I have asked somebody to change the report, which has already been published."

2 = 1  for sufficiently small values of 2A commenter combines the desecration of venerated objects post and the 15-year sentence for possessing shotgun shells nearly 20 years after a felony conviction post, and writes,
A conviction under this statute would render him a prohibited person under 18 USC 922(g), and he would not be allowed to possess firearms or ammunition. The crime of desecration is punishable by more than a year in prison, so even though PA calls it a misdemeanor, for the purpose of federal firearm law, he would be a felon.
And then he had better hope he never ends up possessing a few shotgun shells when he has a run in with the police.
I appreciate the concern, but I don’t think it applies to this case, and here’s why:
1. Indeed, according to § 922(g), the federal ban on “felons” possessing guns is actually a ban on possessing guns by any person “who has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.” It thus doesn’t matter whether the person got any prison time, or whether the crime is the sort of crime we’d think is a felony, or (it appears) whether the crime is labeled a felony under state law. If a state provides that second-degree misdemeanors are punishable by up to 2 years in prison, as Pennsylvania does , then all second-degree misdemeanor criminal convictions would trigger the federal disability.
Or so it seems at first glance. At second glance, when one looks at § 921(a)(20)(B), one sees that, “The term ‘crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year’ does not include … any State offense classified by the laws of the State as a misdemeanor and punishable by a term of imprisonment of two years or less.” One is two, and two is one. We two are one . One and one and one is three . (Or is it two?) This is why we lawyers get a bad name; but in any case, it’s why there would be no disqualification even for an adult desecration-of-venerated-object conviction.
2. But 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) applies to criminal convictions. The 14-year-old in the Jesus statue case is being prosecuted in the juvenile justice system. Juvenile adjudications are in some ways treated as criminal cases, but in other ways are not. And, as best I can tell, Pennsylvania’s treatment of them means that they do not trigger the 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) disability.
“And what is your authority for that proposition, counselor?,” you might be asking. Here’s what I’ve found, though I’m open to correction if correction is required (though I hope not in a correctional institution):
a. Whether something is a “convict[ion]” of a “crime” for § 922 turns on whether the law of the jurisdiction of conviction treats it as a criminal conviction; and juvenile adjudications aren’t treated as criminal convictions if the state law provides that, “a finding of guilty on a petition charging delinquency under the provisions of this law shall not operate to impose any of the civil disabilities ordinarily imposed by conviction for a crime.” United States v. Walters (4th Cir. 2004) (discussing Virginia law). The court concluded that, because “we are persuaded that Virginia does not consider a juvenile adjudication to be a conviction,” “a juvenile adjudication cannot be the underlying conviction which subjects a person to penalty under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).”
b. Under Pennsylvania law , “An order of disposition or other adjudication in a proceeding under this chapter is not a conviction of crime and does not impose any civil disability ordinarily resulting from a conviction or operate to disqualify the child in any civil service application or appointment.”
So if I’m right, findings of guilty in Pennsylvania juvenile adjudications do not count for federal felon-in-possession law purposes.
3. Note that the federal gun possession disqualification can be lifted if a person gets his civil rights restored in the jurisdiction in which he was convicted. Such restoration ranges from well-nigh impossible to not that difficult, depending on the jurisdiction; I don’t know what the rule is in Pennsylvania, though for the reasons given above the venerated object desecrator doesn’t have to know it, either, at least as far as federal gun law is concerned.

Tougher rules set for hunting sharks  manta raysBy Darryl Fears September 12 Follow @bydarrylfears

We all know about the scary "Jaws" theme, Shark Week and stories about encounters where sharks take huge bites off surfboards -- enough to cause people to worry about the fearsome predator. But sharks could have their own theme, and when it plays, they should be on the look out for humans.
Sharks kill about five people a year, far fewer than deer , ants and dogs. But humans kill nearly one million tons of sharks every year, and that's just five different types -- oceanic whitetip, scalloped hammerhead, great hammerhead, smooth hammerhead, and porbeagle. Noting this imbalance, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wildlife Fauna and Flora, known as CITES, announced more aggressive steps to protect them Friday.
CITES
Starting Sunday, most of the 180 nations that are members of CITES will require fishermen to get permits to hunt these sharks for their fins and meat to bring them ashore. The same goes for manta rays, which the body also moved to protect. CITES called the regulations the most comprehensive in its 40-year history to protect sharks and rays.
If fishermen dock with specimens of the "five shark species and all manta ray species, including their meat, gills and fins," they will need to have "permits and certificates confirming that they have been harvested sustainably and legally," CITES said in a statement.
Scalloped hammerhead sharks in particular are zealously hunted for their fins and meat. The most recent stock assessment in 2009, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, found that its population across the world fell from 155,000 in 1981 to about 26,000 in 2005, an alarming decline that landed it on the endangered species list, the first shark species ever placed there.
Manta rays are a delicacy in some nations, so fishermen are known to spear them, hook them and cut away their gills before tossing the carcasses back into the ocean. That's problematic because the rays reproduce very slowly, birthing fewer than one cub per year. By and large, they no longer swim in great schools, but in scattered populations across the world.
“Regulating international trade in these shark and manta ray species is critical to their survival," CITES Secretary-General John Scanlon, said. By protecting the fish, governments are also protecting "the biodiversity of our oceans."

Malalas attackers arrested: Pakistan Armypeople
The 10 Taliban militants who tried to kill Pakistani teenage activist Malala Yousufzai for her outspoken views on girls’ education in the country’s troubled northwest in 2012 have been arrested, the Army announced on Friday.
Ms. Malala, then 15, was shot in her head by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) gunmen in October 2012 in northwestern Swat valley.
She has since recovered from the assault , which shocked the world and catapulted her to international fame for her courageous and determined fight for education rights to all children.
Two of her colleagues were also injured in the attack.
Director General of Inter Services Public Relations (DG ISPR) Asim Saleem Bajwa said the 10 arrested militants have revealed that the mastermind of the attack on the schoolgirls was TTP commander Mullah Fazlullah.
“This was an intelligence-led operation, and police were also involved in the case,” Mr. Bajwa was quoted as saying by the Express Tribune.
Mr. Bajwa said the group of the arrested militants hail from Malakand, close to Mingora, the main town of Swat where Ms. Malala was attacked.
The arrests came as part of the Pakistani military’s ongoing all-out assault on the TTP and other militant outfits in North Waziristan.
Ms. Malala, after narrowly surviving the assassination bid, was taken to Britain with her family for treatment.
She now lives in Birmingham, where she was flown for specialist treatment after the shooting.
She came to public attention in 2009 when she wrote a diary for BBC Urdu about life under Taliban militants who had taken control of the valley.
The teenage activist was named one of Time magazine’s most influential persons of 2013, and was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. She has also released an autobiography recently.
In July last year, her address to the U.N. General Assembly where she vowed she would never be silenced earned her a standing ovation.
She was awarded the E.U.’s prestigious Sakharov human rights prize last year.

Delhi confidential: STAFF ONNOTICEExpress News Service | Posted: September 13, 2014 12:54 am
Prime Minister Narendra Modi may have issued clear instructions to clean up government offices but, in the Health Ministry, the message does not seem to have sunk in yet. Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan found this a few days ago when he made an inspection of the ministry’s offices in Nirman Bhavan and found broken glass, tiles, dusty old files and rooms that are so unkempt that they are potential fire hazards. An upset minister has given a week’s time to brush up space. He would undertake an inspection again soon. Meanwhile, on Friday when he was to return from Dhaka, the corridor leading to his office on the third floor had been spruced up with fresh plants.
BRAINSTORMING
It seems to be a busy period for the higher education sector. While HRD Minister’s retreat with vice-chancellors of 39 central universities is currently on in Chandigarh and the IIT Council is set to meet on September 22, a big meeting has been called by the University Grants Commission in Delhi Monday. The UGC meet will see principals of 250 deemed/ private colleges deliberate on, among other things, regulatory issues.
SEARCH IS ON
The search for a successor to the Coal India chairman after Narsing Rao joined the Telangana government is still on. While names were floated for some time, the government is understood to have decided to set up a search committee independent of the Public Enterprise Selection Board that normally does the job. A strong contender at this stage is learnt to be Arup Roy Choudhury, the current CMD of NTPC.
OFF LIMITS
The flood of ticket seekers have made the main office at the BJP headquarters inaccessible for many visitors. The office, where the office-bearers sit, used to be open to journalists but now only those who have special permission to meet any of the leaders can get in. According to the office staff, the entry into the office will be restricted till all the candidates for Haryana Assembly elections are announced. They fear the ticket seekers from Haryana — hundreds of them visit the BJP headquarters every day — would push themselves into the office rooms of every leader and there could be unruly scenes as a result. The restrictions have made the ticket seekers angry and they created a scene in front of the main entrance Friday. “The Hooda administration is better than this,” one of them was heard shouting.

The Number Is 800-799-SAFE -- Call ItHere's the telephone number:
1-800-799-SAFE.
Grab a pencil, write it on a post-it note, put it in plain view, memorize it. It's the National Domestic Violence Hotline, and if you're being abused, they can help you. They'll pick you up, they'll take you -- and your children, if you have them -- to a domestic violence shelter or to another kind of safe house. It won't be your parents' house or your best friend's house, because he'll know where that is, and you'll be putting those people in jeopardy, too. But the people on the other end of the line will help you. They know what you're going through, and they'll take you to safety.
"And that's where your life will start again," domestic violence expert Dr. Jill Murray , told me on Tuesday. "It won't be the life that you once had with the guy. You will be safe, you'll be alive and you'll be able to live the rest of your life and raise your children."
I had called Dr. Murray shortly after watching the sickening video of Baltimore Raven Ray Rice, knocking his then-fiancée, Janay Palmer, out cold, last February in an Atlantic City casino elevator. Not surprisingly, the story has dominated the screaming headlines all week, ever since the video was leaked by TMZ.
"But there's really nothing new about this tragedy," Dr. Murray told me. "Nothing new at all. It's like all these guys read the same abuser handbook. They're not unique. They're just abusers, and they all do the same thing."
If you're being abused at this moment, you don't need to hear that each year 1.3 million women will be victims of domestic violence; and that one in four women will experience it in her lifetime. Knowing that is not going to stop that fist from connecting with your face. Or that knife from being held to your neck.
You're not interested in measuring your horror against some awful national trend. You just want to be safe.
So if you are experiencing violent abuse at the hands of someone close to you, someone you feel you can't escape, you need to read below what Dr. Murray told me. It could save your life.
*   *   *
"Silly Woman Thinking"
"If you are in a relationship that's emotionally or verbally abusive and thinking, 'My boyfriend or my husband would never do that to me -- yeah, maybe he calls me names, but I can deal with that' -- it is just 'silly woman thinking' to believe that it could never turn physically violent. Because physically violent relationships start with emotional and verbal abuse. You watch that video of that woman being dragged out of the elevator and think, 'Wow, that's shocking and horrible, but it won't happen to me.' Well, she probably thought that, too."
"Love is a Behavior, Not a Feeling."
"Feelings of love can be anything, depending on what you want them to be. But if you think about love as a behavior, then you cannot stay in an abusive relationship. You can't say, 'He cheats on me, therefore he loves me. He hits me, therefore he loves me. He calls me names, therefore he loves me.' It doesn't matter how many times he says, 'I love you baby -- you're the most important thing to me.' Just look at his behavior, and that will tell you what love is."
The First Signs
"These guys usually start off charming and very attentive, maybe even overly attentive. They're very focused on you, which feels good. Then slowly -- and it's really in incremental steps -- they start being jealous, and then ridiculously jealous. Like, you're not allowed to have male friends -- not even talk to them. Many women believe at first that this kind of jealousy is cute; they think he's just being protective. But soon that morphs into accusations about men, and the woman is constantly defending herself. So the jealousy is one thing to look for right away. It's not cute -- it's abusive, and it's a sign."
Morphing Into Him
"Soon he starts isolating you from your friends, from your family, from your outside activities. He says he wants to spend all of his time with you. Or he always has some sort of crisis or something that you need to manage for him -- and you feel so important because he's depending on you. So as you stop seeing your friends and family and doing your own activities, you gradually morph into his identity -- the identity he wants you to have."
It's Not Romantic
"In the beginning, all of this feels flattering and romantic. Here's a man who says he just can't live without you. Maybe he even tells you that he loves you on the second date. Or maybe he starts giving you suggestions about how you're dressing. He's not saying you look horrible or look like a tramp (yet), but he starts picking out clothes for you to wear on a date with him, and you want to look your best for him. All of this feels normal and natural, even romantic. Well, it's not normal or natural or romantic. It's creepy, abusive behavior."
The Fear Factor
"A lot of people say, 'Well, you know, women stay in these relationship because of the financial benefit.' No, women do not stay in these relationships because of money. They stay in these relationships because of fear. I mean, a guy who can beat a woman senseless -- you better believe she's afraid of him. And the most dangerous time for a woman in a domestic violence relationship is actually when she leaves, not when she stays. 'How dare you leave me!' he says. That's because it's all about power and control, and now she wants to take her power and control back by leaving. That's going to make him really angry. So, no, she's not staying because of money. She's staying because of fear -- and she has a good reason to be frightened."
The Roller Coaster
"With women in abusive relationships, there's always a high-level of roller coaster ups and downs. After a big fight, there's the honeymoon period -- and that's always so wonderful. You know, 'I love you, I love you -- you're the best thing that's ever happened to me and I'm so sorry. I'll never do it again.' But soon enough, that moves to the tension-building phase, and then to the explosive phase. And that's when it all gets crazy again. And no matter what kind of abusive behavior happens -- whether it's verbal or emotional or physical or perhaps sexual -- it's always shocking for the woman."
Why Does She Keep Going Back?
"If you went out with a guy and he broke your arm on the first date, hopefully you wouldn't go back on a second date. But that's not how it goes in these relationships; there are a lot of good times before the bad times begin. So women do go back to abusive guys because of what I call 'nostalgia amnesia.' Think about it: if he was a 100 percent bad guy, no one would be with him. But she's probably hanging onto memories of things they did together. I worked at a domestic violence shelter for many years, and whenever these women came in, they were full of fire and brimstone -- upset, angry, devastated. But within a few days, they were into nostalgia. They had forgotten all the bad stuff and just remembered the good. So when they go back to the honeymoon phase, they think, 'Oh, that's the man I fell in love with; that's who he really is. So maybe if I do X and Y and Z, I can keep him like that all the time.' And in her mind, it becomes her responsibility. And if he doesn't keep acting nicely, she feels like she's failed."
Staying For the Kids
"A lot of women with kids stay with an abusive man because they feel their children need a daddy. Well, children need a healthy male role model. So you have to ask yourself -- and I say this to women all the time, and you can see them looking queasy -- 'If you had a 16- or 17-year-old daughter, and she started dating a man exactly like her father, would you feel like you did the best job that you could as a mother?' Or, 'If you had a son, and he ended up behaving exactly like his father -- exactly -- would you feel like you had done everything you could as a mother?' You can really see these women getting queasy. You can just watch the air being taken out of them. And there's a good reason for that: when children grow up in this type of environment, they're 25 times more likely to be an abuser or be abused.
So it's like you're taking out the best possible insurance that your children are going to be damaged. And don't think that your children don't know what's going on. I have counseled more than a thousand children in domestic violence relationships, and even when they're two years old, they absolutely know what's going on, every single one of them."

Investors closed the door on E2open   EOPN Thursday, sending shares down more than $4.10 to $11.51 after the software provider cut second-quarter and fiscal year guidance.
The 26% drop  made E2 Wall Street’s biggest loser.
E2 lowered full 2015 fiscal year revenue of $83 to $85.5 million, vs. prior guidance of $89 to $91.5 million.
“We have recently learned that three significant customers will not be renewing their contracts with E2open as a result of their having been acquired,” s ays CEO mark Woodward. “In addition, one other client is delaying the rollout of their E2open solutions into the next year. This unexpected reduction in our business has caused us to lower our revenue expectations for the balance of the year.”
The company, which provides cloud-based software to clients such as Diebold, DBD Avon Products   AVP and Qualcomm QCOM , also announced the resignation of Chief Sales Officer David  Packer.
Bank of America analyst Scott Shiao lowered his $21.50 price target to $18. Shares are off more than 61% since hitting an all-time high of $29.82 in February.

Ten Ways to be a Mythic Content WhispererEvery customer engagement with your brand starts with "smart" content.
It's more than great writing, although that's a given.
You need "cut through the clutter" images that jar the lethargic always on gaze of today's distracted consumer.
Ten Rules for Content Brands in Search of Crowds
Rule #1 - blog with the absolute best content you can produce, don't waste valuable time or resources on social media until your business has 30-50 blog posts completed.
Once this content is created you have something meaningful to share across the social web that's going to promote your business, not just garner momentary attention of today's fickle consumer.
To stand out: try irregularity with images juxtaposed with your content, irreverent or irresistible. Think Miles Davis kinda cool - the man knew when to add a note and when to hold back.
Your "readers" are on smartphones: attention span distracted and possibly distraught. You have about ten seconds to garner a visitor's attention with your content and images.
Rule #2 - break boredom's death grip like hold on your brand. Great content comes down to structure, story and presentation. A good editor is a great thing too.
Rule #3 - Jettison jargon when/where you find it. You know the stuff that makes your viewers' turn away and embrace the dark force, otherwise known as the click of death in marketing jargon speak.
Tips for jargon free content & related bon mots
Read everything David Ogilvy ever wrote.
Be plainspoken: Will Rogers knew what he was talking about.
Write different: well, I stole this phrase. But, all marketing is "creative plagiarism."
Put yourself in your customer's shoes when you write.
Tell a story when/where you can. That's easier said than done. Learn how GoPro tells a great story and builds brand.
As you write, have a real person in mind.
Behind every good writer is a stellar editor. Find one.
Try not to turn every blog post into a commercial for your brand.
Rule #4 - if building a global brand leave your local brand accent at home.
If you're a pizza shop in Brooklyn then go ahead and butcher the English language as you see fit. I love Brooklyn too and don't mean "Decker," although she's cool too.
Write for a global audience; it's not "miles" its kilometers BTW.
You may want to leave the metaphors at home or better yet, that's what a personal Twitter account is for.
Don't write in geekease - geeks think they rule the world but they don't, consumers do. Write accordingly.
Rule #5 - write with your ears
Social is really an endless feedback loop. See: Twiter. Be a content whisperer and pay attention to what's being said about your content.
Every blog should have comments working and someone should be paying attention and monitoring.
Ask and you shall receive. Throw up a blog or Tweet and ask others what they want to hear.
Great content is still about conversation. Build one around your brand.
#BTW Twitter lists put your "ears" on steroids. Use them.
Rule #6 - try to serve customers, tell a good story and be passionate
Ralph Lauren isn't selling clothes and BMW aren't selling cars. Admittedly, if your small biz selling linen supplies online you aren't going to be another Ralph Lauren. But, look for ways to be mythic with your customers.
Breaking Bad wasn't a story it was a human car wreck in slow motion over multiple seasons.
The world cup wasn't about football - it was a modern tale about risk and reward.
Apple rose from the ashes of failure by making great products with a good story, told by a master storyteller.
Rule #7 - be credible with your words when/if you can! Your writing has to stand on its own without endless facts and figures.
Some times boring facts and figures are just that: boring. Don't fall in love with data.
Credibility in spite of what marketers tell you is built up over times in many cases. See: NY Times or Der Spiegel.
Content flow helps to drive the reader onto the page.
Rule #8 - give em the good with the bad. We all get sick of content with no grounding in reality whatsoever: "How I Made a Billion Working Ten Minutes a Day"
Credible content, especially when targeting other businesses converts well when the "on page content" makes it clear you may not have all the answers.
"We turn clients into mythic brands; but, along the way,  you can expect some bumps and bruises." Makes for compelling content that draws the visitor in.
Medium (founded by Biz Stone) has made a name for itself as a publisher rapidly in a market crowed with many other publishing platforms. The content is open, truthful, honest and with a minimal number of images.
The minimalist design complements the content. But, that's another post.
Rule #8 - we are moving into a 2+2 world for smart content marketing.
Readers want to know how your products and services work and add value to their business.
Decisions are fraught with anxiety for many other biz execs who are weighing whether or not to use your services. So, tell them how you can help in measurable ways.
This is a Sales Force landing page below. Note the embedded facts and figures give you a sense for how they help businesses generate revenue using their products.
The content is lean and mean with a 2+2 component.
Rule #9 - embed calls to action in every piece of content that you write and share.
Many conversion experts like Neil Patel think embedding calls to action "above the fold" is a myth & these should be embedded in the copy after the visitor has read it!
Use bold and different colors for your Calls to Action vs. the Page's background color.
Use actionable copy conveying the value of the offer being made.
Don't oversell and under perform ("make billions working ten minutes a day").
Set expectations properly: "get our 30 page ebook on cooking skills with 20 recipes."
Embed calls to action ("CTAs") in all content: web, newsletter, social media and even your contact and "thank you" pages.
Rule #10 - there are no hard and fast rules to ensure success with your content. Share content, measure engagement and modify based on what content resonates with your visitors.
Make your content relevant to your market niche.
Add value by addressing questions your potential customers want to hear about.
Don't shout "buy, buy, buy" endlessly - there is a customer journey implicit with all good content, especially for B2B brands.
Embed some data; but, don't go overboard.
Make sure your content is aligned with your business objectives and ongoing marketing objectives
In our work with clients just creating content is only part of the equation. Promote your content (and brand) with paid ads, guest posts, comments and once you've published content like a blog, push it out to other targeted platforms.
Great content is a mythic beast embedded within your business DNA
It "lives" within each of you and in the DNA of your company. Dig deep and look for it.
Just remember, great content requires creativity and lots of trial and error, coupled with "listening" to your conversion metrics (newsletter sign ups, lead inquiries and/or revenue metrics).
Iterate your way to success: look for patterns of engagement using analytics and social engagement and adjust your content marketing initiatives accordingly.
Be patient, content marketing is a marathon, not a sprint.

Aussie  Aussie  Aussie! Life Lessons From the Land Down Underreddit
I just arrived in Auckland, New Zealand, after a few very pleasant days in Australia, which is just coming out of a pleasant winter and heading into an even more pleasant spring. Did I mention it's very pleasant there? Even though I've been spending most of my time giving speeches and meeting with potential partners for HuffPost Australia (with plans to launch in the Australian autumn, i.e. our U.S. spring), it's impossible not to remark on the vastness of the country. Australia ranks 6th in the world in size, but 56th in population. It's a continent and a country and an island. It's got vast empty stretches where you can feel very alone, and yet is also an extremely urban country, with nearly 90 percent of the population living in an urban center. As one mordantly funny bit of Australian wisdom warns tourists , "If you leave the urban areas, carry several litres of water with you at all times, or you will die."
It turns out, Australians are great at being part of the group (at least in my brief experience there, they don't need a lot of coaxing to come out and have fun), but also very comfortable with being alone. As technology and our increasing hyperconnectedness have created the phenomenon of being " alone together " -- in which we're seldom entirely and truly alone with ourselves, but also never really fully part of a group -- Australians still have a way of doing both.
But the country as a whole also puts into stark relief the challenges we all face. It's a country where the people are as sunny as the weather. They're upbeat, social, outgoing, gregarious, eager to connect and engage. And yet they're not immune to some of the same darker trends confronting other countries. For example:
• In 2013, 26 percent of Australians reported experiencing moderate or severe distress levels, and 73 percent said stress has an impact on their physical health. About 40 percent said they've used alcohol to help them cope with stress.
• Stress-related illness costs the Australian economy nearly $15 billion per year.
* One in five Australians will experience a mental illness in any given year.
• Depression is the number one non-fatal disability in Australia. In 2013, Australia was the second-highest prescriber of anti-depressants, with Australians' anti-depressant use doubling in the past 10 years.
• Suicide is the leading cause of death among people aged 15 to 24.
And Australians are facing the same work-life issues as the rest of the world. As one ad agency leader put it , "Clients don't think anything of texting me at 9pm at night. Now I don't feel as if I ever really switch off." So it's no surprise that, as a survey by Cisco found, nine out of ten Australians under the age of 30 are addicted to their smartphones, with 20 percent reportedly checking their devices at least every ten minutes.
And, of course, there's the challenge of getting enough sleep, which Australians are also not immune to. In one poll , 96 percent of those surveyed reported that they wake up tired, and almost 40 percent had dozed off in the middle of a meeting or right at their desk.
Australia may be geographically isolated from the rest of the world, but they're right in the middle with the rest of us in facing the roadblocks that keep us from living a healthy life. But though the roadblocks that make it harder to live a healthy life are pretty universal (overwork, exhaustion, burnout, stress, all amplified by technology), each country I've been in in my recent travels gets around the roadblocks in its own unique way.
In South Korea, for instance, which is often considered the burnout capital of the world, with the average worker putting in 2,200 hours each year , and the suicide rate tripling since 1992 (they even have a word, " gwarosa ," which means suicide related to overwork), they also have Kouksundo, a practice that mixes meditation, breathing and martial arts and has been shown to combat stress and anxiety.
And in Japan, another country that struggles with burnout and exhaustion, and has one of the highest suicide rates in the world, there are shrines and gardens and meditating monks everywhere, and ancient traditions of Buddhism, Shintoism and Zen Meditation are being adopted to help young people deal with the stress of finding a job.
In Australia, they have their own traditions -- from a vibrant beach culture to the ancient Aboriginal concept of " Dreamtime " -- the belief that "all life as it is today - Human, Animal, Bird and Fish is part of one vast unchanging network of relationships which can be traced to the great spirit ancestors of the Dreamtime." Traveling even a short distance outside an Australian city, into the quiet of the vast outback, or even pausing to absorb the unique beauty of the Sydney Opera House, the concept of Dreamtime can feel very present.
Of course, another key component of thriving is giving, and here, too, the Australians have made their mark. According to 2012's World Giving Index , Australians were the most generous people in the world, with more than two-thirds giving money to charity and over one-third giving their time to volunteer.
Australians have also made the " gap year " a milestone of young adulthood. Instead of going straight from high school into college and then straight into the rat race, more than a quarter of Australians put college off a year for a more unstructured time of exploration. ''Parents fear a gap year may disrupt a student's momentum," said Andrew Martin , a professor at the University of Sydney, "but it is possible it is part of the momentum."
It could be a different kind of momentum, more in line with one of my favorite aboriginal proverbs: "We are all visitors to this time, this place. We are just passing through. Our purpose here is to observe, to learn, to grow, to love... and then we return home."

Lone insurgent to survive attack on a coalition base is on Afghanistans death rowBy Dan Lamothe September 12 Follow @danlamothe
A Marine pays his final respects to Lt. Col. Christopher Raible, during a Sept. 19, 2012, memorial service at Camp Bastion, Afghanistan. Raible and Sgt. Bradley Atwell were killed after insurgents breached the wire at Camp Bastion on Sept. 14, 2012, launching an attack that destroyed numerous aircraft and damaged multiple buildings. (Photo by Sgt. Keonaona Paulo/ Marine Corps)
Two years ago Sunday, 15 insurgents crept onto one of the largest coalition military bases in Afghanistan, penetrating its external perimeter and launching a fierce attack with grenades, machine guns and other weapons. The toll was significant: Two Marines were killed, 17 other coalition members were wounded and nine aircraft were either destroyed or severely damaged.
Only one of the armed attackers involved in that Sept. 14, 2012, attack on Camp Bastion survived, military officials said. Mohammed Nazeer, now 24, was convicted and sentenced to death by an Afghan court, said Maj. John Caldwell, a Marine Corps spokesman at the Pentagon. But it still isn’t certain the punishment will stand. An Afghan appellate court affirmed the death penalty July 6, but the case is now before the Afghan Supreme Court for additional review, Caldwell said.
The uncertainty has frustrated the families of the two Marines killed, Lt. Col. Christopher Raible, 40, and Sgt. Bradley Atwell, 27, said Deborah Hatheway, Atwell’s aunt. U.S. military officials in Afghanistan contacted them last year asking for victim impact statements and family photographs to help make the case to the Afghan court that the insurgent should be punished severely for his actions, she said. The families were not informed there was an appellate process until this week, and are concerned it will function more leniently than the U.S. version.
“We’re grieving,” Hatheway said. “We lost a loved one, and we want answers and respect from the military.”
The surviving insurgent was wounded in a firefight with coalition forces on the base and captured. The results of a U.S. Central Command investigation released last October said Nazeer told investigators he was recruited to carry out an unknown “big mission” about four months before the attack by a Taliban commander.
Nazeer was in charge of a group of militants during the attack who planned to kill as many coalition members as possible while they were sleeping, he said during interrogation. He received training in Pakistan on weapons handling, communications and maneuvering as part of a military unit. He knew the other attackers came from Afghanistan or Pakistan, but did not know them before training for the mission, he said.
A day before the attack, the militants moved in civilian clothing across the border into Afghanistan in groups of two and met in Kandahar City, Nazeer told military investigators. They were transported by a truck to a safe house about an hour from Camp Bastion in Helmand province, and most likely prepared the attack in one of the small villages that had sprung up along the eastern side of the base.
It was no small target: Bastion is run by British forces, and was part of a 36-square mile compound that also included Camp Leatherneck, the major Marine Corps installation in Afghanistan, and Camp Shorabak, an Afghan training base. Bastion also serves as the home to a number of Marine Corps aviation units.

At about 10 p.m. Sept. 14, 2012, the insurgents breached the 30-foot high chain link fence at Camp Bastion and launched their attack. Wearing U.S. Army uniforms, they split into three teams of five men, beginning a battle that stretched for hours. Nazeer later told investigators that they worked from information that came from an unknown source or sources inside the military complex.
The first group of attackers planned to destroy the jets on the Bastion runway and their hangars, Nazeer said. The second group planned to target helicopters, while Nazeer’s group was to kill inhabitants in tents across the airfield, using both weapons and spray paint cans with cigarette lighters to start fires. The majority of the aircraft were destroyed with Soviet-made F1 hand grenades that were tossed or rolled underneath the planes, the investigation found.

Hundreds of service members on based scrambled by ground and helicopter to repel the attack, including Raible. The commander of a Harrier squadron, he was killed after midnight after launching a counterattack on a group insurgents . He was known as a methodical pilot who had become a squadron commander the first time he was reviewed for the position. He was reviewed for the Silver Star, a top valor award, Marine officials told this reporter for Marine Corps Times in 2012. He ultimately received the Bronze star with “V,” his family said. It’s another well regarded award that is one level lower.
Atwell also was killed early Sept. 15, 2012, by a rocket-propelled grenade blast on another part of the base, Marines on Camp Bastion said. He was a member of an aviation logistics squadron on base, and known by friends and family as a frequent jokester
.
The uncertainty about Nazeer’s punishment is the latest frustration for the families. Early last year, the families expressed anger that no leaders on base had been held accountable for lapses in security that allowed the attack. The top U.S. commander for the Middle East, Army Gen. Lloyd Austin, eventually launched an investigation to determine whether Marine Corps leadership on base was partly to blame at the request of Gen. James F. Amos, the Marine Corps commandant.
Two major generals, Charles “Mark” Gurganus and Gregg Sturdevant, were forced into retirement following the release of the results of an investigation last fall. Gurganus, the top U.S. commander in Helmand province, and Sturdevant, the senior Marine aviation officer in the region, “failed to exercise the level of judgement expected of commanders of their rank,” Amos said upon announcing the findings. The security plan for the Bastion-Leatherneck-Shorabak complex was “sub-optimal,” the investigation found.
Both generals said they were keenly aware of threats to Marines on smaller bases in Helmand, and also concerned about threats that contractors and Afghan troops on Leatherneck and Bastion would pose if they attacked coalition forces inside the base. A unit of insurgents attacking the base on foot from outside was lower on the list of perceived problems, however. Sturdevant also told investigators that the drawdown in U.S. troops across Afghanistan at the time had cut away a military police unit that controlled access to the Bastion airfield by manning a vehicle checkpoint.
Kim Raible, the fallen squadron commander’s mother, said she was disgusted to hear that Nazeer was turned over to Afghan authorities. She has asked many questions about the attack, but did not know about the appeals process until this week, she said.
“There’s never any answers,” she said. “To me, it’s just a total lack of regard for us and the Atwells and the loss that we have here.”
Caldwell, the Marine Corps spokesman, said in an e-mail that casualty assistance officers called the families Thursday with the latest news about Nazeer.
“As we approach the second anniversary of the attack on Camp Bastion, Afghanistan, we honor the memory of Lt. Col. Christopher Raible and Sgt. Bradley Atwell, as well as the service of those Marines who fought alongside them,” Caldwell said.

Did California make it illegal for businesses to stop dealing with customers who insult themBy Eugene Volokh September 12 Follow @volokhc
Did California also make it illegal for businesses to sue customers for libel, even when the customers’ claims are false? The new statute is billed as an attempt to block enforcement of “no-criticism” contracts, but it seems to go a good deal further.
Here’s the bill , signed earlier this week (emphasis added):
(a) (1) A contract or proposed contract for the sale or lease of consumer goods or services may not include a provision waiving the consumer’s right to make any statement regarding the seller or lessor or its employees or agents, or concerning the goods or services.
(2) It shall be unlawful to threaten or to seek to enforce a provision made unlawful under this section, or to otherwise penalize a consumer for making any statement protected under this section.
(b) Any waiver of the provisions of this section is contrary to public policy, and is void and unenforceable.
(c) Any person who violates this section shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) for the first violation, and five thousand dollars ($5,000) for the second and for each subsequent violation, to be assessed and collected in a civil action brought by the consumer, by the Attorney General, or by the district attorney or city attorney of the county or city in which the violation occurred. When collected, the civil penalty shall be payable, as appropriate, to the consumer or to the general fund of whichever governmental entity brought the action to assess the civil penalty.
(d) In addition, for a willful, intentional, or reckless violation of this section, a consumer or public prosecutor may recover a civil penalty not to exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000).
(e) The penalty provided by this section is not an exclusive remedy, and does not affect any other relief or remedy provided by law. This section shall not be construed to prohibit or limit a person or business that hosts online consumer reviews or comments from removing a statement that is otherwise lawful to remove.
The prohibition on enforcing (or threatening to enforce) a no-criticism/no-commentary contractual provision is relatively clear. (One could, I suppose, argue that a no-criticism provision isn’t “a provision waiving the consumer’s right to make any statement regarding the seller or lessor or its employees or agents, or concerning the goods or services,” since it only waives the right to make critical statements. But I suspect this will be read as covering provisions related to any statements in the sense of provisions that limit speech about the business or its goods or services to any degree.)
But what’s with the further provisions barring “otherwise penaliz[ing] a consumer”? Is it limited to, for instance, falsely reporting the consumer to a credit agency as someone who breached a contract (which would in any event likely be false and defamatory)? Or does it include refusing to do business with a consumer? Say your customer posts online something that insults you or your employees — even very seriously insults them, e.g., “I can’t stand dealing with this employer’s n—– receptionist” — and you decide to stop letting him come to your establishment. Are you “otherwise penaliz[ing] a consumer” “for making any statement” “regarding the seller or lessor or its employees or agents, or concerning the goods or services”? Would the consumer be able to get $2,500 from you for refusing to deal with him, and then $5,000 for each subsequent incident?
Or say that your customer has outright libeled you — said something that was factually false and defamatory, and perhaps even knew that his statement was false. (In many situations, negligent falsehood is enough under libel law as well.) You sue him for libel. Are you barred from doing so because you are “otherwise penaliz[ing the] consumer” for his statement? If suing him for a breach of contract is “penalizing” him, would suing him for a tort (even if the lawsuit is entirely justified under tort law) likewise be “penalizing” him? Note that the statute covers “any statement regarding the seller or lessor or its employees or agents, or concerning the goods or services,” not just true statements or statements of opinion.
To be sure, the legislature could impose laws banning discrimination against customers based on their past speech, and the legislature could create an absolute privilege for public comments about a business that would preclude any tort lawsuits. (There are similar absolute privileges for, for example, witnesses in judicial proceedings.) But I think these would be excessive limitations on the freedom to choose whom to do business with — a freedom that, to be sure, is already limited in other ways, but that remains valuable to the extent that it remains — and on the freedom to bring meritorious libel lawsuits. I doubt the legislature intended to do this here.
Still, the legislature clearly did intend some prohibition beyond just on the enforcement or threatened enforcement of the law — it expressly banned “otherwise penaliz[ing] a consumer for making any statement protected under this section.” Whatever exactly it intended, this is what it actually did. And while “otherwise penalize” isn’t expressly defined, the phrase is potentially quite broad. I sure hope there is a way of interpreting the statute narrowly, to avoid the results I describe; though I wish that the legislature were more careful in having crafted the law in the first place.
Many thanks to Prof. Mila Sohoni (University of San Diego Law School) for calling my attention to this aspect of the statute.

Where monetary policy isirrelevantRBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has a CPI inflation target for end-December 2014 at 8 per cent and end-December 2015 at 6 per cent.
Written by Surjit S Bhalla | Posted: September 13, 2014 1:10 am
The CPI data has just been released, and contrary to expectations, the annual rate of change (year-on-year) in the index was a very respectable 7.8 per cent. This is the fourth lowest monthly CPI number since February 2008, when a weighted average of rural and urban inflation rates registered 6 per cent. The lowest CPI inflation since then was in June of this year — 7.2 per cent. That is 78 months of data since February 2008, and two of the four lowest inflation months have occurred in the last three months.
The RBI has been fighting the good fight against inflation and many would be tempted to conclude that monetary policy is working towards reducing inflation and inflationary expectations. There have been three clear policy initiatives outlined by the RBI — the need to “anchor” inflationary expectations, the need to keep policy rates “high” and the need to implement “inflation targeting”. Perhaps all three measures have worked to reduce inflation — or, perhaps as documented here, none of these three “initiatives” has had any role in lowering inflation.
Tight monetary policy has as much to do with Indian inflation as it has to do with India’s magnificent loss to England in the recently concluded Test series. In a series of articles (academic and journalistic) written over the last decade, I have attempted to document that the traditional measures of monetary and fiscal policy — some version of money supply or credit growth or fiscal deficits — do not explain, at all, the path of inflation in India. Econometric models based on these variables, no matter how manipulated, explain zilch about Indian inflation.
Two variables are key to explaining Indian inflation. First, and obviously, international inflation plays an important role. However, the model that Indian inflation is some function of international inflation has broken down over the last decade. So what does explain Indian inflation, not only for the last 10 years but for the last 40? The policy of minimum support prices (MSP) for food determined by politicians at the Centre. MSP inflation explains a large fraction of the variance in CPI inflation around a 5 per cent mean.
The Indian inflation model is a one-variable, one-trick pony — CPI inflation is explained by MSP inflation of the previous year. The model simply says that the predicted inflation in any year is 5.1 per cent plus a third of the lagged MSP inflation. That is it. No repo rates, no real interest rates, no money supply growth, no fiscal deficits, nothing else. The model is estimated from 1978 (the policy of MSP came into being in 1975) continued…

Bypolls to 33 assembly  3 LS seats today; spotlight on UPBypolls for 33 assembly, 3 Lok Sabha seats today; spotlight on UP
Saubhadra Chatterji , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, September 12, 2014

The results of Saturday’s by-elections for three Lok Sabha and 33 assembly seats may not alter any ruling political equation in the states or the Centre, but they will be an indicator of the popularity of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and opposition parties ahead of four assembly elections likely by the end of the year.
They also pose a key question on the future of the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in Uttar Pradesh.
The BJP swept to power on the back of a so-called Modi wave this summer, but failed to maintain the momentum in last month’s by-elections in four states where it lost a majority of seats to the Congress party and its allies.
The BJP and its allies together won only eight of the 18 seats that went to the polls while the Congress and its allies won 10.
This time around, political pundits are looking to see which way the wind blows in the Saturday bypolls spread across Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Assam, Gujarat, Tripura, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Sikkim.
 
The results of two Lok Sabha seats — Vadodara which was vacated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Medak in Telangana — are unlikely to throw any surprises. But Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav’s prestige is at stake in his home turf Mainpuri, the third Lok Sabha seat.
Read: Irrespective of result, Mainpuri poised to script electoral history
 
In the last Lok Sabha polls, a large number of OBCs and Dalits rallied behind the BJP across the Hindi belt. The shift dented the SP and BSP’s support base in the largest electoral state. The SP won just seven seats while Mayawati’s BSP drew a blank.
 
The grand alliance of the RJD-JDU-Congress could halt the BJP’s charge into this caste base. In the absence of such an alliance in Uttar Pradesh, any further losses may lead to an existential crisis for the two caste-based parties.
 
If the opposition parties -- especially the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress in Rajasthan, Gujarat and Assam -- can stop the BJP’s march, their claim about the Modi wave waning will receive a further boost.

With elections in Maharashtra and Haryana due next month, any by-election victory will also give the beleaguered Congress a fresh face saver after its humiliating Lok Sabha defeat.
 
But it may not be so easy for the opposition. Of the 33 seats, 11 are in Uttar Pradesh where the BJP swept 71 of 80 Lok Sabha seats.
In Gujarat and Rajasthan, where 13 assembly seats are up for grabs, the opposition could not even open its account in the general election.
Three seats are heading for the polls in Congress-ruled Assam where the BJP bagged 50% of Lok Sabha constituencies.

In West Bengal, the ruling Trinamool Congress will be desperate to win both seats as it wants to show that the Saradha scam has not hurt the party’s prospects.
For the BJP, a win or even a number two position in the results from Assam and Bengal will further cement its position as a fast emerging force, replacing traditional opposition parties like AGP and Left, respectively.
The by-elections in Chhattisgarh, Sikkim, Andhra and Tripura will test if the ruling parties can further consolidate their positions. Tripura is the only state where the Left is in power.

2G: Kamal Nath says Manmohan might have erredComments
A day after former CAG Vinod Rai attacked Manmohan Singh on the 2G issue, ex-commerce minister Kamal Nath too questioned the former prime minister, saying he may have made a mistake in not acting despite his letter to him expressing concern over the spectrum allocation process.
“He may have made a mistake. I would go along with you. I brought it to his notice. He did not understand the import and he did not act,” he told a TV channel.
As Nath stepped up attack on the former PM, the Congress defended Singh. But Rai’s remarks gave fresh ammunition to BJP, which claimed the former CAG’s statement only confirmed what the party had been saying about dual power centre in the previous UPA government and the then PM’s failure to act.
“The 2G, CWG, Robert Vadra’s dubious land transactions, coal block allocation scam and Air India scam — all happened right under the nose of the then PM, but he did not act. The former CAG’s statement only confirms what the BJP had been saying all along,” information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar said.
The senior BJP leader said that the former PM and the Congress leadership can not shirk their responsibility and need to answer some serious questions raised by the former CAG.
Javadekar said Rai’s claims about tapping of his phone and pressure built on him not to name the former PM in his reports were very serious allegations.
Congress sought to turn the tables on Rai and asked why he did not file an FIR if some pressure was brought upon him not to name Singh in the two scandals. Alleging political motive, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said these are nothing but “rejected allegations primarily made by Subramanian Swamy”.

Going back toRawalpindiWhy has the army found it convenient to use Khan and Qadri against Sharif?
Written by Christophe Jaffrelot | Posted: September 13, 2014 1:35 am
The Pakistan army finally decided to step into the country’s ongoing crisis last week, after a fortnight of agitation and seven rounds of fruitless negotiation between Nawaz Sharif and the Imran Khan-Tahirul Qadri combine, which wanted nothing short of the prime minister’s resignation. On August 31, the chief of army staff, Raheel Sharif, chaired a corps commanders’ conference, which concluded with a short but revealing communique: “While reaffirming support to democracy, the conference reviewed with serious concern the existing political crisis and the violent turn it has taken, resulting in large-scale injuries and loss of lives. Further use of force will only aggravate the problem. Army remains committed to playing its part in ensuring security of the state and will never fall short of meeting national aspirations.”
The army seemed to be projecting itself as referee and the only institution that cared about the national interest, rising above the disputes between power-hungry politicians. The irony is that the crisis had been made possible, if not provoked, by the army itself.
First, according to Federal Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid, Imran Khan was being advised by the influential former chief of the ISI, Ahmed Shuja Pasha. Second, in an August 20 meeting at Rawalpindi, the Pakistan Ex-Servicemen Association, headed by Vice Admiral (retd) Ahmed Tasnim, called for the dissolution of assemblies and fresh elections. Third, it would seem that the supporters of Imran Khan and Qadri were able to reach the heart of Islamabad, and even break into the high-security Red Zone, because the army let them. The army appeared to remain a passive observer, in spite of the government having asked it to guarantee the security of Islamabad. Five companies had been deployed to secure the main offices of the judiciary, the Parliament House, the Presidency, the Prime Minister’s House, as well as the foreign missions and offices. Yet protesters laid siege to the PM’s House and stormed the headquarters of PTV. The next day, they broke through the gates of the Secretariat, the head office of the administration. The police alone reacted, which resulted in three deaths.
Finally, Imran Khan and Qadri were in communication with the army. On August 29, both met the COAS, and Imran Khan announced that Raheel Sharif had been appointed mediator by the PM. On September 1, PTI president Javed Hashmi revealed that Imran Khan had told the party’s core committee that the movement “can’t move forward without the army”. Of course, Imran Khan asked the disgruntled Hashmi to leave the PTI.
Why has the army found it convenient to use Khan and Qadri against Sharif? Because the prime minister resisted its “tutelary beliefs” — to use a phrase from Aqil Shah’s remarkable book, The Army and Democracy: Military Politics in Pakistan — even as it grew more assertive. After Nawaz continued…

Its not just about 100daysIt is impossible to tell how close India is to the ‘tipping point’, but it would seem the Modi government has adopted a callous approach in hurriedly undoing the green checks imposed after prolonged consideration and debate.

Our past experience in policy implementation underscores the problems inherent in assessing governments on the utilitarian principle, which is precisely what most observers have invoked to judge the performance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his first 100 days in power. As has been the case in the past, they have tried to estimate the number of people to whom benefits could accrue from the initiatives of the Modi government or, alternatively, predict their influence on economic growth.
Since the efficacy of any policy depends immensely on its execution and the socio-cultural context in which it operates, what appears imperative in theory can often turn disastrous in reality. Despite the pretensions of those who believe the effects of socio-economic programmes can be predicted with the precision of science, their impact, salutary or not, unfolds only in the future, thus unknowable in the present.
This suggests it might be advisable to substitute the utilitarian principle with an arguably more ethical one to judge governments. What could that ethical principle be? Modern politics revolves around the idea of enhancing the quality of life or ensuring it doesn’t deteriorate. Therefore, it won’t be wrong to assert that governance leading to death and devastation is not only ethically wrong but should also be outside the pale of politics.
Yet, the inscrutability of the future implies we cannot know which of the policies, conceived with the utmost noble intentions today, might wreak havoc tomorrow, demanding corrective measures or even reversal. Indeed, our inability to foresee the future with any precision yields the ethical principle for judging governments, namely, they should not commit to policies whose consequences are irreversible. This is because, should it be realised that the consequences of any policy are inimical to society, their very irreversibility renders the damage permanent.
It is against this benchmark of irreversibility that the Modi government, as also its predecessors, must be judged in the absence of accurate foreknowledge. Undeniably, the verdict is emphatically in favour of the Modi government on issues such as its insistence on bureaucrats attending office punctually, phasing out archaic laws, focus on sanitation, and the Jan Dhan Yojana facilitating financial inclusion. Regardless of their execution, these will not engender irreversible consequences.
By contrast, the government is guilty of triggering irreversible consequences through its environment policies and silence over its party cadres intent on tearing apart the country’s social fabric. Is this assertion justified, given the opaqueness of the future? Yes, just as medical science tells us that a Stage III cancer patient continued…

U.S. retail sales increase broadly in AugustU.S. retail sales increase broadly in August
Business News: Retail sales up in August
KCRA 3 financial expert Kelly Brothers has the latest business news including retails up in August.
KCRA 3 financial expert Kelly Brothers has the latest business news including retails up in August.
Economic Indicator Economy Consumer Confidence
U.S. retail sales rose broadly in August, which should ease some concerns about consumer spending and support expectations for sturdy growth in the third quarter.
The Commerce Department said on Friday retail sales increased 0.6 percent last month as Americans bought automobiles and a range of other goods after an upwardly revised 0.3 percent gain in July.
Read the story
“It still paints the consumers muddling along. The general message on the economy is that it's improving but we still have a lot of slack to take up,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.
The increase in retail sales, which account for a third of consumer spending, was in line with economists' expectations. July's retail sales were previously reported to have been flat.
So-called core sales, which strip out automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, and correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product, increased 0.4 percent in August.
8
The dollar gained modestly against the yen and euro, and U.S. Treasuries' prices extended losses after the data. U.S. stock futures were pointing to a slightly weaker open.
August's increase in core retail sales followed an upwardly revised 0.4 percent gain in July, which was previously reported as a 0.1 percent rise.
Core retail sales were up 4.1 percent in the 12 months through August, well below their pre-recession growth pace of about 5.5 percent.
Strong gains in consumer confidence are yet to translate into robust sales growth.
“There might be some pressure from the lack of real wage growth,” Brown said.
0
Retail sales are lagging other relatively bullish economic data such as manufacturing, housing and employment, raising concerns growth this quarter could fall below the anticipated 3 percent annual rate.
August's fairly solid retail sales report and upward revisions to July's figures should ease some of those fears. The economy grew at a 4.2 percent pace in the second quarter.
In August, receipts at auto dealerships jumped 1.5 percent after advancing 0.6 percent the prior month. While sales at service stations fell 0.8 percent, that reflected declining gasoline prices, which should free up income and support discretionary spending in the months ahead.
Sales at clothing retailers gained 0.3 percent and receipts at sporting goods shops increased 0.9 percent.
Sales at electronics and appliance stores rose 0.7 percent, while receipts at building materials and garden equipment suppliers rebounded 1.4 percent. Sales at non-store retailers, which include online sales, edged up 0.1 percent.
A separate report from the Labor Department showed import prices recorded their biggest drop in nine months in August as a sharp decline in the cost of petroleum products eclipsed rising food prices, keeping imported inflation pressures subdued.
Import prices fell 0.9 percent last month after slipping 0.3 percent in July. In the 12 months through August, prices dropped 0.4 percent.

(Bharti Airtel today…)
NEW DELHI: Telecom major Bharti Airtel today announced the launch of its 3G service in African country Tchad following recent award of licence for high speed internet services by the Tchadian government.
The company announced the launch at an event which was attended by Tchadian President Idriss Deby, the Mauritanian Head of State, Mohamed Ould Abdelaziz and Goodluck Jonathan , the President of the Republic of Nigeria, Airtel said in a statement released here.
"The launch of the 3G network in the country goes in line with the Government commitment to Chadians to make the country become a technology hub in Africa. The private sector contributes a lot to the access of internet and we wish Airtel success with its new 3G network project," Tchadian President Idriss Deby said.
With this launch, Tchad has become 16th 3G market of Airtel in Africa. The company operates in 17 African countries.
The company is left with Nigeria where it has to launch its 3G service.
"With a licence already granted in Niger, services will also be launched within the fiscal year," the statement said.
"Our 3G platform will allow our customers to combine the enormous potential of the internet with the convenience of cellular phones and other mobile devices," Airtel Tchad, Managing Director Salia Gbane said.
According to data from McKinsey & Co, there are currently about 400 million mobile subscribers in Africa.

Scotland  Sovereignty and Corporationsreddit
Since 1945 the number of nations has soared from about 60 to more than 180.  The first wave of new sovereign states came with the decolonization movement of the 1960s and 1970s; the second in the early 1990s with the break-up of the Soviet Union.  If Scotland votes for independence it may ignite a third wave.  Dozens of would-be nations are waiting in the wings:  Wales, Catalonia, Flanders, Breton, the list is long.
In 1957 in his classic book The Breakdown of Nations economist and political scientist Leopold Kohr persuasively and rigorously argued that small nations are the natural order having been throughout history the engines for enlightenment, innovation, mutual aid and the arts.  The large nation state, he argued is not a reflection of improved efficiency but of superior force.
"It is the great powers which lack the real basis of existence and are without autochthonous, self-sustaining sources of strength. It is they that are the artificial structures, holding together a medley of more or less unwilling little tribes. There is no Great British' nation in Great Britain. What we find are the English, Scots, Irish, Cornish, Welsh, and the islanders of Man. In Italy, we find the Lombards, Tyroleans, Venetians, Sicilians, or Romans. In Germany we find Bavarians, Saxons, Hessians, Rhinelanders, or Brandenburgers. And in France, we find Normans, Catalans, Alsatians, Basques, or Burgundians. These little nations came into existence by themselves, while the great powers had to be created by force and a series of bloodily unifying wars. Not a single component part joined them voluntarily. They all had to be forced into them, and could be retained by them only by means of their division into counties, Gaue, or departments. . . ."
With a population of 5.2 million, a sovereign Scotland would rank just below the median size of the world's nations.  It could rest assured that nations of its size can thrive.  Think Finland, Costa Rica, Ireland, Norway.  Small nations are easier to administer, more nimble in policy and their governments are more accountable to and reflective of their communities. Indeed, it is the divergence between the values of the Scottish culture and those of the Conservative government in Whitehall that has been a major impetus for independence.   That divergence is reflected in the fact that today only one Tory holds a seat from Scotland in the British Parliament.
Prime Minister Cameron's Conservatives advocate welfare cuts, austerity and privatization.  They enthusiastically embrace what the Scots would call the mean values of the Conservatives heroine Maggie Thatcher who summed up her thinking with the famous phrase,  "There is no such thing as society."
The Scots most definitely believe there is a thing called society. The Scottish National Party, which controls the Scottish government and supports independence, wants to get rid of nuclear weapons, raise the minimum wage in line with inflation and begin a sweeping extension of child care. It is also more favorable toward immigration and the European Union than the British government.
"There is more of a communitarian viewpoint in Scotland that sees the value of coming together to provide public services, to acknowledge the strength of community in Scotland," Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's deputy first minister told the New York Times.
But if Scotland does become sovereign it will quickly discover that that sovereignty has been severely restricted by new global rules promoted by increasingly dominant global corporations.   Nations may be getting smaller, but corporations are getting larger. Of the 100 largest economies in the world, more than half are global corporations. The Top 200 corporations' combined sales represent over one quarter of the world's GDP.
The brute strength of corporations is usually sufficient to cow small countries.  To control larger nations, corporations have convinced/bribed/bludgeoned governments to put in place rules that severely circumscribe their authority to express the will of their people.  Today corporations can with impunity buy a post office box in the Bahamas and pay no taxes in the United States, or Scotland.  Trade agreements grant extraordinary new rights and privileges to foreign corporations and investors that formally give corporate rights precedence over the right of governments to govern their own affairs. If there is a dispute, foreign corporations can skirt domestic courts and directly challenge any policy or action of a sovereign government in often secret proceedings presided over not by judges, but by arbitrators, often corporate lawyers themselves.  Dozens of corporate challenges are currently wending their way through these "courts".
•US tobacco giant Philip Morris is suing Uruguay and Australia over their anti-smoking laws.
•US company Lone Pine Resources Inc. is demanding $250 million in compensation from Canada because of lost potential profits from Quebec's moratorium on "fracking".
• The Swedish energy giant Vatterfall has sued Germany for its decision to phase out nuclear power, demanding billions in compensation.
In 2010, in an unusual display of concern, 37 academics from developed and developing countries, including eminent writers in the field of investment law, issued a joint public statement decrying the way trade agreements hamper 'the ability of governments to act for their people'.  They maintain, "States have a fundamental right to regulate on behalf of the public welfare and this right must not be subordinated to the interests of investors where the right to regulate is exercised in good faith and for a legitimate purpose." No one listened.
Perhaps after it gains political sovereignty and attends to its internal affairs, Scotland could engage the global rules that prevent governments from expressing the will of their citizens.  As historian Arthur Herman has noted in his book How the Scots Invented the World: The True Story of How Western Europe's Poorest Nation Created Our World & Everything in It, Scotland has once before had an outsized impact on the world.  In the 18th century Scotland's appreciation for democracy and its strong emphasis on universal literacy made Edinburgh and Glasgow epicenters of intellectual thought. All of us are aware of one of Scotland's most famous sons, Adam Smith.  But very few of us are aware that before he wrote The Wealth of Nations he wrote the 1759 best seller. A Theory of Moral Sentiments .  Building on the ideas of Francis Hutcheson, one of the founders of the Scottish Enlightenment, Smith argued that sympathy and empathy could be the twin foundations of a just economy.
From the first lines of the book Smith is clear about where his theory will take him, "How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it."
Later Smith adds:
"This disposition to admire, and almost to worship, the rich and the powerful, and to despise, or, at least, to neglect persons of poor and mean condition, though necessary both to establish and to maintain the distinction of ranks and the order of society, is, at the same time, the great and most universal cause of the corruption of our moral sentiments. ...We frequently see the respectful attentions of the world more strongly directed towards the rich and the great, than towards the wise and the virtuous. We see frequently the vices and follies of the powerful much less despised than the poverty and weakness of the innocent."
As authors Fred Kiel and Doug Lennick explain , Adam Smith believed "we are all born with a 'moral sense' - that is, he believed humans are innately equipped with consciences. Because of this assumption, he thought that the 'invisible hand' of economic self-interest would be governed by the people's moral sense. Economic self-interest, yes, but in the context of what's good for all."
Perhaps Scotland's independence can usher in a new Scottish Enlightenment, one that again makes morality and sympathy a foundation for designing national and global economies.   Is it too much to ask a tiny nation to again re-invent the modern world?

The Only Advice You Need to Get Anything Donereddit
I've been living by a motto recently, and it has not only helped my productivity, but my overall health as well.
You see, I'm a creative trying to make it in the market, which means I suffer from loads of self-doubt, thoughts of inadequacy, and a paralyzing fear from time to time. This can often lead me to cuddle up in my Snuggie and turn on Netflix.
Yet, there is a problem in doing this. When I choose to not act on my problems, I'm nowhere closer to solving them. Instead of hammering out my work, I choose to waste time feeling bad about it.
When I realized this, I came up with a motto to fight all these feelings that stop me from getting things done. I pump myself up with this motto every time I feel stuck.
It's simply this:
DO THE WORK.
It sounds easy, but it's really not.
When you try to do work you know you need to do, work that you might not even enjoy, all sorts of feelings and thoughts come up that try to stall you from your work. Here are some of those feelings:
Fear
Fear will keep you from trying. You can't ultimately get rid of fear, but you can learn not to obey it or give it so much power.
Anxiety
When you have a large task to do, anxiety will want you to dwell on it in your thoughts, stall you until you're in an emotional state where you can't function. Doing the work, not dwelling on it, conquers anxiety.
Laziness
Surfing YouTube isn't the best use of your time. Laziness will want you to be distracted, but time is too valuable for that.
Apathy
If you're not passionate about what you need to do, chances are you won't want to do it. Yet, if it's something you need to do, not doing it won't get you any closer to being free from it.
Discouragement
There are many things that can discourage you from doing work. But discouragement, like fear, only depends on the power you give it. You can either choose to listen to the discouragement, or do the work to get over it.
If something needs to get done, it doesn't help to feel these emotions. These emotions will often try to trick you away from the necessary work. What does help, however, is actually doing the work.
But once again, this is still a hard task when these feelings can have a powerful voice. How do you get the encouragement to do the work and combat these feelings?
Easy. You focus on what you can change about your work.
If you place a sober and logical eye on your work, you'll find that there are only three things you can change about it: how you approach it, how it gets done, and when it gets done.
How You Approach It
Work is not a bad thing. Many of the greatest accomplishments in the world have been achieved through hard work and perseverance.
Yet, we still drag our feet when we leave for our jobs. We still sigh about returning to work in the morning. We still count the hours till the weekend.
Many people have a bad mindset towards work, as if we're conditioned to never like it. But truth is, we can't change the reality of work. The more we complain about it doesn't make it go away. What we can change is how we approach it.
Henry Ward Beecher once said this:
"Work is not the curse, but drudgery is."
We often treat work like it's the enemy, but the true enemy keeping us from work is how we approach it.
How it Gets Done
There are two choices that come with doing your work: to do it poorly or greatly. This is always in your control. But when it comes to doing your work, you have to also consider what will make you most proud of that work when you're finished.
When you complete a work, you want to feel proud or accomplished about it. That means you must do your work well.
Replace the paralyzing emotions you feel about doing work with something healthy, like the feeling of success and doing more.
When it Gets Done
Reality is, the more you prolong your work, the more uneasy you're going to feel about it. Not doing it isn't going to solve anything. Doing it and doing it soon is the only way to relieve yourself.
You have the choice to either do your work now and feel better sooner or do your work later and feel bad about it longer. Do the work now and you won't regret it later.
Doing the work is the only thing that'll get you closer to where you need to be. Try to center yourself on that as much you can.
Put this motto on a sticky note and hang it above your desk. Write a note and put it on your fridge. Write it in your schedule. Just do whatever it takes to remind yourself: the only way to get done your work is to simply do the work.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were falling on Monday, dragged down by the tech sector as investors make space in their portfolios for Alibaba's planned debut later this week and biotech shares weighed further on the Nasdaq.
Alibaba's could be the largest initial public offer in history and has seen "overwhelming" interest, meaning Yahoo's 23 percent stake could be worth more next week than it is now. Yahoo stock was up 1.7 percent with 1.9 million shares already traded.

CAABS Drive Workplace Bullyingreddit
Workplace bullying is any unwanted attention, attacks, suggestions, retaliation, humiliation, belittling, condescending behavior, or anything else that makes an individual feel unwanted, threatened, demeaned, insulted, or less than their worth.
Individuals who report workplace bullying incidents - at times - receive negative feedback from others (e.g., peers, managers, etc.) who can offer assistance or protection, such as: "You need to toughen up" or "You need to develop thicker-skin".  These types of responses aren't acceptable for anyone who reports harassment and requests assistance.
On-going harassment and abuse can cause even the toughest individuals to question their self-worth.  The bottom-line is that nobody should be caused to think or feel less about themselves due to another's attacks: verbal, physical, or psychological.
Drivers of workplace bullying are often related to:
Culture - an organization's beliefs about the way its policies, procedures, or standards will be implemented, administered, and enforced;
Attitude - individual or organizational beliefs about the way an incident should be addressed or thoughts and feelings about something that occurs within an environment;
Atmosphere - permitted behavioral standards within an organization;
Behavior - individual, organizational, or societal actions or activities;
Situation - an event that occurs at a specific moment.
If workplace bullying drivers aren't properly managed, then workplace bullying can easily become rampant.  Therefore, any workplace bullying incident(s) should be addressed, reported, and resolved quickly.  If not, an organization risks workplace bullying incidents becoming a part of its acceptable and permissible behavioral standards (e.g. customs, norms, or standards) if nobody identifies, addresses, or reports these incidents.  As a result, these attributes become part of an organization's culture.
These points are significant as individuals frequently learn through observation and will often use others behaviors as reference points to validate positive or negative behavior.
Anyone can be an advocate for change through communication to workplace bullies that their actions or behaviors aren't acceptable, aren't wanted, won't be tolerated, and will also be reported.  Furthermore, bullying incidents should be documented to create a written record; otherwise, unreported incidents cannot establish a potential pattern of behavior.  These types of responses create an active defense against unacceptable, disrespectful, and demeaning behavior.
It only takes a single individual to communicate to a bully that 'this isn't acceptable behavior' to begin a process of change, which will also serve notice to other workplace bullies that this type of behavior won't be tolerated.
Everyone has a responsibility to collectively work together to prevent workplace bullying to ensure that bullies don't win and targets don't unnecessarily have to deal with abuse or suffer alone.
Additional information on workplace bullying can be obtained in Mr. Young's solution-oriented book " Bullies...They're In Your Office, Too: Could you be one? " or his mini-book " Management Spotlight: Workplace Bullying ".

India to have 4 more strategic oil reserves:...Andhra Pradesh
(The strategic oil reserves…)
BHUBANESWAR: Union minister of state for petroleum and natural gas Dharmendra Pradhan on Friday said he hopes to make his home state of Odisha the “energy gateway” in eastern India as he announced a series of projects that he said will bring in Rs 1 lakh crore in investments and employ 50,000 people.
The projects include linking of IOCL’s refinery to a proposed petroleum and petrochemical park in Odisha and oil and gas pipelines from ports in the state to Ranchi and Surat.
Pradhan, who met Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik and his team in Bhubaneswar along with senior members of his ministry, said at a conference later in the day that Odisha is among the few states which will have gas from three sources – imported LNG, domestic natural gas and coal bed methane (CBM).
IOCL’s 15 mt refinery, entailing a Rs 34,000 crore investment, near port town of Paradip is nearing completion and will be commissioned by February 15, kicking in an 11-year tax deferment agreement that will cost the state Rs 3,000 crore in earnings annually.
It was also agreed at the meeting that GAIL and IOCL will tie up with Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation for a city gas distribution.
Odisha hopes to attract investment of Rs 2.74 lakh crore at a proposed petroleum, chemicals and petrochemicals investment region which is to be located at Kendrapara and Jagatsinghpur.
A 700 kta polypropylene plant, which will be completed by 2017 at a cost of Rs 3,150 crore, will provide feedstock for further downstream industries. The central ministry also reiterated plans for setting up of two LNG terminals, a 5mt IOCL terminal at Adani’s Dhamra Port and a 4.8 mtpa GAIL terminal at Paradip Port. IOCL chairman B Ashok and GAIL chairman BC Tripathi were also present on the occasion, along with other officials of the ministry.
Pradhan, who hails from Deogarh near the industrial belt of Talcher-Angul-Keonjhar, had announced three pipelines earlier this month. These include an oil pipeline from Paradip through Raipur to Ranchi at a cost of Rs 1,793 crore, a Rs 913 crore LPG pipeline from Paradip through Haldia to Durgapur, two gas pipelines costing Rs 5,000 crore from Surat to Paradip, and Ranchi to Paradip, and stretching the Haldia-Barauni pipeline up to Paradip.

The Family I Didn t Expect to Find.Written by Shannon Heath , Sr. Communications Specialist for SAS
What does it take to be on the Huffington Post's B-team ? Led by Arianna Huffington, this not-for-profit initiative is a group of global business leaders committed to making businesses more socially responsible -- and blogging about it.
It takes a real commitment to corporate culture , and not just the inspirational poster kind of commitment. It takes a real dedication to work/life balance, along with a real understanding from management that this difference can improve business and a real understanding from all employees that this difference can improve their lives.
What's exactly is that difference? Let me tell you a story....
Earlier this year, my family experienced an unexpected tragedy. The kind of tragedy which knocks you out of yourself and turns your whole world upside down. A tragedy which also caused me to be out of work for three months. It was completely unforeseen; we had absolutely no warning. For someone with a self-professed, unapologetic Type A personality, not only did this cause me inexplicable emotional paralysis, it left me panicked for the void I would leave at work -- the unfinished projects, the unmet deadlines, the unattended meetings. I had no time to put together an out of office plan. I had no time to outline current projects or pass them off appropriately to someone who could keep them on track in my absence. I was just plucked right out of work and into a dark hole.
I've worked at previous companies where this kind of tragedy would have been handled cordially and professionally; I would have been given the legally-required allotment of leave. However, at the end of that term, I would have been required to hit the reset button and get right back into the swing of things without missing a beat, assuming that my position hadn't been filled by someone else.
But at SAS , my team stepped in and filled in with no questions or hesitations.  My work was not left undone. My internal and external clients were patient when there was a learning curve with those picking up the pieces of projects unrelated to them. My management checked on me daily. My immediate colleagues, and even those with whom I only work tangentially, checked on my family constantly -- and supplied us with daily meals that lasted for more than three straight months (and we still have food in the freezer!) -- much of which was prepared right here in our SAS campus cafes. Beyond that, our Work/Life department provided library books, online resources and on-going counseling services (all free!) to help us cope.
My manager, my entire team and Human Resources worked with me on a transition plan to help me acclimate back into my work environment -- at my own pace. Facilities even altered my workspace over a weekend to better suit my personal needs before I even came back to work.  The transition back to work was comfortable and comforting. My family felt the benefits of this comfort, as well.
You see, SAS creates family. The emphasis on employee well-being and work/life balance makes family possible. No matter where you are on your career path, SAS makes family possible. The flexible work environment enables most employees to create a schedule that best suits their personal needs -- whether it's attending a school play or taking an aging parent to the doctor. The counselors in the work/life department are a wealth of knowledge and resources for college planning, depression, anger management, eldercare and grief. But, as you can see, it doesn't stop there. Most employees can attest that SAS is family.  We rely on each other. We help each other succeed. We celebrate team successes. We hang out after work. Our kids play together. We feed each other. We grieve together.
Sure, we have a lot of convenience benefits at SAS . I don't want to spell all of those out -- you've probably heard all about them before . And I do appreciate a variety of those offerings every day. But, what really makes a difference to me are the elements of SAS culture that the outside world doesn't always see: The balance.  The camaraderie. The management support. The family it allows me to have -- off campus and on.
This impacts me greatly; and, subsequently it impacts my work. Life happens -- and in some cases, it's impossible to bring your best self to work, no matter how hard you try. Your mind, your heart are somewhere else -- and at SAS, that's where they should be in those situations.   And once you've taken care of whatever that situation is, you're more focused and able to fully function at your desk. Our executives have often said that employees are the driving force behind SAS' consistent revenue growth, profitability and expanding technology.
When you can love what you do, love who you do it with and still maintain a balance in your personal life, you have work utopia. And when employees feel that way about where they work, it shows in their work. Happy employees = happy customers. It's a virtuous cycle.
It sounds simple, right? Yet, so many employers just don't get it.
At SAS, our executives and management genuinely understand that culture directly impacts our customers, and our business; but, they also genuinely understand that culture impacts people. And our people are awesome.
I'm so excited for others to see the side of SAS that I see every day.

Call the police because your husband is beating you  lose millions of dollarsBy Eugene Volokh September 12 Follow @volokhc
FILE – In this May 23, 2014, file photo, Janay Rice, left, looks on as her husband, Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice, speaks to the media during a news conference in Owings Mills, Md. A law enforcement official says he sent a video of Ray Rice punching his then-fiancee to an NFL executive three months ago, while league officers have insisted they didn’t see the violent images until this week. The person played The Associated Press a 12-second voicemail from an NFL office number on April 9 confirming the video arrived. A female voice expresses thanks and says: “You’re right. It’s terrible.” (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File)
Sixteen female Senators have called on the NFL to impose a “zero tolerance” policy for domestic violence by players. “If you violently assault a woman, you shouldn’t get a second chance to play football in the NFL.”
I sympathize with the sentiment behind the letter, and — if I were a football fan — I would find it hard to feel any connection as a fan with a player who I knew was guilty of violent assault; it might make good business sense for the NFL to fire such players.
But where would it put football players’ wives who are being beaten? If they call the police, and the player is prosecuted, that doesn’t just mean the end of the player’s career; it likely means a loss of millions of dollars to the wife as well as to the husband. They call the police, and their husband is out of a job, they can’t pay their mortgage, and they and their children are potentially headed for poverty.
And of course the women may still love their abusive husbands, and be willing to expose them to a well-deserved prosecution and even public shame, yet not to the loss of the career that their husbands care deeply about. But even if they understandably no longer care about their husband’s happiness, and plan to get a divorce after calling the police, the husband’s job loss would mean that he’s unable to pay child support, keep them and the children in the family home, and so on.
Of course, some women may choose that financial loss over continued abuse, and I respect them for it. But some women may not be willing to make that trade-off, and they thus won’t call the police. Indeed, they won’t tell anyone, for fear that it will leak out.
They may be especially unwilling to say anything when the abuse starts, and doesn’t yet seem to be chronic or extreme. By the time they do call the police (if they ever do), the abuse would have had to be something unendurably bad for them, bad enough to lead them to be willing to ruin their own financial lives as well as their husband’s. And that might be too late; indeed, as best I can tell, it’s better if women try to get police intervention early in the process of abuse rather than later. But will they do that if this early intervention is so costly for them?
Indeed, my understanding is that this is already one reason why some wives don’t report abuse by their husbands: If the husband is arrested and imprisoned, he’ll lose his job, and when that happens the family loses, too. But a zero-tolerance policy, under which the employer obligates itself to permanently fire the husband, and in a situation where the loss of income has such a dramatic financial effect, would only exacerbate the problem. This is an aspect of what I call the anticooperative effect of law : Sometimes measures to fight crime actually cause people to fear cooperating with law enforcement.
Now maybe on balance a zero-tolerance policy would still do more good than harm. The senators’ letter argues, for instance, that the policy would “send a strong message that the league will not tolerate violence against women by its players, who are role models for children across America.” If that’s right, then maybe (1) the deterrent effects plus (2) the norm-setting effects (the message sent to children across America) will on balance protect women more than the anticooperative effects will jeopardize them.
But on the other hand, the anticooperative effect will, at least in some measure, decrease the deterrent effect. “What’s she going to do,” a football player might think to himself, “call the police and lose all the income that she’s gotten used to?” And sometimes that player might be correct in this prediction. If you think this is so, and if you’re skeptical that children are going to be much influenced by this policy — or would be better influenced by hearing more frequent stories of significant criminal and professional penalties under a less punitive policy than by hearing of the zero-tolerance policy and its likely very rare enforcement — you might think that women will be more hurt than helped by exposing NFL wives to the prospect of financial ruin for calling the police.

Assertions an effort to promote his book:CongressPrint
Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: September 13, 2014 2:12 am
The Congress Friday hit back at former Comptroller and Auditor General Vinod Rai virtually accusing him of spinning a yarn for the BJP after he alleged that former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh chose to look the other way even after being cautioned in the 2G and coal block allocations.
Congress also asked why he is silent on the serious strictures passed by the CAG in Gujarat against the state government headed then by Narendra Modi.
Hitting out at Rai, the Congress alleged that his public assertions are nothing but an effort to promote his forthcoming book. “The disease of book promotion, attendant marketing and publicity is assuming the proportions of an epidemic. It seems that we need a new antibiotic for this viral,” Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said. He said Rai has already spoken through the reports of the CAG office many times, but his hunger for publicity it seems was not sufficiently satiated.
Singhvi said “similar” and “identical allegations” were hurled by BJP leader Subramaniam Swamy in his applications to courts, but were rejected by the Supreme Court and the special CBI court.
The Congress also argued that Rai’s “denials” about joining politics have been “ambiguous” and “his words suggest that he is keeping all his options open.”

BJP asks ex-PM to react to RaisremarksPrint
Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: September 13, 2014 2:10 am
The BJP demanded that former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the Congress respond to former CAG Vinod Rai’s remarks on the role of the  former Prime Minister in the 2G and coal block allocations as they are “serious.”
“The information given by the former CAG is very serious. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh did not have power in his hands, this is true. Power was with 10 Janpath. And that is why the picture that has emerged today is correct,” Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar said during a special press conference.
“It is the responsibility of the (then) Prime Minister that so many back to back corruption cases happen and you say that I don’t know anything, this can’t be. So it is serious,” Javadekar said.
Former CAG Vinod Rai, who is writing a book on his days as head of Comptroller and Auditor General of India, criticised Manmohan in an interview.
Rai said he felt he felt Manmohan Singh was part of the decisions to allocate 2G telecom spectrum on first-cum-first serve basis and coal blocks without auction.
Javadekar said Manmohan Singh also owed an explanation on the Commonwealth Games scam and the poor state of the national air carrier, Air India.
“The UPA government had earlier decided (late Congress leader) Sunil Dutt would be the chairman of the organising committee. But it was changed and Suresh Kalmadi was appointed. Manmohan Singh cannot shirk away his responsibilities,” the Information and Broadcasting Minister said.

Manmohan was overpowered by compulsions of coalitionpoliticsPrint
The book by Rai itself is divided into specific case studies of the scams which unfolded during the Manmohan Singh years, with Rai squarely blaming the former prime minister for the sense of drift and official apathy as he witnessed it.
Written by Ritu Sarin | Posted: September 13, 2014 2:08 am | Updated: September 13, 2014 11:10 am
The latest in what can be described as a series of “brickbat books” is former Comptroller and Auditor General Vinod Rai’s account of the years he spent as the country’s chief auditor under the UPA rule. The book itself is divided into specific case studies of the scams which unfolded during the Manmohan Singh years, with Rai squarely blaming the former prime minister for the sense of drift and official apathy as he witnessed it. A few days before the book’s official launch, Rai spoke to RITU SARIN about the core issued raised by him. Excerpts:
One of your motivations in writing this clearly was defending the CAG against the attack on it for being partisan and delivering a blow to the economy…
No, that was not the motivation, else I would have written it immediately after retirement. Neither did I want to create any sensation. What I thought was important is that the younger generation of auditors who were getting demoralised must know what actually transpired. Officers  and bureaucrats must function transparently and in case of any wrong-going, speak up fearlessly. My account, I hope, will help them doing that.
Your attack on the former Prime Minister is quite direct. Now the Congress is calling your account politically-motivated. Did you expect this?
If I wanted political mileage, I would have done this four months ago before the elections. I purposely did not want to make it sensational. As far as the Prime Minister is concerned, what I have said is that all the information and papers did reach his desk. In the 2G case and the coal allocation matter, the Telecom Minister and the Coal Minister, respectively, kept him informed. Then how can he say he wanted transparency?
What precisely do you fault the former Prime Minister for?
For taking a distanced view of subjects like spectrum and coal allocation which is a matter which needs deliberation. Whether it was conduct of the Commonwealth Games or the coal allocation process, it is important for a leader to speak out. He should have guided the decision-making process in a certain direction but he did not. He was completely overpowered by the compulsions of coalition politics.
All through the book and in the annexure you have made use of official correspondence and also used personal accounts, for example, of conversations with the Prime Minister, to buttress your arguments. Is this expected?
In fact no confidential documents have been used. All the documents were used in our reports or obtained by people via RTI. And there are many personal conversations which I did not desire to put in the public domain.
For instance, you have mentioned one conversation with him when he speaks to you on being cautious continued…

In Chicago  Hoops Tournament Helps Heal  Provides Hopereddit
Almost three years ago, I joined Father Michael Pfleger of St. Sabina Church on his weekly community walk on the South Side of Chicago. Father Pfleger is a long-time family friend and activist in the Chicago community. He and my mother bonded years earlier in their fight for the poor and the disenfranchised in society. When I joined the walk that hot summer evening, Chicago was being projected as the murder capital of America. As we walked the streets, young men and women were coming from everywhere to greet us. Some joined us on the walk and others just watched and waved. As we continued to talk to the young men and some of the community leaders, I posed this question: If Father Pfleger and I brought you together for a game of basketball promoting peace would you show up? The immediate response was yes.
The question was the seedling of an idea. Our goal was ambitious. We wanted to give the young men a chance to get to know each other on and off the court. If we could bring them together, along with the community, around a game of basketball, we could break down some of the territorial barriers that have been created by simply not knowing your neighbor.
Shortly thereafter, the PEACE game/league was developed. Father Pfleger and St. Sabina Church on Chicago's South Side hosted the tournament. It gave us an opportunity to bring young people together in a safe environment for play and sharing knowledge. From my personal experience and belief, it is very difficult to hurt someone you play with daily. When we played together we were able to free ourselves from the historical weight and heaviness of the labels that had been ascribed to us because we were poor. Now with eyes our wide open we were able to see each other as brothers, neighbors and friends. We saw a person to play with, not run from.
At the first PEACE game, Chicago Bulls stars Joakim Noah, Derrick Rose and Taj Gibson coached the teams. NBA officials and Chicago natives Danny Crawford, James Capers Jr. and Marc Davis officiated the games. NBA current and former players Sonny Parker and his son Jabari Parker, Bobby Simmons, Quentin Richardson, Will Bynum and Jannero Pargo attended, as well as J'Marcus Webb of the Bears. Noah's foundation, Noah's Arc, along with companies like Connor Sports saw the potential and promise of bringing communities together and have remained partners in this endeavor. They have shown an impressive commitment through the work they continue to do with this game/league and with communities around the country. Joakim's foundation has become a steady pillar in the community. He continues to work with the youth in Chicago year round.
His foundation is focused in two areas: arts and sports. Through the programs they offer they help kids recognize their full and positive potential in life. The commitment and love he continues to show to our kids should be applauded. Connors Sports has and continues to be a good corporate citizen. They have taken a lead role in helping Father Pfleger organize the yearly PEACE tournaments. Through their participation and steadfastness, other corporate partners have begun to participate.
On September 20, we will host the third Annual PEACE Game at St. Sabina Church. The game/league has expanded throughout the past three years and, in addition to basketball, Father Pfleger and St. Sabina Church now offer life skills classes, mentoring, GED classes, employment training, and internship opportunities with corporations. The success stories are immeasurable. Many are working, some are getting their GEDs and others are getting the training and life skills they need to secure good jobs. Most importantly, the crime rate has gone down in this area. These young people now know they have a place to go to develop life skills and life lessons.
Seeing the young men from the PEACE game/league and the kids that I work with through the Windy City Hoops program with Mayor Rahm Emanuel, I remain inspired and encouraged by their resilience. I remember walking the same sidewalks when I was young, just like the young men we see today. I remember nothing came easy.
I remember my mother's zeal to protect us and all the children in the neighborhood. In an era where blame is abundant, and solutions are rare, I am reminded of the many mentors and community leaders who provided a refuge for me and my brothers and sisters.
I am grateful that I had mentors like Sonny Parker and Danny Crawford. I met both of them when I was 12 years old. None of us knew at that time we would all make it to the NBA. Danny Crawford and Sonny Parker were older, but they always took the time to share their wisdom and knowledge about life. They were never too busy to check on me. They always wanted to know how I was doing and they never failed to ask about my mom.
When Sonny made it to the NBA we were all so proud of him. I remember when he came home for the summer, he played in the annual summer league held at the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boys and Girls Club on Chicago's west side. We were so excited to see "P Funk," which was Sonny's nickname in the neighborhood. After he scored 46 points and lit up the opponent I was waiting for him outside to get a autograph. P Funk not only gave me a autograph, he gave me his gym shoes, too. Then he asked about my mom. Now I have come full circle. When I see Sonny's son Jabari, the newest NBA sensation drafted by the Milwaukee Bucks from Chicago, I ask the same question, his dad asked me: "Jabari, how are you doing ... Are your mom and dad OK?"
I have experienced and seen the impact of sports and the healing power of play. Both can positively affect the energy and interests of young men and women. However, sports alone should not be the answer. We must provide our youth with a holistic educational and recreational experience. Growing up, my mother and father reinforced the role of education in our lives. They believed education was the pathway to success.
Chicago makes headlines these days because of the violence infecting our city. Still, beyond the headlines, the majority of communities throughout the country are filled with loving and caring families of young men and women who have dreams of becoming president or CEOs of their own start-up business. They dream of becoming doctors, lawyers, teachers, nurses or policemen who actually serve and protect.
Things will not get fixed overnight in Chicago. But it is heartening to see the impact that athletes can have working with community leaders. It is even more moving to see young men and women take a stand against the violence in their communities and work toward a better future.
Ultimately, it is our responsibility and duty to insure that our youth are healthy, safe and educated. So become a mentor, get involved in your community. Join us in Chicago on Saturday, September 20 at St. Sabina Church for the 3rd annual Peace game/league. I am excited about the season and even more excited about the future of our kids.

Does Audi TT keep the magicWith the new A3, Audi thinks big
These cars were stunning design successes, even if the underlying Volkswagen Golf-derived hardware was less than virtuosic.
In 2006, a new generation of TT flipped the equation, delivering dramatically improved performance in a package that skewed, uninspiringly, towards the mainstream of contemporary coupe design.
For the 2015 model year in global markets and 2016 for the US, a third-generation TT arrives aiming to recapture the spark of the original edition. While the new car is the same length as the second-gen car it replaces, its wheelbase has been extended so that front and rear overhangs return to the ultra-short stretches that characterised the ur-TT.
Other model cues remain, such as the racing gas filler-inspired fuel door and the semi-circular wheel arches. Inside, a battleship turret trio of gun-barrel vents aims out of the centre of the dash. Available quilt-patterned tan leather upholstery evokes the first-generation’s baseball glove-inspired leather, albeit without the thick, catcher’s mitt-worthy trim stitching.
Today, the TT serves as something of a blank canvas for Audi, as the brand has shown three wildly divergent concept cars – a racing car, a shooting brake, an off-roader – based on the TT at motor shows in recent years, and Hackenberg promises yet another will appear at the 2014 Paris motor show, in October.
For its part, the production TT is also available in sportier TTS trim, and a racy TTRS is in the works. “This is a car you will be able to steer with the accelerator,” in the fashion of rear-drive sports cars, Hackenberg pledged when speaking of the RS.
It is a statement you can believe, given Hackenberg’s own racing CV and the astonishing dynamics of the third-gen car, as experienced on the mountain roads of Spain’s Costa del Sol and Ascari circuit racetrack.
The author drives the TTS at Ascari:
The new TT, like earlier models, is built on the workaday foundation of the Volkswagen Golf. But modern techniques permit amazing latitude even within a shared platform. So while the Golf is an all-steel, front-engine, front-drive economy car, the TT is an aluminium-steel, front-engine, all-wheel-drive (though front-drive is available ex-North America) sports coupe.
Sophisticated computer-controlled hydraulic clutches route power to the wheels where it is needed, while the computer can also squeeze individual brakes to help the TT turn in, and electromagnetically adjustable dampers precisely control suspension movement. With the onboard supercomputer calculating trajectories in real time, the TT’s moves are faultless, whether the car is strafing passes in Montes de Málaga or shredding Ascari’s apexes. The car’s steering is as perfectly weighted and accurate as a sniper rifle, letting the driver pick the target and then get the TT to its destination through some combination of steering input and computer wizardry.
Audi is mounting a credible challenge to Honda’s supremacy in teasing gorgeous tones from four-cylinder engines, with the standard 2-litre turbo providing a stirring – if appropriately muted for a premium luxury coupe – soundtrack. The thrum, mind, is pleasantly shattered by the rifle crack of the exhaust on full-throttle upshifts.
This engine comes in two different output levels, 230 horsepower for the regular TT and 310hp for the TTS. North American market specs have not been finalised, but official ratings will be the same as those for the A3 sedan , allowing for possible variations due to intake and exhaust differences between the cars, explained product spokesman Mark Dahncke.
Global-market cars also will have a six-speed manual transmission and a 184hp 2-litre diesel four-cylinder engine available.
But engines aren’t what made the TT famous; sheetmetal is. The first TT’s Bauhaus-inspired bulges and sweeps can be rightfully credited with lifting the esteem and sales that Audi has commanded ever since. The outgoing generation, though – as much better a car as it was – has never been a design statement.
Audi insists it reclaims that heritage with this new TT, but frankly, it doesn’t. Without a second-generation car alongside for comparison, shoppers will be hard-pressed to identify changes. In a product line with two contemporary coupes, the A5 and the TT, the third-gen car raises the unwelcome question of whether there is enough room for both.
The TT makes an emphatic statement, however, once you open the door. Audi pushes new frontiers in the integration of electronic gadgetry and information for car cockpits. The solutions presented in the new TT elegantly – and simply – point the way to the future.
Whereas some cars now suffer the blight of not one, but two display screens in the middle of their dashboards (looking at you, Infiniti Q50 ), the TT does away with a central screen entirely.
All navigational, informational and instrumental information is routed through the Audi Virtual Cockpit to this display. It is a screen that replaces the traditional instrument cluster ahead of the driver, clearing the dashboard of glowing LCD clutter.
And Audi’s industrial designers did not sully their good work with a profusion of buttons. Instead, climate control functions are now integrated into the control knobs set into the ventilation ducts. Seat heater and cooler controls are similarly integrated into the outboard vents.
It is a masterful cleansing of the dashboard, one that will surely work its way through the rest of Audi’s line and be copied by imitators as quickly as possible. “We will also use it in other vehicles with a more family-car character,” Hackenberg allowed.
There is an irresistible irony here. Having been accused of merely scaling a few exterior designs up or down to suit different segments, it seems only natural that Audi would turn so deeply inward. This may be the third-gen TT’s most indelible statement, one that  could reach farther than even that iconic first TT ever did.

Says lesbians, gays & bisexuals cannot be included
Hardly five months after the Supreme Court, in a far-reaching judgment, directed the government to grant legal recognition to transgenders as a ‘third gender,’ the Centre has raised several objections against the verdict.
The judgment, delivered on April 15, had given transgenders the right to decide their own gender. A Bench comprising Justice K.S. Radhakrishnan and Justice A.K. Sikri directed the government to treat them as “socially and educationally backward classes of citizens.”
The Ministry of Social Justice has sought a clarification from the court on the verdict. It said there was ambiguity in the ruling, as lesbians, gays and bisexuals (LGB) could not “obviously” be included in the transgender category. The concept of LGB was based on the “sexual orientation” of a person, while the term “transgender” had to do with “a person’s own deep sense of gender identity.” This stand contradicted the Supreme Court, which said “transgender” was used in a wider sense in the present age. “Even gays, lesbians and bisexuals are included by the descriptor ‘transgender.’ This has come to be known as an umbrella term,” Justice Radhakrishnan, who wrote the judgment, had held.
The Ministry also found fault with the court’s inclusion of “eunuchs” in the transgender category. It said the Oxford Dictionary meaning of “eunuch” was “a castrated man employed to guard women’s living areas at an oriental court.”
“Eunuchs are not transgenders, nor a variant of transgender. It is a different concept altogether,” the Ministry said.
The Ministry asked the court if it expected the government to suo motu include all transgenders in the Other Backward Classes (OBC). There was an established procedure under the National Commission for Backward Classes Act, 1993 for this.

What if LS debates Scotland  asks UK MP in House of Commons discussion on J-KComments
A heated debate in the House of Commons on Thursday on Jammu and Kashmir saw several British MPs uphold India’s position, with one MP questioning whether it was right for the house to hold such a debate, citing a hypothetical situation of the Lok Sabha debating Scotland.
 
Barry Gardiner, Labour MP from Brent North – a constituency with a large minority of people of Indian origin – said: “In exactly a week’s time, the people of Scotland will go to the polls in a referendum to decide the future of our country”.
 
“The debate has been hotly contested and not without its ill temper; but imagine the outrage on both sides of that debate if the Indian Parliament, the Lok Sabha, were today debating the merits or demerits of Scottish independence and passing judgement upon what we in the United Kingdom see as a matter for us, and us alone, to decide,” he said.
 
Conservative MP Bob Blackman called for Pakistan security forces to vacate Pak-Occupied Kashmir, while others highlighted the plight of Kashmiri Pandits driven out of their homeland, and the incidents of terrorism and infiltration emanating from across the border.
 
Blackman said: “Far from wanting secession, either to Pakistan or as a separate state, the vast majority of people in the state (Jammu & Kashmir) want it to remain part of India. I have a solution to the problem, which is that the Pakistani forces illegally occupying part of Kashmir should leave and unite Jammu and Kashmir as one state under the auspices of India, and then it should be decided what is to happen”.
 
The debate saw the British government reiterate its known position that “It is not for the UK to prescribe a solution or to mediate in finding one”.
 
Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood said he agreed with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent statement that any meaningful dialogue between India and Pakistan ‘necessarily requires an environment that is free from terrorism and violence’.
 
Ellwood said: “The long-standing position of the UK is that it is for India and Pakistan to find a lasting resolution to the situation in Kashmir, one which takes into account…the wishes of the Kashmiri people”.
 
This was the second debate on Jammu & Kashmir in the House of Commons in three years.
 
Unlike the debate in September 2011, which evoked much concern in official Indian circles, this time the response was less evocative, which partly reflected a globally more confident India’s reset world-view that focusses more on countries such as Russia, Japan and the United States.
 
To suggestions by some MPs that Britain had a role to play in Jammu & Kashmir, Conservative MP Gregory Barker said: “Given Britain’s legacy in India, I have to say that I find the assumption—presumption, rather—that we somehow have a role to play slightly offensive”.
 
He added: “It smacks of neo-imperialism, it is arrogant and we should respect the extraordinary achievements of India since 1947. Britain would have a role to play only if and when our advice or assistance were sought. Clearly, in this case, it is not”.
 
Of ther 18 MPs who participated in the debate, two were of Indian origin: Paul Uppal (Conservative) and Virendra Sharma (Labour). The debate was secured by David Ward, Liberal Democrats MP from Bradford East, a constituency with a large minority of Pakistan origin.

Kashmir floods: Come  hell  or rain  army won t stop until last man is rescuedComments
From helicopter sorties to building bridges to tugging makeshift boats through muddied waters.  Our jawans have done it all  over the last one week to save tens of thousands marooned by the floods in Jammu and Kashmir. 
The jawans from the Indian Army, the Air Force and the National Disaster Relief Force braved hostile conditions to pull out 1.3 lakh survivors so far, while the state administration took a backseat. There are nearly four lakh more trapped by the waters in different areas, and the task is still by no means over.
We take a look at some amazing pictures of the daring rescue operations.

Penguin India rolls out new cover for Roald Dahl s Charlie and the Chocolate FactoryCharlie and the Chocolate Factory turns 50, gets a yummy new cover
Avantika Mehta , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, September 12, 2014

After the new covers for ‘Charlie and the Chocolate Factory’ launched by its parent company Pengiun UK were dismissed by twitterati as ‘creepy’, the firm's Indian branch has bounced back with its own cover art for new editions of Roald Dahl’s beloved children novel.
The launch is just in time to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the book's publication in 1964, and also the author’s birthday on September 13.
The classic, which has sold over 13 million copies worldwide, will be available in a new avatar — designed by Sir Quentin Blake, who famously illustrated several of the original covers for Dahl’s books.
Blake was also the winner of the international Hans Christian Andersen Award in 2002, the highest recognition available to creators of children's books.
"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is all about imagination, travel and making your dreams come true and we are delighted to celebrate the 50th anniversary of this beloved classic in this very special way,” commented Hemali Sodhi, Publisher, Penguin Random House India, Children’s.
In a cover, styled to resemble a partially unwrapped bar of chocolate, the new edition makes for a delectable sight.
Apart from launching a new edition of the book, Penguin India has also announced, in conjunction with Amazon India, a contest available to children between the ages of nine to 12.
Contestants who correctly answer five questions related to the book on the Amazon.in website will be flown to the UK to see the Roald Dahl museum.
Is this all too much for a book which is half a century old? Amazon India director Samir Kumar doesn’t think so.
"Roald Dahl is one of the most read and cherished authors of children's fiction. Even today his interesting works fascinate children just like 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' that continues to be one of the most popular children's book on our website," he says.
Dahl, regarded as one of the most successful and well known of all children's writers, was born in 1916 in Wales of Norwegian parents. Educated in England, Dahl started work for the Shell Oil Company in Africa.
He began writing after a "monumental bash on the head," sustained as an RAF pilot during World War II. He died in 1990 at the age of seventy-four.
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory continue to be one of his most popular books. It has inspired several adaptations — including a 2005 film directed by Tim Burton, and a long-running Broadway show in the UK.

Sania Mirza does a U-turn  decides to play in Asian Gamesprint
In a significant development, Sania Mirza has agreed to play in the upcoming Asian Games, two days after AITA announced that they would allow top players to miss the Incheon event, keeping in mind their requirements on the professional circuit.
Sania's decision means that the Hyderabadi has put on line 900 ranking points, which she had to defend on the tour during the period of the Asian Games, to be held from September 20-30.
Sania will miss the Wuhan WTA event which has 900 points on offer. She, though, will play in Tokyo, where she is defending champion but now points in that tournament have been reduced to 475 from 900.
"I was feeling weird, I was not feeling happy with my decision, so I thought I will play. I know I am sacrificing 900 points, but sometimes you have to take a decision," Sania told PTI before leaving for Tokyo.
After the Games, Sania will compete in China Open, starting September 29.
Sania and Cara Black are fourth in the Race to Singapore, the year-end championship but the Indian hoped that she will be able to earn enough points in Tokyo and Beijing to remain in top-8.
Asked if there was any pressure on her, the US Open mixed doubles champion replied in a negative.
"No there was nothing like that. I hope we come back with a medal, I know the chances are less in both mixed and women's doubles but I will give my best shot," the 27-year-old said.
Asked if Indian team's participation was in jeopardy in the wake of mass pull outs of top players and that forced them to convince Sania to play, AITA President Anil Khanna said there was no pressure on them from the government.
"I can only say that government did not say anything to us. Yes, she is playing. It?s a good news," Khanna said.
Leander Paes, Rohan Bopanna and Somdev Devvarman have all been allowed by AITA to play on the professional circuit instead of the Asian Games to defend points in the next few weeks.
"This is my bread and butter and at the end of the day my ranking has dropped to 35 in the world. Hence I have to get some job security for next year. I have to play a long fall season, through Kuala Lumpur as well as Tokyo, these two tournaments are the exact dates in the nine-day span of the events in Asian Games," Paes had said while speaking to media ahead of the Davis Cup tie against Serbia.

Outraged Miami Residents Confront Walmart Developer in KendallLongtime Miami investigative reporter and nearby resident Al Sunshine blisters Walmart developers with questions, Leslye Jacobs who started a 9,000 person signature petition against Walmart sitting bottom right
*********************************************************************************
Walmart is looking to fill a gap in their chain's lockdown coverage of southwest Miami by building a SuperCenter into one of only three endangered pine rocklands habitats in all of Florida , as part of Coral Reef Commons.
Ever since the Miami Herald issued a stunning report this past July announcing that a Walmart anchored, mixed use development had been approved in south Miami-Dade County, residents have been scratching their heads how such a plan could've moved through the county process without attracting attention.
The "Little House" itself is a product of a land use fight.
Last night was my first visit to the Kendall Civic Center Pavillion aka the Little House. It's run by the Kendall Federation of Homeowners Associations .
About 80 very upset residents and a dozen Walmart developers touting their plans to manage endangered species peacefully shared the room for over 3 hours of presentations, and questions, but no definitive answers.
The Tropical Audubon Society's sent a representative, Matt Schwartz  of the South Florida Wildlands Association drove down from Orlando to attend, and longtime homeowner on the block, the legendary investigative reporter Al Sunshine was in the Little House.
KFHA's outstanding president Michael Rosenberg impartially ran the proceedings.  Rosenberg failed to exactly enforce five minute limits on speakers, but succeeded tremendously in revealing the contour of what promises to be another multi-year "Citizens versus Walmart battle".
At the meeting, Pete Cummings wisely faced the assembled crowd with the poise and thick skin of a veteran real estate developer with his unwise "Manage Nature and Build Walmart" plan.
Ram Realty of Palm Beach County, led by Mr. Cummings, purchased the property from the University of Miami, raising the ire of local residents.  University of Miami in turn had acquired the environmentally sensitive property for free from the Federal Government, decades before and created a south campus and the C-stars installation.
The Coral Reef Commons project raises a great many concerns, but two stand out in particular.
Firstly, can we trust a real estate developer and Walmart to protect fragile ecology, while raising land use intensity to maximum levels?
Cummings started the meeting bragging about his track record of conservation, based on building in Martin County, which I can neither confirm nor deny. He said that we should trust him, because of that track record. His firm, Ram Realty would manage Nature itself along with Walmart.
Under direct questioning, freely and without a subpoena at the meeting, Mr. Cummings admitted that his firm did not conduct the highest level of due diligence before concluding the $22,000,000 purchase with a loan from Wells Fargo Bank.
I've been a licensed mortgage brokerage business owner since 2005. In my experience every commercial transaction requires the "Phase 1" screening that Ram Realty employed which determines up to 100 years of land use with photos & public records along with an environmental engineer's conclusion.
The "Phase 1" environmental study that Ram received - according to Mr. Cummings last night in direct response to my question at the podium - DID inform him of at least some endangered species - however, the developer candidly admitted that his firm failed to recognize the need for secondary environmental screening or interpret the listed species in that report as endangered.
The "Phase 2" environmental study is a $25,000 and up report that may include testing soil samples, hiring of ecological experts and extensive research into existing land use of the entire property.  Ram passed up on this pricey survey for a cheaper boundary survey, which merely measures the size of the property and fixes its outer limits.
Intentionally or not, Ram Realty disregarded some pretty important red flags that careful inspection would've turned up.
If they're not even good stewards of their own capital, why should Miami-Dade residents trust Ram Realty at all?
Secondly, is it wise to build a high intensity, 24 hour land use into an ecology that requires periodic "prescribed burns" ?
Yes. Walmart's so desperate to get a cheap deal - one that comes at the expense of retaining the very last remaining shred of natural Florida in this city - that they plan to locate near periodic uncontrolled forest fires every few years.
Yes. Miami-Dade publishes a primer on pine rocklands called: Born of Fire. The spanish language version rings better on the tongue: Nacidas del Fuego!   (note: author added the exclamation)
ZooMiami sent a staffer with an outstanding presentation on pine rocklands - explaining that there are 7 main risk factors to managing these lands and Fire Suppression is at the top of that list.
Yes. While Anti-Walmart activists probably dream of burning down unwanted Walmart stores - as if life was South Park - any properly prescribed land management plan will include possibly setting Walmart on fire in the process.
Do you want to live next door to Walmart and have a forest fire next door every 3 to 7 years?
Sadly, this Walmart developer seems to view commercial contracts as somehow unbreakable, while our fragile ecosystem is something he can manage.

Shipments of larger Apple iPhones delayed by a month amid record ordersApple iPhone
(Reuters) - Apple Inc said it received a record four million first-day pre-orders of its new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, meaning many customers will have to wait until October for their new phones.
Apple said a significant number of orders will be delivered to customers beginning Friday, but many will be shipped in October as demand outstrips supply.
The first-day pre-orders for the new iPhones, which feature larger screens, were double the two million orders for iPhone 5 models in 2012.

"We attribute this (pre-order numbers) to the large pent-up demand for larger screens on the iPhone ...," Janney Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note.
The brokerage raised its unit sales estimate for the latest iPhones to 37.4 million for the fourth quarter and 60 million for the first quarter.
While Apple did not break out first-day pre-orders for iPhone 5Ss and 5Cs launched last year, it sold 9 million of those phones in the first three days in stores as China joined the list of launch countries for the first time.

John Yoos defense of the legality of Obamas military campaign against ISISBy Ilya Somin September 12
President Obama’s decision to wage an air campaign against ISIS without getting any new congressional authorization has drawn severe criticism from legal scholars across the political spectrum . But Obama does have a prominent defender in John Yoo , a legal scholar well-known for his defense of very broad executive power, especially during his time in the Bush administration. Although I think Yoo’s arguments here are wrong, he does deserve credit for consistency. He advocates the same extremely broad view of executive authority today as he did under the Bush administration, even though he’s clearly no fan of Obama’s.
Yoo’s main argument is the theory that the president, as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, has the authority to initiate war with or without congressional authorization, at least if he thinks it is necessary to protect national security. This argument is flawed for reasons I summarized here :
Article I of the Constitution unequivocally gives Congress, not the president, the “power . . . to declare War.” The Founding Fathers sought to avoid a situation where one man had the power to commit the nation to war by himself. Even Alexander Hamilton — the biggest supporter of sweeping presidential power among the framers of the Constitution — recognized that “the Legislature have a right to make war” and that “it is . . . the duty of the Executive to preserve Peace till war is declared…”
In some of his other writings, Yoo has argued that Congress’ power to “declare” war only includes the right to announce that a legal state of war exists, which is distinct from the power to actually initiate fighting. But as legal scholar Michael Ramsey explains , the original meaning of “declare” includes initiation of conflict, not just a legal declaration of its existence.
Yoo further contends that even if Obama does need congressional authorization, he already has it under the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force. But, as I and many others have noted , the 2001 AUMF only covers groups that perpetrated or abetted the 9/11 attacks, and cannot be used to justify attacking a group that did not even exist in 2001 and is today actually an enemy of al Qaeda. Yoo claims that the 2001 AUMF authorizes preemptive and preventive attacks against any terrorist group that might threaten the United States, because it states that “The President has authority under the Constitution to take action to deter and prevent acts of international terrorism against the United States.” But if that passage really gave the president blanket authority to wage war against “international terrorism,” there would have been no need for the more specific authorization to “use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized,
committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons.” It is a longstanding principle of legal reasoning that we should not interpret laws in such a way as to render large parts of them completely superfluous. It is also worth noting that the passage quoted by Yoo is from the preamble of the AUMF, not the operative part. Preambles are not usually considered legally binding.
Yoo suggests that the use of force against ISIS is authorized by the 2002 Iraq AUMF , which gave President Bush the authority to initiate the Iraq War in 2003. This argument overlooks the fact that the 2002 AUMF is limited to the use of force against “the continuing threat” posed by Iraq. For reasons I outlined here , this is best interpreted as limited to the threat posed by the regime of Saddam Hussein and its allies. As Yoo notes, the 2002 AUMF give the president the authority to enforce relevant UN Security Council resolutions on Iraq. But the resolutions in question (summarized in this 2004 article by Yoo ), all target the Iraqi government, not insurgent and terrorist groups.
Michael Ramsey offers a stronger version of the claim that the 2002 AUMF authorizes Obama’s actions. He notes that ISIS is in many ways a successor organization to some of the Sunni insurgents that US forces battled in Iraq in 2007-08. If the 2002 AUMF covers the fighting between US forces and ISIS’ predecessors back then, why not also Obama’s actions today? The answer, I think, is that the 2007-08 fighting was legally authorized not by the 2002 AUMF but because US forces had actually been attacked by the Sunni insurgents. US troops don’t need congressional authorization to defend themselves. But the US combat role in that conflict ended when American troops were withdrawn in 2011. President Obama himself has repeatedly said so . Therefore, today’s intervention against ISIS cannot be justified as a continuation of the fighting against Sunni insurgents several years ago. It is a new war and requires new congressional authorization.

Brent crude slips below $97 a barrel; may help govt bridge twindeficitsPrint
Global crude price reduction and domestic diesel price hike have led to a decline in combined daily under-recovery of oil marketing companies. (Reuters)
Written by Sandeep Singh , Surabhi | New Delhi | Posted: September 13, 2014 2:25 am | Updated: September 13, 2014 10:33 am
Brent crude, hovering around $113 per barrel in June, fell sharply and on Friday and was trading at $97-level following healthy supply, dip in consumption growth in key markets such as China and also a cut in global demand forecast by the International Energy Agency.
The price dip is crucial for India, which would show up positively on four fronts: exchange rate, inflation, current account and fiscal deficits, and investor sentiment.
Global crude price reduction and domestic diesel price hike have led to a decline in combined daily under-recovery of oil marketing companies from Rs 230 crore for fortnight ended August 31 to Rs 195 crore for the fortnight effective September 1.
“Every $1 decline in crude prices brings down the current account deficit by about $1bn. The nearly $10 per barrel decline can therefore drive a substantial improvement in the current account,” said Neelkanth Mishra, India equity strategist at Credit Suisse.
The development will also give much needed comfort to the finance ministry as the Centre tries to meet the fiscal deficit target of 4.1 per cent in 2014-15.
“The fiscal deficit target seems much more achievable now than at the start of the year. While revenue from disinvestment will give a boost to the finances, on the expenditure side, savings from lower crude oil prices could help bring down the fuel subsidy bill,” said a government official.
The Union Budget had allocated Rs 63,427 crore as fuel subsidy in 2014-15. But over the last two months, global crude oil prices have been much lower.
For calculating the Budget Estimates, the finance ministry has taken global crude oil prices at $110 per barrel and the exchange rate at Rs 61 to the dollar.
“The current trend of oil prices and a decline in the Asian Premium will have a beneficial impact on GDP and investor outlook,” said Nilesh Shah, CEO, Axis Capital.
The inflation too is expected to witness some softening and that may help RBI’s ability to go for cut in the interest rates. “As underlying the price of every item like labour and energy costs, and petrol and diesel prices in India are now as per the market price of crude, the fall in oil can also impact inflation over 4-5 months,” said Mishra.

Business loss led Selvarajan into the hands of PakspiesPrint
Written by Arun Janardhanan | Chennai | Posted: September 13, 2014 2:22 am
It was a phone call made by a drunk Arun Selvarajan, 28, to one of his friends on Tuesday night, boasting of his international links and funding sources, that gave the NIA the clinching lead. The alleged spy was arrested by the agency the following day in Chennai.
According to the NIA, Selvarajan, a Sri Lankan national, hails from Jaffna and had been spying on vital installations in Chennai at the behest of a Pakistan embassy official in Colombo. He illegally possessed two passports, a PAN card and made frequent trips to Kochi, Bangalore and Hyderabad.
Friends of Selvarajan were not willing to reveal anything about him to The Indian Express. A leading model in the city who walked for events organised by the alleged spy said she does not want to recall anything about him. “We are all shocked to see the news reports,” she said. Another model refused to comment.
His parents and siblings in Colombo are yet to contact the Indian authorities over his arrest.
A senior official said Selvarajan was under the surveillance of the NIA for several months, especially after the arrest of Thameem Ansari, another alleged spy for Pakistan, who was caught by the Tamil Nadu Police in 2012.
“We have been overhearing his phone conversations for several months. We are now retrieving his communication logs from Skype and Viber accounts,” the official said.
Son of a businessman from Jaffna, Selvarajan spent three years in an international school in Chennai before his father shifted the business back to Jaffna in 2003. The same year, he failed his Class 10 exam and for the next three years remained at home. “He was given Rs 1 crore (Sri Lankan currency) by his father to start a business in 2006 and he opened Hotel Atlantic in Colombo that year,” said the officer.
Selvarajan, according to the NIA, was caught up in the hands of Pakistani agents after he suffered a loss in his business in 2007.

Sluggish IIP  sticky inflation may prolong RBI ratepauseThe RBI is scheduled to review its monetary policy on September 30.
ENS Economic Bureau | New Delhi | Posted: September 13, 2014 2:22 am | Updated: September 13, 2014 10:38 am
Even as the retail inflation during August eased marginally to 7.8 per cent from 7.96 per cent, the industrial production growth in July plummeted to a four-month low of 0.5 per cent, posing a huge challenge to the Reserve Bank to strike a balance between falling investments and reining in inflation while reviewing its monetary policy.
The RBI is scheduled to review its monetary policy on September 30 and experts are of the view that the key interest rates would be left untouched as the central bank works towards 6 per cent retail inflation by January 2016. According to the consumer price index (CPI) data released by the government, retail inflation eased on the back of declining prices of vegetables, cereals and petroleum products. In August 2013, retail inflation was at 9.52 per cent.
However, even as the CPI declined, food inflation during the month rose to 9.42 per cent over 9.36 per cent in July, a development that will make it difficult for the RBI to cut interest rates. Meanwhile, the index of industrial production (IIP) declined to an abysmal 0.5 per cent in July compared to 3.4 per cent achieved in June and 5 per cent in May.
Calling it a worrying development, India Inc said that government should immediately implement the ‘Make in India’ policy to boost manufacturing sector, which contracted 1 per cent during the month. The policy was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his address to the nation on the Independence Day. “While we were hoping that slowdown in manufacturing had bottomed out, it appears it may not out be out of the woods. It is worrying that deceleration in July is somewhat broad based extending to consumer durables and capital goods,” Sidharth Birla, president, Ficci, said.
Saugata Bhattacharya, chief economist of Axis Bank, said that the higher IIP numbers witnessed in the first quarter were largely a function of base effect. “Consumer durables have not fared well due to poor export show in gems and jewellery sector and not-so-good performance by sectors like mobile phones. Deficient rains have also played spoilsport. However, in second half of the year, we will see a pick up. IIP should be in range of 4.1-4.2 per cent in 2014-15,” he said.
Capital goods contracted 3.8 per cent as against growth of 15.7 per cent in July 2013 whereas consumer durables declined 20.9 per cent as against a contraction of 9.6 per cent in July 2013.
During July, the electricity generation posted a robust growth of 11.7 per cent compared to 5.2 per cent during the corresponding year-ago period and the mining sector posted 2.1 per cent growth compared to a contraction of 3 per cent in the same period last fiscal.
Reacting to the inflation and IIP numbers, Care Ratings said that the inflationary possibility stemming from lower kharif continued…

Naveen accepts Advocate GeneralsresignationPrint
Written by Debabrata Mohanty | Bhubaneswar | Posted: September 13, 2014 2:20 am
The Naveen Patnaik government Friday accepted the resignation of Advocate General Ashok Mohanty, four months after he decided to step down.
Mohanty, who was appointed as AG in 2009, had submitted his resignation letter after Naveen was elected for the fourth consecutive term as CM in May.
Last year, Mohanty’s name cropped up over a controversial property deal with chit fund accused and chief of Artha Tatwa group Pradip Sethy. The deal was finalised when the Orissa Police were on the lookout for Sethy who had allegedly duped lakhs of depositors. The AG is reported to have taken possession of the property in Cuttack from Sethy on March 22, 2013 when several criminal cases were already registered against the latter. Sources said the government accepted the resignation as itdid not want to be embarrassed by the prospect of its AG being grilled by the CBI, probing the chit fund scam.

SC to examine Maharashtra bid for complete ban on dancebarsPrint
Written by Utkarsh Anand | New Delhi | Posted: September 13, 2014 2:18 am
The Maharashtra government’s attempt, ostensibly to nullify the ruling that had paved the way for dance bar owners to lift their shutters once again, came under the scrutiny of the Supreme Court Friday. The court agreed to test, yet again, the validity of the state government’s endeavour to implement a total ban on dance bars and dance performances.
A bench led by Justice S J Mukhopadhaya issued notices to the Maharashtra government and others, seeking their explanation as to how the amendment, aimed at plugging the legal loophole which had led the court quash the ban in 2013, did not impinge upon the right to earn livelihood of bar dancers and owners of such establishments.
The court sought replies from all parties within four weeks, as senior counsel Jayant Bhushan urged the bench to examine if the state could have enacted an identical prohibition by way of legislation after the court had already quashed such a provision by its July 2013 judgment.
In this judgment, the court had upheld the right of women bar dancers to follow their profession and dismissed the government’s appeal to ban them. It had directed the government to process licences to run them. Slamming the Maharashtra government for its “elitist” and “discriminatory” attitude, the court had junked the government’s justification to ban dance bars on grounds that they were obscene and acted as pick-up points for vulnerable girls, while allowing such performances at big hotels.
However, the state cabinet, in an apparent endeavour to overcome this obstacle, subsequently decided to extend the ban to high-end hotels and private clubs too. It chose to drop a provision from the Bombay Police Act that allowed dance performances in “exempted” establishments like three-star and five-star hotels but banned it elsewhere.
Bhushan told the bench that the prohibition trampled upon the fundamental right to carry any occupation, trade or business to earn one’s livelihood, although the July 2013 verdict made it clear that the state had failed in establishing that such restrictions would be reasonable or be in the interest of general public.
The Indian Express had on June 14 highlighted how the Maharashtra government cited the Supreme Court to justify its proposal for a blanket ban on dance bars but refrained from unveiling how it’s twisting the ruling and ignoring the key points the court made on women’s rights and their security.
The court had said: “A large number of imaginative alternative steps could be taken instead of completely prohibiting dancing if the real concern of the state is the safety of women.” It had added: “It would be more appropriate to bring about measures which should ensure the safety and improve the working conditions of the persons working as bar girls.”
The court had then unequivocally told the Maharashtra government: “In our opinion, in the present case, the restrictions in the nature of prohibition cannot be said to be reasonable, inasmuch as there could be several lesser alternatives available which would have been adequate to ensure safety of women than to completely prohibit dance.”

Apex court allows ailing marine to travel toItalyPrint
Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: September 13, 2014 2:15 am
Taking on record Centre’s ‘no objection’, the Supreme Court Friday allowed Massimiliano Latorre, one of the two Italian marines facing murder charges in India, to travel to his country for medical treatment for four months.
A bench led by Chief Justice of India R M Lodha however clarified that its order on relief will become operational only after Latorre, who suffered brain stroke on August 31, gives an “unequivocal” and “unambiguous” undertaking of the dates of departure and his arrival back to India. The bench, also comprising Justices Kurian Joseph and Rohinton F Nariman, expressed displeasure at various contentions, including the one relating to the jurisdictional issue, raised by Lattore in his undertaking. It refused to accept such an “equivocal” undertaking and asked him to furnish a fresh one, which was succinct and plain.
The court accepted a separate undertaking furnished by Italian Ambassador Daniele Mancini on behalf of the Republic of Italy, stating that the ailing marine would abide by all terms and conditions set for his travel to his native country.
“Having heard the counsel, we are of the view that applicant be permitted to travel to Italy for his treatment for a period of four months,” the bench said. It added that “since the Government of India has no objection in principle on the plea of the applicant (Latorre), we direct that authorities here will facilitate his travel”.
The bench said the condition for the relief granted to Latorre would be same as set by the apex court on February 22, 2013 when the two marines were allowed to travel to Italy under the control and custody of the Ambassador of Italy in India, to cast their ballot in the elections. Latorre and fellow marine Salvatore Girone are currently barred from leaving India, pending a possible trial under murder charge for shooting two fishermen while serving as part of an anti-piracy mission on an Italian-flagged oil tanker, Enrica Lexie, off the Kerala coast in February 2012.
They have been living at the Italian embassy, in the custody of the Supreme Court. The court is to decide on the validity of the probe conducted by the National Investigation Agency against them, besides the other aspects relating to sending them up for trial under various charges.

Toyota on Tuesday unveiled details of its U2 — an urban utility concept car vehicle — that highlights the automaker’s thinking about how small, useful cars should be built as people congregate in dense city centers.

Developed by Toyota’s Calty Design Research in Newport Beach, the U2 has a roof that rolls back, a tailgate that can be folded down into a ramp and cargo space that can be customized through a versatile rail system. The concept car — whose name is pronounced "U-squared" — will make its first public appearance at the World Maker Faire in New York starting Sept. 20.
“Toyota saw an opportunity for a new approach to an urban vehicle based on increasing reurbanization of our cities and urban drivers’ desire for flexibility, fun and maneuverability,” said Kevin Hunter, president of Calty, Toyota’s North American design studio.
The concept vehicle features graphics that advertise “Custom Fixies,” a kind of bicycle favored by bike messengers and youthful urban bike riders.

“Calty keeps a number of projects concealed while exploring ideas and products,” he said. “Revealing a project like the U2 gives people a window into the constant innovation that happens inside Toyota and our Calty studios and one possible future for urban mobility.”
Toyota doesn’t have plans to bring the vehicle to market at this time.
Calty’s design team was attempting to capture a sense of American entrepreneurship and love of adventure, especially outdoor activities involving gear and equipment, as it worked on the U2. That’s why the vehicle was designed to act as “a flexible, functional gadget,” Hunter said.
The retractable utility bar, for example, can hold a desk or grocery bag hooks. Side windows flip up for easy access from roadside. Even the front passenger seat can be removed. The boxlike design enhances storage.
Because dense, poorly maintained city streets feature bumper-to-bumper traffic, potholes and tight corners, the U2 concept is designed to be small, rugged and nimble. Its durable underbody should better handle pothole-pocked streets.
That is bad ass I would love to have one of those.

Hormel is one of four companies that have seen analysts boost their adjusted profit forecasts by 3% or more. (Toby Talbot, AP)
Things are getting better all the time. At least that’s what most companies try to tell their investors. But investors are actually believing it in notable cases.
Four companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500, including electronic chipmaker Avago (AVGO) , online retailer Amazon.com (AMZN) and Spam processor Hormel (HRL) , have seen analysts bump up their forecasts for adjusted profit this calendar year by 3% or more from 30 days ago, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from S&P Capital IQ. The analysis includes only non-financial companies.
Yes, it’s still early to be talking about 2014 profit. But remember that investors anticipate — not just react.
Such boosts to profits will be a pivotal force that could keep the market moving higher. Analysts are calling for S&P 500 companies to deliver 9.6% earnings growth for 2014, says S&P Capital IQ. Yet, the market is in an information vacuum — now that earnings season for the second quarter has wrapped up and companies are wrapping up the third quarter. Investors are paying close attention to companies where outlooks are improving.
Just Thursday, grocery store chain Kroger (KR) told investors it expects profit for fiscal 2014 to be roughly 0.6% higher than previously forecasted. The stock is down $0.17, or 0.3%, to $51.69 as investors probably wanted more.
And that’s where the four companies with the biggest increases come in. The company with the largest increase to forecasts is Avago Technologies, which makes power amplifiers and telecom equipment. The company is now expected to post adjusted earnings of $5.41 for calendar 2014. That’s up nearly 27% from analysts’ forecasts just 30 days ago. Missing the rising expectations has been costly. Shares of the company’s stock are up 24.8% over the past 30 days as investors get ahead of the rising forecasts.
Analysts are also ramping up expectations for online retailer Amazon.com. Analysts are calling for adjusted earnings of $0.15, which is a 5% improvement from 30 days ago. Likewise, shares of Amazon are up 3.8% over the past 30 days.
Below are the four companies in the S&P 500 where analysts have boosted their adjusted earnings targets for calendar 2014 by the most:

NRI investments in realty sector may rise: S...Assocham
(Property developers are…)
NEW DELHI: Property developers are expecting a 35 per cent surge in real estate enquiries from NRIs, with Bangalore turning out to be the hot favourite, says an Assocham survey.
To tap the growing interest which comes at a time when the global economy is stabilising and India is showing strong signs of revival, real estate companies are pulling out all stops by conducting property shows, exhibitions and opening overseas representative offices.
Developers are also expanding their existing distribution chains and entering into strategic partnerships to encourage investors from this cash-rich segment, it said.
The survey was conducted among nearly 850 real estate developers in Delhi-NCR, Chandigarh, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Pune, Dehradun and Chennai etc.
Bangalore is the most favourite property investment destination for NRIs, followed by Ahmedabad, Pune, Chennai, Goa, Delhi and Dehradun, it added.
The enquiries are primarily coming from NRIs residing in UAE, the US, Singapore, Australia, the UK, Canada and South Africa.
This year, the demand is more for the high-end property and commercial buildings, according to developers.
"With the revival in global economy, especially in the United States and Europe, people are more optimistic and looking for property to invest in.
"Both small and big developers are focusing on the NRI base in the US, the UK and Asia Pacific region this year," said Assocham Secretary General D S Rawat .
As per the findings of the survey, Ahemdabad (32 per cent) continues to be the most stable market in terms of demand and absorption of both residential and commercial spaces.
NRIs consider Ahmedabad as a safe place to invest in, with lenient government regulations for property investments.
Pune takes the 3rd place (30.5 per cent), whereas Chennai (28 per cent) assumes 4th position and Goa (23 per cent) is at 5th position.
In Delhi, there has been a 21 per cent rise in enquiries this year as opposed to last year from this segment and the majority of them have been for the residential segment.
Catering to the growing demand among high-end segment, Delhi has also emerged among promising markets for real estate, the survey added.

Falling oil price tilts political, economic balance in US favour

Bank of America-Merrill Lynch
(Higher oil production from…)
LONDON/KUWAIT: The drop in oil prices to their lowest in two years has caught many observers off guard, coming against a backdrop of the worst violence in Iraq this decade, heightened tensions between the West and Russia, and sanctions against Iran.
But as rising supplies of North American crude and tepid demand have pushed prices below $100 a barrel, the move underlies how the shale oil revolution is creating a political and economic advantage for Washington and its Western allies.
Russia and Iran are heavily reliant on oil sales and face budget shortages at current price levels, analysts say, weakening their position when negotiating over Ukrainian sovereignty or the Iranian nuclear deal.
And higher oil production from the United States as well as Canada is providing a buffer against the threat of retaliatory supply curbs from Russia or further disruptions to supplies from the Middle East.
"The increase in production is definitely benefiting the United States," said Professor Paul Stevens at the Chatham House think tank in London.
"The Russians are very exposed to lower oil prices. We don't know to what extent it will influence their behaviour in Ukraine, but they're certainly going to feel pressure on their budget."
Russia's rouble currency has already fallen to a historic low against the dollar as its economy is hit by sanctions from the United States and European Union over its involvement in Ukraine. That increases the price Russians must pay for many imports, from vegetables to luxury goods.
Daily oil production in the United States has risen sharply since the financial crisis. In 2010 the country still imported half of the crude it consumed, but the US Energy Information Administration forecasts that will fall to little more than 20 percent next year.
Even as the United States has largely maintained its ban on exporting crude, it has left a lot of barrels from West Africa and the Middle East looking for new homes. While US energy company profits might take a hit from lower prices, consumers will benefit more from spending less at the pump.
For Iran, a lower oil price not only harms its economy, already hit by sanctions that specifically try to cut its oil sales. It also means there is less pressure on the West to reach a deal quickly over Tehran's nuclear programme.
With oil prices falling, the immediate economic incentive of getting Iranian barrels smoothly back to the world market is diminished, analysts say, allowing Western powers more leeway to drive a harder deal.
Some energy analysts even say Islamic State, which has captured a number of oilfields in Syria and Iraq, will be hurt by lower oil prices as it is forced to discount further the black market sales that help fund the militant group.
"Recent advances by the Islamic State (IS) have disrupted Middle East politics and shifted incentives for key regional and global players," Bank of America-Merrill Lynch analyst Francisco Blanch said this week, arguing that US ally Saudi Arabia may be comfortable with lower prices.
"Lower oil would hurt IS, Iran and Russia, but help the West," Blanch said, adding that he saw the breakeven price for Russia's budget at around $105 a barrel.
 
OPEC REACTION
For Saudi Arabia, the world's largest crude exporter, lower prices may create some short-term budgetary pain, but observers believe the kingdom is willing to absorb the impact as it does greater damage to regional rivals such as Iran.
Saudi Arabia has said for years that it will supply the world with the oil it needs.
"Have you ever seen me concerned?" Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said on Thursday in Kuwait when asked whether the price fall was worrying the kingdom.
"This is not the first time prices change, they always change. It's a dynamic process," he told Reuters.
Other Gulf delegates attending a meeting of oil ministers from the region said the price drop was unlikely to spur action from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) unless crude fell below $85 a barrel.
"It is a fact which is bound to focus minds in the Gulf and in wider OPEC but we also need to remember that this follows many months with good prices from their point of view," Samuel Ciszuk, senior adviser on energy security to the Swedish Energy Agency, told the Reuters Global Oil Forum.
Saudi Arabia is likely to "micromanage" supplies at it has for a number of years, Ciszuk said, but it was unlikely to push for an official OPEC supply cut.
While US oil output has been rising fast, part of the big jump in supplies has come from countries that remain at risk of supply disruptions, including Libya and Nigeria.
"No fundamental improvement in the stability of those countries has actually taken place, which means that the added supply is extremely vulnerable," Ciszuk said.
Libya's oil production has rebounded to more than 800,000 barrels per day, the National Oil Corp said this week, eight times the amount of just a few months ago.
But the increase, which followed a deal to end a near year-long rebel port blockade, has come at a time when the government is losing control of the country, with an armed group taking over the capital Tripoli last week.
For now, however, the US-led surge in supply and weak demand have seen traders start to store additional barrels as they wait for prices to recover.
"Given the volatile situation in the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region," the International Energy Agency said, "this is a benefit to global energy security."

US hits Russia's largest bank, energy sector with sanctions

(The United States hit Russia's…)
WASHINGTON: The United States hit Russia's top bank and leading energy and technology companies with sanctions Friday, to punish Moscow for supporting separatist rebels in Ukraine.
In the latest sanctions, Washington slapped tight controls on financing for Sberbank, pipeline giant Transneft , energy firms Lukoil , Gazprom, Gazpromneft and Surgutneftgas and state technology group Rostec.
The White House actions followed similar sanctions imposed by Europe aimed at placing pressure on the Russian economy over the country's interference in neighboring Ukraine.
"Given Russia's direct military intervention and blatant efforts to destabilize Ukraine , we have deepened our sanctions against Russia today, in concert with our European allies," said US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew .
"These steps underscore the continued resolve of the international community against Russia's aggression."
The US sanctions ban American entirities from offering anything but short-term financing to the Russian companies listed, a move that could restrict their business activities and long-term planning.
For example, and US citizen or group is not allowed to lend money to Sberbank for more 30 days maturity of the debt.
A similar 30-day financing restriction was put in place for dealings with Rostec.
For Lukoil, Gazprom, and Surgutneftgas, US entities are blocked from providing any support, materials or technology for any oil and gas exploration projects involving the Arctic region, offshore anywhere or shale-based resources.
The same restrictions were also applied to oil giant Rosneft, which was already listed under a previous round of sanctions.
"Russia's economic and diplomatic isolation will continue to grow as long as its actions do not live up to its words," said Lew.
"Russia's economy is already paying a heavy price for its unlawful behavior. Growth has fallen to near zero, inflation is well above target, and Russian financial markets continue to deteriorate."

5 Ways to Optimize Your Video Content and YouTube ChannelIf you've been hard-at-work creating content, then you're probably aware at how powerful of video has become. If you weren't up-to-date on the popularity and influence that video content has, here are some mind-blowing stats courtesy of Digital Sherpa :
One-third of all online activity is spent watching video
100 million internet users watch an online video everyday
Videos increase people's understanding of a product or service by 74%
Every month the average internet user is exposed to an average of 32.2 videos
Of course, when it comes to video there's no bigger giant than YouTube. The Google-owned site has more than one billion unique visitors each month, has over 6 billion hours of watched videos every month and has 100 hours of uploaded videos every minute.
About a month ago I launched a new startup venture called Host . We've started putting up videos to take advantage of this trend.  With so many options out there how can you make sure that you're incredible video doesn't get lost in the crowd? After all, why go through the trouble of creating something of high-quality if it isn't going to be seen?
Well, that shouldn't be a concern if you follow the 5 ways to optimize your video content and YouTube channel.
1. Set Up Your Channel
If you want to stand-out from the pack and brand yourself, then capture the attention viewers with a sleek design. While you can't customize your YouTube channel like you could in the past, you can add important features like your logo, social media icons, profile information and background color.
Mashable also suggested that you also do the following in their 5 Tips to Design the Best YouTube Channel Page:
Post a trailer - a short clip that best represents your brand.
Have an optimized name and description - keep in mind that your channel name and description will appear in search engines as well, so make it appealing.
Make it visually appealing - it's suggested that the dimensions be 2560x1440 px.
Keep you channel active - post videos and respond to comments frequently.
2. Tagging and Titles
How are people going to discover your videos? Through tags and titles. And, since YouTube happens to be the third most popular website in the world, this is an extremely important tactic to remember if you want to rank for certain keywords.
Here are some basic guidelines on how to effectively achieve tags and titles:
Include relevant keywords in your title.
The title should be under 66 characters.
Use the word "video" in the description.
Write a unique description of your video.
Keep the description at around 800 words.
Make sure your primary keywords are in the beginning of the description.
Include exact keyword phrases when tagging.
Use Google Trends to discover relevant keywords.
3. Annotations
Engaging your audience is one of the best ways to optimize your video content and YouTube Channel. And you can effectively increase engagement through annotations.
Annotations are "clickable text overlays on YouTube" that include everything from background information on the video, links to related videos/websites, or a visible subscription option. One of the most common practices for annotations is through strong call-to-action-overlays.
Effective CTAs should be creative and placed in plain sight of the viewer in the YouTube page, actual video or video description. Remember, the point of your CTA is to direct visitors to what you want them to do next. So, if if you want them to subscribe to your channel then make that clear. Just keep in mind that you don't want to bombard viewers with call-to-actions. That just comes across as spammy.
4. Thumbnails
Think of thumbnails as miniature banners for your videos. When thumbnails can effectively represent your brand, you'll be able to attract viewers. In fact, thumbnails have the ability to significantly increase search clicks ( 64% for men, 154% for women ).
Its suggested by YouTube that you follow these suggested visual guidelines:
Clear, in-focus, hi-resolution (640px x 360px min., 16:9 aspect ratio)
Bright, high-contrast

Uber Just Caved on a Big Policy Change After Its Drivers Threatened to StrikeDrivers gather outside Uber's office to protest recent policy changes.

Uber is famously unafraid of clashing with government regulators. But it might just be terrified of taking on its own drivers.
While Uber has brashly forged ahead with its ride-sharing service in the face of stiff opposition from German authorities (not to mention other protests across Europe), the company on Friday abruptly backed down from recent policy changes that had stirred protests and strikes among as many as 1,000 drivers in New York City. Uber infuriated workers on Labor Day when it said that drivers of its higher-end "Black" and "SUV" services would be sent UberX and UberXL fares as well. "Starting now, all BLACK and SUV partners will automatically receive uberX / uberXL requests," the company wrote in an email on Sept. 1. Some drivers chose to decline those requests; over the next two weeks, they were told by Uber that declining too many rides could risk deactivating their accounts.

[Update, Sept. 12, 2 p.m.: Here's a bit more background on these various tiers of Uber service. UberX and UberXL are the cheapest services Uber offers in New York City , billed as "the low cost Uber" and "low-cost rides for groups," respectively. The fare minimum for UberX rides is $8 and it's $12 on UberXL, while rides on UberBlack and UberSUV—the company's higher-end car services—start at $15 and $25. The more upscale services also have higher base fares and charge riders more per minute and per mile.]
Chakib Seddiki, an Uber SUV driver who has worked with the company in New York for two and a half years, said he knows several people who had their accounts shut down for 24-hour periods over the last week after they declined too many UberX requests. Seddiki's own account was deactivated from 4 p.m. on Monday until 4 p.m. on Tuesday, and he was told that if his ride acceptance rate fell below 90 percent it would be turned off again. Ifram Chaudri, an Uber SUV driver of eight months, said Uber shut down his account from Wednesday afternoon until Thursday afternoon for a similar reason. Chaudri and Seddiki provided Slate with the messages that Uber sent them upon deactivating and reactivating their accounts:

Late on Friday morning, Uber abruptly backtracked. "Effective immediately, UberBLACK and UberSUV partners can choose when and where to receive UberX requests," the company wrote in an email blast sent to drivers. Further down in the message, it showed an option on the Uber app that allows drivers to switch between accepting UberX rides and limiting requests to only Black and SUV customers. When asked for comment, Uber pointed to that email.
Drivers say Uber's brief decision to make them accept UberX fares was the latest in a string of shifts that have made working for the company steadily less profitable. Over the summer, Uber slashed fares on UberX by 20 percent to make it " cheaper than a New York City taxi ." At the same time, it has increased the share it takes from drivers. Uber now collects 20 percent of UberX fares (up from 10 percent), 25 percent on Uber Black fares (up from 20 percent), and the same 28 percent on Uber SUV fares.
Uber defends its price cuts and push for drivers to use UberX by arguing that servicing more frequent, albeit cheaper, fares actually leads to increased income for drivers. "[U]berX demand has grown dramatically over the last year, to the point where uberX partners have actually been earning MORE per hour than UberBLACK drivers, after all deductions and expenses," a company representative wrote in an email to Seddiki. "To address this and help boost BLACK and SUV partner earnings, we allowed partners to opt-in to accepting uberX/XL trips over the summer. The results were dramatic: drivers who accepted X and XL trips earned 35-50% more per hour on average than those who did not. While partners sometimes had slightly higher gas and operating costs from doing more trips, our summer test showed that drivers’ increased earnings more than covered this cost."

Uber isn't a ride-sharing service.  It's a cab company.  Ride-sharing would involve matching up drivers who are planning on going in a particular direction with riders who also need to go that way.   More...

Seddiki contests this math. His own experience shows that it takes, on average, 10 minutes to drive to get an UberX fare and then another five to 10 minutes for that person to come out for the ride. From there, it takes about 10 minutes to complete the usually short rides UberX passengers take. Altogether, that's 30 minutes for which Seddiki typically gets the $8 minimum. Uber's 20 percent commission deducts $1.60 and sales tax and black car fees take out another $0.80. Because Uber drivers are contractors and not employees, they also have to cover any expenses they incur while working. For half an hour of driving, Seddiki expects his SUV to consume about $2 worth of gas—much more than the hybrid vehicles used by most UberX drivers will eat up in the same period. "That means before car depreciation and insurance, I end up with $3.60 from $8," he says. "If we look at it by the hour, that will be $7.20."
Protests against Uber over wages have already broken out in other parts of the country. On Sept. 2, around 50 Los Angeles–based Uber drivers gathered in a North Hollywood parking lot to rail against recent fare cuts. Earlier this week, 200 drivers assembled outside Uber's office in Santa Monica to further protest the pay cuts and their treatment by the company. Uber has also been hit with several class actions over its practice of including tips in the commission it collects from drivers. By conceding to drivers on the UberX policy—admittedly a rare step for Uber to take—the company is likely preventing days of bad press and protests that could draw consumers attention to the unrest and accusations of bad labor practices.
Despite Uber's reversal, organizers said on the Uber Drivers Network NYC Facebook page that the strikes planned for Friday will continue and that a meeting scheduled for 4 p.m. in Queens will still take place. "This is a victory for us," the network posted on its page. "However our fight MUST continue, because we've won a battle but the war is not over."
Uber is of course interested in keeping rates low to provide its customers with the cheapest fares and most efficient service possible. But riders are only one half of Uber's platform. And in a market brimming with competition, aggravated drivers have other companies they can choose to work with. Already, Chaudri and Seddiki say they have seen colleagues abandon Uber for its main competitor, Lyft. "In the beginning Uber was very nice with us. Now when you go to the office they treat you like a slave," says Chaudri, who has also started taking rides for Lyft's platform. "When Lyft asked me if I had any questions, I said only one: You will be smiley and nice with us all the time or just for a few months, like Uber?"

New Apple iPhone 6 Plus pre-order shipments to be delayed by a monthMany customers will have to wait three to four weeks to get their hands on Apple Inc's larger screen iPhone 6 Plus after pre-orders for Sept. 19 delivery were booked out within hours
ET SPECIAL:
ET Special: All you want to know about Apple iPhone 6
Customers may have to wait three to four weeks to get their hands on Apple Inc's iPhone 6 Plus, after a record number of orders for the company's latest smartphones strained available supply.
The new iPhone 6 goes on sale on Sept. 19 in the United States but the company began taking online orders on Thursday. While the larger 5.5-inch "Plus" models now display a wait time of up to a month, the 4.7-inch version remains available for delivery on September 19, Apple's website showed.
Verizon Wireless , AT&T and Sprint Corp , also showed shipment delays of up to six weeks on their respective websites. Apple said the pace of orders has so far outstripped any of its previous iPhones.
"Response to iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus has been incredible, with a record number of pre-orders overnight. Pre-orders are currently available online or through the Apple Store App," spokeswoman Trudy Muller said.
Apple routinely grapples with iPhone supply constraints, particularly in years that involve a smartphone re-design. The latest iPhones come with larger screens and some analysts had anticipated that production issues may keep a lid on initial runs.
Its suppliers had scrambled to get enough screens ready because the need to redesign a key component had disrupted panel production, supply chain sources told Reuters last month.
It was unclear whether the hiccup could limit the number of phones available to consumers, the sources said at the time. Apple declined to comment on supply chain issues.
In addition, Chinese customers may also have to wait until the year-end before they can buy the iPhone 6. Apple is yet to set a release date for China, the world's biggest smartphone market.
The company unveiled its latest iPhones along with a watch and a mobile payments service on Tuesday.
AT&T's chief executive of mobile and business, Ralph de la Vega, told investors at a conference in New York that iPhone 6 orders have so far surpassed orders last year and the year before.
"It is such a great thing to wake up in the morning to know that you have hundreds of thousands of orders already before you even have a cup of coffee," said the executive.
Apple's iPhones tend to incite the kind of initial buying frenzy unknown to many other brands, partly because of the company's well-honed marketing tactics.
On secondary markets online, the rights to a pre-ordered iPhone 6 Plus are worth as much as double the unsubsidized sticker price. One eBay auction for an unlocked 128-gigabyte gold version of the 5.5-inch phone, for example, was bidding at $1,625 on Friday afternoon, compared with a face value of $949.
One post on the New York City edition of Craigslist sought $10,000 the privilege to "be one of the first & few people to own this model and before the rest of the world."
New iPhones tend to get listed at stratospheric prices on various online retail sites from the United States to China, on the assumption that there's big demand from people who must get their hands on the phone from day one. That in turns fuels a grey market of dealers who buy in bulk for resale.

Email services like Gmail may be banned for ...Email services like Gmail and Yahoo! may be banned for government's official use
PTI Sep 12, 2014, 08.33PM IST
(A proposal to this effect…)
NEW DELHI: Popular email services like Gmail and Yahoo! are likely to be banned for official use to safeguard critical and sensitive government data.
A proposal to this effect is being moved by Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DeitY) for Cabinet approval by month-end, sources said.
Government communication, barring those of Ministry of Defence and External Affairs, will be done using the platform of the National Informatics Centre (NIC), they added.
While Defence Ministry has its own separate secure email server, the External Affairs too may follow suit.
The move comes amid concerns about rising cybercrime and hacking incidents. Earlier this week, five million usernames and passwords of Google were reported to have been leaked online by Russian hackers.
Government is expected to route official communication through the National Informatics Centre's (NIC) email service.
DeitY has drafted the policy on use of email for government offices and departments and views and comments of ministries concerned are being taken on this, sources said.
Sources said the policy seeks to protect large amount of critical government data and aims to make it mandatory for government offices to communicate only on nic.in platform, not on commercial email services Gmail, Yahoo!, Hotmail, etc.
The policy is expected to cover about 5-6 lakh Central and state government employees for using the email service provided by NIC, they added.
To ensure smooth working of the NIC platform, DeitY will soon require about Rs 4-5 crore to ramp up NIC infrastructure.
Besides, a total investment of around Rs 50-100 crore would be required for full operationability of the policy, including integrating emails with cloud so that official data can be saved on a cloud platform and can then be easily shared with the concerned government ministries and departments.
Governments globally have also been trying to secure their official communication post fallout of the Snowden saga, which contended the US intelligence agencies used a secret data- mining programme to monitor worldwide Internet data to spy on various countries, including India.

A Cringe-Inducing Evening With Jordan Belfort  the Real Wolf of Wall StreetMuch sleazier when it's not an ad campaign.

This article originally appeared in Business Insider.
Hundreds of people (mostly men) packed the house at the 92nd Street Y in Manhattan's Upper East Side to see the real-life "Wolf of Wall Street," Jordan Belfort. 
Advertisement
Belfort is the author of a best-selling tell-all memoir that chronicled his boozy, drug-fueled, high-flying Wall Street lifestyle running 1990s-era boiler room Stratton Oakmont. The convicted felon’s book was adapted into a film directed by Martin Scorsese starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Belfort was arrested in 1998. In 2003, he was convicted for securities fraud and money laundering. He served a 22-month prison sentence after being sentenced to four years. He was also  ordered to pay $110.4 million  in restitution to victims of Stratton Oakmont's. He  hasn't finished paying them back yet , either.
Wednesday night's "Trial & Error" program at the Y was co-produced by NYU Law's Forum on Law, Culture & Society. In addition to Belfort, the panel featured former federal prosecutor Daniel Alonso and CNBC anchor Kelly Evans. The program was produced by attorney Joel Seidemann. He's a former assistant district attorney in New York. His LinkedIn profile says he now works at JPMorgan Chase. 
Seidemann gave a train wreck of an introduction. It really set the tone for the evening, which was uncomfortable. First, he joked that there wouldn't be any "scantily clad girls" at the event. "It's just going to be stimulation from the neck up." He also threw in a Casey Anthony and O.J. Simpson joke.
"We never had a defendant who was actually convicted. It's not for lack of trying. ... I did invite Casey Anthony, but she was looking for Zanny the Nanny. We did invite O.J., but he wouldn't leave his gated community in Nevada." 
It gets worse ... 
Then, he introduced CNBC anchor Kelly Evans. It was awkward: He said something along the lines of "We need a fox on this panel of wolves." 
There was some laughter and some boos from the audience. "Sexissssst huh-huh-huh," the guy in the suit next to me said. "It's not easy for anyone to be associated with the word 'fox,'" Seidemann went on rambling something about Fox News.
Evans, 29, is the star anchor at CNBC. She's incredibly smart and commands the respect of the biggest names on the Street with her coverage of economics and the financial markets. We reached out to Seidemann on Thursday morning for comment about his introduction of Evans. He did not respond at the time of publication. 
Professor Thane Rosenbaum, who was the forum's director and panel's moderator, reached out to apologize, even though the comments didn't come from him. "I'm really sorry about all of it. I surely would not have invited Kelly for the forum to have her offended. It was very hard to sit on stage and watch that. I was truly sorry." Evans had no comment when Business Insider reached out. Despite the cringeworthy intro, Evans handled herself with incredible poise throughout the entire panel. 
The panel began with Belfort saying it was "strange" for him to be at the 92nd Street Y, especially because he wasn't being paid. "Listen, you know, it's kind of a strange situation for me to be here. You know, I go around the world and I'm a speaker and I teach people entrepreneurship, sales, and that sort of stuff for a living. And, so, um I know I'm going to subject myself to a lot of I guess border-line abuse here. Start very quickly. It's very negative here ... " 
"Well, you weren't called a 'fox,' " Rosenbaum, the panel moderator, said referring to the intro for Evans.
Belfort, who slouched in his seat, complained that he wasn't being paid for this appearance. "I have to say that I have to sit here and listen to this when I'm not getting paid is pretty tough," Belfort said as the audience began laughing. 
Belfort is currently on a global speaking tour, which has been dubbed the "Redemption Tour." He  estimated earlier this year that he thought he could make more than $100 million.
"In my heart, I've redeemed myself," he said. "I live my life in a way in which I am very proud of. I do the right thing every day. I give massive value to my business. I pay a lot more than you said. Your numbers are wildly inaccurate."
"Let's talk ..." Rosenbaum said.
Belfort didn't want to get into the numbers. "Honestly, I can't talk about my finances. I came here to answer questions that were really relevant to the crime, OK? It's a waste of time, I think, OK? So frankly ... but your numbers are grossly inaccurate," Belfort fired back.
"Let's talk about those numbers. It's important to talk about those numbers," Rosenbaum said.
Evans said that she was worried about "the next Jordan Belfort." 
"There's somebody somewhere who is thinking this is going to be great material one day," she said. 
Belfort said people should realize that the actions portrayed in the film were bad and not something they should follow. "If you're in this audience and you can't go to see The Wolf of Wall Street and realize that that's bad, then there's something wrong with you. You are fundamentally screwed up. It's obvious," Belfort said. Belfort said that he idolized Gordon Gekko's character in Oliver Stone's Wall Street . He said that had perhaps Gekko fallen, then he would have felt differently. "At least in The Wolf of Wall Street, I lose everything. My life is destroyed. I go to jail," Belfort said.
Evans didn't buy Belfort's argument of his story being a cautionary tale. "I don't think your story is a movie—we're living this story right now. I don't think there are many people who look at 'poor Jordan Belfort' and think, 'Wow, this is a cautionary tale.' He sold out the 92nd Street Y! He's going on a 45-city tour and he's got a TV series that he's ... what?" Evans said. 
Belfort insisted that people like his redemption story. "I did that because I turned my life around over the last year. I'm not out committing crimes right now. People want to believe in redemption stories," Belfort said, adding that the way he lives his life now gives people hope. 
Evans wasn't buying it. "The reason why people press you on your finances is because there's not a real sense that this is a redemption story. There's a sense that this is a story of, 'Wow, look at this thing I did, the time that I served, but I turned it around now and now I'm telling you about it and ..." Evans said.
"People don't press me; journalists do," Belfort fired back to laughter and applause. Evans pointed out that was "selling that story successfully." 
"Should I sell it unsuccessfully?" he said, to more laughs and applause.

Later in the discussion, Evans made a reference to Timothy 6:10, where the Bible says "the love of money is the root of all evil." Belfort responded: "This idea of money as the root of evil is ridiculous. Money is like alcohol. If you're an a--hole, it makes you a bigger a--hole." Belfort added that he liked making money. He also said that he didn't think he should live his life like a monk despite his actions in the past. 

Child pornography conviction overturned because the government violated the Posse Comitatus ActBy Eugene Volokh September 12 Follow @volokhc
United States v. Dreyer (9th Cir. Sept. 12, 2014) (2-to-1 vote); here are excerpts from the majority, the concurrence, and the dissent (some paragraph breaks added, some removed):
A special agent of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) launched an investigation for online criminal activity by anyone in the state of Washington, whether connected with the military or not. The agent found evidence of a crime committed by a civilian in the state and turned it over to civilian law enforcement officials. The civilian, Michael Dreyer, was prosecuted, convicted, and sentenced to eighteen years in prison. We hold that the NCIS agent’s investigation constituted improper military enforcement of civilian laws and that the evidence collected as a result of that investigation should have been suppressed….
The Posse Comitatus Act (PCA), 18 U.S.C. § 1385, “prohibits Army and Air Force military personnel from participating in civilian law enforcement activities.” [Footnote: The PCA states, “Whoever, except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress, willfully uses any part of the Army or the Air Force as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.”] We have previously recognized that, “[a]lthough the PCA does not directly reference the Navy,” “PCA-like restrictions” apply to the Navy as a matter of Department of Defense (DoD) and Naval policy….
The government maintains that, even though PCA-like restrictions apply to the Navy, they do not apply to civilian NCIS agents…. [But] “… while DoD personnel may participate in civilian law enforcement activities in their private capacities, they may not do so under the auspices of the military.” …
More fundamentally, the government’s assertion that there is a meaningful difference between civilian and other employees of the Navy for the purposes of the PCA-like restrictions is unsound. The DoD policies have consistently proclaimed that they set forth “restrictions on participation of DoD personnel in civilian law enforcement activities.” They do not limit their reach to non-civilian personnel only. And any contention to the contrary is belied by the abundantly clear expressions in the most recent regulations and policy instructions. Both state that they “[a]ppl[y] to civilian employees of the DoD Components,” and that their restrictions on direct participation in civilian law enforcement “apply to all actions of DoD personnel worldwide,” with “DoD personnel” defined to include “Federal military officers and enlisted personnel and civilian employees of the Department of Defense.” …
The regulations and policies implementing the PCA and § 375 “generally prohibit ‘direct’ military involvement in civilian law enforcement activities but permit ‘indirect’ assistance such as the transfer of information obtained during the normal course of military operations or other actions that ‘do not subject civilians to [the] use [of] military power that is regulatory, prescriptive, or compulsory.’” Prohibited direct assistance includes “[u]se of military personnel for surveillance or pursuit of individuals, or as undercover agents, informants, investigators, or interrogators.”
We have “set forth three tests for determining whether military involvement in civilian law enforcement constitutes permissible indirect assistance: ‘[1] The involvement must not constitute the exercise of regulatory, proscriptive, or compulsory military power, [2] must not amount to direct active involvement in the execution of the laws, and [3] must not pervade the activities of civilian authorities.’” “If any one of these tests is met, the assistance is not indirect.”
Agent Logan’s RoundUp surveillance of all computers in Washington amounted to impermissible direct active involvement in civilian enforcement of the child pornography laws, not permissible indirect assistance. He acted as an investigator, an activity specifically prohibited as direct assistance….
Also, Agent Logan engaged in his investigation not in any support capacity to civilian law enforcement, but rather as an independent actor who initiated and carried out this activity. His actions thus were not “incidental” to the overall investigation into Dreyer, or limited to backup support. The results of his investigation served as the primary basis for the state search warrant. [Local Police Department] Officer Schrimpsher conducted no significant additional investigation before procuring the warrant — he only verified that Dreyer lived at the address he was given and that the descriptions that Agent Logan provided of the files seemed to describe child pornography. Without Agent Logan’s identification of Dreyer, his computer, and the child pornography on his computer, there would have been no search and no prosecution….
Accordingly, Agent Logan’s actions amounted to direct assistance to civilian law enforcement. The government nonetheless argues that Agent Logan’s investigation was proper because it falls into the “independent military purpose” exception to the prohibition on direct assistance.
The policies and regulations create “an exception to the general prohibition on direct involvement where” there is “an independent military purpose,” that is, “where the military participation is undertaken ‘for the primary purpose of furthering a military or foreign affairs function of the United States, regardless of incidental benefits to civilian authorities.’” Such military activities include “[i]nvestigations and other actions related to enforcement of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.” …
But Agent Logan’s search was not reasonably focused on carrying out such a legitimate military investigation. NCIS is authorized to investigate criminal operations that “significantly affect the naval establishment.” Agent Logan understood that he did not have the authority to search any location, but had to limit his searches to areas where there was “a Department of Navy interest.” Yet, Agent Logan’s search did not meet the required limitation. He surveyed the entire state of Washington for computers sharing child pornography. His initial search was not limited to United States military or government computers, and, as the government acknowledged, Agent Logan had no idea whether the computers searched belonged to someone with any “affiliation with the military at all.” Instead, it was his “standard practice to monitor all computers in a geographic area,” here, every computer in the state of Washington….
Having held that Agent Logan’s investigation violated the restrictions on the use of the military to enforce civilians laws, we consider whether suppression of the resulting evidence should have been ordered here. We have held that “an exclusionary rule should not be applied to violations of 10 U.S.C. §§ 371-378 until a need to deter future violations is demonstrated.” Such a need exists here, as there is evidence of “widespread and repeated violations” of these provisions.
The record here demonstrates that Agent Logan and other NCIS agents routinely carry out broad surveillance activities that violate the restrictions on military enforcement of civilian law. Agent Logan testified that it was his standard practice to “monitor[] any computer IP address within a specific geographic location,” not just those “specific to US military only, or US government computers.” He did not try to isolate military service members within a geographic area. He appeared to believe that these overly broad investigations were permissible, because he was a “U.S. federal agent[]” and so could investigate violations of either the Uniform Code of Military Justice or federal law.
The extraordinary nature of the surveillance here demonstrates a need to deter future violations. So far as we can tell from the record, it has become a routine practice for the Navy to conduct surveillance of all the civilian computers in an entire state to see whether any child pornography can be found on them, and then to turn over the information to civilian law enforcement when no military connection exists.
This is squarely a case of the military undertaking the initiative to enforce civilian law against civilians. “There must be an exceptional reason” to invoke the exclusionary rule for violation of posse comitatus-like regulations, and the broad use of military surveillance of overwhelmingly civilian populations is an exceptional reason….
That a need to deter future violations exists is further supported by the government’s litigation positions. The government is arguing vehemently that the military may monitor for criminal activity all the computers anywhere in any state with a military base or installation, regardless of how likely or unlikely the computers are to be associated with a member of the military. Such an expansive reading of the military’s role in the enforcement of the civilian laws demonstrates a profound lack of regard for the important limitations on the role of the military in our civilian society….
Kleinfeld, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring ….
Were we suggesting something like application of the exclusionary rule to all Posse Comitatus violations, then application of the exclusionary rule would be inappropriate. And if there were any reason to think that the violation in this case were a fluke, it would be inappropriate. This case, though, amounts to the military acting as a national police force to investigate civilian law violations by civilians.
Generally, the exclusionary rule does not apply to Posse Comitatus violations, in the absence of “widespread and repeated violations” demonstrating a need to deter future violations.In this case, unfortunately, that is just what we have. The Navy did not just peek into Dreyer’s home computer. It peeked into every computer in the State of Washington using the peer-to-peer file sharing program, “Gnutella.” …
The military not infrequently investigates civilians or assists in civilian law enforcement incidentally to military law enforcement. A Navy shore patrol may break up a fight involving sailors at a waterfront saloon, and turn the civilians over to the local police. The Army may investigate a drug ring on base, and turn civilian spouses living on base and off- base civilian participants over to civilian authorities. There would be little reason to deter military law enforcement in cases like those, and indeed they would ordinarily not even be Posse Comitatus violations.
This case is different. There could be no bona fide military purpose to this indiscriminate peeking into civilian computers. It should be easy to distinguish this case from run of the mill military law enforcement that incidentally brings about apprehension of civilians.
True, the practical effect of the decision may be to let a criminal go. As Justice Cardozo wrote, application of the exclusionary rule means that “[t]he criminal is to go free because the constable has blundered.”
We are unlikely to see so widespread and repeated a Posse Comitatus violation from the Army or Air Force, because their military personnel would risk prison. If the military chooses to become a national police force to detect civilians committing civilian crimes, the Navy would be the branch to use, because the criminal penalty does not apply to Navy personnel. Without the criminal penalty, the exclusionary rule is about all that the judiciary has to deter such widespread and repeated Posse Comitatus violations as we have here. Letting a criminal go free to deter national military investigation of civilians is worth it.
O’Scannlain, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part ….
The exclusionary rule is “a judicially created remedy of [the Supreme Court’s] own making” whose “sole purpose” is “to deter misconduct by law enforcement.” … [E]xclusion is “our last resort, not our first impulse.” …
Despite [its] cost, application of the exclusionary rule might still be justified if there were evidence of “widespread and repeated violations” of the PCA. On this record, there is not.
The majority opinion primarily focuses on Agent Logan’s ostensible violations of the relevant regulations applying the PCA to the Navy. But the actions of one agent — no matter how egregious — do not show that violations are widespread. Agent Logan’s descriptions of his own practices are, therefore, of limited relevance.
Perhaps recognizing the thinness of this evidence, the majority opinion also points out that Agent Logan “began carrying out these searches with two other agents at least several months before he found Dreyer’s IP address.” It also references another supposed violation in Kentucky [citing a footnote omitted from the excerpt above -EV]. I fail to see how evidence that four agents committed violations — three of whom were part of the same investigative team — demonstrates a widespread problem. Such anecdotal evidence falls far short of what our precedents require before we will resort to the “extraordinary remedy” of exclusion, especially considering the cost of doing so in this case….
Finally, the majority opinion cites the government’s litigating position in this case as evidence of “a profound lack of regard for the important limitations on the role of the military in our civilian society.” Regardless of whether that observation is true, it does nothing to show that there have, in fact, been widespread and repeated violations of the PCA; it simply shows that the government wanted to win this case and put forward the best arguments it could to justify what Agent Logan did here. From the premise that the government believes it has a certain power, it does not follow that the government routinely exercises that power….
Thus, far from having “abundant evidence that the violation at issue has occurred repeatedly and frequently,” we have before us a paucity of evidence that does not come close to overcoming the “high obstacle for those urging application of the [exclusionary] rule.”

Railways extends experimental stops oftrainsPrint
Written by Avishek G Dastidar | New Delhi | Posted: September 13, 2014 3:11 am
Despite readiness on part of his ministry to do away with unnecessary stoppages of hundreds of trains, which  slow down the network, Railway Minister Sadananda Gowda has decided to defer the decision to avoid a political backlash.
On Friday, the Railways extended the stoppages indefinitely as Gowda and his team of officials decided to write letters to each MP, past and present, upon whose wishes the stoppages had been granted, explaining to each of them why these stoppages needed to be scrapped. There are over 250 such explanatory letters to be sent.
Thanks to huge revenue leakage coupled with operational constrains of the Railways caused by the 1250 ‘experimental stops’ which had been granted to trains across India following requests from MPs in the past few years, Gowda had agreed to scrap them by September 30. He had also sounded out Parliament that these stoppages would be “reviewed”.
“I will write to the MPs, while the minister will write to Union ministers, present and past, who are on the list, so that they can explain the reasons to people in their constituencies,” Devi Prasad Pande, Member Traffic, Railway Board, told The Indian Express. Sources said Gowda had taken the matter up to the PMO, which had advised him not to go ahead with the move without explaining to the MPs concerned why this decision was necessary.
In an internal costing exercise done as part of the Rail Budget, it was discovered that each additional stop was costing Railways Rs 8,000 on account of fuel and other operational costs associated with stoppages. In return, the national transporter was getting back less than Rs 500 per such stoppage on an average. The estimated revenue leakage per year is a staggering Rs 300 crore (not all trains run daily), nibbling into whatever little the cash-strapped transporter manages to earn from running the highly subsidised passenger trains.
It is this economics, besides the fact that the mammoth network slows down every time a train needs to stop unnecessarily, that the letters to the MPs would contain. The letters are said to be ready to be signed and would be dispatched immediately.

DMRC dealt with Alstom France  not UK:SreedharanPrint
E Sreedharan said that the DMRC had “nothing to do” with Alstom UK. (Reuters)
Written by Sumegha Gulati | New Delhi | Posted: September 13, 2014 3:10 am | Updated: September 13, 2014 10:43 am
While Urban development minister M Venkaiah Naidu has said the Centre will be approaching the UK government to get more details about the alleged Alstom bribery case, former Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) chief, E Sreedharan on Friday told The Indian Express that the corporation had “nothing to do” with Alstom UK.
Britain’s top investigating agency, Serious Fraud Office (SFO) on Tuesday charged the British subsidiary of Alstom — the French rail transport equipment maker — for paying bribes to DMRC officials for winning signalling contracts in phases 1 and 2 of the metro rail network here.
According to Sreedharan, during whose tenure the contracts were awarded, DMRC never did any business with Alstom’s British subsidiary. “This allegation is against Alstom Network, UK. Our contracts were with Alstom France. The two are different companies. We don’t know how our name came up in the whole matter. DMRC makes great headlines for the media, so maybe they are raking up this controversy,” he said.
On two specific cases mentioned in the charges — one, regarding disguised payments made to Singapore-based Indo European Ventures Pte Ltd and, the other made to Hong Kong-based Global King Technology Ltd, Sreedharan responded that he was not aware about the existence and activities of the two firms.
“DMRC had no connection with any such firms. I read their names for the first time a few days ago when news reports mentioned them. I am quite sure DMRC never had any dealings with these companies, nor with Alstom UK,” he added.
DMRC spokesperson Anuj Dayal said that the issue first came to light in February this year. “Since then, DMRC received no information on the allegations or any directions pertaining to these from either the ministry of urban development (MoUD) or any other agency. None of the organisations — MoUD, CBI or any other — ever approached us regarding the issue seeking a probe or assistance in the matter,” Dayal said. Officials in the MoUD confirmed that they will soon request the external affairs ministry to write to the Indian High Commission in London to approach the SFO and get relevant details.

Govt to roll out R2 lakh cr infra projects this year  saysGadkariPrint
ENS Economic Bureau | New Delhi | Posted: September 13, 2014 3:06 am
The government on Friday said it will launch infrastructure projects worth Rs 2 lakh crore in the current financial year and weed out corruption in a bid to boost the sector.
Addressing the annual convention of Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers here, road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari said, “We have cleared bottlenecks. It is easy to construct express highways but difficult to get environment clearance. However, we are removing hurdles. We have cleared projects worth Rs 1.5 lakh crore. Now this year we will launch projects worth Rs 2 lakh crore.”
He added that his ministry was also looking to build 2 lakh km of roads, including widening of existing one lakh km of highways, under the PPP mode. Gadkari also said that there is no dearth of money to finance the projects and if needed, the ministry could securitise toll revenue.

Chinas iPhone delay gives smugglers reason tosmilePrint
Reuters | Hongkong | Posted: September 13, 2014 3:04 am
The likely delayed launch of Apple Inc’s new iPhone 6 in China, the world’s biggest smartphone market, sparked a race to pre-order the phone in Hong Kong on Friday.
Pre-orders for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus sold out within two hours on Apple’s Hong Kong website — and many of those devices will be smuggled across the border into mainland China, where they could change hands for as much as four times the Hong Kong price.
The new models go on sale in the United States, Hong Kong and other markets on September 19, but China is still waiting for a release date. Hong Kong residents went online to pre-order iPhones in the hope of selling them on for a tidy profit to unofficial dealers, many of whom will then move them into China to cash in on pent-up demand there. Apple did not release the number of sales for pre-orders.
“I’m worried about getting enough iPhones to resell. Orders have doubled compared to last year,” said Gary Yiu, a salesperson at I Generation in Sin Tat Plaza in Mong Kok, Hong Kong’s electronics hub. His store offers HK$10,000 ($1,290) for those willing to re-sell the latest model, almost twice the official local price of HK$5,588. Yiu said he received more than 100 orders from Hong Kong and mainland China, double the number he had a year ago when Apple launched the iPhone 5S.
There are about 100 electronics dealers in Sin Tat Plaza and each bought 150-200 handsets immediately after the official release of the iPhone 5S last year.
In Shenzhen, across the Chinese border from Hong Kong, the asking price for the cheapest iPhone 6 model hit 20,000 yuan ($3,260), while a salesperson at a telecoms shop in Shanghai said his company had sent staff to Hong Kong, Japan and even the United States to buy the new models and get them back to China for sale.
“It’s tough to say right now what price we’ll ask. It really depends on market sentiment. It’ll be decided by the asking price in the market,” said the man surnamed Zhang.

CVC seeks power to initiate action against banks CMDs  EDsCVC seeks power to initiate action against banks CMDs, EDs

The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) has sought powers to probe corruption charges against Chairman and Managing Directors (CMDs) and Executive Directors (EDs) of public sector banks and insurance companies.
CVC has asked the finance ministry to incorporate relevant provisions in the rules to allow it to conduct disciplinary inquiries against CMDs and EDs, i.e. Whole Time Directors (WTDs) while in service and continuation of such probes after they demit office, official sources said.
The anti-corruption watchdog has also sought powers to initiate penal action against them, if they are found guilty of corruption, even after their retirement, they said.
At present, there is no rule to conduct investigation or disciplinary inquiry by the Commission against CMDs and EDs working in public sector banks, insurance companies and some financial institutions, the sources said.
The Commission examined the issue after it received complaints of alleged irregularities against some of these top executives, they said. CVC observed that the existing standard terms and conditions of appointment of WTDs i.e. board level officers of public sector banks, insurance companies etc, do not have a specific provision for initiating disciplinary action while in service, the sources said.
However, CVC can take necessary disciplinary action against board-level officers in Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs).
The standard terms and conditions of appointments provided by the Department of Public Enterprises allow initiation of disciplinary action against the board- level officers in CPSEs while they are in service, they said.
CVC has sought similar provision for WTDs of banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions by the Department of Financial Services (DFS), the sources said.
It wants adequate provision for continuation of proceedings against WTDs of banks and insurance companies under pension regulations after completion of their tenure as well as initiation of proceedings under pension regulation upto four years as is the case in the government, they said.
The matter is being discussed with the officials of DFS, the sources added. Last month, Syndicate Bank CMD SK Jain was arrested by CBI for allegedly receiving a bribe of Rs. 50 lakh to enhance credit limits of Bhushan Steel and Prakash Industries.
Besides, some officials of Oriental Bank of Commerce and Dena Bank are being probed for alleged misappropriating funds worth Rs. 436 crore from fixed deposit customers' accounts.

China fines Volkswagen affiliate $40.5 mn for price-fixingComments
An affiliate of German carmaker Volkswagen has been fined more than $40.5 million for price-fixing in China, authorities said Thursday, the latest company to be punished under a sweeping anti-monopoly crackdown.
FAW-Volkswagen Sales Company, Ltd, a partnership between the Frankfurt-based firm and Chinese auto maker FAW, has been ordered to pay 248.58 million yuan in penalties for the offence, the Hubei Province Price Bureau said in a statement.
Beijing has over the past year launched a wide-ranging crackdown on alleged malpractice by domestic and foreign firms across diverse sectors, including pharmaceuticals, baby formula and technology.
Investigations found that the Volkswagen company had since 2012 organised 10 Audi dealers in the central province to fix prices for the cars and repair services, the statement said.
The move "deprived ... downstream operators of pricing rights, inflated sales prices for the cars and auto parts, eliminated and restricted the normal competitive order of the car and the spare parts (market) and damaged the rights and interests of consumers", it said.
"FAW-Volkswagen Sales Company, Ltd. presided over the process of organising, reaching and implementing the price monopoly agreement of the car and repair services and obviously played a leading and facilitating role," it added.
The fine was equivalent to 6% of the company's relevant sales revenue in the previous year, according to the statement. Eight of the 10 dealers were fined between 110,000 yuan and 16.06 million yuan while the other two were exempted for reporting about the violation or minor offences, it said.
The sales company and the dealers lowered the price of imported Audi parts on August 1 and promised to "strictly comply with" Chinese anti-monopoly laws, according to the statement.
Separately, state media reported that Chrysler (China) Automobile Sales Co will pay up to 31.7 million yuan in an antitrust fine imposed by Shanghai authorities for requiring dealers between 2012 and 2014 to maintain prices recommended by the manufacturer.
The official Xinhua news agency also reported that Shanghai pricing authorities said three of the company's dealerships in Shanghai would be slapped with antitrust fines totalling 2.14 million yuan for agreeing to set unified prices for car repair, spare parts and paint jobs for Chrysler, Jeep and Dodge vehicles.
The National Development and Reform Commission, one of three Chinese government bodies that investigates monopoly actions, said last month it was probing auto firms including Audi and Chrysler as well as 12 Japanese companies for possible violations.
It is the latest in a series of inquiries in various fields which have raised investor concerns about the business climate in China.
The government last month fined 10 of the Japanese auto parts firms more than $200 million in total for price-fixing, reportedly the biggest-ever such penalties, with one of the companies ordered to pay the highest amount of 290.4 million yuan.

Prices may get capped in $1,260-70 range and decline
September 11, 2014:  
Comex gold futures were sharply lower on Thursday as the dollar strengthened against a basket of currencies. Market fears of an earlier-than-expected hike in interest rates by Federal Reserve continues to grow higher ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee meet next week.
Demand for gold as hedge against geo-political risk was also curbed after Ukraine’s President said that Russia had removed bulk of its forces from his country, raising hopes of peace. Physical demand is expected to pick up ahead of Diwali which could support prices at lower levels. Comex gold futures have fallen in line with our expectations.
As mentioned in the previous update, we expected prices to test resistances in the $1,280 range and then decline. A fall below the $1,263-65 zone has opened the downside for gold futures now towards $1,240-45 levels initially, where it can find some support in the near-term.
Prices have tested the crucial near-term support at $1,240. Though possibility of a support looks likely from here, we think prices could eventually break lower and head towards recent lows at $1,180 levels. Resistances will now be seen at $1,260-65 followed by $1,275-80 levels. Only a close above $1,297 could cause doubts on our bearish view. Such a rise could take prices higher towards $1,310-15 again, which we do not favour now. Favoured view still expects prices to get capped in the $1,260-70 range and decline again.
We will now go with the alternative wave counts that we have considered broadly in our earlier updates.
From the peak of $1,920 a corrective decline in the form of “A-B-C” is already over at $1,181 and a new impulse has begun. Confirmation of such an impulse will be seen above $1,445. Fall below $1,250 could now force us to abandon this scenario and look at a bearish one targeting $1,050.
RSI is in the oversold zone now indicating a possible upward correction in the offing. The averages in MACD are below the zero line of the indicator indicating a bearish reversal.
Only a cross over again above the zero line could hint at a possible bullish reversal again. Therefore, look to sell gold on rallies to $1,260-65 zone with a stop loss at $1,280 targeting $1,225 and 1,200.
Supports are at $1,225, 1,200 and 1,175 and Resistances are at $1,260, 1,285 and 1,297.

Clean power can bring $100 bn in 4 yrs: GoyalComments
Union power minister Piyush Goyal on Thursday said that India’s renewable energy sector will be able to attract investments worth $100 billion ( Rs. 6 lakh crore) over the next 3-4 years and assured government support to domestic solar equipment makers.
Goyal, who was speaking at The Economist India Summit, said the government was committed to safeguard the interest of domestic manufacturers of solar panels and would come  up with a five-year plan for this.
He said the government will help domestic manufacturers to fulfil their current manufacturing potential and meet expansion plans.
Regarding the anti-dumping duty issue Goyal said, “I am happy that the issue of anti-dumping has been resolved. The commerce ministry was informed by domestic manufacturers that they have withdrawn their plea for an anti-dumping duty on solar panels.”
Goyal said the it was a legacy issue that could have increased costs and been detrimental to the government’s solar mission. “All the stake holders, after withdrawing the demand for anti-dumping duty on solar panels, held a meeting and have discussed the way to take forward solar mission,” said Goyal. “The duty would have killed the solar mission.” The Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission, introduced in 2011, aims to have solar capacity of 20,000 MW by 2022.
The imposition of an anti-dumping duty on solar panels was recommended by the UPA government in May 2014. It imposed a duty in the range of $0.11-0.81 per watt on solar cells imported from the US, China, Malaysia and Chinese Taipei. The US dragged India to the WTO on domestic sourcing norms for the national solar mission.
Goyal also said the NDA government was committed to support research and development initiatives in the renewable energy sector. “A Rs. 200-crore pilot project to examine the potential of solar and thermal power with IIT Jodhpur has been approved,” the minister said.

GST set to be rolled out by April 2016GST set to be rolled out by April 2016
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, September 11, 2014
First Published: 23:05 IST(11/9/2014) | Last Updated: 01:47 IST(12/9/2014)
Comments
India’s biggest tax reform initiative — Goods and Services Tax (GST) — has entered the final leg of implementation with the government planning to announce a roadmap to roll out the new indirect tax regime by April 2016.
The Centre and states are believed to have agreed on a broad consensus on the issue of revenue losses with a Rs. 35,000-crore compensation plan spread over three years for reimbursing states after phasing out the central sales tax (CST), sources said.
The government has gradually brought down the level of central sales tax (CST) — a proportion of which go to the states — over the last few years from 4% to 2% as a precursor to rolling out GST.
As an interim measures, the government has also periodically compensated states for revenue losses.
The Central government had disbursed Rs. 6,000 crore in 2011 and another Rs. 9,000 crore had been provided for in 2013, but the states have been claiming compensation for 2011-12, 2012-13, and now 2013-14.
The first tranche — Rs. 14,000 crore — of the CST compensation plan is likely to be paid in 2014-15, with the balance over the next two years, sources said.
If adopted, GST can alter tax administration by giving a one-shot solution to a welter of levies such as excise, value added tax and octroi and stitch together a common national market.
Under the system, the Centre and states will tax goods and services in identical rates. For instance, if 20% is the agreed rate on a certain good, the Centre and states will collect 10% each.
The Centre plans to introduce the Constitution Amendment Bill in the Winter Session of Parliament in December. States also want an independent compensation mechanism to be incorporated in the Constitution Amendment Bill and are also seeking for petroleum and liquor to be kept outside the ambit of GST.
Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa on Thursday wrote to finance minister Arun Jaitley  on this. “The proposal to bring petro products under GST is another area of concern, which would seriously diminish the limited revenue resources of the states,” Jayalalithaa said.
GST’s implementation has faced political hurdles since state governments feel it would rob them of discretionary fiscal powers and affect earnings.
Maharashtra, for example, earns more than Rs. 13,000 crore annually from octroi.
Gujarat, on the other hand, a highly industrialised state, earns about Rs. 5,000 crore from its share from the CST.
Each of these states fear that they will lose these revenues once these levies get subsumed under GST.
The Centre is hoping that a robust country-wide IT network and infrastructure to make the implementation seamless across state boundaries will be ready by April 2016.

Chennai, Sept 12:  
Those who have received allotment of Snowman Logistics in the public issue must be sitting happy as the shares listed with a huge premium of 70 per cent over the IPO price.
Equity shares of Snowman Logistics, a subsidiary of Gateway Distriparks, opened the first day of trading at Rs 76, and is currently ruling at Rs 79.80, against the issue price of Rs 47.
The appetite seems to be not ending as there were only buy orders of 34.07 lakh shares on the NSE, with no sellers available; a little over 15 lakh shares were pending on the BSE..
The issue had received strong response from investors, at an over subscription of 60 times.
The company had raised Rs 44.4 crore from three anchor investors, ahead of its initial public offering. The anchor investors are IDFC, ICICI Prudential and Faering Capital.
The largest cold chain solutions provider raised Rs 197.4 crore through the issue. The amount will be used for setting up new temperature controlled and ambient warehouses, and for long-term working capital.
Gateway Distriparks, which holds 40 per cent stake in Snowman, was quoting at Rs 273.10, up Rs 3.60, or 1.34 per cent after hitting a 52-week high of Rs 278.90.

Mumbai, Sept 12:  
The Sensex and the Nifty ended the session marginally in the green amid mixed European cues. Investors remained cautious ahead of CPI inflation data due to be released today.
The 30-share BSE index Sensex was up 65.17 points at 27,061.04 and the 50-share NSE index Nifty was up 19.8 points at 8,105.50.
Among BSE sectoral indices, healthcare, consumer durables and auto indices were the star-performers and were up 0.74 per cent, 0.72 per cent and 0.64 per cent, respectively. On the other hand, power index fell the most by 1.29 per cent, followed by capital goods 0.81 per cent, realty 0.36 per cent and metal 0.21 per cent.
Cipla, Maruti, Bharti Airtel, ITC and SSLT were the major Sensex gainers, while the major losers were Hindalco, Sun Pharma, Tata Power, NTPC and L&T.
European shares inched higher early on Friday but remained in a tight range, as investors refrained from taking strong bets on indexes ahead of Scotland's referendum and the US Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week.
Investors awaited a meeting of euro-area finance ministers and data on US retail sales and consumer sentiment for clues about the outlook for stimulus and interest rates.
With just a week to go before Scots vote in a referendum on independence, a YouGov poll for The Times and Sun newspapers showed on Friday Scottish support for the union at 52 per cent versus support for independence at 48 per cent, excluding those who said they did not know how they would vote
Asian shares outside Japan fell as investors fretted that even the hint of a shift in Fed policy might spark a withdrawal of funds from emerging markets. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.3 per cent at one-month lows.
While there was little in the way of major data due in Asia, figures on US retail sales due later Friday could fuel speculation over US rates. Economists expect a solid rebound of 0.6 percent in August, up from a disappointingly flat reading in July and fuelled by a boom in auto sales.
A strong result would only add to speculation the Fed might refine, or even drop, its commitment to keeping rates low for a "considerable time" after its asset purchase programme ends.

New iPhone 6 Plus shipments to be delayedMany customers will have to wait three to four weeks to get their hands on Apple Inc's larger screen iPhone 6 Plus after pre-orders for Sept. 19 delivery were booked out within hours
ET SPECIAL:
ET Special: All you want to know about Apple iPhone 6
Customers may have to wait three to four weeks to get their hands on Apple Inc's iPhone 6 Plus, after a record number of orders for the company's latest smartphones strained available supply.
The new iPhone 6 goes on sale on Sept. 19 in the United States but the company began taking online orders on Thursday. While the larger 5.5-inch "Plus" models now display a wait time of up to a month, the 4.7-inch version remains available for delivery on September 19, Apple's website showed.
Verizon Wireless , AT&T and Sprint Corp , also showed shipment delays of up to six weeks on their respective websites. Apple said the pace of orders has so far outstripped any of its previous iPhones.
"Response to iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus has been incredible, with a record number of pre-orders overnight. Pre-orders are currently available online or through the Apple Store App," spokeswoman Trudy Muller said.
Apple routinely grapples with iPhone supply constraints, particularly in years that involve a smartphone re-design. The latest iPhones come with larger screens and some analysts had anticipated that production issues may keep a lid on initial runs.
Its suppliers had scrambled to get enough screens ready because the need to redesign a key component had disrupted panel production, supply chain sources told Reuters last month.
It was unclear whether the hiccup could limit the number of phones available to consumers, the sources said at the time. Apple declined to comment on supply chain issues.
In addition, Chinese customers may also have to wait until the year-end before they can buy the iPhone 6. Apple is yet to set a release date for China, the world's biggest smartphone market.
The company unveiled its latest iPhones along with a watch and a mobile payments service on Tuesday.
AT&T's chief executive of mobile and business, Ralph de la Vega, told investors at a conference in New York that iPhone 6 orders have so far surpassed orders last year and the year before.
"It is such a great thing to wake up in the morning to know that you have hundreds of thousands of orders already before you even have a cup of coffee," said the executive.
Apple's iPhones tend to incite the kind of initial buying frenzy unknown to many other brands, partly because of the company's well-honed marketing tactics.
On secondary markets online, the rights to a pre-ordered iPhone 6 Plus are worth as much as double the unsubsidized sticker price. One eBay auction for an unlocked 128-gigabyte gold version of the 5.5-inch phone, for example, was bidding at $1,625 on Friday afternoon, compared with a face value of $949.
One post on the New York City edition of Craigslist sought $10,000 the privilege to "be one of the first & few people to own this model and before the rest of the world."
New iPhones tend to get listed at stratospheric prices on various online retail sites from the United States to China, on the assumption that there's big demand from people who must get their hands on the phone from day one. That in turns fuels a grey market of dealers who buy in bulk for resale.

Apple CEO Tim Cook and his Moment of Open Culturereddit
At Apple's most recent product launch in Cupertino -- where Apple Watch , Apple Pay and iPhone 6 (oh, and iPhone 6 Gigantic) were flaunted about like the Halloween parade I took part in at my elementary school every October as a child -- a wonderful culture moment took place on stage.
No it wasn't what the Internet is referring to as Apple Scarf Guy . (Although according to Zara, male scarves are now sold out, literally, across the planet.)
And
no, it wasn't those three Irish lads from Dublin (and an Englishman) showing up on that same stage (clad in leather looking like a biker gang from Holland) singing something about Joey Ramone. They even managed to give away their new album for free via iTunes to over 17 billion people. (I may have rounded up.)
That did give me an idea to give away my next book -- for free -- via Amazon. After checking in with Amazon though, they informed me I'd have to wear leather pants and a scarf for a year, so that's out, for now.
The culture moment I'm referring to involves Tim Cook, Apple CEO.
For fashionistas out there, I'm sorry to disappoint, but it has nothing to do with Tim's decision to un-tuck his shirt either. I must admit, I wondered to myself if ex- Burberry CEO Angel Ahrendts -- now Apple's lead on all things retail and online stores -- might have whispered into his ear just before show time, "Tim, un-tuck that shirt or I'm jumping ship to JC Penney or Target or Sears or any other retailer that is imploding ."
No, Tim's culture moment was simple yet profound.
He recognized his team in a public forum.
You probably will stop reading now. After all, what does employee recognition have to do with culture let alone knowing when the next full moonrise is about to occur? (Oh the pending charm of Apple Watch)
Once
the three product launches concluded on stage, Tim paused ever so slightly, and what seemed unscripted (at least I hope it was unscripted) he asked all Apple employees present in the auditorium to rise up from their seats.
With a round of applause initiated by Tim, he thanked everyone for their hard work, their creativity and their commitment to the launch and everything leading up to the day.
This is one of the most important traits a leader -- let alone the CEO of the world's most famous fruit company -- can demonstrate and act upon. Failing to recognize your employees is akin to eating sushi without soy sauce and chopsticks. When Tim took a brief moment to say thanks in front of that auditorium -- and in front of the 23.4 billion people tuned into the live stream -- he said to me, "My leadership style is inclusive, timely and one that supports recognition of the employee. The culture at Apple is becoming one that is open."
After a dizzying display of jumps and high kicks by U2 front-man Bono concluded (wait, wrong decade - it's not 1985) and the somewhat awkward announcement of a free U2 album, Tim stood alone in my mind. I've been publicly critical of Steve Jobs in the past, regarding his alleged and documented bouts of bullying and various "leader of people" malpractices at Apple.
When Mr. Cook decided to publicly recognize the Apple team and their performance -- when he demonstrated his moment of open culture -- he became more than a CEO.
He became a Chief Engagement Officer too.
(And for what it's worth, I really like the song 'Every Breaking Heart' from the free U2 album. Don't judge.)

4 stocks up 100% could rise more in 20144 stocks up 100% could rise more in 2014

Investors love a stock that soars 100% — unless they don’t own it. But there are some stocks on amazing runs that might still have a few seats left.
There are four stocks in the broad Standard & Poor’s 1500 index, including ethanol seller Green Plains (GPRE) , electronics chipmaker RF Micro Devices (RFMD) and security firm VASCO Data (VDSI) that are not only up 100% or more this year, but analysts see the stocks headed higher, still, over the next 18 months, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from S&P Capital IQ.
But there’s no question that most of the big gains appear behind these stocks. On average, analysts see the stocks rising 8.8% from their current levels. That’s a decent increase, but nowhere near their average 130% gains this year so far. The fact there are so few of these massive winners with more fuel is just another piece of evidence of just how tired this bull market is getting.
The highest-flying stock with the most upside, at least according to analysts, is Green Plains. The stock is up 114% this year and analysts see another 15% upside.
And there’s no secret as to why. Analysts are calling for the company to earn $3.87 a share in 2014, which if comes true, would be an increase of 207%. The company has beaten expectations in four of the past five quarters, so it’s not a ridiculous idea.
And then there’s RF Micro Devices, which makes radio devices uses in mobile digital gadgets. The stock is up 136% this year and analysts are calling for another 11% upside. Again, it’s all about earnings expectations. Analysts are calling for the company to earn $1.01 a share this year, up 119% from 2013.
Again, it might be a bit alarming to see so few of the moonshots blowing past the targets. For instance, shares of aluminum seller Century Aluminum (CENX) are up 163% this year. That’s the good news, the bad news is that analysts’ targets are calling for a 8% decline over the next 18 months.
Looks like even for these stocks, once you have such a big run, it’s all that much harder to do it again.

The Faults in OurStarsWritten by Pratik Kanjilal | Posted: September 13, 2014 3:42 am
Book: And Then One Day
Author: Naseeruddin Shah
Pages: 272
Price: Rs 699
At the rather advanced age of 64, Naseeruddin Shah has turned writer. A rattling, banging good writer, and some of the dramatis personae in his autobiography, And then One Day, could be rattled enough to reach for the mind-altering substances or sharp instruments, according to taste. The title of the book is from Dark Side of the Moon, the story is all about drugs, sex and acting, with much bohemianism, some adolescent gunplay and a stabbing thrown in — Shah was literally stabbed in the back by a close friend who was too blown to know better. Fortunately, he was too blown to stab better, too. There is also a bizarre interlude in the Polish woods with the celebrated Jerzy Grotowski, who emerges as the Jim Jones of experimental theatre.
Throughout, Shah’s voice rings true. This account, far too strange to be fiction, is the joyful mea culpa of a young actor who believed that he should not be cast because he looked like Alfred E Neuman. Also, because he “was trouble, unreasonable, opinionated, hot-headed, and a dope-smoker”. At the Film and Television Institute of India, he took “huge doses of Dexedrine to trip and then Mandrax to sleep”. That’s just this side of speedball hell.
Shah’s blistering honesty is a refreshing improvement on the state of the craft of autobiography, plastic surgery performed on personal history to remove every last blemish and prepare the sad, dead thing that remains for canonisation. Shah’s story is all warts. He finds a wild beauty in the very embarrassments that autobiographers conceal — failure, inhumanity, self-destruction. And Then One Day, the first readable autobiography I have seen in years, is like a mouth-freshener after the indigestion of the last big title on the market — K Natwar Singh’s One Life is Not Enough, a CV tarted up to resemble a literary work. The big one of 2014, Hillary Rodham Clinton’s Hard Choices, was much more real. But just how unwary and unclever can you be when you’re president-in-waiting?
Honesty is a beautiful thing, but, as with the atom, the collateral damage can be awesome. Rarely has the creative community been so lovingly, respectfully, taken apart. “Mr [Alyque] Padamsee… had a secretary called Miss Pope, the better I suppose to savour the appellation ‘God’ by which he was referred to…” “[Junoon] appears like an acting contest and the only one who emerges with any laurels at all is a non-actor in a tiny part, Ismat Chughtai… and that’s because she’s the only one of us not trying to act everyone else under the table.” “[Ebrahim Alkazi’s] reputation rested chiefly on his impeccable productions in which the opening lights coming up on an elaborate empty setting could garner applause, but in which the acting was somewhat soulless…” “The producer of [Sparsh], Basu Bhattacharya, could have done with some sensitivity himself.” “Peter [Brook] was… intent on mythologising himself and had not only never bothered to learn how continued…

Govt fails to plug Jhelum breaches  residents forced to rough itacrossPrint
Written by Mir Ehsan | Srinagar | Posted: September 13, 2014 3:39 am
More than 10 breaches in the embankment of the Jhelum river within a span of 10 hours have caused devastation in Srinagar, yet even after six days the government has failed to plug these breaches, causing water stagnation within the city.
These breaches have left the city’s business centre, Lal Chowk, and the posh localities of Rajbagh, Jawahar Nagar, Tulsi Bagh, Indira Nagar and Shivpora completely submerged. Though the water in the river has started to recede, it continues to flow into residential areas, submerging some houses under nearly 15 feet of water.
The breaches in the embankment at Abi Guzar and Kursoo areas on Sunday morning have left the large residential areas inundated, with water levels in some parts rising up to 30 feet.
“This breach is still open. Nobody from the government has bothered to visit this place,” says Javid Ahmad, a local volunteer at Kursoo Rajbagh. “There are three more breaches within a 1 km radius from where water is still flowing into the city.” he adds.
To cross these breaches in the absence of any government machinery, local volunteers have set up wooden poles, poplar trees and ropes.
“It is very dangerous to cross these breaches. But people are taking the risk so they can reach Jawahar Nagar, Solina and other parts of the city…I will also try to cross as I have to find my uncle’s family, whose house has been submerged,” says Arshid Ahmad who has travelled here from the old city.
Even women who have given birth during the floods in the Lal Ded hospital have been crossing these breaches along with infants.
Even civilian relief volunteers and rescue teams are being forced to use these routes to reach flood-affected victims as there are no boats available.
“We are trying to reach flood-affected victims by crossing the breakaway portion of the river bund. We have to reach the victims with relief,” says Ejaz Ahmad, a relief worker who has travelled here from Central Kashmir’s Char e Sharief town.
A senior official in the Flood Control and Irrigation Department said that plugging of leakages in the river is the first job that has to be undertaken. However, he adds that since everybody, including his employees, have suffered, it will take time to plug these leakages.

Noida: Preferred destination for new realtyprojectsPosted: September 13, 2014 3:38 am
By: Santhosh Kumar
There is increased buoyancy in the market after the arrival of the new government, especially after the Budget has set the ball rolling for the real estate sector. With allocation of more funds for affordable housing, easing of FDI norms, implementation of REITs and special focus on infrastructure development, the government has made it clear that in order to push economic growth, a special focus on infrastructure and real estate development is pivotal. In the foreseeable future, the real estate market in Delhi NCR is going to see considerable forward momentum.
As land is a prerequisite for any kind of development, Noida and Gurgaon are the logical answers to the burgeoning need for housing in Delhi NCR. In terms of inventory, Noida and Gurgaon have more options than any other city in the NCR. These two areas are consequently expanding and growing, and expansion opens opportunities for further growth in real estate. It is for this reason that these two cities now have mature real estate markets for different sets of buyers and investors.
However, they have very individual returns potential. In the last few years, it appears that investments made into properties located in Gurgaon have reaped better returns than those secured from properties in Noida. However, Noida is not lagging very far behind. Various recent announcements and the infrastructure uplifts of the city have made Noida’s real estate market increasingly attractive.
What favours investors entering Noida is the lower pricing factor, which now promises better appreciation and returns on investments. The realty market in Gurgaon has now crystallised into one most favourable for buyers in the premium segment. But the other side of the coin is that the high price points in Gurgaon suggest that properties there will no longer fetch high rates of appreciation.
With the fast-paced development in infrastructure in Noida and its vicinity, real estate growth has really picked up over the past few years. There have been announcements for many new such projects as well, which has had a positive effect on the real estate market.
The proposed extension of the Dwarka-Noida City Center to Pari Chowk will give direct connectivity to Delhi and other NCR areas, and the project is expected to complete by 2021. The Noida Metro Rail Corporation (NMRC) has got the required approvals for the 29 km-long Noida-Greater Noida Metro link from the state government, as well. Simultaneously, the Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA) has plans to set up its own power plant, which will provide uninterrupted power supply to the region. Though Noida is known for its affordable housing projects, there are numerous luxury projects underway as well as in the pipeline in Noida and its adjoining areas. Renowned developers like Supertech, 3C Company, Prateek Group, Lotus Greens and Wave Infratech have launched super-luxury projects with 3-5 BHK apartments of 2,000-4,000 sq ft and priced in the range of Rs 1 crore to 3 crore.
With good infrastructure, metro connectivity and good road network, real estate development in the Noida regions is picking continued…

High hopes this festivalseasonWhile developers expect sales to grow, buyers should take a hard-nosed look before making a decision.
Written by Anshumali Pravinchandra Ruparel | Posted: September 13, 2014 3:37 am
Festival season 2014 is different for the real estate sector as developers are betting on the renewed market sentiment coupled with tradition to see their sales counters abuzz with activity.
Last year, the season, which begins with Ganesh Chathurthi and lasts until Diwali saw less than a 13 per cent year-on-year increase in sales. This time though, the festivities are following in quick succession. To add to that is the general optimism generated by the Budget pronouncements.
“This year, the festival season is well timed in terms of policy decisions by the Central and state governments, thereby impacting sentiments positively. This may be a catalyst for some end-users to reconsider their purchase decisions. There is widespread optimism this time, marking a turning point,” says Sachin Deodhar, president, sales and marketing at Rustomjee, a leading developer in Mumbai.
“The festive season is considered a peak time by developers, since 25-35 per cent of their annual sales happen in this relatively short period,” says Ramesh Nair, COO – Business & National Director, JLL India. As always, developers have lined up various offers to sweeten the deal for buyers.
Offers galore
In the Mumbai region, the once popular 20: 80 payment scheme is making a comeback. Here, the buyer pays 20 per cent of the cost as down payment at the time of booking and the rest 80 per cent is paid at the time of possession. This time, however, there is a difference. After the RBI notification on such schemes, the balance 80 per cent is no more linked with bank loans and the payment as per the stage of construction is no more implemented. So, the buyer gets couple of years to arrange for the funds without EMIs in most of the cases as the advertisements say “No EMIs till possession”.
In other markets, developers have packaged offers very innovatively. One developer has gone a step further and announced the finance scheme of 8: 92. While, one cannot say if it is a competition or desperation, another developer has declared “A free Hyundai-i10 car with every booking” and also “a lucky draw to win a Mercedes Benz”. Gold vouchers are also being offered by some.
There are also a few deals that offer “cash discounts” and “special price”. Some developers have announced “no service tax and no VAT” or in another variant “no stamp duty and registration”. These are the offers that one should consider which aims at reduction in base price or overall cost of buying. “Offers given can range from the very attractive to the downright meaningless. Freebies such as household goods, electronic items, automobiles and foreign vacations are generally announced. The offers that make the most sense are those add real value from the home purchase perspective, and would include waiver of stamp duty continued…

Flyover engineers held for Bangalore crash that killedtwoPrint
Written by Santosh Kumar R B | Bangalore | Posted: September 13, 2014 3:34 am
The Bangalore traffic police on Friday arrested two engineers of the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) for the death of two persons in a traffic accident on a flyover on the Outer Ring Road last week.
The BDA engineers who were involved in the construction of the flyover have been charged with negligence for not installing proper signages on the flyover despite it being under construction.
On September 3, a taxi driver crashed his vehicle on the flyover, leading to his death and that of his passenger — a software engineer who was heading towards the airport with his wife.
The airport traffic police who investigated the case arrested the two BDA engineers on Friday.
The DCP of traffic (East division) M N Babu Rajendra Prasad said that the arrested persons were Sripadaraj, an Assistant Executive Engineer and Pradeep, an Assistant Engineer. A third person from the BDA was also arrested and was identifed as the project in-charge Vinobha.
The traffic DCP said that the work on the flyover at Devarabeesanahalli had been in progress for a few years but the project remained incomplete. The BDA, meanwhile, had not put up any sign boards to caution people about hazards while using the road.
“We requested the BDA in May to install signages and warned of criminal action if any thing were to go wrong. They ignored our letter and warnings,” Prasad said.
The police had initially registered a case of negligence against the taxi driver but further investigations revealed that the negligence of BDA officials was also responsibile for the accident.

Dy-no-mite! Good Times Restaurants rollsDy-no-mite! Let the Good Times roll

Cast from CBS’ ’70s hit Good Times.
Good Times Restaurants  GTIM   surged 25% to $4.96 Thursday  on two bullish recommendations by stock analysts.
Colorado-based Good Times got a buy rating and a $7.50 price target from Roth Capital Partner’s  Tony Breener, while  another new fan, Craig-Hallum Capital Group senior research analyst Alex Fuhrman,  set a $10 price target.
The 27-year-old  fast food chain operates  36 restaurants, mostly in Colorado. August  same store sales rose 12%, and CEO Boyd Hoback expects double-digit gains  for the fiscal fourth-quarter. For the latest quarter ended June 30, revenue rose 16.7% – the 16th straight quarter of increasing same-store sales.
With Colorado’s strong economic and tourism boom following the legalization of marijuana, Good Times is a “Colorado pure play” with two “high-quality, high-growth” restaurant concepts, Fuhrman says in a Thursday research report.
Furhman suggests his  $10 price target may be conservative, given menu changes, store expansion and  the pot-fueled growth in Colorado tourism.
“A robust franchising pipeline could drive sales with other high-quality (quick-service) restaurants, potentially making GTIM a $20 stock,” based on 2016 sales projections.
Good Times recently entered a development deal to build Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar restaurants to compete in the fast-casual dining market, currently dominated by Chipotle, Noodles and Five Guys. The company plans to open its third Bad Daddy’s in Colorado this fall and up to eight more in 2015.
Good Times has already provided great returns for investors in 2014. Shares  are up 89 % year-to-date.

Managers  Stress and Their Relationships With Employees: Lessons From Norwayreddit
Many studies in recent years show the connections between positive, collaborative relationships at work; a positive, supportive management culture; and higher levels of creative, productive work. I think the findings of this recent study from Norway of 3000 managers, conducted by researchers at BI Norwegian Business School, add to this knowledge, and are relevant both to managers and those being managed here in the U.S.
The study examined stress among mangers, and found, In essence, that managers who enjoy a positive relationship with their employees suffer less dangerous stress at work. "The best thing a manager can do to prevent work stress is to develop good relationships with the employees at work," concluded lead researcher Astrid M. Richardsen in a summary of the findings .
The research found that more than six out of ten Norwegian managers (61.8 per cent) indicate that they often or all the time experience time pressure or a heavy workload. Fewer than five per cent say they rarely or never have time pressure at work. Most relevant to U.S. organizations is the finding that managers experience significantly less stress when they feel they have a good relationship to their employees, and the employees show a positive conduct and confidence in their managers. That is, according to the research summary , when the employees are happy with what the manager does, understand his or her challenges and participate actively in solving the problems, the manager will have less stress. This will probably be because the manager trusts the employees more and delegates more tasks to them. Hence the work pressure will decrease, Richardsen believes.
Although differences exist between managers and workers in Norway and the U.S. culture regarding work-life stress and organizational pressures, one commonality is the Norwegian finding that managers who feel they have control of their work situation and great freedom to make decisions experience less work pressure and emotional strain. They also suffer considerably less role stress than managers who do not have such control. Most U.S. managers would resonate with that, as well as with the finding that managers who suffer work-related stress factors may develop frustration, irritation and anger, reduced self-confidence and depression. That might lead to lower concentration, reduced motivation and work satisfaction, and a low work effort and performance. And, such stress can impact the organization in such ways as reduced productivity and a poorer bottom line result.
Four Common Stress Factors
The Norwegian study looked at four stress factors , also relevant to managers in the U.S.: 1) Time pressures and workload, 2) Emotional strain, 3) Role conflict between the demands from the top management and from the employees) and 4) Role conflict between work and private life. Researchers identified these stress sources as the most significant:
• The job itself (e.g. the work requirements facing the manager).
• The manager's own reactions to a specific job situation (e.g. anxiety for how people will respond, a feeling of fatigue or exhaustion).
• How one handles work tasks that are challenging or straining (e.g. works harder, works overtime, takes work home).
• Any conflict between the demands at work and family considerations / leisure activities.
The researchers suggested several ways managers can help manage their stress, more generally, in addition to their primary finding that positive relationships with their workers is most significant.
I think that key link between managers' stress and their relationships with employees highlights a growing awareness of and need for management practices grounded in principles of empathic, supportive relationships; learning and growth-oriented opportunities; and fair treatment of employees at all levels.

A Plea for Taking Advertising Seriouslyreddit
If had a dime for every time I've heard someone say, "Oh, I don't pay any attention to ads.  I don't let them affect me," I'd be very rich indeed.
Truth be told, ads do affect us -- and often in ways that we never even stop to think about.  Ads aren't just selling messages about this or that product or service, they also convey a whole host of social and cultural information that comes along with the selling promotion at no extra cost.
Take, for example, an orange juice ad.  How might it look?  It very well might be on a breakfast table with a family sitting around in their kitchen having breakfast.  One thing is for sure -- it wouldn't just be a naked glass of orange just sitting there on its own.  Rather, the ad would place the orange juice in its context of use, showing how it fits into our lives in some way.
And in, let's say, that hypothetical orange juice ad we see what the family looks like, what kind of clothes they are wearing, what the interior of their house looks like, as well as whose job it is to prepare and serve the breakfast and who just gets to sit and eat it.
I've been teaching about advertising and society at Duke University since the 1970s and used this example time and again in my lectures. Then I stop and ask the class some questions:  What's the family look like? Almost always: mom, dad, 2 kids.  Boys, girls?  One of each.  Which one is older? The boy.  Who's serving the breakfast?   The mom.  What's the family's ethnicity? Almost always: white, although in recent years answers have become a bit more variable with white still winning out by a lot.
Then I pose the real question.  How come there is so much agreement among us about the answers to these questions?  This exercise is a way of demonstrating the fundamental way that advertising, willy-nilly, teaches us not only about products, services, and brands but perhaps just as importantly about values, gender roles, how to live in society, what our houses should look like, and a whole host of other social and cultural information.
Not influenced by ads? Think again. You may be able to resist buying Brand X but how good are you and I at parrying these other lessons?  Let's face it, we are exposed to thousands of advertising images every day and their afterimages linger on with us and help shape not only our selves but our society and culture.
To say you aren't influenced by ads is to abdicate any responsibility for managing what we get taught beyond the selling message.
I remember hearing some years ago about a TV talk show in France that featured a panel of professors, writers, journalists, and lay people who would for a half-hour every Sunday discuss and critique an ad from the previous week.  Talk about taking ads seriously!  And perhaps the more amazing thing is that the program was very popular, or so the story goes.
I can't vouch for any of this from personal experience but I love the story.  I just wish we had a place in our public culture where we could do the same.  The one time when we come close -- the commentary on Super Bowl commercials -- produces such inane sound bite statements that it's actually worse than nothing at all.  That is not ad critiquing, it's a popularity context.
I think it's high time that we stop saying we aren't influenced by ads and ask instead about the influences that advertising imagery (and other popular cultural media, movies, TV shows, and so on) have on us.
Fortunately, the technologies of the modern age offer us some unprecedented ways to do this.  I hope you will take a moment and post your ideas about how we might begin that public discussion about how we, as citizens and consumers, can stop ignoring advertising and begin treating it seriously.

European Union delays Ukraine free trade dealEuropean Union
(The move appears to be at…)
BRUSSELS: The European Union, Russia and Ukraine agreed on Friday to delay the implementation of an EU-Ukraine free trade pact until the end of next year, EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht said.
Ukraine will continue to enjoy privileged access to the EU market until that date, he said, but it will not have to cut duties on imports from the EU in return.
The move appears to be at least partly a concession to Russia, which fears the EU-Ukraine agreement will harm its industry.
It has been urging the EU to refrain from implementing the free-trade pact with Ukraine until its concerns over the agreement are addressed.
The EU-Ukraine free trade pact is the centrepiece of a wide-ranging political and trade agreement which has been at the heart of Ukraine's political crisis over the last year.
Moscow had threatened to introduce import tariffs on Ukrainian goods if Kiev went ahead with the planned trade agreement from Nov. 1.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had also asked the EU to consider allowing Kiev to delay reducing customs duty on EU exports coming into the Ukraine under the new pact, Interfax Ukraine news agency reported.
Allowing EU products more cheaply into the Ukraine market could initially create problems for the weak economy there.
"We will delay the provisional application of the (free trade agreement) until Dec. 31 of next year," De Gucht told a news conference after talks with Russian Economy Minister Alexei Ulyukayev and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin.
The EU will extend temporary tariff cuts it granted to Ukrainian products earlier this year until the end of next year, De Gucht said.
"The reason we are doing this .. is the very difficult economic situation in Ukraine," he said.
"This is part and parcel of a comprehensive peace process in Ukraine," he added.
The move also created a breathing space of 15 months in which Russia, Ukraine and the EU would continue talks to try to meet Russian concerns over the EU-Ukraine trade pact, he said.
Under the agreement, Russia and Ukraine will continue to apply preferential trade treatment to each other's products under a free trade agreement among countries of the Moscow-dominated Commonwealth of Independent States.
Russian news agencies quoted Ulyukayev as saying earlier on Friday that Russia would introduce import tariffs on Ukrainian goods from Nov. 1 if Kiev went ahead with the trade pact with the EU.

By-elections to 33 assembly  3 Lok Sabha seats today; spotlight on UPBypolls for 33 assembly, 3 Lok Sabha seats today; spotlight on UP
Saubhadra Chatterji , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, September 12, 2014
First Published: 17:28 IST(12/9/2014) | Last Updated: 04:03 IST(13/9/2014)
Comments
The results of Saturday’s by-elections for three Lok Sabha and 33 assembly seats may not alter any ruling political equation in the states or the Centre, but they will be an indicator of the popularity of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and opposition parties ahead of four assembly elections likely by the end of the year.
They also pose a key question on the future of the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in Uttar Pradesh.
The BJP swept to power on the back of a so-called Modi wave this summer, but failed to maintain the momentum in last month’s by-elections in four states where it lost a majority of seats to the Congress party and its allies.
The BJP and its allies together won only eight of the 18 seats that went to the polls while the Congress and its allies won 10.
This time around, political pundits are looking to see which way the wind blows in the Saturday bypolls spread across Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Assam, Gujarat, Tripura, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Sikkim.
 
The results of two Lok Sabha seats — Vadodara which was vacated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Medak in Telangana — are unlikely to throw any surprises. But Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav’s prestige is at stake in his home turf Mainpuri, the third Lok Sabha seat.
Read: Irrespective of result, Mainpuri poised to script electoral history
 
In the last Lok Sabha polls, a large number of OBCs and Dalits rallied behind the BJP across the Hindi belt. The shift dented the SP and BSP’s support base in the largest electoral state. The SP won just seven seats while Mayawati’s BSP drew a blank.
 
The grand alliance of the RJD-JDU-Congress could halt the BJP’s charge into this caste base. In the absence of such an alliance in Uttar Pradesh, any further losses may lead to an existential crisis for the two caste-based parties.
 
If the opposition parties -- especially the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress in Rajasthan, Gujarat and Assam -- can stop the BJP’s march, their claim about the Modi wave waning will receive a further boost.

With elections in Maharashtra and Haryana due next month, any by-election victory will also give the beleaguered Congress a fresh face saver after its humiliating Lok Sabha defeat.
 
But it may not be so easy for the opposition. Of the 33 seats, 11 are in Uttar Pradesh where the BJP swept 71 of 80 Lok Sabha seats.
In Gujarat and Rajasthan, where 13 assembly seats are up for grabs, the opposition could not even open its account in the general election.
Three seats are heading for the polls in Congress-ruled Assam where the BJP bagged 50% of Lok Sabha constituencies.

In West Bengal, the ruling Trinamool Congress will be desperate to win both seats as it wants to show that the Saradha scam has not hurt the party’s prospects.
For the BJP, a win or even a number two position in the results from Assam and Bengal will further cement its position as a fast emerging force, replacing traditional opposition parties like AGP and Left, respectively.
The by-elections in Chhattisgarh, Sikkim, Andhra and Tripura will test if the ruling parties can further consolidate their positions. Tripura is the only state where the Left is in power.

After being informed that the government was sending them to Jammu by aircraft9*, several labourers from Bihar and Punjab had gathered at the airport in Srinagar. However, once they reached there, they allege that they were beaten and asked for Rs 4,000 per ticket.
“I had Rs 500 with me. Somehow I managed to reach the airport…After waiting five days, however, we are not able to talk to an official who can help us. We were beaten ruthlessly,” says Surinder Kumar, a native of Gurdaspur in Punjab who has been working in Srinagar as a carpenter for the last 25 years.
He says his only option is to walk along the Jammu-Srinagar highway hoping to reach home. Several others accompany him. “We do not know the exact route. We will just follow this railway track that joins the highway,” says Milan Jeet, Surinder’s companion.

Blast in Bijnor  ATS beginsprobePrint
Express News Service | Lucknow | Posted: September 13, 2014 3:57 am
A low-intensity blast occurred in a house in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh, Friday morning — a day before bypolls are scheduled to be held in the Assembly constituency — prompting the police and Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) teams to rush to the spot.
Initial reports have revealed that four youths were assembling bombs in a room they had rented at Jalan locality under Kotwali police station area when the explosion occurred.
While the youths escaped, the locals said that one of them had sustained burn injuries in his hand and chest.
Three voter-ID cards, carrying a Hindu name and the others Muslim names, issued from Khandwa and Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh and Nandubar in Maharashtra, have been recovered from the room. Bijnor Superintendent of Police Satyendra Kumar Singh said they are trying to trace the holders of these voter-ID cards.
Besides, nearly seven kg matchsticks kept in cartons, four big packets of matchboxes, low-intensity explosives and remains of an half-assembled bomb were recovered from the room.
A .32 bore pistol, a laptop and two books in Urdu were also found.
Sources said the ATS has got vital clues about the youths and that their identities most likely match with suspects having links with a terror outfit.
However, further verification of the identity of the four youths is underway.
Moradabad Range DIG Gulab Singh said the four had taken the one-room accommodation on rent from an old woman, Leelo Devi, two months ago.
Leelo Devi, who lives alone, told the police that the youths had told her that they were Hindu and belonged to Moradabad. They told her that they were searching for jobs.

SC seeks Centre report on relief  rescueoperationsPrint
Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: September 13, 2014 3:55 am | Updated: September 13, 2014 4:09 am
The Supreme Court Friday appealed for a “national response” to the disaster caused by the recent floods in J&K and urged the Centre and the state government to ensure adequate steps are timely taken for relief and rehabilitation of those affected.
“It needs no emphasis from us that a calamity and disaster as huge as this deserves national response so that immediate relief is made available to the victims of floods. It goes without saying that supply of food, drinking water, medicines, fuel and other essential supplies deserve top-most priority, as also the restoration of communication and provision for health-care facilities,” said a bench led by Chief Justice of India R M Lodha.
“After all, lives of people who are affected by such disaster have to be saved,” the bench, also comprising Justices Kurian Joseph and Rohinton F Nariman, said while asking the Centre to apprise it on Monday about the urgent steps undertaken to accelerate rescue, relief and rehabilitation operations.
The court, which noted that “massive floods in the Kashmir valley have created horror” affecting more than 400 villages and stranding five lakh people, also asked the Centre to consider forming a unified agency for proper co-ordination of work.
It took on record the statement by Attorney General that “Union of India is conscious of the seriousness of the situation and a committee headed by the Prime Minister is overseeing and coordinating the rescue and relief operations” and “rescue operations by the Armed Forces are working in full swing and the Chief of the Army Staff himself is monitoring these operations”.
Calls for help to make HC functional soon
The Supreme Court described the J&K High Court as the “face of the judiciary and constitutional machinery” in the state and sought the Centre’s assistance in making it functional as soon as possible. Informed about the HC complex totally submerged in water, the court said the central and state governments must provide best available resources and some alternative accommodation where even a single judge in a one-room or two-room establishment can start holding court.

Swaraj at SCO summit: Need global action againstterrorSwaraj with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Dushanbe on Friday. ( Source: PTI )
Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: September 13, 2014 3:54 am
India on Friday said that it has submitted its formal application for entry into the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), as External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said that New Delhi is ready to step up its engagement with the grouping.
Swaraj, who is in Dushanbe to attend the SCO summit in Tajikistan, said that India was ready to step up engagement with the SCO and hoped that the grouping will be able to meet key challenges like the scourge of terrorism facing the region.
“We have today imparted a new energy and momentum to our ties with our immediate and extended neighbourhood. Our government is ready to step up its engagement with the SCO and contribute more meaningfully to its activities,” she said.
“In keeping with this objective, we have submitted our formal application for the full membership of the SCO to the current SCO chair. We hope to lay the foundation of a new relationship with the SCO region which will draw strength from our ancient links while preparing together to address the opportunities and challenges of the 21st century,” she said.
The annual SCO summit, attended by the presidents of Russia, China, Afghanistan and Iran, among others cleared administrative hurdles to grant membership to India, Pakistan and Iran into the China-dominated grouping that is increasingly seen as a counterweight to NATO.
The SCO comprises China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, and has Afghanistan, India, Iran, Mongolia and Pakistan as observers besides Belarus, Turkey and Sri Lanka as dialogue partners.
“The summit of the SCO is taking place at a crucial juncture in global politics, with many nations facing violence and conflict. We need to reflect collectively on all these events of deep geo-political significance,” Swaraj said.
India has been an observer at the SCO since 2005 and has generally participated at the ministerial-level at the grouping’s summits, which focus mainly on security and economic cooperation in the Eurasian space.

Within 2-3 minutes  village vanished under thelandslideVillagers inspect damage caused by the landslide at Saddal village in Udhampur. (Express)
Written by Arun Sharma | Jammu | Posted: September 13, 2014 3:52 am | Updated: September 13, 2014 4:09 am
Life of 60-year-old Kapoor Singh is shattered. He has lost six family members in a landslide which buried Saddal village in Pancheri block of Udhampur district last Saturday.
Kapoor’s wife, daughter, eldest son, daughter-in-law, two grandchildren were among the 40 feared dead in the landslide. His eldest son’s brother-in-law, who had been staying with them, was also buried alive in the debris. Kapoor and his 24-year-old son Ganesh are now the only surviving members.
Kapoor was the village head’s house following a call for help, while Ganesh was in Katra when the incident occured.
So far, only 11 bodies have been recovered, while search for remaining victims is still on.
The district administration has sought help for environment and geology experts as manual search for the bodies appeared too little and heavy machines could not be used due to loose soil.
“On Saturday, Kapoor Singh alongwith his eldest son Rajeev reached my house at around 10 am. We had already started bringing out our luggage as my house started developing cracks,” said village panch Kartar Singh. After over an hour, Rajeev got a call from his home and left, while Kapoor continued to help them until he also received a call from his son asking him to return immediately. “We were preparing to go to his house when we heard a loud bang and saw the entire hill moving down engulfing everything that came its way,” said Kartar.
“Before we could understand anything, the ground below us started shaking. We immediately started running away from the site leaving everything behind,” he said.
“Everybody in the village — around 350 families — started running for life. It was dust all over,” Kartar recalled. They finally stopped at Saroli Top at around 5 pm.
In the meantime, villagers living on the nearby hills also came out of their houses and saw Saddal getting buried under the landslide. “Within two-three minutes, the entire village vanished under the landslide,” said Surjit Singh, sarpanch of Galiote panchayat.
With no power supply over the past few days and the telecommunication system disrupted, some villagers walked to Pancheri and informed the police about the incident.
DIG Udhampur-Reasi range Garib Dass immediately rushed a team to Saddal on Saturday night itself. On Sunday, a police team led by an ASP, besides members of NDRF and doctors were airlifted from Udhampur.

SBI plans to roll out stock options for employeesSBI plans to roll out stock options for employees
K RAM KUMAR
Arundhati Bhattacharya
Mumbai, September 10:  
In a move that is the first of its kind in the public sector banking space, State Bank of India plans to roll out an employee stock option scheme (ESOS) for its 2.19 lakh employees.
Even as the scheme is in the works, India’s largest bank has dropped its earlier plan to come out with an employee stock purchase scheme.
The move to offer ESOS is aimed at motivating employees to perform better as also to attract and retain talent.
Competition to attract experienced bankers has intensified with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) granting “in-principle” approval in April to IDFC and Bandhan Financial Services to set up banks in the private sector. The central bank is also expected to issue universal bank licences on tap.
On the status of stock purchase scheme, SBI Chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya, in an interview with BusinessLine, said: “Actually, then (in March 2014) I had talked about ESPS. At that point, our shares were at a very low price and it would have made sense. But since then the price has improved and it is difficult for employees to purchase now.”
Therefore, SBI is now considering an ESOS, that will give an employee the right to purchase or subscribe to the securities offered by the bank at a future date, and at a predetermined price.
The SBI chief said her intention is to make ESOS available to all employees and quickly. “We have to find out performance parameters for every job. So, that is a big job. We are looking at how that can be done,” she said.
The Finance Ministry is agreeable “in-principle”. “We have to take permissions from others, including the RBI. The way it will be done will have to be advised to the ministry and final approval got,” she said.
The SBI chief said that if an employee performs in line with the target given to him/her then he/she will get a certain number of options, which will be locked in for a period of time, say one year. “If it hasn’t gone up by then that means you (employee) have not worked hard enough for the company. So, to make it go up, you have to work hard,” Bhattacharya said in a lighter vein.
Stock split
On the possibility of SBI going in for a stock split, she said: “How do you know we are not doing it? These are things that we will do when we think the time is right.”

(Former Civil Aviation Minister…)
NEW DELHI: Former Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel tonight trashed claims made by former Comptroller and Auditor General Vinod Rai that he had nudged Air India to go in for largescale purchase of aircraft.
"I rubbish the claims made by Vinod Rai. A former bureaucrat, Rai should know the rules of business of government. Decisions of such nature can only be taken after clearance of the Project Investment Board and approval of the Union Cabinet," he told PTI.
Rai has claimed that he was under pressure to drop the name of Patel from the auditor's report on the purchase of aircraft for the public carrier. Rai had stated that Patel had nudged Air India to in for largescale purchase of aircraft.
The former CAG claimed that all hell broke loose when the draft CAG report reached the ministry and bureaucrats tried to prompt him to drop the word "nudge".
Refuting the charge, Patel said, "In this case, Air India Board took the decision and it was the Empowered Group of Ministers headed by P Chidambaram which decided on the number of aircraft (to be purchased) and this was approved by the Union Cabinet."
Patel said Rai should be made aware that he had ceased to be the Civil Aviation Minister in January, 2011 and that the auditor had submitted his report some six months later.
"The question of anyone going to him (Rai) and talking to him or his officers at my behest from the Civil Aviation ministry itself contradicts his claims and I don't wish to join issue with people like him," he said.

Supreme Court clears 3% quotas for disabled  in jobs promotionsSupreme court asked the Centre to show a big heart and give the differently-abled people their due in all central and state government jobs.
Written by Utkarsh Anand | New Delhi | Posted: September 13, 2014 4:27 am
The Supreme Court on Friday ruled in favour of three per cent reservation for differently-abled candidates in civil services, not only at the stage of their appointments but also for departmental promotions.
Giving a level-playing field to more than four crore people with disabilities in India, the apex court held that the Centre, states and Union Territories were obligated to implement the rules of reservation for this class in the matters of appointment, selection, direct recruitment, deputation and also for promotions. It asked the Centre to show a big heart and give the differently-abled people their due in all central and state government jobs.
A bench led by Chief Justice of India R M Lodha reiterated its earlier verdict that the principle of not exceeding 50 per cent reservation would not be applicable while granting quota for differently-abled people.
The bench expressed its displeasure at the government seeking to adopt a hyper-technical approach, as its counsel pressed that three per cent reservation could be given only at the stage of appointment but not for promotion. The Persons With Disabilities Act provides for three per cent quota for the differently-abled people.
“Appointment will include promotion. You are frustrating the very reservation policy for the disabled — the class for which this beneficial piece of legislation was enacted, by arguing against it,” the bench, also comprising Justices Kurian Joseph and Rohinton F Nariman, told Additional Solicitor General Pinky Anand.
Anand sought to point out that the reservation at the stage of promotion may lead to huge resentment, especially among employees in Group A and Group B categories, since many beneficiaries may get ahead of their seniors.
She was placing an appeal against the Bombay High Court order, directing the government to implement three per cent reservation for the differently-abled in civil services recruitment, besides granting the benefit in the matter of promotion too. This order was issued on a PIL filed by the National Confederation for Development of Disabled, which was represented by senior advocate R S Suri and Arpit Bhargava in the apex court.
The bench, however, told the Additional Solicitor General that the objective of the reservation policy, as envisaged by Parliament, was unequivocal that the differently-abled people must get the benefits without technical impediments.
“Once Parliament prescribes for reservation in appointments, it will cover direct recruitment, promotion and even deputation. Our experience tells us that it is one legislation that has never been effectively implemented. In any case, it is a beneficial legislation and you should interpret in a manner so that they get the benefits,” said the bench.
At this, the Additional Solicitor General agreed with the bench and conceded not to press the appeal any further. The court continued…

WASHINGTON -- Though the law will be a year older, Republicans will push a vote to repeal Obamacare if they take back the Senate in November, a top GOP senator told reporters Thursday morning.
“I suspect we will vote to repeal early to put on record the fact that we Republicans think it was a bad policy and we think it is hurting our constituents,” said Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), appearing at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. “We think health care costs should be going down, not up. We think people should be able to keep the insurance that they had. They are worried about the fact that the next shoe to drop is going to be employer coverage.”
As Portman’s remarks indicated, a repeal vote by a Republican-controlled Senate would be a largely perfunctory exercise, designed to register GOP opposition with the health care law once again. The president would never sign such a measure, even if he were severely chastened by the 2014 election results. Even top conservative donors concede as much .
What's more, the dynamics would be complicated by the fact that the next Congress convenes during the Affordable Care Act's second open-enrollment period, meaning a repeal vote would be taking place at the same time that people were signing up for coverage under the law.
Portman said that Senate Republicans should present an alternative health care proposal to couple with the repeal effort.
"I think we should,” he said. "I think it is something that ought to go along with repeal to say, 'Yes, we think this is the wrong way to go. But we also think the health care system must be improved.'"
The idea that the GOP will come up with an alternative to Obamacare is enough to make many health care reform advocates roll their eyes. House Republicans have been promising an alternative health care bill for years to go along with their numerous repeal votes. No such bill has materialized .
Absent an agreement to uproot the existing health care law, Portman argued that a GOP-controlled Senate and House could end up reaching agreement with the president on more piecemeal reforms. Those include repealing the law’s medical device tax, a proposal that has wide bipartisan support, and pursuing tort reform, which is less likely to happen.
"I'm hopeful that we can find some common ground on some issues," said Portman. “Yes, we are for repeal. Yes, we’re for replacing it all. But there are also some specific things where I think the Senate and the House could act and the president would actually sign legislation."

IPhone 6 pre-orders crash Apple StoreIPhone 6 pre-orders crash Apple Store and iPhone 6 Plus sells out
By David Goldman   @DavidGoldmanCNN September 12, 2014: 9:59 AM ET
 
See Apple's new iPhone 6 in :60
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
The iPhone 6 became available for pre-order on Apple's online store Friday morning -- though "available" is a relative term.
Eager customers encountered lengthy delays, and others couldn't even access the website.
Some customers were reporting that the larger iPhone 6 Plus had sold out.
Apple ( AAPL , Tech30 ) wouldn't comment on that.
Pre-order snafus are commonplace for the iPhone, though they have been minimized in recent years after Apple opened its massive data center in North Carolina. Still, the iPhone 6 is widely anticipated to be the best-selling iPhone of all time, so it's not surprising that demand overwhelmed the company's servers.
On Tuesday, Apple unveiled the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus. The new iPhones have curved edges and bigger screens that measure 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches, up from just four inches on the iPhone 5S.
Both new iPhones feature Apple's new A8 processor, which is 25% faster than the iPhone 5S.
Both iPhones will be available in stores on Sept. 19. The iPhone 6 starts at $199, and the iPhone 6 Plus will start at $299.
 
The iPhone evolved
Amazingly, the new iPhone wasn't even the star of the show during Apple's presentation on Tuesday. The company's new Apple Watch and Apple Pay mobile payments systems are receiving most of the buzz this week.

SeaWorld is facing yet another lawsuitthis time for how it handled shareholders  not orcasSeaWorld has had a rough go on Wall Street.PRNewsFoto/SeaWorld

A Michigan man who invested in SeaWorld has filed a lawsuit against the marine theme park operator, seeking damages on behalf of everyone who purchased stock in the company between April 2013 and August 2014. The investor, Lou Baker, and his lawyers  alleged  that the company artificially inflated its share prices by downplaying the effect of the Blackfish documentary on park attendance. The Rosen Law Firm, which is representing Baker, announced last month that it was “investigating potential securities claims” against SeaWorld. Now the lawsuit has materialized, though it has not yet been certified with class-action status. SeaWorld declined to comment on the litigation.
Blackfish, one of the most talked-about films of 2013, had an outsized and lasting effect on public perceptions of SeaWorld, prompting campaigns to boycott the park in protest of its flagship attraction—captive killer whales trained to perform in circus-like shows. Many people who watched Blackfish, in theaters over the summer of 2013 and on CNN broadcasts last fall, came away with a strong impression that keeping whales in captivity for entertainment is unjustifiable.  SeaWorld’s reputation was tarnished , to say the least.
SeaWorld, which had its initial public offering in April 2013, initially told investors not to worry about the Blackfish effect. As park attendance dropped (by 9% in the second quarter of 2013 ) and the stock dipped in the months following the film’s release, CEO Jim Atchison maintained that this had nothing to do with Blackfish—saying that bad weather, an early Easter, and high ticket prices were to blame.  August 2014  was when the company first acknowledged that its performance had been hurt by the Blackfish controversy.

Want to fight global warming Watch some car racing this weekendSeptember 12, 2014
Here’s the most important thing you can do this weekend: Turn on the television .
Formula E, a new motor racing championship , begins in Beijing tomorrow. The E stands for electric. As in electric cars. And there’s a lot riding on its success.
The money put in by sponsors is one thing. The investment by the participating teams is another, as are the jobs that have been created as a result. But if the new championship is a success, the most important outcome will not be profits for firms or continued employment for drivers, but the very future of private mobility.
The thinking goes something like this: Motor races in the late 19th and early 20th centuries drove some of the most major advancements in automotive technology. Developments by Peugeot in the 1910s had big effects on engine design. Later, things like fuel injection, commonplace in modern cars, were a direct result of innovations on the race track, says John Heitmann, president of the Society of Automotive Historians and a professor at the University of Dayton. Heitmann sees a similar revolution if electric car racing takes off. “There’s inordinate promise for technology transfer to go from racing to production,” he says.
The question of sustainability has been dogging motor sports for years. Even as Formula 1 has grown into a global behemoth, it has tried to reduce its environmental impact by changing engines to be more efficient . But that is incremental change. Formula E presents the chance to rethink engines altogether, and to create a market for innovation in electric cars and batteries.
“Motor sport has been losing a bit of its relevance. So this was a way to come back to where the mainstream is and to bring relevance to motor sport and do something useful for society,” says Alejandro Agag, a former Formula 1 man who owns the rights to Formula E and runs the company handling and promoting the championship.
Agag and his team have faced criticism along the way. Purists complain that the cars are too silent (hear for yourself in the video above), and that audience engagement tactics such as giving an extra power boost to the driver who receives the most tweets —perhaps materially altering the outcome of the race—are too gimmicky. But Agag argues that such innovations are necessary for a sport created in the 21st century. “It’s a designed media strategy consistent with the way media works in the modern world,” he says.

The latest attack on Americas car culture comes from Wall StreetSeptember 12, 2014
Is the automobile the “the most underutilized machine in the world”?
Morgan Stanley thinks it might be. The chart below comes from research published by the investment bank this week. The note is nominally about the global automotive/car rental/fleet management industries, but it really comes across as an ode to the app-enabled car service, Uber Technologies.
Tap image to zoom
The bank’s calculations for the chart are as follows:
Take the 1 billion cars in the world, driven 1 hour per day x 365 days = 365 billion hours of driving per year. That’s a big number… but it masks the 8.4 trillion hours that cars are NOT DRIVEN per year!
A lot of people have been arguing on Twitter that this is a meaningless statistic. A toothbrush, for example, is only utilized for a couple of minutes each day. But here’s the thing: A toothbrush does not require a large chunk of a person’s income and/or leverage to purchase, nor does it require ongoing maintenance and fuel costs.
“The amount of waste trapped in the system is hard to put into words,” Morgan Stanley writes, before proceeding to attempt just that:
We all know cars are depreciating assets and expensive to maintain, but seen this way, it appears consumers are destroying massive amounts of value by owning their vehicles! Applied to a $20 trillion global vehicle fleet, our calculation suggests trillions of dollars of wasted value. Then consider the ancillary costs of vehicle ownership, such as insuring, parking and maintaining a car that is actually used rather infrequently.
The investment bank is not explicitly bullish on Uber. It provides no projections for the company’s finances, for example. But there is plenty of blue-sky thinking about its potential to transform the fleet management and car rental industries.  For example, Morgan Stanley argues Uber could eventually become the owner of a fleet of autonomous vehicles that make renting cars so cheap that ownership becomes completely redundant:
Perhaps Uber founder Travis Kalanick’s motto should be: We will make taxis so cheap that only rich people will own cars.
It will take another 20 years until we reach “autopia,” when all cars on the roads are fully autonomous, the report claims.
Tap image to zoom
Which is fun to think about, and entirely plausible—but also completely impossible to prove.
There is at least one more reason that this report is interesting.  Sell-side research departments of investment banks don’t typically write up detailed research on unlisted companies. But now that their clients (such as mutual funds) are increasingly investing in startups before they go public, there is a reason for them to do so, at least informally.
Uber hasn’t said anything about going public (it just completed a mammoth funding round so there’s no rush), but if and when that happens, the company is certain to be one of the most coveted IPOs on Wall Street.

US stocks: Wall Street ends 5-week string of gainsDow Jones Industrial Average
(US stocks fell on Friday…)
NEW YORK: US stocks fell on Friday as energy shares extended their recent slide, while rising bond yields drove down high-dividend paying shares.
Major indexes finished lower after five straight weeks of gains.
The S&P energy index fell 1.5 per cent and was among the day's worst-performing sectors as US oil prices shed 0.6 per cent.
The energy group was down 3.7 per cent for the week. Shares of Exxon Mobil Corp retreated 1.3 per cent on the day, while ConocoPhillips fell 1.2 per cent.
The S&P utilities sector dropped 1.8 per cent while telecommunications fell 1.2 per cent as benchmark US bond yields posted their biggest weekly increase in over a year.
Solid US retail sales and consumer sentiment data on Friday added to concerns the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates sooner than some investors had expected.
"What's been creeping into investors' minds is the inevitability of the Fed raising rates and whether they're going to do it sooner rather than later," said Bruce Zaro, chief technical strategist, Delta Global Asset Management in Boston.
The Fed will hold a two-day policy meeting next week. At its conclusion, some investors and economists expect the central bank may tweak the wording of its policy statement to take on a more hawkish tone.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 61.49 points, or 0.36 per cent, to 16,987.51, the S&P 500 lost 11.91 points, or 0.6 per cent, to 1,985.54 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 24.21 points, or 0.53 per cent, to 4,567.60.
For the week, the Dow was down 0.9 per cent, the S&P 500 was down 1.1 per cent and the Nasdaq was down 0.3 per cent.
The largest per centage gainer on the New York Stock Exchange was Noranda Aluminum Holding, which rose 32.78 per cent, while the top per centage decliner was Hyperdynamics, down 9.32 per cent.
Among the most active stocks on the NYSE were Sprint, up 6.54 per cent to $7.00, and US-listed shares of Petrobras , down 7.09 per cent to $16.38.
On the Nasdaq, Yahoo, up 3.9 per cent to $42.88; Apple, up 0.2 per cent to $101.66; and eBay, up 3.0 per cent to $52.19, were among the most actively traded.
EBay pared earlier gains of as much as 4.7 per cent after the company dismissed market speculation that Google Inc may be preparing to buy a slice of the company.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,460 to 630, for a 3.90-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 1,818 issues fell and 872 advanced for a 2.08-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.
The broad S&P 500 index posted 16 new 52-week highs and six new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 59 new highs and 36 new lows.
About 6.0 billion shares changed hands on US exchanges, above the 5.5 billion average for the last five sessions, according to data from BATS Global Markets.

Warning of costs  court slams CBI for hurry in closing BirlacaseThe court also asked the CBI to explain why it had ruled out the “element of criminality” in the allocation to Hindalco.
Written by Kaunain Sherrif | New Delhi | Posted: September 13, 2014 4:37 am
A Delhi court on Friday pulled up the CBI over the closure report filed in a coal block allocation case against Kumar Mangalam Birla-owned Hindalco. The investigating agency was rebuked after it told the court that the original minutes of the screening committee meeting, in which Hindalco’s application seeking coal blocks was taken up, were “missing”.
Special Judge Bharat Parashar told the CBI that it should “keep its house in order”, failing which the court would “start imposing cost on the top officials of the CBI and deduct the cost from their salaries”. Stating that the CBI had made a “mockery” of the closure report, Parashar asked the agency why it was in a “hurry” to file one.
The agency, which informed the court that primary evidence containing original minutes of the screening committee meeting was missing, was asked by the judge to submit written documents to back the same. “Show if there was any statement which says that original minutes of the meeting of the screening committee were missing… did you think the court will accept the closure report with closed eyes?” Parashar said.
The investigation officer (IO), who failed to submit the primary evidence containing original minutes of the meeting, had submitted secondary evidence in support of the closure report, saying that the “relevant” bank officials had authenticated the same. The court responded: “Can a bank official authenticate the documents of the Coal Ministry? What provisions of the law prevented you take authentication from the ministry officials. How can you submit secondary evidence like this?”
The court proceedings then saw another twist as the judge ordered the IO to get the police file and case diary within an hour from its Delhi headquarters, based on which the agency had initiated the preliminary enquiry into the case. “What kind of investigation have you done? What was the supervisory officer (SO) doing? Bring the police file and case diary and call your supervisory officer to the court now,” the judge told the IO.
The SO, who then appeared before the court, was told: “You have a legal department. I am sure you have consulted them before filing the closure report. When you filed the report, have you at least made sure that it is legally sustainable?”
The court questioned the SO further and asked whether the agency had “analysed” the facts of the case according to the evidence Act. “You have collected the facts and suddenly jumped to a conclusion. My query is, did you even understand the facts of the case according to the evidence Act before coming to a conclusion? Every chargesheet should run like a story. There is no sequence in your story,” the special judge said.
The court also continued…

BJP tried to contact 15 of our MLAs  have recordings:SisodiaSisodia attacked Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung for not dissolving the Assembly so that fresh elections could take place.
Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: September 13, 2014 4:32 am
After alleging that the BJP offered money to Aam Aadmi Party MLA Dinesh Mohaniya to resign, AAP leader Manish Sisodia on Friday said that his party had conducted more such “sting operations”. At The Indian Express Idea Exchange programme, Sisodia said that “around 15 MLAs” were approached by the BJP, and that the AAP would release videos to back this at a later stage.
“Yes, we have certain recordings, but I can’t reveal this in Idea Exchange right now. The only thing I will say is that they tried to contact around 15 of our MLAs, out of which three or four, they believed, would break away. One of them must have been Dinesh Mohaniya,” Sisodia said.
The AAP had released a video on Monday, which purportedly showed Delhi BJP vice-president Sher Singh Dagar talking with Mohaniya, the AAP MLA from Sangam Vihar, about resigning in exchange for money. Following the incident, the BJP had issued a showcause notice to Dagar.
Explaining how AAP MLAs were allegedly approached by the BJP, Sisodia said, “They first come to our MLAs’ office, then go back, the sequence is like that. We have not told our MLAs to go to BJP MLAs and knock at their doors for conducting stings, but it is obvious our MLAs are being approached. It begins with a small-level worker approaching our MLAs, that is the sequence… We have recordings in several cases.”
Responding to Amit Shah’s comment that a junior-level worker’s actions should not be considered a reflection of the party’s stand, Sisodia said, “The state V-P is not a lower-level worker.”
With Delhi under President’s rule since the AAP government resigned after 49 days in power, Sisodia attacked Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung for not dissolving the Assembly so that fresh elections could take place.
“Of everything LG sir has done till now, the letter written by him was the most shocking for us. In his letter, instead of expressing his opinion, he has expressed his wish… He already knows what the situation is. Twenty-seven MLAs of the Assembly are filing complaints that these are the practices that are being followed, there are attempts for horse trading, attempts to threaten MLAs. He should take into account the fact that 27 MLAs are writing to him. He hasn’t considered this at all. Instead, he just looked at the mathematics, seen which is the single largest party, and tried to give them an option once.
That is not correct. Instead, he could have apprised the president of the entire situation, he could have told him that on one side, this is the largest party, and on the other side, AAP’s 27 MLAs have also come to me and said that these guys are trying to horse trade and threaten. We continued…

Caution when considering loans from a 401(k)0
If your pay is $50,000 a year now, you would need to have accumulated $120,000. If you think you can get by on 70 percent of your last year of pay in retirement, then at 40 you'd need two times your current pay — or $100,000 if your income is $50,000.
Still, even if you are close to being on target with your saving, I am reluctant to suggest borrowing from your 401(k) to pay off credit card debt.
You are likely to save yourself some substantial interest charges if you do wipe out your card debt with a 401(k) loan. Paying about 4.5 percent interest to repay a 401(k) loan makes a lot more sense than paying 12 percent on credit cards. And when you pay interest on the 401(k) loan, the money goes back into your savings, not to a bank.
But often when people wipe out their credit card debt with an alternative loan, they don't take the steps to build a more carefree future by setting up a budget, looking for cuts in expenses or finding an extra job. Before they know it, they are stuck with a lot of debt again.
Research by TIAA-CREF of people who have borrowed from 401(k) plans shows that 43 percent borrow a second time. So, clearly, the first loan didn't give them the fresh start they imagined.
And when they borrow from their 401(k), they undermine their future ability to build the retirement money easily.
Why? The larger the sum of your early savings, the more interest or return you make for the future, even if you add modest amounts as you near retirement. So a nice sum in your 401(k) at 40 means you are making your future less stressful. Consider the impact of time on tiny early life savings: A person who puts $25 a week into a 401(k) starting at 21, invests it in a balanced mutual fund of stocks and bonds, and leaves it there, is likely to have close to $1 million by retirement. A person who would like the same nest egg, but waits until age 45 to start saving, would have to save about $300 a week. Painful!
Now consider a 401(k) loan impact: Let's say you decide to borrow $20,000.
If you try the "Should I borrow from my 401(k)" calculator (bankrate.com/calculators/retirement/borrow-from-401k-calculator.aspx) you will see that you will end up at retirement with about $20,000 less than you would if you hadn't touched the money. I assumed that your 401(k) stock and bond mutual funds earn about 8 percent a year, on average, and that you'd repay your 401(k) loan over the typical five years at an interest rate of 4.5 percent.
If you end up failing to repay the $20,000 you borrowed, you will have $399,000 less at retirement than if you'd left your money in the 401(k).
Now, you probably have every intention of repaying your loan as required over five years. But if you fail to repay it, the federal government will make you pay taxes and a 10 percent penalty on the money you withdraw from the 401(k).
So if it was $20,000, your federal taxes could be $5,600 if you are in the 28 percent tax bracket. Also, there would be state taxes and a federal penalty of $2,000. So your $20,000 loan is a lousy deal. You end up giving Uncle Sam more than $7,600 of it.
About 86 percent of people who lose their jobs end up failing to pay back their 401(k) loan and suffer the penalties, according to research by the Pension Research Council at the University of Pennsylvania. The government generates more than $1 billion this way.
If you lose your job, you typically are given 60 to 90 days to pay off the loan.

The Ramnath Goenka Awards for Excellence in Journalism are truly a fitting tribute to the man they are named after, who would never get bogged down by the difficult circumstances that came his way in delivering unbiased news to people. He was a warrior for the freedom of the press, and will always be remembered for his efforts to strengthen the fourth pillar of democracy.
The Goenka awards have become a benchmark for quality journalism in print and TV. I never got to personally meet Ramanath Goenka, but who is not aware of his fearlessness? He raised issues relevant to the common man, to society and to politics, and effectively highlighted the weaknesses and drawbacks of the administration. In this way, he contributed to the strengthening of democracy. During the Emergency, he gave the media a new direction.
Journalists who have carried out their professional responsibilities in the most remarkable manner and done exemplary work in their chosen area are being awarded. I believe they will continue to raise visible and invisible issues in order to spread knowledge and awareness among the people, and will carry on the fight for a more aware citizenry, mature democracy and transparent governance.
The press and its freedom are an inseparable part of any democracy. In our struggle for independence, the media played a big role in uniting people and raising awareness among them. Many of our leaders were actively associated with newspapers in delivering their thoughts to the people, in criticising the foreign administration and circulating ideas among them. All this happened despite the colonial government’s efforts to regulate and control the press.
The media is the fourth pillar of democracy. The level of responsibility and transparency expected of the other pillars is equally expected of the press. A free and fearless press benefits society and the nation. Today, technology has changed, the nature of competition among media companies has changed, society is being transformed and values are being redefined. In such fast-changing times, reporters bring the important issues to the people’s attention. The dissemination of information is thus an effective medium to empower the people in a democracy.
The range of the media’s work has grown. Along with news about entertainment and personalities, if you could fill your pages with news about environment, health, education, society, cities and villages, it would help in the progress of the nation. One always expects the media to take a positive approach because it has contributed immensely to freedom, to the building of a nation in the past, and to strengthening it now. If news continued…

UP 2014  like Punjab 1947The supposed civilisational war between the West and Islam, and the emergence of fanatical groups like the ISIS, are directly relevant to the 40 million or more Muslims living in UP.
Written by Rajmohan Gandhi | Posted: September 12, 2014 12:14 am | Updated: September 12, 2014 8:42 am
Not long ago, while working on a history of undivided Punjab, I found that in 1914 that vast province was seen as the subcontinent’s hope for economic progress and inter-communal understanding. Yet, in 1947, both halves of divided Punjab saw carnage that no part of the world should witness.
Recent events in Uttar Pradesh should caution Prime Minister Narendra Modi and others that this state, with its immense population, may now be drifting towards a tragedy the nation must never allow again. The Punjab tragedy involved the Empire. On February 20, 1947, London announced that it was about to leave all of India including Punjab, without saying who would inherit the province.
Either “the existing provincial government” would take over, said Her Majesty’s Government, or another arrangement that “may seem most reasonable” would be made. That word triggered two things. One was a Muslim League-led mass movement, which in a fortnight forced out the province’s coalition ministry, led by Khizar Hayat Khan of the rapidly declining Unionist Party but mainly sustained by the Congress and the Sikhs. The other was the creation of separate militias, Muslim, Hindu and Sikh, to force the future of different parts of Punjab.
After the killings in early March 1947 in the towns and villages of Rawalpindi and Multan, Lieutenant General Frank Messervy, the region’s top British officer, recorded his shock that “the normally chivalrous and decent Punjabi Muslim peasant” had been “aroused to such frenzied savagery”, and added: “There has also been a widespread desire to rid many areas of all Sikhs and Hindus, entirely for ever.”
Messervy had identified ethnic cleansing, but the Empire in retreat chose to look away. While London was focused on the safe return of India-based soldiers to Britain, there were elements in the Empire that did not mind an all-out conflict between Indians. Five months after Messervy wrote his note, the great bloodletting of August-September 1947 took place. A major incident, now entirely forgotten, had also occurred in western UP. In November 1946, a number of Muslims were massacred in Garhmukteshwar, not far from Meerut, Muzaffarnagar or Moradabad.
There is a global context for UP’s current tensions too. The supposed civilisational war between the West and Islam, and the emergence of fanatical groups like the ISIS, are directly relevant to the 40 million or more Muslims living in UP. Also of relevance to UP’s Muslims is the national and provincial context. From India’s ruling establishment, which includes the RSS and other workers/ warriors for Hindutva, two distinct and conflicting suggestions have emanated: build and burn. Construct bullet trains, bathrooms, bank accounts continued…

Poor marks for transparencyPrint
Written by Anjali Bhardwaj , Amrita Johri | Posted: September 12, 2014 12:20 am | Updated: September 12, 2014 10:38 am
For a government that won office on the plank of fighting corruption and promising ‘‘achhe din’’ to citizens disgruntled by poor service delivery, one would have thought putting in place an effective anti-corruption and grievance redressal framework would be a top priority. However, after 100 days of being in power, the Modi sarkar’s report card on transparency and accountability disappoints.
It is well established that openness in government functioning is a prerequisite for good governance. One of the key accomplishments of the UPA was the enactment of the RTI Act. However, its implementation remained lackadaisical and left much to be desired. When Team Modi promised transparent and accountable governance in its inimitable style, through impossible-to-miss advertisements in every newspaper, a natural expectation was that the transparency regime in the country would be strengthened.
Unfortunately, in the first 100 days of the Modi government, there is no perceptible improvement in the implementation of the RTI Act. On the contrary, for the first time since its constitution in 2005, the Central Information Commission (CIC) is headless. The post of the chief information commissioner, which fell vacant on August 22, has not yet been filled. This has serious ramifications, since the RTI Act envisages a critical role for the chief information commissioner, including superintendence, management and direction of the affairs of the CIC. In the absence of the chief, the functioning of the CIC is seriously impaired and the decisions given in the interim could be challenged in court.
Currently, close to 25,000 appeals and complaints are pending with the CIC and people have to wait for months, sometimes even years, for their cases to be heard. Not appointing a chief information commissioner is resulting in increasing the backlog of cases and greater delays for those who are denied information and are already frustrated by the long wait for justice. Information commissions are the adjudicators under the RTI law — if they do not function properly, it results in the violation of the critical right to information of ordinary citizens, who need it to hold their government accountable.
The 100 days also witnessed a positive development — the government revised the rules for the appointment of the anti-corruption ombudsman, the Lokpal. The Modi government has amended the UPA’s regressive rules and removed the problematic provision that empowered the Central government to shortlist candidates from which the search committee could recommend names to the selection committee. That provision had drawn the ire of the eminent jurists, Fali Nariman and Justice K.T. Thomas, who resigned from the search committee, stating that it had been rendered redundant as the rules did not allow the members to independently single out deserving persons who could be appointed to the Lokpal.
However, the new government has failed to address the most regressive provision in the rules, which effectively ensures that the non-judicial members of the Lokpal will comprise almost exclusively of bureaucrats. This implies that the Lokpal will join the long list of institutions in the country that, instead of being led by men continued…

John McCain Will Be Asked To Come On Cable News Until The Moment The Earth Stops Turning
reddit
Sometimes it seems that at any time of day, anywhere, John McCain will be on a news show, and he'll probably be grumpy.
McCain's endless appearances on TV are so well-known by now that they've become a clichéd shorthand for the media's tendency to turn to the same rotating cast of pundit-politicians over and over again. Even so, McCain's activity on Wednesday night was something to behold. He showed up on all of the big three cable news channels, one after the other, in the hour after President Obama's speech on ISIS.
Journalist Allison Kilkenny summed things up succinctly:
THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE BESIDES JOHN MCCAIN WHO CAN SAY WORDS
— allisonkilkenny (@allisonkilkenny) September 11, 2014
Anyone looking to avoid McCain was doomed. Tired of watching him maul a rather hapless Jay Carney on CNN? (Anderson Cooper underscored just how much cable news loves John McCain by noting that he had interviewed the senator "just last week.")
Well, too bad, because if you changed the channel to MSNBC, you would find...John McCain, arguing with Andrea Mitchell.
Desperate viewers who turned to Fox News for some salvation would also find themselves out of luck, because Sean Hannity soon welcomed none other than... John McCain for analysis he had already provided many times.
The only way to stop the juggernaut was to turn off the TV, but there's a remote possibility that John McCain and cable news bookers have collaborated on secret technology to invade everyone's dreams when they sleep.

Tom Brokaw Shares Great News About Cancer Battlereddit
Tom Brokaw has remained extremely optimistic throughout his battle against cancer, and the former "NBC Nightly News" anchor shared some more good news about his recovery Thursday morning.
Brokaw revealed in February that he had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a form of cancer of the plasma cells in bone marrow. Despite the diagnosis, Brokaw continued to call himself "the luckiest guy I know." While undergoing chemotherapy in the following months, Brokaw said that his doctors believed treatment would be "successful" and that he knows he is "going to have a big life going on from here."
He echoed that same courage on Thursday while guest co-hosting the "Today" show with Matt Lauer. Brokaw told viewers that not only is he "doing fine," but his cancer "appears to be gone."
"I've gotten some very good news in the last week," he said. "I hope that within six weeks, I can be on a drug maintenance program. The myeloma appears to be gone. I've got one more marker to get down to 0-0, and I'll be all right."
Brokaw explained that although the cancer will never be completely gone, it seems to be under control and can be managed.
"As I've said before, I'm a lucky guy," he said.

I m a legal immigrant  but can t workBy Sara Ashley O'Brien   @saraashleyo September 12, 2014: 12:16 PM ET
Rashi Bhatnagar has legally lived in the U.S. for 6 years but is unable to work.
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
A land of opportunities?
Not for Rashi Bhatnagar. She wants to open a home-goods business and says she has an "entrepreneurial spirit." But even though she's been legally living in the United States for almost six years, that's only a pipe dream.
Bhatnagar -- who has her masters in communication from the University of Delhi -- has an H-4 visa, which means she can't earn an income or possess a social security number.
Her situation isn't unusual.
H-4 visas are given to spouses of those on an H-1B visa (as well as a handful of other visas). The State Department said 96,753 people received the H-4 visa in 2013, 76% of whom were from South Asia.
"It's pretty much an Indian woman issue," said Shah Peerally, who heads up an immigration law firm in Newark, Calif. "Many are educated [and] some are really desperate to work."
In 2012, Indian immigrants received 64% of the allotted H-1B visas -- with the majority working in science, tech and engineering, according to Neil Ruiz of the Brookings Institution.
Related: I created 7 jobs and the U.S. tried to deport me
But Ruiz says it's not just Indian women who are suffering -- the entire U.S. loses out from this policy.
"In a world where everyone is competing, other countries like Canada are more competitive in giving both spouses and high-skilled workers authorization to work as soon as they arrive," he said.
The U.S. also misses out on the taxes that these immigrants would contribute if they were allowed to work. Ruiz said because H-1B visa holders are high skilled, it's likely that their spouses are highly skilled as well.
"If authorized to work, they would [likely] be high income earners," said Ruiz. "That means they'd be paying more taxes than the general population."
Moreover, they could also be creating new jobs.
 
This is what a deportation looks like
"I think the misconception is that they're going to take away from the limited pool of jobs," said Meghna Damani, a former H-4 holder, who has become an advocate for reform. "But they're not all participating in that limited pool. A lot of them are entrepreneurs who can actually create jobs."
Bhatnagar, 30, moved from India, after her husband's IT job sent him to Dallas. She admits they didn't fully understood that U.S. immigration policies meant she'd be unable to work and they'd be living off just one salary.
She's been using her time to check out retail stores in the U.S. to inform her future business venture.
"When I was in India, I didn't know what the U.S. market was like," she said. "In America, they have long coffee tables. In India, we have small coffee tables." Knowing differences like these will help her sell to U.S. stores when she's back in her home country.
She and her husband plan to move back to India next fall instead of waiting it out for their green cards (which can take up to ten years for Indian and Chinese citizens).
"I tell all my friends and cousins, please don't come here if you get this visa," said Bhatnagar.

H-4 visa holder Anagha Vartak hopes to start her own franchise business -- either in the food industry or education.
Originally from Mumbai, she moved to the U.S. with her husband in 2010. She has a masters degree and an MBA but has been unable to put them to use.
"I always think about going back home [where] I can be independent," said Vartak, who created an e-book with the stories of other H-4 holders. "It's not easy to make that choice because it's not easily accepted in the culture. I don't think a long distance relationship will last."
Vartak is holding out for her green card -- or the H-4 visa to be reformed.
In May 2014, the Department of Homeland Security proposed a rule that would allow some H-4 holders to work, although there would still be restrictions. During a 60-day comment period, 13,000 people responded to the proposed rule, but it could take as much as a year for DHS to make a decision.
"Right now, many like me are waiting," said Bhatnagar. "We don't know the timeline,"

Dollar index gains for 9th week  US dollar hits six-year high vs yenforex
(A drop in import prices,…)
NEW YORK: The dollar index posted its ninth consecutive week of gains on Friday and the US currency rose to six-year highs against the yen on speculation that the Federal Reserve may strike a more hawkish tone when it meets next week.
A recent string of improving economic data has raised expectations that the Fed may act sooner to raise interest rates, a move most investors expect will begin next year.
US retail sales data on Friday that showed spending rose broadly in August added to these expectations.
"The general message on the economy is that it's improving, but we still have a lot of slack to take up," said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.
US consumer sentiment also rose in September to its highest in more than a year on more upbeat views on the domestic economy in the coming year, a survey released on Friday showed.
A drop in import prices, however, capped some of the dollar's gains. Import prices declined 0.9 per cent in August, the largest drop since November 2013.
"The import prices were shockingly low," said Boris Schlossberg, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York. "It shows that there are no inflationary pressures in the economy and makes the market pause over whether the Fed is going to accelerate its rate hiking schedule."
Some investors have also been taking profits on concerns that the market may have moved too far before next week's highly anticipated meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making body.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, was last down 0.08 per cent at 84.227. It has risen for the ninth week, the most weeks the index has gained consecutively since 1997.
US Treasury yields have also been adjusting to the prospect of higher rates in more volatile trading. The two-year yield was not far from a three-year peak of 0.59 per cent.
"The main macro trigger is rising US yields," said Alvin Tan, a currency strategist at Societe Generale in London.
The dollar touched a high of 107.39 yen, its strongest since September 2008, and last traded at 107.30, up 0.18 per cent on the day.
US dollar strength has also been due to a worsening picture in Europe and Japan. The European Central Bank last week cut rates to new lows and launched an asset purchase program to ward off deflation.
The Bank of Japan was also expected to launch new stimulus measures to address low inflation and a flagging economy.

execution
A three-judge Bench led by Justice H.L. Dattu heard afresh the review petition of Nithari serial killings convict Surinder Koli
The Supreme Court on Friday stayed the execution of Nithari serial killings convict Surinder Koli till October 29. A three-judge Bench led by Justice H.L. Dattu posted the review petition filed by Koli , through counsel Indira Jaising, for detailed hearing on October 28.
The apex court allowed Ms. Jaising to inspect the records in the case and apply for certified copies of statements and confessions made by the accused. Koli is the first condemned man to benefit from a September 3 majority judgment authored by Justice Rohinton Nariman for a Constitution Bench.
The judgment had held that Supreme Court judges should review the question of life and death of a condemned man in public glare rather in the privacy of their chambers. The verdict declared that counsel for the condemned man should be given an opportunity to present oral arguments for a 30-minute duration.
The Constitution Bench led by Chief Justice of India R.M. Lodha had observed that “the fundamental right to life and the irreversibility of a death sentence mandate that oral hearing be given at the review stage in death sentence cases”.
The September 3 verdict declared that the Supreme Court would hear afresh dismissed and pending review petitions of death row convicts, provided they are filed in a month's time from the date of the judgment.
Of the three judges, Justices Dattu and Anil R. Dave were on the original review Bench which had dismissed Koli's review petition on July 25, this year.
On Friday, Justice S.A. Bobde joined the review Bench as required by the September 3 verdict, which said the presence of a third judge would represent an independent and fresh opinion in a death row review.
The revised Supreme Court Rules also requires review petitions of death row convicts to be heard by a Bench of minimum three judges. Friday's hearing comes five days after Justices Dattu and Dave stayed the execution of Koli for a week in a midnight order, just hours before he was to be hanged at Chaudhary Charan Singh jail.
Koli, 42, was found guilty of serial rapes and murders between 2005 and 2006 at his employer, businessman Moninder Singh Pandher's house in Nithari. Remains of several missing children were found near the house.
Koli was sentenced to death in four cases and his death sentence was confirmed by the Supreme Court in 2011.

After childhood in Mumbai red-light district  a UNawardShweta Katti, 19, got into Bard College last year
Written by Aamir Khan | Mumbai | Posted: September 13, 2014 4:42 am
Shweta Katti, who grew up in Mumbai’s red light district of Kamathipura, had her first breakthrough when she made it to the Bard College in New York last year. Now, there is another reason for the 19-year-old to celebrate: She has been selected by the United Nations Special Envoy for Education for the Youth Courage Award, given to girls from around the world for showing exemplary courage in promoting the cause of girls’ education and dignity of women.
The award also brought fresh excitement in the lives of a group of young girls in a suburban Mumbai flat, where the NGO Kranti offers accommodation and educational assistance to daughters of sex workers. Shweta’s education was funded by the same NGO.
Despite many hurdles in getting a passport and securing funds for her education, Shweta made it to Bard College last year to pursue a degree in psychology. Since then, she has used various public platforms to speak on how to overcome adversity, and has emerged as an icon for youngsters in similar circumstances.
An email Shweta received from a UK-based charitable organisation reads: “We have just been informed by the Office of the United Nations Special Envoy for Education that you will be one of their 2014 Youth Courage Award recipients. The envoy’s office will be in touch briefly with a formal notification.”
According to Robin Chaurasiya, the founder of Kranti, Shweta is the first girl from Mumbai’s red light district to have been picked for the honour.
But amid the excitement, a hint of uncertainty looms over the girls supported by Kranti. For one, Shweta is worried that funds for her education may dry out — she has not managed to raise money to pay for her education and allied expenses this semester.
Moreover, the NGO has only been able to raise a quarter of the total money for another girl, Sheetal Jain, to go to Levine Music School in Washington DC for a course in drumming.
While Sheetal requires Rs 12 lakh, Kranti has so far raised Rs 3 lakh — mostly through word-of-mouth and social media campaigning.
But these girls are no strangers to stumbling blocks. Apart from Shweta, three others, Sumaiya Sheikh, Pinky Sheikh and Rani Patil — all of them daughters of sex workers — have travelled abroad for various educational programmes in the past.
While Shweta intends to study in New York till June 2017, Sumaiya (13) completed her Wanakee Leadership Camp (survival skills programme) in New Hampshire from August 3-10, 2014. Before that, she went to Sidwell Summer Camp (for English, arts and science) in Washington DC from July 22 to August 1. Pinky (17) attended a 45-day ‘Songs of Hope’ performing arts camp in Minnesota in 2013, and Rani (13) attended the same this year. Rani also went to the camp in New Hampshire with Sumaiya.

Kerry plays down hopes of anti-Islamic State...ISIL
(US Secretary of State John…)
ANKARA: US Secretary of State John Kerry on Friday played down chances of an imminent broad coalition against Islamic State militants, illustrating the difficulty Washington faces winning commitment for a military campaign in the heart of the Middle East.
Kerry met Turkish leaders to try to secure support for US-led action against Islamic State, but Ankara's reluctance to play a frontline role highlighted the challenges of building a willing coalition to wage what will likely be a tough offensive.
Kerry has been touring the Middle East to build support for President Barack Obama's plan, announced on Wednesday, to strike both sides of the Syrian-Iraqi frontier to defeat Islamic State Sunni fighters, who control swathes of both countries.
On Thursday, Kerry won backing for a "coordinated military campaign" against Islamic State from 10 Arab countries - Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and six Gulf states including rich rivals Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
But it remains far from clear what role individual nations will play and while he confirmed France's commitment to use military force in Iraq, Kerry declined to say whether France would join a similar campaign in Syria.
That follows conflicting reports in key ally Britain over its potential role, with Prime Minister David Cameron on Thursday saying he has not ruled out military action in Syria after his foreign secretary said Britain would not take part in any air strikes there.
"It is entirely premature and frankly inappropriate at this point in time to start laying out one country by one country what individual nations are going to do," Kerry, who travels to Cairo on Saturday, told reporters, adding building a coalition would take time.
"I'm comfortable that this will be a broad-based coalition with Arab nations, European nations, the United States, others," he said. "At the appropriate time, every role will be laid out in detail."
Turkey, which has the second largest armed forces in the NATO military alliance after the United States and hosts a major US Air Force base at Incirlik in its south, has so far conspicuously avoided committing to any military campaign.
Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, who did not join the news conference with Kerry, said in a live interview on Turkish television hours after their meeting that US action in Iraq would not be enough on its own to bring political stability.
"It is necessary, but it is not enough to establish order," he told the Kanal 24 TV station.
US officials played down hopes of persuading Ankara to take a significant role in any military involvement, saying Friday's talks were focused on issues including Turkey's efforts to stem the flow of foreign fighters crossing its territory and its role in providing humanitarian assistance.
"The Turks have played an extraordinary role on humanitarian aspects of the situation ... and they are going to play and have been playing a pivotal role in our efforts to crack down on foreign fighter facilitation and counter terrorist finance," a senior US State Department official said.
  "AMBIGUITIES"
Obama's plan to fight Islamic State simultaneously in Iraq and Syria thrusts the United States directly into the midst of two different wars, in which nearly every country in the region has a stake, alliances have shifted and strategy is dominated by Islam's 1,300-year-old rift between Sunnis and Shi'ites.
Islamic State is made up of Sunni militants, who are fighting against a Shi'ite-led government in Iraq and a government in Syria led by members of a Shi'ite offshoot sect. It also battles against rival Sunni Islamists and more moderate Sunni groups in Syria, and Kurds on both sides of the border.
From the early days of the Syrian conflict, Turkey has backed mainly Sunni rebels fighting against President Bashar al-Assad. Although it is alarmed by Islamic State's rise, it is wary about any military action that might weaken Assad's foes.
It is also concerned about strengthening Kurds in Iraq and Syria. Turkey's own Kurdish militants waged a three-decade insurgency against the Turkish state and are engaged in a delicate peace process.
Kerry said it would be inappropriate for Shi'ite Iran, which has described the emerging coalition as "shrouded in serious ambiguities", to attend an Iraq conference in Paris on Monday to discuss how to tackle the Islamic State militants.
"Under the circumstances, at this moment in time, it would not be right for any number of reasons. It would not be appropriate given the many other issues that are on the table in Syria and elsewhere," he said.
Lebanese Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil told Reuters some Arab states at talks in Jeddah on Thursday had proposed expanding the campaign to fight other Islamist groups besides Islamic State, a move Turkey would also probably oppose.
Turkey's support for the rebels fighting Assad, including groups that some Western allies balked at backing, has laid it open to accusations it aided radical Islamists and contributed to Islamic State's rise, a notion Ankara strongly rejects.
Francis Ricciardone, who was until late June the US ambassador in Turkey, said on Thursday Ankara had supported groups including the Nusra Front, al Qaeda's Syrian branch, in the fight against Assad, much to the dismay of Washington.
"We ultimately had no choice but to agree to disagree," Ricciardone told a conference call arranged by the Atlantic Council think-tank on Thursday, in comments which highlighted the challenges of building a coalition.
"The Turks frankly worked with groups for a period, including al Nusra, whom we finally designated as we're not willing to work with," he said.

Bridging generation gap as boomers hang on to jobsBridging generation gap as boomers hang on to jobs
By Janet Kidd Stewart
Will management think retirement time is here before you do?
Companies bridge gaps as boomers put off retirement.
New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady generated a few additional headlines recently when asked about retirement.
"When I suck, I'll retire," the 37-year-old said in an interview that was picked up by Boston.com, then a host of others. Then Peyton Manning seconded the idea on ESPN.com.
It sounds tantalizingly simple, but as anyone nearing retirement — or any Brett Favre fan — knows, the endgame can be anything but smooth.
Will management think the time is here before you do? Will you jump to a rival in hopes of a final couple of good years? Will you manage to hang on, but end up staying too long and burning bridges to a more fulfilling second career? What happens if the newbie you're mentoring looks a lot like Aaron Rodgers?
All those options have repercussions for you and your company, which is why employers are trying to get better at managing different generations in the office and why you need to pay attention to the trends.
In a series of recent client notes, consulting firm Mercer urges companies to recognize the tension between young and old at work, and to plan for baby boom workers to hang on to their jobs.
0
"For those who choose to retire, many are going to realize … they don't have enough money to sustain themselves, and they'll be back in the workforce," Orlando Ashford, head of Mercer's talent business, said in a recent note. "The implications for employers are quite fascinating. How are you going to help retirees re-enter a changing workforce? How are you going to manage people in their second or third career, while engaging people who are in their first career at the same time?"
Some researchers, including the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, dispute the notion that baby boomers are creating employment bottlenecks and preventing masses of younger workers from advancing.
But at the level of an individual workplace, conflicts of all types are inevitable as employers try to manage overall staffing levels, reduce brain drain and attract young talent.
More than a decade ago, a veteran trauma nurse confided to executives at Scripps Health in San Diego that because of limits in the system's retirement plan, she would retire from Scripps, then pick up shifts with a rival that would allow her to work a reduced schedule.
"Here I was, losing a skilled nurse because our retirement plan encouraged it," said Victor Buzachero, corporate senior vice president for innovation, human resources and performance management.
Scripps later revamped its pension rules to allow for phased retirement and has since won accolades for its workplace policies.
One of its latest: training 9,000 employees on making business presentations that foster collaboration — a nod to the health system's rapidly growing Generation Y workforce.
"We spent a lot of time last year on visual mapping in facilitated communications, so instead of presenting completed plans, we use the Socratic method, questioning staff and ultimately having them provide direction forward" on a project, Buzachero said. "The Gen Y workers get all excited about this because we're engaging them, not telling them what to do.
"It's been very successful. Top-down management is OK in surgery or the ER, but when you sit down to problem-solve, it takes a different work environment."
At consulting firm Ernst & Young, where partners are subject to mandatory retirement at 60, but where staff can span several generations, the company has formalized work flow to avoid generational conflicts, said Maryella Gockel, the firm's flexibility strategy leader.
The process helps spread the workload in a more egalitarian way, she said, building flexibility for personal needs. "I'm a baby boomer, so for me, it's flexibility to respond if my 94-year-old mother needs me" — for others, it's getting to the gym or meeting the sitter, she said.
As for the work itself, Gockel recommends seeking younger workers' opinions, about a new technology initiative, for example, as a way to show your openness to new ideas.
"You have to be receptive to learning from people who are different from you," she said.

EU sanctions hit Russian oil companies  lawmakersPrint
Associated Press | Brussels | Posted: September 12, 2014 7:15 pm
New European Union sanctions against Russia announced on Friday toughen financial penalties on the country’s banks, arms makers and its biggest oil company, to punish Moscow for what the West sees as efforts to destabilize Ukraine.
The EU measures, details of which were released on Friday after a preliminary agreement on Thursday, broaden the scope of previous penalties. The United States was also expected to announce more sanctions on Friday.
The EU measures include:
- Further limits to some Russian companies’ ability to raise money in EU markets. The restrictions now apply not only to banks but also to major oil company Rosneft, defense companies, pipeline operator Transneft, the oil subsidiary of energy giant Gazprom and others.
- Broader limits on the export of high-technology EU goods that could also be used for military purposes.
- Travel bans and asset friezes for another 24 officials. They include four deputy Parliament speakers and leaders of the separatists in eastern Ukraine. Also hit is businessman Sergei Chemezov, who is one of President Vladimir Putin’s “close associates,” according to the EU.
- Bans for EU companies on new contracts in oil drilling, exploration and related services in Russia’s Arctic, deep sea and shale oil projects. Russia’s Rosneft oil company is majority-owned by the state, but Britain’s BP holds a 19.75 percent stake in it.
Conspicuously absent from the list was Russia’s gas industry, because many EU nations depend on Russian gas imports.
The measures are likely to hurt Russia’s already flagging economy.
“Even though (targeted) companies are not threatened with an immediate liquidity crisis, the banks and firms concerned will painfully notice, especially the stronger constraints for short-term refinancing,” said the managing director of the Association of German Banks, Michael Kemmer.

ET Special: All you want to know about Apple iPhone 6
Stock index provider MSCI Inc is considering changing its rules to allow shares of Alibaba Group Holding and other companies that list their shares in faraway markets to be included in its widely used indexes.
The MSCI announced that it was considering changing its rules last week, but did not explain the reason for the changes: questions from investors amid the Alibaba initial public offering, Reuters has learned from financial industry sources.
The investors argued that MSCI's ignoring stocks such as Alibaba prevents them from accurately tracking the performance of international companies, according to sources involved in the discussions, who wished to remain anonymous because they are not permitted to speak to the media.
Alibaba, a Chinese online retailer, plans to sell some $24 billion worth of shares next week on the New York Stock Exchange in a listing that could be the biggest ever IPO.
Under MSCI's rules, a company cannot be included in its biggest indexes if it is based in one region and its shares are listed in a different region. Because Alibaba is not listed anywhere in Asia and is listing in New York, it would be excluded from big MSCI indexes.
Any changes to the MSCI rules will probably have to wait until at least March 2015, according to a person familiar with the situation who declined to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media.
An MSCI spokeswoman declined to comment.
The rule changes under consideration could result in investors pouring billions of dollars into shares of companies like Alibaba and Chinese online search engine Baidu Inc.
Funds that track the performance of the MSCI Emerging Markets index and manage some $210 billion could be forced to buy Alibaba shares when the rules change. Funds with some $1.3 trillion in assets aim to duplicate the performance of the MSCI Global Investable Market indexes .
The top 30 companies by market value that could be added to MSCI indexes if rules change include besides Alibaba and Baidu, also Italian fashion company Prada SpA, which lists its shares in Hong Kong, and Samsonite International SA, a luggage company founded in the United States but listed in Hong Kong.
The total market value of those 30 companies, excluding Alibaba, is just over $410 billion. Alibaba's expected market value is $160 billion.
Under current rules, Alibaba does not qualify for inclusion in any major global indexes from any provider, although it does qualify for smaller indexes.
FUND PRESSURE
Institutional investors have also pressured another major international index provider, FTSE Group, to consider changing its rules to include companies that only list abroad, the sources said.
FTSE reiterated on Thursday that under its current rules, Alibaba would not be added to its Global Equity Index Series, which includes its well known FTSE Emerging Markets Index.
Those indexes exclude shares from companies that have American Depository Receipts on a US exchange, but no underlying listed shares in their local markets.

Pfizer  Ranbaxy win dismissal of antitrust lawsuit over generic LipitorPfizer, Ranbaxy win dismissal of antitrust lawsuit over generic Lipitor

(Pfizer, Ranbaxy won dismissal…)
Pfizer Inc and Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd on Friday won dismissal of an antitrust lawsuit accusing them of conspiring to delay sales of generic versions of the cholesterol drug Lipitor, the best-selling drug in history.
US District Judge Peter Sheridan in Trenton, New Jersey ruled that the plaintiffs, retailers and distribution companies that bought Lipitor directly from Pfizer, failed to plead their case with enough detail.
The lawsuit was filed in 2012 by retailers and distributors that bought Lipitor directly from Pfizer.
The lawsuit stems from a 2008 settlement of a patent lawsuit filed by Pfizer against Ranbaxy over Ranbaxy's plan to make generic Lipitor. Under the deal, Pfizer agreed to drop a claim for damages against Ranbaxy, and Ranbaxy agreed to stay out of the Lipitor market until November 2011.
Retailers and distribution companies claim that the settlement amounted to Pfizer paying Ranbaxy to stay out of the Lipitor market, violating antitrust laws. But Sheridan ruled Friday that their case failed because they did not offer any allegation of the settlement's dollar value.
Sheridan dismissed another version of the lawsuit last September.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs and a Pfizer spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment.
The case is In re: Lipitor Antitrust Litigation , U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey, No. 3:12-cv-02389.

Manmohan Singh could have stopped 2G scam: Former CAG Vinod Rai2G scam
(The thrust of ex-CAG Vinod…)
NEW DELHI: If former prime minister Manmohan Singh had reacted with greater alacrity to two letters sent by the then telecom minister A Raja in late 2007, the eventual decimation of the UPA government could have been averted along with the Rs 1.76 lakh crore 2G spectrum scam, former Comptroller and Auditor General of India Vinod Rai told ET.
Instead, Singh sent what Rai calls a template response to Raja's letters in November and December 2007. These letters outlined his plan of action for the issuance of 2G spectrum licences using the firstcome, first-served route. "I have received your letter regarding recent developments in the telecom sector," Singh wrote back on both occasions, the only difference being the date — November 21, 2007 and January 3, 2008.
"I have thought so much about this and asked several people but still don't know why such a routine response was sent to Raja. All the prime minister needed to do was ask the minister to bring the issue to the group of ministers on the subject and we could have stopped the scam in its tracks. It shows inadequate application of mind," Rai said.
In his book, Not Just An Accountant, released on Friday, Rai also highlights a remark made by Singh at the time the CAG was conducting a special audit of gas blocks allocated under the NELP, including the Krishna Godavari D-6 block operated by Reliance Industries Limited."Reliance is one of our largest, most respected and best-known companies with a global reach," Singh told Rai, adding that the ongoing audit shouldn't act as adampener on the private sector's enthusiasm to partner with the government.
Rai emphasised that the PM's remark on Reliance was not aimed at getting the auditor to go easy on the company."Singh genuinely believed that Reliance being an Indian company must be given some preferential treatment vis-a-vis foreign players.
The discussion was triggered when I told the PM that the production sharing contract must be reviewed as it is skewed in favour of the private players and not the government," the ex-CAG said. "Every time the operator (Reliance Industries Limited) made claims, it was acceded to by the management committee, director general of hydrocarbons or the ministry of petroleum and natural gas. Each time that it was acceded to, the action was detrimental to government interest," Rai concludes in the book.
This is just one of many intriguing interactions between Singh and Rai, who was blamed by Congress ministers for causing the policy paralysis in UPA-II.
In his no-holds-barred account, Rai has charged the UPA with actively fostering crony capitalism and taking no action to protect government interests across sectors -- oil, coal, spectrum, aviation and highways. "The buck stops with the PM, but this wasn't his failure alone.
The PM cannot be responsible for every small thing and depends on the information and analysis fed to him by secretaries and ministers," Rai said, adding that there were different reasons for each scam such as no cohesion between departments, missing leadership, rules being changed mid-way and lopsided contracts. All meetings between Singh and Rai were cordial and learning experiences, Rai has said in the book that he claimed he had no intention of writing when he retired in May 2013.
"After I retired, innuendos about my tenure and the CAG's office that is apolitical and competent, persisted. To call our younger officers untrained and incapable of performance audits was very unfair and I wanted to motivate the geNext who have lost their morale, within the CAG and in the country at large, to understand the flaws in our governance," he told ET.
The warmth between Singh and Rai evaporated on November 16, 2010 when the CAG completed 150 years. At the official function in Vigyan Bhawan that morning, Singh was visibly upset with Rai and voiced his disagreements with the CAG's conclusions in its report on 2G spectrum allocation.
The 2G scam report, that alleged a notional loss of Rs 1.76 lakh crore to the exchequer, had been presented to Parliament that day. Both Singh and then president Pratibha Patil regretted an invite for a reception at Rai's residence that evening.
Taking a big picture view on the issue that he believes is directly related to rising bad loans in public sector banks, Rai writes: "To some extent, such cronyism could have been overlooked, had the cronies actually delivered. Sadly, because they didn't, our infrastructure remains mired in controversy and burdened by financial difficulties."
"We have had examples of cronyism at its worst — with contracts being rigged, and 'cronies' being advised to bid at rates that ensure that their bids are winners. Once the bid is accepted, the saga of concessions starts," he writes.

Kittlaus threw out a scenario in which a flight is running late, causing a user to miss a connection. Viv might see this, and when the plane lands, the user already will be confirmed on the first flight the next morning and will have a room booked at the airport hotel with 24-hour room service.
"They have to think through every one of its use cases in advance," Kittlaus said of Siri and similar software. "Ours you can ask stuff, (and) once the system learns where to find those things, it can combine them in ways no one ever has thought to do … in combinations that nobody's ever thought of before.
"It evolves. People will add nodes to this, and everything in it becomes aware of each other and what it can do, and this model builds out. It will dynamically combine stuff. That's the beauty of it. There will be analytics around how much the brain knows, what it's smart about and what it isn't, what people are asking for that the brain doesn't yet know, which is an opportunity for people to step in."
Sometimes they may not even know they're stepping in. To showcase Viv's revolutionary software that writes its own programs, Kittlaus asked a Viv prototype to pick a wine to go with a particular dish. The question is parsed, and the program scripts its own strategy for how best to answer it, which network sources to consult.
"The guys who break down recipes into ingredients may never even know there's a wine recommendation service that their service might be contributing to, he said. "That's the beauty of this. One plus one doesn't equal two anymore. One plus one equals eight."
Siri users, even those who long ago stopped relying on it, will recall the simple pleasure of first seeing it do something unanticipated, its programming larded with little bytes of humanity and personality that helped you accept its occasional inability to understand what you wanted it to do or the realization it just wasn't going to do it.
In the end, what separates us from our technology is the ability to feel and our acute awareness that we risk failure in anything we try. It's that vulnerability that makes us appreciate true brilliance and all the forms it takes in ways that no artificial intelligence will ever comprehend.
"Anybody will tell you," Williams said, "the laughter is one thing, but when you really find something, there's another buzz that's higher."

Chicago misses out in AbbVie-Calico pharma deal1
Compare that to Calico and AbbVie's privately funded effort, which, if all goes well, will amount to a $1.5 billion investment.
The mayor's office didn't even know such a project was in play, even though one of AbbVie's board members serves on the board of World Business Chicago, which is supposed to be this city's corporate cheerleader-in-chief.
"AbbVie and Google have not discussed their plans with us," said David Roeder, a spokesman for the state's economic development agency. "As publicly traded companies, they have to be careful about disclosure of pending deals. News accounts indicate they plan to build in California. We are eager to discuss with them opportunities in Illinois."
Biotech is a Bay Area strength, but the region hasn't dominated the health care industry in the way it has the software and computing world. That is changing.
"The reality is that we're seeing the consumerization of health care," said Glen Tullman, the former Allscripts chief executive, whose Chicago-based 7wire Ventures invests in health care technology companies. "If you look at every other industry, the consumerization of those industries has by and large been led out of Silicon Valley. There's a lot of talent out there that understands how to take everything from a basic service or an iPhone and apply them to health care."
Data prepared by accounting firm EY for an industry trade group show that as of 2011, the biotech industry employed 230,177 people in California and 81,115 in Illinois. Research and development expenditures in 2010 in California amounted to $4.7 billion and in Illinois to $608 million.
Irrational loons will say the imbalance is all because Illinois is corrupt! We're overtaxed! Take away those government employee pensions!
More rational people will say this new facility is going to California because Google, its initial funder, is there.
Not quite.
According to a source, this facility will be built in the Bay Area because Calico's CEO, Arthur Levinson, previously led Genentech, a pioneer in genetic engineering based in South San Francisco. Calico's president of research and development, Hal Barron, also worked with Levinson at Genentech.
The talent Google coveted was in its backyard. Why?
Genentech was founded in 1976 by venture capitalist Robert Swanson and biochemist Herbert Boyer. A job transfer for Swanson from New York to San Francisco and an assistant professorship for Boyer at the University of California at San Francisco placed them in the same city.
That was so long ago that when Swanson reached out to Boyer about starting a company based on DNA-related technology, Boyer didn't even know what a venture capitalist was.
It's an unsexy explanation. But a chain of events that began almost 40 years ago — with one innovation begetting more innovation — is what has caused Chicago to miss out on this $1.5 billion opportunity.
It's a cycle that will be difficult to reverse.

Deportations in US down by 20 per cent, fewest since 2007

(Obama has quietly slowed…)
WASHINGTON: President Barack Obama has quietly slowed deportations by nearly 20 per cent while delaying plans to act on his own potentially to shield millions of immigrants from expulsion.
The Homeland Security Department is on pace to remove the fewest number of immigrants since 2007, according to an analysis of its data by The Associated Press.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal agency responsible for deportations, sent home 258,608 immigrants between the start of the budget year last Oct. 1 and July 28 this summer, a decrease of nearly 20 per cent from the same period in 2013, when 320,167 people were removed.
Over 10 months in 2012, Immigration and Customs Enforcement deported 344,624 people, some 25 per cent more than this year, according to federal figures obtained by the AP.
Obama announced plans earlier this year to act on his own to slow deportations but now has postponed any changes until after November's elections. The delay is an effort to shield vulnerable Democrats from potential voter ire at his unilateral actions.
The removal figures, contained in weekly internal reports marked "Official Use Only," reflect the marked decline in deportations even as Obama has delayed announcing what changes he will make to US immigration policies.
Immigration advocates widely expect Obama to reduce the number of immigrants who are deported, a particularly sensitive issue in many states. Since Obama took office, his administration has removed more than 2.1 million immigrants.
There are two principal reasons fewer immigrants already are being deported:
The Obama administration decided as early as summer 2011 to focus its deportation efforts on criminal immigrants or those who posed a threat to national security or public safety. Many others who crossed into the United States illegally or overstayed their visas and could be subject to deportation are stuck in a federal immigration court system. Last month the backlog in that system exceeded 400,000 cases for the first time, according to court data analyzed by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. For each case, it now takes several years for a judge to issue a final order to leave the US
As Border Patrol agents detain more people from countries in Central America, not Mexico, the volume and circumstances of the cases take more time for overwhelmed immigration officials and courts to process because, among other reasons, the US must fly such immigrants home rather than letting them walk back across the border into Mexico. A surge in the number of immigrant families, mostly women and young children, has swamped temporary holding facilities, leading the Homeland Security Department to release many people into the US interior with instructions to report back to authorities later.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the decrease reflected the president's decision to shift resources from the interior of the country to the border to address the surge in unaccompanied minors arriving on the border.
  "The shifting of those resources may have something to do with those numbers," Earnest said, adding that law enforcement officials make deportation decisions independent of the White House.
Under US law, immigrant children from Central America caught crossing the border alone can't be subjected to speedy removal proceedings without appearing before a judge. The government interviews Mexican and Canadian children to make sure they aren't trafficking victims; then they can be sent home quickly.
The administration instructed immigration officials starting in summer 2011 to prioritize deportation cases involving criminal immigrants. Deportations had been increasing since late 2008, but since that summer the overall number has dropped markedly.
It remains unclear exactly what actions Obama will announce after the elections. He said earlier this month the US would be better off if immigrants who in some cases, he said, have been in the US for longer than 10 years and have American children "have a path to get legal by paying taxes and getting aboveboard, paying a fine, learning English if they have to."

European Union's Joaquin Almunia denies decision on Google was postponed to appease lobbyists

(Almunia hit back at media…)
BRUSSELS: Europe's antitrust chief hit back on Friday at media reports suggesting that he had bowed to political lobbying by delaying a final decision on alleged anti-competitive behaviour by Google.
European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in May that he wanted to close the case against the world's most popular internet search engine before the end of his five-year term, but he announced this week that he would not be able to do so before he stands down next month, leaving his successor to take over.
Almunia had previously indicated that he intended to accept concessions offered by the company in February in a proposed deal that attracted heavy criticism from rivals such as Microsoft, a host of smaller competitors across Europe and some EU lawmakers.
Speaking at a conference in New York on Friday, Almunia defended the delay by insisting that Google , under fire for allegedly promoting its own services at rivals' expense, needs to improve its proposal to settle the investigation without a fine, which could be as high as $5 billion.
"This case has generated many opinions, letters, statements, even campaigns," he said. "However, the only arguments we have taken into account were those included in the complainants' answers whenever they challenged the adequacy of Google's proposals."
Almunia also said he had not set a deadline for his decision, in contrast to his comments in May. "I have never linked the date of a decision to the duration of my mandate," he said.
Almunia will hand the case to his successor, former Danish economy minister Margrethe Vestager, who takes up her post in November. She will now have to decide whether to continue settlement talks with Google, charge the company or drop the case.

(Morgan Stanley remains…)
NEW YORK: Morgan Stanley remains the world's biggest seller of managed accounts, in which customers pay a fee rather than trade-based commissions to have their assets managed, but it is phasing out a program that lets them choose among more than 300 actively managed mutual funds for their investments.
As of July 1, the firm closed TRAK Fund Solution to new investors, saying they have better and more flexible opportunities in other fee-based programs that include the funds in TRAK. Existing customers can remain, but about 40 per cent of their assets have moved since the company told its more than 17,000 brokers of the plan to shrink in May, said James Tracy, who runs Morgan Stanley's Consulting Group Wealth Advisory Solutions.
"People are doing much more sophisticated things with their portfolios" than investing only in mutual funds, he said.
The move comes as major US brokerage firms are tweaking their fast-growing managed account platforms to better unify pricing and reduce paperwork. Bank of America Corp's Merrill Lynch wealth management unit, for example, is merging more than five managed programs into a single Merrill One platform by the end of next year.
Consolidation riles some brokers who have to explain the changes to clients, but the firms say improved managed account technology makes it easier for brokers to monitor client portfolios, reduce paperwork and spend more time servicing clients and meeting new prospects.
It also allows brokerage firms to standardize fees and discount limits across programs, whether customers invest on their own, give full discretion to a broker or use model portfolios created by a firm.
Merrill One, for example, uses a single billing and fee process no matter how many management programs are used. Morgan Stanley expects to make some changes in its discounting and fee policies over the next two years, but will not announce anything until its budget process is complete by yearend, Tracy said.
TRAK Fund Solution was created in 1994 at Smith Barney, which Morgan Stanley purchased in full last year. Together with a companion program in which Morgan Stanley gets a management fee, TRAK had $34.7 billion of assets as of June 30, according to Cerulli Associates. The companion program remains open to new investors.
Mutual fund advisory programs surpass all other types with $1 trillion of assets as of June 30. But they are more popular at discount brokerages and regional firms that focus on less affluent investors than do larger firms such as Morgan Stanley and Merrill.
Those firms rank first and second respectively in total managed assets with a combined market share of 35 per cent, or $1.3 trillion, but are ninth and tenth in mutual fund-only assets, according to Cerulli.
The biggest managed fund sponsors are Fidelity Investments , Ameriprise Financial and Edward Jones, with a 39 per cent share among them.

(Australian DJ Melanie Greig,…)
LONDON: One of the two Australian DJs, who made a hoax call to a London hospital about Kate Middleton's first pregnancy, today tearfully apologised to the family of an India-born nurse who committed suicide after the broadcast of the prank.
Jacintha Saldanha , found hanged at a London hospital in 2012 days after receiving the hoax call from an Australian radio station about the Duchess of Cambridge's first pregnancy, committed suicide, an inquest into her death has concluded.
One of the 2Day FM DJs, Melissa Greig , apologised to Saldanha's family at the inquest, tearfully telling them, "I'm truly sorry, I have wanted to say that for so long."
After the coroner had given her conclusion, Grieg said through her lawyer that she wished to make a statement.
In tears, she apologised to Saldanha's family and to the other nurse, saying: "This tragedy is always going to stay with me as a constant reminder."
"To the second nurse involved, I am so deeply sorry for what you have had to endure. I pray you have found the strength to live on as best you can. I was always concerned about the wellbeing of both nurses and I wish I'd tried harder to stop that prank from being aired," Greig said.
Greig was in court for a second day despite not being called as a witness.
Saldanha, originally from Mangalore in Karnataka, was found dead in the nursing accommodation of King Edward VII hospital days after staff were tricked into revealing details of Kate's pregnancy to two Australian radio DJs -- Greig and Michael Christian -- posing as Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles back in December 2012.
The 46-year-old mother of two had answered the call and transferred it on to the duty nurse on the Duchess of Cambridge's ward.
Saldanha later wrote to the nurse, who had been looking after the Duchess on the night of the prank, to apologise for putting the call through to her.

NEW YORK: Hewlett-Packard Co is exploring the sale of its web-based photo sharing service Snapfish, and has held discussions with multiple private equity and industry buyers, a person with knowledge of the situation said.
Snapfish, which HP bought for more than $300 million in 2005 and currently sits within its printing and personal systems group, is considered non-core for the company, the person said, asking not to be named because the matter is not public.
A spokesman for HP declined to comment.
Last year, HP replaced the printing and personal business' long-time head Todd Bradley with former Lenovo executive Dion Weisler . Bradley has since left the technology company, to join Tibco Software Inc as its president.
Some of the parties that have been eyeing Snapfish have also expressed interest in buying another online photo-sharing services provider, Shutterfly Inc, the person said.
Shutterfly hired Frank Quattrone's Qatalyst Partners over the summer to find a buyer, and is expected wrap up its process in the next several weeks, people familiar with the matter have said previously.

Difficult to do business in India: Marten Pieterstelecommunication service
World’s second largest telecom firm Vodafone, which is facing taxation issues in India, on Thursday, said it was difficult for foreign companies to do business in the country because of slower government clearances.
Vodafone India head Marten Pieters said the company had sought government’s approval in December last to bring in funds from the parent company to buy airwaves but the clearance was still awaited.
“Yes, it is difficult to do business in India, that’s the general perception I think of foreign companies and that is not just in telecom,” he said speaking at Economist India Summit here.
The British telecom major is facing a tax liability of over Rs.11,200 crore, along with interest, on its 2007 acquisition of Honk Kong-based Hutchison Whampoa’s stake in India’s telecom major Hutchison Essar. He, however, added that the process for doing business in India “can be made much easier, much smoother by just removing a few things.”
On spectrum auctions due in February 2015 and raising equity for it, Mr. Pieters said: “I have no answer, I got to know last week that the officer dealing with the file has retired.” He said the telecom industry in India was in a mess and it was a result of thinking that more the competition the better it was, Mr. Pieters said.

The model contract agreement on public-private partnership mode for developing Coal India mines is in the final stage of approval.
"In consonance to the policy of GoI (Government of India) and further production capabilities of CIL, it has now been decided to work some of the mines of CIL through PPP mode. The model Contract Agreement (MCA) is in the final stage of approval by CIL board of directors," Coal India said in a report.
Under the public private partnership (PPP) model, the mine operator will develop and operate the mine, CIL said, adding that the contract will be for 15 years initially and the operators shall carry all the activities as per the approved project report of the block.
The government had earlier said that an explored green-field coal mine in Mahanadi coalfields is being taken up as a pilot project under PPP and the model concession agreement has been prepared by the Planning Commission for further discussions.
Coal India Ltd (CIL) board had earlier also discussed about concession agreement pertaining to PPP model.
The previous government had said there was a need to devise a policy on public-private framework with CIL as one of its partners to reduce the country's increasing dependence on imported coal.
CIL, which accounts for over 80 percent of the domestic coal output, missed the production target last fiscal and produced only 462 million tonnes (MT) of coal in 2013-14 as against the target of 482 MT.
Coal import increased by 17.9 percent to 171 million tonnes (mt) in 2013-14. Coal import was 145 million tonnes in 2012-13.

Ahead of Modi visit  V K Singh holds  grievance redressal meet  for NE communityPrint
Written by Lakshmi Ajay | Gandhinagar | Posted: September 12, 2014 9:23 pm
Just days before the impending visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping to Gujarat, Gen (Retd) V K Singh, the Union Minister in charge of North East Region, held an informal grievance ‘redressal meet’ of people hailing from the six states of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Mizoram, Tripura and Manipur who are based in Gujarat, on Friday.
Singh met close to 50 members of North-Eastern community including students, professionals and homemakers in the lobby of the Gujarat National Law University’s guest facility, which was not open to the media.
Outlining his vision for the N-E states, the Minister during his opening remarks promised 2000 MW of power via clean energy to the six states of North East by way of rural electrification, an AIIMS-like institution, skill development centers and speedy road and infrastructure development.
“Things will take time, you have to trust us. In six states, clean energy will be harnessed which is not dependent on coal or gas but will be based on solar power. Rainwater harvesting measures will also be initiated. There is a World Bank funded Rural Livelihood Mission which is dormant now but we plan to make it work soon,” he told the students.
The Minister was in Gandhinagar to flag off GNLU’s two day “India’s Foreign Relations – Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean: Strengthening the Political, Economic, Security and Cultural Prospects” where he was Chief Guest, before he met with members of the NE community. He was accompanied by Sunil Deodhar, the Poll Manager for Narendra Modi’s Varanasi campaign, Sunil Trivedi who is part of BJP’s state election management wing and Rajendra Singh Chandel, the National co-convenor of BJP North East cell.
Speaking at the conference Singh had outlined issues of illegal trafficking of drugs, people, illegal fishing into Indian waters, illegal survey of Indian areas in a bid to start mining operations as issues that were being adressed by the new government’s ‘proactive foreign policy’.
“A new separate hostel for people of North Eastern region will be started at Jawaharlal Nehru University soon, which will be extended to all other metros soon. This hostel will be for our own people so that it becomes slightly easier for them to stay…. We know there are issues in Assam, for which we will find a solution.
While there is a small problem in Mizoram which will become big in the coming days, which is of China people coming to work at households and then staying on. Policies will be made so that things do not become illegal. If the regime becomes such, then illegal people can be take care of and identification can be done… The purpose of meeting with all of you is that you must go back home and tell your people that things are being done and that this much money is coming,” he said.
Outlining the meet as one to address grievances, Singh took questions from more than eight people in the meeting. Sunep C Jamir continued…

The Centre’s letter to the state in this regard appears to be a move towards the implementation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Digital India’ mission.
The Centre has recently written to the Uttarakhand government to consider implementing the proposed scheme which the Expert Committee on HR policy for e-Governance has recommended. The panel was set up in pursuance of the decision of the Prime Minister’s Committee on the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP).
“The scheme is suggestive and it would be for respective state governments to consider adapting the scheme depending on their requirements,” R S Sharma, Secretary in the Union IT Ministry, has communicated to the Uttarakhand’s Chief Secretary Subhash Kumar in his letter.
At a meeting on September 8, Kumar discussed the issues relating to setting up of a virtual IT cadre with the senior officials of the state’s IT department. He has directed the authorities concerned to select at least three resource persons from each government department to ensure maximum use of IT for “good governance”.
As per the suggested scheme for virtual IT e-Governance cadre for states/UTs, the officers for the cadre should be selected from the existing state government employees.
There is also a proposal for the mission mode project (MMP) — a project within the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP) that focuses on one aspect of e-Governance, such as banking, land records or commercial taxes. “Full time mission leaders may be appointed for implementation of IT projects with outlays greater than Rs 50 crore. The mission leaders shall work exclusively for implementation of e-Governance mission mode project. They shall be part of state virtual IT e-Governance cadre,” said the suggested scheme.
About 2-5 per cent of the existing strength of officers and staff at different levels could be selected into virtual cadre. The scheme made it clear that percentages are only indicative and the state governments may decide the category of posts and also decide on the number/percentages.

No dates yet for Jharkhand and J&K
Haryana and Maharashtra, States under Congress-led governments for 10 and 15 years respectively, will hold elections on October 15, with counting of votes on October 19, as per the schedule announced by the Election Commission on Friday. The term of the Haryana Assembly comes to an end in October and in Maharashtra it ends in November.
In May, the Congress had won just one of the 10 Lok Sabha seats in Haryana while the BJP won seven. In Maharashtra, of the 48 Lok Sabha constituencies, the Congress-NCP alliance won only six, while the BJP-Shiv Sena combine won 42, indicating strong anti-incumbency mood in both States.
Announcing the schedule, Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) V.S. Sampath, said the model code of conduct comes into effect immediately. It would also be applicable to the Central Government in the case of policies and announcements related to the poll-bound States.
The schedule for the Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) and Jharkhand Assembly elections will be announced later as the terms of the assemblies will end only in January 2015.
With J&K dealing with a devastating flood situation, Mr. Sampath added that the Commission was closely watching the situation and a decision would be taken once a clearer picture emerged. An EC official told The Hindu that the J&K polls will be spread over at least five phases, if not seven as in the last Assembly elections in 2008 and the entire process would take over two months to complete. “All accounted, the EC has time till November first week to take a call,” the official said.

Delhi BJP chief hints no action against Dagar in AAP sting#sher singh dagar #delhi #aap #bjp #sting #bribe #delhi elections
New Delhi: Delhi BJP chief Satish Upadhyay on Friday said he was "satisfied" with the explanation provided by vice-president Sher Singh Dagar in connection with the AAP sting case while dropping hints that no action will be taken against him.
Upadhyay, however, issued another notice to Dagar asking him what legal action he is taking in this connection. Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal on September 8 accused Dagar of offering a bribe of Rs 4 crore to one of its MLAs for switching sides against the backdrop of government formation moves in the capital.
Delhi BJP chief Upadhyay had slapped a show cause notice seeking his explanation in the wake of the allegations."Today, we received his clarification on AAP's sting. In his reply, Dagar has reiterated mostly things what he had already put before the media in his defence. Dagar in his explanation clarified that one and a half months ago, he (AAP MLA) met him and requested him to make him join BJP. He had also shown interest to contest elections on a BJP's ticket",Upadhyay told reporters.
Delhi BJP chief Upadhyay had slapped a show cause notice seeking his explanation in the wake of the allegations.
Upadhyay said, "In his reply, Dagar explained that the sting is totally fabricated. However, we have asked him what legal action --whether he is going to file an FIR or file defamation case -- he he planning in the case. I have asked him that he has to prove his stand."
Asked whether he was satisfied with Dagar's clarification, Upadhyay said, "Yes, I was satisfied, but what I have told him that since incident took place at your home and nobody had authorised you (Dagar). He said that he has not done anything like that."
The Delhi BJP chief also said that the party has asked him to file his explanation within the next one week. "We have asked him to prove his stand on these allegations so that the party's image is not compromised," he added.
On September 8, Aam Aadmi Party Chief Arvind Kejriwal had claimed at a press conference that AAP MLA from Sangam Vihar, Dinesh Mohania, was offered Rs 4 crore by Delhi BJP Vice President Sher Singh Dagar to quit the party.
Dagar had totally denied the allegations and claimed that he was being framed. "If any charge is proved against me, I would quit politics in which I had been there for the last 44 years," Dagar had told reporters at his residence.

Over 1 lakh Maha voters whose names were deleted re-registered#maharashtra #voters #elections
Mumbai: More than a lakh voters whose names figured in the "deleted voters" list during Lok Sabha polls in Maharashtra have registered afresh for the October 15 Maharashtra state assembly polls, official sources said.
The total number fresh voters who registered after Lok Sabha polls is more than 22 lakh, Maharashtra state Chief Electoral Officer Nitin Gadre told reporters.
The Election Commission will also use voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT), a method to provide feedback to voters, in select constituencies, Gadre said.
The poll process would be completed by October 22, Gadre said.
Of the more than 8.26 crore voters in Maharashtra, around 4.36 crore voters are males, while 3.89 crore voters are female, the bureaucrat said. Those wishing to enroll as voters could do so by
September 17, Gadre said.
"We are using post-2006 electronic voting machines and I can assure you that there won't be any glitches," Gadre said, responding to a query about objections raised by some political leaders since the machines were procured from Gujarat.
The notification will be issued on September 20, while the last date of filing papers is September 27 and scrutiny will be on September 29.
The last date for withdrawal of candidature is October 1. Polling will be on October 15 and counting will be on October 19.
The poll process would be completed by October 22, Gadre said.

Bypolls for 33 assembly  3 Lok Sabha seats today; spotlight on UPBypolls for 33 assembly, 3 Lok Sabha seats today; spotlight on UP
Saubhadra Chatterji , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, September 12, 2014
First Published: 17:28 IST(12/9/2014) | Last Updated: 04:03 IST(13/9/2014)
Comments
The results of Saturday’s by-elections for three Lok Sabha and 33 assembly seats may not alter any ruling political equation in the states or the Centre, but they will be an indicator of the popularity of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and opposition parties ahead of four assembly elections likely by the end of the year.
They also pose a key question on the future of the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in Uttar Pradesh.
The BJP swept to power on the back of a so-called Modi wave this summer, but failed to maintain the momentum in last month’s by-elections in four states where it lost a majority of seats to the Congress party and its allies.
The BJP and its allies together won only eight of the 18 seats that went to the polls while the Congress and its allies won 10.
This time around, political pundits are looking to see which way the wind blows in the Saturday bypolls spread across Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Assam, Gujarat, Tripura, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Sikkim.
 
The results of two Lok Sabha seats — Vadodara which was vacated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Medak in Telangana — are unlikely to throw any surprises. But Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav’s prestige is at stake in his home turf Mainpuri, the third Lok Sabha seat.
Read: Irrespective of result, Mainpuri poised to script electoral history
 
In the last Lok Sabha polls, a large number of OBCs and Dalits rallied behind the BJP across the Hindi belt. The shift dented the SP and BSP’s support base in the largest electoral state. The SP won just seven seats while Mayawati’s BSP drew a blank.
 
The grand alliance of the RJD-JDU-Congress could halt the BJP’s charge into this caste base. In the absence of such an alliance in Uttar Pradesh, any further losses may lead to an existential crisis for the two caste-based parties.
 
If the opposition parties -- especially the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress in Rajasthan, Gujarat and Assam -- can stop the BJP’s march, their claim about the Modi wave waning will receive a further boost.

With elections in Maharashtra and Haryana due next month, any by-election victory will also give the beleaguered Congress a fresh face saver after its humiliating Lok Sabha defeat.
 
But it may not be so easy for the opposition. Of the 33 seats, 11 are in Uttar Pradesh where the BJP swept 71 of 80 Lok Sabha seats.
In Gujarat and Rajasthan, where 13 assembly seats are up for grabs, the opposition could not even open its account in the general election.
Three seats are heading for the polls in Congress-ruled Assam where the BJP bagged 50% of Lok Sabha constituencies.

In West Bengal, the ruling Trinamool Congress will be desperate to win both seats as it wants to show that the Saradha scam has not hurt the party’s prospects.
For the BJP, a win or even a number two position in the results from Assam and Bengal will further cement its position as a fast emerging force, replacing traditional opposition parties like AGP and Left, respectively.
The by-elections in Chhattisgarh, Sikkim, Andhra and Tripura will test if the ruling parties can further consolidate their positions. Tripura is the only state where the Left is in power.

Fusion foods make a mark as dessert a play k...Fusion foods make a mark as dessert play key role in restaurant menu

As per National Restaurant Association of India, Indian food services industry has seen a steady growth in past few years & will grow in next 5 years.
ET SPECIAL:
ET Special: All you want to know about Apple iPhone 6
NEW DELHI: Ever imagined pairing Rooh Afza with creme brulee? Or gooey marshmallows oozing out of an olden-day classic, chinni ki roti, or even a gaajar ka halwa with goat cheese? Gone are the days of fruit salad with ice cream — as India's restaurant culture evolves, chefs are getting creative with dessert, and with good reason.
It accounts for a good quarter of revenue at some outlets. The traditional is being informed by the modern. Here's a tasting menu of sweet things — molecular phirni-oxide, a Parle-G cheesecake, jalebi cavier, rasmalai tres leches and apple cinnamon jalebis.
Such concoctions garnished with a hint of molecular gastronomy are being eagerly ordered in restaurants across the country. Chefs are taking fusion food up a notch by experimenting with Indian desserts as the business expands.
According to the National Restaurant Association of India , the Indian food services industry has seen a steady growth in the past few years and is expected to grow at over 11 per cent in the next five years.
Right now the size of the industry is approximately Rs 2.5 trillion and is projected to reachRs 4.1 trillion by 2018. And one of the key factors propelling restaurant growth will be experimentation with new formats, themes and menus by innovative, entrepreneurial ventures, according to the association.
As the average food bill rises, dessert is playing a key role. Riyaaz Amlani's new restaurant Social Offline serves a fried chocolate bar, Ramesh Suresh. Manish Mehrortra's much-feted Indian Accent in Delhi is dishing out traditional desserts in a modern avatar—Gujarati suterfeni, rose chikki, home-made pistachio ice cream or the raw and ripe mango daulat ki chaat with mango candy brittle are all runaway successes.Rahul Akerkar, founder of Degustibus Hospitality, which owns the Indigo chain of restaurants, said close to 25 per cent of revenue comes from desserts. That follows since prices have gone up with the makeover and, more importantly, customers are happy to pay. Gulab jamuns can cost up to Rs 600 for a portion at some restaurants.
"Yes there is certainly a demand in the market for innovative food and these desserts fall in this category," said Akerkar. The chef created halwa creme brulee with goat cheese at Indigo and a mille-feuille with shrikhand and berries. But he emphasises that chefs should be careful they don't make a "khichdi" out of dessert. It's an interesting time to be an Indian patron, according to owners.
"There was a time when desserts were relegated to the last page of a menu," said restaurateur Zorawar Kalra , founder of Massive Restaurants. But "the kind of modern Indian desserts we are doing tend to leave a final memory for people to return to us."He's working on the concept of a mithai takeaway that should debut before the end of the year. "It's about time the Indian dessert arrives, and there is limitless potential in this concept," he said, particularly since only one in three people have dessert, according to restaurateurs.
Delhi-based Mehrotra of Indian Accent looks to British culinary alchemist Heston Blumenthal for inspiration. He's reinventing simple classics such as chini ki roti (literally sugar bread) with marshmallows besides doing a besan laddoo tart served with a side of 'mithai' cheesecake."Indian cuisine will boom again and it's time it comes out of the closet. We need a little modern twist with our traditional foods," said Mehrotra. Prices are reasonable at Delhi's Cafe Lota— apple cinnamon jalebi with coconut rabri and bhapa doi cheesecake comes for Rs 125 a plate.
Pastry chef Kishi Arora, who owns baking company Foodaholics, said spending power and experimentation have risen significantly and customers want to try fun Indian things that have been created by playing around with international techniques.
"Recently, a customer asked me to bake a New York style cheesecake with red chilli powder and chunda (raw mango chutney). So, I made little cupcakes out of them and the Gujarati clients were floored," said Arora. Her cakes are priced upward of Rs 3,000 per kilo and that includes crossover desserts.

Tells Jewish donors the U.S. "is on the right side of history"
U.S. President Barack Obama cast the worldwide campaign he’s leading to destroy the Islamic State group on Friday as part of a broader effort to root out extremism within the Muslim world, telling Jewish donors the U.S. “is on the right side of history”.
At a fundraiser for Senate Democrats in Baltimore, Mr. Obama said he was confident that Islamic State militants would eventually be defeated, thanks in part to a more inclusive Iraqi government and the broad coalition that Mr. Obama is seeking to assemble.
Yet he also said the crisis in the Middle East, while terrible, has a silver lining.
“It’s focussed attention, I think, for the first time in a long time in the Muslim world about the need to completely distance from and ultimately stomp out this particular brand of Islamic extremism that really has no place in the 21st century,” Mr. Obama said.
Mr. Obama’s pitch to donors, usually upbeat and economically focused as the midterm elections grow near, took on a more somber tone than usual on Friday, two days after the president gave a prime-time address announcing a major expansion of the U.S. military effort in the Middle East, including airstrikes for the first time in Syria.
Mr. Obama didn’t mention Israel or the fragile ceasefire between Israel’s government and Hamas. But Howard E. Friedman, a former president of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), who quoted from the Torah, as he introduced the president, thanked Mr. Obama for recognising that the prospect of a nuclear Iran poses the greatest danger to the U.S. Israel considers Iran’s nuclear ambitions an existential threat, and the U.S. and other world powers are in negotiations to scale back Iran’s nuclear programme.
The president has been raising money at a rapid pace throughout the summer for Democratic political committees as his party seeks to maintain its fragile Senate majority. Mr. Obama told donors that the U.S. has made progress and is poised to grow even more, if voters side with Democrats who he said are pursuing a vision of expanded opportunity.
“We are the envy of the world, but in order to actually, fully realise that potential we’ve got to have a government that works,” Mr. Obama said.

Tribune reporter
CME chairman explains the need for speed
Why higher interest rates might be a good thing
Is the stock market really “rigged” by high-frequency traders and others? CME boss has an answer.
Terry Duffy came of age as a futures trader in the deafening roar of the trading pits where people in brightly colored jackets jostled and sometimes fought for prime spaces.
Brawn has since been replaced by those with the fastest Internet connections, as electronic trading has nearly eliminated open-outcry markets in the past two decades. Duffy, executive chairman and president of Chicago-based CME Group, credits computerized trading for helping the company become the world's largest futures market.
Increasingly, high-frequency traders are using sophisticated computer programs to move rapidly in and out of stocks and futures to capture fleeting shifts in prices. They have a number of critics, including author Michael Lewis, who in his new book, "Flash Boys," argues that the stock market is "rigged" by a cabal of high-frequency traders, stock exchanges and Wall Street firms.
  Open link
In an interview at his Wacker Drive office, Duffy, who read the book, said Lewis' allegation is a stretch, but he also echoes the author's descriptions of structural problems with the stock market. He talked as well about the slump in trading volumes, his outlook for interest rates and the governance of the CME Group.
Questions and answers have been edited for space and clarity:
Q: What do you think of "Flash Boys"?
A: He's stating a few things that appear that there's front-running (an illegal practice of a trader executing orders on a security with advance knowledge of other people's orders). I say that's a function of fragmentation of the U.S. equity markets that was created by the equity markets themselves. In the U.S. equity markets, there are 17 different exchanges and several different dark pools of liquidity. I've been saying for years that there's problems with the structure of U.S. equity markets. I don't say it's rigged.
The equity market has been able to create not just wealth, but given people the opportunity to create liquidity, to create jobs and to expand their businesses.
Q: How much high-frequency trading is there on the CME's exchanges?
A: It's hard to quantify. We have estimated around 30 to 35 percent of the average daily volume is done by high-frequency trading. In our world, nobody knows your order is in there but you until it hits the order book. When you place an order in CME's Globex system, it doesn't go bouncing around. It comes right into our proprietary system. (Traders) can't see it going through the pipes of our business.
Q: The CME sells the right to locate one's computer server inside the exchange's data center (known as co-location) to receive market data. What do you say to critics who argue that this is preferential treatment to high-frequency traders?
0
A: We offer co-location to everybody. Let's make sure we're clear on this. Market data is sent out at the same time. You might receive it faster than your competitor depending on what your needs are. Everybody can have it at the same speed if they want it. There's no secret deals with anybody.
I can't control someone that's willing to pay more to get it faster. It's up to them how they want to receive it. You say here's one flat fee. Everyone gets the information at the same time? That's a socialist system isn't it?
Q: Some might say that's a fair system.
A: There's different prices for everything we do in life, and we're not any different. I don't want to try to defend the capitalist system because that's what it is.
Q: Why are trading volumes weak across a number of assets?
A: People are waiting to see what's going to happen geopolitically. I think that's one of the reasons we're seeing stagnation in a lot of the asset classes throughout the world. The other issue is the U.S. equity market is sitting at all-time highs and nobody is in it.
Traders have positions on the books at record levels today, but they are not trading them because they are waiting to see what's going to happen. They are hedged up, but the markets aren't moving, so they are just leaving those hedges on.
Q: How have lower volumes affected the CME?
A: Eighty percent of our revenue is derived by transactions. You have to be more cost-effective and cost-efficient to offset lower volumes. Unfortunately, that puts a strain on hiring. If your business is hitting a wall, it's hard to continue to hire.
Q: Low interest rates are also being blamed for the slump in trading. What's your outlook on interest rates?
A: We believe we are going to see a more normalized rate environment. The question is what is a more normalized rate environment? Is it historical like 5 or 6 percent, or is it something new we haven't seen yet? I think a more normalized rate environment today would look more like 1 to 3 percent.
Q: The Federal Reserve recently said that it foresaw rates staying low for a considerable time after quantitative easing ends. Is the Fed being overly cautious?
A: I think they are being overly cautious. That's not healthy for baby boomers. They have a tremendous amount of wealth, but they are afraid of the equity markets, and the government gives them nothing on Treasuries. I think a normalized-rate environment would be better for the economy. You can allow those people to start spending returns they get and put that into the economy.
Q: Why did the CME raise the transaction fees for nearly all its major products in January?
A: Our fees are very low. We have costs associated with running the business. We were looking at the ratio of fees to the services we were offering and decided the price was a little bit low. It was nothing that impacted the clients dramatically that would cause any volume changes.
Q: You have an unusual management arrangement in that you're the chairman and president. How do you divide responsibilities with Chief Executive Phupinder Gill?
A: My position's evolved into more hands-on because the CME's gotten so big. I want Gill focused on the business. I'm very focused in dealing with the Wall Street banks.
I've taken over all the communications and messaging of the company, which is extremely important. There's been a whole host of issues that has hit this business in the last five years that would make your head spin that most businesses couldn't recover from. I also take care of all regulatory issues.
Q: What are your plans?
A: I just signed a new four-year contract in January. I have no interest in leaving before then.
Q: Gov. (Pat) Quinn gave the CME millions of dollars in tax breaks in 2011 aimed at keeping the company in Chicago. Will you vote for him in the next election?
A: I don't know who I'm going to vote for yet.

Gas tax woes: Roads may crumble as people go green14
The changes in how people are traveling is not good news for Illinois' crumbling infrastructure. Illinois received a C- rating on the 2014 infrastructure report card from the American Society of Civil Engineers. For roads, the state got a D+, with the society claiming that 42 percent of Illinois' major roads are in "poor or mediocre condition."
"Funding sources must be supplemented with a long term sustainable funding source at the state and federal level. Illinois' poor roads will continue to hinder the State's ability to spur economic growth and build sustainable, efficient communities," the report said.
Efforts to increase funding by adjusting the way taxes are levied have not worked, according to IDOT.
In 2013, the Transportation for Illinois Coalition proposed eliminating the state motor fuel tax and replacing it with a combination of taxes on the wholesale price of fuel and other registration fees. The bill didn't move forward.
In 2014, the same coalition proposed keeping the motor fuel tax but diverting the state's share of the sales tax (80 percent of the 6.25 percent rate goes to the state; the remainder is split between local governments) from the state's general fund and adding it to a dedicated motor fuel tax fund. But that idea was scotched because it would have meant figuring out other ways to replenish the general fund.
"What's happening is that the states, the governors, have realized that Congress is not coming to the rescue," said Rick Geddes, director of Cornell University's Infrastructure Policy Program. "States are looking at all sorts of different options for funding their systems. Virginia has increased sales tax. Others are doing more tolling at congested times. Some are increasing their own gas and diesel taxes."
Instead of taxing gasoline, Oregon is watching a pilot program that taxes drivers based on the number of miles driven and on which kinds of roads. The program requires adding a device to vehicles that tracks where drivers are going and how far they are traveling, which makes some people nervous about privacy issues.
Why not just increase the taxes on gasoline? After all, the gas tax hasn't kept up with inflation. The previous time the state increased the motor fuel tax was 1990, when the rate went from 16 to 19 cents per gallon. Federal gas taxes have stayed at 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993.
One result, Poole said, is inequity.
"The early adopters of alternative fuel vehicles, these are more expensive than the average car, and it's the lower-income folks who stick with old, used cars for as long as they can keep them going, and they're the ones who are going to be hit the hardest with any increase in the gas tax," he said.
State governments aren't the only ones struggling. Over the past five years, Congress has transferred $53 billion from the general fund to the Highway Trust Fund in order to compensate for lagging gas tax revenues, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. The Highway Trust Fund supports 39 percent of Illinois' infrastructure needs, according to the American Road and Transportation Builders Association.
The Highway Trust Fund receives 85 percent of its funding from gasoline and other motor fuels, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
"For the past few years, there hasn't been enough money in the Highway Trust Fund, so they've been pulling money out of the general fund," said Crosson, of HNTB. "When the Highway Trust Fund was set up, it made sense. But it hasn't been indexed for inflation and fuel efficiency. It's woefully underfunded."

It ended when McCain left to appear on every other television channel on earth.

By-polls: voting begins for 3 LS  33 assembly seatsGujarat
Deesa, Maninagar, Tankara, Khambhalia, Mangrol, Talaja, Anand, Matar, Limkheda
The BJP, which won a whopping 71 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in May, has the most at stake as it held all the 11 Assembly seats along with its ally Apna Dal.
The Assembly constituencies which will go to the polls on Saturday are Lucknow (East), Charkhari, Sirathu, Balha, Rohania, Nighasan, Saharanpur city, Bijnore, Thalurdwara, Noida, and Hamirpur. Mainpuri is the lone Lok Sabha constituency. The number of voters in Mainpuri is 1647,176.
The biggest Assembly segment in terms of voters is Noida (523,762) and the smallest is Thakurdwara (329,438).
For the Samajwadi Party, the polls are an opportunity to make a comeback, after its disastrous showing in the Lok Sabha battle where its numbers dipped from 22 to five.
The Mainpuri Lok Sabha constituency was vacated by Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav. The SP has fielded Tej Pratap Singh Yadav, a grandnephew of Mulayam Singh, while the BJP has fielded Prem Singh Shakya.
The Bahujan Samaj Party has this time decided not to contest.
Balloting begins in two WB seats
Voting for the Chowringhee and Basirhat (South) Assembly constituencies in West Bengal began at 7 a.m. on Saturday.
Chowringhee in Kolkata was won by Trinamool’s Sikha Mitra in 2011 assembly polls, where the party fought jointly with the Congress.
The 2,00,256 electors spread across 222 polling stations have to choose from nine candidates — Trinamool’s Nayna Bandyopadhyay, BJP’s Ritesh Tiwari, Congress’ Santosh K. Pathak, CPI (M)’s Faiyaz Ahmad Khan and five independents.
The Basirhat (South) constituency is a seat newly carved out in 2011. Nearly 235,843 people are eligible to vote in 286 polling stations.
The BJP has made infiltration from across the Bangladesh border a major issue in this constituency.
After two of its leaders were put behind bars in the multi-crore-rupee chit fund scandal, the ruling Trinamool Congress has come under fire from its political rivals.
Voters queue up in Telangana, Andhra
The Medak Lok Sabha constituency in Telangana and the Nandigama Assembly seat in Andhra Pradesh went to polls from 7 a.m. on Saturday. The polling in both the constituencies will continue till 6 p.m.
Over 15.43 lakh voters are eligible to cast their franchise in the prestigious Medak parliamentary constituency, which was once represented by late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
A total of 14 candidates are in fray in Medak but it is mainly a triangular contest.
Polling begins for 4 Rajasthan Assembly seats
Polling began on Saturday in four Rajasthan Assembly constituencies.
As many as 8.95 lakh people are eligible to cast their votes at 961 polling stations in Nasirabad, Weir, Surajgarh and Kota South.
A total of 23 candidates are in the fray, with maximum of nine candidates contesting from Surajgarh and the minimum of three from Weir.
The by-elections were necessitated as BJP legislators Sanwar Lal Jat from Nasirabad, Bahadur Singh Koli from Weir, Santosh Ahlawat from Surajgarh and Om Birla from Kota South got elected to the Lok Sabha.
The main fight is between the Congress and the ruling BJP.
Poll in Assam, Tripura
Ballotting began on Saturday for by-elections in Assam’s three Assembly constituencies — Silchar, Lakhipur and Jamunamukh, officials said.
By-election for Silchar was necessitated after Congress legislator Sushmita Dev’s election to the Lok Sabha.
The Lakhipur seat fell vacant after the death of sitting legislator and former Minister Dinesh Prasad Goala, while the Jamunamukh seat was vacated by AIUDF leader Sirajuddin Ajmal after being elected to the Lok Sabha from Barpeta.
As many as 25 candidates are in the fray — 12 are contesting in Silchar, five in Lakhipur and eight in Jamunamukh.
Over five lakh electors, including more than two lakh women, will be able to exercise ttheir democratic right at 588 polling stations.
In Tripura, by-elections for the tribal-reserved Manu Assembly constituency on Saturday morning, an official said.
Tripura Chief Electoral officer Ashutosh Jindal said 38,843 voters, including 18,929 women, are eligible to vote in 46 polling stations in 38 locations.
There are six candidates in the fray.
The by-poll was necessitated after former Forest and Rural Development Minister Jitendra Chaudhary, who won the seat five times on the CPI (M) ticket, was elected to the Lok Sabha from the Tripura East constituency.
Tight security in Chhattisgarh
Amid tight security, voting began in the insurgency-hit Antagarh assembly constituency for the bypoll where only two candidates, including one from the ruling BJP, are in the fray in the tribal-dominated seat.
“The polling has begun in Antagarh seat from 7 am,” an election official said.
As many as 1,51,894 electorates would exercise their franchise at 202 polling stations, including 190 hyper sensitive and three auxiliary booths, till 3 pm, he said.
Around 10,000 security personnel have been deployed in the region to ensure fair and peaceful polling, he added.
It is for the first time since its formation, that Chhattisgarh will not witness any contest between the BJP and the Congress in the assembly poll as the main opposition’s candidate surprisingly withdrew from the contest at the last moment.
Election for the seat was necessitated after BJP MLA Vikram Usendi resigned after he was elected to the Lok Sabha from the Kanker seat.
After the declaration of the bypoll schedule, Congress, which had been struggling after a humiliating defeat in both the Assembly as well as Lok Sabha elections, had declared Manturam Pawar as its candidate from the seat, anticipating a good show.
However, Pawar surprisingly pulled out from the contest a day before the last day of withdrawal of nominations on August 29, after which he was expelled from the Congress.
Fourteen candidates had filed their nominations for the Antagarh bypoll and after scrutiny as well as withdrawal of nominations, only two candidates namely Bhojraj Naag of the BJP and Rupdhar Pudo of the Ambedkarite Party of India are now in the fray.

Relations with Modi are cordial  says Rajnath SinghPrint
He is our Prime Minister and an effective Prime Minister and I am the Home Minister in his government. What else, said Singh. (Source: PTI)
Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: September 12, 2014 3:28 pm | Updated: September 12, 2014 3:46 pm
Brushing aside reports of differences with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Friday said the relationship between the two is “cordial”.
“He is our Prime Minister and an effective Prime Minister and I am the Home Minister in his government. What else,” Singh said.
After a pause, he said, “Humare sambandh madhur they, madhur hai aur madhur rahenge (Our relations were cordial, are cordial and will always remain like that).”
Singh was asked about his relations with Modi and whether there were some problems in playing his innings.
Earlier, in his opening statement at a press conference on completion of 100 days in office, Singh drew a parallel on the working of his ministry with cricket.
“Working in the Home Ministry is neither a 20-20 nor a one-day cricket match but a test match where one has to play a long innings for which we need to have a strong opening.
“We have got that a good opening stand, I think. We aspire to play a long innings and even a second innings,” he said.

Protestant firebrand Ian Paisley dies at 88Paisley the fiery Protestant leader has died in Northern Ireland aged 88 on Sept. 12, 2014. (Source: AP)
Associated Press | Dublin | Posted: September 12, 2014 7:18 pm | Updated: September 12, 2014 7:22 pm
The Rev. Ian Paisley, the divisive Protestant firebrand who devoted his life to thwarting compromise with Catholics in Northern Ireland only to become a pivotal peacemaker in his twilight years, died Friday in Belfast, his wife said. He was 88.
Paisley was Northern Ireland’s most polarizing politician throughout the worst years of its civil strife, during which the evangelist’s blistering oratory was often blamed for fueling four decades of bloodshed that claimed 3,700 lives.
Yet at the zenith of his peace-wrecking powers, Paisley in 2007 stunned the world by delivering the province’s first stable unity government between its British Protestants and its Irish Catholics. Dr. No, as he was widely known, finally said yes _ and his powerful U-turn cemented a peace process that he had done so much to frustrate.
Paisley’s widow, Eileen, expressed hope of meeting him again in heaven. “Although ours is the grand hope of reunion, naturally as a family we are heartbroken,” she said in a statement.
Tributes to Paisley flowed in from across Britain and Ireland, including from Irish Republican Army veterans and others long critical of the preacher.
“I developed a close working relationship with him which developed into a friendship, which despite our many differences lasted beyond his term in office,” said Martin Mc Guinness, the former IRA commander who joined Paisley atop the peacemaking coalition in 2007.
From the earliest days of Northern Ireland’s conflict, Paisley prophesied damnation for any Protestant politician or church leader who dared to build bridges with the Catholic Church and Irish nationalists. Mainstream Protestant leaders, in turn, sought to dismiss Paisley as a bigoted crank.
Hostile to the establishment, Paisley built his own extremist power base. His evangelical sect, the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster, labeled the pope as the antichrist and called the major Protestant denominations ecumenical Judases. His Democratic Unionist Party insisted that Northern Ireland’s union with Britain could not tolerate concessions to Irish nationalist demands.
Often backed by menacing Protestant mobs and masked men, Paisley led club-wielding blockades of 1960s Catholic civil rights marches. He demanded the military destroy the resurgent Irish Republican Army and denounced the U.S.-brokered Good Friday peace accord of 1998 as a surrender to “the men of blood” in the IRA’s Sinn Fein party.
Protestants rallied behind him with such fervor that no political initiative could last without his support. Over and over, he claimed the political scalps of compromise-minded Protestant leaders from the rival Ulster Unionist Party.
In 1973, Ulster Unionist leaders cut a peace deal with moderate Catholics and the Irish government that foreshadowed the ultimate success of the Good Friday pact a quarter-century later. But Paisley worked with Ulster Unionist hard-liners and Protestant paramilitary groups to bring Northern Ireland to a standstill. Roads were blocked, continued…

On a different pitch: Yuvraj meets Shah  sets off campaigning role buzzYuvraj meets Shah, sets off campaigning role buzz

Cricketer Yuvraj Singh on Friday met BJP president Amit Shah in Delhi, triggering speculation that he may campaign for the party in Haryana, which goes to polls on October 15.
Yuvraj, who lives in Chandigarh, has a considerable fan following in Haryana and Punjab.
“He will be appealing to voters to elect a government that can ensure development of the state,” a BJP leader said after the brief meeting between Yuvraj and Shah. 
The cricketer’s sports manager Nishant Jeet Arora, however, dismissed any such speculation.

@YOUWECAN is a cancer initiative by the southpaw.
The BJP is trying to make inroads into the Jat heartland of Haryana this time, in an attempt to challenge chief minister and Congress’ Jat strongman Bhupinder Singh Hooda, who is fighting rising anti-incumbency and infighting within his party.
In the last assembly polls in 2009, the Congress had won around 20 of the 35 assembly seats that are dominated by the Jat community.
The saffron party — seen largely as party of non-Jats — stole a march over its rival by announcing candidates for 43 out of 90 assembly seats on Tuesday night, even before the polls were announced.

Did maritime museum inspire Chinese prez Xi Jinpings new silk route dreamprint
President Xi Jinping’s grand idea of reviving the ancient maritime silk route — touching countries via a sea trade route as far as India and beyond — could have well come to him during his visits to the Quanzhou Maritime Museum during his long tenure in the Fujian province.
Besides showcasing hundreds of multi-cultural and multi-religious artefacts brought to the city by sea-faring traders centuries ago, the unassuming museum boasts a rare, historical connection with India – it displays nearly 200 carvings, sculptures and remnants from a Hindu temple built a thousand years ago.
During his Fujian tenure between 1985 and 2002, Xi visited the temple and could take time to go over the exhibits and ask about details from the museum curators.
“President Xi learnt a lot about China’s maritime history in Fujian. There could definitely be a connection (between his study of the maritime history and his idea of a modern sea silk route),” Wang Liming, the present curator, said on Friday, adding that under him, the museum got millions in government grants.
The remnants of the Hindu temple were unearthed during the middle of last century and subsequently preserved in the museum.
It is evidence, according to Wang, that traders from southern India frequented Quanzhou — now designated as the starting port for the ancient maritime route — a hub for traders from Asia and Africa during the 12th and 13th centuries Officials in Fuzhou, the provincial capital, talked animatedly on Thursday about the old India connection are very enthused with the idea of the sea route.
They felt that there was a lot to explore and expand business and trade cooperation with India; they expect Xi to bring up the topic of the maritime silk route with PM Narendra Modi during his India visit next week.
India is waiting for clearer details about Xi’s project.
India of course would be wary about the strategic objectives of the plan, especially as China has approached both Sri Lanka and Maldives to be part of it.

Warning of costs  court slams CBI for hurry in closing Birla caseThe court also asked the CBI to explain why it had ruled out the “element of criminality” in the allocation to Hindalco.
Written by Kaunain Sherrif | New Delhi | Posted: September 13, 2014 4:37 am
A Delhi court on Friday pulled up the CBI over the closure report filed in a coal block allocation case against Kumar Mangalam Birla-owned Hindalco. The investigating agency was rebuked after it told the court that the original minutes of the screening committee meeting, in which Hindalco’s application seeking coal blocks was taken up, were “missing”.
Special Judge Bharat Parashar told the CBI that it should “keep its house in order”, failing which the court would “start imposing cost on the top officials of the CBI and deduct the cost from their salaries”. Stating that the CBI had made a “mockery” of the closure report, Parashar asked the agency why it was in a “hurry” to file one.
The agency, which informed the court that primary evidence containing original minutes of the screening committee meeting was missing, was asked by the judge to submit written documents to back the same. “Show if there was any statement which says that original minutes of the meeting of the screening committee were missing… did you think the court will accept the closure report with closed eyes?” Parashar said.
The investigation officer (IO), who failed to submit the primary evidence containing original minutes of the meeting, had submitted secondary evidence in support of the closure report, saying that the “relevant” bank officials had authenticated the same. The court responded: “Can a bank official authenticate the documents of the Coal Ministry? What provisions of the law prevented you take authentication from the ministry officials. How can you submit secondary evidence like this?”
The court proceedings then saw another twist as the judge ordered the IO to get the police file and case diary within an hour from its Delhi headquarters, based on which the agency had initiated the preliminary enquiry into the case. “What kind of investigation have you done? What was the supervisory officer (SO) doing? Bring the police file and case diary and call your supervisory officer to the court now,” the judge told the IO.
The SO, who then appeared before the court, was told: “You have a legal department. I am sure you have consulted them before filing the closure report. When you filed the report, have you at least made sure that it is legally sustainable?”
The court questioned the SO further and asked whether the agency had “analysed” the facts of the case according to the evidence Act. “You have collected the facts and suddenly jumped to a conclusion. My query is, did you even understand the facts of the case according to the evidence Act before coming to a conclusion? Every chargesheet should run like a story. There is no sequence in your story,” the special judge said.
The court also continued…

Polling for 3 LS  33 assembly seats begins; high stakes for BJP in UPComments
Brisk voting was recorded in most of the 33 assembly seats and 3 Lok Sabha seats where bypolls were held on Saturday.
In Uttar Pradesh voting percentage was highest  in Mainpuri Lok Sabha constituency, which was vacated by Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh. Mulayam's grandnephew Tej Pratap Singh Yadav, 27, is contesting the seat on an SP ticket.
Among the voters was chief minister Akhilesh Yadav who landed in Saifai to cast his ballot.
Lack of enthusiasm was witnessed among the voters in the first two hours in all the constituencies, but slowly picked up later. By 3 pm around 44 % had cast their votes. Mild rains also affected the voter turnout.
The Mainpuri seat was held by SP, while all the eleven Assembly seats where voting is on were held by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
In West Bengal voting was brisk in Basirhat Dakshin while Chowringhee had lower voter turnout. Both the Left and the BJP accused the ruling TMC of terrorising voters, BJP's Basirhat candidate Samik Bhatatcharya said.
Over 62% polling was recorded in Basirhat Dakshin while nearly 40% voters exercised their franchise in Chowringhee  till 2 pm.
Voting was also brisk and peaceful in Telangana, Rajasthan and other states where bypolls are held.
Analysts are looking to see which way the wind blows in the bypolls spread across these nine states.
The results of two Lok Sabha seats — Vadodara which was vacated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Medak in Telangana was vacated by Telangana Rashtra Samithi chief and chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao — are unlikely to throw any surprises. But Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav’s prestige is at stake in his home turf Mainpuri, the third Lok Sabha seat.
The bypolls are being seen as an indicator of the popularity of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and opposition parties ahead of four assembly elections to be held this year.
They also pose a key question on the future of the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in Uttar Pradesh.
The BJP swept to power on the back of a so-called Modi wave this summer, but failed to maintain the momentum in last month’s by-elections in four states where it lost a majority of seats to the Congress party and its allies.
The BJP and its allies together won only eight of the 18 seats that went to the polls while the Congress and its allies won 10.
In the last Lok Sabha polls, a large number of OBCs and Dalits rallied behind the BJP across the Hindi belt. The shift dented the SP and BSP’s support base in the largest electoral state. The SP won just seven seats while Mayawati’s BSP drew a blank.
The grand alliance of the RJD-JDU-Congress could halt the BJP’s charge into this caste base. In the absence of such an alliance in Uttar Pradesh, any further losses may lead to an existential crisis for the two caste-based parties.
If the opposition parties — especially the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress in Rajasthan, Gujarat and Assam — can stop the BJP’s march, their claim about the Modi wave waning will receive a further boost.
With elections in Maharashtra and Haryana due next month, any by-election victory will also give the beleaguered Congress a fresh face saver after its humiliating Lok Sabha defeat.
But it may not be so easy for the opposition. Of the 33 seats, 11 are in Uttar Pradesh where the BJP swept 71 of 80 Lok Sabha seats.
In Gujarat and Rajasthan, where 13 assembly seats are up for grabs, the opposition could not even open its account in the general election.
Three seats are heading for the polls in Congress-ruled Assam where the BJP bagged 50% of Lok Sabha constituencies.
In West Bengal, the ruling Trinamool Congress will be desperate to win both seats as it wants to show that the Saradha scam has not hurt the party’s prospects.
For the BJP, a win or even a number two position in the results from Assam and Bengal will further cement its position as a fast emerging force, replacing traditional opposition parties like AGP and Left, respectively.
The by-elections in Chhattisgarh, Sikkim, Andhra and Tripura will test if the ruling parties can further consolidate their positions. Tripura is the only state where the Left is in power.

Ballotting begins in Assam for 3 assembly seats#assam #assam bypolls #silchar #lakhipur #jamunamukh
Guwahati: Nearly 70 per cent polling was recorded in the peaceful bye-election for three seats of Assam Assembly on Saturday to decide the fate of 25 contestants in Silchar, Lakhipur and Jamunamukh. Jamunamukh in Nagaon district witnessed over 74 per cent polling, while Silchar and Lakhipur in Cachar district saw 63 per cent and 66 per cent voting respectively, Election Commission officials said.
Officials said re-polling may be held in three polling booths each in Silchar and Lakhipur constituencies due to malfunctioning of electronic voting machines.
Arun Dutta Majumdar (Congress), Dilip Kumar Paul (BJP) and Nur Ahmed Barbhuyan (AIUDF) are the prominent contestants among 12 in Silchar, while former Congress MLA Dinesh Prasad Goala's son Rajdeep Goala (Congress), Mukesh Pandey (AIUDF) and Sanjay Thakur (BJP) are notables among eight contestants in Lakhipur.
Jamunamukh in Nagaon district witnessed over 74 per cent polling, while Silchar and Lakhipur in Cachar district saw 63 per cent and 66 per cent voting respectively, Election Commission officials said.
Jamunamukh has AIUDF president Badruddin Ajmal's son Abdur Rahim Ajmal, Bashir Uddin Laskar (Congress) and Bilal Uddin (BJP), besides two others in the fray.
The by-election was necessitated following the
election of Silchar Congress MLA Sushmita Dev and Jamunamukh AIUDF MLA Mohammad Sirajuddin Ajmal to the Lok Sabha during the last general polls.
The death of sitting Congress MLA Dinesh Prasad Goala necessitated bypoll in Lakhipur. Counting of votes will be held on September 16.

Ahmedabad: 49 per cent turn-out was on Saturday recorded in the byelections to the Lok Sabha seat vacated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and nine assembly seats in Gujarat.
Polling was peaceful barring some minor incidents. "Gujarat has registered an approximate 49 per cent voter turn-out," a statement from the Election Commission said.
In the last assembly election in 2012, the turn-out was 71.32 per cent, while that in 2014 Lok Sabha elections was 63.31 per cent.
Vadodara is the lone Lok Sabha seat going for the bypolls in Gujarat, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi vacated this seat after winning with huge margin.
Vadodara Lok Sabha constituency, where bypoll became necessary after Modi decided to retain Varanasi seat, registered 43.5 per cent polling, as against 70.75 per cent in April.
Maninagar in Ahmedabad, from where Modi resigned as MLA, registered the lowest polling amongst the nine assembly seats at 33.5 per cent.

A scuffle took place between Congress workers and jawans of Border Security Force at Maliya-Hatina in Mangrol. BJP filed a complaint of poll code violation against Congress candidates Kanti Sodha Parmar (Anand), Jatin Kella (Maninagar) and Chhatrasinh Meda (Limkheda) for allegedly entering the polling booth wearing scarfs bearing the Congress symbol.
Congress candidate from Vadodara Lok Sabha seat Narendra Ravat sparked a controversy by clicking a selfie showing his ink-marked finger outside the polling booth and displaying the party symbol after casting his vote.
The assembly by-elections were necessitated after sitting BJP MLAs were elected to Lok Sabha.

Why Netflix Looks Different Todayreddit
Wednesday is Internet Slowdown day, and some of your favorite websites may look a little different -- but they probably won't be any slower.
Netflix, Reddit, Tumblr, Etsy, The Nation, Boing Boing and many other websites are displaying the "wheel of death" to show their support for net neutrality, or the idea that all web traffic should be treated equally. But none of the sites have actually slowed down, so feel free to binge watch those old "Scandal" episodes.
Netflix's home page looked something like this. We've circled the relevant bit in red:
"The Internet is slow enough already," said Evan Greer, a campaign director at Fight for the Future, a nonprofit that helped organize Wednesday's protest.  "Our goal is to prevent that from continuing." Greer's group joined with the nonprofit Engine Advocacy, political action group Demand Progress and consumer group Free Press Action Fund in persuading nearly 10,000 websites to participate in the day's slowdown.
The symbolic action comes just days before the Federal Communications Commission closes off the opportunity for Americans to comment on its proposal that would allow for an Internet fast lane. A fast lane would let some websites operate at higher speeds and essentially relegate many sites -- likely smaller, less-moneyed ones -- to a slower pace. The FCC is taking public comments on the rules until Sept. 15.
The hope is that just the thought of a slower Internet will spur people to action. The advocacy organizations want people to display the logo on their Facebook or Twitter profiles, or to use the links in sites' embeds to contact the FCC or sign a letter to representatives to ask for net neutrality to be protected.
"It's encouraging to see so many prominent companies participating in the day of action in support of an open Internet,” said Evan Engstrom, Policy Director at Engine, in a statement. “The FCC needs to know that preserving strong net neutrality rules is necessary to ensure that the Internet remains a platform for innovation and economic growth."
The worry is that if neutrality goes away, cable providers would charge "tolls" for VIP web speeds. Many people have criticized Comcast for just this reason, after the cable giant signed a deal with Netflix earlier this year to give the streaming service a fast lane. Yet Comcast isn't arguing against net neutrality. “Comcast supports an Open Internet and net neutrality," a company spokesperson wrote in an email to The Huffington Post.
"We reluctantly signed interconnection agreements" with Comcast and other large Internet providers, a Netflix spokesperson told HuffPost in an email. Netflix has been an outspoken supporter of net neutrality. "Strong net neutrality rules are needed to stop Internet service providers from demanding extra fees or slowing delivery of content to consumers who already have paid for Internet access," the company said in a statement.
Though Google isn't technically participating in Wednesday's protest, the site is aligning itself on the side of net neutrality. In an email sent out on Tuesday morning, Google voiced its support for the effort:
"If Internet access providers can block some services and cut special deals that prioritize some companies' content over others," Google wrote, "that would threaten the innovation that makes the Internet awesome."
Here's the full Google email:
Facebook, obviously a major voice in the tech space, did not have a slowdown logo on its site as of Wednesday afternoon.
Tumblr is running a short blog post displaying a wheel of death and offering users a nifty submission form that easily lets people send feedback to the FCC.
In a blog post earlier this week, a Reddit co-founder called a web without net neutrality a " Clusterfuck ."
Reddit's homepage looked like this on Wednesday:
If you want your voice to be heard in the debate over net neutrality, you can email the FCC directly or use this form on the Electronic Frontier Foundation's Web site . You can also buy this T-shirt with a picture of a cat and the words "Team Internet," which is what Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian is calling his side of the debate.
This story has been updated with a comment from Netflix.

Facebook Is Testing Self-Destructing Postsreddit
Ever wanted to set a self-destruct timer on your Facebook posts? Well, just in case, you may soon be able to do just that.
The social networking site is testing a new feature that will let you schedule a post for deletion. All you have to do is set the length of time, and the post will go poof when you want it to.
“We’re running a small pilot of a feature on Facebook for iOS that lets people schedule deletion of their posts in advance,” a Facebook spokesperson told The Huffington Post on Wednesday.
Though it's unclear precisely when Facebook started the test, a few people have reported seeing the following option to "Choose Expiration" on their Facebook posts:

But what kind of posts would you want to self-destruct? Maybe information about an event? A declaration of love for a relationship you don't think will last? A birthday celebration?
Whatever the reason, it's nice that Facebook is attempting to make little improvements. Most recently, Facebook tested a feature that let users search through their friends' old posts .
Facebook has tried some things with self-destruction before. This past June, it accidentally released a Snapchat clone called Slingshot before it meant to. So far, Slingshot hasn't had much mainstream success.
Originally, what differentiated Slingshot from Snapchat was that when someone sent you a photo, you'd have to send one back to them in order to open the incoming image. But Facebook removed that feature last week, and now Slingshot is essentially just Snapchat with a different name. And Slingshot has a huge flaw: It doesn't warn you when someone takes a screenshot of your photo .

Navy searches for pilot after jets crash into seaPrint
Associated Press | Washington | Posted: September 12, 2014 9:08 pm
Pentagon officials say two U.S. Navy jets have crashed into the western Pacific Ocean and that one pilot was rescued and a search is on for the other.
The F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets were from Carrier Air Wing 17 based at Naval Air Station Lemoore in California’s San Joaquin Valley. The air wing is embarked on the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson.
The Navy says the rescued pilot was returned to the carrier and is being treated. It says the planes haven’t been recovered.
Officials say other aircraft still in the air in the vicinity were safely recovered.
An F/A-18E Super Hornet crashed in June as it prepared to land on the Carl Vinson off the Southern California coast. The pilot was able to eject safely.

Supreme Court clears 3% quotas for disabled  in jobs  promotionsSupreme court asked the Centre to show a big heart and give the differently-abled people their due in all central and state government jobs.
Written by Utkarsh Anand | New Delhi | Posted: September 13, 2014 4:27 am
The Supreme Court on Friday ruled in favour of three per cent reservation for differently-abled candidates in civil services, not only at the stage of their appointments but also for departmental promotions.
Giving a level-playing field to more than four crore people with disabilities in India, the apex court held that the Centre, states and Union Territories were obligated to implement the rules of reservation for this class in the matters of appointment, selection, direct recruitment, deputation and also for promotions. It asked the Centre to show a big heart and give the differently-abled people their due in all central and state government jobs.
A bench led by Chief Justice of India R M Lodha reiterated its earlier verdict that the principle of not exceeding 50 per cent reservation would not be applicable while granting quota for differently-abled people.
The bench expressed its displeasure at the government seeking to adopt a hyper-technical approach, as its counsel pressed that three per cent reservation could be given only at the stage of appointment but not for promotion. The Persons With Disabilities Act provides for three per cent quota for the differently-abled people.
“Appointment will include promotion. You are frustrating the very reservation policy for the disabled — the class for which this beneficial piece of legislation was enacted, by arguing against it,” the bench, also comprising Justices Kurian Joseph and Rohinton F Nariman, told Additional Solicitor General Pinky Anand.
Anand sought to point out that the reservation at the stage of promotion may lead to huge resentment, especially among employees in Group A and Group B categories, since many beneficiaries may get ahead of their seniors.
She was placing an appeal against the Bombay High Court order, directing the government to implement three per cent reservation for the differently-abled in civil services recruitment, besides granting the benefit in the matter of promotion too. This order was issued on a PIL filed by the National Confederation for Development of Disabled, which was represented by senior advocate R S Suri and Arpit Bhargava in the apex court.
The bench, however, told the Additional Solicitor General that the objective of the reservation policy, as envisaged by Parliament, was unequivocal that the differently-abled people must get the benefits without technical impediments.
“Once Parliament prescribes for reservation in appointments, it will cover direct recruitment, promotion and even deputation. Our experience tells us that it is one legislation that has never been effectively implemented. In any case, it is a beneficial legislation and you should interpret in a manner so that they get the benefits,” said the bench.
At this, the Additional Solicitor General agreed with the bench and conceded not to press the appeal any further. The court continued…

Re-negotiating seat-sharing in Maharashtra: Javadekarelection
Formula based on LS performance
The Bharatiya Janata Party and the Shiv Sena are close to clinching a seat-sharing arrangement between them and smaller partners for the Assembly elections in Maharashtra.
“The seat sharing arrangement is being re-negotiated,” Union Minister of State Prakash Javadekar said here on Friday.
The grand alliance (Mahayuti) between the BJP, Sena and others is trying to wrest power after a gap of 15 years.
Indications are that a formula is being worked out on the basis of the performance of the two parties in the State in the recent Lok Sabha elections, which may bring more seats for the BJP than the 117 it had fought in 2009. The Sena had contested 171 seats. In a stellar performance the BJP had won 23 of the 48 Lok Sabha seats while the Shiv Sena was victorious in 18.

Railways extends experimental stops of trainsPrint
Written by Avishek G Dastidar | New Delhi | Posted: September 13, 2014 3:11 am
Despite readiness on part of his ministry to do away with unnecessary stoppages of hundreds of trains, which  slow down the network, Railway Minister Sadananda Gowda has decided to defer the decision to avoid a political backlash.
On Friday, the Railways extended the stoppages indefinitely as Gowda and his team of officials decided to write letters to each MP, past and present, upon whose wishes the stoppages had been granted, explaining to each of them why these stoppages needed to be scrapped. There are over 250 such explanatory letters to be sent.
Thanks to huge revenue leakage coupled with operational constrains of the Railways caused by the 1250 ‘experimental stops’ which had been granted to trains across India following requests from MPs in the past few years, Gowda had agreed to scrap them by September 30. He had also sounded out Parliament that these stoppages would be “reviewed”.
“I will write to the MPs, while the minister will write to Union ministers, present and past, who are on the list, so that they can explain the reasons to people in their constituencies,” Devi Prasad Pande, Member Traffic, Railway Board, told The Indian Express. Sources said Gowda had taken the matter up to the PMO, which had advised him not to go ahead with the move without explaining to the MPs concerned why this decision was necessary.
In an internal costing exercise done as part of the Rail Budget, it was discovered that each additional stop was costing Railways Rs 8,000 on account of fuel and other operational costs associated with stoppages. In return, the national transporter was getting back less than Rs 500 per such stoppage on an average. The estimated revenue leakage per year is a staggering Rs 300 crore (not all trains run daily), nibbling into whatever little the cash-strapped transporter manages to earn from running the highly subsidised passenger trains.
It is this economics, besides the fact that the mammoth network slows down every time a train needs to stop unnecessarily, that the letters to the MPs would contain. The letters are said to be ready to be signed and would be dispatched immediately.

Rashtriya Janata Dal president Lalu Prasad was discharged from a hospital here on Saturday, weeks after undergoing multiple cardiac surgeries following a diagnosis of aortic stenosis.
Doctors at the Asian Heart Institute (AHI) said Mr. Prasad was “hale and hearty” at the time of discharge.
After three procedures which lasted more than six hours, Mr. Prasad spent over a week in cardiac rehabilitation.
“He has made an uneventful recovery. He has been an excellent and cooperative patient with strong willpower. This has helped him immensely in his speedy recovery,” Ramakanta Panda, vice-chairman and managing director of the hospital, said.
Mr. Prasad had a 3-mm hole in the heart repaired and underwent aortic repair and aortic valve replacement.
Normally in such cases, Mr. Panda said, “we start cardiac rehabilitation after 15 days of the surgery, but considering his stable condition, we started this process after nine days.”
Vijay D’Silva, medical director of the hospital, under whose observation Mr. Prasad was kept, said the post-operative recovery went “smoothly.” At the time of discharge, Mr. Prasad’s vital parameters were within normal range.
He will be on blood-thinning medication for two-and-a-half months.

Cricketer Yuvraj Singh on Friday met BJP president Amit Shah in Delhi, triggering speculation that he may campaign for the party in Haryana, which goes to polls on October 15.
Yuvraj, who lives in Chandigarh, has a considerable fan following in Haryana and Punjab.
“He will be appealing to voters to elect a government that can ensure development of the state,” a BJP leader said after the brief meeting between Yuvraj and Shah. 
The cricketer’s sports manager Nishant Jeet Arora, however, dismissed any such speculation.
Dear friends, just to clarify @YUVSTRONG12 met BJP president Shri Amit Shah to discuss cancer problem in India n wht @YOUWECAN is doing.

Yuvraj’s official handle retweeted Arora.
@YOUWECAN is a cancer initiative by the southpaw.
The BJP is trying to make inroads into the Jat heartland of Haryana this time, in an attempt to challenge chief minister and Congress’ Jat strongman Bhupinder Singh Hooda, who is fighting rising anti-incumbency and infighting within his party.
In the last assembly polls in 2009, the Congress had won around 20 of the 35 assembly seats that are dominated by the Jat community.
The saffron party — seen largely as party of non-Jats — stole a march over its rival by announcing candidates for 43 out of 90 assembly seats on Tuesday night, even before the polls were announced.

HCL has to be ready for the new world: Shiv NadarShiv Nadar, Founder & Chairman, HCL Technologies
'The very reason for our being is that we looked at the new world and new technologies'
HCL Technologies is among the five fastest companies to cross $1 billion net profit, $5 billion revenue and $15 billion market capitalisation since incorporation. While smart business decisions and quick transition into newer areas have aided the company’s performance, Shiv Nadar, Founder & Chairman, believes that HCL’s strong corporate governance framework has been strategic lever for sustained growth. Recently, Nadar was conferred the ICSI Life Time Achievement Award for Excellence in Corporate Governance for the year 2013. Business Line met Nadar to talk about the pillars of corporate governance, future of HCL and his new ventures in education and healthcare. Edited Excerpts.
Where do you see HCL going forward in next 3-4 years especially HCL Infosystems, which is now moving into services?
I do think that HCL has to be ready for the new world - which is what basically HCL is good at. We have to just keep addressing that. The very reason for our being is that we looked at the new world and new technologies. That has to be inherent in our being and we don’t have to get carried away by balance sheets and P&Ls. Keep that DNA going. If you corrupt it, you will pay for it. It’s very harsh thing to say but that is true.
Will your education and healthcare ventures be as big as HCL Tech?
Healthcare would be bigger and education would be roughly similar size. And both will be built on the technologies ahead. Whenever we are on the transformation phase of technology, that’s where HCL will do very well. They are at transformative stages.
A recent report says that IT is the easiest sector to fudge accounts given its largely services led nature. Would you agree?
In large companies, the CEO is very distant from operations. Ours has got close to hundred thousand people and we have a ‘Whistle Blower’ policy which is quite independently run. There is nothing called secret in this industry. Somebody in other company will know, some analyst will know. It will be known. It is only a matter of time. So in this industry, to get away is very tough.
Recently, the Supreme Court allowed CAG to look into the books of private companies. Your views.
I don’t know the facts on this matter but I have some questions. We are subject to audit, which is fair. You can say that your internal audit need to be in this standard or your statutory audit of this standard. We don’t mind this whole thing being replaced by somebody but our job is not to sit and audit all the time, we have a business to run. And also there are sensitivities about our executives being witchhunted by some external organisation. Can we have a foreign employee being questioned by CAG? We cannot expose them to that.
Can over emphasis on performance come in the way of doing ethical business? There is a lot of pressure on executives to deliver numbers which can lead to unethical means.
It can be. The executive’s bonuses are so large, and they play on very thin ice and the ice gets thinner and thinner and thinner…and suddenly when they go to such excessive quantum, the ice cracks, which is what happened in the case of Satyam.
What is that one thing that you are really proud of in HCL as far as corporate governance systems that are in place?
First is that it is in place. I am unconnected with that and that is the next biggest thing. It’s an executive privileged to take decisions because he stands accountable for it. An executive can be fired and at the same time he can be rewarded fairly. But for doing his job he does not require anyone’s sanctions. That’s one reason why HCL has grown quite well particularly in the last 15 years.
How did you ensure that HCL had good corporate governance structure in place?
We had some very capable people to manage the company initially. It was a small business but we ran it according to rules and norms. Two, I watched it being done in HP. We had a ringside view. In the nineties, HP was easily the finest corporation in the world. We invited HP executives to participate in the management and in the board. HCL had this concept of corporate officers since inception in 1999. We had a remuneration committee. Now everyone is talking about nomination and remuneration committee. We had this from 1999.
Has there been any situation where you had to face a conflict while dealing with governance issues at the board level?
I face it very regularly actually. If you have excellent people then you have to give them the power. They can’t say Shiv Nadar is a great entrepreneur, he is proposing this, he must have thought through this. It’s his money largely. We have proposed things which I am careful enough to say whether I am in favour of it or not, because the moment I say I am in favour of it, I am proposing it. Then what am I telling them? I can be either the Chairman or Managing Director of the board and I can’t have these two jobs in conflict. So I have to say that the CEO has to propose it, the CFO can propose it. After this the rest of the board members will have their views and I cannot express my views because finally I am conducting the meeting. Good governance finally will prevail and ultimately good entrepreneurship should prevail.
Do you see a larger role for your group companies with Prime Minister Modi’s vision like Digital India or smarter cities?
I definitely think so. The government of India is consistently very advanced. When the world was hesitant on UNIX, we were the first to move in, the RBI said that all banks will implement on UNIX. It worked!
Do you see the overall sentiments improving under the new government?
I had recently met many business leaders in the world and they all said that they are coming to India. They are all very large companies, the $10 billion plus size. I asked them- are you not worried about the rate of growth? They said in Europe we do not have growth, in US it is hope, in Japan it is negative growth. Where else do they take their money and go? So they are going to come to India to invest.
There are rumours of HCL Tech being sold off. Is it true?
No, my daughter said that she is just going to keep the business. Her opinion matters in this case.

Sapota’s anticancer properties studied

Study has shown that certain chemicals in sapota fruit can inhibit tumour progression
Now, sapota joins the list of fruits that have proven anticancer properties. Proof of principle study using human cancer cell lines and mice induced with breast cancer has shown that certain chemicals in sapota fruit can inhibit tumour progression.
The study was undertaken by a team of scientists from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore and the Institute of Bioinformatics and Applied Biotechnology, Bangalore. The results were published recently in the Nature group’s journal Scientific Reports.
Experiments were carried out using different human cancer cell lines and mice induced to develop breast cancer to test and verify the efficacy of the sapota fruit extract in inhibiting cancer cell proliferation.
In the case of human cells, the anti-tumour potency was pronounced in the case of leukaemia. Of the two different human leukaemia cancer cell lines studied, the effect was pronounced in one of them (NALM6). The viability was “significantly affected” in these cell lines after 48 hours of treatment at extract concentrations of 1 mg/ml onwards. “Over 80 per cent of cell death was observed at 2 mg/ml concentration,” the paper notes. As expected, the effect of the sapota fruit extract on normal cells was “limited” compared with cancer cells.
Significant reduction
Mice induced with breast cancer and treated with the extract given through the oral route showed “significant reduction” in the tumour size. “In 50 per cent of mice studied, we could increase the lifespan by 3-fold,” said Sathees Raghavan, Associate Professor, Department of Biochemistry, IISc. “We can initiate cell death within six hours of treatment.”
The study showed that proliferation of cancer cells was inhibited by activating programmed cell death (apoptosis) and not by necrosis (killing of cancer cells).
There are two pathways through which programmed cell death can be achieved. While one is the intrinsic pathway (involving the mitochondria), the other is the extrinsic pathway (the effect is brought about from outside the cell).
“We found the extract activates the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis to kill the cancer cells,” Prof. Raghavan said. Mitochondria plays a critical role in activating apoptosis as several of the proteins responsible for cell death are present either within or outside the mitochondria. The cancer cells treated with the extract “collapsed” the transmembrane of the mitochondria.
A small haemoprotein was released following the collapse of the transmembrane and this initiated the activation of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis.
While human leukaemia cell lines were studied, in the case of mice, the effect of the extract was studied on breast cancer cells. Explaining the reason for this, Prof Raghavan said: “In India it is difficult to develop B cell leukaemia in mice using human leukaemia.”
But it is pertinent to point out that breast cancer accounts for about 30 per cent of all cancers, worldwide, while leukaemia accounts for only four per cent of all cancers in the world.
For the study, the researchers had used sapota fruit extract. As a result, which chemical(s) or molecule(s) has the effect of activating apoptosis (programmed cell death) is not known.
“The next step is to purify the active component that causes the observed anticancer properties in sapota fruit,” he said.

Kamal and the art of screenplay writingUpdated: September 12, 2014 08:01 IST
Kamal and the art of screenplay writing
BARADWAJ RANGAN
The Hindu Superstar Kamal Haasan is most fond of neoclassical music.
TOPICS
Tamil cinema
“Charu anna would be composing these funny lines and singing them to tunes of the latest Tamil film songs. Much later, RC Sakthi made me write. My friend Puviarasu made me write. Great poets such as Gnanakoothan encouraged me to write”
(This is the fifth in a series of articles on Kamal Haasan’s tryst with the arts.)
Part 4: And more on the Ilaiyaraaja connection
When I asked Kamal Haasan what kind of music he listened to, outside of work, he said, “Pretty much anything that comes my way – even dubstep, which (Gautami’s daughter) Subbulakshmi introduced me to.” He said he was most fond of neoclassical music, and he named the composer Alex North, who veered away from the traditional orchestral approach prevalent in Hollywood and incorporated other elements – jazz, for instance, in his score for ‘A Streetcar Named Desire’. (North went on to compose for well-regarded films such as ‘Spartacus’ and ‘Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?’).
“You can see those influences in my films,” Kamal Haasan said, “right from ‘Rajapaarvai’.” He then spoke about an “extraordinary neoclassical score,” a Hiranya Vadham kind of piece, which Ghibran has composed for the soon-to-be-released ‘Uthama Villain’.
“I am not a great fan of songs being part of the film, unless it’s a musical,” he said. “I think it’s high time for a bifurcation between music and cinema. It’s such a nuisance when we bring in songs. We have trained the audience like that. It takes a long time to make the audience understand that too much fried food is bad for you. They listen only if the doctor tells them. But now that the portion sizes have become small, they’ve begun to understand.”
***
We then spoke about his writing, and Kamal Haasan went into a flashback to when he must have been around 16. He and his brothers were waiting for their mother to serve them dosais and Charuhasan, on the spot, composed and sang this pastiche based on the tune of ‘Vettri meedhu vettri vandhu ennai saerum’, the popular MGR song from the 1970 film ‘Thedi Vandha Maappillai’.
“Dosai meedhu dosai vandhu ennai saerum,
Adhai vaarthu thandha perumai ellam unnai saerum,
Idli-oda chutney thandha annai allavo,
Idhu oosugindra dosai enbadhu unmai allavo.”
This is impossible to translate with its flavour intact, but the point Kamal Haasan was making was that, as with music, writing too was all around him in that household. “Charu anna would be composing these funny lines and singing them to the tunes of the latest Tamil film songs. Much later, RC Sakthi made me write. My friend Puviarasu made me write. Great poets such as Gnanakoothan encouraged me to write.” Even Raghu Rai could be added to that list, for Kamal Haasan said that poetry and photography are very important hobbies that a screenwriter should have, because they make you think of succinct ways of saying what you have to say. “I’m a great fan of Raghu Rai. Each photograph of his tells you a whole story. A little higher up, a different angle, and it’s a whole new story.”
RC Sakthi, who would go on to direct films such as ‘Dharma Yudhdham’ and ‘Sirai’, told Kamal very early in their association, “You are a screenwriter.” He thrust a 40-page notebook in Kamal’s hand and told his friend to start writing his screenplay. This was around 1970-71. Kamal started writing something called ‘Ninaivugal’ for a short film. Sakthi liked it and asked Kamal to join him as co-writer on ‘Unarchigal’, a film he was planning about the sexual misadventures of a teenager. Kamal, who would play this protagonist, came up with the title. The film was supposed to be a quickie, released in 1972.
But it got embroiled with the Censor Board over its content, which was fairly explicit for the time. The 1972 roster of the Tamil film industry included ‘Agathiyar’, ‘Dheivam’, ‘Annai Abirami’ and ‘Sakthi Leelai’. The story of a teenager who contracts a sexually transmitted disease must have been a bit of a stretch. ‘Unarchigal’, finally, made it to the screens in 1976.

AP Google said it had found that “less than 2 per cent of the username and password combinations might have worked.”
TOPICS
After Apple’s high profile iCloud fiasco, Google is the latest cybercrime victim with Russian hackers posting usernames and passwords of close to five million Google accounts online.
The list was posted on bitcoin forum btcsec.com by a user called Tvskit.
The user claimed that about 60 per cent of the passwords are still active.
The same Google account password is used across all Google products like Gmail, YouTube, Hangouts, Drive and Maps.
Acknowledging the leak in a blog post, Google said it had found that “less than 2 per cent of the username and password combinations might have worked.”
It further said that Google’s automated anti-hijacking systems would have blocked many of those login attempts.

Former CAGs charges against Manmohan Singh spark controversyFormer CAG’s charges against Manmohan Singh spark controversy
Our Bureau
The law will take its own course: I&B Minister Prakash Javdekar
Vinod Rai may need a narco test: Congress; confirms everything we said: BJP
New Delhi, September 12:  
The ruling BJP on Friday hit out at former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress President Sonia Gandhi for scams in the allotment of coal blocks, 2G, CWG, jeejaji (son-in-law, a reference to Priyanka Gandhi’s husband Robert Vadra) and Air India.
Revealations confirm
A day after former Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) Vinod Rai made sensation disclosures on a television channel that coincided with the release of his book Not Just an Accountant: The Diary of the Nation’s Conscience Keeper, the BJP fielded its former spokesperson and Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javdekar to assert that the revelations confirm “everything that we had said about Manmohan Singh and 10 Janpath (Sonia Gandhi’s residence).”
The I&B Minister, however, shied away from spelling out what course of action the present Government is going to take in the wake of Rai’s allegations. “The law will take its own course. We are not the sort of dispensation that interferes with the functioning of independent investigating agencies,” Javdekar said.
Defamation threats
In his book and the subsequent interviews, Rai has maintained that the former PM was fully conversant of the wrongdoings in the allotment of 2G Spectrum by his telecom minister A Raja. He has also alleged that his phone was being tapped and that three Congress leaders — former law minister Ashwini Kumar, Sanjay Nirupam and Sandeep Dikshit — tried to influence him and exhorted him not to include Manmohan Singh’s name in the scams.
The Congress, in the meantime, has maintained that Vinod Rai may need a “narco test” to verify his claims. The leaders who have been named have threatened to take Rai to court for defamation.
In the loop
The former CAG’s revelations, however, seem to have decidedly strengthened the BJP’s charges against the former regime.
“The UPA’s 10 years of loot has been exposed. After what the CAG has said, Manmohan Singh cannot claim that he did not know anything with regard to corruption in the 2G scam. A Raja had kept him in the loop for every step taken in the allotment. Secondly, you can qualify the 2G scam as a case of ‘coalition corruption’ but what about the route rationalisation and purchase of aircrafts for Air India? What about coal allotment? What about jeejaji?” Javdekar asked.
But when asked whether the BJP will pursue allegations of corruption and land scams against Sonia Gandhi’s son-in-law, Javdekar said: “We now know that the trail of corruption leads directly to 10 Janpath. But the cases are being investigated. The BJP is not going to try and influence the course of ongoing investigations,” he said.

Maharashtrians want change but are confused who to vote forMaharashtrians want change but are confused who to vote for
RAHUL WADKE
Mumbai, September 12:  
The election atmosphere in Maharashtra is charged but the sentiment is negative.
The State goes to Assembly polls on October 15 but no single party or a coalition has a decisive swing factor in its favour.
The ruling Congress-Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) coalition, which has been in power for the last 15 years, is facing a daily barrage of questions over the issue of corruption. The government of Manmohan Singh was stuck in 2G and Coal scam, while in the same manner, the Prithviraj Chavan government in the State finds itself in a morass of corruption cases, including Aadarsh Housing and Irrigation scam.
Negative image
On the other hand, opposition parties led by Bharatiya Janata Party and Shiv Sena have not managed to give a tough opposition to the ruling coalition.
Due to their internal squabbles and the absence of a charismatic face similar to Modi, these parties have not been able to cash in on the negative image of the State Government.
Political analyst Nagesh Kesari said that after 15 years of Congress-NCP rule, people want a change but they are confused as to, which party they should vote.
The ruling Congress-NCP will not ‘throw in their towel’ so easily, but it is likely that there would be lot of rebellion and party members will change sides, which could help them gain power, he said.
Votes count
Kesari said that parties such as Maharashtra Navnirman Sena led by Raj Thackeray and Aam Admi Party (AAP) of Arvind Kejriwal have become ‘nonentities’ in Assembly elections, “Firebrand activist Medha Patkar fought on AAP ticket in Parliamentary elections but she was knocked out of the race by the voters. In order to survive in a democracy people’s votes are paramount,” he pointed out.
No clear picture
Voters as well as party workers in Maharashtra don’t have a clear picture over seat sharing arrangement.
The elections are 33 days away but neither BJP-Shiv Sena alliance nor Congress-NCP has announced any seat sharing numbers.
Author and political commentator, Nilu Damle says that as on today none of the parties have any imaginative ideas, which will capture people’s attention.
In the Lok Sabha election Modi was the alternative but today in Maharashtra there is no such leader.
The present crop of top leaders in BJP such as Devendra Fadnavis, Vinod Tawde or Pankaja Munde cannot offer any credible leadership to people, he added.

Investing.com - Investing.com - Gold prices edged lower on Friday after upbeat U.S. data fueled speculation that the Federal Reserve will make fresh cuts to its bond-buying program at a policy meeting next week, with added hopes that language may hold clues as to when rates may rise also pushing the yellow metal lower.
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for December delivery traded at 1,229.10 a troy ounce during U.S. trading, down 0.80%, up from a session low of $1,228.20 and off a high of $1,242.20.
The December contract settled down 0.51% at $1,239.00 on Thursday.
Futures were likely to find support at $1218.60 a troy ounce, the low from Jan. 8, and resistance at $1,279.20, last Thursday's high.
The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary consumer sentiment index rose to a 14-month high of 84.6 this month from 82.5 in August. Analysts had expected the index to rise to 83.3 in September.
The report came after official data showed that U.S. retail sales rose 0.6% last month, in line with expectations. Retail sales for July were revised to a 0.3% gain from a previously estimated flat reading.
Core retail sales, which exclude automobiles, increased by 0.3% in August, also in line with market expectations and growing at the fastest pace since April. July's figure was revised to a 0.3% gain from a previously estimated 0.1% rise.
Friday's data fueled already growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates earlier than markets were expecting, with tightening seen taking place now in mid-2015.
A study released by the San Francisco Feb on Monday indicated that central bank officials see rates rising sooner than markets expect.
Loose monetary policies such as stimulus programs bolster gold due to its appeal as a hedge to a weaker dollar, while talk of tightening has the opposite effect.
The Fed's monthly bond-buying program currently stands at $25 billion, though markets are expecting that figure to fall to $15 billion at next week's meeting and close in October.
Investors also hope the Fed's Sept. 17 statement on monetary policy will hold clues as to when rates may rise.
Meanwhile, silver for December delivery was down 0.09% at $18.583 a troy ounce, while copper futures for December delivery were up 0.27% at $3.101 a pound.

Investing.com - Investing.com - Oil prices traded near session lows on Friday due to ongoing concerns that global supply is plentiful while global demand remains soft, which offset concerns that conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East may disrupt supply.
In the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude oil for delivery in October traded down 0.81% at $92.08 a barrel during U.S. trading. New York-traded oil futures hit a session low of $92.06 a barrel and a high of $93.67 a barrel.
The October contract settled up 1.27% at $92.83 a barrel on Thursday.
Nymex oil futures were likely to find support at $90.43 a barrel, Thursday's low, and resistance at $95.91 a barrel, the high from Sept. 2.
Oil prices fell on concerns that while the U.S. and other major economies are improving, the global economy still battles headwinds at a time when energy markets are awash in crude.
Military conflicts in Ukraine and in the Middle East have rattled nerves in recent weeks, though oil shipments have gone on without disruptions, which sent investors selling anew on Friday to wind down positions carrying geopolitical risk premiums.
Investors ignored upbeat U.S. data, mainly due to a firming dollar.
A stronger greenback makes oil less attractive commodity in dollar-denominated exchanges, especially in the eyes of investors holding other currencies.

Shankaracharya seeks probe into foreign funds of Sai devotees#shankaracharya #swami swaroopanand saraswati #sai baba #shirdi
Raipur: After raking up a controversy over the worship of Shirdi's Sai Baba, Shankaracharya Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati on Friday said the Home Ministry should probe the alleged flow of foreign funds into the bank accounts of Sai Baba supporters.
"The bank accounts and telephone records of the so-called supporters of Sai, who appear on television, should be investigated so that the entire country should know which foreign power is trying to distort the sanatan dharma and funding them. To reveal all this before public we demand the Home Minister to conduct a probe into it," the Dwaraka Peeth seer said.
Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati had convened a two-day long 'dharma sansad' (religious congregation) in Chhattisgarh's Kabirdham district in August, during which a resolution was passed that Sai Baba of Shirdi should not be worshipped as a deity by the followers of sanatan dharma.
"The bank accounts and telephone records of the so-called supporters of Sai should be investigated," the Dwaraka Peeth seer said.
Ruling out issuing any kind diktat for forceful removal of idols of Sai, he said, "We had come to a decision and delivered it to protect sanatan dharma. Now it's upon the faith of the followers of sanatan dharma. We have received proposal from hundreds of temples. They want to remove the idols of Sai Baba from their temples," he added.
The issues to be addressed in the next dharma sansad to be held in Baitul in Madhya Pradesh will be decided soon after confirming its schedule, he added. When asked about the performance of the Narendra Modi government in the first hundred days, Swaroopanand Saraswati said, "Modi has got a strong government so he should fulfil his promises particularly scrapping Article 370, removing hurdle of Ramjanmabhoomi and uniform civil code as soon as possible." He, however, said, "We should wait and see the performance of his government."

Delhi: Youth fakes his own abduction to extort money from family#delhi #abduction #extortion #cheating
New Delhi: A 22-year-old youth has been arrested for allegedly faking his own kidnapping so that he could squeeze money out of his family. According to the police, Sagar Kumar, a resident of Krishan Vihar worked as a salesman in a private company in Delhi.
On September 6, a resident of Krishan Vihar Satish Kumar registered a complaint stating that his brother Sagar Kumar (the arrested person) had gone to give money to their sister in Modinagar in Uttar Pradesh and was kidnapped. He had not returned home after paying the ransom. All his three mobile phones were switched off and the family was not able to contact him.
On September 4, they had received a call from his brother's mobile phone where he was heard crying to be saved as he was abducted by 4-5 persons. Sagar also told his family that he was blindfolded and all his money was taken away along with his mobile phones and ATM Card.
According to the police, Sagar Kumar, a resident of Krishan Vihar worked as a salesman in a private company in Delhi.
He said his abductors have threatened him to call his family and wanted to have Rs 2 lakh deposited in his SBI account, failing which he would be killed. The terrified family members then deposited Rs 2 lakh in his account on September 5.
However, the family again received a call on September 6 from Sagar's mobile that the abductors had sliced his hand. A case was registered and investigation was taken up. A police team analysed the call details of the complaint and sources were deployed.
"We came to know that the kidnapped youth was seen in Haridwar. A thorough search of the hotels was conducted but the accused was not found. A trap was then laid at all the ATM's in Haridwar to catch Sagar. He was finally nabbed on September 9 by the police, after which he confessed to have concocted his own kidnapping," said DCP (Outer) Vikramjit Singh. The police recovered Rs one lakh fifteen thousand from his hotel room.

Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa urges Centre to strive for  broad consensus  on GSTPress Trust of India | Chennai | Posted: September 11, 2014 2:03 pm
The Tamil Nadu government has said the Centre should strive for a ‘broad consensus’ on many aspects related to Goods and Services Tax (GST) and address states’ concerns on ‘permanent revenue loss’ in this regard.
This was stated in a letter to Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley by Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa, who also wrote to her state counterparts in a bid to mobilise support on GST issues raised by her.
In her September 10 letter, which was released by the state government today, Jayalalithaa recalled she had submitted a letter to him in person in June this year, highlighting some of the ‘crucial’ financial issues pertaining to Tamil Nadu, including the proposed GST.
Pointing out to a revised draft Constitution Amendment Bill circulated on June 20, 2014, she said that provisions relating to Declared Goods had been removed and alcoholic liquor for human consumption kept outside the GST.
“It has been brought to my notice that during the recent meeting of the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers held on August 20, 2014, consensus was reached amongst states on some more issues.
“(This is) including that the threshold limit for levy of GST on goods and services should be fixed at Rs 10 lakh; the threshold limit for compounding scheme should be fixed at Rs 50 lakh with a floor rate of tax at 1 per cent; and that the Exemption list under GST should be common for both CGST and SGST. I do hope that the Government of India would accede to all these points,” she said in a letter.
States should be allowed to grant exemption on all goods of local importance without any restrictions, she said, adding they should be vested with control of dealers having a turnover up to Rs 1.5 crore both for intra-state and inter-state supply of goods and services, whereby the ‘Centre can avoid expanding its administrative machinery while collecting CGST (Central GST) from such dealers.’
She disagreed with Government’s proposal to bring petroleum products under GST, saying it would ‘diminish’ the limited revenue resource of the states.
Further, the dual levy system of states’ tax on petroleum products in addition to GST was not acceptable, she said.
Jayalalithaa also opposed a proposal stating GST component of the levy on petroleum products can be at a very low rate or even zero-rated for an initial period of at least three years to avert any possible sudden revenue loss to the states.
She said there was no certainty that the revenue gain on account of levy of tax on services and on import of goods in this period would be substantial enough to offset revenue loss on account of bringing petroleum products under GST ambit.
“Nor is there any guarantee that GST will not be prematurely imposed on continued…

Italian Police Bust Massive Wine ScamItalian Police Bust Massive Wine Scam

TEL AVIV, ISRAEL - MARCH 25:  Fresh country bread and red wine are served with lunch at the Carmella Banahela bistro on March 25, 2008 in Tel Aviv, Israel. World food prices are soaring in the face of what some analysts are describing as a perfect storm of circumstances; increasing demand from developing economies in Asia, rising fuel prices, severe weather impacting recent harvests and an economic shift to biofuel production. All this leaves the consumer paying more for basic staples such as br
Producers of Tuscany's Brunello di Montalcino were celebrating Thursday after Italian police foiled a plot to flood the market with over 220,000 counterfeit bottles of the prized red wine.
A noted wine expert who had obtained fake Brunello and Rosso di Montalcino labels and was able to falsify certification in the region's wine database, was selling lower quality local wine as bulk supplies of the coveted red to unwitting local producers, Siena's financial police said.
"It's the biggest fraud ever carried out in the agricultural and food sector," police chief Luca Albertario said.
Had it succeeded, it would have resulted in fake Brunello di Montalcino wines "ending up on the tables of half the restaurants in the world," Albertario added.
The 160,000 litres of falsified wine would have sold for up to 5.0 million euros ($6.45 million).
Investigators tipped off last year by a suspicious winemaker discovered the conman had targeted up to 10 wineries between 2011 and 2013.
He is also accused of having attempted to steal 350,000 euros from the bank account of one of his victims.
The poor quality wine, which had been stored in barrels to age like the real Brunello, was confiscated earlier this week before it could go on the market.
The oenologist, who has been banned from living in Montalcino, is the only person under investigation so far, though the police said they believed he had been helped by "collaborators in both the wine production and sales sectors, who are currently being identified."
Both the Brunello di Montalcino Consortium of winemakers and the Tuscany region have said they will sue for damages.
According to the Italian Farmers Association Coldiretti, 70 percent of Brunello wine is exported abroad, with the largest slice of the market in the United States, followed by Asia and Central America.
It is the second scandal to hit the Italian wine sector this summer. In May, police busted open a multi-million euro scam in which table wine was being falsely labelled as coming from a winery belonging to famed Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli's estate.

Besides, it plans to begin the construction of its Gujarat plant soon and operationalise the facility by third quarter of next financial year.
"During the early part of next year we will start rolling out new scooters. Two new scooters and one motorcycle model are on the anvil right now," Hero MotoCorp Vice Chairman and Managing Director Pawan Munjal told reporters in New Delhi on the sidelines of SIAM annual convention.
During the upcoming festive season the company plans to introduce 12 refreshed versions of the existing models, he added. "These 12 variants have improved features including engines. All of them would be introduced during the festive season."
When asked about the sales projections during the festive season, Munjal said: "I am bullish about the festival season.
Sentiments have improved and the market will improve further.
We expect to do better than the last year."
The company had sold 6 lakh units during the last year's festival season.
On the company's upcoming Gujarat plant, Munjal said: "We will start construction soon and will launch the facility in the third quarter of next fiscal."
The plant will have an installed capacity of 1.8 million units per annum. The company's current production capacity is 7.65 million units.
Commenting on the proposed plant in South India, Munjal said the company is yet to finalise the site for the facility.
On whether the company is looking at hiking prices, he said: "There is pressure on pricing for sure so there will be some price corrections off and on."
He however did not provide specific details.
Talking about its overseas plans, Munjal said: "We are seriously considering Argentina. Team is going there and doing due diligence. We are sure we will soon find a partner and start operations."
He added that the company will start operations in Brazil in 2016 and is currently working on ethanol powered engines for the market.
On launching products in the US market, Munjal said product homologation process is going on and the entry of the company in the country would happen in 2016 summer.
It would set up distribution in the US but is still to finalise the branding part, he added.

Rs. 3.5 lakh to be paid to kin of the dead as ex gratia
As the flood waters in Srinagar continued to recede on Friday, thousands of people were still trapped in their houses waiting to be rescued and tens of thousands were waiting for food and essential supplies.
The Jammu and Kashmir government announced an assistance package of Rs. 200 crore for those affected but Ministers were still not visible on the ground.
While people were still dealing with the massive floods, the hundreds of carcasses floating around raised fears of an epidemic likely to hit the State once the waters dry.
“We had to row through a stretch of unbearable stench rising from hundreds of dead chickens and dogs and cows,” said Sajad Ahmad, a local volunteer who visited Kanihama area on the outskirts of Srinagar.
The water in the area was still six feet high and Mr. Ahmad said that most of the children stranded with their families in the upper floors of their houses were sick. “If measures aren’t taken on a war footing, a major epidemic awaits us,” he said.
The first instalment of assistance includes Rs. 75,000 to every homeless family for rebuilding houses and Rs. 3.5 lakh ex gratia for the kin of the dead.
On Thursday, the body of a photojournalist, Shafat Sidiq, was found in Batamaloo area with both his cameras still slung around his neck. The government has confirmed the number of deaths at 260.

New Delhi, September 12:  
Global auto majors, including General Motors and Honda, on Friday said the Government should remove ‘obstacles’ and have policies that are more business friendly if India is to successfully achieve Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Make in India’ goal.
They highlighted issues ranging from difficulty in getting business permits to taxation, infrastructure and logistics problems, which they said are hurdles in the growth of the auto industry.
“There are a number of obstacles to doing business in this country. We hope such obstacles will be cleared away under the new leadership of Prime Minister Modi,” Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) Chairman Fumihiko Ike said, while addressing the convention.
Ike, who is also the Chairman of Honda Motor Co, said many Japanese auto parts suppliers “are anxious to establish operations in this country” but face problems.
Nissan Motor Company Senior VP and Chairman for Africa, Middle East and India Takashi Hata said: “Simplify the vendor duty drawback scheme. This (India) is not the easiest country to get this.”
Expressing similar views, General Motors Executive Vice-President Stefan Jacoby said: “To realise the full potential of the industry, we encourage the government to reform overall Central and State taxation policies in a timely manner.”

India is likely to allow Pakistani business people to come to a designated area at the Attari-Wagah border to hold talks with their Indian counterparts.
“Once the trade dialogue is resumed, we will discuss the proposal with the Pakistani side,” Commerce Ministry Joint Secretary Arvind Mehta said. The idea behind the move is to help businesses save time and effort in visiting each other’s countries to discuss business proposals.
Mehta said that the Commerce Ministry has already discussed the matter with other ministries and everybody was on board.

EU wants India to do more on climate changeEU wants India to do more on climate change

Connie Hedegaard
New Delhi, Sept 12:  
European Union wants a shift in the principle of "common but differentiated responsibility" in tackling climate change related issues to one where developing countries, including India, too make higher contributions, Connie Hedegaard, European Union Climate Action Commissioner, said on Friday.
Hedegaard is in India to meet Prakash Javadekar, Minister of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (Independent Charge), ahead of some important international negotiations, such as the UN Climate Summit 2014 to be held in New York in September.
“We believe we have to change the way we see common but differentiated responsibility. Everyone (all the countries including developing nations) must do as much as possible,” Hedegaard said.
She added that some emerging economies have seen enormous growth over the last many years and as a result there was also a differentiated way of dealing with different emerging economies too, holding bigger emerging economies to some binding agreements on issues such as emission cuts.
India and other developing countries have been at loggerheads with the developed countries over what they see as the industrial countries backtracking on promises over critical issues — such as financial aids, technology transfers and others.
Meanwhile, developed countries feel emerging economies need to promise more towards tackling climate change, such as binding emission cuts, adaptation measures and others, which they are not bound to till now.
Pressure has been building on India and China, among other emerging nations to promise emission cuts, even as several developed countries continue to resist such binding contracts.
India and China have both also decided against attending the UN Climate Summit to be held in September in what is being seen as a political message ahead of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to be held in Paris in 2015.
All the signatories are expected to arrive on a binding and universal agreement on climate change efforts at the meeting in Paris and India, along with other developing nations, first wants developed countries to come good on the 2009 Copenhagen pledge to provide up to $100 billion up to 2020 for environmental damage.
Hedegaard said on its part the member States of the EU have delivered on the financial promises made by them and would continue to do so.

J-K: Separatists disrupt army s rescue ops in flood-hit SrinagarSrinagar’s Lal Chowk — the city’s political vantage point — has turned into a watery battlefield for separatists who fear the army’s mammoth rescue mission in the capital could make them cede ground and goodwill.

Lal Chowk has witnessed testy moments since Thursday. Groups, said to be backed by the Hurriyat — the organisation advocating Kashmir’s separation from India — have disrupted army-led operations and even stopped stranded residents from taking their help.
Eventually, they prevented a cautious army from servicing some areas.
The concern of the Hurriyat, which can’t see eye to eye with the armed forces, is that the well-organised rescue and relief operations launched by the armed forces might win hearts and minds of the people.
And although many people are angry — they went without food and water before being rescued — many others are impressed with the army’s job. But whether this will create a lasting bond is anybody’s guess.
Read: ‘It had 12 hours to save lives, but state govt kept sleeping’
“The army team arrived late, but they did come. They saved us,” said Meera Hasnain, a 34-year-old housewife in Rajbagh.
On Friday, men said to be acting at the behest of the Hurriyat opened a community kitchen at Dal Gate. They served rice and lentil soup to nearby residents.
“We will be open as long as you want,” said a volunteer. Incidents of rock-throwing at army rescuers and angry outbursts from those who had to wait a long time to be evacuated have become good opportunities for the separatists to intervene.
But the Hurriyat’s relief efforts have been, at best, symbolic and can hardly match the army’s efforts, aided by non-stop helicopters sorties, boats, food and medical care.
At Lal Chowk on Thursday, army rescuers, sensing a law-and-order situation, made frantic calls to their bosses at 15 Crops, asking what they should do.
They eventually arrested three of the protesters — presumably on orders — which made the rest fall in line.
Such situations have become common in the area around Dal Gate and adjacent Lal Chowk, which reveal the Valley’s deeper fault lines.

Instead of youth  VCs now catching startups ...Fearful of missing the bus, venture capitalists are now catching startups at birth

(Venture capitalists are…)
BANGALORE: Venture capitalists in India are realising that it is better to be an early bird than a late latif when it comes to investing in startups, especially in hot sectors where valuations soar quickly. This is pushing them to take on riskier but smaller bets in earlystage funding rounds of startups as they are apprehensive of missing the bus if they enter later.
Take the case of Manjunath Talwar and Abhijit Khasnis, former Yahoo executives and co-founders of recruitment startup Mynoticeperiod. com, who were close to finalising their first round of funding in July. But instead of closing the round from only a large group of angels, a VC firm approached them with similar terms. Typically, VCs invest in a series-A or B round, not a seed funding round for an eight-month-old startup. The duo decided to keep only select few angel investors in the over-Rs 2 crore funding led by IDG Ventures India that was announced last week.
"VCs have a longer term outlook and deeper pockets to participate in future rounds. It also helped bring in angel investors more quickly, as it makes them comfortable," said 38-year-old Talwar.
The deal highlights the rising interest of VCs in relatively riskier seed deals. IDG Ventures has set up a seed programme, where it will look to make six-seven investments of up to Rs 3 crore in the next 12-18 months. And IDG Ventures is not alone. VC firms such as SAIF Partners and Matrix Partners India have also been actively investing in seed stage over the past 12-18 months. Other VC firms like Helion Ventures, Mayfield and Lightspeed are also looking at such deals.
IDG Ventures' first seed investment was mobile ad retargeting platform Silver-Push in April. "This is a well-defined strategy for us. We will make investment in the initial cycle of our new fund as seed stage investments may take time to mature," said Venkatesh Peddi, vice-president at IDG Ventures. Bejul Somaia, MD at Lightspeed Venture Partners India which has closed three seed deals in the past nine months, said there is increased activity around Internet and mobile. "Another reason is that valuations tend to get high for later stage rounds," said Somaia.
Mayfield, which recently led a seed investment in video interview platform Talview, is also actively eyeing more deals at the stage. The firm recently hired Sweta Aggarwal as venture advisor from Indian Angel Network (IAN) to work on earlystage deals.
 
"Younger entrepreneurs are building companies to sell as compared with family-funded businesses which are built for legacy. They are building companies and products that are smarter, better and cheaper," said Mayfield Managing Director Nikhil Khattau.
Other VCs such as Helion Venture Partners are also looking at the space much more actively.
"We evaluate approximately 80-100 companies each year under serious consideration, which we call priority companies. Earlier 10 per cent of that was from seed, but now that has changed to at least 30-40 per cent of this deal flow," said Ritesh Banglani, partner at Helion, which has $600 million (Rs 3,600 crore) under management.
Experts feel that startups, especially in consumer Internet and mobile, are scaling up much faster and there is increasing competition for deals as well. "A lot of the companies are moving very fast from seed stage to series-A/B and the idea is to identify and get in early in those companies," said Peddi of IDG Ventures.
While earlier participation in seed deals was limited due to management bandwidth at VC firms, entrepreneurs come with better pedigree in company building. Also, mentoring is widely available.
SAIF Partners and Sequoia are roping in angels as mentors while others such as IDG Ventures and Lightspeed are taking board seats and becoming more actively involved with a relatively smaller seed portfolio.
This has meant that VCs now compete directly with angels for certain deals.
"The boundary between an angel investor and venture capital firm is shrinking. At IAN we are doing $1 million (Rs 6 crore) cheques, and angels are also sometimes losing out to VCs in deals," said Sanjay Mehta, a Mumbai-based investor who has backed 23 startups, including online lingerie store PrettySecrets.
But even as more VCs get active in the space, entrepreneurs should be aware of "signalling risk" where startups' ability to raise series-A gets impaired if existing VC decides not to participate in the future round.
Lightspeed's Somaia said while some investors can look at seed investments as an option to participate in series A round, for a startup it can be hurtful. "We have an open dialogue with the entrepreneur that to fund in series A, these will be the expectations that you need to meet," he said.
Helion's Banglani said it's a risk that entrepreneurs need to take, "but benefits of raising seed from an institutional investor outweigh the risks".
Also, entrepreneurs need to be cautious of the capital they take at the seed stage. An angel investor, on condition of anonymity, said while VCs may offer more cash and relatively better valuations, startups should carefully consider large dilutions that may happen with these rounds.

US general Allen to head anti-jihadistcoalitionRetired US general John Allen. ( Source: AP )
PTI | Washington | Posted: September 13, 2014 9:07 am
Retired US general John Allen, the cerebral ex-commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan who also led troops in western Iraq, has been named to lead the international effort against Islamic State extremists, officials have announced.
The job will require a difficult balancing act that will be familiar ground to the retired four-star Marine officer, who has plenty of experience managing unwieldy coalitions and navigating the volatile politics of the Middle East.
Allen, 60, has been an unabashed hawk when it comes to Islamic State, urging a no holds-barred assault on the militants, who have employed brutal tactics in their advance across Syria and Iraq. “The Islamic State is an entity beyond the pale of humanity and it must be eradicated. If we delay now, we will pay later,” Allen wrote in Defense One last month.
As head of the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan from July 2011 to December 2013, Allen had to deal with the notoriously mercurial president Hamid Karzai — as well as commanders from dozens of countries while overseeing the start of a troop drawdown. And before that, as the number two at US Central Command, which oversees American forces in the Middle East, Allen devoted much of his time to tracking America’s arch-foe Iran.
“In this role General Allen will help continue to build, coordinate and sustain a global coalition across the multiple lines of efforts to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL,” said State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf, referring to the jihadists that have seized territory in Iraq and Syria.
President Barack Obama, in announcing a strategy to destroy the group, said the creation of an international coalition that included Arab and Muslim states was vital to the anti-IS effort. Allen’s deputy will be Brett McGurk, the deputy assistant secretary of state for Iraq and Iran.
The former commander will not oversee military operations, which is the job of the current chief of Central Command, General Lloyd Austin. But Allen likely will be asking members of an international coalition to contribute aircraft, ammunition, access to bases or other aid to the fight.
Allen is no stranger to the sectarian politics of Iraq, where he made his name from 2006-2008 in western Anbar province, forging alliances with Sunni tribes who turned on Al-Qaeda militants.
The approach to the Sunni tribal leaders was controversial at the time, and some fellow officers opposed the effort but it proved successful, producing the so-called “Anbar Awakening”.
The Islamic State is an entity beyond the pale of humanity and it must be eradicated.

After the new covers for ‘Charlie and the Chocolate Factory’ launched by its parent company Pengiun UK were dismissed by twitterati as ‘creepy’, the firm's Indian branch has bounced back with its own cover art for new editions of Roald Dahl’s beloved children novel.
The launch is just in time to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the book's publication in 1964, and also the author’s birthday on September 13.
The classic, which has sold over 13 million copies worldwide, will be available in a new avatar — designed by Sir Quentin Blake, who famously illustrated several of the original covers for Dahl’s books.
Blake was also the winner of the international Hans Christian Andersen Award in 2002, the highest recognition available to creators of children's books.
"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is all about imagination, travel and making your dreams come true and we are delighted to celebrate the 50th anniversary of this beloved classic in this very special way,” commented Hemali Sodhi, Publisher, Penguin Random House India, Children’s.
In a cover, styled to resemble a partially unwrapped bar of chocolate, the new edition makes for a delectable sight.
Apart from launching a new edition of the book, Penguin India has also announced, in conjunction with Amazon India, a contest available to children between the ages of nine to 12.
Contestants who correctly answer five questions related to the book on the Amazon.in website will be flown to the UK to see the Roald Dahl museum.
Is this all too much for a book which is half a century old? Amazon India director Samir Kumar doesn’t think so.
"Roald Dahl is one of the most read and cherished authors of children's fiction. Even today his interesting works fascinate children just like 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' that continues to be one of the most popular children's book on our website," he says.
Dahl, regarded as one of the most successful and well known of all children's writers, was born in 1916 in Wales of Norwegian parents. Educated in England, Dahl started work for the Shell Oil Company in Africa.
He began writing after a "monumental bash on the head," sustained as an RAF pilot during World War II. He died in 1990 at the age of seventy-four.
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory continue to be one of his most popular books. It has inspired several adaptations — including a 2005 film directed by Tim Burton, and a long-running Broadway show in the UK.

Liquor discount withdrawn as bars ready for businessUpdated: September 13, 2014 10:24 IST
Liquor discount withdrawn as bars ready for business

On Friday, bar hotels in Kerala removed display boards announcing special discounts on liquor. For a large segment of drinkers, the disappearance of the notice boards was a sign that their favourite taverns might yet survive the “vagaries” of politics and policy-making.
(On Thursday, the Supreme Court had restrained the government from closing down the remaining 312 bars till September 30).
The State government’s decision last month to close down all bars in the State, ostensibly as a precursor to total prohibition by 2024, had forced hotels to dispose of their liquor stock by offering huge discounts. The situation changed overnight on Friday, with buoyant hotel employees thronging State-owned warehouses to stock liquor to meet an anticipated surge in sales.
Excise officials said the demand was highest for cheap rum, brandy and vodka. Kerala has, arguably, the highest rate of hard liquor consumption in the country. Its relatively high rate of suicide and domestic violence has been blamed, routinely, on the “hard drinking habits of its citizens”.
The government’s decision to fast track the State’s path to prohibition had triggered a stormy political controversy. It drew sharp criticism from the Opposition. Certain ruling front leaders, including a Cabinet minister, had also raised objections.
The new liquor policy had also caused major social and religious organisations to take virulently opposite views on the issue.
The arguments centred on whether temperance should be achieved through total prohibition or by creating social awareness. Few intellectuals portrayed the move as an arbitrary attempt on the part of the State to legislate on the personal preference of citizens.
Noted bureaucrats and businessmen have fretted openly that prohibition would signal the end of Kerala as a tourist destination. It would sink its finances, cause more unemployment, fuel the production and sale of cheap bootleg liquor and spawn a new mafia, they said.
On the other side of the social and political spectrum, support has been mounting for the government, especially among women.
Several religious heads and opinion leaders have also argued in support of total prohibition.

Polling begins for West Bengal by-pollsBypolls: Voting begins for 3 Lok Sabha, 33 Assembly seats

Kolkata, Sept 13:  
Voting today began on a brisk note for by-elections to three Lok Sabha and 33 Assembly constituencies spread across ten states, seen as a test for Narendra Modi Government’s popularity, especially as BJP braces for polls in two states next month.
Uttar Pradesh
Amid elaborate security arrangements, polling was being held in 11 Assembly seats and one Lok Sabha seat in Uttar Pradesh, where the stakes are high for BJP. Around nine per cent votes were cast in the first two hours, according to poll officials.
The election comes after the saffron party’s near-total sweep of the 80 seats in Lok Sabha polls just four months ago.
Eleven Assembly seats felt vacant after 10 BJP MLAs and one of its allies Apna Dal were elected to the Lok Sabha.
BJP chief Amit Shah also faces the challenge in UP bypolls as he was credited with the party’s stupendous success.
LS bypolls
The three Lok Sabha bypolls are in Vadodara (Gujarat), Mainpuri (Uttar Pradesh) and Medak (Telangana). Among the Assembly seats, nine in Gujarat, four in Rajasthan, two in West Bengal, five in northeastern states and one each in Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh are going to polls today.
Counting of votes is scheduled for September 16.
Retaining Mainpuri Lok Sabha seat, vacated by SP supremo Mualayam Singh Yadav who had won from two LS seats including Azamgarh, is a matter of prestige for his party. BSP and Congress have not fielded their candidates, leaving a straight contest between Tej Pratap Singh and BJP’s Shiv Singh Shakya.
The 11 Assembly seats in UP, whose outcome may be a pointer to which way the political wind is blowing in the run-up to 2017 Assembly polls, are Saharanpur Nagar, Noida, Thakurdwara, Bijnor, Nighasan, Balha, Sirathu, Rohaniya, Hamirpur, Charkhari and Lucknow East. All of these were vacated by BJP MLAs who won the Lok Sabha elections.
Vadodara LS seat
In Gujarat, Narendra Modi’s successor as Chief Minister Anandiben Patel faces her first big test in by-elections being held today for Vadodara LS seat, vacated by Modi, and in nine Assembly constituencies.
This is the first election in Gujarat in more than 12 years that BJP would be fighting without its star campaigner Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Bypolls in AP
Polling began on a swift note for the by-election to Medak Lok Sabha seat in Telangana and Nandigama (SC) Assembly seat in Andhra Pradesh.
By-election is being held in Medak as the Lok Sabha seat was vacated by Telangana Rashtra Samiti chief K Chandrasekhar Rao upon becoming Chief Minister of the newly-formed Telangana state.
Medak LS seat, once part of undivided Andhra Pradesh and now in Telangana, witnesses a triangular contest between ruling TRS, BJP, and Congress. The bypolls were necessitated as TRS chief and Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao vacated the seat.
On the other hand, TDP is trying hard to prove it won’t be easy to conquer its bastion Nandigama assembly in Krishna district where it is in a direct fight against Congress. The by-election was held due to the death of TDP MLA Tangirala Prabhakara Rao within days of his victory.
Voting was also underway in the lone insurgency-hit Antagarh assembly constituency in Chhattisgarh where only two candidates are in the fray.
West Bengal
In West Bengal, Chowringhee and Dakshin Bashirhat Assembly seats had been won by CPI(M) and Trinamool Congress for which the bypolls are a crucial test for Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s popularity.
Buyoed by its modest gains in Lok Sabha elections in West Bengal and relying on Modi’s charisma, BJP hopes to wrest the Bashirhat Dakshin seat from Trinamool and make its debut in the State Assembly.
Assembly elections will be held in Maharashtra and Haryana in a single phase on October 15.

(When Google launches its…)
BANGALORE: When Google launches its low-cost Android One devices next Monday, Indian users will be able to give voice commands, type messages and use almost all major mobile applications in Hindi. This is because the California, US based internet giant is hoping that the devices, which have been tailor-made for emerging markets, will help it capture the non-English speaking user base in the country.
Over 40 per cent of the population in India lists Hindi as its first language. Android One will come bundled with local language support and users will not have to download any external application to access their smartphone in Hindi, a person with knowledge of the development told ET.
"Google has been constantly working on developing more salience around Indic computing, providing regional language support to users for its various products and services," a Google spokesman said in an email. Internet users in India could increase by nearly a fourth if local language content is provided, according to a 2014 report from Internet and Mobile Association of India and IMRB International.
In rural India, 43 per cent said they would adopt the Internet if they had content in their local language. Local language consumption growth is estimated to be more than four times that of English, according to Google. The company is trying to take a lead over its competitors by taking advantage of this trend.
Google is working to create more Hindi content online through local partnerships and is expected to launch more products keeping the Indic audience in mind.
"So far different vendors were offering different ingredients of the Indian language meal and users were expected to cook it themselves," said Venkatesh Hariharan, founder of Alchemy Business Solutions, a company which works on Indic computing and technology for development.
"If Google offers a comprehensive experience that works out-of-the-box in Indian languages that could attract millions of new users." Indic computing has so far been limited to enthusiasts who had to download a keyboard from one site, a local language dictionary from another and fonts from a third.
"If we really want widespread adoption, then using a mobile phone in Indian languages should be as easy as using it in English," Hariharan said. This is what Google hopes to achieve by introducing devices in partnership with Indian handset makers Micromax, Spice and Karbonn, which will launch the Android One devices for Rs 5,000 to Rs 7,000 next week.
The availability of such devices will also help internet companies such as Facebook and Yahoo promote their products in Indian languages. Facebook currently supports 13 Indian languages. "We are focused on enabling all major Indic languages and on actively promoting them on various platforms," a Facebook spokesperson said.
On the other hand, Yahoo shifted its multilingual support from websites to only mobile apps. For instance, the Yahoo Mail mobile app supports eight Indian languages.
"We can confirm we recently closed down the Indian language sites to better focus on our core offerings," a Yahoo representative said. While experts welcomed Google's push towards Hindi, some want the technologies to be open source.
"Now you'll have some people who will specialise on building Indic computing tools on Google and others doing the same on some other platform," said Sunil Abraham, executive director of Bangalore based research organisation, The Centre for Internet and Society. "At least Google, which seems to have understood and taken advantage of free software, should give back to the free software movement."

An Indian coach of quality will help, says Ravi Shastri
Sep 12, 2014, 04.00AM IST
(Ravi Shastri speaks on a…)
R Kaushik, Wisden India
RAVI SHASTRI has shown both when he was an active cricketer and post retirement that he doesn't just talk the talk, he can walk it too. Fast becoming something of a man for a crisis off the field too, Shastri had a fruitful stint as Team Director during India's limited-overs leg of their recent tour of England, a development that owed itself to the team's meltdown towards the second half of the Test series. In a chat with R KAUSHIK, Shastri speaks at length on a variety of issues, including whether having a Team Director on a permanent basis isn't the way forward for Indian cricket. Excerpts:
When you walked into the Indian dressing room for the first time as the Team Director, what was the morale in the camp like after the drubbing in the Test series?
I was in fact quite surprised at what I encountered. The morale was pretty good, though they were all dejected at how they had played in the last three Test matches. I knew that they were a very good bunch, with super attitude. They just needed some boosting. They were hurting, which you might say is natural, but which was also a good sign as I saw it. When you lose and you don't hurt, then there is a problem.
What did you tell them then—your advice?
I told them, 'I believe in you guys'. The bottom line was that we wanted them to go out and express themselves, to enjoy themselves and play fearlessly. Uske baad agar haar gaye to theek hai, no issues (If we lose after trying hard, then no issues). It was about freeing up the minds, if you like. In that short span of time, nothing more would have been possible.
How did the team react to your presence and that of the new support structure to assist Duncan Fletcher?
It was excellent, the transition was seamless. With (B) Arun, (R) Sridhar and Sanjay (Bangar), the communication was a lot better and that helped Duncan in many ways. Sanjay just finished playing first-class cricket last year, he knew all the players and he knew players from Central Zone particularly well. Arun, he has been at NCA and with India Under-19 for a while now, and he has interacted with most of these boys for a period of time.
Sridhar is an outstanding fielding coach. You could say, by seeing the quality of the fielding in the One-Day International series, that the team took to them. I thought it was the best sustained fielding effort by an Indian team. The fact that all three of them are contemporary was a big help. And it didn't take Arun, Sanjay and Sridhar long to get along with the team, either.
Will it be fair to say that while Fletcher was more cricketing, you were more mind-from-a-backroom perspective?
That's right. There was no overlap of roles whatsoever. Duncan was the main coach, Sanjay and Arun were his assistants. My job was to oversee things. But that didn't stop me from speaking on strategies in team meetings, or technical issues in both group gatherings and on an individual basis.
Bangladesh 2007, England 2014. How do you compare the two assignments?
This was much tougher, without a doubt. That side in 2007 was very experienced. That was more about getting the dressing room settled. The players were mentally very low after what happened in the World Cup (when India failed to progress beyond the first round and Greg Chappell resigned as coach shortly thereafter). But you had experience, loads of it. Plus, the opposition was Bangladesh. This was much, much tougher. It was a far younger side, and the time at hand was very short.
I have watched a lot of the players and have interacted with several of them personally, but to know all of them individually... In that sense, it was a lot easier in 2007. I had played with a couple of them - Sachin (Tendulkar) and Anil (Kumble). This was a little different in many ways but I guess it didn't take long (to get to know the players). That's why I maintain this was more challenging and therefore more satisfying.
  The obvious question—are you in it for the long haul then?
I really have not thought about it. When I was first sounded out, I treated it as a challenge. I said let me go about it and do the job. I have always maintained that I am someone who lives in the present.
I was entrusted with a particular job, and I have gone through that job. It has been a long summer, it has been a challenging summer. I am only coming back to India after a week, I will be on commentary for the Champions League from the 21st. There is enough time to sit back and think about what the future holds.
Is there a case for an Indian coach at some stage in the near future? And maybe make the Director a permanent post?
An Indian coach will help, yes, if there is someone of quality. And if it is a guy of quality, it doesn't matter where he is from, whether he is from India or England or Australia. If there are two candidates of the same quality and one of them is an Indian, then I would go with the Indian. But I would also think a mix would be ideal, like it is now. It can be a great template for the future, it is a perfect mix as it stands.
As for the Team Director on a permanent basis, why not? It will be a nice hand on top as a guide to the players. You don't necessarily have to be involved in the basic intricacies of the game, but with your experience, you can suss certain things and see things that others involved in the day-to-day cricketing activities might sometimes miss.

ApplePay  The disruption that isnt!ApplePay – The disruption that isn’t!

While there has been a lot of speculation and opinions, ApplePay is expected to be a true catalyst in the adoption of mobile payments.
However, ApplePay by itself isn't truly a disruption - as in the case of the iPod or iPhone. Apple's true strength lies in connecting the dots on the business and technology front with a true focus on the end-user experience.
In simple English, ApplePay is a replacement of the physical wallet! It means that plastic cards can now reside in a phone as digital cards. Earlier, a user had a piece of plastic in a physical wallet, now it's an electronic account in their mobile phone. Whereas in the past they might enter a PIN, with ApplePay they press their fingerprint to the phone.
However, the eco-system stays intact. Be it banks, card associations like Visa or MasterCard a merchant acquirer like FirstData or Prizm Payments or a terminal provider like Verifone , they will continue to play their respective roles.
Newer players like Square or Ezetap also have no change in their respective roles or business models, although this might create an opportunity. Apple itself plays no role in the transaction flow other than authentication and transmission of token. It has no visibility into the transaction value or who the merchant is. This ensures their role and at the same time makes their model scalable to all parts of the world.
Apple may charge a fee -- one industry veteran tells me 0.25% -- that may come out of the issuers share - but its more a contractual obligation rather than actually standing in the path of the transaction. It will be interesting to see if Apple bears any liability for possible fraudulent transactions.
While the user experience is awesome, the banking industry partners still have a considerable amount of work to do to upgrade their systems. From experience, this could take anywhere from 6 months to 6 years - which is why MasterCard announced a mandatory migration of terminals by 2020 in the US.
Additionally, the question of whether the issuers and regulators will accept a non-bank like Apple to take the responsibility of authentication remains. Will Indian banks and regulators be comfortable with Apple or any other handset manufacturer doing authentication?
Nonetheless, ApplePay is by far the most well co-ordinated effort in the industry to establish contactless payments using near field communications. The industry that had been given up for dead by cynics has finally got a shot in the arm. The entire industry should see a higher number of electronic transactions and mobile payments - which might yet be Apple's biggest contribution to the ecosystem - but disruption it isn't!
The next few months and years promise to be an exciting time for mobile payments - and Apple Pay will be a catalyst in its adoption.

NEW DELHI: Spice Retail has unveiled its first 'Smartphone Spa', a concept where users can buy skins and other accessories as well as get repairs done for any brand of smartphone.
Spice Retail, which runs a chain of retail outlets under 'Spice HotSpot' brand name, plans to set up similar spas in Bangalore and Kolkata as well.
"People invest good sum of money in buying a smartphone but when it comes to accessories like screen guards and skins, or even customer support, they have to look around for places. Spice Smartphone Spa will be a one-stop shop," Spice Retail Group CEO Prashant Bindal told PTI.
He added that customers will be able to get services starting Rs 100 upwards depending on their choice.
"Even for repair work, customers can drop their devices and we will send it to the authorised service centre," he said.
Asked about the idea behind the concept, Bindal said the move will help the company build loyalty.
"Consumers can come in and get customised skins at affordable prices. We expect a lot of students to come in," he added.
Bindal said after seeing the response, the company will decide on how the concept will be expanded.
"We may have one such spa for a cluster of stores. There is huge potential in cities like Bangalore and Kolkata, we would look at them," he said.

Xi s India visit: Reviving silk route high on agendaChina President Xi's India Visit
(During his summit meeting…)
FUJIAN: Revival of the over 4,000-year-old maritime silk route is high on Xi Jinping government's agenda as it tries to enhance trade and business with countries along the sea route in Southeast Asia and South Asia , including India.
During his summit meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi next week in Delhi, Xi is likely to discuss how India will be a key country in this Chinese strategy for exports both via land and maritime silk routes. Fujian will play a significant part in the grand strategy, sources in Fujian provincial government told a select group of reporters, days ahead of Xi's visit. Sources said firms from Fujian-based enterprises could also be part of landmark industrial parks that China is planning in Gujarat and Maharashtra. Announcement for these parks will be made during Xi's trip.
It is not without any reason that Fujian will be the starting point of maritime silk route. It was the starting point of the ancient maritime silk route.
Also, the Chinese president had spent 17 years from 1985 to 2002 in this coastal province when he undertook major economic reforms, pushed foreign investments and launched poverty alleviation programmes as a Communist Party leader and then governor. Fujian is close to Xi's heart and is one of the hubs for foreign investments. Sources said further strengthening business links between India and Fujian will be on Xi's agenda when he is India.
Fujian is one of the first provinces in China to open up to investments from South Asia, Southeast Asia, Asia-Pacific South Asia. Located the along coast, Fujian has inherent advantages. Many Chinese in Southeast Asian nations and Taiwan have their origin in Fujian.
Besides it has a profound marine culture involving shipbuilding, maritime industry, deep sea shipping and sea food processing industry for 4,500 years. Sources pointed out that there is industrial complementary between Fujian and countries along maritime silk route. IT industry, which is strong pillar of Fujian province, is keen to tie-up with Indian software industry. Star-net Communications, a hardware firm headquartered in Fujian exports routers and advanced switches to India. Also, the province boasts of a very developed textile industry that has international markets. ASEAN countries are natural markets for products in Fujian for their geographical proximity. At present, there are 11 enterprises from Fujian in India and it has invested $67 million in wholesale items, shoes, hydropower and telecommunications.

Government voices optimism ahead of China president Xi Jinping 's visit, eyes investment

( Xi was likely to announce…)
NEW DELHI: Indian officials voiced optimism on Wednesday that a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping next week will open a new chapter in relations between the Asian giants, with hopes high for investment deals to narrow a yawning trade deficit.
Trade minister Nirmala Sitharaman raised expectations ahead of the Sept. 17-18 visit, saying Xi was likely to announce investments in industrial parks and help set the course for smoother cooperation between the two nations.
"We hope that during this visit the Chinese and Indian relationship of the last 50-60 years would see a directional change," Sitharaman told reporters.
She echoed comments from India's National Security Advisor Ajit Doval . Several newspapers quoted him on Wednesday as saying that ties with China could take an "orbital jump" under the leadership of Xi and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi .
Speaking in Beijing, Doval, a hawkish former spy chief who is close to Modi, said the two nations' disputed border would also be discussed on the trip.
Although their commercial ties have rapidly strengthened, the two nations still disagree on where their Himalayan border lies, after China beat India in a war in the region in 1962. To this day, each side claims areas of the other's territory.
INDUSTRIAL PARKS
Trade minister Sitharaman said the government was also in talks with Chinese companies to set up production in India.
China plans to invest some $7 billion in two industrial parks in western India, including one in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state of Gujarat, Indian media reported last week.
Sitharaman signed a memorandum of understanding to establish the industrial parks during a visit to China in July.
On his first day in India, Xi is expected to visit Gujarat, where Modi headed the state government until becoming prime minister in May.
Two-way trade totalled $65.9 billion last year, but $51 billion of that was exports from China. India hopes that Chinese investment in the industrial parks will offset the deficit and help India emulate its neighbour's success as a manufacturing powerhouse.
Sitharaman said she was also seeking greater market access for Indian products and services in the Chinese market. India has struggled to improve export conditions for its pharmaceuticals and IT services.
"We have discussed a range of issues with China. These also included bullet trains. Whether there will a be agreement or not during the visit, you will have to wait for that," Sitharaman told reporters.
Modi has launched a "Make in India" drive since taking office to drum up foreign investment. He came back from a trip to Japan last week with a promise of $35 billion in infrastructure investment.

Cong threatens to take Vinod Rai to court over 2G claims2G claims
(Reacting to Rai's claims,…)
NEW DELHI: Startling allegations from former CAG in the 2G scam have stirred a political fight, with Congress leaders threatening to take Vinod Rai to court. In an interviw to Times Now, Vinod Rai has said that records indicated that the then telecom minister A Raja had kept prime minister Manmohan Singh in the loop on the course of action he planned to pursue in allocating 2G spectrum and that the PM's reluctance to chart a different course could be construed as "dereliction of duty".
Rai told Time Now that he was approached by three Congress MPs - former Law minister Ashwani Kumar who had to resign for allegedly pressuring the CBI to dilute PMO's role in the Coalgate scam, Sanjay Nirupam and Sandeep Dikshit - to drop the name of the Prime Minister from the CAG report on 2G spectrum allocation.
Reacting to Rai's claims, Congress' Sanjay Nirupam said, "Vinod Rai should retract from statement, else I will drag him to court." Rejecting the charge, Nirupam said, "Rai has told an outright lie. I never talked to him. I challenge his memory and want to remind him that I never met him."
The AICC Secretary also claimed he had strongly criticised the CAG at the meetings of the Murli Manohar Joshi-led Public Accounts Committee, which was examining the audit watchdog's report on the 2G Spectrum allocation.
"I also want to remind him that I had attacked the CAG strongly at the PAC meeting and said that the report was a total fraud and politically motivated. I had also said that the CAG should be interrogated by PAC. But Joshiji did not allow it," Nirupam said.
Manish Tewari of Congress also hit back at Rai saying, "Why was he quiet all this time?". Talking on the same lines, Majid Memon of NCP questioned, "Why didn't the ex-CAG Vinod Rai speak till now? Was he waiting for someone's invitation or was he waiting for the government to change?"
Rai, whose book "Not Just An Accountant" is set for release in the next few days, claimed that Dr Singh was alerted by his senior cabinet minister Kamal Nath about the brewing 2G scam.
Adding credibility to Rai's claim, Kamal Nath admitted that he had cautioned Dr Singh against 2G allocations. "I wrote to the Prime Minister that I am hearing all sorts of things are going on in 2G allocation. The PM chose to do nothing," Nath told Times Now.
The former commerce minister said he feels that had Dr Singh intervened "things would have been different for the Congress". However, there was no point flogging a dead horse, said Nath even as he emphasized that "A Raja was prosecuted for what he did", and that Rai should not resort to sensationalism to boost the sales of his book.
 
Latching on to Rai's claims, BJP demanded answers on who was pulling the strings in the UPA government. Sambit Patra of BJP said, "Ex-CAG Vinod Rai's claims prove that Dr Manmohan Singh was just a puppet. People want to know who was the puppeteer?" "Did the 2Gs of Congress -Sonia Gandhi & Rahul Gandhi - stop Manmohan Singh from taking action?" Patra asked.
Rai has said that two letters written by Raja to the PM in 2007 - on November 15 and December 16 - showed that Singh was well aware of what the DMK leader was planning to do.
"...If he had put his foot down, probably the fate and the course of UPA-2 would have been different. If he had put his foot down and stopped this process from unfolding... It could have been any other process, we are not prescribing a process... but this process was faulty in a large number of ways. And the govt has also accepted that rules and regulations were not being followed, goalposts had been shifted..." Rai said in the interview.

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam today rejected as an "outright lie" the claim by former CAG Vinod Rai that along with party members Sandeep Dikshit and Ashwani Kumar he had sought to put pressure on the chief auditor to keep the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's name out of the reports on the 2G and coal-block allocations.
In an interview to 'Times Now', Rai claimed that the then Congress MPs, including Sandeep Dikshit, Sanjay Nirupam and Ashwani Kumar, had sought to put pressure on him to keep the Prime Minister's name out of the said CAG reports.
"That was a futile attempt," Rai said. Rejecting the charge, Nirupam said, "Rai has told an outright lie. I never talked to him. I challenge his memory and want to remind him that I never met him."
The AICC Secretary also claimed he had strongly criticised the CAG at the meetings of the Murli Manohar Joshi-led Public Accounts Committee, which was examining the audit watchdog's report on the 2G Spectrum allocation.
"I also want to remind him that I had attacked the CAG strongly at the PAC meeting and said that the report was a total fraud and politically motivated. I had also said that the CAG should be interrogated by PAC. But Joshiji did not allow it," Nirupam said.
Rai, whose estimates of purported losses in the 2G spectrum and coal block allocations had pushed the then UPA government into a corner, has also criticised former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , saying that integrity is not just financial but intellectual and professional too.
He was also critical of the coalition politics under Singh and suggested that he was more interested in remaining in power.

Online retailers to woo customers with eye-popping dealsAmazon
(Online retailers have…)
BANGALORE: Online retailers, from biggies such as Flipkart and Amazon to niche players like FabFurnish and Bluestone, have lined up special catalogues, exclusive products, offers, contests and discounts to ensure a cracker of a Diwali season, with an eye on first-time shoppers.
Fashion portal Myntra will offer more than 5,000 new products across top brands like FCUK, UCB , Elle, SuperDry, Biba, FabIndia and Antony Moratto for the first time online, while online marketplace Snapdeal.com is working with brands across categories like fashion, electronics and home products to put together a special Diwali catalogue that will be out in the next few days.
Market leader Flipkart will put up exclusive products and offer heavy discounts while rival Amazon.in may introduce drone delivery in the country, as Diwali season is when most number of Indians try out online shopping for the first time. The four to five weeks until Diwali brings the largest sales spike for online sites.
"For online retailers, you can say that the financial cycle is Diwali to Diwali," said Saurabh Srivastava, director at advisory firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) India .
"Every project cycle and launch that an etailer works on during the year is geared only towards Diwali." Srivastava said sales jump during this season can be double the regular daily order size. Sandeep Komaravelly, senior vice president of marketing at Snapdeal, said that unlike offline, Diwali momentum does not taper off in online retail after the festival.
"New customers who have tried online shopping for the first time during the festival season continue to do so even afterwards," he said. No wonder then that portals big and small are going all out to woo new customers, backed by large marketing campaigns.
"For large e-tailers the marketing budgets will be as high as 10% of overall costs," said PwC's Srivastava. Even niche jewellery site Bluestone has set aside Rs 6 crore for advertisement and marketing for the festive season. It will launch a consultancy feature for Diwali that will suggest jewellery items based on the user's face, hair style and likes.
The typical Diwali shopping season starts from third week of September and goes on until Bhai Dooj, two days after Diwali. The online retail industry has grown rapidly in the past few years. While the overall industry was at $1 billion (Rs 6,000 crore) a couple of years ago, just the top three marketplaces in the country—Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon—are estimated to cross $4 billion (Rs 24,000 crore) in sales this fiscal.
Ganesh Subramanian, chief operating officer at Bangalore-based Myntra, which was acquired by Flipkart earlier this year, said it's setting up a special Diwali store on its site. The company has started a new warehouse in Gurgaon in time for the peak shopping period.
"We expect a lot of interest from tier-II and III cities and towns thanks to mobile. At least one out of two orders will be through mobile," he said. Myntra is targeting sales of Rs 2,000 crore this fiscal.
Flipkart plans a single-day big-bang sale a few days before Diwali with new and exclusive products at big discounts, said a person with direct knowledge of the site's Diwali plans. It will also launch exclusive brand partnerships—around one a week—as part of its Diwali line up.
"The company is expecting the largest sales in its seven years of existence," said the person who did not wish to be identified. Flipkart declined to participate in this story. Samir Kumar, director of category management at Amazon India, said the portal will have exclusive launches and innovative gifting options. Amazon could also do drone deliveries in India during the period, as reported earlier by ET. The company declined to speak on this.

Apple Watch  too feminine  looks like it was designed by a student#apple #apple watch #smartwatches
Berlin: Apple's long-awaited smartwatch looks "too feminine" and its design will not stand the test of time, luxury giant LVMH's watch guru has told German media.
Jean-Claude Biver, who heads the French group's luxury-watch division, said the US tech titan had made "some fundamental mistakes" designing the Apple Watch.
"This watch has no sex appeal. It's too feminine and looks too much like the smartwatches already on the market," Biver said in an interview with daily Die Welt.
Apple's long-awaited smartwatch's design will not stand the test of time, luxury giant LVMH's watch guru has told German media.
"To be totally honest, it looks like it was designed by a student in their first trimester," added Biver, who heads up the brands Tag Heuer, Zenith and Hublot.
Biver predicted the much-anticipated device, with its square face and curved edges, would soon be outdated.
"Luxury always has something timeless, it's rare and conveys prestige," he was quoted as saying, adding that the same could not be said for Apple Watch, which is expected to be bought by millions of customers and will likely be beyond repair in a few years' time.
Biver is not the first watch chief to be dismissive of Apple's efforts. Swatch CEO Nick Hayek earlier told Swiss media that the world's biggest watch group was "not nervous" about Apple's foray into the market.
Apple Watch, which comes in several colours and links to the iPhone, will start at $349 (270 euros) when it is released early next year. The wrist device is the first new product category to be launched by Apple since the death of co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011.

Samsung to launch two premium devices, Galaxy Alpha and Galaxy Note 4, to take on Apple iPhone 6

ET Special: All you want to know about Apple iPhone 6
BANGALORE: South Korean phonemaker Samsung, which has been losing market share to rivals in India, is gearing up to launch two premium devices — the Galaxy Alpha and Galaxy Note 4 — to take on the new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. The company has started talking to distributors and retailers to launch these devices in time for Diwali, ahead of the launch of the Apple devices in October.
Unlike previous Samsung phones that were clad in a plastic body, these will be the first Samsung phones with an external metal casing, something that iPhones have had for long. Priced a little over Rs 40,000 a piece, the Galaxy Alpha is expected to be cheaper than the new iPhone 6 but will have better features, an offline distributor briefed on Samsung's plans said.
The Galaxy Alpha, showcased by Samsung last month, has a partial metallic body, 4.7-inch screen and a top-of-the-line processor. It's the company's bet against iPhone 6 in the premium segment.
Samsung also announced the allnew Galaxy Note 4 with a 5.7-inch screen at IFA, the consumer electronics show in Berlin earlier this month. While Samsung has had big screen phones for a long time, the iPhone 6 Plus would be Apple's first such big device.
Apple's iPhones have traditionally been smaller in size. In 2010, when Apple was selling the iPhone 4, its iconic founder Steve Jobs had mocked rivals making big phones by saying that people won't buy phones if they couldn't even wrap their hands around them. Tim Cook , who took over Apple after Jobs' untimely death three years ago, has positioned the new iPhone 6 devices as phones that are "bigger than bigger".
Samsung didn't pass over the opportunity to take a dig at Apple. The South Korean company tweeted on Wednesday: "Big improvements and innovation come with change — even they thought so."
Samsung also released a graphic which actually quoted Steve Jobs: "No one is going to buy a big phone." It went on to add, "Guess who surprised themselves and changed their minds." With nearly 28 per cent market share, Samsung is the largest selling smartphone brand in the country followed by homegrown Micromax.
However, in the premium segment, it faces stiff competition from Apple's iPhone.

Pune becomes new hub for global banks’ back offices

(Pune, known as a BPO hub for…)
MUMBAI: A month ago, 30-year old Kaushik Bose (name changed), a consultant with EY in Mumbai, quit his job to relocate to Pune where he joined the back office of a global investment bank. Bose was prompted to make the shift to Pune from the city where he has lived, studied and worked for the past 10 years. The draws: a better quality of life, including cheaper rentals, a home close to the workplace, scope for more family time and net savings from the better cost of living.
Several professionals across levels are making Pune their home. The city, known as a BPO hub for information technology majors, is now a hot destination for back offices of global banks, which are set to witness a hiring boom in the next 18-24 months.
An estimated 5,000 people across levels will be hired at the global in-house centres (GICs) of Citibank, Deutsche Bank, Barclays, Credit Suisse, BNY Mellon among others in the period, according to executive search firm estimates. Pune has many factors working in its favour. Topping this list is its proximity to the commercial capital Mumbai - it is barely a threehour ride from the megapolis.
"Pune as a destin a t i o n h a s gained growing importance in the past few years due to the development of the city's infrastructure, which has made it an attractive location for talent as well corporates," says Vikram Subrahmanyam, head of operations and technology at Citi South Asia.
"Pune is set to see a big pick-up in hiring with about 5,000 additions to GICs in the next 18 to 24 months, says Puneet Pratap Singh, partner-incharge, New Delhi at search firm Heidrick and Struggles. He estimates that at the leadership level hires, Pune will eventually help companies to save around 10 per cent on compensation.
Pune is the preferred choice for talent not only from Mumbai and other parts of Maharashtra, but also from cities like Bangalore, Gurgaon, Hyderabad and Calcutta. From the standpoint of companies, it is an attractive destination due to the cost advantage in terms of real estate, as well as people.
Rentals in Pune, for instance, are 40 per cent to 50 per cent lower than those in Mumbai, says Anuj Puri, chairman and India country head of Jones Lang LaSalle, a global real estate services firm.
"Mumbai is becoming untenable for most people with commuting getting increasingly tougher and a very high cost of living.With several bank back offices setting up shop in Pune and strengthening their manpower, it is good that it will set up a talent pool," says K Sudershan, managing partner — India and regional VP — Asia, EMA Partners International. Adds Singh, "To move talent from Mumbai to Pune, companies have to offer a 15 per cent to 20 per cent hike on base compensation compared with 25 per cent to 30 per cent that they might normally offer. However, the bigger positive impact will be attrition management and real estate cost advantage."
The city has an existing presence of IT product and services organisations, as also captives. "The willingness of the talent base to relocate to Pune is also due to the good quality of residential infrastructure and relatively lower commute time," says Subrahmanyam. Attractive SEZs and good corporate infrastructure with the availability of quality talent has made Pune an attractive destination for corporates to set up their GICs.
The city is also relatively more cosmopolitan compared with emerging locations like Chennai, Hyderabad, says Dhvani Anjaria, specialist for support functions hiring at Vito India Advisors, a BFSI search firm. For Citibank, Pune is becoming very strategic, with its global inhouse centre Citi Technology Center planning to scale up staff strength to 2,500 from 1,200. "The plan is to continue to leverage the availability of the city's large talent base," says Subrahmanyam.
  The current talent base at Citi's GIC in Pune has professionals from Mumbai, Delhi, NCR, Bangalore, Hyderabad and other cities. Around 8 per cent employees have moved from Delhi and NCR, 10 per cent from Bangalore, 7 per cent from Hyderabad and other cities. Deutsche Bank, which is the latest to set up its back office — DBOI Global Services India — in Pune this year, has moved about 600 people from Mumbai, an industry source said. DBOI refused to share numbers though.
"Pune is an attractive destination for banks' in-house centres. We recently set up a centre in Pune and are pleased with its build out and growth. Our staffing is a mixture of local hiring of talent as well as some colleagues who relocated to Pune from our Mumbai office," says Manoj Yadav, managing director and head of Deutsche Bank Group's in-house centre for India.
Facilities and living comforts apart, Pune also has a high availability of talent across business areas. "Pune has a large number of world class educational institutions and hence there is a constant supply of high quality talent which is absorbed by companies based there," says Yadav. "Candidates from across different cities with experience in functional areas such as operations, finance and technology were open to moving to Pune," he adds.
"With urban infrastructure, moderate cost of living and good governance, Pune has all it needs to attract employees. It's also known as the Oxford of the East, with ample colleges and schools for children's education," says an HSBC spokesperson.

NEW DELHI: Pragna Kolli makes for an unusual candidate at The Wharton School of The University of Pennsylvania. Currently, in her second year of MBA at the Ivy League business (B) school, she was the first woman to have worked on long distance trains in South India. Kolli was a train ticket examiner (TTE) on moving trains as well as a squad TTE on the ground conducting supply checks, her profile, in stark contrast to the scores of Wall Street devotees and IIT engineers with stellar scores and pedigree competing with each other for a seat at the B-school every year. Consultancies by alumni of top B-Schools helping aspirants
"Forget global exposure, I didn't even have corporate exposure early on," said Kolli who had done her long distance undergraduate education from Osmania University . Hailing from a modest background, Kolli had worked on trains since she was 17. She has travelled thus far thanks to Admissions Consulting firm Admissions Gateway, run by Kellogg alumnus Rajdeep Chimni.
Kovid Gupta, a former scriptwriter with Balaji Telefilms, also wanted to study in a top B-school. But he found it difficult to articulate his own professional long-term vision and expectations from B-schools in his application essays. He approached Mumbai-based admissions consultancy ReachIvy. Today, he's studying at Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell.
Kolli and Gupta are among hundreds of Indians with diverse backgrounds and work experience who are increasingly turning to specialist admission consultancies such as ReachIvy, Admissions Gateway and PythaGurus to realise their dream of doing MBA at a top global business school. Run by alumni of top notch B-schools, these firms help students through the exhaustive process of applying to global B-schools, and assist in honing their applications through coaching on resume writing and essays. Rising awareness of global MBA education, an increase in GMAT applications and a growing emphasis on diversity in global B-schools have convinced an increasing number of Indian candidates to seek expert help for applying at top B-schools.
"I realised that given the immense competition, Indian applicants need to be smarter about positioning themselves, have to network better and communicate well. Having gone through a hard time before succeeding enables me to put myself in the applicants' and re-applicants' shoes, and understand them better," said Rajdeep Chimni , who founded Admissions Gateway.
After failing to get through any top B-school in 2005 despite having a high GMAT score, Chimni reapplied in 2006 and gained six admissions with scholarships, which inspired him set up a firm to assist Indian students crack the world's top 15 B-schools the very next year.
Admissions Gateway, which has advisors such as spiritual guru Deepak Chopra and American venture capitalist and Booth alumnus Venetia Kontogouris on its board, helps Indian candidates understand and position their unique life and work experience in their resume, essays and interviews.
Chimni said around 33per cent of Admissions Gateway's applicants have been making it to top Bschools like Stanford and Wharton over the past few years. He said client intake has increased 45per cent over the last two years.
Ahigh GMAT score is a significant though not the sole precursor of landing a seat in an Ivy League B-school. Applications can be stretched and exhausting, with each school demanding different statements of purpose and intent in addition to a compelling work experience, and other additional accomplishments.
Vibha Kagzi, a Harvard Business School graduate who founded ReachIvy right after her graduation in the summer of 2011, like Chimni, was inspired by her own experience. "My undergraduate experience was a shot in the dark. I felt if someone had provided me structured help at the time of applying, I could have managed to get through a better university at the undergraduate level as well," said Kagzi, a Carnegie Mellon undergraduate.
Gurgaon-based PythaGurus, co-founded by former Accenture consultant and Darden School of Business alumnus Jatin Bhandari, has serviced applicants from Rohtak, Ambala and Chandigarh. The firm, which helped 5-7 applicants when it started out in 2009, is working on 70 applications this year. Bhandari said his firm had helped place students in schools like Insead, Wharton, London Business School and Tuck School of Business for the current academic year.

The talent demand in the hospitality industry is higher than high volume industries such as IT, BPO, Retail and BFSI. As per TimesJobs.com data, hotel professionals have the highest number of jobs in the industry.
The Travel and Hospitality industry reported a 15 per cent growth in demand for talent, as per RecruiteX (July 2014), the recruitment report from TimesJobs.com.
In a month-over-month analysis, the talent demand in the industry is higher than high volume industries such as IT, BPO, Retail and BFSI.
"There are many jobs available in the hospitality industry in every function for the right candidate. We are facing a huge shortage of talent," informed Soraya Rebello, VP-HR, Jakson Hospitality during a High-Tea session, a career chat platform on TimesJobs.com.
Demand for hospitality professionals recorded a 30 per cent increase in a month, reports RecruiteX (July 2014). Their demand is driven by tourism and food services sector. There are jobs available for hospitality professionals in distinct sectors such as Consulting Services and BPO.
As per TimesJobs.com data, hotel professionals have the highest number of jobs in the industry.
Business development professionals have the second highest share of jobs in the sector. In fact, there has been growth in hiring of top management professionals in the industry. They account for 3 per cent of the total jobs in the hospitality function on TimesJobs.com.
In the experience-wise analysis, the maximum numbers of jobs in the industry are available in the experience range of 0-2 years and 2-5 years.
Delhi-NCR: The hottest location
Among all the major metros, Delhi-NCR tops the demand chart for hospitality professionals followed by Mumbai and Bangalore, according to the TimesJobs.com data. Pune also has a fair share of jobs for hospitality professionals.
Talking about job opportunities available for hospitality professionals outside India, Rebello mentioned that the hospitality jobs are available in plenty around the world.
"Opportunities are higher for entry level positions or in the first five years. At senior management levels, some countries still prefer to have foreigners or locals from their own countries."
Middle East is the best location to work outside India as it has the maximum job opportunities according to the data.
According to Rebello, employees in the hospitality industry are compensated fairly well. "The compensation for entry level positions is a little lower when compared to engineering or IT sector. However, the compensation grows with experience, the city one has worked in and the size of the hotel. Management level salaries start at Rs 5 lakh annually and can go upto Rs 1 crore or even higher depending on the level of hierarchy. The increments in 2014 have been around 10 per cent on an average."

US threatened Yahoo with $250 000 a day fine over surveillance#yahoo #nsa #online surveillance
Washington: US authorities threatened to fine Yahoo $250,000 a day if it failed to comply with a secret surveillance program requiring it to hand over user data in the name of national security, court documents showed Thursday.
The documents, made public in a rare unsealing by a secretive court panel, "underscore how we had to fight every step of the way to challenge the US government's surveillance efforts," Yahoo general counsel Ron Bell said in a blog post.
The documents shed new light on the PRISM program revealed in leaked files from former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.
US authorities threatened to fine Yahoo if it failed to comply with a secret surveillance program requiring it to hand over user data.
The program allowed US intelligence services to sweep up massive amounts of data from major Internet firms including Yahoo and Google.
Bell said 1,500 pages of documents were ordered released by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in the case dating from 2007. He said that in 2007, the government "amended a key law to demand user information from online services."
"We refused to comply with what we viewed as unconstitutional and overbroad surveillance and challenged the US government's authority," he said.
Yahoo's court challenge failed and it was forced to hand over the data. The court records were kept sealed.
"At one point, the US government threatened the imposition of $250,000 in fines per day if we refused to comply," Bell said.
Since the Snowden leaks, Yahoo and others have been seeking to make public these court documents to show they were forced to comply with government requests and made numerous attempts to fight these efforts.
The opening of these court dockers to the public "is extremely rare," Bell said, adding that the company was in the process of making the 1,500 pages publicly available online.
"We consider this an important win for transparency, and hope that these records help promote informed discussion about the relationship between privacy, due process, and intelligence gathering," Bell added.
But he said that "despite the declassification and release, portions of the documents remain sealed and classified to this day, unknown even to our team."

We have a dedicated strategy in India: Mary Barra  GMChevrolet
(Mary Barra, GMs’ first…)
Mary Barra, General Motors' first woman CEO, says the auto maker isn't bothered about the past and is focused on the future. In an interaction with the media in New Delhi - held between two meetings she had with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Commerce Minister Nirmala Seetharaman - the 34-year GM veteran fielded questions with elan. When asked what went wrong with GM in India, with a less than 3per cent market share after 18 years and $1 billion of investment, she said "a lot of things went right too in India".
Striving to make a new beginning in Indian operations that have been plagued with alleged technical fudging and safety recalls, Barra said GM plans to start afresh with the Indian unit as an export base, shipping its first car to Chile. Exports to Mexico and Colombia are also on the cards. Edited excerpts:
On General Motors in India and the way forward...
It starts with putting customers at the centre. In India, they have great options and choices. We came to India with vehicles that are great in quality and also bear a good life-time experience.
We were one of the foremost auto makers to start assembly operations as early as 1928 in India. Our two plants in Halol in Gujarat and Talegaon in Maharashtra have seen a cumulative investment of over $1 billion. We have put efforts in India to develop new products with a technical centre for not just the local market but also for global applications. We make sure we understand the customers and develop the right vehicles.
We want GM to be a highly respected, valued company in India and also globally with year after year of growth. We had our global chairman Tim Solso and head of international operations Stefan Jacoby, along with our CFO (Chuck Stevens), in India to demonstrate our commitment and belief in India's future.
On charges of corporate fraud against the company and the strategy to bring back confidence to the Indian unit...
India is a key strategic market with a great opportunity from the market perspective. There is a huge focus to improve quality across the market we operate in. Our global team visited the Indian plants to improve the quality of our vehicles and product assessment to bring some dramatic improvements.
General Motors operations have seen some quality issues and the integrity of vehicles that were the result of the decisions taken many years ago. We are looking forward to deal with the situation just like in America where we are taking it very straight forward and did the right thing.
On new initiatives...
We have a relatively new leadership team in India with Stefan (Jacoby) in charge. We are really focused and have put five key initiatives globally and for the Indian market. The customers as the main centre of our operations are there for the entire lifetime. We understand the importance of brands that grow with the customer.
Our global brands are Chevrolet and Cadillac. In India, we are here with Chevrolet that is a great brand in terms of value and we want to introduce model after model and products in this brand. We also want to be a leader in technology and innovation that truly create value for the customer in terms of fuel efficiency or safety or connectivity and any aspect of the vehicle.
Future product lineup...
We plan to introduce 40 new products across the international market, including India. We would be brining 14 new products in the US and 27 models in the Opel brand in the European market. Also, we plan to bring 17 new and upgraded models in China. On GM India's strategy to bring
Chinese vehicles from partner Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC), a step that has not fared well...
We have a significant partnership still with SAIC in China. And we assessed and in that cases we did not have the right focus in understanding the right product to the Indian market. We had some quality challenges that have been assessed. We have not closed the books. We have a wealth of products in the General Motors family and need to identify the future models. I'm not here to make any product announcement today. We are here to drive success for the entire company including India that makes us a strong organisation globally.
  India's contribution to overall volumes...
We see it as a significant market as the industry is going to grow. We think there is an opportunity to grow and we are here to evaluate, also from an overall share perspective as well. We don't have any specific targets.
On transformation at GM...
We have a very strong leadership team. We have a good balance sheet. We have showed across markets that we have superior products. We have a well-defined game plan. In India, we have a dedicated strategy.

Educating farmers can bring down cultivation cost: Radha Mohan SinghYou are here: Home > Collections > Farmers
Cost of cultivation will come down when farmers get educated, says Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh

(Cost of cultivation will…)
Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh expects many parts of India to increase productivity by 50 per cent-100 per cent with the optimum use of fertilizers, after scientific analysis of farmland, better seeds and irrigation. He is also determined to increase production of oilseeds to reduce the import of vegetable oils that cost the country about Rs 60,000 crore a year. In an interview with ET's Madhvi Sally and Himangshu Watts, the minister also spoke about how the urea subsidy can be cut by 25 per cent with proper use of fertilisers after chemical analysis of the soil. Edited excerpts:
How will you balance the farmer's demand to get higher prices and the consumer's concern of food inflation?
We need to raise crop yields and reduce the farmer's expenditure on farming. This will give good returns to farmers and also ensure consumers get affordable rates. Cost of cultivation will come down when the farmer is educated. We are issuing soil health cards to help him know exactly how much fertiliser is needed. We will set up soil health labs across the country and even provide mobile labs. We will also give best quality seeds to farmers and improve water availability.
What will be the impact on production?
This will have dual benefit. Urea subsidy is Rs 80,000 crore. Its consumption will come down by 20 per cent-25 per cent after farmers know they need not use too much of it. Secondly, with proper use of fertilisers and better seeds, production can increase by 50 per cent to 100 per cent. In some pockets, productivity has already doubled but this has to happen across the country. States like Gujarat have already demonstrated how yields can jump. Availability of water also helps. If you look at Punjab, which has the maximum deficit rainfall this year, it has seen higher kharif planting than previous year due to good irrigation.
Don't we have good high-yield variety seed in the country?
It is there but the speed to move them from labs to land is slow. We have just notified 48 new variety of seeds and will ensure they are in fields soon. We also want officials from universities, research institutes and agriculture students to go to fields and help make a policy on that.
How do you see agriculture growth?
This year, since our government has been formed, there was a dry phase and then floods. This is a big challenge. But crop planting has improved a lot. We will know the final picture later.
In 2019, when you go in public, what are you aiming to show?
The year 2019 is far away. In next one year you will see that mobile laboratory will start issuing soil health cards. In next 2-3 months, we will launch a national organic farming scheme for the country. You will see growth in organic farming.
There is, however, a problem of small and marginal farms where mechanisation is a challenge. How do you plan to help this segment?
Small and marginal farmers account to 86 per cent in the country. Irrigated land only accounts to 44 per cent, with most small farmers don't have irrigation services. We will focus on farmers with land of one acre and less and hence include small farmers in our fold. Our aim is to come with policies which help increase farmers' income.
How much will the erratic monsoon rains impact the kharif production?
Initially, we were concerned when there was deficit. Current data till September 5 shows there is 3 per cent less sowing than previous year. In some districts in some states there will be some impact. Sowing will continue till September 15 and I expect that sowing will be similar to the previous year.
Will this impact production?
When the season started, we all thought sowing might not even be 50 per cent, but now it is much better. Only at later stage we can get to know what production will be. So, we have to wait for the figures to come.

Proposal for NSEL merger into FTIL might go to JaitleyBS Reporter |  New Delhi Sep 12, 2014
Last Updated at 10:45 PM IST
Proposal for NSEL merger into FTIL might go to Jaitley
According to Section 396 of the Companies Act, 1956, the Centre can order merging of two companies if it is essential in the public interest
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley might have to step in to decide on the Forward Markets Commission (FMC)’s proposal to merge scam-hit National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL) with its parent, Financial Technologies India Ltd (FTIL).
It is learnt the finance ministry is backing the proposal but the ministry of corporate affairs (MCA), also headed by Jaitley, has reservations. “We have sought the finance ministry’s views,” said a senior MCA official.
In August, FMC wrote to MCA to merge the now-defunct NSEL with its promoter and 99 per cent owner, FTIL. The Jignesh Shah-promoted spot exchange had defaulted on payment of Rs 5,574 crore to depositors.
According to Section 396 of the Companies Act, 1956, the central government can order merging of two companies if it is essential in the public interest. As the issue of “public interest” is not clear in this matter, MCA decided to ask the finance ministry for its view. The final word on this rests with MCA and Jaitley, being the minister for both, can iron out the issues.
“FMC has suggested the two be merged under the Companies Act. It is one option to protect the interest of investors,” said a finance ministry official who did not wish to be named.
The FMC proposal was made after some investors met Minister of State for Finance Nirmala Sitharaman and suggested the merger as an option.
“FTIL, being the parent, should take the full responsibility. But this parent-child relationship is a grey area. The parent can argue it is a separate legal entity,” said a government official.
According to experts, there is no precedent where such power was exercised by the government to merge a private company into a listed one. The government has used its powers under the Companies Act on amalgamation of companies in cases related to public sector enterprises. Experts say a case can be made for these two companies to be amalgamated in the public interest, since the money of 13,000 investors in NSEL is at stake. However, “merger of NSEL with FTIL might be seen as transfer of NSEL liabilities to FTIL, detrimental to the 58,000 public shareholders of FTIL, especially when the money that investors lost on NSEL had gone only to 24 borrowers of the exchange, as stated in the police chargesheet against Jignesh Shah, promoter of FTIL”.

Grand Central on the PotomacCommentary by Steven Pearlstein
Published on September 12, 2014
According to urban legend, the opening of Verizon Center in 1997 was the catalyst for the revival of Washington’s old downtown. Ever since, a string of projects — National Harbor, Nationals Park, the Silver Line — have promised to “change the face” of the city or the region.
While such assessments involve more than a bit of hyperbole, one project that has received scant attention could well be the biggest game changer of all.
ABOVE: Union Station has separated adjoining neighborhoods for a century, even as new buildings rise around it. A plan to build over the tracks would knit the sides back together. (From left, images from Library of Congress, Pictometry, Aramark)
I’m talking about the proposed expansion and redevelopment of Union Station, which could do for Washington what Grand Central Terminal did for New York a century ago — create a new commercial epicenter for the city and provide the transportation anchor for a regional economy, stretching from Richmond to Baltimore. At $10 billion in public and private investment, it would represent the region’s most important development initiative since the construction of Metro’s subway system.
Anyone who has passed through Union Station during rush hour knows that it is bursting at the seams, with 100,000 train, bus and subway passengers jostling for space most days with workers from nearby offices, shoppers and tourists from Dubuque.
Anyone who has watched the steady march of downtown development in Washington from the West End to the East will understand the significance of a project that finally binds up the gash that was cut through the city more than a century ago to make way for the railroad tracks connecting Washington to cities north and west.
And surely anyone who has endured the 90-minute commute each way from the exurbs of Maryland and Virginia will see the economic logic of locating more workers within a 10-minute walk of a modern, multimodal transportation hub.
If you’ve been to the renovated St. Pancras Station in London, or the spectacular Atocha station in Madrid, or even to the recently restored Grand Central, you have a sense of the world-class facility that Amtrak, the Union Station Redevelopment Corp. (USRC) and the developers at Akridge have in mind:
A seven-story-high train shed covered by a glass roof that lets in plenty of natural light. Wide spacious platforms between trains located on two levels of track. Elevated and underground passenger concourses, lined with shops and restaurants, providing easy access to subway, buses, taxis, streetcars, parking and street exits in all directions. Waiting areas, concierge stations, and electronic departure and arrival boards distributed throughout the station.
“Trains as theater” is how Amtrak design consultant Brian Harner thinks of it, harking back to a romantic era of train travel — only this time with cleaner, quieter electric trains, moving walkways and escalators, and automated ticket machines.
This new Union Station would go well beyond the ambitions of Daniel Burnham’s original Beaux-Arts masterpiece. Its footprint would span 10 square blocks —  two blocks east to west, five blocks north to south, from the foot of Capitol Hill to K Street. And to accommodate the additional parking, the underground concourses, the new bus and Metro stations and new tracks for high-speed rail, the complex would extend five levels underground.
Directly above the tracks, a whole new neighborhood of offices, hotels, residences and shops would be constructed around an elevated plaza bisected by the new H Street streetcar. Along the western edge of the project, an elevated bike and walking path, planted in the manner of New York’s High Line, would run north to Silver Spring. Along the east, perhaps an open-air market serving both commuters and nearby residents of Capitol Hill.
It speaks to the paucity of our civic imagination, and the small-mindedness of our politics, that simply to describe a project of such ambition is to invite the knowing smirks and raised eyebrows of those who will immediately recognize it as wholly incompatible with the current political and budgetary environment. It’s hard to imagine a project more likely to raise the tea party’s hackles than having federal and state taxpayers borrow billions of dollars to increase subsidized train service in and out of Washington.
At the same time, broader economic forces make Union Station expansion almost inevitable. As Doug Allen, the head of the Virginia’s commuter rail service, put it, “The question is how we do it, not whether we do it.”
With the era of exurban sprawl having run its course, people and jobs are moving back to more densely populated urban areas. That’s happening not just in Washington, but also in Boston, Austin, Seattle, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Miami. The only way these cities can accommodate such growth, and realize the economic efficiency that it will generate, is to dramatically improve their public transportation infrastructure and increase the density of land use around key public transportation nodes.
“Right now we are only scratching the surface in terms of the economic potential of Union Station,” said David Tuchmann, who is managing Akridge’s part of the project.
An expanded Union Station could create a new commercial epicenter for Washington and provide the transportation anchor for a regional economy.
On the rails, an economic engine
Grand Central Terminal celebrated its 100th anniversary last year, and its history speaks to the influence that a train station can have on the economy and topography of a metropolis.
Railroad magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt constructed the original Grand Central in the 1870s on a railroad storage yard and cow pasture on what was then the outskirts of New York City. It was the biggest railroad station ever built in the United States, linking the city to its far suburbs and the country to the west. The depot was so remote that passengers traveled almost an hour by horse-drawn trolley to get to it from what was then the downtown in Lower Manhattan. Vanderbilt’s gamble was that if he built the station, New York would grow up around it.
The Oyster Bar, top, draws visitors to newly renovated Grand Central Terminal in New York. Soaring renovations to Madrid's Atocha station, middle, and London's St. Pancras are a model for planners' visions for Union Station.                                                                            (Mario Tama/Getty; Daniel Ochoa de Olza/AP; Simon Dawson/Bloomberg)
That is exactly what happened. As the city developed northward, traffic in and out of the new station grew so rapidly that it had to be expanded several times. Before long, there was a growing chorus of complaints from the owners of nearby houses and offices about noise and filth and danger to pedestrians. The clamor eventually forced the New York Central to construct a tunnel down the middle of Park Avenue to carry most of its trains in and out of the city, and a modern terminal at the end of it, at 42nd Street, that the world knows today as Grand Central.
The new station and train yards consumed nearly 50 acres and were constructed over a decade at a cost of $2 billion in today’s dollars. It was the first station to have clean, electrified trains arrive on two levels of underground track, one for commuter trains, the other for long-distance service like the luxurious 20th Century Limited to Chicago. The station had the capacity to handle more than 1,000 railcars at any given time, with 30 platforms reached by ramps and underground concourses.
Once in the station, ladies and gentlemen could go to separate waiting rooms and lounges to have their hair cut, have their shoes shined or change into a fresh outfit. Restaurants on the mezzanines overlooked the marbled main concourse, and the now famous Oyster Bar below.
The majestic main concourse was 275 feet long and 120 feet wide, flanked on both ends by grand marble staircases, underneath a massive concave ceiling on which was painted the constellations of the stars. The New York Times, in a special section, proclaimed the newly opened Grand Central to be the world’s greatest train station, “a monument, a civic center or, if one will, a city.”
From its inception, however, Grand Central was more than a train station — it was a real estate development project. New York Central’s original investment was premised on its ability to develop or sell the air rights for the land around the terminal building once the underground tracks and platforms had been completed and covered. According to Sam Roberts, the New York Times columnist who wrote a book on the occasion of Grand Central’s centennial, the assessed value of property in the immediate area around the station more than doubled within three years of construction. A decade  later, it had doubled again, creating a huge return for Vanderbilt and his railroad and a bonanza for the city’s economy.
With Grand Central as its anchor, Midtown Manhattan became the commercial, residential and cultural heart of New York. The great hotels of the era, including the Ambassador, the Biltmore, the Commodore and the Waldorf-Astoria, sprang up,  while many of the nation’s biggest corporations moved their headquarters uptown to the nearby Chrysler Building, Empire State Building and ornate New York Central Building. For apartment living, Park Avenue became one of the city’s most prestigious addresses — by 1920, it was reported that 100 millionaires were living at the single address of 270 Park. And where the swells came, their clubs and nightclubs and favorite restaurants soon followed.
Grand Central’s economic impact was also felt in the suburban commuter towns that sprouted along the tracks leading away from the city — towns such as White Plains and New Rochelle in New York and Greenwich and Darien in Connecticut. These suburbs also became part of the city’s economic ecosystem, and without them, New York would never have become the economic engine it is today.
When Akridge bought the development rights in 2002, Union Station was in decline, and “NoMa was a wasteland,” the firm's founder says. Today, booming neighborhoods encircle the station.
Lengthening D.C.’s reach
Lots of things, of course, have changed since 1913, but the history of Grand Central can be instructive in thinking about the potential impact of an expanded and revitalized Union Station.
Imagine you are an employer looking for office space in Washington for a professional staff drawn from all over the region. Would any location be more accessible to more workers? And, once high-speed rail service is introduced in the Northeast, would any other location in Washington make it possible to get to meetings in downtown Baltimore in 30 minutes or New York in 90 minutes?
The Union Station area is already among the hottest in the region, with NoMa to the north and west and the hip H Street corridor to the north and east. These neighborhoods are only likely to get hotter once ground is finally broken on a long-delayed, mixed-use development over Interstate 395 where it crosses under Massachusetts Avenue NW, repairing another gash in the urban fabric that isolates Union Station from the rest of downtown. Redevelopment of the historic red-brick Government Printing Office, hard by the station on North Capitol Street, will add to the buzz.
In short, if Washington is ever to have the urban density found in New York or Chicago, this is likely to be where it happens, with offices and hotels competing with luxury housing for proximity to the station.
But as the Grand Central history illustrates, it’s not just Washington that will benefit. A key assumption behind the Union Station redevelopment plan is that commuter rail service from Virginia and Maryland could double as track and station capacity increase.
The present
The area around Union Station has been growing more racially diverse and prosperous. While some new apartments, government and commercial buildings ring the station, neighborhoods of historic homes are just a few blocks away. The main obstacles to Union Station’s redevelopment ambitions are money and politics.

A changing neighborhood
In 1990, 75% of the people who lived within a mile of Union Station were black. Now, whites make up 44% of the area’s populaton, and the share of Asians and Hispanics is also growing.
Poverty and education
In 2012, 61 percent of the area’s inhabitants had a bachelor’s degree, compared with 29 percent for the rest of the United States.

* Clarification: According to the D.C. property records, the oldest commercial building in the Union Station area is the U.S. Capitol, where construction began in 1793. Property records indicate two homes on D Street SE were built in 1776. A previous version of the map key included the years built of some properties in Georgetown, which is not on the map. Union Station opened in 1907.

“Right now, you can fill a MARC train as fast as you can add it,” said Beverley Swaim-Staley, president of the USRC and a former Maryland transportation secretary.
The better-than-expected traffic on recently inaugurated weekend commuter service from the Maryland suburbs to Union Station speaks to the unmet demand, and raises the question of why Virginia hasn’t followed suit.
Indeed, there’s now serious talk of “through service,” in which Virginia trains would continue north to Fort Meade, Md., where 75,000 federal employees and contractors work, and on to Baltimore, while Maryland trains would continue over the Potomac to Crystal City, Alexandria, Springfield and Quantico. Such an expansion of service is a top priority of the region’s business community. And similar to what has happened around Metro stops, expanded service would significantly increase the value of property up and down the commuter rail lines.
Given the high cost of housing and office space in the Washington region, faster and more frequent train service could also tie Washington more closely to Baltimore and Richmond, where there are downtowns and neighborhoods with old housing stock waiting to be revitalized. It was rail service that created the New York megalopolis that stretches from Stamford, Conn., to Menlo Park, N.J., and if it achieves its potential, Union Station could do the same for Washington.
The food court at Union Station seems to cater to nearby office workers and tourists more than to passengers, who lost much of their historic space in the main hall during a renovation 25 years ago.
Passengers take back seat to retail
For all its promise, the Union Station master plan has one serious design flaw.
Twenty-five years ago, Burnham’s original station was saved from disuse and disrepair by a costly and painstaking restoration paid for largely by the federal government. Because train travel was out of fashion back then, much of the original station was turned into an indoor shopping mall.
Where there were once ticket booths and waiting halls and a broad passenger concourse, shops and restaurants were installed to help fund the renovation and provide a steady stream of income to operate and maintain the facility. Train passengers were relegated to a cramped new passenger concourse, seemingly modeled after a Greyhound bus station, that was tacked onto the rear of Burnham’s masterpiece, alongside an unsightly new parking garage.
A revival of rail travel offers the opportunity to reorient Burnham’s station back toward its original purpose, with its grand hall and ornate waiting areas geared to the comfort and convenience of passengers rather than retail shoppers and tourists.
“Our hope would be that the historic building can be an integral part of the train experience once again,” said Robert Nieweg, who heads the Union Station Preservation Coalition.
Unfortunately, the initial design unveiled last year by Amtrak and the USRC preserves the current uses of the old station, largely because of legal and financial considerations.
In 1988, when the station’s owner, USRC, went looking for a real estate firm to manage the new retail operations, interest was underwhelming. The mall-in-a-train-station concept was untested, the city’s population was declining and the neighborhood around the station was sketchy. So the USRC agreed to what turned out to be a sweetheart deal, one that offered modest rent, near-total control of the train station and the right to extend the arrangement for up to 100 years.
Initially, there were some setbacks, like the failure of a multiplex cinema beneath the main hall and disappointing sales at the higher-end restaurants. But in recent years, retail at Union Station has taken off, with sales per square foot that are some of the highest in the city. Those sales translate into rents that average about $75 a square foot, of which less than $13 per square foot is passed on to USRC.
So you can understand why Ashkenazy Acquisition Corp., the New York firm that acquired the leasehold six years ago for the hefty price of $160 million, would not be keen to give up the retail concourse without assurances that it could have a similar role, and even larger profits, from an expanded, reconfigured station. After a somewhat rocky start, officials say Ashkenazy has become an active participant in the station redevelopment process.
The potential future
A sweeping proposal would build above and below the tracks behind Union Station, creating a slice of new development between two of D.C.’s hottest markets. But the plan’s creators, Amtrak, Akridge and the Union Station Redevelopment Corp., will need to overcome political and financial hurdles to turn their concept into reality. A look at the plan’s highlights, starting from the top:
Select a level:
Note: Illustrated is a preliminary concept as of May 14.

Published Sept. 12, 2014. Link directly to this graphic
Amtrak officials also believe that, as magnificent as the old station may be, today’s passengers would rather buy a magazine, grab a sandwich and wait for their departure closer to the trains. Perhaps they are right. But then isn’t the logical solution to bring the tracks and train shed closer to the old station so that it can once again serve that purpose?
“Retail is important,” says Randall Fleischer, who heads development and marketing at the recently renovated Grand Central, “but our approach has been not to let the retail trump the passenger experience.”
Indeed, apart from a big, splashy new Apple store overlooking the main concourse, most of the retail at Grand Central is geared to train passengers. Unlike the food court at Union Station, which seems to cater to nearby office workers and tourists, Grand Central’s underground dining concourse features the famous Oyster Bar and much healthier and more attractive fast-food stalls run by local independents, not national chains. Lively bars overlook the main concourse while convenience stores and services line the underground passageways. And a new Grand Central Market just off the main concourse has stalls selling fresh fruit and vegetables, cheese, fish, meats and prepared food that people can pick up on their way to the train.
As Fleischer sees it, the best way to maximize retail revenue in a train station isn’t to attract the same stores and restaurants found in every other suburban shopping center. The trick is to create an environment that, first and foremost, encourages more people to travel by rail, and then offers enough excitement that passengers linger longer and take the next train.
Contrast that approach with what one finds at Union Station, where trains seem like an afterthought and passenger comfort and convenience take a back seat to retail sales. Walk through the front door of the main hall and the first thing you see are a couple of stalls selling T-shirts and sweatshirts. And instead of an information booth, there’s a ticket booth for a tourist trolley. You won’t hear announcements about the next train leaving for Philadelphia or arriving from Richmond — those are no longer broadcast in the old station.
Heading into the retail concourse, which stands between the main hall and the tracks, you can find several stores to sell you a new pair of shoes, but you’ll have to hunt in the far corner of the underground food court to find someone to repair your old ones. There’s a shop where you can buy all manner of fancy razors and shaving brushes, but only one barber’s chair where you can get a haircut and a shave — and nowhere for a woman to get her hair blown out and styled. There are any number of shops at which you can buy a new sports jacket or a silk blouse, but nowhere to drop one off to be dry-cleaned or repaired. The only bookstore was converted to an H&M clothing boutique a year ago. A pharmacy was never replaced.
Obviously, barbers, cobblers and dry-cleaners can’t afford to pay rents of $75 a square foot. But by improving passenger convenience, their presence could support the sales of other retailers who can.
The first step in creating “train theater” at Union Station, I would argue, is to take control of the station back from retail leasing agents and return it to train people whose primary concern is the passenger experience.
The new Union Station would go well beyond the ambitions of Daniel Burnham’s original Beaux-Arts masterpiece. It would add capacity for many more riders from the suburbs and beyond.
Tallying up the bill
Design aside, the most significant hurdle to the Union Station master plan is its price tag.
It starts with an estimated $6.5 billion for expanding and improving the station, which includes the tracks, the renovated and expanded passenger concourses, the new train shed, demolition of the old parking garage and construction of 3,500 new spaces underground.
Doubling the commuter traffic into Union Station will also require upgrading and expanding the commuter station at L’Enfant Plaza, rebuilding and doubling the track capacity on the century-old Long Bridge over the Potomac, and adding track and storage capacity in Maryland and Virginia. Figure another $1 billion for those.
In early 1907, top, Daniel Burnham's train station nears completion, launching what many look back on as a golden era of rail travel. Later decades saw the station fall into disuse. Above, a valet parking area is turned into a visitor's center in 1975.                                                                            (Top: Library of Congress; Others: Washington Post)
Above the tracks, Akridge plans to spend $1.5 billion in private funds to develop the hotels, offices, shops and residences of what it calls Burnham Place, designed by Washington architect Shalom Baranes. The city has already approved replacing the bridge over H Street — a key component of the Union Station project — at an estimated cost of nearly $200 million.
And below the tracks, Metro envisions an enlarged “superstation,” part of a new “inner loop” of stations that by 2040 would connect Union Station to the Blue, Orange and Silver lines. The existing Red Line station, already the busiest in the Metro system, also needs more capacity, as well as better connections to the street and train station. Metro has not released any cost estimates for what it wants to do at Union Station, but it’s a safe bet that these add another $1 billion to the project.
Add it all up and it comes to at least $10 billion in public and private investment. And that doesn’t include the additional billions it would cost for a new set of underground tracks and platforms for intercity high-speed rail, the fourth and final phase of the station redevelopment master plan.
So far, officials have been unable to say how they might pay for the public portion of the project, noting that they are still a year from completing engineering studies, with another two to three years required for environmental, historic preservation and other approvals. Even if construction begins as planned in 2018, the project will be built and financed in stages over a period of 25 years. And officials emphasize that any financing plan will have to make extensive use of user and passenger fees, public-private partnerships and the normal transportation funding programs of the federal and state governments.
Using Amtrak’s projections of passenger traffic, I did some back-of-the-envelope calculations to see how close I could get to $10 billion. I was able to come up with $3 billion in borrowing, public or private, that could be supported by modest fare increases for train, bus and subway passengers, parking and taxi fees, and rental income from the retail space inside the station. An additional $1 billion might be financed through a property tax surcharge on commercial property within a half-mile radius of Union Station in the District, and around commuter stations in Maryland and Virginia, all of which would become significantly more valuable. (Similar taxing districts are being used to help finance Metro’s Silver Line extension.)
Yet even with these optimistic (some would say heroic) assumptions, plus the $1.5 billion in private financing by Akridge, the federal and state governments would still have to hit up taxpayers for nearly half of the project cost — and even more if high-speed rail is to become a reality. From an economic perspective, that’s not an unreasonable sum over two decades, but politically, it’s a heavy lift — not only because of tight federal and state budgets, but also because it would require support from Maryland and Virginia for a project located outside their borders.
“There’s no question this will take substantial public funds,” acknowledged John Porcari, who as the former deputy U.S. secretary of transportation served as the federal government’s representative on the USRC’s board of directors.
Although federal and state officials are generally united in their enthusiasm and support for the Union Station master plan, several suggested that a new institutional structure might be required to pull it off, one that is regional and involves the federal government and Amtrak.
“We need to come together in terms of a regional transportation mechanism,” said Kevin Page, director of operations for the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation. “Until we get to that, there will continue to be question marks over projects like Union Station.”
It may be instructive that ever since Grand Central was rescued from the wrecking ball in the 1970s, the job of restoring and operating the station has fallen to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, a tri-state entity that runs not only the commuter trains, but also the subways, buses, bridges and tunnels that stitch together New York and its surrounding region.
Today, the MTA is in the midst of a $10 billion expansion of Grand Central so that it can accommodate about half of the commuter trains coming from Long Island at a new eight-track terminal 15 stories underground. It is the largest public capital project in the country, and when it is completed in 2019, it is expected to increase the number of train passengers through Grand Central by more than a third, to 115 million a year.
Union Station is no Grand Central, of course, but the plans for it are no less ambitious. The master plan envisions that annual passenger traffic, now about 14 million, would double in 20 years and triple in 30, reaching 42 million passengers by 2044.
“Something like this transforms Washington,” Jim Dinegar said. As president of the Greater Washington Board of Trade, Dinegar is paid to make such boosterish assessments, but this time it’s no exaggeration. Washington’s current boom economy was made possible because earlier generations were willing to make bold and expensive investments in transportation infrastructure.
Nobody thinks we’d be better off today if government had not borrowed the money to build the Beltway, or the subway system or Dulles International Airport. It would be yet another symptom of today’s cramped political vision — and our false notion of economy — if we fail to make a similarly bold investment in the expansion and redevelopment of Union Station.

D.C.s next hot neighborhoodBy Jonathan O'Connell September 12 Follow @OConnellPostBiz
On one side is NoMa, a bustling new employment center with a catchy name, home to National Public Radio, CNN and the Justice Department.
On the other side is H Street Northeast, perhaps the buzziest corridor in the city for nightlife and restaurants, and the future site of Whole Foods.
After decades of decline, development is booming on all sides of Union Station, and now the station itself could become the anchor for Washington’s next go-to spot. A D.C. developer is making a big bet on the railyard behind it, proposing to build a deck over the tracks to support a commercial and residential hub that would unite the neighborhood behind the station for the first time in 100 years.
READ: Reimagining Union Station
From its offices across the street, the Union Station Redevelopment Corp., along with Amtrak and its partners, is studying every inch of the station to prepare its pitch to the policymakers and investors needed to make the master plan a reality.
What’s there now
The area around Union Station has been growing more racially diverse and prosperous. While some new apartments, government and commercial buildings ring the station, neighborhoods of historic homes are just a few blocks away.
Year built
Residential and hotels
A changing neighborhood
In 1990, 75 percent of the people who lived within a mile of Union Station were black. Now, whites make up 44 percent of the area’s populaton, and the share of Asians and Hispanics is also growing.
Poverty and education
In 2012, 61 percent of the area’s inhabitants had a bachelor’s degree, compared with 29 percent for the rest of the United States.

More than two years after Amtrak unveiled its plan for the station, central obstacles remain: Congress cannot agree on how to spend annual transportation dollars, and the Obama administration is struggling to get rail legislation passed.
And the D.C. real estate market, for all its new apartments and restaurants, is producing little demand for office space, a primary financial driver for Burnham Place, the envisioned 3 million square-foot mixed-use mega-project.
Karen Hedlund, a top-ranking official at the Federal Railroad Administration, argues that something larger is afoot that will overwhelm cyclical budget constraints and real estate downturns — that Americans are making a generational return to cities and to rail travel as they spurn highways overwhelmed by congestion.
“By 2050 our country is going to have 100 million more people that we are going to have to move around,” she said, “and the economists believe that a majority of this population growth is going to be in cities or metropolitan areas.”
Skeptics point to the difficulty of finding the political will to enact a plan that could cost more than $10 billion. But Hedlund said that for people to move freely up and down the Northeast corridor, there is no other way.
“The alternative is double-decking Interstate 95,” she said. “There just is no more space.”
Working behind the scenes
How do you get to $10 billion?
The model may be at another Union Station, in Denver, another fast-growing city.
Though much smaller in scale and cost, the $488 million redevelopment of the Denver station offered a 22-bay bus concourse and expanded train connections when it was completed in May.
The lion’s share of the cost — $87.3 million in grants and $300.6 million in loans — came from the Transportation Department, but Hedlund said proceeds from some 2 million square feet of expected mixed-use development around the station is expected to reimburse the federal government.
“Those loans made to Denver are being paid for from proceeds of that development,” she said.
The Obama administration would like to open a much larger flow of money for such projects, by way of its proposed Grow America Act , a four-year, $302 billion transportation bill. Instead, Congress and Obama patched together an extension to the Highway Trust Fund using a budgetary gimmick.
To put together a more diverse pool of funding sources, the Union Station Redevelopment Corp. (USRC), which manages the station, is working closely with Amtrak, the Transportation Department, developer Akridge and the Federal City Council (an association of local business executives) to evaluate precisely what work is needed and how much it will cost.
In the process, USRC has collected 8,000 documents about the station, everything it could find from storage, District agencies, the Library of Congress and historians.
All the partners decide what to study and who will pay for it, and they all had a hand in working with the D.C. government to approve funding needed to shore up the H Street bridge that passes behind the station.
The partnership will need to hold together over time, as greater sums of money are needed to build each new phase of a generational project. In the meantime, Amtrak and the USRC are trying to build support by offering interim improvements to the station’s more than 100,000 daily visitors, among them a new bus terminal, freshly repaired gold leafing on the ceiling of the main hall and an updated public address system.
“People don’t have to wait until well into the future to see the start of improvements,” said Beverley Swaim-Staley, the group’s president and chief executive.
Real estate headwinds
Akridge, the D.C. real estate firm founded by John “Chip” Akridge, has committed to assembling $1.5 billion in private funds toward developing Burnham Place, the most ambitious project in the company’s 40-year history.
Since its founding, the company has had tried to acquire properties in the path of development, Akridge said, and that was the idea when he agreed to buy the development rights over the tracks, at a 2002 auction, for just $10 million.
Only three developers bid for the project. Union Station was on the decline, and the surrounding neighborhood wasn’t much better. A streetcar hadn’t even been proposed. “NoMa was a wasteland 12 years ago,” Akridge said. “H Street was even worse.”
Since then, progress “could not have been more positive,” he said. With all the new development in the area — Douglas Development has even begun rehabbing the Uline Arena, made famous by a 1964 visit from the Beatles — Akridge now expects Burnham Place to be the hole in the doughnut, one with better train access than any other site.
“We had no concept of what we see today, which is that Union Station is probably going to become the regional transportation hub in the Northeast corridor,” he said.
But the endeavor entails more uncertainty than most development projects. Akridge will have to front the capital for the deck years ahead of when it will see any return on that investment, and he isn’t sure of the price tag yet.
“You have to build the infrastructure upfront,” said Bob Murphy, managing principal at MRP Realty, a competing firm that just completed a 14-story, 400-unit apartment in NoMa. “If they are going to build that entire platform, they are going to have to have the money so that they can afford to carry it.”
Despite interest in the area, there are signs that the boom is waning. Rents at apartment buildings in neighborhoods like NoMa have begun to drop. Meanwhile, sequestration and defense spending cuts have taken a toll on the office market, which is Akridge’s bread and butter. Few companies are expanding, and those that are are leasing smaller offices, thanks to a push toward more efficient work spaces.
The vacancy rate downtown is 11.2 percent, barely down from 2009, according to the services firm Cassidy Turley. Office rents have been flat for five years.
The storm clouds are dark enough that Gerry Widdicombe, director of economic development for the Downtown Business Improvement District, thinks some office owners will have to convert their buildings to housing.
“We hear more and more from office guys that we’re going to do residential,” he said. “The office market is going sideways in a big way. No one knows really where it’s going.”
Millions of square feet of new offices are scheduled to arrive on the market before Burnham Place. Given the complexities of the master plan, Akridge will not be able to control the timing of his project as well as others.
But the first building at Burnham Place isn’t likely to be completed for at least five years, long enough for the market to roar back. And Akridge said there is already growing demand for efficient, light-filled work spaces providing less space per worker, which only newer buildings can provide.
“You can’t squeeze somebody into 125 square feet per person in a building built before 2013,” he said.
Who will lead the charge?
There are other tools available to the Union Station organizers, among them a surcharge on Amtrak tickets and a special tax on commercial properties around Union Station.
Getting any of them approved, however, would require some visible political muscle. Who is up to the task?
A new mayor could play a key role. D.C. Council member Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4), the Democratic mayoral nominee, submitted a bill late last year calling for the creation of an Office of Public Private Partnerships, aimed at raising hundreds of millions of capital dollars.
A more likely candidate may be a former mayor, Anthony A. Williams. As president of the Federal City Council, Williams holds one of five seats on the USRC board. Before he arrived, the organization played major roles in quietly pushing school reform and redeveloping libraries across the District.
Though he declined to be interviewed, Williams is widely expected to make Union Station a top priority.
He has hired Emeka Moneme, a former Metro official and director of the D.C. Department of Transportation, to oversee infrastructure projects.
Williams made a spirited speech at the unveiling of Amtrak’s master plan.
And he was talking about how best to fund public infrastructure years before Bowser’s bill; in a 2012 keynote speech at the city’s annual economic development luncheon, Williams called for a public infrastructure fund akin to the one Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D) now deploys.
Few Washingtonians enjoy the connections that Williams does to Capitol Hill, the District government and private sector executives. Swaim-Staley says anytime she needs something, Williams is there for her: “He has been a champion of the project. He has been terrific. I can’t say enough.” Hedlund echoed that sentiment: “He’s been very active.”
Jonathan O'Connell has covered land use and development in the Washington area for more than five years.

Wage revision parleys not making headway: bank unionsThe United Forum of Bank Unions is demanding, among other things, a 25 per cent hike in the pay-slip component, five-day week and proper disciplinary guidelines
Coimbatore, September 10:  
It’s been almost two years since the start of the wage revision negotiations, but no significant progress has been made in arriving at a settlement, say bank union sources.
The traditional ‘roundtable negotiations’ have been replaced by ‘correspondence’ after the last meeting on June 13, said retired bank unionist S Srinivasan.
“At the last round held in June, the Indian Banks’ Association relented to a one per cent increase to 11 per cent. Thereafter, negotiations across the table have come to a standstill and replaced with exchange of three letters between the parties, causing displeasure among bank employees,” he said.
Public sector banks, he said, are the foundation of the Indian economy. With changing times, these entities would need to rejuvenate themselves like their private sector or foreign counterparts. Healthy wage structure and service conditions would inspire and motivate the workforce, he added.
Meanwhile, MA Srinivasan, General Secretary, Canara Bank Officers’ Union, told BusinessLine that the Central Committee of the All-India Bank Officers’ Association will be meeting on September 16-17 at Kolkata to discuss wage revision, the growing problem of non-performing assets and issues concerning banking reforms.
The United Forum of Bank Unions is demanding, among other things, a 25 per cent hike in the pay-slip component, five-day week and proper disciplinary guidelines.
Justifying the hike, Srinivasan said cost of living has gone up considerably and the wage rates in other industries and even of government employees have risen significantly.
On NPAs, union sources contend that they are not the creation of the workforce.

Insurance companies plan attack as fraud territory growsInsurance companies mull staying away from nine hotbeds of fraudsters

(Almost every month, fraudsters…)
MUMBAI: Less than a fortnight ago, senior officials who have the last word on claims settled by private life insurance companies, met in Mumbai to discuss a menace they could no longer ignore.
Almost every month, fraudsters have been popping up in small towns across the country to carry out organised attacks on life companies. They come in all hues: faceless crooks in Punjab buying life covers with a bogus log-in on the Internet, as well as old-world racketeers armed with fake death certificates.
In the complex business of life insurance, the deal with the customer is simple: the family gets the cheque when the policyholder crosses over to the other side; indeed, to most, few things in life can be more black and white. But there can be 50 shades of grey when a death is less than honest — a truth that many private insurers are discovering every other day.
Insurers are stumbling on strange cases where the police, panchayat sachiv, lawyers and family members are hand-inglove to push claims where the policyholder is still alive, where a person is made to sign a policy on her death bed, and even where a policyholder is simply a fictitious character. While for ages insurance crimes have been a fodder for movies and thriller stories, what has surprised insurance companies this time around is the organised nature of the frauds and their rising number: cases of fraud have risen to 2-4 per cent of total rejected claims from well below 1 per cent a few years ago.
At the meeting in Mumbai attended by more than 15 private life firms (including the leading players), the officials identified the hotbeds for fraudsters
The hotbeds for fraudsters are: Sabarkantha, Modasa, Kheda and Mehsana in Gujarat; Jalgaon, Dhule and Nandurbar in Maharashtra; Ganjam in Odisha, and Morena in Madhya Pradesh.
Also under watch are places like Khammam (Andhra Pradesh), Kubernagar, Sunder Nagar and Bhavnagar (in Gujarat), and parts of Punjab where, though instances of frauds have been reported, the situation is not yet alarming.
The unofficial decision among life insurers is to stay away from selling policies in these regions — particularly on the Net and covers with high sum assured, said a person who was present at the meeting. The insurers will soon present a note on the situation for the Life Insurance Council to take up the matter with the Insurance Regulatory & Development Authority.
"There are some regions where frauds are happening in an organised manner," said Sunil Sharma , chief actuary, Kotak Life Insurance.
"There are cases where the level of income does not justify level of insurance. There are frauds in some areas of Haryana, Gujarat and places such as Muzaffarnagar in UP. There is a need for better coordination among companies to curb the menace."
According to the claims head of a mid-sized firm, fraudulent employees of a few insurance aggregators are also involved in false claims against policies bought on the Net. "It's easier on the Net as you do not see the person. They pay a few premiums and then make the claim...Often, a person whose personal details are misused may not be aware of the goings-on. There are cases where the so-called policyholder died before the cover was purchased. All documents can be faked...Even the Ombudsman , who has to go by hard evidence, has ruled in favour of fraudsters," said the person who refused to be named.
"There are ambulance chasers who tie up with family members to buy a policy for someone who is in a critical stage. They make sure that hospitalization and medical records are destroyed so that insurance companies find it difficult to refuse the claim on grounds of 'medical non-disclosure'...And, there are always those cases where a person buys covers from multiple companies, but these can curbed if insurers crosscheck with each other."
According to the industry official, tricksters also exploit the loophole in law by claiming the money after two years — a tactic that weakens the case for insurance companies. In a business where competition is fierce and targets and deadlines are punishing, swindlers take advantage of the incentive-driven salesman's rush to get business.
Agents who bring these businesses should be blacklisted and underwriting norms should be more stringent, said an executive with a private company. Insurers collect documents such as bank statements and tax returns, and policies above Rs 50,000 need PAN card number, but expert forgers make sure that companies do not suspect too much.
"Frauds started with term plans and have now moved to savings plans, such as money-back policies," said an agent. Still, these are early days. "We are hearing that claims in certain areas have gone up," said V Manikham, secretarygeneral, Life Insurance Council — the representative body of all life insurance companies in India.
"We do not have data to substantiate it," he said.In 2012-13, insurance companies had settled 8.46 lakh claims on individual policies with a total payout of Rs 9,370.22 crore. Around 18,485 claims amounting to Rs 568.42 crore were repudiated while 12,267 claims worth Rs 318.24 crore were pending at the year-end.

PM Narendra Modi’s rise from Vadnagar to 7, Race Course Road, spawns a huge publishing opportunity

Accidental Prime Minister
(Bookshop at BJP office in…)
NEW DELHI: Three weeks ago in Mumbai, Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani released a picture book on Prime Minister Narendra Modi containing what were said to be rare pictures of the man, chronicling his journey from Vadnagar, a small village in Gujarat, to 7 Race Course in New Delhi.
Around the same time in New Delhi, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley released a coffee table book on the prime minister titled, Being Modi. "Did you know that Modi was hiding in a basement of a house during the Emergency, suffering from jaundice? Or that his family still remembers the excellent sabudana khichdi he makes," co-author Nikita Parmar says.
The 25-year-old Delhi High Court lawyer travelled extensively throughout Gujarat last year to get to grips with Modi's personal story. "I have interviews of his old friends, close family members. People are bored of reading about his political life now, that is why I chose to find out more about his family and personal habits," she adds.
Modi's rise has spawned a huge publishing industry, with more than 80 books being released on him in different languages in the past few months alone. Most of them are in Hindi and Gujarati, and are usually released by a dignitary.
These are written by former journalists, lawyers, RSS workers and one by his bodyguard. Priced between Rs 45 and Rs 500, there are books of all kinds on the PM — comics, picture books and political biographies among others.
These include Durdrashta Narendra Modi, Ghar Ghar Modi, Bhavishya Ki Asha--Narendra Modi, Narendra Modi Ka Rajnitik Safar, Narendra Modi --Sangarsh Se Shikar Tak, Swarnim Gujarat Na Modi, Mahanayak Narendra Modi and Prernamurthy Narendra Modi. The titles in English are varied: Narendra Modi, Yes he Can, Modi -- Man of Developing India, Modi Demystified, Modi: Change We Can Believe In, This is Narendra Modi, Modimantra among others. Modi's biographies have also been translated into Chinese and French, and those written by the PM himself - Samajik Samarasta, Sakshibhaan, Aapatkal Mein Gujarat - are prominently displayed in bookstores.
Navbharat Sahitya Mandir, one of the largest Gujarati publishing houses in the country, has issued a series of books on Modi. It's now looking at "unheard stories of the PM" to tell people, said proprietor Ronak Shah .
Shah refers to Gujarati writer and translator Aditya Vasu, who has authored books such as Narendra Modi ki Jeevan Katha and Namovaani. Vasu, 78, used to be a trader of antique items in Gujarat until about 10 years ago, then started writing about Modi after the 2002 religious riots. His books have gone into a fourth reprint after a spurt in interest in them, Shah said.
"I thought he was being wronged," said Vasu. "That is why I chose to write about what Modi did during the Godhra accident and how much he supported the special investigation team that looked into the matter," said the writer, who is also busy with Gujarati translations of the Chicken Soup series.
The election results have given a fresh lease of life to Common Man Narendra Modi, said author Kishore Makwana , who first met Modi in 1983 at an RSS shakha near Ahmedabad. An RSS member and author, Makwana said he chose to write on Modi because he had seen the man from close quarters and wanted the world to know the simple, unknown aspects of the man. "Not many people know his love for Bengali music. He is so fluent in Marathi that he translates his Gujarati books into the language himself."
Makwana said what interested publishers was an old interview of Modi where he talks about his interests, especially his love for photography. "After he came back from a Kailash Mansorovar Yatra in 1989, there was an exhibition of his photos in Ahmedabad." Former bodyguard Prabir Mahanti's Modi aur Mein looks at his working style and his attitude towards others. Mahanti was an assistant commandant in the National Security Guard and part of Modi's security detail in 2006 and 2007.
Not all the books are doing too well though. The bookshop at the BJP office on Ashoka Road in Delhi has 180 books on Modi in different languages but the biggest seller is LK Advani's My Country, My Life.
"The Accidental Prime Minister (on Manmohan Singh by Sanjaya Baru) has done better than all these new Modi releases put together," said Anup Kumar of Faqir Chand and Sons , a Delhi-based bookseller and distributor. "We had to send back many of the copies as there was no demand." According to him, only three books on Modi - Narendra Modi: The Man, The Times by Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, The Namo Story, A Political Life by Kingshuk Nag and Narendra Modi: A Political Biography by Andy Marino - have sold well.
RTI activist Vivek Garg , who has written two books on Modi, said copies of his works were even shipped to Islamabad as there was demand for them. "The books may not be selling like hot cakes but they are still moving. Given that Modiji is dynamic figure who will remain a topic of interest for many years now, we need books that explain how he will change India."

Fusion foods make a mark as dessert play a k...Fusion foods make a mark as dessert play key role in restaurant menu

As per National Restaurant Association of India, Indian food services industry has seen a steady growth in past few years & will grow in next 5 years.

NEW DELHI: Ever imagined pairing Rooh Afza with creme brulee? Or gooey marshmallows oozing out of an olden-day classic, chinni ki roti, or even a gaajar ka halwa with goat cheese? Gone are the days of fruit salad with ice cream — as India's restaurant culture evolves, chefs are getting creative with dessert, and with good reason.
It accounts for a good quarter of revenue at some outlets. The traditional is being informed by the modern. Here's a tasting menu of sweet things — molecular phirni-oxide, a Parle-G cheesecake, jalebi cavier, rasmalai tres leches and apple cinnamon jalebis.
Such concoctions garnished with a hint of molecular gastronomy are being eagerly ordered in restaurants across the country. Chefs are taking fusion food up a notch by experimenting with Indian desserts as the business expands.
According to the National Restaurant Association of India , the Indian food services industry has seen a steady growth in the past few years and is expected to grow at over 11 per cent in the next five years.
Right now the size of the industry is approximately Rs 2.5 trillion and is projected to reachRs 4.1 trillion by 2018. And one of the key factors propelling restaurant growth will be experimentation with new formats, themes and menus by innovative, entrepreneurial ventures, according to the association.
As the average food bill rises, dessert is playing a key role. Riyaaz Amlani's new restaurant Social Offline serves a fried chocolate bar, Ramesh Suresh. Manish Mehrortra's much-feted Indian Accent in Delhi is dishing out traditional desserts in a modern avatar—Gujarati suterfeni, rose chikki, home-made pistachio ice cream or the raw and ripe mango daulat ki chaat with mango candy brittle are all runaway successes.Rahul Akerkar, founder of Degustibus Hospitality, which owns the Indigo chain of restaurants, said close to 25 per cent of revenue comes from desserts. That follows since prices have gone up with the makeover and, more importantly, customers are happy to pay. Gulab jamuns can cost up to Rs 600 for a portion at some restaurants.
"Yes there is certainly a demand in the market for innovative food and these desserts fall in this category," said Akerkar. The chef created halwa creme brulee with goat cheese at Indigo and a mille-feuille with shrikhand and berries. But he emphasises that chefs should be careful they don't make a "khichdi" out of dessert. It's an interesting time to be an Indian patron, according to owners.
"There was a time when desserts were relegated to the last page of a menu," said restaurateur Zorawar Kalra , founder of Massive Restaurants. But "the kind of modern Indian desserts we are doing tend to leave a final memory for people to return to us."He's working on the concept of a mithai takeaway that should debut before the end of the year. "It's about time the Indian dessert arrives, and there is limitless potential in this concept," he said, particularly since only one in three people have dessert, according to restaurateurs.
Delhi-based Mehrotra of Indian Accent looks to British culinary alchemist Heston Blumenthal for inspiration. He's reinventing simple classics such as chini ki roti (literally sugar bread) with marshmallows besides doing a besan laddoo tart served with a side of 'mithai' cheesecake."Indian cuisine will boom again and it's time it comes out of the closet. We need a little modern twist with our traditional foods," said Mehrotra. Prices are reasonable at Delhi's Cafe Lota— apple cinnamon jalebi with coconut rabri and bhapa doi cheesecake comes for Rs 125 a plate.
Pastry chef Kishi Arora, who owns baking company Foodaholics, said spending power and experimentation have risen significantly and customers want to try fun Indian things that have been created by playing around with international techniques.
"Recently, a customer asked me to bake a New York style cheesecake with red chilli powder and chunda (raw mango chutney). So, I made little cupcakes out of them and the Gujarati clients were floored," said Arora. Her cakes are priced upward of Rs 3,000 per kilo and that includes crossover desserts.

Chhattisgarh: Polling begins for bypoll in insurgency-hitAntagarhPrint
Press Trust of India | Raipur | Posted: September 13, 2014 9:16 am | Updated: September 13, 2014 3:37 pm
About 40 per cent electorate on Saturday cast their franchise till 1 PM in insurgency-hit Antagarh assembly seat of Chhattisgarh, where a gun-battle took place between ultras and security personnel in Amabeda forests.
Voting for Antagarh bypoll began from 7 AM and around 40 per cent turnout was recorded till 1 PM, Joint Chief Electoral
Officer DD Singh informed.
As many as 202 polling stations, including 190 hyper sensitive and three auxiliary booths, have been set up for the
bypoll where as many as 1,51, 894 electorates will exercise their franchise till 3 PM, Singh said.
Around 10,000 security personnel have been deployed in the region to ensure fair and peaceful polling, he added.
Meanwhile, an encounter took place in Edenga village forests under Amabeda police station limits after naxal triggered an IED blast to harm a squad of STF (special task force) conducting a cordon in the region.
When security personnel reached the forests, rebels triggered a blast and opened fire.
However, when jawans retaliated, they fled into core forests, Kanker Superintendent of Police RN Dash said.
No injuries or causalities were reported in the incident, Dash added.
For Antagarh bypoll, 14 candidates had filed their nominations and after scrutiny and withdrawal, only two of them– Bhojraj Naag from BJP and Rupdhar Pudo of Ambedkarite Party of India– were left in the fray.
The bypoll was necessitated after BJP legislator Vikram Usendi resigned following his election to the Lok Sabha from
Kanker seat.
After declaration of the bypoll schedule, the Congress, which had been struggling after a humiliating defeat in both
Assembly as well as Lok Sabha elections in the state, had declared Manturam Pawar as its candidate from the seat, anticipating a good show.
However, Pawar surprisingly pulled out from the contest a day before the last day of withdrawal of nominations on August
29 for the bypoll, after which he was expelled from Congress.

EC order against former Maharashtra CM set asidePrint
Written by Aneesha Mathur , with input from  pti 5    | New Delhi | Posted: September 13, 2014 12:30 am
The Delhi High Court Friday set aside the show-cause notice issued by the Election Commission (EC) against former Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan for allegedly failing to submit a proper account of expenses for the Assembly elections in 2009.
The court of Justice Suresh Kait in its 101-page order also analysed the provisions of law relating to election offences and said the EC did not conduct the inquiry properly as it did not take note of the evidence regarding whether Chavan could be legally held to have “authorised” the advertisements issued by party workers.
“This court is of the considered opinion that the Commission has failed on both counts, that is, by not complying with the Rule-89(6) of the Rules and not framing the issue regarding knowledge and consent of the petitioner or his agent on the expenses incurred on advertisements in question. Moreover, no evidence was brought on record before writing its opinion against the petitioner. Therefore, I set aside the impugned order dated 13.07.2014 and consequential order to issue show-cause notice under Rule-89(5) of the Rules,” said Kait.
During the Maharashtra Assembly elections in October 2009, a series of advertisements regarding public meetings to be held by UPA leaders and campaigners were taken out in various local publications. According to the notice issued by the EC, Chavan had failed to account for expenses of over Rs 16,000 spent on some of these advertisements, thereby violating the provisions of the law.
The High Court, however, accepted Chavan’s argument that the expenses had been made without his knowledge by local Congress leaders and the same could not be held to have been “authorised” by him.
Earlier, former law minister and senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who also represented Chavan, had contended that his client had filed all correct poll expenses and had incurred an expenditure of Rs 6.85 lakh in the 2009 Assembly elections. Chavan had won the 2009 Assembly polls from Bhokar in Maharashtra’s Nanded Lok Sabha constituency. He won the recent Lok Sabha polls from Nanded.
Earlier, the Supreme Court had asked the high court to decide Chavan’s plea within 15 days while refusing to interfere with its July 28 decision staying the show-cause notice issued to Chavan on July 13. The apex court had said it was not in favour of the matter dragging and that the High Court should decide the question of law.

Amid tight security arrangements, polling began on Saturday for the bypolls to the four assembly constituencies in Rajasthan. Twenthy-three candidates including four each from the ruling BJP and opposition Congress are in the fray in Nasirabad (Ajmer), Weir (Bharatpur), Surajgarh (Jhunjhunu) and Kota South constituencies where 950 polling stations have been set up.
“The polling began in all the constituencies at 7 am,” an election department official said. Elaborate security arrangements have been made to ensure free and fair polling. Paramilitary forces, companies of Rajasthan Armed Constabulary and 6,000 policemen have been deployed in all the four constituencies, according to Special DGP (Law and Order) Navdeep Singh.

China urges central Asian neighbours to fight extremism and cyberterrorismChina, Russia and four Central Asian nations - Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan - formed the SCO in 2001 (Source: AP)
Reuters | Beijing | Posted: September 13, 2014 9:26 am | Updated: September 13, 2014 12:47 pm
China’s President Xi Jinping urged Central Asian states to step up the fight against religious extremism and cyber terrorism, state media said, as Beijing reaches for help across its borders in addressing security concerns in its restive Xinjiang region.
Beijing says separatist groups in the far western region of Xinjiang, home to the Muslim Uighur minority, are seeking to form their own state called East Turkestan and have links with militants in Central Asia as well as Pakistan.
The government says such separatists are influenced by militant groups’ training videos and audio from beyond its borders, though experts dispute their influence and reach.
“(We) should make concerted efforts to crack down on the ‘three evil forces’ of terrorism, extremism and separatism,” the official Xinhua news agency said late on Friday, citing Xi’s speech in Tajikistan to the heads of state of other Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) members.
“Currently, (we) should focus on combating religion-involved extremism and Internet terrorism,” Xi said, adding that the group’s Regional Counter-Terrorism Structure (RCTS) should enhance efforts to combat drug trafficking.
China, Russia and four Central Asian nations – Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan – formed the SCO in 2001 as a regional security bloc to fight threats posed by radical Islam and drug trafficking from neighbouring Afghanistan.
Many experts and rights groups say economic marginalisation of Uighurs is one of the main causes of ethnic violence that has killed hundreds of people across China in the past year and a half.
They argue that benefits of development in Xinjiang, resource-rich and strategically located on the borders of ex-Soviet central Asia, largely have gone to majority Han Chinese, stoking resentment among Uighurs.
China’s leaders have vowed to strike hard at religious militants and separatist groups.
On Friday, a Chinese court sentenced three people to death and one to life in prison for an attack at a Yunnan province train station in March in which 31 people were killed and 141 injured.
Currently, (we) should focus on combating religion-involved extremism and Internet terrorism.

Four years after parting with Hero  India becomes Hondas largest two-wheelermarketHonda Motorcycle & Scooter India currently has a 4.5 million unit annual capacity across three plants in Haryana, Rajasthan and Karnataka. (Reuters)
New Delhi | Posted: September 13, 2014 10:23 am
India is now Honda’s largest two-wheeler market in the world, crossing Indonesia and Vietnam in the past two months, Keita Muramatsu, President & CEO of Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India (HMSI) said.
“We have been growing very fast and right now demand is higher than we can produce. Within a few years we have moved from the fourth position in India’s two wheeler industry to the second. This year we will have a launch every quarter,” Muramatsu said, adding that a 160cc bike will be introduced in October-December this year to challenge Bajaj’s Pulsar and TVS Apache.
HMSI currently has a 4.5 million unit annual capacity across three plants in Haryana, Rajasthan and Karnataka. A fourth plant in Gujarat is scheduled to start production in 2017 adding a further 1.2 million unit capacity. Study for a fifth plant will also start this year.
YS Guleria, VP for sales & marketing said, “We have expanded our range in the mass 100-110 cc bike segment with the Dream range and while the segment’s share in total two wheeler sales have fallen from 49% in 2012 to 47%, our sales have grown. But the rural market is challenging and we are working hard.”

Why India s Love Affair With Gold May be OverGail Makes Gas Available From Alternate Sources to Gujarat Industries
Kiran Laxman Salunkhe used to buy jewellery during religious festivals, but sliding gold prices have led the young farmer to break with his family's traditional investment.
This year Salunkhe has deposited his hard-earned savings at the bank for the first time in a decade and bought farmland.
"I bought jewellery when gold price was Rs 32,000 (per 10 grams) last year. Now jewellers won't pay me more than Rs 27,000 if I want to sell. Why should I invest in gold," said Mr Salunkhe, who farms 15 acres of sugar cane in Vangal, a village 250 km (160 miles) south of Mumbai.
"Nowadays it is risky to keep jewellery. Burglaries are rising," he said. "With a fixed deposit there is no risk."
A one-quarter drop in local gold prices over the past year has shaken the confidence of Indians in the precious metal as a store of value and dented demand in the world's second-biggest buyer.
(Also read: Gold Stuck Near 7-1/2 Month Low; Set for Worst Week Since May )
The main beneficiary has been stocks, which have been clocking up records on hopes that Prime Minister Narendra Modi can deliver on the promise of "better days" ahead that swept him to power in May's general election.
Beyond short-term sentiment, a major push by PM Modi for every household to get a bank account, better education and living standards, and falling inflation expectations, could herald a more secular change in investing habits.
"The attachment of Indians to gold will remain," said Harish Galipelli, head of commodities and currencies at Inditrade Derivatives and Commodities Ltd., referring to gold's culturally embedded role in dowry gifts or decorating Hindu temples.
"But as the banking network expands and literacy rises, people in rural areas will explore other investment products like mutual funds or bank deposits. The mindset is slowly changing."
If the national obsession with gold does fade that would help curb India's external deficits - gold is the second biggest item on the import bill after oil - and cap world gold prices that are trading sideways in 2014.
BACK TO EQUITIES
If the crowds selling scrap gold to Kapil Parekh at his shop in Mumbai's Zaveri Bazaar are anything to go by, the shift by small-time speculators out of gold is continuing unabated.
"Many investors who came after 2008's stock market crash were short-term investors," said Mr Parekh.
"They came when the stock market wasn't giving returns. Now, since shares are rallying, they are liquidating gold and going back to equities. They may come back."
One customer, Dinesh Jain, said he had sold 64 grams of gold bought since 2011 and was investing the proceeds - now worth nearly $3,000 (Rs 1.80 lakh at 60 rupee per dollar) - in information technology stocks.
India's investment demand for gold slumped by 67 per cent in the June quarter from a year ago to 49.6 tonnes, World Gold Council (WGC) data showed. Based on industry and WGC estimates, investment demand could nearly halve to 190 tonnes this year.
Investment demand was 37 per cent of total 2013 gold sales.
Indian gold exchange-traded funds, a financial product that sophisticated investors use to gain exposure to the metal, have suffered 15 straight months of outflows.
In contrast, turnover on Mumbai's main NSE bourse is up by 61 per cent, while $50 billion has flowed into mutual funds in the financial year starting April 1 - up sixfold from the entire previous year.
Term deposits in banks have also risen but by a more modest $3.6 billion since April, compared to a drop of $2.9 billion last year, central bank figures show.
SHIFTING SENTIMENT
A decade-long surge in gold prices to 2013 led investment buying of bars and coins to quadruple. Over the same time, sales of traditionally more popular jewellery rose by just a quarter.
But since hitting a record high of Rs 35,074 per 10 grams in August 2013, local gold prices have fallen steadily, tracking weakness in overseas prices and a strengthening rupee.
In the past, such price falls would have attracted bargain hunters. Not now.
"The 11-year rally in gold prices created a perception that they will only go up. This price fall has broken that conviction," Prithviraj Kothari, vice president of the India Bullion & Jewellers' Association, told Reuters.
"Now people are diversifying their investments. This trend will increase in the coming years," added Mr Kothari, cautioning that expectations of a tightening in super-loose U.S. monetary policy would weigh on gold.
"During uncertainly people chase gold. Now, since we have stability, economic growth will revive. It will ultimately push up the stock market and real estate prices."
But for some India's love affair with gold will endure.
"Last year, despite a premium of over $100 (per ounce over London prices), buyers were crowding my counter," said a Mumbai-based dealer at a state-run bank.
"Now, the premium is just $5. The peak festive season is ahead. But I am waiting for customers. There is no hysteria."

Android One to help Facebook s growth in IndiaGoogle's Android One smartphones to help bolster Facebook's growth in India
By Shelley Singh , ET Bureau | 12 Sep, 2014, 07.01AM IST
Facebook will benefit as much as Google as new smartphone users will also log into the former's popular social networking and messenger applications.

ET Special: All you want to know about Apple iPhone 6
NEW DELHI: Even as Google prepares to pry open larger chunks of the Indian market with an array of cheap smartphones as part of its Android One programme, it will also willy-nilly help rival Facebook grow its India numbers.
Next Monday, Google is widely expected to launch a range of Android One smartphones, mostly priced under Rs 6,000 ($100). These have been developed in partnership with local mobile phone manufacturers including Micromax , Karbonn and Spice . They are expected to be loaded with topend features such as dual core chip, 5 MP camera and 4.5-inch display.
But, as these cheap and powerful smartphones flood the market, Facebook will benefit as much as Google as new smartphone users will also log into the former's popular social networking and messenger applications.
Facebook has 108 million users in India active monthly, of which 94 million access it on a mobile.
"A low-cost smartphone which allows a good user experience will accelerate adoption of Facebook," says Jessie Paul, CEO, Paul Writer Strategic Advisory, a marketing consultancy. "In fact, it could take Facebook's access on mobile devices to 100 per cent from about 93 per cent at present."
"We
are now looking forward to one billion users in India. That is a different focus and challenge," Javier Olivan, vice-president, growth & analytics, Facebook, had told ET in a March interview. Google's Android One will make the challenge easier.
Google, Facebook and much of the Internet companies ecosystem are often referred to as 'frenemies'. They are friends in the sense that the success of any one company invariably yields spin-off benefits for others; enemies because all of them compete for the same users and online advertising dollars.
Google's Android One program will not only benefit Facebook, but the entire gamut of social networking companies including Twitter, Instagram etc, all of which will gain more smartphone users. But Facebook could gain more than others, since it has the largest user base in India. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has crafted a mobile first strategy for Facebook and has publicly admitted the company's biggest mistake was "we burned two years not working on mobile."
"Every service will benefit, be it Facebook, Whatsapp or Skype ," says Katyayan Gupta, analyst, eBusiness & Channel strategy, Forrester Research. Google and Facebook declined to comment on this story.
Android One is tipped to be a game changer in the smartphone market, delivering a better experience to users.
"Low-cost Android smartphones have poor touch screen, poor camera and poor memory. This impacts user experience be it Facebook or Google docs," says Forrester's Gupta.
"But Android One will provide a consistent user experience across all devices," he adds. Adds Mohammad Chowdhury, leader, telecom, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC): "Android One will shake up the low-end to midtier smartphone market," Google finished the second quarter with $14.3 billion in advertising revenues compared to Facebook's $2.68 billion.

AHMEDABAD: An Ahmedabad-based company, promoted by two sisters, has introduced Halal range of cosmetics that adheres to Islamic processes.
Mauli Teli , a former life sciences consultant with PWC and her younger sister Girishma Teli, a biotechnologist, returned from the US to invest Rs 5 crore in the Halal-certified unit. Their two year old start-up, Ecotrail Personal Care , on Wednesday introduced 60 products under the brand iba Halal Care eyeing a clientele among Indian Muslims, who form the world's second-largest Muslim population, and vegans.
"We are creating a new category. Halal means lawful or permitted. The concept ensures that all products are free from impurities, ethical, safe and effective", says Mauli Teli, CEO & Managing Partner, Ecotrail Personal Care.
Most cosmetics, deodorants, and perfumes use alcohol or pig fat as ingredients. A Halal product would thus be acceptable even for the Jain community, says Teli whoherself belongs to the community that abstains from non-vegetarian products and alcohol.
Muhamed Meeran, COO of Halal India, a Chennai-based Halal-certification company, says Halal category is $4-trillion-strong globally and cosmetics account for $26-billion. The company that certifies Indian products for exports, mostly to the Middle East, says Ecotrail is the first company to get Halal certification for cosmetics.
Tata Salt, Fortune Oil, Vadilal Ice-cream, Gokul Oil are other known brands among 5500 products from 500 companies that have taken Halal certification for exports.
Nadeem Jafri of Ahmedabad-based HeartyMart says like yoga, Halal too is a concept for healthy living and would gain acceptance.
Chandan Nath, a strategic branding consultant for entrepreneurs, says Halal products can address the needs of vegetarian communities like Brahamins and Jains.
Ecotrail would start with two company owned stores in Ahmedabad and within a year, it plans to open 15-20 stores including an online store.

Hindustan Unilever Limited launches e-tail pilot projectET Special: All you want to know about Apple iPhone 6
MUMBAI: It is not unusual for consumer products giant Hindustan Unilever (HUL) to move out of its comfort zone and experiment with ideas which do not fall in its main line of business. In the past, the FMCG major had experimented with a launderette, and now it is said to be conducting a few pilots in the growing e-commerce space.
According to industry sources, the Rs 28,000-crore HUL is considering using its strength of being present in 3.2 million outlets across the country to ensure consumers are delivered products directly at their doorsteps. The neighbourhood kirana shop owner would most likely play a key role here. It is also learnt that in addition to selling its own products through the e-commerce route, HUL could consider selling certain non-competing products as well through this route. To begin with, the initiative is taking place at a very initial stage of a few stores. However, a scale-up in the future is not entirely ruled out, said sources.
"HUL recognizes e-commerce as an important platform to reach out to consumers and shoppers. From time to time, we pilot various initiatives and learn from them. We regret that we have no specific comments to offer on your queries below," said an HUL company spokesperson in response to a query on the company's entry into e-commerce.
A decade back, HUL had launched a launderette in a bid to gain some consumer insights in laundry. It had also set up a consumer-delivery model under Sangam Direct, which it eventually exited. HUL also runs a few Bru Cafes in Mumbai which, once again, helps the company in connecting the brand with the consumer. The company continues to be present in the direct selling industry with brands like Aviance and Lever Ayush.
All these models go beyond the company's core business of marketing FMCG products, but these have been undertaken to understand the changing consumer buying behaviour. With e-commerce becoming a growing platform where consumers purchase goods, a few pilot projects that HUL has undertaken would help the marketer to better understand the manner in which the new medium functions.
According to industry reports, e-tailing has the potential of reaching $20-30 billion in five to six years. The sector rides on the growing internet user base, which is slated to cross around 400 million users by 2020. Convenience and free home delivery appears to be driving the trend of consumers shopping online.
An industry expert said e-commerce was fuelling convergence between manufacturer, retailer and consumer. For a company like HUL, which has over 40 brands spanning 20 categories, it is important to understand the consumer buying behaviour online, which is very different from traditional retail.
HUL recently expanded its direct retail reach in its endeavour to serve consumers in the farthest corners of India. The maker of Dove soaps, Surf detergent, Kissan ketchup and Lipton tea also extended its 'perfect stores' programme to one million stores by the end of 2013.

HRD ministry to launch e-edu courses from IIT & IIMHDR ministry
(Central universities,…)
NEW DELHI: The ministry of human resource development will roll out a host of digital initiatives including free online courses from top institutions, a national e-library for students and a dedicated portal to help students make informed choices about higher education, HRD minister Smriti Irani said on Thursday.
Central universities, Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) will soon start offering massive open online courses (MOOCs), or courses offered on the internet with unlimited participation, free of cost, Irani said in her first press conference after joining office.
The e-library, which will be launched next year, will allow students to access content from premier educational institutions.
The online portal, 'Know Your College', will be a repository of information related to all universities and colleges and will allow students to have their grievances redressed in case they have been misled by an institute or college.
The HRD minister also announced that a national and state-level deliberation on the new education policy will begin in January next year. She did not comment on whether the new policy would incorporate the four-year format for undergraduate courses, but said, "During the national, state and regional level debates we will discuss how the courses should be structured." Irani also said Prime Minister Narendra Modi's interaction with children on the Teacher's Day on September 5 was viewed by almost 9.5 crore students across 8.5 lakh schools in the country.
The HRD minister evaded questions on whether a similar exercise be held on the Children's Day on November 14, the birthday of the country's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru. "You will have to wait for it till the time comes," Irani said.

TCS  SMU extend tie-up for intelligent city researchiCity Lab
(SMU and TCS have agreed…)
NEW DELHI: India's largest software services firm Tata Consultancy Services today said it has extended by three years its partnership with Singapore Management University for research on 'intelligent city'.
The SMU-TCS iCity Lab, a Singapore Management University (SMU) and TCS joint venture, is focused on R&D of intelligent city solutions.
SMU and TCS have agreed to continue the partnership for another three years to undertake a number of research initiatives and projects, TCS said in a statement.
These will include developing technology solutions specifically tailored to the needs of senior citizens in Singapore under a research grant secured from the Government of Singapore last week for the SHINESeniors Project, it added.
The iCity Lab was established in August 2011 within the SMU School of Information Systems as a three-year research collaboration, whereby SMU and TCS would work together on research related to intelligent cities.
TCS said the Lab, over the last three years, has done several projects across the intelligent city domain, including a deep focus on ageing and chronic disease management, as well as personalised community healthcare services, TCS said.
"This research will lead to the development of an end-to-end personalised care delivery platform from sense making to emergency response services," TCS President Asia Pacific Vish Iyer said.
Under the SHINESeniors (Smart Homes and Intelligent Neighbours to Enable Seniors) project, sensor-enabled homes will be developed in support of ageing-in-place for senior citizens living in Singapore.
SMU-TCS iCity Lab will work with multiple stakeholders, including several government agencies and community partners, to implement the project over three years.
Singapore faces major challenges in providing care and support for senior citizens due to the fact that the number of post-retirement people aged 65 and older is increasing faster than that of the working population age of 20 to 64, SMU Dean of School of Information Systems and Vice Provost (Research) Steven Miller said.
"This is the core challenge we are now concentrating on at the iCity Lab. We conceptualised and designed the SHINESeniors Project to help Singapore tackle some of the challenges relating to this situation," he added.
The iCity Lab will work with SMU's Living Analytics Research Centre (LARC) for data analytics support. In addition, SMU's School of Social Sciences will also contribute to the SHINESeniors project.

Govt needs to strengthen its internet governance positionModi government's approach to internet governance position and regime must be strengthened

(To realise Indian Talent…)
By Subimal Bhattacharjee
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has signalled the policy direction and future roadmap in many sectors. It has announced a comprehensive Digital India initiative that would cater to digital infrastructure capacity building, governance and services on demand and digital empowerment of citizens. What remains untouched is the approach to internet governance position and regime.
The realisation of Digital India will happen through the media of internet and its availability and, hence, have a significant impact on the direction that the global internet governance deliberations take. To realise Indian Talent (IT) + Information Technology (IT) = India Tomorrow (IT), India has to be fully engaged, if not leading the global deliberations on internet.
The ninth meeting of the Internet Governance Forum was held at Istanbul last week. Despite expectations, the new government did not spell out its position to the global community.
Hopefully, this would be done at the ITU Plenipotentiary meet in October at Seoul. Since the UN General Assembly session in October 2011 — when the then-Opposition BJP MP Dushyant Singh had proposed the 50-nation Committee on Internet Related Proposals to govern all issues around internet backed by the India, Brazil, South Africa (Ibsa) deliberations just before that — India is seen to be drifting away from what is perceived to be the club of nations as the natural way forward for running the medium.
The Indian position was clear about a democratic, transparent and inclusive arrangement running the medium. But it was seen as somewhat complex and impossible to administer considering the range of stakeholders.
Now, there is a divide among nations : multi-stakeholder versus multilateralism. The OECD countries, with more than 80 per cent of the internet economy, back the multistakeholder approach. Countries such as China, Russia, Iran and few others, with doubtful internet freedom credentials, favour multilateralism.
In March this year, when the US agreed to give up the management of the key IANA functions to a wider body on six conditions, the key point was a multi-stakeholder regime. At NetMundial in Brazil in April this year, following the US announcement, India reiterated its commitment to a democratic and transparent medium, but ambiguously proposed a multilateral regime with all stakeholders involved. With a Global Commission on Internet Governance (GCIG) as a representative multi-stakeholder body working now under the leadership of the Swedish foreign minister, it will be critical for India to present its position in a clear, comprehensive way.
Since internet fragmentation is already being talked about, it would be crucial to understand how an Indian role could avert it. Possibly, Modi can play the role of a global statesman to ensure internet remains one, free for all to use but under certain accepted norms. It would be a fitting approach from a leader who understands the power of netizens.
At the Brics summit in Brazil in July this year, Modi flagged cyber issues as being a global commons and the need for Brics to look at this medium and its efficient management. It will be interesting to see what a Brics involvement in internet governance issues may bring, given a divide even within this grouping on multi-stakeholder versus multilateralism.
What lies in India's interest? As a significant and respected player in the global information technology ecosystem, India's position will be keenly watched. So, a comprehensive think-tank exercise should be undertaken on the economic and security interests of the nation.
Clearly, the call has to be on merit. Today, the OECD accounts for over 90 per centof India's software and service industry exports of more than $100 billion. So, the impact potential business' growth on the Indian economy should be factored in. Likewise, cyber security and stability of the medium are also crucial factors to consider.

ET Special: All you want to know about Apple iPhone 6
NEW DELHI: In order to bring down losses of perishable food items in transit, the government today launched a toll free helpline number to provide assistance to refrigerated transporters stuck in the middle of highways and ensure smooth movement of such items to markets.
The toll free calls will be handled by Mumbai-based Reefer Vehicle Call-in Centre (RVC), set up jointly by the government's National Centre for Cold-Chain Development (NCCD) and Mahindra Logistics.
The facility (toll no:18002676223) is available 24x7 for all transport operators of horticultural, livestock, dairy, pharmaceutical and other refrigerated goods.
"The essential link between source and markets is refrigerated transport, which face several bottleneck and challenges. The e-governance initiative is a step towards improving connectivity of farm produce," Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh told reporters after the launch here.
RVC will serve as a single point telephonic contact for recording all forms of in-transit bottlenecks to transport the perishables, he said.
The RVC will help create a database of bottlenecks and "the response generated from this exercise will help devise long term plans and policies to alleviate bottlenecks and thus also help in controlling inflation in perishable goods," he added.
"The information can also help transporters to re-route trips away from critical zones and improve service options for refrigerated transport services. This will also help future development of other modes of long haul transport of farm produce," NCCD CEO Pawanexh Kohli said.
Normally, the delay in movement of reefer vehicles is caused due to reasons such as long-toll lines, document verification and in some parts due to crime.
"RVC will help in identifying en-route delays for reefer transporters and will also help in long term corrective actions to redress in-transit delays," he added.
According to official data, the country has around 7,000 to 8,000 actively refrigerated trucks handling 3.6 million tonnes of perishable items.
At present, only two per cent of the country's total vegetable and fruits of 270 million tonnes is transported in refrigerated trucks.

RuPay competes with global payment firms Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc for the few customers in Asia's third largest economy able to afford a debit or credit card.
()
ET Special: All you want to know about Apple iPhone 6
MUMBAI: A government drive to expand banking services in India is giving a boost to home-grown card payment network RuPay, which expects to quadruple the number of users by March and make debit cards more acceptable in a nation where cash is still king.
Started in 2012 by a company owned by 10 local and foreign banks, RuPay competes with global payment firms Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc for the few customers in Asia's third largest economy able to afford a debit or credit card.
As of July, banks issued just under 435 million payment cards in India, a nation of 1.3 billion people. Most were debit cards.
RuPay's share of daily card transactions, however, remains small compared with the global firms, which are more established, offer both debit and credit cards and are accepted by more retailers. RuPay currently offers only debit cards.
RuPay users account for just 1.5 percent of daily card transactions of almost one million at retailers, said A.P. Hota, chief executive of the National Payments Corp of India (NPCI), which runs RuPay.
Hota told Reuters the payments network was set to grow rapidly from the government's so-called financial inclusion scheme, which aims to ensure the majority of households has a bank account within months.
Under the scheme launched late in August, Indians who open a bank account for the first time automatically get a RuPay card.
Hota said the number of RuPay users has now almost doubled from 23 million at the end of July.
By March next year, he expects that number to rise to 160 million, with more than 60 percent of the increase coming from the government scheme.
"Jan Dhan itself would provide a big opportunity for the domestic card brand to be a formidable force," said Hota, referring to the financial inclusion scheme, Jan Dhan Yojana , which means People's Wealth Scheme.
"(RuPay Card transactions are) just a drop in the ocean at the moment. But drop by drop we are increasing our size."
NPCI is also trying to lure more customers by charging banks lower fees than Visa and MasterCard, Hota added.
Visa, the world's largest credit and debit card company, declined to give its India market share, but said the country was amongst the world's fastest-growing payments markets.
"We believe Visa is well-positioned competitively," Uttam Nayak, group country manager of India and South Asia, at Visa, said in emailed comments, adding his company welcomed competition.
MasterCard did not reply to Reuters' requests seeking comment.
NPCI's shareholders include India's biggest bank, the State Bank of India , and foreign lenders Citibank and HSBC. The central bank has a nominee on its board.
The organisation plans to launch RuPay cards that will be accepted overseas through a partnership with Discover Financial Services, Hota said, and is also in talks with Japanese card network JCB about a partnership.
RuPay had aimed to issue credit cards by March 2015, but those plans have now been delayed by the government scheme, Hota said. "Rural acceptance of the Jan Dhan cards will be our priority," he added.

IESA  TCA sign MoU for make-in-India pushCentury Developers
(The department of electronics…)
NEW DELHI: Furthering Prime Minister Narendra Modi's call to foreign companies to "make in India", the India Electronics and Semiconductor Association (IESA) and Taipei Computer Association (TCA) on Thursday signed a memorandum of understanding to promote local manufacturing in the field of semiconductors and electronics.
Among the first in a series of initiatives to promote local manufacturing by tying up with Taiwan, IESA will look to capitalise on the country's experience in the field of manufacturing and electronics. TCA has set up a front office in Bangalore and its members have reviewed Karnataka, Gurgaon, Noida and Ahmedabad as potential sites to build a technology hub.
"They are seeing 200-300 acres of land, for setting up a Taiwanese hardware park. On merit they will zero in on one or two of these places," said MN Vidyashankar, president, IESA. One of Taiwan's top builders, Century Developers , has shown interest in developing these sites.
Domestic production of electronics has been a focus area of the new Indian government, which recognises that India's electronics import bill is expected to exceed $400 billion, more than the country's oil imports. Minister for communications and information technology Ravi Shankar Prasad has said several times that the government is looking to reduce the country's dependence on electronics imports.
The department of electronics and information technology (DeitY) is also looking to partner with experienced players to set up manufacturing clusters. "We have received proposals worth about Rs 70,000 crore in the last 18 months or so. All of them are from abroad-—from US, Japan, Korea, Taiwan," said DeitY joint secretary Ajay Kumar.
The discussions to partner with Taiwan in order to boost Indian manufacturing have been going on for three or four years, and several delegations comprising DeitY and industry groupings such as Manufacturers Association for Information Technology, IESA, Indian Cellular Association (ICA) and Electronics Industries Association of India have visited Taiwan to formalise terms.
ICA signed an MoU with the Taiwan Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers' Association (TEEMA) about six months ago, and is working to finalise the terms of a formal arrangement with the Institute for Information Industry (Taiwan), said ICA president Pankaj Mohindroo. His association will focus on manufacturing mobile phones and solid state lighting or LEDs, he added.
IESA further said it was in advanced stages of discussions to sign an MoU with Japan, which could be finalised within a fortnight. Experts believe that such agreements may be astepping stone for India, but it is still too early to say how these collaborations will turn out.
While the bigger companies would have made inroads into manufacturing in India already, it is the small and medium sized companies from countries such as Japan or Taiwan that would look to enter the Indian market through these collaborations.
"Traditionally, we have looked at manufacturing for the purpose of serving the Indian market. For the first time, we are now hearing the government talking about... come and manufacture for other markets," said Kumar Kandaswami, senior director at Deloitte.
India's expertise lies in making products that are complex and low volume, so it is still some way away from competing with countries such as China on scale, he added. But for manufacturing exports to become a reality, India would have to offer the same kind of conditions that competitors such as South Africa, Mexico and Indonesia offer, he added. With regard to electronics, the government is moving in the right direction, said Neel Ratan, executive director at PwC.

(FM Arun Jaitley in his Budget…)
NEW DELHI: India has so far been a destination for breaking up ships that were done with their duty on the high seas, but the country now wants to become a hub to make them as well. The shipping ministry will soon propose a string of measures to promote shipbuilding, including financial assistance in the range of 5% to 25%, to shipbuilding companies to spur local ship making industry, a senior government official has told ET. The final financial incentive will depend on the extent of indigenous goods used. A Cabinet note detailing the proposal will be moved soon."Shipbuilding sector has a huge multiplier effect on the economy.
We want to promote all the other related industries by encouraging usage of domestic components," the official said. Finance minister Arun Jaitley in his Budget speech in July had said a "comprehensive policy to promote Indian ship building industry" will be announced soon.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi too has emphasised India's underutilised potential in this sector and said that the country should occupy a place in the global shipbuilding market, citing examples of countries such as South Korea. Elaborating his Independence Day speech theme of "Come, make in India" Modi also said that his government would encourage foreign investment in shipbuilding.
He has also said how the sector would help in mobilising skilled manpower. Besides the financial assistance, the shipping ministry is also planning to start a Shipbuilding Development Corporation , which will aggregate all the ship orders of public sector units and bargain for best pricing with the ancillary units to bring down the cost. The Cabinet note will also include setting up of a Centre for Excellence in Ship Design and Research with an initial funding of Rs 10 crore.
The ministry has also been in talks with Infrastructure Finance Corporation of India and Industrial Development Bank of India for setting up a fund of Rs 15,000 crore to extend low-cost loans to shipbuilders.The proposal to extend the shipbuilding subsidy, which came to an end in March 2014, for another 10 years is also in the offing.
The government had extended the shipbuilding subsidy scheme from 2002 to 2007. During this period India's order book went up from from 0.3 million DWT (dead weight tonnage) to nearly 1.3 million DWT. Thereafter, due to the global recession, new ship orders fell significantly. Shipyards have blamed the government for not providing fiscal incentives and assistance towards having a level playing field with the competitors.
"Countries like China and Korea have done well even in the recession years because of both direct and indirect support from their governments," a shipyard association member said. The government has also called for long term cargo support from sectors like petroleum, steel and fertilisers to Indian shipping companies, so that order of vessels pick up. The shipbuilding sector has been reeling under pressure due to oversupply of vessels in the industry and the falling demand for cargo due to the global economic crisis. Most companies have either cancelled their new orders or put them on hold.

TMC has not takenany money from Saradha  says MamataComments
Breaking her silence after a barrage of accusations and the arrest of a Trinamool leader by CBI over the past few days, West Bengal chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, claimed on Friday that her party has not taken a penny from Saradha.
“Trinamool has not taken a penny from Saradha. The opposition raises this issue only before elections... We even got our own party MP (read Kunal Ghosh) arrested,” said Mamata in an interview uploaded in the party website, hours before two assembly constituencies go to the polls in Bengal.
She also said: “I am blamed for my modest background and modest education. Is it my fault that I do not have English medium schooling?” She also drew a parallel between the situation her party is facing and Sahara Group.
“Sahara sponsored Indian cricket team. Will you blame cricketers for Sahara’s activities?” said Mamata.
Blaming the Left Front government for the mess, she said, “When did the Saradha scam happen? When Left was in power. So many other chit fund scams happened during the Left Front rule like Sanchayita and Sanchita. The Congress, BJP and the Left are trying to protect the real culprits,” she said.
Coming down heavily on the media she said in the interview: “The media is engaging in smear campaign. They are peddling lies and malicious propaganda. They are not showing facts.” When asked to comment on the fact that new entrants who joined the party after the Trinamool Congress came to power in 2011 are bringing bad name to the party she said, “Every family has some bad elements. Does that mean the entire family is bad?”

India sets target of 70-75 medals at Asian Gamesprint
Indian officials aren't letting a string of administrative controversies or the withdrawal of some leading athletes dampen their expectations at the Asian Games.
"We've selected only those who have a chance to win medals," Jiji Thomson, the director-general of the Sports Authority of India (SAI), said. "It will be realistic to expect 70-75 medals."
The Indian team collected 65 medals at Guangzhou four years ago.
While recent controversies may not have a bearing on the results at Incheon when the games start next week, the late announcement of the final contingent did cause some anxiety. So did the unavailability of some leading athletes including wrestler Sushil Kumar, boxer Vijender Singh and tennis player Somdev Devvarman.
Thomson's department, which reports to the sports ministry, caused a stir recently when it advised a drastic pruning of the Asian Games contingent initially proposed by the Indian Olympic Association.
The IOA, which returned to the international fold in February after a 14-month ban for electing tainted officials, recommended 662 athletes and 280 officials in a contingent of 942, but the list was cut down to 516 athletes and 163 support staff for a total of 679.
Though the decision was praised in some quarters — athletes have sometimes complained of being accompanied by unwanted officials — the delay in announcing the final squad was widely criticised and some sports federations also resented the cutbacks.
"This kind of ad-hoc decision-making is not in the interest of sports," Hockey India secretary-general Narendra Batra said. "These decisions show that the people taking them don't have an understanding of what is required for competing in the international arena."
Compounding the problem of team selection was the world boxing body, AIBA, deregistering the Indian federation. Elections on September 11 for a new entity — Boxing India — were likely to be ratified and the boxers could be allowed to represent India rather than compete as independent athletes.
Vijender, a bronze medalist at the Beijing Olympics, withdrew due to an injury but five-time women's world champion Mary Kom made a comeback after missing out on selection in the Glasgow Commonwealth Games.
Wrestler Kumar, India's only two-time individual Olympic medalist, withdrew from the Asian Games to concentrate on the Rio Olympics in 2016. But London Olympics bronze winner Yogeshwar Dutt is confident India will still do well.
The withdrawals will hit hardest in tennis. Devvarman, who won the singles and doubles golds at Guangzhou, was among a group of players who decided to forego the Asian Games and concentrate on the pro tennis circuit.
Doubles specialist Leander Paes and Rohan Bopanna also withdrew, meaning India is unlikely to get anywhere near its count of five medals in the sport in 2010.
Rifle shooter Abhinav Bindra, India's only individual Olympic gold medalist, will have another shot at an elusive gold at the Asian Games as Indian marksmen hope to win a clutch of medals despite the presence of renowned Chinese and South Korean shooters.
In athletics, India's focus will be on discus, with Vikas Gowda in form after winning this year's Commonwealth gold, while Krishna Poonia and Seema Poonia both made the women's final at Glasgow.
The traditional rivalry with Pakistan in field hockey always evokes interest and captain Sardar Singh wants nothing less than gold.
"We're aiming for the gold as we feel this is a very good chance for us," Sardar said. "We recently beat South Korea (3-0 at World Cup match for ninth place) and Pakistan could be rusty as it did not play in some top tournaments."
Pakistan, which has won the Asian Games gold eight times, did not qualify for this year's World Cup in the Netherlands while it could not send a team to the Commonwealth Games due to a split in its national Olympic body.
The weight of expectations in badminton will be shared by Olympic bronze medalist Saina Nehwal along with the younger PV Sindhu, who has won bronze medals at two successive world championships and regarded as capable of breaking the Chinese stranglehold in the women's competition.
India is also be expected to win medals in archery with former World No 1 Deepika Kumari leading a squad that can spring a surprise in individual as well as team events.
The indigenous sport of kabaddi, which now has two professional leagues being organised out of India, should be a gold for the taking considering India has won it every time since it was introduced in 1990.
But India is again not participating in cricket and will also miss out on some medals after the scrapping of cue sports, chess and roller sports, which accounted for eight medals at Guangzhou.

Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: September 13, 2014 10:35 am | Updated: September 13, 2014 8:25 pm
Moderate to high turnout marked the bypolls held in 3 Lok Sabha and 33 assembly constituencies on Saturday spread across ten states in an exercise seen as yet another key test of Narendra Modi government’s popularity since it assumed power in May.
The polling in the three LS constituencies — Vadodara (Gujarat), Mainpuri (Uttar Pradesh), where Tej Pratap Singh Yadav, the nextgen of Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav’s extended family is making his debut, and Medak (Telangana) where BJP is locked in a straight fight with ruling TRS — was recorded at 49, 56 and 67 per cent respectively.
While the turnout was 53 per cent in the 11 assembly constituencies in UP, where BJP and its ally Apna Dal are hoping to retain all of them, the nine assembly seats in Gujarat, where the bypoll is considered as much a challenge for Anandiben Patel, Modi’s successor as chief minister, saw 49 per cent polling.
Four assembly seats in Rajasthan saw a voting figure of 66 per cent while contrasting turnout was recorded in Basirhat Dakshin and Chowringhee in West Bengal, where ruling Saradha scam-singed Trinamool Congress is seeking to retain the two seats, with 79.59 and 47.13 per cent respectively.
50 per cent voting was witnessed in Antagarh assembly segment in Maoist-hit Kanker district of Chhattisgarh while the three assembly constituencies in Assam, where ruling Congress is looking to recover some ground after the Lok Sabha poll setbacks, recorded 70 per cent polling and over 87 per cent was the turnout in Tripura’s Manu seat.
68 per cent turnout was registered in Nandigama assembly seat in Andhra Pradesh where ruling TDP is pitted against Congress.
Counting of votes is scheduled for September 16.
Stakes are high for BJP, Congress, Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh after the saffron party’s near-total sweep of the 80 seats in Lok Sabha polls just four months ago.
Mainpuri Lok Sabha seat, vacated by Mulayam Singh Yadav who had won from two LS seats including Azamgarh, is a matter of prestige for his party, BJP chief Amit Shah also faces the challenge in the bypolls in UP as he is considered the main strategist behind the party’s stupendous success in last Lok Sabha poll.
In Mainpuri, BSP and Congress have not fielded their candidates, leaving a straight contest between Tej Pratap Singh and BJP’s Shiv Singh Shakya.
While BSP, which drew a blank in Lok Sabha polls, is not contesting the bypolls in UP, Congress and SP have fielded candidates in all the 11 assembly seats and  BJP is contesting in 10 and its ally Apna Dal in one.
The outcome of the 11 bypolls in UP could be a pointer to which way the political wind is blowing in the run up to 2017 assembly polls.

MOM is in the pink of health: ISROIndia’s Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV-C25), carrying Mars orbiter. ( File photo )
PTI | Chennai | Posted: September 13, 2014 10:48 am
India’s ambitious Mars Orbiter Mission, scheduled to enter the Mars orbit later this month, is in the “pink of health” and sending vital information from a distance of 211 million km after covering 95 per cent of its journey, ISRO said.
“MOM keeps sending us vital information about the health of its various modules and measurements from sensors. This is
called Telemetry signal. Today’s telemetry confirms that MOM is in the pink of health,” Indian Space Research Organisation
said on its micro-blogging site.
“MOM uses 2.2 m High Gain Antenna to send us signals from the present distance of 211 million kilometre”, it said. ISRO said the spacecraft has completed 95 per cent of its heliocentric journey towards Mars and was less than “four million kilometres” away from it.
Scientists would undertake a “challenging task” on September 24 when they would restart the onboard liquid engine, which has been in sleep mode for nearly ten months, for a critical manoeuvre of the spacecraft. The Rs 450-crore project, named Mangalyaan, was launched from Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh on board the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle on November 5 last year with an aim to reach the red planet’s atmosphere by September 24.
The project is expected to provide the scientific community better opportunities in planetary research.

SEE Linkages focuses on green practicesStory
Strong Foundation
SEE Linkages tied up with an industry body to collect the waste it generates and also began water harvesting.
SEE Linkages MD Sameer Khera.
BT-YES Bank Best SME Survey
SEE LINKAGES
Three years ago Sameer Khera, 48, and his younger brother and partner Bhavik Khera, realised that environmental norms for companies were getting more stringent in Gujarat. Clients had also begun checking to ensure that the suppliers were compliant with various environmental and social regulations.
FULL COVERAGE: India's Best SMEs
These clients are mostly international, as about 70 per cent of the business for SEE Linkages comes from international markets. It works with companies such as ABB, GE, Emerson and Bombardier, among others.
Ask the elder Khera about why he thought it necessary for the company to put in efforts towards meeting social and environmental regulations and he says: "It's a key driver in differentiating ourselves from other companies, because overseas there is a big push."
"In our sector, very few companies do it," he adds.
The company's business operations, wherein it manufactures and supplies components and assemblages to companies, does not create a lot of contaminants. However, to dispose of whatever little waste that it generates, the company has tied up with an industry body that collects the waste once every 15 days.
"Being a small company, we are not directly in the position to manage the waste. So finding the right agency within the industrial area to manage the waste that we generate was an issue in the beginning," says Khera.
The company also focuses on water harvesting. That too is more from a business point of view. Khera says it has a lot to do with managing resources in the conditions that the company operates in. "Though we do not release any chemicals, but our machines need a lot of water and we use coolant which is used in the machines."
Khera points out that the water that is available from the civic body is very hard and using that water which would cause problems in machines, leading to the company getting into water harvesting.
Where it primarily faces challenges is internally. "One thing is to establish the mindset within the company itself and that took us time. We started about three years ago, but we've got our act together only about six to eight months back," says Khera, adding that the company keeps on going through audits: customer audits as well as from their auditing firm Dun & Bradstreet, to drive the point among employees that it is imperative to give back to the environment.
"We try to organise these every few months so that there is a movement, a feeling within the company that it is not just that the management is serious enough to do this but they're getting external people to audit it as well," he says.
However, pure play business decisions are not the only thing that drives the family-run company. The company is putting together a corpus by the name of SEE Foundation that was set up two years back and works for social causes.
"We've always been supporting some event or the other, but even though we were spending money, we felt that the effort was not showing. At least not in the way we thought it should," says Khera.
The foundation is focused on three primary areas: education and health care for the girl child, preserving and conserving the heritage in Vadodara, and nation building.
VIDEO: Have focused on welfare of girl child: SEE Linkages' MD
Why girl child specifically? We ask. "This probably comes from the fact that both me and my brother have daughters. And my sister, Reetika Khera, is also very active in the social space." The foundation funds close to 100 girls for education and is also associated with a project called Savera to support underprivileged girls. The company has also funded a Sickel Cell Anemia Project in the nearby Chhota Udaipur area.
The company, which spent about seven per cent of its profits last year on corporate social responbility initiatives, has been spending more than the stipulated two per cent according to the Companies Act for a long time now because it wants to organise the foundation in a professional way. "We're trying to build the corpus because we want this foundation to be self sustaining and we decided to fund it a little more than we would otherwise do just so that it starts making a difference and it starts showing results," says Khera.

PM Modi sends U khand IAS officer to track missingAjay Kumar Pradyot
(An IAS officer who helped…)
NEW DELHI: A "missing persons" information system is being put in place for J&K, where thousands have gone missing in the worst flooding the region has seen in decades.
An IAS officer who helped set up such a database during the Uttarakhand floods was sent to Srinagar on Wednesday to operationalize the system, the Prime Minister's Office said in a note to the home ministry after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's high-level meeting on Wednesday.
"An information system in respect of missing persons is being started on the lines of the Uttarakhand disaster in 2013 and Uttarakhand IAS officer Ajay Kumar Pradyot , along with a team of the National Informatics Centre (NIC), has been dispatched to J&K to make the system operational," said the PMO's note, a copy of which was seen by ET.
While Indian authorities have rescued about a lakh since the Jhelum swelled about a week ago due to excessive rain, thousands are still unaccounted for.
Officials put the number of dead on the Indian side of Kashmir at 163. It is feared that the death toll could go up sharply when the final count is made after flood waters recede.
Two teams from the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences in Bangalore are being sent to the valley for counseling survivors.
The Jhelum flows from India into Pakistan , where reports say over half a million people have been affected.
According to people close to the development, the PMO was impressed with the work done by Pradyot in setting up a "Missing Cell" in Uttarakhand during the 2013 disaster. The cell involved creation of a database of missing persons through a helpline phone number, e-mail, social networking websites like Twitter and Facebook and police FIRs.
"The biggest problem in J&K right now is that people are getting no information on the whereabouts of their loved ones," a home ministry official said. "The information cell being set up will be a single-window system to know who are missing and if they have been rescued."

Jammu and Kashmir: After floods  an ordeal to get water in SrinagarAs the floods ironically brought shortage of drinking water because of fear of pollution of water sources, the threat of outbreak of water-borne diseases also loomed large.
ET SPECIAL:
ET Special: All you want to know about Apple iPhone 6
SRINAGAR: "We had to hijack water". This remark in exasperation by doctors at a private hospital here today summed up the situation on how people and hospitals were desperate and at their wit's end to get water for daily use in the aftermath of the worst-ever floods in 109 years that has ravaged Jammu and Kashmir .
As the floods ironically brought shortage of drinking water because of fear of pollution of water sources, the threat of outbreak of water-borne diseases also loomed large.
For the people of Srinagar and other towns in Kashmir Valley, it has been a case of "water, water everywhere, nor any drop to drink" after the floods unleashed devastation following heavy rains for several days since September 2.
Doctors at Ahmed Hospital and Nursing Home narrated their experiences in handling the grim situation where even getting water for ordinary use was an ordeal.
"We had to hijack water. We went to the local Water Department. We sent 10 people in our ambulance. They went and hijacked a (water) tank, filled water so that we can keep the hospital clean because no one is there," one doctor, who identified himself as Dr Khan said.
Elaborating on the problems faced in treating patients, Dr Khan said bedsheets were being torn and sterlised for use in surgeries.
Even doctors were sweeping the floors in a bid to keep it clean, he said.
"There is nobody. There is no help," he said, adding, "Doctors, nurses are helping...everyone is helping. They are cleaning floors. Everybody is being asked to volunteer. But the thing is that we are short of resources."
"Nothing is coming from anywhere. There is nobody, There is no help," he said.
Dr Khan said the hospital did not need any financial support but required medicines and injectible pain killers.
"We need antibiotics , sterilised sheets for OTs(Operation Theatre. We need sterilised equipment for OTs. We need dialysis fluid. People are dying for lack of dialysis. We don't need any financial support," he said.
The problem has been further compounded since patients from government hospitals are also being sent to this hospital, he said.
Since there is no electricity supply the hospital is working on two generator sets being operated alternately.
Another doctor, who identified himself as Dr Iqbal, said the hospital has a capacity of 25 beds but since Sunday 82 cesarean operations have been conducted.
He said of all the dialysis centres in the City the unit at the hospital is the only one that is functional at present.

Plans to launch compact SUV next year
Mahindra & Mahindra will increase its range of petrol engine-powered vehicles, starting with a compact sports utility vehicle (SUV) to be launched next year.
“We are developing a 1.2-litre petrol engine, which will power the compact SUV that we will launch next year. Also, we have a 1.6-litre petrol engine available from our Korean arm Ssangyong,” Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) Executive Director Pawan Goenka told PTI.
He further said, “We can also develop a 1-litre petrol engine in quick time based on the existing platform.”
The plan to have more petrol vehicles is to offset any possible decline in demand for diesel vehicles due to the reducing price difference between petrol and diesel fuels.
Mr. Goenka said the company will manufacture two out of the three new platforms, which it has announced, at the Chakan plant.
Last month M&M had announced plans to invest Rs. 4,000 crore at the Chakan plant to take the overall capacity to 7.5 lakh units annually when fully operational. The fresh infusion would take its total investment in Chakan to Rs. 8,000 crore.
In 2013, the company had announced plans to invest Rs. 10,000 crore in three years.
When asked if the Chakan plant could be used to assemble models of the company’s South Korean arm Ssangyong, he said at the moment there were no such plans. “We don’t have immediate plans to assemble any Ssangyong models in India. However, considering the capacity that the Chakan plant would have when fully operational, we can produce a wide array of vehicles there.”
On whether the company would bring the X100 compact SUV that Ssangyong planned to lunch next year, Mr. Goenka said, “We don’t have any such plans now. Unless we assemble that in India it will not be cost competitive.”
Mr. Goenka said the company has initiated a feasibility study for a possible entry of Ssangyong in the US but it would take years before being finalised. “We don’t have any timeline for that study. Even after that, it would take 2-3 years after the Board approves any plan, if at all, for such a move. So, it is just far away,” he added.
M&M’s earlier plan to launch Scorpio pick-up truck in the US hasn’t fructified due to legal issues with its distributor and dealers following delays in launch.
Commenting on the market conditions, Mr. Goenka said the industry has seen a turnaround with sales picking up in the last four months.

(Rai also speculated that…)
NEW DELHI: Former CAG Vinod Rai has said that records indicated that the then telecom minister A Raja had kept prime minister Manmohan Singh in the loop on the course of action he planned to pursue in allocating 2G spectrum and that the PM's reluctance to chart a different course could be construed as "dereliction of duty".
Rai also speculated that coalition compulsions might have prevented Singh from heeding requests from cabinet colleagues to refer the spectrum issue to a Group of Ministers.
In an interview with Arnab Goswami of Times NOW on Thursday, Rai also said he had apprised the then FM Pranab Mukhejree of what was due to come in the report on coal. Later Mukherjee and Rai jointly met the PM to indicate the findings of the CAG report.
However, Rai refused to lay the entire blame on the former PM for the series of scams that rocked the UPA government. "I think we are laying too much of blame only on the prime minister because there are large number of functionaries who did not perform the role that their oath of allegiance they had taken to the constitution," he said.
Rai said two letters written by Raja to the PM in 2007 - on November 15 and December 16 - showed that Singh was well aware of what the DMK leader was planning to do.
"...If he had put his foot down, probably the fate and the course of UPA-2 would have been different. If he had put his foot down and stopped this process from unfolding... It could have been any other process, we are not prescribing a process... but this process was faulty in a large number of ways. And the govt has also accepted that rules and regulations were not being followed, goalposts had been shifted..." Rai said in the interview. In the months before the controversial allocation of telecom licenses in January 2008 -- at a price fixed in 2001 -- the finance ministry had pitched for auction of spectrum.
Ministers such as Kamal Nath had expressed concern at the goingson in the telecom ministry had called for a GoM to be set up.
Rai, whose controversial reports on spectrum allocations and coal block allotments had put the UPA government in a spot, is releasing his autobiography 'Not just an account, the diary of a nation's Conscience'.
With regard to Air India's purchase of aircraft during Praful Patel's term as the civil aviation minister, Rai said ministry officials came pleading "at any level" to remove a reference that the minster had "nudged" Air India to buy more planes than it had asked for.
In the Rai appeared to criticize Patel, saying that the former minister had taken considerable interest in the details of Air India's purchase, though decision such as the number of planes ought to be taken by the Air India board.
"And we took a decision to remove the word nudge because normally audit follows a very structured formulation and nudge was not a word appearing in our documents," Rai said.
Elaborating on the aftermath of the November 2010 CAG report ---which famously clamed a loss of Rs 1,76,000 crore to the exchequer---the former CAG said then Congress MPs Sanjay Nirupam, Ashwini Kumar, Sandeep Dikshit had approached him to keep the PM "out of it". But these conversations was after the report had been published.

Amazon plans portal for wholesale merchants in India, first country outside the US

(The initiative could be…)
BANGALORE: Amazon is preparing to launch a portal for wholesale merchants in India, the first country outside the US where such an initiative is being planned by the Seattle-based company.
The wholesale portal could be launched early next year, according to two people with knowledge of the plans.
"The (Amazon) India team has been working on this top secret project for the past few months. Talks with potential suppliers and the hiring process have begun," said one of the sources. "It will be similar to what Walmart is doing online in India and what Alibaba does in China."
The initiative could be led by Samir Kumar, who is currently director of category management, said a third source. The wholesale team will report to Amazon India head Amit Agarwal.
An Amazon India spokeswoman said: "As a policy, we do not comment on anything that we may or may not do in the future." Since debuting its online retail business in India last year, Amazon has grown rapidly.
Amazon has grown rapidly and aggressively in India, challenging Flipkart for market leadership in the country. Illustrating the scale of its ambition, founder Jeff Bezos announced that Amazon would invest $2 billion (Rs 12,000 crore) in India just a day after Flipkart said it had received $1 billion in funding. "It is important to note that there is no FDI restriction when it comes to online business-to-business operations," said Arvind Singhal, chairman of retail advisory firm Technopak.
The India wholesale portal will be similar to AmazonSupply, its online site in the US focused on business consumers.
The India platform will also target small and medium enterprises. However, it is not clear yet whether the company will offer all categories of products under its wholesale platform. For instance, AmazonSupply does not sell apparel and other soft lines such as furnishings. AmazonSupply was launched in 2012 and is still in 'beta', or test mode. The site, which does not have a minimum order size, sells products ranging from office supplies to electrical equipment.
Since June last year, Amazon in India has set up a network of seven warehouses across the country and has over 8,500 merchants selling products in over 28 categories on its platform. The company is estimated to be on track to reach $1 billion (Rs 6,000 crore) in sales this fiscal. One of the factors influencing decision-making at Amazon is the Chinese ecommerce group Alibaba.
Sources who briefed ET on Amazon's wholesale plans said the firm wants to quickly establish wholesale operations in India before Alibaba pays serious attention to this market. Alibaba has set up offices in India but its platform is primarily focused on connecting small and medium enterprises in India to global buyers, and not on domestic sales.
Alibaba has taken the fight to Amazon in its home market by launching a portal in the US before its public offer, which could mop up over $21 billion (Rs 1.2 lakh crore). In China , Alibaba's success has been built on the back of business-to-business transactions.
In India, too, the online channel is expected to be a disruptive force in wholesale. "The online channel can bring in efficiency," said Singhal of Technopak. "There are millions of small retailers who buy from physical wholesalers, but the system is very inefficient."
Others too have been drawn in by this opportunity. US retail giant Walmart has estimated that India's wholesale market will grow to $700 billion (Rs 42.5 lakh crore) by 2020 from the current $300 billion (over Rs 18 lakh crore). Earlier this year, it launched a business-focused site bestpricewholesale.co.in for its wholesale club members in Lucknow and Hyderabad. Technopak has estimated that the retail market in India is at $525 billion (Rs 32 lakh crore) at present and will double in size by 2020.
German retailer Metro's India brick-and-mortar wholesale cash & carry business has managed to carve out a space for itself in the decade that it has operated here. In 2013, it had incurred a loss of Rs 272 crore on a turnover of Rs 2,521 crore. The company runs about 15 outlets in India and plans to have 50 wholesale stores in the country by 2020.

Government asks companies to put brown dot on cosmetics with animal origin ingredients; IBHA opposes

animal-origin ingredients
(The Indian Beauty and Hygiene…)
MUMBAI: The Indian cosmetics industry is furious about a government diktat that shampoos, toothpastes, soaps and other items need to carry a red or brown dot indicating whether the product contains ingredients that are of animal origin, calling it unfair and accusing the Department of Consumer Affairs of issuing the notification without giving companies such as Hindustan Unilever, Procter & Gamble and Colgate Palmolive a chance to give their views.
The Indian Beauty and Hygiene Association (IBHA) has petitioned the Bombay High Court, contending that the rule is against the principles of natural justice and that the Supreme Court had dealt with the matter previously. It also said that the issue comes under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, rather than the metrology department, which has been ensuring that the rule is observed through raids on warehouses.
The Bombay High Court on Tuesday sought responses from the metrology department and the Union government within two weeks to the plea filed by IBHA against the notification. Hindustan Unilever, part of IBHA, is a copetitioner as well.
The division bench comprising justices VM Kanade and PD Kode also directed the metrology authorities not to take coercive action against the companies and posted the matter for hearing on September 23. Metrology refers to weights and measures.
"The notification has been issued without seeking comments from the industry, which is against the pre-legislative consultation policy of the government," a Hindustan Unilever spokesperson said. "It is also pertinent to clarify that this is not a subject matter of the legal metrology department."
According to the June 2014 notification issued by the Department of Consumer Affairs under the Legal Metrology Act, "Every package containing soap, shampoos, toothpastes and other cosmetics and toiletries shall bear at the top of its principal display panel a red or, as the case may be, brown dot for products of nonvegetarian origin and a green dot for products of vegetarian origin."
Products such as lipsticks and lip balms are exempt because they weigh less than 10 grams. The department had directed companies to comply with the changes from July 1.
"Soon after the development, officials from the department conducted a series of raids on the warehouses of many consumer companies and asked them to stop distributing the products," said a senior executive who didn't want to be identified. "This current situation has put many companies in trouble."
Companies are concerned that consumers may be put off by red or brown dots, especially since many Indians profess themselves to be vegetarians, although technological advances mean that such ingredients are no longer used in many instances, according to analysts. Still, green-dot methods of manufacture could involve costlier inputs and thus higher retail prices or narrower margins.
IBHA has 32 members including local units of multinationals such as L'Oreal India, Procter & Gamble Hygiene and Health Care, Colgate Palmolive (I), Nivea India and Johnson & Johnson besides Indian companies such as ITC , Dabur India , Godrej Consumer and Marico.
Hindustan Unilever, the country's largest consumer goods company, gets about 75 per cent of its sales or nearly Rs 20,000 crore from its home and personal products division.
The company is by far the market leader in segments such as soap, shampoo and skin cream. However, many global rivals are fast catching up, with Colgate controlling more than half the oral care market while L'Oreal and Procter & Gamble are stealing away market share in the premium skin care and shampoo segments.
The overall home and personal care market is estimated to be more than Rs 1 lakh crore, accounting for nearly 40 per cent of the overall fastmoving consumer goods (FMCG) market. Raj Panchmatia, a partner at Khaitan & Co, which is representing the industry grouping, confirmed the development but refused to give any details because the matter was sub judice, he said.

Ford Motor Company plans to launch four new car models in India and is looking to increase the amount of locally-made parts to reduce the cost of its vehicles sold in the country, the head of its local unit said on Friday.
American automaker Ford's sales in India have increased 9.5 per cent to 84,469 vehicles in the fiscal year that ended on March 31, pushing its market share up to 3.4 per cent from 2.9 per cent a year ago, industry data showed.
"Within the next 18-20 months we plan to launch four new models in India," Nigel Harris, president of Ford India, told Reuters in an interview. He declined to elaborate.
Ford had said in 2010 it would launch 8 vehicle models in India, based on its global car platforms, by the end of 2015, a target the company is unlikely to meet due to the economic slowdown and sluggish car sales in the country.
"We will be close to that, but couple of the models will be deferred by a couple of years," said Harris.

Rupee logs sixth weekly rise  to 60.65Forex Update: Rupee logs sixth weekly rise, ends at 60.65 against dollar

The rupee on Friday gained 28 paise, notching up its best daily gain in a month, to end strong at 60.65 against the American currency on heavy dollar selling by banks and exporters amid positive cues from equity markets .
A weak US dollar overseas and capital inflows also helped the rupee rally for the second straight day, forex dealers said. This helped the domestic unit to end with gain of 26 paise for the week, the sixth straight weekly rise.
Against its major global rivals, the dollar index was trading lower by 0.03 per cent. This was ahead of some economic data and the US Federal Reserve's meeting on rates early next week.
At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market, the domestic unit commenced lower at 60.97 a dollar from last close of 60.93 and immediately touched a low of 61.03.
It later rebounded on dollar selling by exporters and some banks amid better domestic stocks to a high of 60.6450, settling finally at 60.65, with a rise of 28 paise (0.46 per cent).
The rupee recorded its best daily gain since the 45-paise rise on August 14, 2014.
Trading range  for the spot rupee is expected to be within 60.10 to 61.00, said Pramit Brahmbhatt, CEO, Veracity Group.
The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) Sensex on Friday recouped 65.17 points, or 0.24 per cent, ahead of the announcement of key macro economic data later in the day today. FPIs/FIIs had picked up shares worth US $77.48 million on Thursday, as per provisional data.
The government released industrial production (IIP) data for July , which showed industrial output grew 0.5 per cent, and August inflation based on consumer price index (CPI), which eased to 7.08 per cent on year-on-year basis.

Weak Industry  Stubborn Inflation Hinder India s Economic RecoveryHSBC Sees Higher India Growth, Lower Inflation in Coming Quarters
New Delhi: India's industrial output growth hit a four-month low in July while inflation remained high, underscoring the challenge for Asia's third-largest economy to make a sustained recovery from its longest stretch of sub-par growth in decades.
Output from mines, utilities and factories grew by a much slower-than-expected 0.5 per cent year-on-year, government data showed on Friday, down from June's revised 3.9 per cent rise.
Output growth hit a 19-month high of 5.0 per cent in May.
Retail inflation, which the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) tracks for setting lending rates, edged down marginally to 7.8 per cent in August from 7.96 per cent a month earlier, helped by slower annual rises in prices of fuel and clothes.
The numbers come after the economy posted its fastest growth in 2-1/2 years in the quarter to June, helped by a revival in industry. Prime Minister Narendra Modi seized on that figure to highlight the "huge positive sentiment" behind India's recovery.
However, high inflation would make it tougher for Mr Modi to encourage Indian consumers, who power nearly 60 per cent of the economy, to loosen their purse strings. It would also make the central bank wary of lowering interest rates later this month.
The RBI, which wants to reduce retail inflation to 6 per cent by 2016, left interest rates steady last month, citing inflationary risks from a late monsoon.
While better rainfall in recent weeks, falling global crude prices, moderating vegetable prices and a favourable statistical base will likely help inflation lower, rates are widely expected to remain on hold when the RBI reviews them on September 30.
"The outlook on inflation seems less discomforting than it was a month back," says Upasna Bhardwaj, an economist at Ing Vysya bank, in Mumbai.
"We continue to expect that RBI will keep its policy rate unchanged through fiscal year 2014-15 (March 2015) with a probable action mid-next year."
The prospects of a revival in demand-driven price pressures following a pick-up in economic activity and sooner-than-expected interest rate increases in the US are also expected to weigh on the apex bank's rate decision.
Any decision by the Federal Reserve to raise rates, which have been held near zero since December 2008, will have implications for India, as it could lead to capital outflows, weakening the rupee and inflating costs of imported commodities.
Mr Modi won India's strongest electoral mandate in 30 years in May, vowing to lift sliding economic growth, cool inflation and create enough jobs for its young workforce.
The optimism fanned by Mr Modi's rise to power has already brought inflows of nearly $14 billion of foreign funds into Indian equities this year as investors bet that his drive to cut red tape would revive stalled projects and underpin the economic recovery.
To sustain this euphoria, economists say Mr Modi must overhaul India's strained public finances, stringent land acquisition laws, chaotic tax regime and rigid labour rules.
During his first 100 days in office, the new prime minister showed little appetite for such structural changes, and there is concern that sharply higher growth in the last quarter could obviate the urgency to press ahead with them.
"The pro-business government has facilitated the investment climate and boosted confidence, but more needs to be done to get back to a period of high growth and low inflation," said Rohini Malkani, an analyst at Citi.

Overall market sentiment continues to look bullishDipak Mondal      Follow @dipdown80    Last Updated: September 13, 2014  | 14:00 IST
(Photo: Reuters)
After three weeks of steep rise, large-cap equity indices took a pause this week. The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensex and the National Stock Exchange Nifty ended the week flat due to profit-taking and weak global cues.
The Sensex closed the week at 27,061, up 35 points, or 0.13 per cent, from the last week's close, while Nifty closed at 8,105, a gain of 0.23 per cent.
The week was marked by volatility as the Nifty, which touched a high of 8,180 on Monday, struggled to close above 8,100 due to selling pressure later in the week.  The Sensex touched a high of 27,355 on Monday and a low of 26,905 on Thursday.
Among Sensex stocks, Cipla (10%), SBI (4.6%), HUL (3.24%), Bharti (3.22%) and Maruti Suzuki (3.16%) were the top gainers, while Sun Pharma (-6.03%), NTPC (-3.57%), Coal India (-3.4%) and ONGC(-3.36%) were the top losers.
The broader market, though, continued to be upbeat. The BSE 500 index rose 1 per cent during the week. But mid-cap and small-cap stocks made healthy gains. BSE Mid-cap and BSE Small-cap indices rose 3.25% and 5%, respectively, during the week.
Though there were no big domestic triggers, globally, the US' aggressive stand against ISIS in Iraq and the EU's plan for tougher sanctions against Russia weighed down on markets. "Indian benchmarks ended on a flattish note. Given the sideways movement in frontline stocks, investor interest shifted to mid-caps. There was a sharp up move in auto component and fertilisers stocks and select midcaps," says Sanjeev Zarbade, vice president, Private Client Group Research, Kotak Securities.
Among sectors, auto, FMCG and banking were top gainers. BSE Auto, FMCG and  Bankex indices rose 2%, 1.8% and 1.7%, respectively. Among the top losers were BSE Oil & Gas and BSE IT (0.9% and 0.7%, respectively). Real estate and capital goods sector also closed the week in the negative territory.
Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) remained upbeat. They were net buyers of equities worth Rs 2,221 crore. Mutual funds were net sellers of shares worth Rs 356 crore.
According to Neelesh Surana, head of equities, Mirae Asset Mutual Fund, things have moved too fast in the last one month and probably fund managers are a little cautious about valuations in the short term. "However, we remain positive in the longer term," he says.  
In the coming week, equity markets will take cues from Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Index of Industrial Production  (IIP) data. CPI grew at slower pace of 7. 8% in August as against 7.96% in July. This will enhance chances of a softer RBI stance on interest rates.
There was some disappointment on the IIP front as it grew at a much slower rate of 0.5% in July compared to 3.9% in June. However, the overall growth between April-July is 3.3% compared to -0.1% in the same period last year. The data were released after market hours.
"We are hopeful of a rebound in manufacturing as demand picks up by end of the current quarter," says Debopam Chaudhuri, chief economist, ZyFin Research.
The overall sentiment continues to look bullish.
According to Rajshekar, senior research analyst, HBJ Capital, next week will see the Nifty consolidate between 8,000 and 8,200 levels, with 8,000 acting as a pivotal support and resistance coming at 8,200 levels.
"Technically, the Nifty is making higher top and higher bottom pattern and we would like to extend the target  to 8300 by September-end and 8500 by October-end," he says.

 Manufacturing May Not be Out of the Woods: India IncHSBC Sees Higher India Growth, Lower Inflation in Coming Quarters
New Delhi: With industrial production growth coming down to a four-month low, India Inc said on Friday that manufacturing may not out be out of the woods even as it hoped for positive investments and infrastructure-driven environment to boost growth.
"The muted performance of the industrial sector...on the back of the negative growth of the manufacturing sector indicates that a full-fledged industrial recovery could still be some distance away," Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) Director General Chandrajit Banerjee said.
A decline in manufacturing output and lower offtake of consumer durables pulled down industrial production growth to a 4-month low of 0.5 per cent in July.
"While we were hoping that slowdown in manufacturing had bottomed out, it appears from July numbers that manufacturing may not out be out of the woods. It is worrying that deceleration in July is somewhat broad based extending to consumer durables and capital goods," Ficci President Sidharth Birla said.
"We look forward to the positive investment and infrastructure driven environment, and a robust decision making mechanism to improve ease of doing business, as also indicated by Prime Minister, to fully carry forward the policy of Make in India and boost manufacturing," he added.
The factory output, as measured by the Index of Industrial Production (IIP), had grown by 2.6 per cent in
July, 2013.
"It all indicates that the new-found euphoria needs to be backed by concrete policy action in order to see sustainable growth," Assocham Secretary General D S Rawat said.
The industry chamber further said that it would like policymakers to consider making interest rates charged from the investors and consumers competitive, terming the step as "necessary" especially for reviving consumer durables demand in the festive season.
"Focus on structural reforms in terms of ease of doing businesses, simplification of tax structure and focus on industrial infrastructure would be critical to revive and sustain manufacturing growth trajectory in the coming times," PHD Chamber President Sharad Jaipuria said.

Railways for glass-domed coaches on scenic r...Araku Valley
(Tourists on Vishakhapatnam-Araku…)
New Delhi: The best way to reach Araku Valley in Andhra Pradesh is to take a train from Vishakhapatnam — and it's about to get better. Tourists on this route will be the first in the country to sit inside glass-domed coaches that will allow them to take in the spectacular views along the route.
The train that runs between Vishakhapatnam and Araku will initially have two coaches with windows and roofs made of special shatter-resistant glass to provide an all-round view of the valley to travellers during the four-hour, 130-km journey. Similar services are offered by train operators in Switzerland and the Canadian Rockies.
The picturesque Araku Valley, located at an elevation of about 3,000 feet in the Eastern Ghats , is rich in thick forests and is known for its coffee plantations. An initiative of the Ministry of Tourism, the glassdomed coaches will be available by the end of March 2015 and the project could be replicated on other scenic routes, including between Baramulla and Qazigund in Kashmir Valley.
"We have no doubt that in Kashmir there would be great demand due to the high tourist footfalls in the state. In Araku, we will assess the interest it generates," a senior government official said. The viability of the project will depend on the response of passengers, who will pay premium fares for such coaches.
The tourism ministry will pay Rs 4 crore to the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation, a unit of the Indian Railways , to provide the domestically manufactured, air-conditioned coaches. In the pilot run, the fares for these coaches are likely to be 5 per cent higher than the normal AC coach ticket. "Product innovation is essential to promoting tourism. We have to create those wow factors to attract tourists and give them a reason to explore newer places in India," said Arjun Sharma, managing director of Le Passage to India, a travel company headquartered in New Delhi.
Andhra Pradesh ranks third in domestic tourism, having drawn more than 15 crore visitors in 2013, according to ministry data, and is next only to Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh. The state's main attraction is the pilgrimage centre of Tirupati and lesser known parts such as the Araku Valley will need to be promoted to make initiatives such as the glass-domed train coaches successful.

Telangana bypoll: Triangular contest for Medak Lok Sabha seat#telangana #telangana election #medak #lok sabha seat #k chandrahsekhar rao #congress #bjp #tdp #trs
Hyderabad: 2:15 PM: Over 30 per cent polling recorded till noon.
Voting has begun for bypoll in Medak Lok Sabha constituency in Telangana, necessitated by the resignation of Telangana Rashtra Samiti president K Chandrashekhar Rao after he became chief minister.
The bypoll witnessed a spirited campaign with ruling TRS, main Opposition Congress and the BJP-TDP combine making a determined bid to win the election.
Telangana Rashtra Samiti president K Chandrashekhar Rao resigned from Lok Sabha seat after he became chief minister.
The poll fight is important for all the three major parties as TRS looks to retain the seat, while Congress wants to salvage its prestige by securing the constituency in the wake of its failure to win the Legislative Assembly elections despite delivering on the separate statehood demand.
The BJP, contesting on behalf of the alliance with TDP, is looking to boost its prospects in the newly-carved state by wresting the constituency from the ruling party.
Rao addressed a poll meeting in Medak district two days ago in support of TRS candidate K Prabhakar Reddy, while state ministers and other party leaders have campaigned hard to ensure his victory. Medak is the native district of Rao.
Th BJP pulled off a surprise by fielding former Congress MLA T Jayaprakash Reddy, a bitter critic of TRS, and the alliance leaders undertook extensive canvassing to give the ruling party a run for its money.
Union Ministers and BJP leaders Prakash Javadekar and DV Sadananda Gowda addressed public meetings in Medak district on Thursday in support of Jayaprakash Reddy.
The Congress has fielded former Minister V Sunita Laxma Reddy and several state leaders of the party campaigned, though no major national figure took part in electioneering.
Election Commission has made elaborate arrangements for smooth conduct of the polling, whose result will be known on September 16.
A total number of 15,43,700 electors are elibile to exercise their franchise at 1,817 polling stations in the Lok Sabha seat, where 14 candidates are in fray.
Besides 4,213 state police personnel, 17 companies of central forces (around 1,700 men) have been deployed in the constituency, where 9,086 polling staff will be on duty.
Ever since the election schedule was announced in mid-August, the authorities have seized Rs 75.24 lakh unaccounted cash and 4,549 litres of liquor.

Crime Branch begins probe into AAP s bribe allegations against BJP#delhi police #delhi assembly elections 2014 #aam aadmi party #aap #sher singh dagar #bjp
New Delhi: The Crime Branch of Delhi Police has taken up investigation into the alleged sting operation done by Aam Aadmi Party which purportedly showed BJP state unit vice-president Sher Singh Dagar offering bribe to AAP MLA for switching side.
Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) Ravindra Yadav confirmed that the Crime Branch is investigating the case. He, however, clarified that no FIR has been registered in this connection. Although Yadav refused to divulge much details about the nature of the probe, he said, "Whatever is needed will be done."
A delegation of the AAP led by party chief Arvind Kejriwal had yesterday met Delhi Police Commissioner BS Bassi and demanded Dagar's arrest. Bassi had then referred the case to Crime Branch.
Police confirmed that the Crime Branch is investigating the case but clarified that no FIR has been registered in the case.
In a letter written to Bassi, AAP legislator from Sangam Vihar Dinesh Mohaniya, who the party had claimed was offered a bribe of Rs 4 crore by Dagar, demanded that an FIR be registered in the case and a thorough investigation be conducted.
"An FIR should be registered in the case and Sher Singh Dagar should be immediately arrested for offering bribe. The police should also investigate who is the high command Dagar is seen talking about in the sting. The high command should also be arrested," the letter had said.
Kejriwal had also submitted a video copy of the "sting". After the alleged sting operation, the BJP had issued a show-cause notice to Dagar and sought his response in this matter.

Fishermen killing: SC allows Italian marine to return home for treatmentPrint

Written by Utkarsh Anand | New Delhi | Posted: September 12, 2014 2:56 pm | Updated: September 12, 2014 4:31 pm
The Supreme Court on Friday allowed Massimiliano Latorre, one of the Italian marines facing murder charges in India, to head back home for treatment for four months on medical grounds
A bench led by Chief Justice R M Lodha however rejected the undertaking furnished by Latorre, and asked him to furnish an “unambiguous and unequivocal” fresh undertaking for the court order to become operational.
The bench however accepted the undertaking by the Italy Ambassador on behalf of the Republic of Italy, assuring return of Latorre to India after 4 months.
Meanwhile, Freddy, an eyewitness and a victim of the firing incident, told the court he did not want to press his application opposing Latorre’s plea.
Freddy, in his plea, had earlier submitted that medical examination of Latorre was necessary because of the previous conduct of the marines.
“In an extreme step they refused to return to India claiming diplomatic immunity and which reached to the extent of serious diplomatic issues between two countries,” he had pointed out.
The court had on September 8 sought the Centre’s clear stand on whether it has any “serious objection” on the plea of Latorre to travel to his country for two months for treatment in the wake of brain stroke suffered by him.
It had also exempted Latorre for two weeks from appearing before the Chanakyapuri Police Station once a week as a condition of his bail. The case will be heard next on Friday.

Kolkata, Sept 13:  
Voting today began on a brisk note for by-elections to three Lok Sabha and 33 Assembly constituencies spread across ten states, seen as a test for Narendra Modi Government’s popularity, especially as BJP braces for polls in two states next month.
Uttar Pradesh
Amid elaborate security arrangements, polling was being held in 11 Assembly seats and one Lok Sabha seat in Uttar Pradesh, where the stakes are high for BJP. Around nine per cent votes were cast in the first two hours, according to poll officials.
The election comes after the saffron party’s near-total sweep of the 80 seats in Lok Sabha polls just four months ago.
Eleven Assembly seats felt vacant after 10 BJP MLAs and one of its allies Apna Dal were elected to the Lok Sabha.
BJP chief Amit Shah also faces the challenge in UP bypolls as he was credited with the party’s stupendous success.
LS bypolls
The three Lok Sabha bypolls are in Vadodara (Gujarat), Mainpuri (Uttar Pradesh) and Medak (Telangana). Among the Assembly seats, nine in Gujarat, four in Rajasthan, two in West Bengal, five in northeastern states and one each in Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh are going to polls today.
Counting of votes is scheduled for September 16.
Retaining Mainpuri Lok Sabha seat, vacated by SP supremo Mualayam Singh Yadav who had won from two LS seats including Azamgarh, is a matter of prestige for his party. BSP and Congress have not fielded their candidates, leaving a straight contest between Tej Pratap Singh and BJP’s Shiv Singh Shakya.
The 11 Assembly seats in UP, whose outcome may be a pointer to which way the political wind is blowing in the run-up to 2017 Assembly polls, are Saharanpur Nagar, Noida, Thakurdwara, Bijnor, Nighasan, Balha, Sirathu, Rohaniya, Hamirpur, Charkhari and Lucknow East. All of these were vacated by BJP MLAs who won the Lok Sabha elections.
Vadodara LS seat
In Gujarat, Narendra Modi’s successor as Chief Minister Anandiben Patel faces her first big test in by-elections being held today for Vadodara LS seat, vacated by Modi, and in nine Assembly constituencies.
This is the first election in Gujarat in more than 12 years that BJP would be fighting without its star campaigner Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Bypolls in AP
Polling began on a swift note for the by-election to Medak Lok Sabha seat in Telangana and Nandigama (SC) Assembly seat in Andhra Pradesh.
By-election is being held in Medak as the Lok Sabha seat was vacated by Telangana Rashtra Samiti chief K Chandrasekhar Rao upon becoming Chief Minister of the newly-formed Telangana state.
Medak LS seat, once part of undivided Andhra Pradesh and now in Telangana, witnesses a triangular contest between ruling TRS, BJP, and Congress. The bypolls were necessitated as TRS chief and Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao vacated the seat.
On the other hand, TDP is trying hard to prove it won’t be easy to conquer its bastion Nandigama assembly in Krishna district where it is in a direct fight against Congress. The by-election was held due to the death of TDP MLA Tangirala Prabhakara Rao within days of his victory.
Voting was also underway in the lone insurgency-hit Antagarh assembly constituency in Chhattisgarh where only two candidates are in the fray.
West Bengal
In West Bengal, Chowringhee and Dakshin Bashirhat Assembly seats had been won by CPI(M) and Trinamool Congress for which the bypolls are a crucial test for Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s popularity.
Buyoed by its modest gains in Lok Sabha elections in West Bengal and relying on Modi’s charisma, BJP hopes to wrest the Bashirhat Dakshin seat from Trinamool and make its debut in the State Assembly.
Assembly elections will be held in Maharashtra and Haryana in a single phase on October 15.

Over 65 per cent polling was reported in the bye-elections of the Medak Lok Sabha seat in Telangana and the Nandigama (SC) Assembly seat in Andhra Pradesh, as polling came to a close at 6 PM on Saturday.
The exact polling percentage will be known only late in the night, officials in the Chief Electoral Office here said.
TRS’ K Prabhakar Reddy is locked in a contest with BJP’s T Jayaprakash Reddy in Medak, the seat vacated by K Chandrasekhar Rao on becoming the Chief Minister of Telangana.
The Chief Minister exercised his franchise at Chintamadaka, his native village under Siddipet segment.
In Narsapur Assembly segment under Medak parliamentar constituency, over 75 per cent polling was reported. Siddipet and Dubbaka recorded over 65 per cent polling, followed by Medak (64) and Sangareddy (60).
In Gazwel Assembly segment, represented by the Chief Minister, more than 66 per cent polling was recorded.
In Nandigama in AP, polling picked up in the latter half of the day to cross 65 per cent mark.
Here, by-poll was held following death of MLA-elect Tangirala Prabhakar. His daughter Sowmya fought the bye-election as Telugu Desam Party nominee against B Babu Rao of the Congress.

MOM is in the pink of health:ISROIndia’s Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV-C25), carrying Mars orbiter. ( File photo )
PTI | Chennai | Posted: September 13, 2014 10:48 am
India’s ambitious Mars Orbiter Mission, scheduled to enter the Mars orbit later this month, is in the “pink of health” and sending vital information from a distance of 211 million km after covering 95 per cent of its journey, ISRO said.
“MOM keeps sending us vital information about the health of its various modules and measurements from sensors. This is
called Telemetry signal. Today’s telemetry confirms that MOM is in the pink of health,” Indian Space Research Organisation
said on its micro-blogging site.
“MOM uses 2.2 m High Gain Antenna to send us signals from the present distance of 211 million kilometre”, it said. ISRO said the spacecraft has completed 95 per cent of its heliocentric journey towards Mars and was less than “four million kilometres” away from it.
Scientists would undertake a “challenging task” on September 24 when they would restart the onboard liquid engine, which has been in sleep mode for nearly ten months, for a critical manoeuvre of the spacecraft. The Rs 450-crore project, named Mangalyaan, was launched from Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh on board the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle on November 5 last year with an aim to reach the red planet’s atmosphere by September 24.
The project is expected to provide the scientific community better opportunities in planetary research.

Fearful of missing the bus  VCs compete with angel investors to fund startupsFearful of missing the bus, venture capitalists are now catching startups at birth
Madhav Chanchani, ET Bureau Sep 13, 2014, 11.04AM IST

(Venture capitalists are…)
BANGALORE: Venture capitalists in India are realising that it is better to be an early bird than a late latif when it comes to investing in startups, especially in hot sectors where valuations soar quickly. This is pushing them to take on riskier but smaller bets in earlystage funding rounds of startups as they are apprehensive of missing the bus if they enter later.
Take the case of Manjunath Talwar and Abhijit Khasnis, former Yahoo executives and co-founders of recruitment startup Mynoticeperiod. com, who were close to finalising their first round of funding in July. But instead of closing the round from only a large group of angels, a VC firm approached them with similar terms. Typically, VCs invest in a series-A or B round, not a seed funding round for an eight-month-old startup. The duo decided to keep only select few angel investors in the over-Rs 2 crore funding led by IDG Ventures India that was announced last week.
"VCs have a longer term outlook and deeper pockets to participate in future rounds. It also helped bring in angel investors more quickly, as it makes them comfortable," said 38-year-old Talwar.
The deal highlights the rising interest of VCs in relatively riskier seed deals. IDG Ventures has set up a seed programme, where it will look to make six-seven investments of up to Rs 3 crore in the next 12-18 months. And IDG Ventures is not alone. VC firms such as SAIF Partners and Matrix Partners India have also been actively investing in seed stage over the past 12-18 months. Other VC firms like Helion Ventures, Mayfield and Lightspeed are also looking at such deals.
IDG Ventures' first seed investment was mobile ad retargeting platform Silver-Push in April. "This is a well-defined strategy for us. We will make investment in the initial cycle of our new fund as seed stage investments may take time to mature," said Venkatesh Peddi, vice-president at IDG Ventures. Bejul Somaia, MD at Lightspeed Venture Partners India which has closed three seed deals in the past nine months, said there is increased activity around Internet and mobile. "Another reason is that valuations tend to get high for later stage rounds," said Somaia.
Mayfield, which recently led a seed investment in video interview platform Talview, is also actively eyeing more deals at the stage. The firm recently hired Sweta Aggarwal as venture advisor from Indian Angel Network (IAN) to work on earlystage deals.
 
"Younger entrepreneurs are building companies to sell as compared with family-funded businesses which are built for legacy. They are building companies and products that are smarter, better and cheaper," said Mayfield Managing Director Nikhil Khattau.
Other VCs such as Helion Venture Partners are also looking at the space much more actively.
"We evaluate approximately 80-100 companies each year under serious consideration, which we call priority companies. Earlier 10 per cent of that was from seed, but now that has changed to at least 30-40 per cent of this deal flow," said Ritesh Banglani, partner at Helion, which has $600 million (Rs 3,600 crore) under management.
Experts feel that startups, especially in consumer Internet and mobile, are scaling up much faster and there is increasing competition for deals as well. "A lot of the companies are moving very fast from seed stage to series-A/B and the idea is to identify and get in early in those companies," said Peddi of IDG Ventures.
While earlier participation in seed deals was limited due to management bandwidth at VC firms, entrepreneurs come with better pedigree in company building. Also, mentoring is widely available.
SAIF Partners and Sequoia are roping in angels as mentors while others such as IDG Ventures and Lightspeed are taking board seats and becoming more actively involved with a relatively smaller seed portfolio.
This has meant that VCs now compete directly with angels for certain deals.
"The boundary between an angel investor and venture capital firm is shrinking. At IAN we are doing $1 million (Rs 6 crore) cheques, and angels are also sometimes losing out to VCs in deals," said Sanjay Mehta, a Mumbai-based investor who has backed 23 startups, including online lingerie store PrettySecrets.
But even as more VCs get active in the space, entrepreneurs should be aware of "signalling risk" where startups' ability to raise series-A gets impaired if existing VC decides not to participate in the future round.
Lightspeed's Somaia said while some investors can look at seed investments as an option to participate in series A round, for a startup it can be hurtful. "We have an open dialogue with the entrepreneur that to fund in series A, these will be the expectations that you need to meet," he said.
Helion's Banglani said it's a risk that entrepreneurs need to take, "but benefits of raising seed from an institutional investor outweigh the risks".
Also, entrepreneurs need to be cautious of the capital they take at the seed stage. An angel investor, on condition of anonymity, said while VCs may offer more cash and relatively better valuations, startups should carefully consider large dilutions that may happen with these rounds.

Ahead of Maha polls  Congress & NCP iron out differences  hope for 2009 reduxAhmed Patel
(“Out of 9 seats that Congress…)
MUMBAI: Congress will part with nine extra seats to NCP for the Maharashtra assembly polls, top leaders told ET. Congress would contest 165 seats and NCP 123 seats, according to an agreement reached between top leaders of both parties.
"Sonia Gandhi's political secretary Ahmed Patel and NCP leader Praful Patel would sit through the final round of discussion and announce the formula for Maharashtra assembly polls very soon," a top state leader of the NCP told ET. "We decided at a meeting held by Sharad Pawar on Monday that only two top leaders should now meet to finalise the list. The process is likely to be completed before the weekend," he added.
In 2009, Congress had contested 174 seats, while NCP fielded candidates in 114 constituencies out of a total 288. NCP wanted 144 seats this time, but Congress rejected the demand, following which there were four rounds of talks with NCP leaders to reach a mutually agreeable pact.
"Thought there has been some disagreement over seat sharing, it is certain that we will finally reach a seat-sharing pact. There was a demand from activists and party workers in most places that we should get 50% seats, which we put forth. We might be close to reaching an agreement now," Maharashtra's Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar said.
NCP feels that it still retains foothold in western Maharashtra and wants to get as many seats from the region. There are some disagreements over many seats in Konkan, where NCP has recently made inroads but Congress insists on more seats.
"Out of the nine seats that Congress would offer NCP from its quota, eight seats are where independents candidates have won in 2009 assembly polls," said an officebearer of the Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee .

Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit set to usher in $100 billion

China President Xi's India Visit
(Jinping will land in Modi's…)
MUMBAI: Chinese president Xi Jinping will bring along with him $100 billion or Rs 6 lakh crore of investment commitments over five years during his upcoming India visit next week.
This is nearly thrice the $35 billion secured by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his Japan trip.
Jinping will land in Modi's home state Gujarat on September 17 — the Prime Minister's birthday — following his visit of Tajikistan, Maldives and Sri Lanka.
Confirming this, Liu Youfa, China's consul-general in Mumbai, told TOI, "On a conservative estimate, I can say that we will commit investments of over $100 billion or thrice the investments committed by Japan during our President Xi Jinping's visit next week. These will be made in setting up of industrial parks, modernization of railways, highways, ports, power generation, distribution and transmission, automobiles, manufacturing, food processing and textile industries."
The consul-general's statements coincide with Modi's call for world class infrastructure projects after his review of major infrastructure sectors on Friday. The government also announced new projects worth Rs 9 lakh crore in energy, power, and roads.
China will initially invest $7 billion in industrial parks in Pune and Gandhinagar. "The Pune industrial park — spread across 5 square kilometres with an investment of $5 billion — will be for automobiles that will employ one lakh people and manufacture 1.5 lakh speciality vehicles. The Gujarat industrial park will be for manufacturing power equipment. China is also working on setting up an industrial park in Tamil Nadu for the textile sector and another one for the food processing sector," said Liu.
China is willing to invest another $50 billion in roads, ports and the NDA government's ambitious river-linking plan. "India has over 600 reservoirs that need dredging work to provide better irrigation systems for the farmers. We are looking to work on that. Besides, our major thrust will be on construction of roads and ports," said Liu.
On Friday, road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari announced the launch of new roads and highways projects this year worth Rs 2 lakh crore.
Power minister Piyush Goyal said that $100 billion of investments are likely to flow into India's renewable sector in the next four years. Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan, while meeting Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik, said that Odisha alone will receive about Rs 1 lakh crore worth of investment in the next five years in petrochemicals, oil & gas pipelines, LNG & LPG terminals, and strategic oil reserves to make it the 'energy gateway for eastern India.
The Chinese president is coming with a delegation of over 100 business heads, including those from China Harbour, China Railway Construction Group and Huawei, among others, and will address a business gathering of over 400 Indian CEOs in Delhi.
The big four Chinese banks — Bank of China, Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), China Construction Bank and the Agriculture Bank of China — are also coming with the delegation to give billions of dollars in loans to Indian infrastructure projects to be done in joint venture with Chinese firms.
"All major JV projects will be funded by Chinese banks. Major corporate houses like Tatas, Infosys, Reliance and Essar have already taken loans from these banks and the funding will only increase," said Liu.

PM Narendra Modi’s rise from Vadnagar to 7, Race Course Road, spawns a huge publishing opportunity
Vasudha Venugopal, ET Bureau Sep 13, 2014, 07.00AM IST

Accidental Prime Minister
(Bookshop at BJP office in…)
NEW DELHI: Three weeks ago in Mumbai, Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani released a picture book on Prime Minister Narendra Modi containing what were said to be rare pictures of the man, chronicling his journey from Vadnagar, a small village in Gujarat, to 7 Race Course in New Delhi.
Around the same time in New Delhi, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley released a coffee table book on the prime minister titled, Being Modi. "Did you know that Modi was hiding in a basement of a house during the Emergency, suffering from jaundice? Or that his family still remembers the excellent sabudana khichdi he makes," co-author Nikita Parmar says.
The 25-year-old Delhi High Court lawyer travelled extensively throughout Gujarat last year to get to grips with Modi's personal story. "I have interviews of his old friends, close family members. People are bored of reading about his political life now, that is why I chose to find out more about his family and personal habits," she adds.
Modi's rise has spawned a huge publishing industry, with more than 80 books being released on him in different languages in the past few months alone. Most of them are in Hindi and Gujarati, and are usually released by a dignitary.
These are written by former journalists, lawyers, RSS workers and one by his bodyguard. Priced between Rs 45 and Rs 500, there are books of all kinds on the PM — comics, picture books and political biographies among others.
These include Durdrashta Narendra Modi, Ghar Ghar Modi, Bhavishya Ki Asha--Narendra Modi, Narendra Modi Ka Rajnitik Safar, Narendra Modi --Sangarsh Se Shikar Tak, Swarnim Gujarat Na Modi, Mahanayak Narendra Modi and Prernamurthy Narendra Modi. The titles in English are varied: Narendra Modi, Yes he Can, Modi -- Man of Developing India, Modi Demystified, Modi: Change We Can Believe In, This is Narendra Modi, Modimantra among others. Modi's biographies have also been translated into Chinese and French, and those written by the PM himself - Samajik Samarasta, Sakshibhaan, Aapatkal Mein Gujarat - are prominently displayed in bookstores.
Navbharat Sahitya Mandir, one of the largest Gujarati publishing houses in the country, has issued a series of books on Modi. It's now looking at "unheard stories of the PM" to tell people, said proprietor Ronak Shah .
Shah refers to Gujarati writer and translator Aditya Vasu, who has authored books such as Narendra Modi ki Jeevan Katha and Namovaani. Vasu, 78, used to be a trader of antique items in Gujarat until about 10 years ago, then started writing about Modi after the 2002 religious riots. His books have gone into a fourth reprint after a spurt in interest in them, Shah said.
"I thought he was being wronged," said Vasu. "That is why I chose to write about what Modi did during the Godhra accident and how much he supported the special investigation team that looked into the matter," said the writer, who is also busy with Gujarati translations of the Chicken Soup series.
The election results have given a fresh lease of life to Common Man Narendra Modi, said author Kishore Makwana , who first met Modi in 1983 at an RSS shakha near Ahmedabad. An RSS member and author, Makwana said he chose to write on Modi because he had seen the man from close quarters and wanted the world to know the simple, unknown aspects of the man. "Not many people know his love for Bengali music. He is so fluent in Marathi that he translates his Gujarati books into the language himself."
Makwana said what interested publishers was an old interview of Modi where he talks about his interests, especially his love for photography. "After he came back from a Kailash Mansorovar Yatra in 1989, there was an exhibition of his photos in Ahmedabad." Former bodyguard Prabir Mahanti's Modi aur Mein looks at his working style and his attitude towards others. Mahanti was an assistant commandant in the National Security Guard and part of Modi's security detail in 2006 and 2007.
Not all the books are doing too well though. The bookshop at the BJP office on Ashoka Road in Delhi has 180 books on Modi in different languages but the biggest seller is LK Advani's My Country, My Life.
"The Accidental Prime Minister (on Manmohan Singh by Sanjaya Baru) has done better than all these new Modi releases put together," said Anup Kumar of Faqir Chand and Sons , a Delhi-based bookseller and distributor. "We had to send back many of the copies as there was no demand." According to him, only three books on Modi - Narendra Modi: The Man, The Times by Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, The Namo Story, A Political Life by Kingshuk Nag and Narendra Modi: A Political Biography by Andy Marino - have sold well.
RTI activist Vivek Garg , who has written two books on Modi, said copies of his works were even shipped to Islamabad as there was demand for them. "The books may not be selling like hot cakes but they are still moving. Given that Modiji is dynamic figure who will remain a topic of interest for many years now, we need books that explain how he will change India."

Fliers face trouble at airport as ground handling staff go on strike#ground handling staff #strike #fliers #baggage
New Delhi: A section of ground handling staff of AISATS has gone on a strike demanding salary hike and reinstatement of one of their colleagues,causing inconvenience to fliers as delivery of baggage to them was delayed.
The strike started due to which airlines who have taken services of AISATS were facing problems in timely loading and unloading of baggage and delivery of luggage to passengers, an airline official at the airport said.
Among the worst affected was Air India, whose baggage handling is done by AISATS.
Ground handling staff of AISATS has gone on a strike demanding salary hike and reinstatement of one of their colleagues.
"We have deployed some of our staff to tackle the situation, but as the number of baggage is large we are finding it difficult to handle the situation," the official said.
The employees went on strike after one of their colleagues was suspended by the management over alleged under-performance.
The employees are demanding immediate reinstatement of their colleague and also a hike in their salary.
Meanwhile, AISATS in a statement said it was unable to meet the "unjust" demands of the employees and requested them to return to work.
"At AISATS, our employees' interests are of paramount importance and our endeavour has always been to work together with our employees towards achieving mutual growth.
However, we cannot comply with unjust demands, and therefore request our employees to resume their duties immediately to avoid any further inconvenience to passengers," the statement said.
"In the interim, we have put into place adequate contingency measures to ensure the continued operations of all airline handling services and thus minimise disruption," it added.

Iraq premier says France to join airstrikes effortIraqi President Fouad Massoum, second left, welcomes his French counterpart Francois Hollande, center, at the presidential palace in Baghdad on Friday. (Source: AP)
Associated Press | Baghdad | Posted: September 12, 2014 6:57 pm | Updated: September 12, 2014 7:02 pm
France will join the U.S.-led airstrikes targeting extremists in Iraq as part of an expanding international effort to combat the Islamic State group, Iraq’s new prime minister said after talks with the French president on Friday.
Haider al-Abadi’s remarks came after talks with Francois Hollande, who was in Baghdad to bolster Iraq’s new government as it struggles to unite the nation amid the rampage by the Islamic State group.
“In order to confront Daesh, we need aerial support from our allies,” al-Abadi said, referring to the group by its Arabic acronym. “The French president promised me today that France will participate in this effort, hitting the positions of the terrorists in Iraq.”
Al-Abadi spoke at a joint press conference with Hollande in Baghdad. Neither of the two leaders provided details about when the French could join the aerial campaign.
Hollande added that France has delivered four arms shipments and 60 metric tons (66 tons) of humanitarian equipment to Iraq.
Hollande’s trip, and a conference that Paris is hosting Monday on Iraq, are the first steps in a long-term effort against Islamic State militants who have captured large swaths of land straddling the Syria-Iraq border with the goal of establishing a self-styled caliphate.
Earlier Friday, at a press conference with Iraq’s President Fouad Massoum, Hollande said that the Islamic State group is waging a war on “all people who do not share their vision or ideas.”
The aim of the Paris conference, he said “is to coordinate the aid, the support (and) the actions to work for the unity of Iraq and against this terrorist group.”
The U.S. launched airstrikes and humanitarian aid missions on Aug. 8 to boost the efforts of waning Iraqi and Kurdish security forces. The airstrikes marked a significant shift in the U.S. strategy in Iraq, where the military fully withdrew in late 2011, after nearly a decade of war.
French airstrikes would likely start in coordination with the United States _ but would not include ground troops, a senior French official said on Thursday, speaking spoke on condition of anonymity according to government policy.
Hollande’s visit to Baghdad is the French president’s first visit to Iraq since the crisis escalated with the Islamic State group’s blitz and the fall of Iraq’s second-largest city, Mosul, in June.
Hollande has been one of the most militarily aggressive leaders in modern French history, sending troops to Mali and Central African Republic. France was the first European government to start arming Kurdish authorities against Islamic State militants last month.
This is in part because France fears violence on its own soil. Authorities are struggling to stop the flow of hundreds of French radicals who have joined extremists in Syria and Iraq and who could return to Europe to stage attacks. A Frenchman who went to Syria and held American journalists hostage is the chief suspect in a May continued…

Polling on for 3 Lok Sabha  33 assembly seats; high stakes for BJP in Uttar PradeshComments
Brisk voting was recorded in most of the 33 assembly seats and 3 Lok Sabha seats where bypolls were held on Saturday.
In Uttar Pradesh voting percentage was highest  in Mainpuri Lok Sabha constituency, which was vacated by Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh. Mulayam's grandnephew Tej Pratap Singh Yadav, 27, is contesting the seat on an SP ticket.
Among the voters was chief minister Akhilesh Yadav who landed in Saifai to cast his ballot.
Lack of enthusiasm was witnessed among the voters in the first two hours in all the constituencies, but slowly picked up later. By 3 pm around 44 % had cast their votes. Mild rains also affected the voter turnout.
The Mainpuri seat was held by SP, while all the eleven Assembly seats where voting is on were held by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
In West Bengal voting was brisk in Basirhat Dakshin while Chowringhee had lower voter turnout. Both the Left and the BJP accused the ruling TMC of terrorising voters, BJP's Basirhat candidate Samik Bhatatcharya said.
Over 62% polling was recorded in Basirhat Dakshin while nearly 40% voters exercised their franchise in Chowringhee  till 2 pm.
Voting was also brisk and peaceful in Telangana, Rajasthan and other states where bypolls are held.
Analysts are looking to see which way the wind blows in the bypolls spread across these nine states.
The results of two Lok Sabha seats — Vadodara which was vacated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Medak in Telangana was vacated by Telangana Rashtra Samithi chief and chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao — are unlikely to throw any surprises. But Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav’s prestige is at stake in his home turf Mainpuri, the third Lok Sabha seat.
The bypolls are being seen as an indicator of the popularity of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and opposition parties ahead of four assembly elections to be held this year.
They also pose a key question on the future of the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in Uttar Pradesh.
The BJP swept to power on the back of a so-called Modi wave this summer, but failed to maintain the momentum in last month’s by-elections in four states where it lost a majority of seats to the Congress party and its allies.
The BJP and its allies together won only eight of the 18 seats that went to the polls while the Congress and its allies won 10.
In the last Lok Sabha polls, a large number of OBCs and Dalits rallied behind the BJP across the Hindi belt. The shift dented the SP and BSP’s support base in the largest electoral state. The SP won just seven seats while Mayawati’s BSP drew a blank.
The grand alliance of the RJD-JDU-Congress could halt the BJP’s charge into this caste base. In the absence of such an alliance in Uttar Pradesh, any further losses may lead to an existential crisis for the two caste-based parties.
If the opposition parties — especially the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress in Rajasthan, Gujarat and Assam — can stop the BJP’s march, their claim about the Modi wave waning will receive a further boost.
With elections in Maharashtra and Haryana due next month, any by-election victory will also give the beleaguered Congress a fresh face saver after its humiliating Lok Sabha defeat.
But it may not be so easy for the opposition. Of the 33 seats, 11 are in Uttar Pradesh where the BJP swept 71 of 80 Lok Sabha seats.
In Gujarat and Rajasthan, where 13 assembly seats are up for grabs, the opposition could not even open its account in the general election.
Three seats are heading for the polls in Congress-ruled Assam where the BJP bagged 50% of Lok Sabha constituencies.
In West Bengal, the ruling Trinamool Congress will be desperate to win both seats as it wants to show that the Saradha scam has not hurt the party’s prospects.
For the BJP, a win or even a number two position in the results from Assam and Bengal will further cement its position as a fast emerging force, replacing traditional opposition parties like AGP and Left, respectively.
The by-elections in Chhattisgarh, Sikkim, Andhra and Tripura will test if the ruling parties can further consolidate their positions. Tripura is the only state where the Left is in power.

White House makes it official: US  at war  with ISprint
The White House declared on Friday the United States was at war with Islamic State radicals, seeking to rub out another semantic flap over its Syria policy.
In a series of television interviews, secretary of state John Kerry had appeared to be reluctant to term the expansion of US operations against IS in Iraq and Syria as "war".
But pressed to clear up doubts about how President Barack Obama sees the conflict, the White House and Pentagon left little doubt.
"The United States is at war with ISIL in the same way that we are at war with al Qaida and its al Qaida affiliates all around the globe," said White House spokesman Josh Earnest.
Pentagon spokesman rear admiral John Kirby said that the US was not fighting the last Iraq war and used similar language to Earnest.
"But make no mistake, we know we are at war with ISIL in the same way we're at war and continue to be at war with al Qaida and its affiliates," he said.
Obama is scheduled to be in Tampa, Florida on Wednesday to receive a briefing from top commanders at US central command, which oversees American forces in the Middle East.
In interviews on Thursday, as Kerry toured the Middle East building an anti-IS coalition, he was reluctant to use the term "war" in referring to the US campaign, telling people not to indulge in "war fever".
"We're engaged in a major counterterrorism operation, and it's going to be a long-term counterterrorism operation," Kerry told CBS News.
"I think 'war' is the wrong terminology and analogy but the fact is that we are engaged in a very significant global effort to curb terrorist activity," Kerry said.
'Different' from last war
The dispute over wording may seem trivial when American planes and drones have been pounding Islamic State targets in Iraq for weeks in more than 160 operations.
But it indicates the administration is skittish about using language that could alarm Americans weary of years of foreign conflict and who embraced Obama's vow to "end" the US wars in Afghanistan and Iraq during two presidential election campaigns.
"The first thing that's important for people to understand is the president has made clear how the strategy that he is pursuing in Iraq and Syria to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL is different than the strategy that was pursued in the previous Iraq War," said Earnest on Friday.
Obama's new strategy, announced in a prime-time televised address on Wednesday, expands US air strikes in Iraq against IS and envisages new action against the group in Syria.
In addition, Obama plans to train "moderate" Syrian rebels to take on IS and to reconstitute the Iraqi army, parts of which fled an IS blitzkreig across northern and western Iraq.
But he has insisted that there will be no deployments of US ground troops in the operation — especially none that would recall the vast US land armies that were targeted by insurgents in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The debate over the word "war" is only the latest verbal kerfuffle to hamper Obama's attempts to clarify his increasingly under-fire foreign policy.
Two weeks ago, the president sparked a political storm by admitting he did not "yet" have a strategy for combating IS in Syria after the beheading of two US journalists.
Critics also accused the administration of seeking to "manage" the problem of al Qaida rather than seeking to decimate it.
On Wednesday, Obama said that his goal was to "destroy" IS.

Hindu tradition of tolerance is showing strain  says top jurist Fali NarimanHindu tradition of tolerance is showing strain, says Fali Nariman
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, September 13, 2014

Eminent jurist Fali Nariman hit out at the Narendra Modi government on Friday calling it 'majoritarian', and also expressed the view that Hinduism is losing its tolerance.
Arguing that the ‘Hindu tradition of tolerance is showing strain’, he said, “My apprehension is Hinduism is changing its benign face because…it is believed and proudly proclaimed by a few ,and not contradicted by those at the top, that it is because of their faith and belief that Hindus have been now put in the driving seat of governance.”
Nariman made this remark at a routine annual lecture organised by the National Commission of Minorities. Sparks flew, as the eminent jurist, chosing to be "unpopular rather than untruthful", highlighted increasing instances of hate speech, and indicated that Commission was failing to discharge its responsibility.
Minister of Minority Affairs, Najma Heptullah, responded by respecting Nariman’s right to hold his views, but claimed that the government and Prime Minister Modi were committed to safeguarding the rights and liberty of all minorities.
 
In his lecture, Nariman said he "welcomed" but also "feared" the strong majoritarian government in power at the centre.
 
 Outlining the varied ways in which regimes dealt with minorities – either through forceful suppression and eradication, coercive or hostile toleration, voluntary or involuntary assimilation – Nariman highlighted that India’s founding fathers had chosen a liberal path, of "affirmative action for protection and preservation".
 
Yet, he said minorities were at "crossroads today" because "the body set up by parliament to protect minorities has omitted to take effective steps to protect them". He noted the almost daily "tirades" by individuals and groups against citizens belonging to a religious minority and agreed with the criticism that the government at the centre had done nothing to stop these tirades.
 
But saying governments will do what they do to advance their political interests, Nariman pointed to the role of the Commission. “The main task of the commission is protecting interests of the minorities. And how does one protect interests of a minority…who are on a daily basis lampooned and ridiculed and spoken against in derogatory language?”
He implored the NCM to use provisions of the law to initiate action against those indulging in hate speech. “A majoritarian government is elected and exists mainly on the vote of the majoritarian community..The Commission is an independent statutory body.”
 
Heptullah said that everyone had a right to have an opinion, and the right to like or dislike other people’s opinions. But she went out of her way to assure that the government was committed to minority interests. “There was even apprehension that if BJP came to power, if Modi became PM, the Ministry of Minority Affairs would be abolished. Nothing could be further from truth,” she said.
She said she had asked the PM what he would like her to do after taking charge, and Modi had told her to implement manifesto promises for minorities. “He also said with a lot of anguish that even after 60 years, Muslim community was deprived of basic rights of a citizen – these rights included education, shelter, security of a job, security of life.”
Modi, she said, had told her that it was her responsibility to create confidence among minorities that the government cares for them as much as it cares for the minority. “This is my guiding principle.” The minister also referred to the Sachar committee report to underline the backwardness among Muslims.
 
Nariman was also critical of the judiciary and said earlier, the courts had shown special solicitude for minorities  regarded minority rights as preferred freedoms. “Minority rights are still regarded by the courts as fundamental rights, but, and I say this with regret, they are no longer regarded by the Judges of today as preferred freedoms.”  he said.

J-K floods: Golden Temple responds to Omars SOS  sends food packetsComments
Following a phone call from the Jammu and Kashmir chief minister to his Punjab counterpart, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) on Friday sent langar (food prepared in community kitchens of gurdwaras) for around 50,000 flood-affected people of Srinagar.
Omar Abdullah, J&K chief minister, had on Thursday made a telephonic request to Punjab CM Parkash Singh Badal, for the langar. He had asked Badal to request the SGPC authorities to send food for thousands of starving families of the flood-hit state.

The langar was sent from the Sri Guru Ram Dass Jee International Airport at Rajasansi by a regular flight of SpiceJet airways. SGPC sewadars were on board.
The food items were prepared by devotees at the Sri Guru Ram Das langar of the Golden Temple, gurdwara Ber Baba Buddhaji near Chabal (Amritsar) and gurdwaras in Khadoor Sahib, Goindwal Sahib and Tarn Taran. Devotees remained busy all night at these shrines, preparing the langar.

Confirming the dispatch, SGPC publicity in-charge Kulwinder Singh told HT that 25,000 food packets were prepared at the Golden Temple and other shrines. Each packet, wrapped in aluminium foil, contained four large-sized paranthas prepared in desi ghee, besides cooked vegetables such as potatoes and pickle. He said each packet had sufficient food to feed two persons.

“On Saturday, we will airlift 50,000 food packets, which will be prepared in various shrines in the night. This exercise will continue every day, with the number of packets likely to increase,” he added, referring to SGPC chief Avtar Singh Makkar’s statement that help to J&K flood victims would continue till the situation normalised.
The entire SGPC staff has decided to donate their two-day salary of the current month to the J&K government’s flood relief fund. Meanwhile, the Indian Air Force (IAF) has indicated that it might spare a cargo plane for the SGPC from Saturday onwards for airlifting relief material to Srinagar.
Currently, the gurdwara body is paying around Rs. 27 per kg for the transportation. More than 50 quintals (5,000 kg) of food was sent on Friday.
About 16 senior SGPC officials, including secretary Dalmegh Singh, are already in Srinagar.

Humans of Delhi go gaga over New York blogger Brandon Stanton'Humans of Delhi' go gaga over New York blogger Brandon Stanton

Photographer and blogger Brandon Stanton of the globally popular 'Humans of New York' blog and Facebook page was in Delhi on Friday and the humans of Delhi just couldn't get enough of him.

"For those of you in Delhi who want to say hello, I'll be in Central Park, Connaught Place at 6pm" — this post by Stanton on his Facebook page resulted in a crowd of more than a thousand people by 5pm.
Stanton, wearing a blue shirt, a colourful stole and an infectious smile, started by telling how he takes pictures of random strangers and gets them to tell him their incredible stories. "I always approach them from the front and take their permission before taking photographs," he said.
Brandon Stanton: The 'human of the world'
When he first started taking pictures of people in New York in 2010, he didn't always seek permission but does so know since the page and blog have become very popular.
Stanton is on a two-month world tour in partnership with the United Nations since August this year and has already visited Iraq, Jordan, Congo, Kenya, Uganda, South Sudan and Ukraine before arriving in India. His Indian sojourn began with a trip to Jammu, where his first click was that of a grandfather sitting on a cot with his grandson. The post says 'We are praying for the souls of our ancestors'.
Delhi was his next pit stop and he visited the India Gate lawns and then Central Park in Connaught Place.
As the crowd swelled, Stanton said he will take a group picture and asked everyone to gather for the photograph. It was then that a few Delhi Police personnel arrived at the spot, and started asking who he was and why a crowd had gathered. As they asked "Who is he with?", the crowd responded almost in unison — "He is with all of us!"
Post by Humans of New York .
Things went a little out of control from there as Stanton started running towards his car, and the crowd began running after him with many girls screaming "Brandon we love you!". The melee attracted even a larger number of onlookers who had no idea about what or who they were looking at.
"A fire has broken out in the Palika Bazaar," said a man in the crowd and soon people were looking over their shoulders to locate the smoke and the fire. Many in the crowd whipped out their mobile phones to take pictures of the 'celebrity' and mobbed the car Stanton had gotten into.
 "Arre bhai kaun aaya hai? Salman Khan hai kya? (Who is it? Is it Salman Khan?)," asked one, only to get this gem of an answer: "Bata rahe hain Bradman aaya hai (They are saying Bradman has come)."
There was unruly behaviour too as some men tried to grope girls in the crowd. Some miscreants were caught and beaten up on the spot. Finally, around 6.10pm, Stanton's car managed to move out.
'Thanks to all of you who came to the meet-up in Delhi. It went about as well as a spontaneous meet-up could possibly go. Amazingly, we were able to have a pretty organised, calm speech. Until the very end, of course, when we ran from the police', said Stanton's post in the Humans of New York Facebook page.

No effort will succeed in taking away the independence of judiciary  says Chief Justice of India R MLodhaPrint
R M Lodha made these observations while speaking on independent judiciary and corruption in judiciary at the Rule of Law Convention. (Source: Express archives)
Written by Utkarsh Anand | New Delhi | Posted: September 13, 2014 11:54 am | Updated: September 14, 2014 11:17 am
Although he chose not to comment on the government’s new law that proposes to scrap the collegium system for judges’ appointment, Chief Justice of India R M Lodha on Saturday said that judiciary’s “inherent strength” was capable of warding off attempts to tinker with its independence.
“I don’t intend to discuss about the Bills passed by Parliament but will speak about something dearest to me — independence of  judiciary . Justice Lodha said the people acknowledged that the judiciary was such an organ of the democracy whose institutional independence cannot be compromised with.
“I am sure and more than confident that independence of judiciary will be maintained at any cost by anyone and everyone to whom the judiciary is dear. It is the independence of the judiciary that leads to confidence in the mind of public that it will come to their aid and rescue if any wrong is committed by executive,” said the CJI.
Justice Lodha, who was speaking at a conclave organised by the Bar Association of India on the ‘Rule of Law’, said he was certain that a “strong rule of law” warranted an independent judiciary.
The CJI also spoke on corruption in the judiciary, and described it as the “worst form of ailment in the thriving democracy”. “As economy and industry grow, corruption also grows. With the growing corruption, it is very important that the judiciary is corruption-free.
It entails impunity if there is any amount of corruption in judiciary,” he said.
Justice Lodha  said the people should not do anything that encourages corruption in judiciary. “There are people who play all sorts of tricks on judges and are prepared to tempt judges and please those who man judiciary. We have to ensure that corruption is eradicated in all forms in judiciary,” he said. The CJI appealed to the lawyers to help guarantee purity in administration of justice system.
Also speaking at the function, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi praised the CJI for elevating two lawyers to the Bench as Supreme Court judges. Justices Rohinton F Nariman and U U Lalit — noted lawyers — were recently appointed as judges.
“I am grateful to the CJI for two appointments from the Bar to the Bench. This singular act is one of the most significant acts in the past 10-15 years and I hope that future CJIs will keep this tradition alive. This singular act by the CJI is closest to my heart,” said Rohatgi.
Notably, the two appointments, for which the government’s top law officer was thanking the CJI, were made by the collegium that is sought to be replaced by a new system of appointing judges wherein the executive is likely to have a better say.
Senior advocate Anil B Divan, K N Bhat, and BAI office bearers advocates Priya Hingorani and Prashant Kumar also spoke on the occasion, continued…
I can say with confidence that no effort will succeed in taking away the independence of judiciary

The Waiting Game: The least fun game of all#gaming #evolve #dying light #battlefield hardline
Anaheim: When it comes to video games, are they better late than never?
At this week's GameStop Expo, the video game retailer's annual consumer-centric event, more than 3,000 attendees had the chance to test drive highly anticipated titles like Evolve, Dying Light and Battlefield Hardline in the halls of the Anaheim Convention Center. However, it's probably the last time this year that gamers will be able to play those particular titles.
That's because they're among the growing list of games initially set to be released in 2014 that have been delayed until 2015. The publishers behind the monster fighter Evolve, zombie survival adventure Dying Light and cops-and-robbers romp Battlefield Hardline each postponed their release dates earlier this year so developers had more time to tweak the titles.
In this June 10, 2014 file photo, people stand next to a monster character from the video game "Evolve" as they watch gamers play the video game at the Electronic Entertainment Expo, in Los Angeles.  (AP Photo)
It's a frustrating trend that's prompting many players to bemoan the least fun game of all: The Waiting Game.
"Oh, it sucks," said Dan Adams, an expo attendee who came to preview games like Far Cry 4 and Call of Duty on the show floor. "I know games are delayed to make them better, but it definitely feels like it's happening more often these days. It really messes with your expectations when you think you know when a game is coming out, and then - boom - it's next year."
Other games previously set for release this year that have been pushed to 2015 include the online apocalyptic shooter Tom Clancy's The Division, the Dark Knight sequel Batman: Arkham Knight, the supernatural historical adventure The Order: 1886, the sprawling role-playing sequel The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and the open-world movie adaptation Mad Max.
"There are so many games for next year, it makes me worried sometimes," said Yves Guillemot, CEO of Ubisoft, at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in June. "We are always caught between two things: How can we make it better but take full advantage of what we started a few years ago? It's always a difficult decision because there are always other games coming."
Deciding to delay is as much a business decision as it is a creative one.
While setting a release date helps to build hype for a game, if it comes out on time but doesn't meet gamers' expectations, there's less chance a publisher will greenlight a sequel. Historically, consumers are forgiving of most overdue games. For instance, the fourth-month delay of last year's Grand Theft Auto V hardly seemed to impact sales.
That's likely to be true for the latest batch of tardy titles, which also aren't expected to affect the sales of the newer PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles. In fact, pushing games like Evolve to February 10 and Batman: Arkham Knight to June 5 might actually boost the bottom line for publishers like 2K Games and Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment.
"I don't think any of the delayed games are system sellers, so I don't really think it makes a lot of difference," said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Morgan. "The games coming out will benefit from lower competition, and the delays smooth out the release calendar, so they'll probably create an opportunity for greater success all around."
It also means newcomers like Evolve, The Order and Division won't have to compete with the latest editions of long-running series, such as military shooter Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, fantasy epic Dragon Age: Inquisition, shoot-'em-up Far Cry 4 and French Revolution-set Assassin's Creed: Unity. They're still on track to come out in 2014 - well, for now.
"It's still the best slate of games I've seen since I've been here, and I've been here nine years," said Tony Bartel, president of GameStop Corp. "There are plenty of genres. We think it's all going to come down to affordability. We're working on programs specifically around trades to put currency in the hands of our customers, so they can afford all of those games."

J&K floods: Insurers to speed up claims sett...Bajaj Allianz General Insurance
(Insurance companies led…)
MUMBAI: State-run life insurer LIC will take the lead in instant settlement of insurance claims in the flood-hit Jammu & Kashmir state after the local government requested them to do so to get life back to normal as the enormity of the situation could cripple the economy.
LIC India will set up camps in the flood-affected towns and villages and will clear the payments with the evidence of death certificate from the local authority and may not insist on insurance policy certificates or other requirements such as on-the-spot verification, said two people familiar with the development.
LIC may also waive off certain conditions to settle death claims of missing persons. "If a nominee is able to establish that the policyholder who is missing and is likely to be the victim of the flood, LIC will settle the claim," said a senior LIC official. As of now, LIC rules say that they need to wait for seven years before settling claims of a missing person.
Meanwhile, private insurers too are taking initiatives to help food victims in settling the claims. PNB Metlife, which became the second biggest insurer in the state because of its tie-up with the state's biggest bank Jammu & Kashmir Bank, will do so with minimum documentation. "The camps aim to ensure hassle-free claim settlement for the customers across the valley," said a PNB Metlife executive who did not want to be identified. "In view of the grim situation, the claim process has been simplified and requires minimal documentation."
The Himalayan state is facing its worst floods in decades with more than 200 feared killed and thousands stranded due to flooding of towns and cities.
The Jammu-Srinagar Highway , the state's arterial road is cut off for the ninth straight day making relief work difficult. Home minister Rajnath Singh termed it 'national calamity.'
LIC, which is the largest provider of life cover in the state, has issued 1.79 lakh policies for an aggregate sum of Rs 2,695 crore as of last fiscal year. Insurance companies led by LIC had taken similar initiatives to settle claims in the past during floods at Uttarakhand last year.
Meanwhile, state-run general insurance companies like New India Assurance and Oriental Insurance, which have a strong presence in north India, are also looking at expediting and simplifying claim process for those who have faced losses in their businesses.
Bajaj Allianz General Insurance has set up a dedicated helpline number for the J&K flood victims. The customers can reach out to the insurer through this number to register their claims or seek any claims-related assistance.
"We have proactively streamlined our claim settlement procedures and have created a special helpline number to ensure speedy financial relief to our customers. Our topmost priority is to keep in mind the sensitivities of our customer and make their claims process hassle-free," said Tapan Singhel, MD & CEO, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance.

Ebola: Obama to hold talks with medical expertsEbola: Obama to hold talks with medical experts

Washington, Sept 13:  
US President Barack Obama would travel to Atlanta next week to talk with leading medical experts on the deadly Ebola virus that has erupted from Africa, a presidential spokesperson has said.
“The President will travel to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to receive a briefing on the outbreak of the Ebola virus in West Africa, discuss the US response to that outbreak, and thank the scientists, doctors and healthcare workers who are helping those affected by the disease at home and around the world,” White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters yesterday.
Obama will also receive an update on the respiratory illness that’s been reported in several states across the Midwest, Earnest said.
The Pentagon had yesterday said that it will transport a 25-bed hospital to Liberia in western Africa to help in the fight against the deadly Ebola virus there.
Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby said that the Department of Defence has about $30-million programme funding approved for its Ebola response, which includes delivery of the hospital and pay for diagnostic equipment, supplies and training.
“We’ve also requested reprogramming for $500 million in this fiscal year’s Overseas Contingency [Operations] fund for humanitarian assistance that would include West Africa,” Kirby told reporters at his daily news conference.
“The US government will continue to play a role here in trying to address this crisis. As a part of that role, the Department of Defence has capabilities that might prove helpful. And we’re a part of that discussion right now,” Kirby said.

Saradha scam: Kunal Ghosh blaming TMC to save himself  says Mamata Banerjee#mamata banerjee #kunal ghosh #partha chatterjee #saradha scam
Kolkata: West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has denied any link of the Trinamool Congress to the Saradha chit fund scam even as party MP Kunal Ghosh has dragged state minister Partha Chatterjee into the scandal.
The Chief Minsiter said that Kunal Ghosh is saying whatever he wants to in order to save himself. "Kunal Ghosh is an accused lodged in jail. We have arrested him. To save himself, he is saying whatever he wants to. Where is the evidence? These chit fund companies were set up during the tenure of the Left and not in our regime," he said.
She also added that the TMC government passed strong anti-chit fund laws in the state but since the Centre has not approved them, the state is unable to bring them into action.
"We have returned money to 5 lakh Saradha investors. The CBI will return money to the remaining 7 lakhs. Trinamool Congress is the most transparent political party in the country. I don't need to depend on Saradha money, neither does my party but some people are blaming us. It's very unfortunate," she said.
Bannerjee also said that an alleged a conspiracy was on to kill her and lashed out at a section of the media charging that "a deliberate attempt is being made to control the government for vested interests in land and business. A conspiracy is on to kill even me. I won't be controlled by anybody but only by the masses," she said.
"A section of the media is carrying out a malicious campaign against me and my party. Earlier, there was a rule in media houses to judge what is right or wrong. Nowadays even if we send a rejoinder, they do not bother to publish it. Many chit fund companies have started their own media houses," she said.
"We are neither thieves nor dacoits. To shield the real culprits, lies are being spread against us and abuses are being hurled, there should be a limit to everything. I am still tolerating but that does not mean it is our weakness," Banerjee said.

Hundreds of AK rifles, INSAS rifles and SLR rifles, along with their ammunition, are still submerged at various places across the Kashmir Valley, so are bombs, hand grenades etc.
Some reports said 26 AK rifles from an army camp have been washed away in the floods. In the area of Gogji Bagh in uptown Srinagar, one of the worst hit parts of the Valley, about 400 personnel of a central paramilitary force had to leave their camp after gushing waters engulfed it last Sunday night.

DUSU polls witness Modi wave  BJP-affiliated ABVP wins all 4 seats#abvp #nsui #dusu polls #delhi university #congress #bjp
New Delhi: The Narendra Modi wave was witnessed in the Delhi University Student Union polls as the Bharatiya Janata Party affiliated Akhil Bharatiya Vidhyarti Parishad (ABVP) won all four seats on Saturday.
Mohit Nagar won the president post, Pravesh Malik - vice president, Ameet Sidhu - secretary and Ashutosh Mathur - joint secretary.
Over one lakh students were eligible to cast vote in the DUSU polls for the four crucial posts -- President, Vice President, Secretary and Joint Secretary.
Mohit Nagar won the president post, Pravesh Malik - vice president, Ameet Sidhu - secretary and Ashutosh Mathur - joint secretary.
Seven candidates each for the posts of President and Joint Secretary; six for the post of Vice President and eight nominees for the post of Secretary are in the poll fray.
Interestingly, Students' Federation of India (SFI), Arunachal Students' Federation (ASF) and All India Democratic Students Organisation (AIDSO) have come together this time to form an alliance called Left Students' Front (LSF).
Another new entry in the poll fray is Chanakya Parishad.
DUSU is the representative body of the students from most colleges and faculties of the varsity.
The polls have been keenly contested over decades and have also been a stepping stone to party politics for some prominent leaders.
Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, senior Congress leader Ajay Maken, Delhi BJP president Satish Upadhyay, BJP leader Vijay Goel are among the many national and state-level politicians who began their political career at DUSU.
Last year, the DUSU polls were swept by ABVP. While ABVP candidate Raju Rawat was elected as the joint secretary, Aman Awana and Utkarsh Chaudhary were elected as president and vice-president respectively.
The Congress-backed National Students' Union of India (NSUI) had managed to win only one seat with Karishma Thakur being elected as the secretary.

However, as they come to terms with what happened, their colleagues work almost round-the-clock to save marooned civilians and deliver relief material to those who refuse to come out of their submerged houses for fear of theft and looting.
“We start our operations to help the marooned people at 4 a.m. every day and halt at midnight. Between midnight and 4 AM, the boats are serviced,” said Subedar Honorary Lt. S.P. Singh of the 103 Engineers Regiment, which is based in Jalandhar and was rushed to Srinagar five days back to help in rescue and relief operations.
He, along with his colleagues Naik Nachitra Singh, Naik V.D. Bhonsle and Naik O.P. Patel, make rounds of various colonies of Rajbagh, Jawahar Nagar and Nowgam, in boats to ferry the marooned people as well as those evacuees who want to visit their homes.
“Our priority is to save children, women and unwell people,” he says, while estimating that their regiment must have rescued at least 10,000 people so far.
Major Ashish Sharma, leading their operations, says about 250-300 people are rescued every day by them.
Besides rescue, they are also engaged in delivering food, medicines and other essentials to people who are marooned but do not want to leave their houses.
Indian Air Force, on its part, has pressed into service 35 aircraft and equal number of helicopters to bring in relief supplies and evacuate people from the valley. These include heavy lift five C—130J and three C—17 aircraft, according to an IAF spokesman.
Relief material is brought from various places including Delhi and Chandigarh, and stranded people are taken to places where arrangements are made for their onward journey to their destinations, the spokesman said.
He said while initially the thrust was on rescuing people from marooned areas, now it has shifted to providing relief material.

Prefer L&T with two years view: Anand Tandon
Anand Tandon, Market Expert is of the view that oen may prefer Larsen and Toubro with a view of two years.
Post your opinion here
Taking Stock
Anand Tandon, Market Expert told CNBC-TV18, "In  Larsen and Toubro  (L&T) after the correction that it took because of the last result, it has come back but not as far as from where it has dropped. We have to be a little patient to assume that it will continue to grow from here. So, if you are looking at a two three years view, L&T is probably a good entry point; Rs 100 here or there doesn’t matter if you are looking at a two years timeframe."
" ICICI Bank has been somewhat of a consistent performer. Reliance Industries  in my view will have to lead the next rally though there are some negatives that are building up because of the GRM falling globally and the likely expectation that the refining margins will remain soft
for pretty much the next maybe a couple of years because of the new capacities coming on in refining," he said.
"However, there are several other triggers there. There is a trigger in terms of retail, finally the 4G has to take off at some stage and there will be some resolution in terms of the gas prices fairly soon. So, Reliance too has not done much to participate in the market right now and can provide the legs for the next leg up in terms of the market."

Domestic pharmaceutical company Lupin, said it inked an exclusive deal to market some of US firm Salix Pharmaceuticals' products in Canada to expand its footprint in that region.
Salix will get an upfront payment from Lupin, which is the country's fourth-largest drugmaker by sales, and is entitled to additional payments contingent on meeting some sales milestones, the Mumbai-based company said in a statement.
The domestic drug firm , whose largest market is the United States, has the option to sell other gastroenterology products in Salix's pipeline after approval by Candian regulators.
The deal includes Salix's Relistor injection for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation, and Zaxine for use in adults to help reduce risk of recurrence of overt hepatic encephalopathy - a disorder that causes worsening of brain function.
Lupin's shares closed 2.93 per cent higher at Rs 1359.25 per scrip at the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) on Friday.

New iPhone 6 Plus pre-order shipments delayed | Chinese ready to pay $2 500Many customers will have to wait three to four weeks to get their hands on Apple Inc's larger screen iPhone 6 Plus after pre-orders for Sept. 19 delivery were booked out within hours
ET SPECIAL:
ET Special: All you want to know about Apple iPhone 6
Customers may have to wait three to four weeks to get their hands on Apple Inc's iPhone 6 Plus, after a record number of orders for the company's latest smartphones strained available supply.
The new iPhone 6 goes on sale on Sept. 19 in the United States but the company began taking online orders on Thursday. While the larger 5.5-inch "Plus" models now display a wait time of up to a month, the 4.7-inch version remains available for delivery on September 19, Apple's website showed.
Verizon Wireless , AT&T and Sprint Corp , also showed shipment delays of up to six weeks on their respective websites. Apple said the pace of orders has so far outstripped any of its previous iPhones.
"Response to iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus has been incredible, with a record number of pre-orders overnight. Pre-orders are currently available online or through the Apple Store App," spokeswoman Trudy Muller said.
Apple routinely grapples with iPhone supply constraints, particularly in years that involve a smartphone re-design. The latest iPhones come with larger screens and some analysts had anticipated that production issues may keep a lid on initial runs.
Its suppliers had scrambled to get enough screens ready because the need to redesign a key component had disrupted panel production, supply chain sources told Reuters last month.
It was unclear whether the hiccup could limit the number of phones available to consumers, the sources said at the time. Apple declined to comment on supply chain issues.
In addition, Chinese customers may also have to wait until the year-end before they can buy the iPhone 6. Apple is yet to set a release date for China, the world's biggest smartphone market.
The company unveiled its latest iPhones along with a watch and a mobile payments service on Tuesday.
AT&T's chief executive of mobile and business, Ralph de la Vega, told investors at a conference in New York that iPhone 6 orders have so far surpassed orders last year and the year before.
"It is such a great thing to wake up in the morning to know that you have hundreds of thousands of orders already before you even have a cup of coffee," said the executive.
Apple's iPhones tend to incite the kind of initial buying frenzy unknown to many other brands, partly because of the company's well-honed marketing tactics.
On secondary markets online, the rights to a pre-ordered iPhone 6 Plus are worth as much as double the unsubsidized sticker price. One eBay auction for an unlocked 128-gigabyte gold version of the 5.5-inch phone, for example, was bidding at $1,625 on Friday afternoon, compared with a face value of $949.
One post on the New York City edition of Craigslist sought $10,000 the privilege to "be one of the first & few people to own this model and before the rest of the world."
New iPhones tend to get listed at stratospheric prices on various online retail sites from the United States to China, on the assumption that there's big demand from people who must get their hands on the phone from day one. That in turns fuels a grey market of dealers who buy in bulk for resale.

Indian pharmacologist charged with smuggling fakedrugsPress Trust of India | Washington | Posted: September 13, 2014 12:19 pm
An Indian pharmacologist and an American pharmacist have been charged with smuggling four million misbranded and counterfeit pharmaceuticals into the US, federal prosecutors said.
Indian Balbir Bhogal, 67, from Las Vegas, and Wisconsin-based pharmacist Marla Ahlgrimn, 59, were arraigned on an indictment on Friday in federal court in Central Islip, New York, before US Magistrate Judge Gary Brown.
In a 10-count indictment, the duo was charged with importing and distributing controlled substances and misbranded drugs, trafficking in counterfeit drugs, mail and wire fraud, smuggling and money laundering.
According to the indictment and information presented at the arraignment, from June 2007 to May 2010, Ahlgrimm and Bhogal, who allegedly arranged for the manufacture in India of millions of tablets of controlled substances, includingalprazolam and phentermine, and prescription drugs, including carisoprodol and counterfeit Viagra.
Although they did not hold an importer’s license from the Drug Enforcement Administration, the defendants allegedly arranged for the importation of the same drugs into the US.
Neither the incoming packages nor the tablets themselves were labelled or identified as controlled substances or prescription drugs, federal prosecutors alleged.
The drugs were allegedly intended to be supplied to an online pharmacy, based in Costa Rica that catered to customers within the US, including Brooklyn and Queens, New York.
The online pharmacy used call centres and websites based outside the US, but filled the orders from inside the US using individuals who were not licensed pharmacists to bottle, label and drop-ship the drugs.

ABVP bags all four posts in DUSU pollsprint
The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarathi Parishad (ABVP) swept the Delhi University Students' Union elections after 17 years. The last time the party was able to bag all positions - president, vice president, secretary and joint secretary - was in 1997.
The ecstatic party workers credited the 'Modi factor' and the rollback of the four-year undergraduate programme (FYUP) for the emphatic win.
"There is no denying that the Modi factor helped us. This, along with the fact that our party workers have engaged with the students continuously over the last one week on various issues, ensured our victory," said Mohit Nagar, who was elected the DUSU president.
Nagar won by a margin of over 900 votes, getting 20,718 votes in total. The highest winning margin was recorded for the post of Joint Secretary, which was won by Ashutosh Mathur by a margin of 11,068 votes.
The second highest win was for the position of the vice-president, won by Parvesh Malik by a margin of 7,859 votes.
ABVP was anticipating the win after it performed well in the college-level elections where its candidates won at least one position each in 21 colleges.
On Saturday, the counting started at around 8 am and the results were declared by 11.15 am.
ABVP members then proceeded to the Faculty of Arts where they had the customary victory march - winners climbing atop the Vivekananda Statue, shouting slogans and getting photographs clicked.
A customary fight also broke out during the victory march but, ironically, it was between two groups of ABVP itself.
On the winning party's agenda this year is a movement for a safe campus, more colleges and hostels in the university and safe transportation.
"We have been raising the issue of the campus being unsafe for women for a long time now. We will come out with a list of actions that can be taken to make it safer. We are also advocating the building of a campus in east and west Delhi so that interaction with the university becomes easier for the students in these colleges," said Rohit Chahal, national secretary, ABVP.
The party's win may mean more protests against the Delhi University administration, especially the vice-chancellor Dinesh Singh. ABVP was one of the parties that opposed FYUP and was instrumental in its rollback. The party has been demanding that Singh step down from his post.
The student party is also doing better than last year in Jawaharlal Nehru University. 11 candidates that the party supported had won the councillor seats. Counting on others was still on. In the science schools in the university they were ahead in all four panel posts at the time of going to press.

Balasore (Odisha), Sept 11:  
India today successfully test-fired its indigenously built nuclear capable Agni-I missile, which has a strike range of 700 km, from a test range off Odisha coast as part of a user trial by the Army.
The surface-to-surface, single-stage missile, powered by solid propellants, was test-fired from a mobile launcher at about 11.11 hrs from launch pad-4 of the Integrated Test Range (ITR) at Wheeler Island, about 100 km from here, Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) spokesman Ravi Kumar Gupta said.
Describing the trial as fully successful, Gupta said the ballistic missile was launched by the Strategic Forces Command (SFC) of the army as part of a training exercise.
“The entire exercise was conducted in a perfect manner and the trial was totally successful,” he said.
“The DRDO developed medium range ballistic missile from the production lot was launched as part of regular training exercise by the armed forces,” said another official.
Agni-I missile has a specialised navigation system which ensures it reaches the target with a high degree of accuracy and precision.
The missile, which has already been inducted in to Armed Forces has proved its excellent performance in terms of range, accuracy and lethality.
Weighing 12 tonnes, the 15-metre-long Agni-I, which can carry payloads up to 1,000 kg, has already been inducted into the Indian Army.
Agni—I was developed by advanced systems laboratory, the premier missile development laboratory of the DRDO in collaboration with Defence Research Development Laboratory and Research Centre Imarat and integrated by Bharat Dynamics Limited, Hyderabad.
The last trial of the Agni-I missile was successfully carried out on April 12, 2014 from the same base. It was first trial that was launched after sunset.

NASA  ISRO in talks to set up Joint Mars Working GroupNASA, ISRO in talks to set up Joint Mars Working Group
PTI
NASA
Washington, Sept 11:  
America’s premier space agency NASA and its Indian counterpart ISRO are talking about setting up a Joint Mars Working Group, a top US space official has said ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the US.
“NASA is in discussions with the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) regarding potential scientific collaboration with their Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), due to enter Mars' orbit about two days after MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) orbiter, which will arrive at Mars later this month,” said James Green Director, Planetary Science Division, Science Mission Directorate, NASA.
Testifying before the House of Representatives Subcommittee on Space Committee on Science, Space and Technology, he said while primarily a technology-demonstration mission, MOM includes five science instruments to study the Martian atmosphere, mineralogy and surface features.
“With multiple data sets being collected, NASA and ISRO scientists will have a wealth of information to help solve mysteries regarding the Mars atmosphere,” he said.
“In addition, NASA and ISRO are talking about setting up a Joint Mars Working Group, under the auspices of the State Department’s US—India Civil Space Joint Working Group, that would coordinate our two agencies’ plans for studying one of the Earth’s nearest neighbors,” Green said.
Both the missions of NASA and ISRO will arrive at the Red Planet just in time to join the fleet of Mars—based spacecraft that could witness the effects of comet Siding Spring, Green told lawmakers.
MAVEN, he said, will explore the Mars’ upper atmosphere, ionosphere and interactions with the sun and solar wind.
Scientists will use MAVEN data to determine the role that loss of volatiles from the Mars atmosphere to space has played through time, giving an insight into the history of Mars’ atmosphere and climate, liquid water, and planetary habitability, he added.
James F. Bell, president of The Planetary Society & Professor at Arizona State University, described NASA as the most active, most capable, and most successful of all of the world’s space agencies.
When NASA doesn’t prioritise planetary science, no other agencies are presently capable of filling the gap, he added.
The emergence of the Chinese and Indian space programmes and the continued successes of the European and Japanese programs illustrate that robotic exploration of space is an international priority – a way to gain scientific knowledge, global prestige and advance technological capability, he said.
“In the coming decade, China is preparing a series of robotic lunar missions, Russia is preparing lunar, Venus and Mars missions, India has plans to go to the Moon and Mars, Japan is planning a second asteroid sample-return mission, and the Europeans are headed to Mercury, Mars, the asteroids and Jupiter,” Bell said.

US stocks recovered from early losses on Thursday, with the S&P 500 managing a slight gain as energy prices and oil stocks turned higher and financials lent support.
The S&P energy index rose 0.1 percent, after trading down more than 1 percent earlier. Shares of Exxon Mobil, which had been down for much of the session, closed up 0.2 percent.
US crude oil futures CLc1 ended up 1.3 percent, while Brent was flat. US crude prices have lost roughly 3 percent so far this month while the S&P energy index is down 3.8 percent.
"You've got a fairly good rally back in oil, which has certainly helped some of the stocks tied to that," said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.
Weighing on the market earlier was data showing jobless claims unexpectedly rose, the second discouraging read on the labor market within a week.
The day's pause comes as investors debate whether equities have enough catalysts to push prices further upward, or whether a long-overdue correction may be around the corner.
One strategist, David Rosenberg of Canadian asset manager Gluskin Sheff, told Reuters on Thursday he thinks US stocks have entered a corrective phase but that the underlying bull market remains intact.
The S&P 500 had closed at a record high Friday and the index is up 8.1 percent for the year so far.
Financials also helped lift the market, with JPMorgan Chase, up 0.9 percent, and Bank of America up 1.3 percent, among the biggest positives for the S&P 500.
"Their valuations are still reasonable, and the concern some investors have is that some of the higher-valuation (stocks) won't be able to survive a rise in interest rates," Meckler said.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 19.71 points, or 0.12 percent, to 17,049, the S&P 500 gained 1.76 points, or 0.09 percent, to 1,997.45 and the Nasdaq Composite added 5.28 points, or 0.12 percent, to 4,591.81.
The largest percentage gainer on the New York Stock Exchange was Vail Resorts, which rose 11.70 percent. The largest percentage decliner was Brady, down 7.68 percent.
Among the most active stocks on the NYSE were Bank of America; AK Steel, up 3.30 percent at USD 9.38; and Sprint, up 6.83 percent to USD 6.57.
On the Nasdaq, Apple, up 0.4 percent to USD 101.43; Facebook, up 0.6 percent to USD 77.92; and JDS Uniphase, up 10.3 percent to USD 13.36, were among the most actively traded.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,720 to 1,324, for a 1.30-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,576 issues rose and 1,110 fell for a 1.42-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.
The broad S&P 500 index posted 16 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 70 new highs and 43 new lows.

Halftime Report
Oil prices above USD 70/barrel are not sustainable in the long term, says Fadel Gheit, Managing Director & Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co.
In an interview to CNBC-TV18, Gheit says crude oil prices cannot be trading much above their replacement cost. They have been inflated for quite some time, because the risk premium due to fear of potential supply disruption has increased.
Gheit says crude prices can fall to USD 90 or even below by December.
“I am very confident that the US will end up lifting the ban on oil exports and that will bring crude oil prices lower, at maybe USD 10 lower from current level,” Gheit says.

Strategic networking in the Indo-Pacificsummit
India’s ‘look-east’ policy is maturing, with diplomatic and political linkages built up with Asian forums providing the Modi government a foundation to establish overlapping non-formal networks based on strategic convergences. Outreach with Japan and Australia are the building blocks
Last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s diplomatic outreach covered two established democracies of the Asia-Pacific, Japan and Australia. The outcomes reflect the geostrategic shift from the Euro-Atlantic to the Indo-Pacific and together, the two engagements provide interesting insights into Mr. Modi’s foreign policy agenda and diplomatic style.
The personal chemistry between Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo¯ Abe and Mr. Modi was evident during Mr. Modi’s Japan visit. Extra time spent together in Kyoto — feeding the carp and at the tea ceremony — sent its own message and further cemented the personal rapport between the two leaders. They come from very different socio-economic backgrounds but their shared sense of “nationalism” and “destiny” has drawn them to discover strategic convergences in their respective world views.
Both believe in the “Asian century” and are convinced that Japan as a “normal state” and an economically resurgent India can, together, be a force of stability and prosperity in the region. This sentiment can nurture a potential defence relationship, which for the first time finds prominent mention in the Tokyo Declaration.
The erstwhile “strategic and global partnership” with Japan has been elevated to a “Special Strategic and Global Partnership,” but negotiators were unable to bridge differences on the civil nuclear cooperation agreement that has been on the table now for over two years. Clearly, notwithstanding personal chemistry at the top, diligent homework and deft domestic political management are necessary, in democratic societies, to change deeply ingrained mindsets.
Civil nuclear opening
Both sides are aware of the complexity of the negotiations, and for Japan (the only country to have suffered a nuclear attack), Hiroshima and Nagasaki remain vivid memories. So while it enjoys the security of a nuclear umbrella provided by the United States under a bilateral security treaty, it had taken a highly critical view of India’s nuclear tests. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which India cannot be a party to, remains an article of blind faith for Japan. Therefore, it was a breakthrough in 2011 when Japan agreed to open negotiations with us on civil nuclear cooperation. Yet, there is a long way to go, as three issues remain divisive. One, Japan would like India to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), while India’s position is that it will maintain a moratorium on testing. Two, India seeks to retain the right to reprocess spent fuel while providing assurances that this will only be under safeguards and for peaceful purposes, whereas Japan would like India to accept restrictions on its basic right to reprocess. Interestingly, Japan possesses a huge stockpile of reprocessed plutonium, more than 40 MT, of which three-fourths are stored in the United Kingdom and France. Third, Japan wants India to accept inspections over and above what India has agreed to with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), under “national flagging,” which India finds unacceptable. In short, India cannot accept more obligations than those negotiated in 2008 with the U.S., which provided for the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) waiver.
Out-of-the-box thinking
Therefore, some out-of-the-box thinking is needed to conclude the India-Japan agreement, which not only has significant symbolic value, but is also crucial because Japanese companies supply critical components, including the massive 400 MT special steel Reactor Pressure Vessels, for the Westinghouse, GE and Areva nuclear power plants.
“Notwithstanding personal chemistry at the top, diligent homework and deft domestic political management are necessary, in democratic societies, to change deeply ingrained mindsets”
One way would be to accelerate the process of India’s membership into the ad hoc export control regimes — NSG, Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), Australia Group, and the Wassenaar Arrangement, a reference to which has also been made in the Tokyo Declaration. Second, 2015 will be the 70th anniversary of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings and it is likely that Japan will want to mark this event. This will provide an opportunity for India, given its long-standing commitment to a nuclear-weapon-free world, to conceive of and launch a new disarmament initiative together with Japan. Such approaches can help create an environment conducive to concluding pending negotiations.
Shift with Australia
Coincidentally, the highlight of Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s visit to India was also the signing of the Civil Nuclear Cooperation Agreement, under negotiation since 2011. Once again, though Australia’s security is guaranteed by the U.S. nuclear umbrella, it has remained insensitive to India’s security concerns arising out of Chinese proliferation activity in Pakistan. In 1996, when India decided to withdraw from CTBT negotiations citing national security concerns, Australia flagrantly disregarded international law and took the lead in introducing a provision that made the CTBT entry into force contingent on India signing and ratifying it! In 1998, it was one of the most vociferous critics of India’s nuclear tests. Patient diplomacy and changing geopolitics in the region persuaded Australia to develop a better appreciation of India’s stabilising influence.
With a third of global uranium reserves, Australia exports nearly 7,000 MT of yellowcake annually. In 2008, it began exporting to China and in 2010, to Russia also. With India, our non-adherence to the NPT remained a stumbling block, especially with the Labor party, till Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard reversed the policy and opened the door for negotiations. While India’s requirements, at 1,000 MT annually, are modest and we also have supply arrangements with Canada, Mongolia, France and Kazakhstan, among others, the agreement with Australia has enormous symbolic value because of our vexed relationship on the whole nuclear non-proliferation issue.
Mr. Abbott’s statements about India — calling it “a model international citizen,” “a country that threatens no one and is a friend to many” and “the world’s emerging democratic superpower” — marks a change in Australian perceptions. Commercial aspects are relevant but need to be seen in perspective: Australia’s uranium exports earn $1 billion while its iron ore exports are estimated at over $60 billion! And given that Australia supported the NSG waiver for India in 2008, its inconsistent position of not permitting civilian nuclear cooperation with India was becoming more absurd. However, it was a change in Labor policy and adequate diplomatic homework that enabled Mr. Abbott to declare, when the agreement was signed, that “there exists a high level of trust between the two countries and Australia will be a reliable long term supplier for India’s uranium needs.”
So the shift with Australia has to be seen in strategic terms, with potential cooperation areas identified as counter-terrorism, cybersecurity, transnational crimes, disaster management and maritime security. New trilateral and quadrilateral dialogue platforms are being mentioned, involving both Japan and the U.S. A natural corollary to these dialogue platforms are joint maritime exercises.
New equations
In recent years, such exercises have led to Chinese concerns being aired; Mr. Modi’s visit to Tokyo was carefully monitored in Beijing not least because President Xi Jinping is expected next week. Official reaction was muted, but some media reports described an India-Japan strategic relationship as “a crazy fantasy generated by Tokyo’s anxiety of facing a rising China.”
Later this month, Mr. Modi will have his first meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama, where, in addition to the Asia-Pacific, the nuclear issue will come into focus. The U.S. played a crucial role getting India the NSG waiver in 2008, which cleared the way for negotiations with France, the U.S. and Russia for the next generation of Light Water Reactors and enabled uranium fuel imports that have improved efficiency in our indigenous Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors to above 80 per cent. After the Nuclear Liability Law in 2010, negotiations with foreign suppliers hit a roadblock. However, even domestic suppliers have similar concerns that are impacting indigenous expansion plans.
The ratification of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Additional Protocol within a month of taking charge indicated that the Modi government considered nuclear power expansion an integral part of long-term energy security. However, forward movement will depend on resolving the dilemmas created by our liability laws and addressing supplier concerns in a transparent and legally tenable manner.
The “look-east” policy launched by Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao in 1992 is maturing. Diplomatic and political linkages built up with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as a dialogue partner, as part of platforms such as the ASEAN Regional Forum, East Asia Summit and ASEAN Defence Ministers’ (plus) Meeting provide the Modi government a good foundation to establish overlapping non-formal networks based on strategic convergences. Outreach with Japan and Australia are vital building blocks; new equations need to be built with Indonesia and Vietnam, while Singapore will remain the tested friend and sounding board for the Modi government as it gears up for the Prime Minister’s meetings with Mr. Xi and Mr. Obama, followed by the East Asia Summit in Myanmar and the G20 summit in Brisbane, and coupled now with the return bilateral visit to Australia.

Coal scam: CBI pulled up over hurry in filing closure report against K.M. Birlacourt administration
CBI tells special court that original minutes of the screening committee meeting, in which Birla-owned Hindalco’s application was dealt with, were "missing".
A special court on Friday asked the CBI as to what was the “hurry” in filing a closure report in the coal blocks allocation case in which it had earlier lodged an FIR against top industrialist Kumar Mangalam Birla and others.
“What was the hurry to close this case,” special CBI judge Bharat Parashar asked the agency’s investigating officer.
During the hearing, the IO told the court that original minutes of the screening committee meeting, in which Birla-owned Hindalco’s application seeking coal blocks allocation was dealt with, were “missing”.
To this, the court asked the IO to show if there was any statement which says that the original minutes of the meeting of the screening committee were missing.
“No such statement of anyone is there that the original minutes are missing,” the judge said.
As the IO was unable to give an explanation to the queries of the court, the judge directed him to call his supervisory officer in the court.
The court also pulled up the CBI for not bringing the case diary.
“On what basis you (the CBI) have drawn such conclusion (to close the case)? What kind of investigation you have done? What was the supervisory officer doing? Bring the police file and call your supervisory officer in the court now,” the judge told the IO.
During the arguments, the court also hauled up the CBI for “dumping” illegible documents before it, saying that some of the papers filed along with the final reports were blank.
“They (CBI) are dumping illegible documents in the court like anything... I am not able to read the documents,” the judge said.
The court had earlier asked the CBI to clarify whether “rule of law” was followed in allocation of coal blocks to Birla’s Hindalco.
The court was hearing the closure report filed by the CBI in its FIR lodged against Mr. Birla, former coal secretary P.C. Parakh and others.
The court had earlier asked the agency, “You (the CBI) have to clarify three things. First, whether the rule of law was followed or not? Second is whether there was an act of omission or commission in it and the last one is whether the act of omission or commission, if any, has an element of criminality?”
The CBI had on August 28, 2014 filed the closure report in the case in which it had earlier lodged an FIR against Mr. Birla, Mr. Parakh and others in one of the coal blocks allocation scam cases.
The FIR against Mr. Birla, Mr. Parakh and others was registered in October last year by the CBI which had alleged that Mr. Parakh had reversed his decision to reject coal block allocation to Hindalco within months “without any valid basis or change in circumstances” and shown “undue favours”.
The FIR related to allocation of Talabira II and III coal blocks in 2005 and the CBI had booked Mr. Birla, Mr. Parakh and other officials of Hindalco under various IPC sections, including criminal conspiracy and criminal misconduct on the part of government officials.
During the investigation, the CBI, however, had found that there was no quid pro quo on the part of Mr. Parakh and there was no wrongdoing in allocation of coal blocks to Hindalco.

HDFC Bank to grow 30% if economy expands at 7%: Aditya PuriProbably RBI realised that if the rest of the world is not senile till 70, bankers could probably keep their sense till then.
Aditya Puri
Managing Director
HDFC Bank
Aditya Puri would certainly be a happy man after the Reserve Bank of India raised the age limit for private bank chiefs to retire to 70. But more so, investors would be the happiest as there has been no denying that HDFC Bank  could report 25 percent growth for the past 80 quarters, since its existence, largely due to its architect.
Discussing the RBI move, HDFC Bank Managing Director Aditya Puri said that probably the central bank has realised that even bankers can work till 70.
The RBI’s move is in line with the new Companies Act, which allows all directors and managing directors to serve up to 70 years.
On Foreign Investment Promotion Board’s (FIPB) insistence that HDFC ’s stake in the bank is a foreign investment, Puri said he expects clarity on the matter in a month or so.
While the bank has grown at 25 percent for the past around 76 quarters, growth in the last four quarters has come down towards 20 percent. However, Puri is affirmative that he will get back to 25 percent and even 30 percent growth when the economy gets back to 6-7 percent growth, which he expects by FY16.
He said it is dangerous for the banks to grow fast when the economy is slowing as it can result in higher non-performing loans.
Below is the transcript of Aditya Puri’s interview with CNBC-TV18’s Latha Venkatesh
Q: The RBI has raised the upper age limit for retirement for the managing directors to 70 years. First up why did they do it? I have got three options, you tell me which. One, Raghuram Rajan knows that banking talent is scarce and whatever is there should be conserved; B, Mr Aditya Puri has clout and C, a bit of both?
A: You can eliminate B, they probably did it because they realised that if the rest of the world is not senile till 70 the bankers could probably keep their sense till then.
Q: That clearly gives you another six years. I will call it the last innings just because that makes it all the more important. You have done 20 percent growth for 80 quarters why will be different in the last innings?
A: This is actually a very exciting time for us. What has happened if you see when we have been talking over a period, in the last 3-4 years we have gone to semi urban and rural India. That is where 60 percent of India lives and that is where organised finance is actually not penetrated at all.
The second part is when you see what has happened to both the advertising world and to Big Data and technology, you have a situation where you have multiplicity of channels, you have multiplicity of distribution channels for companies, multiplicity of customer segments which makes traditional brand building very difficult. However what it also does if you analyse Big Data very well is, it gives you the ability to give the right product to the right person at the right time.
The third is what we are doing in terms of our CSR, where we have brought 3 million families from below the poverty line to above the line. Three million families, 5 to a family that is a lot of people. We intend to take this to 10 million. A combination of this is not only going to make money for the shareholders but it is personally gratifying to substitute the money lender, to go in and deal at the cutting edge of technology and to deal with the bottom of pyramid at the same time.
Q: Is Jan Dhan Yojna also applicable to private sector banks?
A: Yes absolutely.
Q: So, you mandatorily will have to open a set number of accounts...
A: We have villages allocated to us and in those villages we will be the ones opening the account and considering we have neither government ownership nor government business this is from the goodness of our heart.
Q: Is it goodness or will it be beneficial at all? This is a very genuine problem because  very senior, responsible and equally committed bankers like you told us that RBI's previous thrust, they opened something like 10 million accounts of which probably 3 transactions got done in the whole year per account. The point is that no frills account or the basic accounts are not getting used. Will it be any different in the next 6 years?
A: If it is going to be different. It will be different in the next 6 months and if it is not then it is not going to be any different in the next 6 years. The point is very simple unless the government follows through and ensures that the direct benefit transfer and other subsidies is made into this account number one so that they have balances and we are also able to build credit history.
Two, the government is saving a lot of money and I think they should be gracious enough to pass some of that to the banks because we are commercial organisations. I think this time they are looking very carefully and they will ensure at least that’s what they have assured us that they will ensure direct benefit transfer. They will ensure that Aadhaar seeding is done as it is really lagging behind. So, Aadhaar seeding has to be done and then we have to match the records with the government and money has to be paid there then you can look at further inclusion in terms of providing an overdraft dependent upon how much money he is regularly getting from the customer.
Q: You have been assured that some 2 percent commission...
A: But we were assured that previously as well and it did not happen.
Q: I took one case study on previous Indianomics show, united Andhra Pradesh was most advanced in terms of Aadhaar seeding. They had 8 crore Aadhaar cards. Practically the entire state was covered.
A: They shifted to the post office.
Q: Then how are you so sure?
A: I am not sure, I am just hoping. Rajasthan has its own scheme. So, the state governments and the Centre have to be in sync, Aadhaar has to be there and they have to ensure that we get the direct benefit transfer otherwise there is no other source of funds.
Q: Do you think payment bank will be able to achieve at least in urban areas and semi rural areas what probably basic accounts won't?
A: I am not quite sure I think we need a clear definition for everybody to understand what a payment bank is. Everybody goes back to M-Pesa, which is only a payment mechanism and not an account. The moment you talk of a payment bank the telcos will have to set up all the infrastructure of a bank. Then they will get deposits. The issue is after that are they going to lend? No.
So, financial inclusion is only the first step is the opening of the account. One becomes financially included when you allow him sustainability, which is the next step.
Q: Their first response was that we will get more stickiness in our prepaid accounts so we will follow through at least because there will be benefit for the telecom business even if this one is not in itself paying. You don’t think that logic will work?
A: I think that is for the telcos to decide. They made a lot of noise. I haven’t seen a payment application in with the RBI as yet. I saw something in the paper that we want this concession, if those concessions are given to the banks we can even do equally if not better job.
Q: You never thought of tying up with anybody?
A: We did but it doesn’t work. The pie is not large enough for two people to share. Then each one is saying this is my customer and this is my customer. We actually came up with a joint plan on which we spent a lot of time with Vodafone three years back to launch a better version of M-Pesa which we did. I personally went and visited the villages. Then when we went to the second step we got into issues of sharing the money because the pie wasn't large enough.
Anyway we have done our bit, everybody will have a bank account. So, if they all have a bank account then what is the payment bank going to do?
Q: Let me come to another issue which of course the market wants to repeatedly hear about – the FIPB. Have you any assurance that they will grandfather the clause and allow you to have more FII investments, not treat HDFC as a foreign account. What is the way forward?
A: This is the new India now. You have to think differently. Grandfathering is only one of the options. If you want to promote FII and FDI into the country the plethora of rules that we have is so confusing and I hope somebody understands the logic behind. If FII is coming into our country why should there be any limit at all? They are investing money here under our rules and regulations without asking for management control, I frankly think there should be no limitations.
The little that I have discussed with various parties who would be involved in this decision seems to suggest that the general feeling is that we should have a far more liberal regime so that money comes in both FII and FDI. So, I am very hopeful that the end result that we want would be achieved whether it is through grandfathering, whether it is through a liberalisation of the policy I really don’t know.
Q: Do you think you will know one way or the other in a month, in two months?
A: I would say within that timeframe yes.
Q: What if it was negative?
A: I will do a simultaneous issue, one local, one overseas.
Q: Do you need capital now?
A: We don’t need it now but if the rate of growth increases and now Basel III is imposing more and more conditions we would may be need it in 9-12 months or 9-18 months depending upon the rate of growth. So, there is no immediate need. Our total capital adequacy is 16 percent plus and tier-I is 11 percent plus. So, we will need it at some stage, we are just being careful.
Q: I agree with you actually it is not 80 quarters of 20 percent growth it is 80 quarters of 25 percent plus growth but in the last four quarters you have come down towards 21 percent. Will the base be this kind of a showstopper or at least slow you down or do you think you will overcome even that? You overcame it for 20 years will you yet overcome it?
A: Our performance has not altered at all. When we were making 25 percent the GDP for the country was 7.5 percent. I assure you at 7.5 percent GDP growth rate we will make more than 25 percent but to expect me to make the same at 7.5 percent and 4.7 percent I think you would agree there is something a miss in the maths, right? So, the slowdown is because there is a general slowdown in the economy.
Even within that I could still press and make 25 percent but I don’t want to push the envelope because we have the capacity even this. We don’t have bad debts, we have expanded our distribution but we normally don’t like to push the envelope and try and force growth. So, our normal basis for growth is real GDP X 3 is what the system grows at and we gain market share of 4-6 percent. I assure you and anybody else who wants to hear that, that is intact.
Q: Many CEOs I speak to say the vibes are good but on the table I have nothing to tell you that I will grow faster next quarter.
A: I wouldn’t necessarily agree with that. Let us put it differently, if we step back nobody has a magic wand that it is going to happen overnight. So, say we were at 4.7 percent, we had low hanging fruits and we have lot of actions that have to be taken for the long run. If we take the low hanging fruit in terms of getting the stuck projects going, getting faster decision making, getting clearer policies, restricting expenditure and defining what is going to happen plus a stable rupee, I think that has happened. So, we have probably touched the bottom and we are recovering.
We expect this fiscal the growth to be around 5.5 percent. We really don’t expect new investment demand. There are some brownfields like the motorcycle guys expanding or the consumer durable guys expanding but we don’t really expect Greenfield investment for at least another 12 months because even with the changed sentiment and everybody being positive from the time you conceive a project to the time it hits GDP it is going to be 12-18 months.
So, next year we are seeing it around 6 percent and 7 percent or thereabouts only comes year after next.
Q: The latest RBI numbers for the sector itself is still 13.
A: They went down to 11.8 but I think 13 is about the normalised number. I think you will see pickup in credit growth every quarter but not a dramatic pickup.
Q: We are done with the worst you think?
A: I think so.
Q: What do you make of this wilful defaulter clause and the strengthening of hands of bankers? Will that be a great stick to wield and may be arm twist borrowers?
A: A combination of statement of intent by the governor as well as the ministry of finance that bankers money is to be returned is the first step which is great. They followed it up with action. RBI came up with the stressed asset I, stressed asset II basically sending a signal we are monitoring what you are doing and we want a) the banks to recognise problems faster and b) to resolve them faster. The third statement that nobody has a divine right to continue with the project, if he can't run it he has to move out and his equity is to be written off according to chapter 11, I think you are seeing that. So, you are seeing the wilful defaulter example. You are seeing people selling off their assets so that they can pay loans, you are seeing people accessing the capital markets so that they can pay. I would say we are seeing progress, we will probably need to tighten further because ultimately we need a much lower level of NPAs going forward and a clear understanding and a quicker resolution. I think they are determined to do that and that is a combination of change in procedures, law and faster action.
Q: What about market development itself? He certainly tried a lot in terms of market development in the 1-14 day term money market. Do you think all that is working easy in the right direction? Will we have a better yield curve some time soon?
A: Banks have more than one day money, they have 15 day money. But most of them only want to deal in the call market. So, he has been trying this 14 days, 30 days may be wants to extend it to 90 days but a large percentage is just the bank dealing with the RBI, within each other that dealing has not started. He will have to take a number of steps before it will reach but if you are talking about the debt market then we are a long way off from a debt market.
Q: What more pieces do you want, everybody has stated reiterated their allegiance to creating a bond market. I have heard it for 12 years but what is the piece that is missing?
A: I think it took Dr Reddy to tell me this in Hong Kong. The problem is the fiscal deficit of the government. If you take household savings at about 12 percent and invest it in financial assets, corporate at about 8-10 percent the fiscal deficit of centre and states combined is 10 percent. So, there is very little leftover. You add to that the fact that most of this gets tide in SLR which you will held and buy so there is no trading and so you can't have price discovery. Since 90 percent of the issuance is government securities they only issue 10 years. 75 percent is in 10 years, 15 securities have 90 percent, part of it is held to maturity and the government deficit is not reducing.
Now with the help of lower oil price hopefully greater divestment if we bring the fiscal deficit to 3 percent or below then I remember discussing with Dr Reddy at that point of time, there was a time actually that given the deposit growth there would not have been enough government securities. Add on top of that the key question Dr Reddy asked me, he said you have written all this mechanics about debt market but Mr Puri where is the investor? It is not as of there is money sloshing around. All surplus money, term money is being utilised whether it is insurance or pension or any other long term between the fiscal deficit and other instruments. An arbitrage free yield curve and a proper issuance of government securities and trading starts from that fiscal deficit.
Q: Do you think infra bonds will be some kind of a bridge?
A: Infra bond is very good. The RBI recognising that if you are not going have a bond market for two to three years and the banks are going to be financing infra why go round and round the mulberry bush creating IIFL and all those people and then the bank funding it. So they are basically saying we will allow you term money without statutory liquidity ratio (SLR), cash reserve ratio (CRR) so that the price is right.
Q: So you might get something of a bond market because ultimately people trust a bank issue, CD's have a better market than any other instrument.
A: So you will have a bond market. Instead of corporate bonds being 10 percent of the market they will become 15 percent of the market. However, unless you have an arbitrage free sovereign yield curve and from the yield curve you need to create the derivatives and the derivatives can't be created on a simple bond but one step at a time.
Q: Inflation, are you hopeful that now all the pieces are falling in place. Three, four years ago or for the past three, four years an onion or a tomato or one vegetable potato inflation could easily become a generalised food inflation and then a general inflation. It's happened four times and now the governor is insisting that I want fight and win this battle once and for all. You think the ingredients are in place that this time around we are all likely to win.  
A: I hope so. God has also helped us; Brent is down to sub USD 100 per barrel so that is going to be one help. However, this food one I am really not sure anybody knows what happens, it's just those two three months its picks up. So they are making all the efforts. The governor is in the right trajectory in saying we have got to lick it. If we don't lick it there is no point carrying on and coming up with other measures and saying this will be controlled. We have to have a clear idea. He has reached the 8 percent on consumer price index (CPI) and 6 percent on wholesale price index (WPI) and with just oil not going up you will probably reach 7 percent and then if food comes right you will reach the 6 percent.
Q: Would you agree with his position that we have to win this battle once and for all?  
A: I agree with both his positions, not only that we have to win this battle. I don't think the impediment to investment today is a 25 basis point cut in the policy rate. Interest rate is not the key, there are whole lot of other things which you are aware of, I can repeat them if you want but it will be waste of time. So, I agree with both his statements that it is not the impediment. In any case as of today we have got the call rate lower than the repo rate. So there is enough money in the market. So what are we talking about, why do we keep focusing again and again on interest rate, can we get our infrastructure, our environment, our coal and all of that sorted out and I assure you with a good governor who is respected all over the place, I just came back from London and Tokyo, the monetary policy is in good hands and is not the crucial part for the revival as yet.
Q: This infra bonds gave us the idea that HDFC could issue a lot of infra bonds if it became a bank like IDFC is expected to. You have said clearly that infra bonds makes it attractive. What should we assume, how many years must we wait before this giant can become one and actually become the biggest player in the country, which it needs to be?
A: This is not a new issue. We have always said that an HDFC, HDFC Bank merger makes sense from a business point of view. Are they regulatory constraints, yes. With the infra bond we have made progress but we haven’t solved all the problems. So a few more regulatory constraints on the static balance sheet of HDFC if that was exempted you would see it fast. At the moment it is not on the table.
Q: One of the fears of the investors that now that you are going to be there for another six years for sure actually the merger gets postponed because there are too many good men in the organisation and therefore merging probably somebody will not be around. Therefore actually extension of your tenure is seen as postponement of merger, good analysis?
A: Very bad analysis. Let us say there is place for all and even the place at the top – no issue. That is the least of the issues. We are very clear if it comes about how it will be run. Unfortunately we need some help and the day we get the help I assure you the hypothesis that you have drawn out that it was wrong will be proven.
Q: Do you definitely need changes in the law before the merger happens or do you think that you will have sufficient number of infra bonds?
A: We don’t need changes in the law, we just need RBI to give a few concessions.
Q: If IDFC happens and you know for a fact that IDFC got these concessions ….
A: Then we will look at it. If it makes sense we will do it.
Q: How would you rate the first year, what is the hit and what is the miss?
A: You want me to rate the governor? You must be joking. I respect Bimal Jalan and I will go by his judgement which was a 10.

An investment of about Rs 1 lakh crore will be made in Odisha in the next five years in petrochemicals and oil and gas sectors including strategic oil reserves, Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said today.
Odisha, proposed to be the gateway for energy in eastern India, would be one of the few states to have gas from three sources - imported LNG, domestic natural gas and Coal Bed Methane (CBM), said Pradhan, who discussed about the planned projects with Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik.
"About Rs 1 lakh crore worth of investment will be made in Odisha during coming five years in petrochemicals, oil and gas, pipelines, LNG, LPG terminals and strategic oil reserve," Pradhan told reporters here.
He said the 15 million tonne capacity oil refinery being set up by Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL) at Paradip at an investment of Rs 34,000 crore is nearing completion and is expected to be commissioned early next year.
Describing the refinery as the largest of its kind in the country, the Minister said it would refine all kinds of crude and produce petrol, diesel, LPG, propylene and ATF.
In order to maintain adequate stock of oil for emergency situations, Chandikhole area in the state has been identified for establishment of a strategic petroleum reserve, Pradhan said an amount of Rs 3,800 crore would be spent for the facility with 3.7 million metric tonne capacity, he said.
The underground project, to be taken up in 400 acre area, would be the largest reserve in the country which has three such facilities in Andhra and Karnataka, Pradhan said.
On the petrochemical complex and Petroleum, Chemicals and Petrochemical Investment Region (PCPIR) proposed at Paradip, he said it would take off very soon and stimulate a host of ancillary and downstream activities in the area.
IOCL would invest about Rs 3,150 crore for setting up a polypropylene unit in the region work for which is likely to start soon and completed in 2017. The feedstock would be used in a number of activities including furniture, packaging materials, container and medical disposables, he said.
Stating that Odisha would be the first state in eastern region to have an LNG terminal at Paradip, Pradhan said GAIL and Paradip Port Trust are discussing the project for which Rs 5,000 crore would be invested.
Similarly, Paradip area would also have a LPG terminal at a cost of Rs 2,500 crore, he said adding LPG connections in the state which stood at 28 per cent now would be raised up to the national average of 60 per cent soon.
A number of pipelines would also be laid through the state which include Paradip-Ranchi, Paradip-Haldia-Durgapur and Paradip-Visakhapatnam-Hyderabad.

Guest list case: CBI director files affidavit in apex courtGuest list case: CBI director files affidavit in apex court

New Delhi, Sept 12:  
CBI director Ranjit Sinha, who has come under scrutiny for allegedly entertaining the accused in 2G and coal scams at his official residence here, today filed his affidavit responding to allegations levelled against him in a sealed envelope before the Supreme Court.
The affidavit has been filed in compliance of the order of the apex court which had on September 8 directed him to respond to the averments made against him, holding that they were ‘serious’ in nature.
The court had asked the CBI director to file the affidavit, saying, “Whatever you want to tell us, tell us in black and white.”
The matter will be taken up for further hearing on September 15.
During the last hearing, the Bench had taken serious objection to Sinha’s reluctance to file an affidavit on merits of the allegations and had directed him to file his response on a plea for a direction to the Centre to take steps for his removal and for ordering an SIT probe against him for allegedly abusing his authority.
The Bench had taken on record a register of entry list/guest list at the CBI director’s residence which was handed over by advocate Prashant Bhushan in a sealed envelope.
Bhushan had submitted that some unknown persons had turned up at his residence and had given him the documents without revealing their identities.
He had pleaded before the court to take the documents on record in safe custody as these may be destroyed.
The Bench had also taken on record a list of 23 ITBP officials and four CBI constables, who were manning the gate of the director’s residence at 2, Janpath here.
Bhushan, counsel for NGO, Centre for Public Interest Litigation, has alleged that several accused and officials of accused companies in the 2G scam and other cases have been frequent visitors to Sinha’s residence.
He has also alleged that Sinha was trying to protect some accused and has sought his removal from the post.

Marico reorganising business  aims to double turnover in four yearsViveat Susan Pinto |  Mumbai Sep 13, 2014

Marico reorganising business, aims to double turnover in four years
Rejig meant to drive synergies across markets and push organic growth
Six months after being elevated to the managing director at the Rs 4,676-crore Marico, Saugata Gupta is undertaking a reorganisation of the business to double the turnover in four years. The reorganisation, One Marico, is meant to drive synergies across markets and ensure the maker of Parachute and Saffola, with operations in Asia, Africa and West Asia, grows at an annual rate of 15-20 per cent.
"Our energies will be devoted to driving organic growth in our core markets, while inorganic growth will act as a top-up. Last year, we integrated the India and international businesses in our drive to consolidate operations. To achieve the next level, we are now synergising how we do business in terms of cross-pollination of brands and offerings, talent mobility, and transfer of best practices, processes and systems so we are more standardised in those respects across markets," Gupta, 47, told Business Standard.
ONE MARICO
After integrating its domestic and global businesses last year, Marico is driving synergies between the two to grow organically
Three areas have been identified for growth: Skin and hair nourishment and male grooming
At an India level, the company is pushing for direct distribution and targeting chemists, cosmetic, food and kirana stores
The reorganisation will see Marico focus on three key areas, including skin and hair nourishment and male grooming. "We also have a coconut oil and foods business in India and Bangladesh and a foods business in Vietnam. Those will continue. But at a global level, it is skin and hair nourishment and male grooming that we will drive," said Gupta, who studied at the Indian Institute of Technology and the Indian Institute of Management and has been with Marico for a decade.
The company will also create regional hubs to grow its business and is expected to drive synergies of scale across its manufacturing units. Besides India, Marico has plants in Egypt, Vietnam, Bangladesh and South Africa. The last four locations will act as regional hubs for North Africa, Indo-China, Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, while Dubai will act as a hub for West Asia.
The company gets 75 per cent of its revenues from India.
The company is driving direct distribution aggressively in India as it aspires to push a broader range of its products into outlets. Marico directly reaches 900,000 outlets in India, which, Gupta said, would be increased over time.
"We directly and indirectly  reach 3.6 million outlets in the country. Two years ago, we were at 3.4 million outlets. While the jump may not be much, our emphasis is on improving our direct reach. The more you can reach stores directly, the wider is the assortment of products you can push depending on how the store is positioned," Gupta said.
Apart from kirana stores, the company is aggressively targeting chemists, cosmetics outlets and food stores to push its range in India. This emphasis is tied to Marico's larger aim of accelerating the pace of growth of value-added products led by brands Livon, Setwet and Zatak acquired from Reckitt Benckiser two years ago in a Rs 500-crore deal.

Protesters chase Javadekar at real estate meetingMansi Taneja |  New Delhi Sep 13, 2014

Protesters chase Javadekar at real estate meeting
Customers thronged the venue of a real estate conclave where developers, consultants, two cabinet ministers and government officials were discussing the housing shortage and others.
About 25 buyers with banners tried to meet the ministers.
The developer in question was Unitech, which, according to the protesters, did not deliver residential units in Unihomes (Sector-117, Noida), and Unitech Golf Country Club, much past the scheduled delivery. According to the protesters, there is no sign of possession anytime soon.
Protesters chased Prakash Javadekar, minister for environment, forests and climate change, and information & broadcasting, to his car on his way out. He asked them to write a letter.
The protesters failed to catch up with the minister of urban development, Venkaiah Naidu.
A buyer said Unitech had not given them any timeline on when their homes would be delivered.
The project, Unihomes, which offers affordable houses, was launched in 2009, while Unitech Golf Country Club was first launched in 2007 and then relaunched with certain modifications in 2009. The agreement talks of a delivery period of three years.
The buyers had to leave soon after, once the matter came to the notice of National Real Estate Development Council (the organiser of the event and a body under the Ministry of Housing & Urban Poverty Alleviation) officials.
When contacted, a Unitech spokesperson said: "We are in regular touch with our customers and keep updating them on the project's progress. There have been some delays due to certain regulatory issues being faced by most of the developers in Noida and are beyond the developer's control. This may be causing anxiety to some customers, but we can assure them that they are well protected with the penalty clause under which penalty will be paid to the home buyers for any delay, as per their allotment letter."
Of late, homebuyers' protests have become common in the realty sector thanks to social networking sites and increased awareness among consumers. The lack of a regulator in the sector has added to the problems.
Among others, DLF and Supertech have been at the receiving end as buyers of one of their projects protested against the way the construction was being done, flouting the rules.
Recently, the Supreme Court asked DLF to deposit Rs 630 crore, pending the outcome of a final order. The Competition Commission of India (CCI) had imposed a penalty of Rs 630 crore on DLF on a petition by buyers of one of its projects in Gurgaon, alleging unfair trade practices. Following this, DLF moved the apex court against the CCI order.
The Allahabad High Court had also recently ordered demolition of two towers in Supertech's Emerald Court in Noida on a petition by buyers alleging violation of building norms. Supertech has challenged the order in the Supreme Court.
These are not the only cases against developers. There are many such cases pending before the courts and CCI, which will come up for hearing in the coming months. Rising activism of aggrieved buyers across various platforms, including online, against the developers are mainly on issues related to delay in delivery, quality of construction, irregularities in project implementation, and departure from promised amenities.

Washington, Sept 13:  
A top American Senator has applauded the progress made in India-US relationship in the first 100 days of the Narendra Modi Government, which the lawmaker said would provide “new energy” and “important momentum” ahead of the Indian Prime Minister’s visit to America.
“I am pleased to see US and Indian leadership work together to make progress on concrete deliverables during these first 100 days,” Senator Mark Warner, co-chair of the bipartisan Senate India Caucus, said.
“By demonstrating that we can move beyond talk and actually get things done, we can provide new energy and important momentum to set the stage for Prime Minister Modi’s visit to the US later this month,” Warner said.
Early this week, the White House announced that US President Barack Obama would meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on September 29 and 30.
‘First 100 days’ plan
In May, Warner had laid out the “First 100 days” plan prior to the beginning of the new Modi Government.
It included recommendations for both the US and Indian governments.
In a statement, the Senator said he is pleased that both governments have made progress on seven of his recommended priorities to continue to improve and energise the bilateral relationship.
This includes Secretary of Defence Chuck Hagel, announcing that Frank Kendall, Under Secretary for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, would lead the US side of the Defence Trade and Technology Initiative. India is yet to announce his counterpart.

Melbourne, Sept 13:  
An Australian radio station, which aired a prank on an India-born nurse, who later took her life after the broadcast of the prank, has donated USD 550,000 to her family to help them rebuild their lives.
Southern Cross Austereo said it was donating the money to a trust fund for Jacintha Saldanha’s family.
“We do not assume, of course, that this donation or any amount of money could relieve the feelings of loss felt by Ms Saldanha’s family. But it is our hope that it may help them,” a spokesperson said in a statement.
Saldanha, originally from Mangalore in Karnataka, was found dead in the nursing accommodation of King Edward VII hospital days after staff were tricked into revealing the details of Kate Middleton’s first pregnancy to two Australian radio DJs — Greig and Michael Christian — posing as Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles back in December 2012.
The 46-year-old mother of two had answered the call and transferred it on to the duty nurse on the Duchess of Cambridge’s ward.
Saldanha later wrote to the nurse, who had been looking after the Duchess on the night of the prank, to apologise for putting the call through to her.
An inquest into her death yesterday concluded that Saldanha had committed suicide.
The radio station conveyed its condolences but did not accept any blame for her death, The Australian reported.
“We also note that the coroner has said there is no causation as a matter of law between the hoax call and any subsequent voluntary action by Ms Saldanha,” a spokesperson said.
Radio programmes were collaborative and no blame could be placed on the radio hosts as “they are not the final decision makers”, although Southern Cross Austereo accepted full responsibility for the call and broadcast, she said.

Not acche din  but weeping times have come for India: Mamata Banerjee#trinamool congress #mamata banerjee #narendra modi #prime minister #acche din
Kolkata: Mocking Prime Minister Narendra Modi's "acche din" slogan, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said "weeping time" has come for people as resources of the country are being sold to foreign powers in the name of FDI by the BJP-led government at the Centre.
"Before coming to power, there were slogans like "acche din" (good times) are ahead. Now it seems weeping time has come for the people of India. In 100 days, there are 100 failures," Banerjee said in an interview to a local TV channel.
"In the name of FDI, they have opened up railways, defence and many other sectors for FDI. We are against FDI and in favour of PPP. There should be a proper policy. I am not in favour of taking away jobs of the common man. Fuel prices are going up everyday.
Mamata Banerjee said "weeping time" has come for people as resources are being sold to foreign powers in the name of FDI by Modi.
"Their (BJP government's) arrogance in power is touching the sky. Some leaders are coming to Bengal from other states just to spread canards and foment tension," she said.
Banerjee also criticised Modi's recent foreign trips.
"Out of 100 days, 90 days have been spent in foreign trips. He (Modi) is beating his own drums. We don't believe in publicity but he is more into that kind of thing. One thing should be remembered that this is India and you have to move with everyone," said the Trinamool Congress supremo.
"We have to move unitedly. Those who talk of religion should know that in Bhagwad Gita it is written that unity means religion differentiation is against humanity and not religious," Banerjee added.

Odisha: BJD under scanner over 20 000 cr chit fund scam  advocate general resigns over allegations#odisha #bjd #ashok mohanty #cbi #naveen patnaik #chit fund scam
Bhubaneswar: The ruling BJD is under the scanner over the 20,000 crore chit fund scam in Odisha. State Advocate General Ashok Mohanty has resigned from his post after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) summoned him in the case.
Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik has accepted Mohanty's resignation about four months after he stepped down from his post on being summoned by the CBI. According to sources, he bought a luxurious house in Cuttack at minimum prices from a prime accused in the scam.
The Odisha crime branch had recommended action against about a dozen chit fund companies but the state government went ahead and signed MoUs with them for several projects.
Names of several BJD leaders including those linked to Odisha Chief Minister have come under the scanner in the chit fund scam that duped over one million people in the state. Fingers are also being pointed towards Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik for allegedly not just protecting the scamsters but promoting them in their illegal business.
Some photographs reveal that Ranjan Das, one of the prime accused in the Rs 20 thousand crore Odisha chit fund scam arrested by CBI, is helping senior BJD leaders - Kalpatru Das and Pravat Tripathy - file nomination papers of Naveen Patnaik for the party president election in January 2013. Ranjan allegedly also went to Naveen Patnaik's house to get his signature on the nomination papers.
However, the BJD is denying that Patnaik's link to the chit fund accused. "The two BJD leaders who are there in the picture might be  knowing Ranjan personally but how would Naveen Patnaik know about his presence during the nomination," Senior BJD minister Damodar Rout said.
In 2010, the Odisha crime branch had prepared a list of a dozen chit fund companies recommending action against them including those of Seashore and Artha Tatwa. But shockingly instead of taking action against such companies Odisha government signed MoUs with them for several Govt projects
The CM had also attended the inaugural function of a news channel owned by jailed key chit fund accused Prasant Das who is the owner of Seashore group.
"The CM was acting like the brand ambassador of the chit fund companies. So they were opposing the CBI enquiry. Now the role of all BJD leaders in the scam will be clear," Congress leader Srikant Jena said.
The CBI has so far interrogated and raided the houses of 2 BJD MLAs and one BJD MP. The leader of BJD in Rajya Sabha Kalpataru Das had to resign from his post on Thursday after his son and BJD MLA Pranab Balbantaray was interrogated by the CBI.
Chief minister Naveen Patnaik had handed over the chit fund scam case to the Odisha crime branch more than two years ago and during their investigation the crime branch did not even question a single politician. With the CBI taking over the case after Supreme Court's direction, within two months several politicians have been interrogated and the political nexus in the chit fund scam has been established. Quite clearly troubled days are ahead for Naveen Patnaik.

Polling going on absolutely peaceful in the presence of central armed forces for by-election to Chowringhee Assembly constituency in Kolkata on Saturday. Photo: Ashoke Chakrabarty
Kolkata, Sept 13:  
Voting today began on a brisk note for by-elections to three Lok Sabha and 33 Assembly constituencies spread across ten states, seen as a test for Narendra Modi Government’s popularity, especially as BJP braces for polls in two states next month.
Uttar Pradesh
Amid elaborate security arrangements, polling was being held in 11 Assembly seats and one Lok Sabha seat in Uttar Pradesh, where the stakes are high for BJP. Around nine per cent votes were cast in the first two hours, according to poll officials.
The election comes after the saffron party’s near-total sweep of the 80 seats in Lok Sabha polls just four months ago.
Eleven Assembly seats felt vacant after 10 BJP MLAs and one of its allies Apna Dal were elected to the Lok Sabha.
BJP chief Amit Shah also faces the challenge in UP bypolls as he was credited with the party’s stupendous success.
LS bypolls
The three Lok Sabha bypolls are in Vadodara (Gujarat), Mainpuri (Uttar Pradesh) and Medak (Telangana). Among the Assembly seats, nine in Gujarat, four in Rajasthan, two in West Bengal, five in northeastern states and one each in Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh are going to polls today.
Counting of votes is scheduled for September 16.
Retaining Mainpuri Lok Sabha seat, vacated by SP supremo Mualayam Singh Yadav who had won from two LS seats including Azamgarh, is a matter of prestige for his party. BSP and Congress have not fielded their candidates, leaving a straight contest between Tej Pratap Singh and BJP’s Shiv Singh Shakya.
The 11 Assembly seats in UP, whose outcome may be a pointer to which way the political wind is blowing in the run-up to 2017 Assembly polls, are Saharanpur Nagar, Noida, Thakurdwara, Bijnor, Nighasan, Balha, Sirathu, Rohaniya, Hamirpur, Charkhari and Lucknow East. All of these were vacated by BJP MLAs who won the Lok Sabha elections.
Vadodara LS seat
In Gujarat, Narendra Modi’s successor as Chief Minister Anandiben Patel faces her first big test in by-elections being held today for Vadodara LS seat, vacated by Modi, and in nine Assembly constituencies.
This is the first election in Gujarat in more than 12 years that BJP would be fighting without its star campaigner Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Bypolls in AP
Polling began on a swift note for the by-election to Medak Lok Sabha seat in Telangana and Nandigama (SC) Assembly seat in Andhra Pradesh.
By-election is being held in Medak as the Lok Sabha seat was vacated by Telangana Rashtra Samiti chief K Chandrasekhar Rao upon becoming Chief Minister of the newly-formed Telangana state.
Medak LS seat, once part of undivided Andhra Pradesh and now in Telangana, witnesses a triangular contest between ruling TRS, BJP, and Congress. The bypolls were necessitated as TRS chief and Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao vacated the seat.
On the other hand, TDP is trying hard to prove it won’t be easy to conquer its bastion Nandigama assembly in Krishna district where it is in a direct fight against Congress. The by-election was held due to the death of TDP MLA Tangirala Prabhakara Rao within days of his victory.
Voting was also underway in the lone insurgency-hit Antagarh assembly constituency in Chhattisgarh where only two candidates are in the fray.
West Bengal
In West Bengal, Chowringhee and Dakshin Bashirhat Assembly seats had been won by CPI(M) and Trinamool Congress for which the bypolls are a crucial test for Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s popularity.
Buyoed by its modest gains in Lok Sabha elections in West Bengal and relying on Modi’s charisma, BJP hopes to wrest the Bashirhat Dakshin seat from Trinamool and make its debut in the State Assembly.

Never said BJP should form Delhi government  says Sheila Dikshit#sheila dikshit #delhi #bjp #congress
New Delhi: Former Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit on Saturday defended herself saying that she never backed the Bharatiya Janata Party to form government in the national capital.
"I never said BJP should form Delhi government. All I said was that if they have numbers they should form the government," she said.
Sheila Dikshit had on Thursday stirred a controversy by saying that BJP should be given an opportunity to form government in Delhi as it will be good for the people.
"In a democracy, elected governments are always good as they represent the people. If BJP has reached such a situation that it can form government, it is good for Delhi," Dikshit had said.
The Delhi chief minister for 15 years has also ruled herself out of the race for power in Delhi. She said, "I rule myself out of Delhi completely. I am not interested. Let the young generation take over."
She also said that she was pressured to step down as Kerala governor. "The way a bureaucrat called me asking me to quit was not right. Governor is a constitutional position. I suggest that Parliament should come out with a law that when new government comes in, old governor should automatically resign. Look how they treated Kamla Beniwal. Why should transfers to North east be seen as punishment postings," Dikshit said.
She also defended former prime minister Manmohan Singh and slammed former CAG Vinod Rai for making stinging allegations against him in the 2G spectrum case. "No one has the right to blame him. Why didn't Vinod Rai raise it earlier," she questioned.

Well water in Goa beach villages has worms: Public Works Department Minister#well water #goan villages #public works department minister #worms
Panaji: Well water in tourism-oriented coastal Goan villages is so bad that it is infested with worms, Public Works Department Minister Sudin Dhavalikar said on Friday.
"In Calangute, if you put your hand in the water, germs cling on to your hands," said Dhavalikar, whose ministry is responsible for collection, treatment and water distribution across the state.
Calangute is one of the post popular beach villages in Goa known for its beach and nightlife.
Well water in tourism-oriented coastal Goan villages is so bad that it is infested with worms.
Dhavalikar also said that like in Calangute, well water in coastal areas was extremely polluted.
Dhavalikar told a press conference on Friday that pollution of the water table along the heavily populated, tourism-oriented coastline made it imperative to ensure that a Japan-government sponsored sewerage and water distribution project was speedily implemented.
The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)-funded project in Goa includes expansion and augmentation of three water treatment plants, which would cater to both the districts catering to a population of about 6.60 lakh.
While the state government was to provide for taxes, land charges and other costs, the loan was to be repaid over a period of 30 years.
The project worth Rs.1,000 crore plus, started in 2007, suffered several setbacks and has dragged for years, thanks to sloppy management and delays caused by bureaucrats and tentative political decision-making.
The minister also said that in the coming months Goa would be the first state in the country to implement online systems which facilitate electronic calculation, billing of water usage and payment of water dues.

China's industrial output rose 6.9 percent in August from a year earlier, well below market expectations, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Saturday.
Fixed-asset investment, an important driver of economic activity, grew 16.5 percent in the first eight months from the same period last year, also lower than forecast, it said.
Retail sales climbed 11.9 percent.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast industrial output to rise 8.8 percent and retail sales to rise 12.1 percent. Fixed-asset investment for the January-August period was seen up 16.9 percent.
Also read:  India's July IIP slips to 0.5%; Aug CPI cools mildly to 7.8%
Output grew 9.0 percent in July and retail sales 12.2 percent, with Jan-July fixed-asset investment up 17.0 percent from the same period a year earlier.
China's economy got off to a weak start this year as first-quarter growth cooled to an 18-month low of 7.4 percent. A raft of government stimulus measures pushed that up slightly to 7.5 percent in the second quarter, but recent data have suggested the economy may once again be losing momentum as a cooling property market weighs on other sectors.
The government has pledged to maintain targeted policy measures to help achieve its annual economic growth target of 7.5 percent.

July IIP slips to 0.5%; Aug CPI cools mildly to 7.8%
A CNBC-TV18 poll had estimated CPI to soften to 7.7 percent and IIP to fall to 1.7 percent.

06:00 pm
Moneycontrol Bureau
Industrial activity, as measured by the index of industrial production (IIP), slipped to 0.5 percent in the month of July, data released by the government showed, compared to 3.9 percent in the previous month (which was revised higher from 3.4 percent).
While consumer price index (CPI) for August came in at 7.8 percent against 7.96 percent in the previous month.
A CNBC-TV18 poll of economists had estimated CPI to soften to 7.7 percent and IIP to fall to 1.7 percent.
Experts believe July has not been a good month and it will still take a while before the industrial growth and manufacturing actually starts picking up. Soaring food inflation and vegetable inflation are being seen as the main culprit for such high inflation.
 
C Rangarajan, former chairman, PMEAC believes that industry should work towards a much lower CPI number for January 2015 otherwise it will be difficult to achieve the 6 percent inflation target in 2016.
 
However, he says, the pickup in monsoons may lower food prices as rabi and kharif plantations has not been affected much and that may reflect and  relax the food inflation by the end of October and November.  Also, fall in global crude prices may help moderate the fuel inflation in the coming months.
 
According to Gaurav Kapur, VP and senior economist, RBS, the CPI data was in-line with expectation, though IIP came closer to lower end of the range.
 
He believes the rise in consumer durables growth at -20.9 percent against -23.4 percent (MoM) is a positive sign reflecting a pick up in consumer confidence. The growth ion auto sector will also get reflected in the months ahead.
 
Will RBI hike/cut rates now?
 
Rangarajan expects the Reserve Bank of India to maintain a status quo in its upcoming monetary policy as a rate cut is ruled out at such high inflation level. Though softening in food inflation may change the course going ahead.
 
Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist and GM, Bank of Baroda expects the Reserve Bank to take a breather and hold rates.
 
”RBI will try to control inflation by January 2015 and we are in for prolong hold,” she adds. She does not expect a rate cut for the next 12 months and also shuns away the possibility of a rate hike anytime soon.
 
Echoing her view, Jayesh Mehta MD and Country Treasurer Bank of America also rules out any possibility of the central bank cutting rates in 2014. He believes a rate cut may be in offing but not before March 2015, by when a better picture of the India growth story will be visible.
 
However, rate hike, at this point in time, will be complete shocker, he concludes.
Within the monthly IIP data, growth in its respective components stood at:
- Intermediate Goods Growth At 2.6 percent vs 2.7 percent (MoM)
- Capital Goods Growth At -3.8 percent vs 23 percent (MoM)
- Electricity Sector Growth At 11.7 percent vs 15.7 percent (MoM)
- Basic Goods Growth At 7.6 percent vs 9 percent (MoM)
- Consumer Goods Growth At -7.4 percent vs -10 percent (MoM)
- Consumer Durables Growth At -20.9 percent vs -23.4 percent (MoM)
- Consumer Non-durables Growth At 2.9 percent vs 0.1 percent (MoM)
- Mining Sector Growth At 2.1 percent vs 4.3 percent (MoM)
- Manufacturing Sector Growth At -1 percent vs 1.8 percent (MoM)
While within inflation, the breakup included:
- Clothing, Footwear, Bedding Inflation At 8.53 percent vs 8.73 percent (MoM)
- Combined Fuel, Light Inflation At 4.15 percent vs 4.47 percent (MoM)
- Vegetable Price Inflation At 15.15 percent vs 16.88 percent (MoM)
- Rural Inflation At 8.35 percent vs 8.45 percent (MoM)
- Urban Inflation At 7.04 percent vs 7.42 percent (MoM)
- Food Inflation At 9.42 percent vs 9.36 percent (MoM)

In a veiled warning to the domestic auto sector, the Commerce Ministry today said it cannot continue providing protection to the industry while duty barriers are coming down all over the world.
"...we have to look at to what extent the present tariff protection to the auto sector is sustainable...we will have to question ourselves on the sustainability of a long-term tariff protection plan particularly in an environment where every country is bringing down tariffs," Commerce Secretary Rajeev Kher said here.
He was speaking at the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) annual convention.
India is protecting the domestic auto industry from overseas competition while signing free trade agreements with different nations and groups.
Kher said while negotiating trade agreements one has to keep in mind the overall interest of different sectors.
"We have consciously over the last several years by creating a tariff protection have nurtured the industry and I think the point has come when the automotive plan needs to look at to what extent we want to continue with that and how do we want to bring it down to some kind of global at par," he said.
The negotiations for a free trade agreement between India and the 27-nation European Union got stuck mainly because of duty reduction in the auto sector. EU demanded significant duty cut in the sector.
"When we look for a preferential trade relation, we clearly can't have a win-win all in our account...do not look for a relationship in a trade agreement where it will be one way flow," Kher said.
However, he assured the industry that the ministry would announce incentives to boost exports.
"In the foreign trade policy (FTP), the auto sector will receive export incentives. The assurance I want to give you is that the sector will remain a beneficiary of the incentive programme under the FTP," he said.
The FTP is expected to be announced early next month.

Coming soon: A slice of New Yorks landmark Times Square in MumbaiMumbai’s cultural centrepiece Kala Ghoda will soon mirror the magic of New York’s landmark Times Square with street acts, vibrant lights, film and cartoon characters and giant electronic billboards, the government said on Friday.
 
The tourism ministry is likely to kick off the project with an initial investment of Rs. 5 crore while the Maharashtra government will also pitch in to create the essential infrastructure and draw private funds.
 
South Mumbai’s Kala Ghoda is the financial capital’s arts district, ringed by museums, galleries, Gothic buildings and some of the city’s oldest cafes. It is named after a black stone statue of King Edward VII on horseback that was removed in 1965 and subsequently placed inside the Byculla zoo a few kilometres away. An arts festival held there every February is a smorgasbord of events.
 
“Kala Ghoda in Mumbai is best suited for the purpose of creating a hub of heritage and culture, mostly open air, as the equivalent of Times Square. The fundamental framework should be ready in a year,” said Shripad Naik, Union minister of state (independent charge) for tourism and culture.
 
Naik said the government is planning similar ventures in other cities, aimed at boosting tourism, with Varanasi likely to be next in line.
 
A 15-foot transparent flagpole – on which the Tricolour will be hoisted –lit from within, drinking water fountains, wide steps for people to sit on and high-resolution web or CCTV cameras to project tourists on giant screens and internet sites are some of the proposed features.
 
“For a city like Mumbai, umpteen ventures like this need to be developed. Once the hub is built, some calendar events should be created,” said Abhijeet Patil, president of the Association of Domestic Tour Operators of India (Maharashtra chapter).
 
Nicknamed Crossroads of the World, Times Square is a focal point of the global entertainment industry and hosts over 39 million visitors annually.

Investors make big gains with Snowman Logistics  sizzling debutCrisil
(The stock, which opened…)
MUMBAI: Snowman Logistics IPO, the first public issue since Narendra Modi took over the new government, listed at a huge premium of 62% over its offer price, bringing a big cheer to investors, especially the HNIs who had aggressively bid the issue with IPO funding. This is the best debut in terms of the listing premium in the last four and a half years.
The stock, which opened at Rs 76 on the NSE against the offer price of Rs 47, closed at Rs 79.80, nearly 70% premium to the offer price. Over one crore shares of the company were traded on both the exchanges while orders for 55 lakh shares were pending for execution on the BSE and the NSE at the end of day. The market capitalisation of the company stood at Rs 1,311 crore.
Based on FY14 results, the company is valued at a P/E multiple of 41.
Investors made Rs 136 core profit on an issue of Rs 200 crore on the listing day. It means the retail investor who has applied for a minimum bid quantity of 300 shares by paying Rs 14,100 received a whopping profit of Rs 9,840 on day one. The Snowman IPO received bids for 194.43 crore shares compared with 3.25 crore shares on offer. While retail portion was subscribed 41 times, HNI and QIB portion was subscribed by 222 times and 17 times, respectively.
As the HNI portion was subscribed 222 times, it was required to list at a premium of over 52% to make reasonable returns for those HNIs who have borrowed money at an interest rate of 7%.
HNIs who borrowed at 7% interest rate have made 23% profits as the allotment cost of one share was Rs 17.40. HNIs would have made money only if the issue listed above Rs 64.85. At 7.5%, the cost per share was Rs 66.12 and at 8%, it was Rs 67.40 per share.
Bangalore-based Snowman Logistics, which operates in the niche business segment of temperature-controlled logistics service, will use funds for more warehouses across the country. It aims to add 4-5 warehouses every year till 2018 at least. As of March 31, 2014, the company had 23 temperature-controlled warehouses across 14 locations in India.
After the proceeds of this successful IPO are used up in a year, the company may look at raising more funds to make some acquisitions, chairman Gopinath Pillai told ET. Snowman may consider taking a loan or raising equity through a rights issue, Pillai added.
Some of the anchor investors of Snowman IPO include Faering Capital India, ICICI Prudential, IDFC Sterling and IDFC Infrastructure. The company is promoted by Gateway Distriparks, which will hold 40.4% post the issue. The IPO has been graded by CRISIL as 'CRISIL IPO Grade 4', indicating above average fundamentals.
Cheap IPO funding at neverbefore-seen rates of 7% was largely responsible for the massive demand for the recent two IPOs.

NCDs in secondary market yield morebonds
(Investors looking to invest…)
MUMBAI: Investors looking to invest in non-convertible debentures (NCDs) through the primary market currently have three options available.
Muthoot Finance , Manappuram Finance and Muthoot Fincorp, all Kerala-based gold-loan specialists, put together are raising Rs 1,000 crore via this debt instrument, offering interest rates as high as 12%.
Muthoot Finance's issue with an AA-minus rating carries interest rates up to 11.5% while Muthoot Fincorp, rated A, is offering a maximum of 12% and A-plus-rated Manappuram, up to 11.75%. Investors can choose among monthly, annual and cumulative interest payment options with tenures ranging from 400 days to 75 months.
The interest rates offered by these non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) are 2-2.5% more than the rates on fixed bank deposits. But distributors say investors may skip these public issues as there are better deals available in the secondary market. "Investors can get issuances with a higher rating and yield from the secondary market," said Rupesh Bhansali, head of distribution at GEPL Capital. For example, Muthoot Finance's N6 series, which also carries an AA-minus rating but with a coupon of 12.25% and maturing in September 2016, trades at Rs 999, giving a yield of 12.33%. Similarly, Shriram Transport Finance's AA-rated, 2016-dated NM series pays a coupon of 11.35%, and yields 11.06% at the current price of Rs 1,056.
However, there are problems while buying in the secondary market. In a new issue, units are typically offered at face value of Rs 1,000 and the coupon rate and tenure of the instrument are mentioned in the form. That means you have a clear idea of how much you can earn from the NCD when you fill the form. However, while buying it from the secondary market, you have to do your own calculations.
Due to multiple issuances from NBFCs and different rates to individuals and corportes, there are many series of the same company which are traded. For example, Shriram Transport Finance has as many as 37 series of NCDs trading in the secondary market. "These NCDs could be illiquid and hence, investors should buy them with an objective of holding till maturity," said Jitendra Solanki, a certified financial planner.

Ranbaxy faces multi-pronged battle on Nexium...astra
(Ranbaxy was scheduled to…)
NEW DELHI: Ranbaxy Laboratories is facing increasing pressure from different states in the US, rival generic drugmakers, consumer groups, drug retailers and wholesalers to either immediately bring to market the first generic version of British-Swedish innovator AstraZeneca's blockbuster heartburn drug Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium) or bow out to allow other companies to launch the drug.
The Gurgaon-based drugmaker, which was acquired by Sun Pharma in April, was scheduled to launch in late May the generic version of the second-best selling drug in the US under a six-month exclusive marketing opportunity, but it has failed to do so till date.
Attorney General of Connecticut George Jepsen last week urged the US Food and Drug Administration to either make Ranbaxy deliver on its promise or scrap its drug application and allow other generic drugmakers in the queue to make low-priced version of the drug which earns its parent firm over $5 billion a year in the US alone.
In another statement, Jepsen said, "Ranbaxy's actions have stalled FDA approval of any other generic drug alternatives to Astra-Zeneca's Nexium." He added that consumers should not suffer as a result of the company's manufacturing problems — problems that "Ranbaxy may not be motivated to resolve as it continues to profit under its deal with AstraZeneca".
After fighting a patent battle to launch the first generic drug, Ranbaxy had in 2008 settled its litigation with AstraZeneca, a common industry practice, to delay its generic launch until May 27 this year for commercial benefits. It also got into a tie-up with AstraZeneca to supply raw materials for the same drug, through which Jepsen has alleged that Ranbaxy continues to profit.
Jepsen's request to the FDA follows a citizen's petition filed by an unnamed 'generic drugmaker' in May, reviewed by ET, which argues that the FDA should have scrapped Ranbaxy's drug applications seeking generic exclusivities, including Nexium, because it had originated from Paonta Sahib and Dewas, units blacklisted by the US drug regulator for manufacturing lapses and generating falsified data.
The petition claims that the scale of fraudulent activities at Ranbaxy makes it implausible that drug applications filed at that time from affected facilities were not fraught with flawed data. If Ranbaxy has renewed its application for the same drugs from another site, that should be treated as a new application and the company should lose its status as the first generic applicant and forego the 180 days exclusive marketing opportunities it is holding on to.
Ranbaxy has been reeling under prolonged regulatory troubles in the US and all its India-based plants have now been banned from shipping to that country. Five months ago, rival drugmaker Sun Pharma agreed to buy it from Japanese parent Daiichi Sankyo for $3.2 billion. A Ranbaxy spokesperson refused to comment on the matter but in its response to the US FDA in July, reviewed by ET, the company claimed that these charges were built on an unsubstantiated conjecture that all its applications from select manufacturing sites were fraught with "unreliable data", which cannot be assumed as true.
  "The citizen's petition is premised on numerous factual errors, gross mischaracterisations and rank speculation which cannot form the basis of any reasoned decision," Ranbaxy said in its response. The company added that changing of site for a drug application was not an uncommon practice and did not make its drug application 'new'. It also argued that the consent-decree it had signed with the FDA was a court-approved agreement, which the US drug regulator could not alter unilaterally to revoke any firstto-file opportunities.
Ranbaxy and a few other drugmakers are also defending a suit in the district court of Massachusetts with regard to the same drug, brought upon by consumer groups and drug retailers which have accused it of conspiring with Astra-Zeneca to delay the generic and deprive American consumers of a cheaper alternative.
Analysts expect Ranbaxy to earn $180-250 million in the first six months if it manages to successfully launch a generic Nexium in the US.

Best quotes from Scottish independence referendum campaignBest quotes from Scottish independence referendum campaign
AFP
Scotland votes on whether to become independent of Britain in a close-fought referendum on Thursday. Here are some of the most memorable quotes which have emerged during the campaign:
   
"No one, absolutely no one, will do a better job of running Scotland than the people who live and work in Scotland. On September 18, we have the opportunity of a lifetime."
First Minister Alex Salmond, who is leading the "Yes" to independence campaign, in a TV debate on August 5.
   
"Any eight-year-old can tell you the flag of a country, the capital of a country and its currency. Now, I presume the flag is the Saltire, I assume our capital will still be Edinburgh but you can't tell us what currency we'll have."
Pro-union campaign leader Alistair Darling to Alex Salmond in the same debate.
   
"People can feel it is a bit like a general election, that you make a decision and five years later you can make another decision... if you're fed up with the effing Tories give them a kick. This is totally different from a general election, this is a decision about not the next five years, it's a decision about the next century."
British Prime Minister David Cameron refers to the unpopularity of his Conservative party, which is backing the union, on a visit to Edinburgh on September 10.
   
"The more I listen to the 'Yes' campaign, the more I worry about its minimisation and even denial of risks. Whenever the big issues are raised -- our heavy reliance on oil revenue if we become independent, what currency we'll use, whether we'll get back into the EU -- reasonable questions are drowned out by accusations of 'scaremongering'."
"Harry Potter" author JK Rowling, a leading backer of the campaign to keep Scotland part of Britain, in a statement on her views on June 11.
   
"One of the greatest changes in Scotland is that people have grown bored with moaners and naysayers. Don't grumble -- get it done."
Irvine Welsh, the Scottish author of "Trainspotting" and a "Yes" campaign supporter, on Twitter on September 9.
   
"The United Kingdom has been an extraordinary partner to us -- from the outside at least it looks like things have worked pretty well and we obviously have a deep interest in making sure that one of the closest allies that we will ever have remains (a) strong, robust, united and effective partner."
US President Barack Obama on the state of the union at a G7 summit in Brussels on June 5.
"It's hard to see how the world would be helped by an independent Scotland. I think that the people who would like to see the break-up of the United Kingdom are not the friends of justice, the friends of freedom."
Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott on Scottish independence in comments published by the Times newspaper on August 16.
   
"It is the Scots who have succeeded most in preserving the British idea of fairness and compassion in terms of state support and intervention. Ironically, it is England, since the 1980s, which has embarked on a separate journey."
Leading Scottish historian Tom Devine reveals he is backing the "Yes" camp in an interview with the Observer newspaper on August 17.
   
"The referendum campaign has been the most exciting thing to happen to Scotland in my lifetime."
Scottish actor Alan Cumming, star of the "X Men" films, urging a "Yes" vote in a public appearance on September 8.

Grand Theft Auto V  coming to PS4 and Xbox One in November#gta v #grand theft auto v #grand theft auto #gaming #ps4 #xbox one #playstation 4 #rockstar games
San Francisco: Rockstar Games on Friday announced that the latest instalment of its crime-themed blockbuster video game Grand Theft Auto will hit PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles in November.
Grand Theft Auto V will be packed with enhancements when it is released for play on the new-generation consoles from rivals Microsoft and Sony, according to publisher Take-Two Interactive Software.
The game "will feature a range of major visual and technical upgrades to make Los Santos and Blaine County more immersive than ever."
GTA V for the beefed-up consoles will boast new weapons and vehicles along with "denser traffic."
GTA V for the beefed-up consoles will boast new weapons and vehicles along with "denser traffic."
The number of people who could play simultaneously in online sessions will be ramped to 30.
People who pre-order the title are being promised a million dollars - in pretend in-game cash to spend while playing.
Take-Two posted a new video of game action behind an age-gate online at www.rockstargames.com/V.
Actress Lindsay Lohan is suing the creators of Grand Theft Auto V over a character she contends is an unsanctioned virtual version of herself.
She filed a lawsuit in July in New York City, where Take-Two is based.
Lawyers for Take-Two and subsidiary Rockstar have fired back in court, arguing Lohan's suit is without merit and was pursued for publicity.
Billion-dollar debut
Versions of GTA V hit the streets in September of last year for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles as well as on computers powered by Windows software.
GTA V raked in more than a billion dollars in a record-shattering first three days on the shelves for the unabashedly violent video game.
Take-Two chief executive Strauss Zelnick called the game "a cultural phenomenon."
Take-Two's unit Rockstar Games spent five years crafting the title, with a rumoured production budget of $270 million, and the time paid off for gamers, according to a slew of reviews giving it top marks.
The GTA franchise has won legions of fans, and about as many critics, for game play in which winning depends on acts such as carjacking, gambling and killing.
Play in Grand Theft Auto games has included simulated sex with prostitutes and drunken driving.
The fifth instalment in the GTA series is set in a fictional city of Los Santos based on real-world Los Angeles and its nearby hills and beaches.
Rockstar said that GTA V "focuses on the pursuit of the almighty dollar" in a re-imagined Southern California.
It was billed by Take-Two as the "largest and most ambitious" title in a franchise that has sold more than 114 million copies since its debut in 1997.
Fans say GTA appeals with captivating story lines and an open-world format that lets players go wherever they wish in game worlds, noting that players can rob banks, take a yoga lesson or fly a plane, as well as play with or against one another online.

5.5-inch Apple iPhone 6 Plus in greater demand than the 4.7-inch iPhone 6#apple #iphone 6 #iphone 6 plus #smartphones
Bangalore: Customers may have to wait three to four weeks to get their hands on Apple's iPhone 6 Plus, after a record number of orders for the company's latest smartphones strained available supply.
The new iPhone 6 goes on sale on September 19 in the United States but the company began taking online orders on Thursday. While the larger 5.5-inch Plus models now display a wait time of up to a month, the 4.7-inch version remains available for delivery on September 19, Apple's website showed.

Verizon Wireless, AT&T and Sprint, also showed shipment delays of up to six weeks on their respective websites. Apple said the pace of orders has so far outstripped any of its previous iPhones.
Customers may have to wait three to four weeks to get their hands on Apple's iPhone 6 Plus.
"Response to iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus has been incredible, with a record number of pre-orders overnight. Pre-orders are currently available online or through the Apple Store App," spokeswoman Trudy Muller said.
ALSO SEE Apple iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus review: They neutralise a key Android advantage
Apple routinely grapples with iPhone supply constraints, particularly in years that involve a smartphone re-design. The latest iPhones come with larger screens and some analysts had anticipated that production issues may keep a lid on initial runs.
Its suppliers had scrambled to get enough screens ready because the need to redesign a key component had disrupted panel production, supply chain sources told Reuters last month.

It was unclear whether the hiccup could limit the number of phones available to consumers, the sources said at the time. Apple declined to comment on supply chain issues.
In addition, Chinese customers may also have to wait until the year-end before they can buy the iPhone 6. Apple is yet to set a release date for China, the world's biggest smartphone market.
The company unveiled its latest iPhones along with a watch and a mobile payments service on Tuesday.
AT&T's chief executive of mobile and business, Ralph de la Vega, told investors at a conference in New York that iPhone 6 orders have so far surpassed orders last year and the year before.
"It is such a great thing to wake up in the morning to know that you have hundreds of thousands of orders already before you even have a cup of coffee," said the executive.
Apple's iPhones tend to incite the kind of initial buying frenzy unknown to many other brands, partly because of the company's well-honed marketing tactics.
On secondary markets online, the rights to a pre-ordered iPhone 6 Plus are worth as much as double the unsubsidised sticker price. One eBay auction for an unlocked 128-gigabyte gold version of the 5.5-inch phone, for example, was bidding at $1,625 on Friday afternoon, compared with a face value of $949.One post on the New York City edition of Craigslist sought $10,000 the privilege to "be one of the first & few people to own this model and before the rest of the world."
New iPhones tend to get listed at stratospheric prices on various online retail sites from the United States to China, on the assumption that there's big demand from people who must get their hands on the phone from day one. That in turns fuels a grey market of dealers who buy in bulk for resale.

Russian President Vladimir Putin’s goal is to destroy Ukraine as an independent country and to restore the Soviet Union, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk said on Saturday.
Speaking at an conference in Kiev attended by European and Ukrainian lawmakers and business leaders, Yatseniuk also praised a new wave of economic sanctions imposed on Russia by the European Union and the United States and said they posed a major threat to the Russian economy.
“We are still in a stage of war and the key aggressor is the Russian Federation … Putin wants another frozen conflict (in eastern Ukraine),” Yatseniuk said.
“His goal is to take the entire Ukraine … Russia is a threat to the global order and to the security of the entire Europe.”

Brisk polling in 3 Lok Sabha  33 assembly seats; high stakes for BJP in Uttar PradeshComments
Brisk voting was recorded in most of the 33 assembly seats and 3 Lok Sabha seats where bypolls were held on Saturday.
In Uttar Pradesh voting percentage was highest  in Mainpuri Lok Sabha constituency, which was vacated by Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh. Mulayam's grandnephew Tej Pratap Singh Yadav, 27, is contesting the seat on an SP ticket.
Among the voters was chief minister Akhilesh Yadav who landed in Saifai to cast his ballot.
Lack of enthusiasm was witnessed among the voters in the first two hours in all the constituencies, but slowly picked up later. By 3 pm around 44 % had cast their votes. Mild rains also affected the voter turnout.
The Mainpuri seat was held by SP, while all the eleven Assembly seats where voting is on were held by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
In West Bengal voting was brisk in Basirhat Dakshin while Chowringhee had lower voter turnout. Both the Left and the BJP accused the ruling TMC of terrorising voters, BJP's Basirhat candidate Samik Bhatatcharya said.
Over 62% polling was recorded in Basirhat Dakshin while nearly 40% voters exercised their franchise in Chowringhee  till 2 pm.
Voting was also brisk and peaceful in Telangana, Rajasthan and other states where bypolls are held.
Analysts are looking to see which way the wind blows in the bypolls spread across these nine states.
The results of two Lok Sabha seats — Vadodara which was vacated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Medak in Telangana was vacated by Telangana Rashtra Samithi chief and chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao — are unlikely to throw any surprises. But Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav’s prestige is at stake in his home turf Mainpuri, the third Lok Sabha seat.
The bypolls are being seen as an indicator of the popularity of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and opposition parties ahead of four assembly elections to be held this year.
They also pose a key question on the future of the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in Uttar Pradesh.
The BJP swept to power on the back of a so-called Modi wave this summer, but failed to maintain the momentum in last month’s by-elections in four states where it lost a majority of seats to the Congress party and its allies.
The BJP and its allies together won only eight of the 18 seats that went to the polls while the Congress and its allies won 10.
In the last Lok Sabha polls, a large number of OBCs and Dalits rallied behind the BJP across the Hindi belt. The shift dented the SP and BSP’s support base in the largest electoral state. The SP won just seven seats while Mayawati’s BSP drew a blank.
The grand alliance of the RJD-JDU-Congress could halt the BJP’s charge into this caste base. In the absence of such an alliance in Uttar Pradesh, any further losses may lead to an existential crisis for the two caste-based parties.
If the opposition parties — especially the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress in Rajasthan, Gujarat and Assam — can stop the BJP’s march, their claim about the Modi wave waning will receive a further boost.
With elections in Maharashtra and Haryana due next month, any by-election victory will also give the beleaguered Congress a fresh face saver after its humiliating Lok Sabha defeat.
But it may not be so easy for the opposition. Of the 33 seats, 11 are in Uttar Pradesh where the BJP swept 71 of 80 Lok Sabha seats.
In Gujarat and Rajasthan, where 13 assembly seats are up for grabs, the opposition could not even open its account in the general election.
Three seats are heading for the polls in Congress-ruled Assam where the BJP bagged 50% of Lok Sabha constituencies.
In West Bengal, the ruling Trinamool Congress will be desperate to win both seats as it wants to show that the Saradha scam has not hurt the party’s prospects.
For the BJP, a win or even a number two position in the results from Assam and Bengal will further cement its position as a fast emerging force, replacing traditional opposition parties like AGP and Left, respectively.
The by-elections in Chhattisgarh, Sikkim, Andhra and Tripura will test if the ruling parties can further consolidate their positions. Tripura is the only state where the Left is in power.

Pfizer Inc  and Ranbaxy Laboratories  Ltd on Friday won dismissal of an antitrust lawsuit accusing them of conspiring to delay sales of generic versions of the cholesterol drug Lipitor, the best-selling drug in history.
US District Judge Peter Sheridan in Trenton, New Jersey ruled that the plaintiffs, retailers and distribution companies that bought Lipitor directly from Pfizer, failed to plead their case with enough detail.
The lawsuit was filed in 2012 by retailers and distributors that bought Lipitor directly from Pfizer.

The Ugly Story Of USL s Balance Sheet!Tweet
Published on Sat, Sep 13,2014 | 13:45, Updated at Mon, Sep 15 at 17:27Source : CNBC-TV18 |   Watch Video :
Last week India’s largest booze company United Spirits wrote off Rs 4359 cr; thereby eroding it’s networth by half. USL will now have to file with the BIFR under the Sick Industrial Companies Act. While that may be a technical filing, the nature and extent of write –offs are very grave and suggest more to come. Sajeet Manghat and Payaswini Upadhyay find out what went wrong, why and who’s to blame?
After a delay of 3 months, the United Spirits Board finally signed off on the company’s FY14 balance-sheet last week. The numbers are finally public and they tell an ugly story - of rampant and opaque intra-group financing, diversion of funds and maybe also the failure of the company's internal audit functions.
USL has made 3 sets of provisions in the FY14 balance sheet. The first has to do with Whyte & Mackay.
That’s a UK based company acquired by USL in 2007 and sold in 2014 on directions of competition authorities. USL says the net proceeds from the sale of Whyte & Mackay will be insufficient to fully repay the intra-USL group loans taken to purchase the company. The reduction in Whyte & Mackay’s value and subsequent diminution of investment value in 2 of its arms prompted an exceptional provision of Rs 4321 crores.  
Amarjit Chopra
Former President, ICAI
“If this kind of provisioning is required - more than Rs 4,000 crore is the diminution in the value of the subsidiary’s investments for that particular matter - it can’t happen overnight and to me it must have continued for years together.”
Santhana Krishnan
Managing Partner, PKF S&S
“As far as the valuation of the investment goes, probably because of the poor economic conditions and over valuation of the brand itself, it could have resulted in a loss. That loss is more in my opinion not with any devious intentions but could be because of valuation methodologies and hope on the future.”
The second set of provisions is for doubtful debts/advances and loans. These doubtful debts throw up 2 important issue s- whether the provisioning is adequate? But more importantly whether these doubtful debts are also connected to diversion of funds.
USL has provisioned Rs 1123 crore towards doubtful debts - this includes Rs 649.55 crores for prior periods as assessed by the company. But it’s not clear what the total amount of doubtful debts are and whether this is a full or partial provisioning
Amarjit Chopra
Former President, ICAI
“What is surprising to me is that if they say that out of an X amount only 10, 12, 13 or 15 percent is only to be provided - whether it is based upon certain criteria or is it that in the other cases litigation is not there that I don’t find. I personally feel that in all those cases which have been given, the litigation has been there but only certain percentage thereof has been provided for. To me it may not be possible to say whether it is adequate or not adequate but I personally feel that the auditors would have had gone deeper in to the matter and must have satisfied themselves with regard to the provisioning.”
Not just the amounts but the circumstances that led to the creation of these doubtful debts are equally shocking!  
The USL management reveals that that over Rs 600 cr of advances and loans provided to some entities are now being disputed by those entities. These were advances by USL to tie-up manufacturing units. The advances were meant for enhancing capacity, obtaining exclusivity and lease deposits. But the tie-up manufacturing units now claim that they borrowed this money but in turn advanced these amounts to certain UB group entities and will only be able to pay once they recover their money from the UB group entities.
The USL management says, "the claims made in relation to the advances to the parties may indicate that all or some amounts may have been improperly advanced by the company to such parties for, in turn, being advanced to the alleged UB group entities."
The board has authorised a detailed inquiry into this diversion of funds and the auditor has played the safe, waiting game saying - ‘Pending such inquiry, we are unable to comment on the nature of these transactions; the provision established; or any further impact on the financial statements..’
Santhana Krishnan
Managing Partner, PKF S&S
“At least from the accounting notes that have come it’s very clear that these monies have been diverted. However, also you can’t wait for one and a half years and still say that I am unable to express an opinion. Three, very interesting to note, who have been the auditors of those group companies. If it was the same auditor, you can’t say that I didn’t even know about it. However, very important is these kinds of payments that have been made for enhancing the production capabilities all that could have easily been verified with the reference to your board resolution and whether any money has actually been spent on this.”
The 3rd set of provisioning relates to USL’s unsecured loans. And the question that needs answers is if the extent of provisioning IS adequate?
Over and above the advances that have been partly provided for, USL has clubbed Rs 1337 crores of receivables from Vijay Mallya owned UB Holding and classified them as unsecured loans. The new management at USL believes it will be able to recover the loans from Mallya’s company. Hence it has for provisioned only Rs 330 crores towards principle outstanding. It has also stopped recognition of interest income of Rs 96 crores as a matter of prudence. The management says it hopes to eventually recover the entire Rs 1422.31 crores.
Amarjit Chopra
Former President, ICAI
“These kind of transactions are seen rarely and I have not seen anywhere else, very frankly, that you consolidate all kind of, whatever receivables were there from UB, you consolidate them into one and you say that you have to recover this particular X amount but then there is a moratorium period for six years and total repayment period is eight years, I am baffled.”
Santhana Krishnan
Managing Partner, PKF S&S
“I don’t think it’s very rare and when the world financial crisis came in that is what the banks had done in terms of mortgage loans and they did exactly the same kind of things probably under different heads and under different manner. However, I think something which the management should completely desisted from doing and the auditor should have said this is unacceptable behaviour from the management.”
The 3 sets of provisioning - repayment of loans, doubtful debts and unsecured loans- and the factors surrounding them give rise to 1 question- the role of USL’s auditors.
    
The current auditors have qualified that financial statement of earlier years and consequently the opening balances may have been incorrectly stated; thereby questioning the work of previous auditors who were responsible for the balance sheet up to March 31st 2013. USL’s Board has also recommended that specialists relook at the accounts.
Santhana Krishnan
Managing Partner, PKF S&S
“It is not as though that overnight these items do become bad or you suddenly unearth it. Did he have leads and you didn’t pursue them, could be one of the questions that they will have to ask. The second is, the auditing standards very clearly establish you can’t just depend on confirmation. You are supposed to be doing additional work to ensure that this confirmation is only one of the methods by which you satisfy yourself. In my opinion they will also come under scrutiny.”
Amarjit Chopra
Former President, ICAI
“Till last year the reports are totally unmodified. There was absolutely no qualification; there was absolutely no disclaimer on any of the points. These are absolutely clean reports with regards to the various issues. So I think if at all we have to talk about the auditor, it is those up to March 31, 2013 before we talk of the audit for the year 2013-2014.”
Several undisclosed intra-group transactions, possible diversion of funds, questionable auditing – will all this add up to criminal action against the previous Board and management of USL?
Santhana Krishnan
Managing Partner, PKF S&S
“As far as criminality is concerned it is established that these are accounting entries and what is stated in the notes on accounts and in the auditor’s qualification are reasonably proved out. Obviously they will very clearly come under the present definition of fraud under the new Companies Act and old Companies Act having been repealed, the new Companies Act will call this as a fraud and all criminal provisions will apply for all this.”
Amarjit Chopra
Former President, ICAI
“If it can be proved that it was in the knowledge of the management that these things were happening, I think the boards which is supposed to act in the fiduciary capacity, the board which is supposed to act diligently, the board which is supposed act in the interest of the various stakeholders probably there may be liability.”
These are just some of the problems revealed by USL’s FY14 balance sheet – they clearly raise enough red flags for regulators like SEBI and ICAI to look into the accounting practices at the company. Similar scrutiny of other Mallya companies might also be prudent.

SEBI s Insider Trading Crackdown: Who Is An  Officer Tweet
Published on Sat, Sep 13,2014 | 13:45, Updated at Mon, Sep 15 at 17:57Source : CNBC-TV18 |   Watch Video :
Over the last 6 months of or so SEBI’s Adjudicating Officers have found several corporate employees guilty of violating the prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations, 1992. All the orders are to do with the same violation – the employees failed to disclose to the company and stock exchange, trades exceeding Rs 5 lakhs in value.
WHO IS AN ‘OFFICER’?
-12 orders against corporate employees
-Guilty of violating disclosure norms in Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations, 1992
-Did not disclose share trades in excess of Rs 5 lakhs
The PIT Regulations require that
"(4) Any person who is a director or officer of a listed company, shall disclose to the company and the stock exchange…if there has been a change in such holdings of such person and his dependents…and the change exceeds Rs. 5 lakh in value or 25,000 shares or 1% of total shareholding or voting rights, whichever is lower.”
This disclosure has to be done within 2 working days of the transaction.
The dozen employees found guilty include a Human Resource Head in a vertical business unit at ITC, a Chief Sales Officer in charge of certain geographies at Wipro, a General Manager of special products at M&M, a General Manager of plant quality at M&M Nasik and a Senior Vice President in charge of manufacturing processes.

In finding them guilty, SEBI seems to have expanded the definition of ‘officer’ considerably to include any person with authority to give directions to other employees. So who exactly is an ‘officer’? To answer that question, CNBC-TV18’s Menaka Doshi speaks to JSA’s Somasekhar Sundaresan and Finsec’s Sandeep Parekh.
Doshi: The main debate in this, almost one dozen orders, seems to focus on how you define “Officer”? Would you agree Sandeep that Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) seems to have widened the definition of officer considerably to even include general mangers?  
Parekh: Yes, I think they seem to have widened that and the real flaw lies with a particular SAT ruling, which they have relied on in almost all the cases, which is the Sundaram Finance case where they have in fact misinterpreted the definition of Officer which is there in Companies Act. It seems to suggest that those people who can give directions to the Board of Directors or Directors. Essentially we were looking at people one level below the Board. We are not looking at people who can - which is what the interpretation of SAT is.
WHO IS AN ‘OFFICER’?
Companies Act
1956 Act: Section 2 (30)
Officer - includes any director, manager or secretary or any person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the Board of directors or any one or more of the directors is or are accustomed to act   
2013 Act: Section 2 (59)
Officer-  includes any director, manager or key managerial personnel or any person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the Board of Directors or any one or more of the directors is or are accustomed to act
WHO IS AN ‘OFFICER’?
SAT Order
Sundaram Finance vs SEBI (2010)
"....We are of the view that an 'officer' means a person holding an appointment to an office which carries with it an authority to give directions to other employees. Thus, an 'officer' as distinct from a mere employee is a person who has the power of directing any person or persons to do anything whereas an employee is one who only obeys. Any person who occupies a position of responsibility in a company will be an officer and this has been clarified by the Department of Company Affairs, Government of India as per its letter dated October 07,1963...."
Doshi: Not just one level; many levels below the Board.
Parekh: If you report to anybody at all which basically means everybody except for the sweepers, assuming that sweepers dose not have….. (Interrupted)
Doshi: Even maintenance staff responds to one leader of some sort. So the head of the maintenance staff would also then come under the definition of officer, because his directions are followed by group of employees.
Parekh: So anybody except for the last layer of the company would actually be liable which is completely absurd and contrary to what is specifically put in. I mean you can’t imagine a second rung from the bottom giving directions to the Board of Directors. That’s the absurd part.
Doshi: Couple of things here- the definition of the officer as per either Company Law, old one because that's the one that applies in this case and how the Sundaram Finance case looks at it. So the old Companies Act 1956 says officer includes any director, manager or secretary or any person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the board of directors or any one or more of the directors is or are accustomed to act. The Sundaram Finance case say an officer means a person holding an appointment to an office which carries with it an authority to give directions to other employees. Which one are we supposed to follow in trying to determine whether these people are officers or not?  
Sundaresan: The flaw really lies in having a charging provision on an officer. It should have been on the basis of functionality of roles. To take your earlier comment, if it’s a sweeper whose job is to clean the office of the CFO or the office of the MD, there is a good chance he will have physical access to unpublished price sensitive information. So giving a designation for an officer or a peon or a manager I think that’s a very wrong artificial….(Interrupted)
Doshi: What are we talking about? Go back to the specific sections of the PIT regulations and these are disclosure Sections right? It says any person who is a director or officer of a listed company, shall disclose to the company etc. So, they have equated director and officer.
Sundaresan: The point I am making is the flaw in the regulation is to have a charge on an officer rather than have a charging provision only on materiality of the transaction.  
Parekh: No, but this is not substantive insider trading.
Doshi: It’s only a lack of disclosures.
Sundaresan: In my view, if a trade is of a particular material nature, regardless of designation it should be picked up for reporting, and that can’t be Rs 5 lakh; that's too low a threshold.
Doshi: Is it your contention, therefore and I will read out some designation involved here:
General Manager – Special Projects, General Manager – Product Management, Sr General Manager – Technical Hub, General Manager – Plant Quality, Mechanical engineer with technical background and working with central process engineering for five Mahindra Plants, Sr Vice President of Manufacturing, General Manager – EDC, General Manager – Vehicle integration. Are these Officers as envisaged by PIT regulations; because it says officers or directors?  
Sundaresan: It’s a question of fact.
Parekh: I would respectfully disagree with Som on whether it’s a matter of fact because I think it’s a matter of Law. Law says a person who is used to giving instructions to the board of director or directors. We are looking at very senior people. So I think the law is pretty clear, it has been misinterpreted by SAT in Sundaram case which is what has been followed by all.
Doshi: But SEBI could have chosen to apply its regulations in the simplest format and say look it’s says officer or director which is you are equating the two designation virtually.
Sundaresan: The real problem here is that because there is a power to penalise, penalties have been imposed. Look at the materiality element of some of these orders; not all. Some of them are really not material and in some cases it appears that there have been penalties by the company also internally. So some of these are also trail balloons in some sense of establishing a precedent and then that precedent will get tested and to keep following it.
Doshi: So what is the precedent here? This means pretty much anybody who runs a team of three, five or eight people or more than that in an organisation can be categorised officer by SEBI as ‘officers’, and hence if they have sold shares that violates any of this threshold and not made disclosures- these are only disclosure norms I am talking about and not about the insider trading in purest sense of insider trading- they are guilty?
Sundaresan: I will come back to my original point. The problem is materiality of the threshold.
Parekh: Let's get to principles - what is the purpose of this particular regulation? The purpose is that if you routinely have access to inside information, we will impose a higher standard on you. If you going to apply the same standard on all employees, then you should have said employees. Why should we say officer as defined by Companies Act which talks of those people who instruct board of director level people?
Sundaresan: There is logic to it. If you are reasonably expected to have access to information, you are an insider. If you have sold beyond a certain materiality threshold- lets say you have done a Rs 25 lakh trade or a Rs 50 lakh trade- do you think a defence can be I am only a peon but I have traded for Rs 25 lakhs. Peon is a very bad example perhaps. Let say or a general manger for a large functional role and you have sold for Rs 25 lakhs - you may not have had access directly but somebody who has had access would have given you the information.
Doshi: Ok so this is beautiful, because this is the most curious part of many of these orders. They find all these general managers fit the category of officer and say you have sold more than Rs 5 lakh worth of shares, you didn’t make disclosures to the company and the Stock Exchange; hence you are guilty. Many of these people are self confessedly people who have sold in closed periods. The orders mention that as well saying look you have sold in a closed period as your company has disclosed to us. But the orders and the penalty amount doesn’t take violation into account at all. So whatever beautiful fine point you are making I am saying in this case when it just comes to the disclosure requirements, have these adjudicating officers been fair to expand the definition so wide and why is it that they have ignored the closed period trades which to me seems like a more egregious violation than the lack of a disclosure at a general manager level?   
Sundaresan: There are two points that comes from your comment; the second one is the easier one which Sandeep started with. They are applying a case law laid down by the SAT. So the AO is just applying what SAT has said- right, wrong; it’s not his thing. The Sundaram Finance didn’t carry the SAT order up in appeal in the Supreme Court. So whether we like it or not, that’s a judgment of SAT which is applicable and they have applied it.
But on the other issue, in terms of whether they have done any other violations and whether that has been let off in all likelihood and we don’t know because the orders don’t speak about it. In all likelihood these were instances reported by the company to SEBI under Clause 7 of the model code. So the company would have taken its own action and would have forwarded it to SEBI for reporting. So SEBI could have well taken a view that if the guy has been penalised, if there is also a disclosure problem - so now I will penalise the disclosure bit. Ideally all this should be articulated in the order. The orders are silent about it; we don’t know.
Doshi: The orders have penalized ostensibly only on the lack of disclosures. Nowhere in the penalty portions does it say we are penalizing you for this violation; though the violation of closed period trade is mentioned somewhere.
Sundaresan: So they have exercised their prerogative to pick the violation – that’s their regulatory discretionary view.
Parekh: I would put that one step further; I would say that these are all killing mosquitoes or flies with nuclear weapons. Why are we getting into small technical violations?
Doshi: How does one make that argument? That I can’t sit here saying why are you getting into technical violation. It’s a technical violation, it’s a technical violation!
Sundaresan: Shri Ram Mutual Fund judgement of the Supreme Court is being parroted. It's a wrong law.
SC: SEBI vs Shri Ram MF
“once the violation of statutory regulations is established, imposition of penalty becomes sine qua non of violation…’
Doshi: It’s parroted in these orders as well.
Sundaresan: It’s wrongly interpreted. The Supreme Court has not said that if there is a violation you have to penalise. The court has not said that. The court has acknowledged that it’s a discretionary provision.
Parekh: My question really is that why go after everybody who has violated and the fact is anything which gets reported to SEBI, they think it is their god bound duty to pass an order which penalises that person.
Doshi: Look that’s a tough one to argue. If you are in violation and if everybody agrees that you are in violation, you can’t criticise them for levying a penalty.
Sundaresan: You can criticise them because the charm in being a regulator is not in scoring penal victories. The charm in being a regulator is having a compliant market.
Doshi: The regulator feels that if I have not imposed this, these cases would not become so big. This information and this precedent would not be set. The message would not go out.
Parekh: No you can send a message; you can say that we are issuing a warning letter to these people.
Doshi : At the end of this - have you spoken to companies, how are they reacting because many companies have seriously spooked about the level of disclosures now required, if every general manager is an officer and an organisation that hires tens and thousands of employees, you are in deep trouble?
Parekh: From what I understand from the market is, it is not even clear that you need to report every violation of the model code of conduct which is not the case in this. But lot of companies are debating whether they should report every single violation because there might be hundred, two hundred violations, small technical violations, somebody has bought five shares in the closed period, stuff like that. People are confused whether they should report every single violation to SEBI. People do call up and say should we report it or not and I don’t have a clear answer because it says that you need to report substantive violation. But whether you need to report the model code violation, I don’t know.
Sundaresan: I think companies do take it seriously. The problem really is that model code applies to designated employees whereas, the disclosure provisions simply says officers, directors. Those two have to be interlinked - that is one of the areas of reform that we hope will get implemented.
Doshi: What are you telling clients? Every General Manager in your company has to make these disclosures to the company and the Stock Exchange.
Sundaresan: If it’s the beyond the materiality threshold, yes. The threshold needs reform. It’s too low; Rs 5 lakh is nothing today.

Power  water supply snapped at Ajit Singh s residence as he refused to vacate government residenceSaahil Menghani , CNN-IBN | Sep 13, 2014 at  03:34pm IST
New Delhi: In an embarrassment for former union minister Ajit Singh, power and water supply has been snapped at his residence in the national capital on Saturday. The development took place after Singh refused to vacate the government-allotted residence following his defeat in the Lok Sabha elections.
Singh is presently residing at Tughlaq Road house. He was served the eviction notice in July.
Earlier this month, a Delhi Police team faced stiff resistance from Singh's supporters when it arrived at the bungalow to get it vacated.
The bungalow has been allotted to Sports Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, who has been staying in a private guest house.
Singh lost the election from Baghpat in Uttar Pradesh to BJP's Satyapal Singh, a former Mumbai police commissioner.
The 75-year-old Jat leader is the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) president and has never lost an election since 1999 from Baghpat.

Week ahead: Fed change unlikely to blunt equitiesbonds
(Market watchers say it is…)
NEW YORK: The recent wobbly stretch in both stocks and bonds may persist for the short term if the US Federal Reserve next week lives up to expectations and signals the days of near-zero interest rates are numbered, but it is unlikely to tip valuation scales in favor of bonds any time soon.
Anxiety over the two-day Fed policy meeting, centered on expectations the central bank will likely drop its pledge to keep interest rates low for a "considerable time," was a primary driver behind stocks snapping a five-week winning streak this week and bonds absorbing their steepest losses in at least two months.
Top economists at several firms say they see at least even odds the Fed will nix the phrase from its forward guidance, which some traders may interpret as meaning that rate hikes could come as early as next March.
"If investors feel the Fed is becoming more hawkish, that's actually a negative for all asset classes with the exception of the dollar," said Chris Gaffney, senior market strategist at EverBank Wealth Management in St. Louis, Missouri.
Still, few expect such a move would translate immediately into a long-term change in investors' bullish view of stocks, especially relative to bonds.
To be sure, signs of sooner-than-expected interest rate hikes could chip away at investors' optimistic view of stocks, which scaled to new heights in no small part thanks to the Fed's quantitative easing program and decision to hold interest rates near zero per cent for nearly six years now.
But with bond yields still extraordinarily low by historic standards, and unlikely to rise drastically, many investors see equities as one of their few prospects for long-term growth.
Market watchers say it is unlikely the prospect of interest rate hikes will significantly dampen investors' taste for stocks or prompt a large-scale reallocation of funds into bonds.
"There's no doubt that there will be some volatility in the short term, but at some point equilibrium will come into the market," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.
While measures such as the forward price-to-earnings ratio on the S&P 500 suggest stocks are their priciest in nearly a decade, other measures of relative valuation to bonds remain skewed in favor of equities.
The S&P's so-called earnings yield, the inverse of the price/earnings ratio and a common yard stick for comparing equity valuations against bonds, is roughly 6.3 per cent. That is 3.7 per centage points higher than the 10-year Treasury yield , currently 2.6 per cent, whereas the long-term spread between the two is about 1.5 per centage points.
When measured against corporate junk bonds, the bond market's biggest competitor to stocks for asset flow, valuation math is tilted even more heavily in favor of equities. The average yield to maturity on junk bonds is just 6.3 per cent, according to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch fixed income index data, but the long-term average junk yield is 9.4 per cent.
  Moreover, US corporate earnings are projected to resume double-digit growth in coming quarters, according to Thomson Reuters data, which would keep a lid on P/E multiple expansion, perhaps even compress it if profit growth outpaces stock price increases.
That suggests stocks remain the better bet for returns, at least until interest rates rise significantly enough to return relative valuation measures between the two to historic norms.
In the current market environment, "There's not really a better alternative to stocks right now," says Gaffney.

MSCI may include Alibaba after investor queriesMSCI global indices may include Alibaba after investor queries
By Reuters | 13 Sep, 2014, 03.25AM IST

Under current rules, Alibaba does not qualify for inclusion in any major global indexes from any provider, although it does qualify for smaller indexes.
Editor's Pick
ET Special: All you want to know about Apple iPhone 6
Stock index provider MSCI Inc is considering changing its rules to allow shares of Alibaba Group Holding and other companies that list their shares in faraway markets to be included in its widely used indexes.
The MSCI announced that it was considering changing its rules last week, but did not explain the reason for the changes: questions from investors amid the Alibaba initial public offering, Reuters has learned from financial industry sources.
The investors argued that MSCI's ignoring stocks such as Alibaba prevents them from accurately tracking the performance of international companies, according to sources involved in the discussions, who wished to remain anonymous because they are not permitted to speak to the media.
Alibaba, a Chinese online retailer, plans to sell some $24 billion worth of shares next week on the New York Stock Exchange in a listing that could be the biggest ever IPO.
Under MSCI's rules, a company cannot be included in its biggest indexes if it is based in one region and its shares are listed in a different region. Because Alibaba is not listed anywhere in Asia and is listing in New York, it would be excluded from big MSCI indexes.
Any changes to the MSCI rules will probably have to wait until at least March 2015, according to a person familiar with the situation who declined to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media.
An MSCI spokeswoman declined to comment.
The rule changes under consideration could result in investors pouring billions of dollars into shares of companies like Alibaba and Chinese online search engine Baidu Inc.
Funds that track the performance of the MSCI Emerging Markets index and manage some $210 billion could be forced to buy Alibaba shares when the rules change. Funds with some $1.3 trillion in assets aim to duplicate the performance of the MSCI Global Investable Market indexes .
The top 30 companies by market value that could be added to MSCI indexes if rules change include besides Alibaba and Baidu, also Italian fashion company Prada SpA, which lists its shares in Hong Kong, and Samsonite International SA, a luggage company founded in the United States but listed in Hong Kong.
The total market value of those 30 companies, excluding Alibaba, is just over $410 billion. Alibaba's expected market value is $160 billion.
Under current rules, Alibaba does not qualify for inclusion in any major global indexes from any provider, although it does qualify for smaller indexes.
FUND PRESSURE
Institutional investors have also pressured another major international index provider, FTSE Group, to consider changing its rules to include companies that only list abroad, the sources said.
FTSE reiterated on Thursday that under its current rules, Alibaba would not be added to its Global Equity Index Series, which includes its well known FTSE Emerging Markets Index.
Those indexes exclude shares from companies that have American Depository Receipts on a US exchange, but no underlying listed shares in their local markets.

Around 33.9 per cent votes were polled in the by-elections to 11 Assembly seats and one Lok Sabha seat in Uttar Pradesh till 1.00 pm on Saturday amid elaborate security arrangements.
Around 35.60 per cent votes were polled in Mainpuri Lok Sabha seat where Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and his MP wife
Dimple Yadav also cast their votes this morning, while 33.73 per cent votes were polled in by-polls to 11 assembly seats.
Among the assembly constituencies, Thakurdwara in Moradabad district witnessed brisk polling with 46 per cent turn out in the first six hours, but it was tardy in Noida where only 16 per cent votes were polled.
Security personnel, including those of the central forces, have been deployed in constituencies along with micro-observers to ensure free and fair elections, according to the election office.
Video recording and photography would be conducted at all the polling centres.
The Assembly seats where bypolls are being held include Saharanpur city, Bijnor, Thakurdwara, Noida, Nighasan Lucknow east, Hamirpur, Charkhari, Sirathu, Balha and Rohania.
By-elections are also taking place in Mainpuri Lok Sabha seat, which was vacated by SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav.
Eleven Vidhan Sabha seats felt vacant after 10 BJP MLAs and one of its ally, Apna Dal were elected to the Lok Sabha.
Arrangement of web casting has been made at 176 sensitive poling stations.
While BSP is not contesting the bypoll, Congress and SP have fielded candidates on all 11 assembly seats, whereas BJP
is contesting on 10 and its ally Apna Dal on one.
In Mainpuri, BSP and Congress have not fielded their candidates. Here the contest is between Mulayam’s relative Tej Pratap Singh and BJP’s Shiv Singh Shakya.

Tata Steel plant blamed for hundreds of dengue cases in OdishaTata Steel plant blamed for hundreds of dengue cases in Odisha

Stagnant water pools and unsanitary conditions in a plant being constructed by Tata Steel Ltd in Odisha led to a dengue fever outbreak which infected more than 280 workers, killing one of them, a government official said on Friday.
Tata Steel , a unit of Tata conglomerate, is building a six-million-tonne-capacity plant in Jajpur district that is due to be completed by 2015.
Jajpur district's chief health official said the environment within the 1,700-acre building site was unclean, creating a breeding ground for mosquitoes which spread the virus.
"One death and 284 cases are linked to the Tata plant," Debendra Kumar Jena told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, adding that the outbreak began in July.
Dengue is common in India and cases generally peak in October, a peak time for mosquitoes to breed after the end of the monsoon rains.
The virus, which occurs mainly in the tropics, causes symptoms such as fever, severe headache, joint and muscular pains, vomiting and rashes.
Tata Steel said in a statement it had dispatched 19 teams to clean up the site and raise awareness among employees about how to protect themselves from dengue, malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases.
"Dengue is a problem at this time of the year. There are 40,000 people working on the Kalinga Nagar site. I am sorry to hear some people have contracted dengue. We are doing all that required from our side," T.V. Narendran, managing director of Tata Steel India, told local television.

Congress candidate for Vadodara LS bypoll recreates Modis selfie act; inquiryinitiatedVadodara Lok Sabha bypolls Congress candidate, Narendra Ravat, captures a selfie with the party symbol after casting his vote at the Sayajigunj polling station in Vadodara on Saturday. (Source: Bhupendra Rana)
Express News Service | Vadodara | Posted: September 13, 2014 2:31 pm | Updated: September 13, 2014 7:19 pm
Congress candidate for Vadodara Lok Sabha constituency, Narendra Ravat clicked a selfie of himself with his mobile phone holding Congress symbol in his left hand as soon as he emerged from polling booth in Nava Yard area in city Friday, an act that appeared to be a recreation of what PM Narendra Modi had done during the Lok Sabha election held on April 30, 2014.
Recreating Modi act, Ravat took selfie at around 9:45 am as he emerged from the election booth at Railway Colony in Nava Yard holding Congress symbol in his left hand and mobile in his right hand.
Ravat later told media that the selfie was a “symbolic protest” as he did not capture any photo of himself but acted like taking a selfie to send across the message of “angst and frustration” that the residents of Vadodara have been feeling after being affected by “man-made flood” in river Vishwamitri.
“The selfie act was a way to send across my voice and message of angst and frustration that people of Vadodara have been feeling since last few days after getting affected by flood in Vishwamitri river. I have only tried to convey to Modi and BJP how they have betrayed Barodians,” Ravat said, adding that he did not capture any photo on his mobile and neither did he post it on social media.
“Modi had clicked his picture and had even posted it on social media with the aim to promote himself. I have not broken any law by doing that,” he added. Ravat acted to capture his photograph on a Nokia mobile phone directing the front of the camera towards him, even when the mobile phone does not have any front camera.
Meanwhile, the District Election Officer (DEO) initiated inquiry into the matter at the instance of the Chief Election Officer. “We are carrying out an inquiry and the report will be submitted to the CEO and the Election Commission. Any action against Ravat, if at all he is found guilty of the matter, will be taken by CEO and the EC,” said DEO Avantika Singh.
Narendra Modi had captured his selfie outside a polling booth in Ahmedabad which attracted enough criticism from Congress and the matter was taken to the Chief Election Commission and an FIR was lodged by the state government for alleged violation of the code of conduct under the Representation of People Act as well as violation of the notification under section 188 of the IPC that prohibits campaigning within 100 metres of the booth and within 48 hours of polling. The crime branch of Ahmedabad continued…

Nifty touching 8400 levels in 3-mths can be possible: Sandeep Wagle360 Degree Feedback
("8050 will not be broken…)
In an interview with ET Now, Sandeep Wagle, Founder & CEO, Power My Wealth, shares his views on the market and some stocks. Excerpts:
ET Now: How would you characterise the week gone by and what would be your expectations for the coming week?
Sandeep Wagle: I think the market may see some consolidation or correction. From a high of 8180, we moved down to 8080, recording a 100-point correction. This 100-point correction at the 8000 level of the Nifty can be termed as a consolidation, which should have been bought into.
I do not think 8050 will be broken in any case. On the higher side, 8180 is the first target which may not be reached immediately this week, but can be reached if given a little more time. I expect it to get broken and we would eventually head towards 8200-8250 levels. Even 8400 cannot be ruled out.
This is not a one-week or two-week call. This is a two to three-month call. So, we have built a base at around 8050, and I see the Nifty in the range of 8000-8250.
ET Now: Sun Pharma was brutally beaten out of shape this week. What are the charts indicating?
Sandeep Wagle: It is a good time to enter, although a little lower will be a better bet. It is currently trading at around 804-805. I would talk of 780 to 760 as the levels to enter. I do not see the stock breaking 740, which can be a safe stop loss and my long-term targets are still intact. I would talk of levels of beyond 950-960, which could happen over the next two or three months. So, I would be tempted to buy this stock nearer 780-760.
ET Now: Do you think from a long-term perspective, auto names are good place to be in?
Sandeep Wagle: I am looking at targets of 3050-3100 in Maruti, but when the stock has moved from 1600 to 2900 or almost 3000 in the last six to eight months, I am not very sure whether one can look at a 70-80% return from the current levels. In that sense, I would wait, but as a trading play I would definitely be interested in Maruti. I would talk of a target of 3100-3150.
ET Now: Do you think that there is still more potential here?
Sandeep Wagle: We had a buy in Coromandel at around 291, and we booked some trading profits on Friday. But if you take the next 3 to 6 months or probably 6 to 12 months, one can talk of a target of 360 and I would still be comfortable talking of a target of 410-415. From the current level of 330, on corrections to 300, I would talk of a 30% to 40% trading upside over the next few months or so.
ET Now: Take us through the chart patterns of any of the stocks that you would be shorting in the infrastructure basket?
Sandeep Wagle: Some of the stocks in this space definitely look weak. For example, DLF at the current level of 175 looks weak. I do not see it cross 185. Any move upside should be treated as a corrective move and on the downside I would look at the levels of around 150-155. For JP Associates, I see more downside from the current level of 36 to the levels of 27-28.
ET Now: Run us through the top picks that you have.
Sandeep Wagle: I would go with a buy in Ingersoll Rand, that has given a very clear breakout on Friday, with a stop loss of 710, target of 900. The second call is a buy in Exide . I see more upside in it. I would buy it with a stop loss of 170, target of 185 and as a hedge I would go with a sell in Cairn India , with a stop loss of 330, target of 314.

Investors make big gains with Snowman s IPOCrisil
(The stock, which opened…)
MUMBAI: Snowman Logistics IPO, the first public issue since Narendra Modi took over the new government, listed at a huge premium of 62% over its offer price, bringing a big cheer to investors, especially the HNIs who had aggressively bid the issue with IPO funding. This is the best debut in terms of the listing premium in the last four and a half years.
The stock, which opened at Rs 76 on the NSE against the offer price of Rs 47, closed at Rs 79.80, nearly 70% premium to the offer price. Over one crore shares of the company were traded on both the exchanges while orders for 55 lakh shares were pending for execution on the BSE and the NSE at the end of day. The market capitalisation of the company stood at Rs 1,311 crore.
Based on FY14 results, the company is valued at a P/E multiple of 41.
Investors made Rs 136 core profit on an issue of Rs 200 crore on the listing day. It means the retail investor who has applied for a minimum bid quantity of 300 shares by paying Rs 14,100 received a whopping profit of Rs 9,840 on day one. The Snowman IPO received bids for 194.43 crore shares compared with 3.25 crore shares on offer. While retail portion was subscribed 41 times, HNI and QIB portion was subscribed by 222 times and 17 times, respectively.
As the HNI portion was subscribed 222 times, it was required to list at a premium of over 52% to make reasonable returns for those HNIs who have borrowed money at an interest rate of 7%.
HNIs who borrowed at 7% interest rate have made 23% profits as the allotment cost of one share was Rs 17.40. HNIs would have made money only if the issue listed above Rs 64.85. At 7.5%, the cost per share was Rs 66.12 and at 8%, it was Rs 67.40 per share.
Bangalore-based Snowman Logistics, which operates in the niche business segment of temperature-controlled logistics service, will use funds for more warehouses across the country. It aims to add 4-5 warehouses every year till 2018 at least. As of March 31, 2014, the company had 23 temperature-controlled warehouses across 14 locations in India.
After the proceeds of this successful IPO are used up in a year, the company may look at raising more funds to make some acquisitions, chairman Gopinath Pillai told ET. Snowman may consider taking a loan or raising equity through a rights issue, Pillai added.
Some of the anchor investors of Snowman IPO include Faering Capital India, ICICI Prudential, IDFC Sterling and IDFC Infrastructure. The company is promoted by Gateway Distriparks, which will hold 40.4% post the issue. The IPO has been graded by CRISIL as 'CRISIL IPO Grade 4', indicating above average fundamentals.
Cheap IPO funding at neverbefore-seen rates of 7% was largely responsible for the massive demand for the recent two IPOs.

Andhra Pradesh
Polling for the by-election to Medak Lok Sabha constituency has been slow and peaceful with some stray incidents of altercations between the supporters of TRS and Congress at a few places.
According to official reports, about 30 per cent polling was recorded till 11 am and about 40 per cent till 12 noon.
Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, whose vacation of the seat necessitated the by-election, cast his vote along with his wife at Chintamadaka village, his native village, in Siddipet mandal of Medak district around 1 pm.
He also visited his ancestral home in the village which was donated for a government school. Minister for Irrigation T. Harish Rao utilised his right to franchise at Siddipet and Congress candidate for the by-election.
Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) candidate Kotha Prabhakar Reddy cast his vote Potaram in Dubbak mandal and Deputy Speaker M. Padma Devender Reddy at Konapuram in Ramayampet mandal.
Congress candidate V. Sunitha Laxma Reddy cast her vote at Gomaram village in Narsapur Assembly constituency, while BJP candidate T. Jayaprakash Reddy tendered his vote at Sangareddy.
Scenes of voters queuing up at the polling stations were a rare sight as voters turned up sparsely in the forenoon. Polling personnel were seen sitting idle in some polling stations and the exercise was so slow that only about 12 to 18 per cent polling was recorded till 10.30 am.
Supporters of TRS and Congress parties clashed at Kothapet in Shivampet mandal, but the police intervened in time and dispersed them before the situation going out of control.

Sordid tale of rescue from the deluge in SrinagarA tale of rescue from the floods in Kashmir
Toufiq Rashid , Hindustan Times  Srinagar, September 13, 2014
First Published: 14:32 IST(13/9/2014) | Last Updated: 17:36 IST(13/9/2014)
It was a regular day of reporting. News of rain devastating most parts of Kashmir was pouring in.

Nine soldiers were trapped during rescue operations in south Kashmir. Chief minister Omar Abdullah, in a bright yellow jacket, had been overseeing rescue efforts on Saturday night last week. Preparations for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit were on.
Amid the chaos that night, a call from a friend asking about my parents was alarming.
I called my father asking about the status of water in their locality. As the by lanes appeared clogged, my parents said they might have to leave the next morning. But my father seemed convinced that the water wouldn’t breach the high walls of the MIG Colony at Qamarwari, an upmarket area of Srinagar. I carried on with my work.
At 3am on Sunday, the Jhelum breached its banks near my parents’ house. My parents told me that the water had started gushing into their three-storeyed house. By 6am, all exit points were blocked. My parents, both in their sixties, my sister-in-law and my two-year-old nephew were stranded. By 12pm, the house was under 12 feet of water.
Phones switched off
Panic-stricken, I tried calling officials. The Kashmir divisional commissioner and the Srinagar district commissioner had switched off their phones. CM Abdullah’s number was also out of reach, forcing me to leave an SMS around 11am. All I managed to reach was a disaster management official, who ironically had been rescued after three days of struggle in the flood.
The CM replied to my SMS at 4.30pm, saying Rajbagh was the priority as water was fast seeping into the area. By this time, the water had almost reached the second floor of our house and my family and other residents of the locality had to move to the third floor. Around 5pm, while I was talking to my father, the call dropped. I tried calling several times before giving up.
Roads turn into rivers
My brother took a flight back home but the sheer force of water did not allow him to reach the family. “It’s like a gushing stream in Pahalgam,” he told me. He was just a kilometre away, watching helplessly.
My aunt was carried to the third floor of her house in Rajbagh area. She along with 25 relatives, including eight children, was crying for help. Amid distress calls to officials and reporting the PM’s visit, I got the news that our office was submerged as water had breached Lal Chowk. Meanwhile, my uncle hired a boat to rescue my aunt, refuting claims that Rajbagh was a priority.
Rowing over chinar tree tops, trying to locate my aunt’s house among the only visible shining roofs, my uncles managed to rescue their sister from the partly submerged third storey of the house. It was after 12 rounds in the small shikara that the 25 people could be brought out.
Cries still haunt
“It was traumatic. People were shouting for help but we became selfish and just wanted to rescue our own first,” said one of my uncles.
“By the time we finished it was dark and impossible to go back. I have not slept peacefully since then and will never forget those cries for help for the rest of my life,” he said.
While they were rescuing their sister, my uncles’ house too came under the flood waters near the Dal Lake. They, along with my aunt’s family, moved into a dargah on a hilltop, which seemed the only safe option.
Meanwhile, my brother and I sent messages to friends in Delhi asking them to try rescue helplines. The numbers flashed on news channels were not working. I lost contact with the world around Sunday midnight.
Rowing to safety
With no phone and internet, my brother decided to rescue our family himself. Managing to get a strong shikara around 2pm on Monday, he rowed 2km to reach the locality.
“I was the first one to reach area and heard cries for help from all sides,” he said.
My parents decided to stay back and let my sister-in-law and nephew take the shikara as it was small. After the boat reached them a second time, they let the neighbour’s children go. Around 30 people were stranded as there had been a death in their family.
Monday night passed as my father, a diabetic, and my mother, a hypertension patient with a heart condition, were forced to stay on in a half-submerged house in candlelight.
Relatives to the rescue
By Tuesday, my brother managed to reach our parents at 5pm and promised his neighbours that he would be back. Some asked for medicines, some for food and water.
While my relatives managed to rescue family members from two worst-affected areas of Srinagar with no help from the government, most people in the inundated areas are still without food, electricity and water. But for their families, many would not have made it to safety.
I am writing this piece without the knowledge whether it will reach the readers of the Hindustan Times. Yet I am writing my story with a hope that it will make it through the heartless waters of the Jhelum and strike a chord with the citizens of this country. We can together force the central and state governments to undertake real rescue operations and not just flash promos for television news channels.

Hamas Admits  Mistakes  During Gaza BattleHamas Admits 'Mistakes' During Gaza Battle
 | By                                                                HAMZA HENDAWI and JOSEF FEDERMAN

GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — Two weeks after the end of the Gaza war, there is growing evidence that Hamas militants used residential areas as cover for launching rockets at Israel, at least at times. Even Hamas now admits "mistakes" were made.
But Hamas says it had little choice in Gaza's crowded urban landscape, took safeguards to keep people away from the fighting, and that a heavy-handed Israeli response is to blame for the deaths of hundreds of Palestinian civilians.
"Gaza, from Beit Hanoun in the north to Rafah in the south, is one uninterrupted urban chain that Israel has turned into a war zone," said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official in Gaza.
Increasingly, the discussion is not about whether the Hamas rockets were fired from civilian areas, but exactly how close they were to the actual buildings.
"The Israelis kept saying rockets were fired from schools or hospitals when in fact they were fired 200 or 300 meters (yards) away. Still, there were some mistakes made and they were quickly dealt with," Hamad told The Associated Press, offering the first acknowledgment by a Hamas official that, in some cases, militants fired rockets from or near residential areas or civilian facilities.
The questions lie at the heart of a brewing international legal confrontation: Did Hamas deliberately and systematically fire rockets at Israel from homes, hospitals and schools in the hope that Israel would be deterred from retaliating, as Israel claims? Or did Israel use force excessively, resulting in deaths among people not involved in combat operations?
The answers could help determine whether Israel — or Hamas — or both are ultimately accused of violating the international laws of war in a conflict that caused tremendous damage.
According to Palestinian figures, nearly 2,200 Palestinians were killed — roughly three quarters of them civilians and including more than 500 children — and 11,000 were wounded. The war also left some 100,000 homeless. Seventy-two people were killed on the Israeli side, including six civilians.
Ahead of a U.N. investigation, the Israeli military has released reams of evidence, including satellite photos and aerial footage, to support its claims that it acted responsibly and attempted to minimize Palestinian casualties. It asserts that Hamas made no effort to disguise its attempt to maximize Israeli civilian casualties.
Throughout the war, the Israeli air force compiled dozens of video clips showing alleged wrongdoing by Hamas, an Islamic militant group sworn to Israel's destruction.
These videos, many of them posted on YouTube, appear to show rockets flying out of residential neighborhoods, cemeteries, schoolyards and mosque courtyards. There are also images of weapons caches purportedly uncovered inside mosques, and tunnels allegedly used by militants to scurry between homes, mosques and buildings.
"Hamas' excuses are outrageous, misleading and contrary to the evidence supplied by the IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) and the reality documented by international journalists on the ground in Gaza," said Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, an Israeli military spokesman.
But a black-and-white satellite image released by the Israeli military illustrates the difficulties in proving the point. The army says the image, taken of the Gaza City neighborhood of Sheikh Radwan, shows four rocket launch sites sitting next to a cluster of schools and a nearby residential neighborhood.
Such images, it says, are evidence that Hamas used built-up areas for cover — and carelessly exposed civilians to danger in Israeli retaliatory strikes. However, the image itself is grainy and shows no clear signs of rocket activity, though rocket launchers are often hidden underground. The army refused to say how it had made its conclusions.
A visit to the area this week found three separate military sites — possibly training grounds — slightly larger than football fields located close to the state schools.
The sites are mostly concealed from street view by barriers made of corrugated iron, but one bore the sign of Hamas' military wing, al-Qassam Brigades, while another bore the sign of the Islamic Jihad, a militant group allied with Hamas. The bases were deserted. Visible from the outside were human cutout figures and what appeared to be exercise hurdles.
There were no overt signs of rocket launchers or craters in the ground outside, though dirt appeared to have been disturbed either by some sort of blast or the work of heavy military-type trucks. There were pieces of mangled concrete scattered on the ground. The school buildings appeared untouched.
Hamas tightly restricts access to such facilities, and it was impossible for photographers to enter the sites. Israel confirmed the area was targeted in airstrikes.
Another location identified by the Israeli military as a rocket-launching site is in northern Gaza around the newly built Indonesian hospital. Immediately to the north of the two-story hospital and across the road to the west are two Hamas military facilities. Both stand in close proximity to residential homes. The hospital stands intact, while nothing is visible from inside the bases.
Hamad, the Hamas official, argued that many of the buildings shown in Israeli videos were either a safe distance from the rocket launchers or that the buildings had been kept vacant during the fighting.
The ground in Sheikh Radwan, for instance, lies some 150 meters (yards) away from the neighborhood, and the schools were empty for summer vacation.
During 50 days of fighting, many observers witnessed rocket launches from what appeared to be urban areas. One piece of video footage distributed by the AP, for instance, captured a launch in downtown Gaza City that took place in a lot next to a mosque and an office of the Hamas prime minister. Both buildings were badly damaged in subsequent Israeli airstrikes.
There was other evidence of Hamas having used civilian facilities: Early in the conflict, the U.N. agency that cares for Palestinian refugees announced that it discovered weapons stored in its schools as they stood empty during the summer.
"I don't think there's any doubt urban areas were used to launch rockets from in the Gaza Strip," said Bill Van Esveld, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. "What needs to be determined is how close to a populated building or a civilian area were those rocket launches."
The issue may never be conclusively settled as both sides voice competing narratives over their conduct in the deadliest and most ruinous of the three wars since Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007.
"Yes, Hamas and others may have used civilians as human shields, but was that consistent and widespread?" said Sami Abdel-Shafi, a Palestinian-American who represents the Carter Center in Gaza. "The question is whether Israel's response was proportionate."
The war erupted on July 8 when Israel launched a massive aerial bombardment of Gaza in response to weeks of heavy rocket fire by Hamas and other Gaza-based militant groups — part of an escalation that began with the killing by a Hamas cell of three Israeli teens in the West Bank.
The Israeli army says Hamas fired almost 4,000 rockets at Israel, including 600 from close to schools, mosques and other civilian facilities, and scores of mortar shells. Israel carried out some 5,000 airstrikes, in addition to using powerful artillery and gunship fire.
Frequently, Israeli arms struck hospitals, schools, homes, mosques, factories and office towers. Israel said the buildings had been used for cover by militant fighters, and that whenever possible, it provided warning to civilians that strikes on their buildings were coming.
Israel disputes the makeup of the Palestinian casualty figures, saying that nearly half the dead were militants.
Nevertheless, the death toll and number of civilian deaths have led to harsh condemnations of Israel and raised questions on the proportionality of Israel's response. In an apparent attempt to head off international investigations, the Israeli military said Wednesday it has opened criminal investigations into two high-profile cases involving Palestinian civilian casualties.
Hamas also has been sharply criticized for launching rockets aimed at Israeli cities and towns. Israel says its own civilian death toll would have been much higher had it not been for its rocket defenses.
The U.N. Human Rights Council has appointed a commission to look into the latest fighting. Its report is expected no sooner than March.

Religious differences are there  but India is no communal tinderboxprint
I recently returned from an extended stay in the United States on a fellowship programme and I must at the outset state that the Americans are, by and large, a very friendly and sociable people.
The ones I met were also quite politically correct. Therefore, I was surprised by a question put forth by a concerned American: “Do you think there might have been some positive outcomes of European colonial rule in India, what with its mission of ‘a white man’s burden’, such as keeping Hindus and Muslims from annihilating each other?” 
When confronted by my confounded look, the man asked: “But aren’t religious holocausts quite common in post-Independence India?”
That set me thinking. How did he get the impression that India is like Syria or Iraq? Honestly, though, one couldn’t blame him.
He reads Western press reports on India, written by clueless Western journalists — clueless because most of them haven’t bothered to learn an Indian language or live outside the bubble of anglicised-elite enclaves in India.
They frequently portray India as a communal tinderbox. These Western journalists garner their opinions with help from our elite English-language media, where secular as well as religious extremists have traditionally held a disproportionately loud voice: The former because they are insiders in this group and the latter because our English-language media loves a controversial copy.
Many of these secular-extremist journalists write searing articles on the massive religious violence in India. Words like ‘genocide’, ‘holocaust’ and ‘pogrom’ are bandied about freely.
The religious extremists, on the other hand, play up a sense of historical or communal hurt (depending on the religion of the target group) and relentlessly call for retribution.
Do these merchants of fear have a point? The corporate world has a dictum: In god we trust; for everything else, show me data. What do the numbers say about religious violence in India? Yes, we have had religious riots.
They have been human tragedies, no doubt about it. And we must learn how to crank up our administrative system to prevent these tragedies and to deliver speedy justice if they do occur.
We have had nearly 60 religious riots (incidents where more than five people have been killed) in India since the mid-1960s leading to a total death toll of over 13,000 (Source: Outlook).
I will repeat that they have been terrible tragedies. Also, in no manner do I mean to belittle the suffering of the victims of religious riots.
But were any of these riots holocausts, where millions have been killed? No.
A holocaust is what Adolf Hitler carried out in Germany (six million deaths in the 1940s), what Winston Churchill consciously precipitated in pre-Independence eastern-India (1.5 to 4 million deaths in the 1940s), the Partition riots (1 million deaths) or what Pakistan did in Bangladesh (1 to 3 million deaths in the 1970s) or what is happening in Syria right now (191,000 deaths and counting).
The Native American population was approximately 10 million in North America when Columbus famously landed. It was ultimately reduced to less than a million by the time the genocide stopped. Once again, without belittling the suffering of the victims of Indian religious riots, we need to be careful with the words we use.
Admittedly on an unrelated issue, according to the US Centers for Disease Control, in 2010 alone, there were over 30,000 gun-related deaths in the United States.
That single year’s gun-related death toll in the US is more than twice the total number of deaths in all the religious riots in India cumulatively in the last 50 years.
Now, I am not saying that everything is perfect in India. I am proud of my country, but pride should not blind us to our problems. There is indiscriminate killing taking place in India right now.
But it’s not happening due to religious violence. Five lakh female foetuses are illegally aborted annually in India ie 500,000 girls are killed in the womb every year.
This is 185,000% more than the annual deaths due to religious violence. Many more girl-children die from the systematic malnutrition that they are subjected to. Even when they grow up, Indian women suffer systemic harassment and violence.
It’s not just the government that oppresses them, but our entire society itself. If we want to save Indian lives, if we want to prevent a holocaust and gross injustice, this is where we need to focus. Across all religious/linguistic/caste/social segments, by far the most oppressed group in India today, is women.
It seems that scare-mongering about religion suits the purpose of our ‘secular’ and ‘religious’ extremists. I agree that religious differences are a problem; I would venture to add, it’s a global problem that the human species is grappling with.
But I seriously don’t think India is going to sink into a morass of religious violence. While some of our myriad communities may not be in perfect harmony with each other, we’ve learnt to co-exist, by and large, without resorting to mass violence.
For all the fearful words that are used to describe religious people in India, a vast majority of Indians are like you and me: Deeply religious, profoundly liberal and unwilling to kill for our faith.
The numbers prove that clearly. Sadly, we are not so non-violent when it comes to our girl-children and women.
If we truly love the idea of India, we should focus on the issue of women’s oppression, rather than attacking religion to assert our liberalism.
Sometimes, it’s better to let the data speak, rather than allowing fantastic prose to hog the limelight. You never know what agenda lies hidden beneath the prose.

NRI Investments in Indian Realty May Rise 35% in 2014: SurveyFree Diesel Prices at the Earliest: RBI Governor
New Delhi: Property developers are expecting a 35 per cent surge in real estate enquiries from NRIs (non-resident Indians) with Bangalore turning out to be a favourite, according to a survey by the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham).
To tap the growing interest, which comes at a time when the global economy is stabilising and India is showing strong signs of revival, real estate companies here are pulling out all the stops by conducting property shows, exhibitions and opening overseas representative offices.
Developers are also expanding their existing distribution chains and entering into strategic partnerships to encourage investors from this cash-rich segment, the industry body said.
The survey was conducted among nearly 850 real estate developers in Delhi-NCR, Chandigarh, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Pune, Dehradun, Chennai etc.
Bangalore was the most favourite property investment destination for NRIs, followed by Ahmedabad, Pune, Chennai, Goa, Delhi and Dehradun, the survey showed.
The enquiries are primarily coming from NRIs residing in the UAE, the US, Singapore, Australia, the UK, Canada and South Africa.
This year, demand is more for the high-end property and commercial buildings, developers say.
"With the revival in global economy, especially in the United States and Europe, people are more optimistic and looking for property to invest in."
"Both small and big developers are focusing on the NRI base in the US, the UK and Asia Pacific region this year," Assocham Secretary General D S Rawat said.
As per the findings of the survey, Ahemdabad (32 per cent) continued to be the most stable market in terms of demand and absorption of both residential and commercial spaces.
NRIs consider Ahmedabad as a safe place to invest in, with lenient government regulations for property investments. Pune was at the third position (30.5 per cent), as per the survey, whereas Chennai (28 per cent) was at the 4th spot and Goa (23 per cent) at the 5th place.
In Delhi, there has been a 21 per cent rise in enquiries this year as opposed to last year  and a majority of them have been for the residential segment.
Catering to the growing demand in the high-end segment, Delhi has also emerged among the promising markets for real estate, the survey showed.

Big investors lining up for Alibaba sharesBig investors lining up for Alibaba shares

Score one for Alibaba. The Chinese company’s IPO roadshow has won over investors – big time. Interest appears strong for the Chinese company’s shares — setting the stage for the deal to happen next week.
Demand for shares is so strong for the initial public offering investment bankers have sped up the process of setting the final price on the shares, says Francis Gaskins, a long-term IPO analyst at Equities.com. That’s a signal that not only will the USA’s largest initial public offering start trading next week — currently expected Sept. 19 — but perhaps at a higher than expected price approaching $70 a share, Gaskins says.
“There’s definitely a lot of investor interest,” says William Preston, research analyst at Renaissance Capital, which manages an IPO exchange-traded fund. “You might expect this deal to price at the high end (of the expected range) or above.”
There is demand for the shares that is twice if not higher than the shares available, according to IPO tracker John Fitzgibbon of IPOScoop.com.
The company’s initial prospectus indicated the IPO will sell 310.1 million shares at between $60 and $66 a share. The would generate proceeds of $20.2 billion or more. That would top Visa’s $17.9 billion IPO on March 18, 2008 as the biggest U.S. deal in history, Renaissance says.
Alibaba is continuing its North American roadshow, designed to allow investors to get more comfortable with the company and the deal. But it’s just a formality now as investors that’ve seen the presentation so far are signing on. Preston, who attended the New York stop of the roadshow this week, says that attendance was high. Investors indicate to Renaissance they’re interested in the deal.
There’s one group of big buyers that won’t be adding Alibaba, though: S&P 500 index funds. Late Friday, S&P Dow Jones Indices, the firm that manages the Standard & Poor’s 500, said that Alibaba would be classified as a Chinese domiciled firm. It would be included in global indexes, but not the S&P 500. That’s a potential source of upside taken away, since massive amounts of money are pegged to the S&P 500, and stocks often jump after it’s announced they’re being included in the index.
The question now is how aggressive the investment bankers will be with the pricing. With a deal of this size, the danger of pushing the initial price too high is a soft opening. That was the fate of Facebook, which boosted the initial price but then the shares struggled for months to get back above.

Govt to repurchase Rs 20 000-crore securitiesBank of India
(Finance Ministry also said…)
NEW DELHI: The government has announced the repurchase of Rs 20,000 crore worth of its securities through a reverse auction, citing a comfortable cash situation. The finance ministry also said indirect tax revenue growth accelerated to 9 per cent in August and may have improved the cash situation, which got a boost with the record Rs 53,000 crore dividend from Reserve Bank of India .
"The repurchase by the government of India will be undertaken to prematurely redeem the government stocks by utilising surplus cash balances," the finance ministry said in a statement on Friday.
A separate finance ministry release showed indirect tax growth picking up pace. Customs, excise and service tax collections were up 9 per cent in August compared with a 3.9 per cent rise in the April-July period. Though this is still well below the FY15 target, the higher growth suggests the economy could be picking up pace. Excise revenuerose 8 per cent in August.

Malala Yousafzai s attackers arrested: Pak armyMalala, then 15, was shot in her head by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) gunmen in October 2012 in northwestern Swat valley. (Source: IE archive)
Press Trust of India | Islamabad | Posted: September 12, 2014 6:46 pm | Updated: September 12, 2014 7:15 pm
The 10 Taliban militants who tried to kill Pakistani teenage activist Malala Yousafzai for her outspoken views on girls’ education in the country’s troubled northwest in 2012 have been arrested, the Pakistani army announced on Friday.
Malala, then 15, was shot in her head by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) gunmen in October 2012 in northwestern Swat valley.
She has since recovered from the assault , which shocked the world and catapulted her to international fame for her courageous and determined fight for education rights to all children.
Two other students were also injured in the attack.
Director General of Inter Services Public Relations (DG ISPR) Asim Saleem Bajwa said the 10 arrested militants have revealed that the mastermind of the attack on the schoolgirls was TTP commander Mullah Fazlullah.
“This was an intelligence-led operation, and police were also involved in the case,” Bajwa was quoted as saying by the Express Tribune.
Bajwa said the group of the arrested militants hail from Malakand, close to Mingora, the main town of Swat where Malala was attacked.
The arrests came as part of the Pakistani military’s ongoing all-out assault on the TTP and other militant outfits in North Waziristan.
Malala, after narrowly surviving the assassination bid, was taken to Britain with her family for treatment.
She now lives in Birmingham, where she was flown for specialist treatment after the shooting.
She came to public attention in 2009 when she wrote a diary for BBC Urdu about life under Taliban militants who had taken control of the valley.
The teenage activist was named one of Time magazine’s most influential persons of 2013 , and was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. She has also released an autobiography recently.

White House makes it official; US  at war  w...White House makes it official; US 'at war' with Islamic State
AFP Sep 13, 2014, 09.26AM IST
(In a series of television…)
WASHINGTON: The White House declared Friday the United States was at war with Islamic State radicals, seeking to rub out another semantic flap over its Syria policy.
In a series of television interviews Secretary of State John Kerry had appeared to be reluctant to term the expansion of US operations against IS in Iraq and Syria as "war."
But pressed to clear up doubts about how President Barack Obama sees the conflict, the White House and Pentagon left little doubt.
"The United States is at war with ISIL in the same way that we are at war with Al-Qaeda and its Al-Qaeda affiliates all around the globe," said White House spokesman Josh Earnest.
Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said that the US was not fighting the last Iraq war and used similar language to Earnest.
"But make no mistake, we know we are at war with ISIL in the same way we're at war and continue to be at war with Al-Qaida and its affiliates," he said.
Obama is scheduled to be in Tampa, Florida Wednesday to receive a briefing from top commanders at US Central Command, which oversees American forces in the Middle East.
In interviews on Thursday, as Kerry toured the Middle East building an anti-IS coalition, he was reluctant to use the term "war" in referring to the US campaign, telling people not to indulge in "war fever."
"We're engaged in a major counterterrorism operation, and it's going to be a long-term counterterrorism operation," Kerry told CBS News.
"I think 'war' is the wrong terminology and analogy but the fact is that we are engaged in a very significant global effort to curb terrorist activity," Kerry said.
The dispute over wording may seem trivial when American planes and drones have been pounding Islamic State targets in Iraq for weeks in more than 160 operations.
But it indicates the administration is skittish about using language that could alarm Americans weary of years of foreign conflict and who embraced Obama's vow to "end" the US wars in Afghanistan and Iraq during two presidential election campaigns.
"The first thing that's important for people to understand is the president has made clear how the strategy that he is pursuing in Iraq and Syria to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL is different than the strategy that was pursued in the previous Iraq War," said Earnest on Friday.
Obama's new strategy, announced in a prime-time televised address on Wednesday, expands US air strikes in Iraq against IS and envisages new action against the group in Syria.
In addition, Obama plans to train "moderate" Syrian rebels to take on IS and to reconstitute the Iraqi army, parts of which fled an IS blitzkreig across northern and western Iraq.
But he has insisted that there will be no deployments of US ground troops in the operation -- especially none that would recall the vast US land armies that were targeted by insurgents in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The debate over the word "war" is only the latest verbal kerfuffle to hamper Obama's attempts to clarify his increasingly under-fire foreign policy.
Two weeks ago, the president sparked a political storm by admitting he did not "yet" have a strategy for combating IS in Syria after the beheading of two US journalists.
Critics also accused the administration of seeking to "manage" the problem of Al-Qaeda rather than seeking to decimate it.
On Wednesday, Obama said that his goal was to "destroy" IS.

New Delhi, September 12:  
Global auto majors, including General Motors and Honda, on Friday said the Government should remove ‘obstacles’ and have policies that are more business friendly if India is to successfully achieve Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Make in India’ goal.
They highlighted issues ranging from difficulty in getting business permits to taxation, infrastructure and logistics problems, which they said are hurdles in the growth of the auto industry.
“There are a number of obstacles to doing business in this country. We hope such obstacles will be cleared away under the new leadership of Prime Minister Modi,” Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) Chairman Fumihiko Ike said, while addressing the convention.
Ike, who is also the Chairman of Honda Motor Co, said many Japanese auto parts suppliers “are anxious to establish operations in this country” but face problems.
Nissan Motor Company Senior VP and Chairman for Africa, Middle East and India Takashi Hata said: “Simplify the vendor duty drawback scheme. This (India) is not the easiest country to get this.”
Expressing similar views, General Motors Executive Vice-President Stefan Jacoby said: “To realise the full potential of the industry, we encourage the government to reform overall Central and State taxation policies in a timely manner.”

10 ways to unclog Delhi: L-G Jung accepts HT s suggestionsComments
Delhi L-G Najeeb Jung has promised to implement suggestions made by Hindustan Times to decongest the Capital’s crowded streets and choked arterial roads.
Hindustan Times, which has been running a campaign to unclog Delhi, presented a 10-point agenda to Jung on Friday.
The agenda, ‘10 ways to Unclog Delhi’, was prepared by HT with the help of experts on urban transport and mobility. Suggestions made by HT’s readers were also factored in.
 
Receiving the document, Jung said: “Delhi is grateful to HT for this initiative. The issues you have raised concern the very life of this city. We as an administration shall take forward your ideas and initiatives.”
Last week, HT had invited well-known urban transport and mobility experts to its office and discussed the reasons behind perennial traffic snarls on arterial and radial roads and the possible solutions to de-choke them.
The experts suggested several short-term and long-term measures, including strengthening public transport, improving last-mile connectivity, removing encroachments and illegal parking, implementing a better traffic management system, promoting cycling and motivating motorists to use public transport.
They suggested that a study be carried out to understand the present and future mobility needs of Delhi, based on which practical solutions could be worked out.
The panel of experts comprised former DDA commissioner AK Jain, advisor to Centre for Science and Environment and former UTTIPEC director Ashok Bhattacharjee, head of the department of transport planning at School of Planning and Architecture PK Sarkar, associate professor at SPA Dr Sewa Ram, ITDP director Nalin Sinha and principal scientist with Central Road Research Institute Dr K Ravinder.

Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit set to usher in $100 billion

China President Xi's India Visit
(Jinping will land in Modi's…)
MUMBAI: Chinese president Xi Jinping will bring along with him $100 billion or Rs 6 lakh crore of investment commitments over five years during his upcoming India visit next week.
This is nearly thrice the $35 billion secured by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his Japan trip.
Jinping will land in Modi's home state Gujarat on September 17 — the Prime Minister's birthday — following his visit of Tajikistan, Maldives and Sri Lanka.
Confirming this, Liu Youfa, China's consul-general in Mumbai, told TOI, "On a conservative estimate, I can say that we will commit investments of over $100 billion or thrice the investments committed by Japan during our President Xi Jinping's visit next week. These will be made in setting up of industrial parks, modernization of railways, highways, ports, power generation, distribution and transmission, automobiles, manufacturing, food processing and textile industries."
The consul-general's statements coincide with Modi's call for world class infrastructure projects after his review of major infrastructure sectors on Friday. The government also announced new projects worth Rs 9 lakh crore in energy, power, and roads.
China will initially invest $7 billion in industrial parks in Pune and Gandhinagar. "The Pune industrial park — spread across 5 square kilometres with an investment of $5 billion — will be for automobiles that will employ one lakh people and manufacture 1.5 lakh speciality vehicles. The Gujarat industrial park will be for manufacturing power equipment. China is also working on setting up an industrial park in Tamil Nadu for the textile sector and another one for the food processing sector," said Liu.
China is willing to invest another $50 billion in roads, ports and the NDA government's ambitious river-linking plan. "India has over 600 reservoirs that need dredging work to provide better irrigation systems for the farmers. We are looking to work on that. Besides, our major thrust will be on construction of roads and ports," said Liu.
On Friday, road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari announced the launch of new roads and highways projects this year worth Rs 2 lakh crore.
Power minister Piyush Goyal said that $100 billion of investments are likely to flow into India's renewable sector in the next four years. Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan, while meeting Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik, said that Odisha alone will receive about Rs 1 lakh crore worth of investment in the next five years in petrochemicals, oil & gas pipelines, LNG & LPG terminals, and strategic oil reserves to make it the 'energy gateway for eastern India.
The Chinese president is coming with a delegation of over 100 business heads, including those from China Harbour, China Railway Construction Group and Huawei, among others, and will address a business gathering of over 400 Indian CEOs in Delhi.
The big four Chinese banks — Bank of China, Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), China Construction Bank and the Agriculture Bank of China — are also coming with the delegation to give billions of dollars in loans to Indian infrastructure projects to be done in joint venture with Chinese firms.
"All major JV projects will be funded by Chinese banks. Major corporate houses like Tatas, Infosys, Reliance and Essar have already taken loans from these banks and the funding will only increase," said Liu.

Goa Govt to augment water supply capacityGoa Govt to augment water supply capacity

Panaji, Sept 13:  
The Goa Government has announced that it will augment the water supply capacity and also replace an age-old pipeline criss-crossing 1,000-kilometre stretch at a cost of Rs 345 crore to reduce the quantum of non-revenue water.
State Public Works Department Minister Ramakrishna Dhavalikar told reporters here that the Central Government has given in-principle nod for the project.
“The formal proposal would be placed before the Union Government’s committee during the meeting scheduled on September 25,” Dhavalikar said.
The minister said that such a measure would reduce the quantum of non-revenue water, which has currently reached an alarming level of 40-50 per cent.
He said a special cell comprising 25 engineers has been assigned the job of curbing the percentage of non-revenue water.
“The special cell was formed three months back and we are sure that all the measures would help us to reduce the non-revenue water up to 20 per cent by next year,’’ he said conceding that majority of revenue losses are created due to NRW.
Dhavalikar said that the State Government is working to provide round-the-clock water supply to all parts of Goa by December 2016 through a Japanese agency-funded project.
He said work on projects dealing with water augmentation will be complete by March 2015.

Gurdwara a symbol of communal harmony in flood-hit SrinagarAmid anger and hostility, there are heart-warming stories of communal harmony coming out of flood-ravaged Srinagar.

The Shahid Bunga Gurdwara in Burzulla area of the city has emerged as a major relief centre for people who have been affected by the devastating floods in the Kashmir valley.
Mohammad Amin and Nazeer Ahmed from Allauchi Bagh are among over 1,500 Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs and Ladakhis who have registered at the control room set up within the gurdwara for food, shelter, medicines and being transported to the airport or to safer areas of Srinagar.
J-K floods: Golden Temple responds to Omar’s SOS, sends food packets
Twelve-year-old Javed’s home at Chaanapura in Srinagar is still under water but his mother has been able to cook for the family at a relative's house with rations from the gurdwara.
Nearly 120 school students, who were in Srinagar to take part in various tournaments, also took shelter at the gurdwara for five days till they could be flown back home.

And lending them helping hands are people like Bikram Singh, a bank employee, and KN Singh, a lecturer, who are enrolling the flood victims.
A local transporter Dara Singh is ferrying people to the airport and carrying food and medicines while retired paediatrician Dr Pritam Singh and Dr JP Singh have been tending patients in the library of the gurdwara which is now being used as a medical camp.
"The first day of this week, we had just 250 patients. Now, we are catering to nearly 800 to 1,000 a day, providing them with insulin injections, medicines for diarrohea, hypertension and gastroenteritis," said Dr Pritam Singh.
The rush at the gurdwara has forced the committee to pull the shutters down after the langar hall filled to capacity and offer food in batches.
But what stands out is the gurdwara committee’s decision to shift the holy Guru Granth Sahib to a smaller room so that flood victims can sleep in the main hall.

Gujarat bypolls: 7.01% voter turnout in first 2 hoursGujarat bypolls: 7.01% voter turnout in first 2 hours

Ahmedabad, Sept 13:  
Polling is being held today for by-election to nine Assembly seats and Vadodara Lok Sabha constituency, vacated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
According to the Election Commission, 7.01 per cent people cast their franchise till 9 a.m.
Vadodara Lok Sabha seat, where by-election was necessitated as Prime Minister Narendra Modi vacated the seat after winning with a huge margin, witnessed 5.76 per cent voter turnout till 9 a.m.
The nine Assembly seats, where the polling is underway, are Maninagar, Anand, Limkheda, Deesa, Matar, Talaja, Tankara, Khambhalia and Mangrol.
About 4.44 per cent voter turnout was registered for the Assembly seat of Deesa in Banaskantha; Maninagar recorded 3.67 per cent in Ahmedabad city, Tankara 14.37 per cent in Rajkot, Khambhalia 10.99 per cent in Jamnagar, Mangrol 10.5 per cent, Talaja 9.5 per cent in Junagadh, Anand 7.54 per cent in Anand district and Limkheda registered 6.25 per cent.
About 45 candidates are in the fray for the Assembly seats and four for the Vadodara Lok Sabha seat.
By-polls were necessitated on these seats as sitting BJP MLAs resigned from their posts after winning the Lok Sabha election, including Modi, who also vacated Maninagar seat as sitting MLA.
Though all these seats were earlier held by BJP, Congress is hoping to make a dent this time by leveraging the absence of Modi in Gujarat.
The elections are also seen as a litmus test for Chief Minister Anandi Patel, who along with local BJP leaders, held whirlwind campaigns in all nine seats in the last one week.
Maninagar constituency, which was represented by Modi thrice when he served as Gujarat’s Chief Minister, witnessed a tepid voter turnout of only 3.6 per cent in the first two hours.
Elsewhere also, including Vadodara Lok Sabha seat, less number of voters ventured to cast their voters during the early hours of voting.
The counting of votes will be conducted on September 17.

Thiruvananthapuram, Sept 13:  
The Bankers’ Training Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, will organise a mock interview programme for banking job aspirants here on September 20 and 21.
This is being done with a view to providing aspirants with a clear edge in recruitment, says Salim Gangadharan, Chairman of the centre.
Expert staff
Details of the programme are available on http://www.bankerstrainingcentre.in. Candidates can also contact on telephone 9446565611/8547605515/0471-2726200.
The centre has been established by a group of senior bankers and senior managers who have over three decades of experience.
Gangadharan is a former Regional Director of the Reserve Bank of India. He says that the centre has plans to grow into a distinct and dynamic training institution of excellence.
It proposes to carve a niche in the finance industry in South India. It will conduct various relevant training and studies to prospective and current bank and financial service employees. With a view to adding to national skill building, the centre proposes to instil national and global competencies in aspirants to serve key sectors of the economy.
“Our team is geared to provide academic and practical training skills and advanced knowledge, in subject areas which concern financial institutions”, he says.
In its innovative model, the centre plans to offer a continuum of learning services to provide a full range of adult upgrading and professional education.

The single biggest challenge facing candidates today is how to be successful at the interview, says Gangadharan.
“Job interviews provide a short duration opportunity and there cannot be any margin for error,” he points out.
“Candidates in Kerala need support in developing skills. Even those who do well in written and aptitude tests seem to falter in oral communication.
“Our experienced team of specialists will provide candidates with honest feedback and a clear indication of the areas where they need to focus to improve their performance.”

Fed Change Unlikely to Blunt Equities  Appeal Over BondsGold, Silver Rebound on Global Cues
New York:
The recent wobbly stretch in both stocks and bonds may persist for the short term if the US Federal Reserve next week lives up to expectations and signals the days of near-zero interest rates are numbered, but it is unlikely to tip valuation scales in favor of bonds any time soon.
Anxiety over the two-day Fed policy meeting, centered on expectations the central bank will likely drop its pledge to keep interest rates low for a "considerable time," was a primary driver behind stocks snapping a five-week winning streak this week and bonds absorbing their steepest losses in at least two months.
Top economists at several firms say they see at least even odds the Fed will nix the phrase from its forward guidance, which some traders may interpret as meaning that rate hikes could come as early as next March.
"If investors feel the Fed is becoming more hawkish, that's actually a negative for all asset classes with the exception of the dollar," said Chris Gaffney, senior market strategist at EverBank Wealth Management in St. Louis, Missouri.
Still, few expect such a move would translate immediately into a long-term change in investors' bullish view of stocks, especially relative to bonds.
To be sure, signs of sooner-than-expected interest rate hikes could chip away at investors' optimistic view of stocks, which scaled to new heights in no small part thanks to the Fed's quantitative easing program and decision to hold interest rates near zero percent for nearly six years now.
But with bond yields still extraordinarily low by historic standards, and unlikely to rise drastically, many investors see equities as one of their few prospects for long-term growth.
Market watchers say it is unlikely the prospect of interest rate hikes will significantly dampen investors' taste for stocks or prompt a large-scale reallocation of funds into bonds.
"There's no doubt that there will be some volatility in the short term, but at some point equilibrium will come into the market," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.
While measures such as the forward price-to-earnings ratio on the S&P 500 suggest stocks are their priciest in nearly a decade, other measures of relative valuation to bonds remain skewed in favor of equities.
The S&P's so-called earnings yield, the inverse of the price/earnings ratio and a common yard stick for comparing equity valuations against bonds, is roughly 6.3 per cent. That is 3.7 percentage points higher than the 10-year Treasury yield, currently 2.6 per cent, whereas the long-term spread between the two is about 1.5 percentage points.
When measured against corporate junk bonds, the bond market's biggest competitor to stocks for asset flow, valuation math is tilted even more heavily in favor of equities. The average yield to maturity on junk bonds is just 6.3 per cent, according to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch fixed income index data, but the long-term average junk yield is 9.4 per cent.
Moreover, US corporate earnings are projected to resume double-digit growth in coming quarters, according to Thomson Reuters data, which would keep a lid on P/E multiple expansion, perhaps even compress it if profit growth outpaces stock price increases.
That suggests stocks remain the better bet for returns, at least until interest rates rise significantly enough to return relative valuation measures between the two to historic norms.
In the current market environment, "There's not really a better alternative to stocks right now," says Gaffney.

Brisk voting in 3 Lok Sabha  33 assembly seats; will Modi magic work for BJPComments
Brisk voting was recorded in most of the 33 assembly seats and 3 Lok Sabha seats where bypolls were held on Saturday.
In Uttar Pradesh voting percentage was highest  in Mainpuri Lok Sabha constituency, which was vacated by Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh. Mulayam's grandnephew Tej Pratap Singh Yadav, 27, is contesting the seat on an SP ticket.
Among the voters was chief minister Akhilesh Yadav who landed in Saifai to cast his ballot.
Lack of enthusiasm was witnessed among the voters in the first two hours in all the constituencies, but slowly picked up later. By 3 pm around 44 % had cast their votes. Mild rains also affected the voter turnout.
The Mainpuri seat was held by SP, while all the eleven Assembly seats where voting is on were held by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
In West Bengal voting was brisk in Basirhat Dakshin while Chowringhee had lower voter turnout. Both the Left and the BJP accused the ruling TMC of terrorising voters, BJP's Basirhat candidate Samik Bhatatcharya said.
Over 62% polling was recorded in Basirhat Dakshin while nearly 40% voters exercised their franchise in Chowringhee  till 2 pm.
Voting was also brisk and peaceful in Telangana, Rajasthan and other states where bypolls are held.
Analysts are looking to see which way the wind blows in the bypolls spread across these nine states.
The results of two Lok Sabha seats — Vadodara which was vacated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Medak in Telangana was vacated by Telangana Rashtra Samithi chief and chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao — are unlikely to throw any surprises. But Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav’s prestige is at stake in his home turf Mainpuri, the third Lok Sabha seat.
The bypolls are being seen as an indicator of the popularity of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and opposition parties ahead of four assembly elections to be held this year.
They also pose a key question on the future of the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in Uttar Pradesh.
The BJP swept to power on the back of a so-called Modi wave this summer, but failed to maintain the momentum in last month’s by-elections in four states where it lost a majority of seats to the Congress party and its allies.
The BJP and its allies together won only eight of the 18 seats that went to the polls while the Congress and its allies won 10.
In the last Lok Sabha polls, a large number of OBCs and Dalits rallied behind the BJP across the Hindi belt. The shift dented the SP and BSP’s support base in the largest electoral state. The SP won just seven seats while Mayawati’s BSP drew a blank.
The grand alliance of the RJD-JDU-Congress could halt the BJP’s charge into this caste base. In the absence of such an alliance in Uttar Pradesh, any further losses may lead to an existential crisis for the two caste-based parties.
If the opposition parties — especially the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress in Rajasthan, Gujarat and Assam — can stop the BJP’s march, their claim about the Modi wave waning will receive a further boost.
With elections in Maharashtra and Haryana due next month, any by-election victory will also give the beleaguered Congress a fresh face saver after its humiliating Lok Sabha defeat.
But it may not be so easy for the opposition. Of the 33 seats, 11 are in Uttar Pradesh where the BJP swept 71 of 80 Lok Sabha seats.
In Gujarat and Rajasthan, where 13 assembly seats are up for grabs, the opposition could not even open its account in the general election.
Three seats are heading for the polls in Congress-ruled Assam where the BJP bagged 50% of Lok Sabha constituencies.
In West Bengal, the ruling Trinamool Congress will be desperate to win both seats as it wants to show that the Saradha scam has not hurt the party’s prospects.
For the BJP, a win or even a number two position in the results from Assam and Bengal will further cement its position as a fast emerging force, replacing traditional opposition parties like AGP and Left, respectively.
The by-elections in Chhattisgarh, Sikkim, Andhra and Tripura will test if the ruling parties can further consolidate their positions. Tripura is the only state where the Left is in power.

Pfizer  Ranbaxy win dismissal of lawsuit over generic cholesterol drugLipitorThe lawsuit was filed in 2012 by retailers and distributors that bought Lipitor directly from Pfizer. (Reuters)
Reuters | Posted: September 13, 2014 3:17 pm
Pfizer Inc and India’s Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd on Friday won dismissal of an antitrust lawsuit accusing them of conspiring to delay sales of generic versions of the cholesterol drug Lipitor, the best-selling drug in history.
U.S. District Judge Peter Sheridan in Trenton, New Jersey ruled that the plaintiffs, retailers and distribution companies that bought Lipitor directly from Pfizer, failed to plead their case with enough detail.
The lawsuit was filed in 2012 by retailers and distributors that bought Lipitor directly from Pfizer.
The lawsuit stems from a 2008 settlement of a patent lawsuit filed by Pfizer against Ranbaxy over Ranbaxy’s plan to make generic Lipitor. Under the deal, Pfizer agreed to drop a claim for damages against Ranbaxy, and Ranbaxy agreed to stay out of the Lipitor market until November 2011.
Retailers and distribution companies claim that the settlement amounted to Pfizer paying Ranbaxy to stay out of the Lipitor market, violating antitrust laws. But Sheridan ruled Friday that their case failed because they did not offer any allegation of the settlement’s dollar value.
Sheridan dismissed another version of the lawsuit last September.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs and a Pfizer spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment.

Hero MotoCorp hunting for battery maker to power electricplansHero MotoCorp, along with its technical partners, has developed several new two-wheeler concepts.
Posted: September 13, 2014 3:10 pm
Hero MotoCorp is looking at acquiring or tying up with battery makers of electric two-wheelers for access to latest technologies as it develops electric bikes and hybrid scooters for markets like the US and Europe.
Pawan Munjal, vice-chairman, MD & CEO of Hero MotoCorp, said, “This is on my mind. We are looking at tie-ups and acquisitions, especially on the battery side. We are almost ready with our hybrid scooter Leap, but are yet to finalise the launch plans, and we are also working on an electric bike called SimpliCity.”
Hero MotoCorp, along with its technical partners, has developed several new two-wheeler concepts, including the RNT diesel-hybrid bike it showcased earlier this year. Last year, the company announced a Rs 450-crore investment for its own R&D facility near Jaipur to develop products from the ground up — it was earlier prevented from doing so under its JV with Honda, which ended in 2011.
Munjal said the company will launch its vehicles in the crucial US market around June 2016. “We have already sent our vehicles for homologation (a process of market certification) in the US. We would set up our distribution, but are undecided on branding,” he said.
Back home, Hero will start production at its 1.8-million-units-per-year fifth plant in Gujarat by October-December 2015 while it is also talking to various southern states for a sixth plant. Hero’s domestic output is currently 7.65 million units.
 

Gujarat bypoll: Complaint against Congress candidates for codebreachPress Trust of India | Ahmedabad | Posted: September 13, 2014 3:08 pm
Gujarat BJP on Saturday filed a complaint and sought action against Congress candidates from Maninagar and Anand assembly seats, where by-elections are underway, for alleged violation of the poll code.
“BJP has filed complaint against Congress candidates Jatin Kella from Maninagar assembly seat and Kanti Sodha from Anand assembly seat for violating poll code as they were wearing scarf with Congress’ election symbol on it when they went to vote,” BJP state unit spokesperson Harshad Patel said.
The complaint was filed before the Election Commission seeking legal action against both the candidates, Patel added. Voting is underway in one Lok Sabha constituency and nine assembly seats in Gujarat.
The by-polls were necessitated on these seats as sitting BJP MLAs resigned from their posts after winning the recent Lok Sabha elections. Maninagar assembly seat was vacated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi after he emerged victorious from Lok Sabha seats in Gujarat (Vadodara) and Uttar Pradesh (Varanasi).
Vadodara Lok Sabha seat is witnessing by-poll today as it was also vacated by Modi after he preferred Varanasi over the constituency in his home-town.

Those who claimed achche din drifted to love jihad : UPCMPress Trust of India | Etawah (up) | Posted: September 13, 2014 2:53 pm
Attacking the BJP, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday said those who had promised “achche din” have now lost their way to “love jihad” and asserted that people are extending support to the ruling Samajwadi Party in the bypolls.
“The forces which had claimed ‘achche din aayenge (good days are to come)’ have now drifted and lost their way to love jihad,” he said.
The Chief Minister, who cast his vote here in the Mainpuri Lok Sabha bypoll, said, “I think people are supporting us…”
“The forces which had taken help of wrong propaganda and made promises have not been able to fulfil them in 100 days,” he said.
Yadav said people and the state want good roads, water, health services, employment and social and economic development.
The chief minister said he has already written several letters to the Centre for road, power and other requirements of the state.
“UP gave them (BJP) maximum seats and so should also get its share… has it got it, you should analyse it, people are also analysing it,” Yadav told reporters.

Stagnant water pools and unsanitary conditions in a plant being constructed by Tata Steel  Ltd in Odisha led to a dengue fever outbreak which infected more than 280 workers, killing one of them, a government official said on Friday.
Tata Steel, a unit of India's Tata conglomerate, is building a six-million-tonne-capacity plant in Jajpur district that is due to be completed by 2015.
Jajpur district's chief health official said the environment within the 1,700-acre building site was unclean, creating a breeding ground for mosquitoes which spread the virus.
"One death and 284 cases are linked to the Tata plant," Debendra Kumar Jena told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, adding that the outbreak began in July.
Dengue is common in India and cases generally peak in October, a peak time for mosquitoes to breed after the end of the monsoon rains.
The virus, which occurs mainly in the tropics, causes symptoms such as fever, severe headache, joint and muscular pains, vomiting and rashes.
Tata Steel said in a statement it had dispatched 19 teams to clean up the site and raise awareness among employees about how to protect themselves from dengue, malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases.
"Dengue is a problem at this time of the year. There are 40,000 people working on the Kalinga Nagar site. I am sorry to hear some people have contracted dengue. We are doing all that required from our side," TV Narendran, managing director of Tata Steel India, told local television.
Tata Steel stock price
On September 15, 2014, Tata Steel closed at Rs 507.55, down Rs 9.5, or 1.84 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 578.60 and the 52-week low was Rs 266.15.
The company's trailing 12-month (TTM) EPS was at Rs 75.41 per share as per the quarter ended June 2014. The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was 6.73. The latest book value of the company is Rs 629.60 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company is 0.81.

Vodafone also said as directed by DoT, it is providing 60 minutes free calls per day for 5 days for all customers in Kashmir. (Photo: Reuters)
Even as telecom services are being restored in Kashmir Valley, mobile operators are offering free calling facility in the region.
Telecom operators including BSNL, Airtel , Vodafone and Reliance Communications (RCom) will offer free calling facility for a limited period in the Valley.
"Starting yesterday, free calling facility for 60 minutes per day has been extended to all Airtel customers in Kashmir for the next 5 days enabling them to reach out to their loved ones," Airtel said in a statement.
Vodafone also said as directed by DoT , it is providing 60 minutes free calls per day for 5 days for all customers in Kashmir.
State-run BSNL said it will offer free calls(local as well as STD) and free SMS service to all those BSNL customers who will be using its mobile network in Srinagar.
BSNL said not only those customers who belong to that area but also the BSNL customers from other states of North Zone reaching Srinagar area for relief and rescue operations will be able to make free calls.
The facility has already been made available since night of September 11, 2014 and will continue for next 10 days, it said.
"There are no retailers or points where from people can get their accounts topped up. BSNL has, therefore decided to help people in that area by providing free call and SMS service with immediate effect," BSNL Board Director Anupam Shrivastava said.
RCom is offering free calls at its PCOs at relief camps and the duration of each call is fixed at 3 minutes.
Aircel had also offered free calling for its customers on September 10 and 11. But now the operator is not offering free calls.

Polling begins for bypolls in West BengalPrint
Press Trust of India | Kolkata | Posted: September 13, 2014 12:11 pm | Updated: September 13, 2014 5:22 pm
Over 62 per cent polling was recorded in Basirhat Dakshin while nearly 40 per cent voters exercised their franchise in Chowringhee assembly constituency here till 2 PM.
CPI(M) state secretary Biman Bose alleged that the party’s booth camp office at Sealdah area under Chowringhee constituency was attacked by TMC activists in which some party workers including two women were injured.
State Chief Electoral Officer Sunil Gupta when asked said a minor scuffle had taken place and the matter has been taken care of by the security personnel.
Election Commission sources said Basirhat Dakshin in North 24 Paraganas district recorded 62.8 per cent polling, while it was 39 per cent in Chowringhee constituency.
Trinamool Congress has fielded Nayna Bandyopadhyay, wife of party leader in Lok Sabha Sudip Bandyopadhyay, from Chowringhee seat while BJP has put up Ritesh Tiwari. Santosh Pathak is the Congress candidate and Faiyaz Ahmed Khan is the CPI(M) nominee from the seat.
Former footballer Dipendu Biswas is Trinamool candidate while BJP has fielded Samik Bhattacharya. Asit Majumder and Mrinal Chakrabarty are contesting from Basirhat Dakshin as Congress and CPI(M) candidates respectively.

iPhone 6 Plus pre-order shipments delayed | Didn t copy Samsung: Tim CookMany customers will have to wait three to four weeks to get their hands on Apple Inc's larger screen iPhone 6 Plus after pre-orders for Sept. 19 delivery were booked out within hours
ET SPECIAL:
ET Special: All you want to know about Apple iPhone 6
Customers may have to wait three to four weeks to get their hands on Apple Inc's iPhone 6 Plus, after a record number of orders for the company's latest smartphones strained available supply.
The new iPhone 6 goes on sale on Sept. 19 in the United States but the company began taking online orders on Thursday. While the larger 5.5-inch "Plus" models now display a wait time of up to a month, the 4.7-inch version remains available for delivery on September 19, Apple's website showed.
Verizon Wireless , AT&T and Sprint Corp , also showed shipment delays of up to six weeks on their respective websites. Apple said the pace of orders has so far outstripped any of its previous iPhones.
"Response to iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus has been incredible, with a record number of pre-orders overnight. Pre-orders are currently available online or through the Apple Store App," spokeswoman Trudy Muller said.
Apple routinely grapples with iPhone supply constraints, particularly in years that involve a smartphone re-design. The latest iPhones come with larger screens and some analysts had anticipated that production issues may keep a lid on initial runs.
Its suppliers had scrambled to get enough screens ready because the need to redesign a key component had disrupted panel production, supply chain sources told Reuters last month.
It was unclear whether the hiccup could limit the number of phones available to consumers, the sources said at the time. Apple declined to comment on supply chain issues.
In addition, Chinese customers may also have to wait until the year-end before they can buy the iPhone 6. Apple is yet to set a release date for China, the world's biggest smartphone market.
The company unveiled its latest iPhones along with a watch and a mobile payments service on Tuesday.
AT&T's chief executive of mobile and business, Ralph de la Vega, told investors at a conference in New York that iPhone 6 orders have so far surpassed orders last year and the year before.
"It is such a great thing to wake up in the morning to know that you have hundreds of thousands of orders already before you even have a cup of coffee," said the executive.
Apple's iPhones tend to incite the kind of initial buying frenzy unknown to many other brands, partly because of the company's well-honed marketing tactics.
On secondary markets online, the rights to a pre-ordered iPhone 6 Plus are worth as much as double the unsubsidized sticker price. One eBay auction for an unlocked 128-gigabyte gold version of the 5.5-inch phone, for example, was bidding at $1,625 on Friday afternoon, compared with a face value of $949.
One post on the New York City edition of Craigslist sought $10,000 the privilege to "be one of the first & few people to own this model and before the rest of the world."
New iPhones tend to get listed at stratospheric prices on various online retail sites from the United States to China, on the assumption that there's big demand from people who must get their hands on the phone from day one. That in turns fuels a grey market of dealers who buy in bulk for resale.

(The 2008 acquisition of…)
AHMEDABAD: Twelve years ago, Symphony Limited declared itself sick and got registered with the Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction, an agency to chart out sick companies' revival.
The makers of India's first branded coolers tasted runaway success in the late eighties and nineties when air-conditioners were only for the top-tier of the consuming class. But it could not hold on to the spiralling growth. By 2002, the net worth had eroded and the stock turned a penny stock (80 paise in September 2004).
It was then when the never-say-die Gujarati spirit took over. In 2008, Symphony Ltd, still under BIFR, made its first acquisition overseas and chairman Achal Bakeri found his way forward. Today, at 54, Bakeri is a happy man. The penny stock has scaled its way back and grown to be a proud member of large cap category on Friday.
"On Friday, from Rs 2.80 crore a decade ago, we have now crossed market capitalisation of Rs 5,000 crore," says Mr Bakeri, who also announced setting up of a manufacturing unit in the Kandla Special Economic Zone . The reserves and surplus stand at Rs 268.84 crore (June, 2014).
The 2008 acquisition of Mexico's Impco Air Coolers, a company that patented Evaporative Cooling technology , marked the turnaround. In 2009, the company came out of BIFR and changed its strategy.
"We changed from multi-product and single-market strategy to a multi-market and single-product one," says Nrupesh Shah, executive director at Symphony.The focused strategy also entails a business model of outsourcing manufacturing for domestic market and using own factories only for the exports. As a result, ithas managed a compounded annual growth of 34% in sales and 30% in net profit. Last year, the company issued 650% dividend to its shareholders.
Once on the brink of bankruptcy, the company now sells 5.5 lakh air cooler in the country and 1.5 lakh units abroad. It has posted a net profit of Rs 105.72 crore on a turnover of Rs 532.42 crore. Today, it's 100% debt free and cash rich, a comfort feeling it wants to take to its customers.

F&O mkt improves as NSE VIX trades at all-time lowF&O market
(NSE VIX — volatility index…)
MUMBAI: Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) consider their Indian market investments to be the safest with very little downside risks, as derivatives option protection bought by FIIs to circumvent their equity portfolio from any market decline hit multi-year lows, indicating near absence of hedging activities in the F&O market.
Analysts say Nifty volatility, which is near its lowest level in the past one decade, has led to complacency among investors about protecting their equity portfolio from any market decline as lower volatility means little chance of markets falling from their current levels. "FIIs' Nifty futures long positions have moved up significantly over the past few weeks whereas net options protection bought by FIIs (net Put options minus net Call options) has plunged into negative territory to hit its lowest point since January 2012, which suggests near absence of hedging positions," said Gaurav Mehta, derivatives analyst at Ambit Capital.
NSE India VIX — volatility index or investors' fear gauge meter — is trading near its all-time low at 12.36%, impacting derivatives option price movement, thus making many F&O strategies futile.
The drop in market volatility can be attributed to investors' growing confidence in stock markets, encouraged by the prospect of a strong economic recovery, aided by better corporate earnings numbers. "The premiums in options have come down significantly as investors don't see any risk in markets in the near-to-medium term. Market participants have also become reluctant to hedge their cash portfolio in the absence of any risk," said Jitendra Panda, managing director and CEO at Peerless Securities.
Adding to market confidence, FIIs have bought shares worth about Rs 85,000 crore ($14 billion) in cash market so far this year while the benchmark index BSE Sensex has surged nearly 28% during this period to become one of the best performing markets globally.
The highest Nifty Put option open interest (outstanding position) is seen at 8,000 strike with 86.62 lakh shares, suggesting that the index will take strong support around these levels. The highest Nifty Call option open interest is seen at 8,300 strike with 68.57 lakh shares, indicating that the index may move upwards to these levels in the September series, say analysts.
"Investors have become reluctant to construct short positions in the market despite stock indices trading near record levels — this is an unusual trading practice," said Bhavin Desai, equity derivatives analyst at Motilal Oswal.

A 17-year-old girl had allegedly eloped with her lover, who belongs to a different community, following which tension prevailed in the district, police said.
The minor had eloped with one Sanjiv Kumar on September 8 from Ladhawala locality here, police said, adding, the couple along with the help of some BJP activists met the Inspector General of Police (IG) Alok Sharma and sought protection.
However, the girl’s family members lodged a complaint on September 9 against Sanjiv and three others for abducting their daughter and threatening their family, SP city Sarvan Kumar said.
They also alleged that the girl was forced to convert by Sanjiv, he said.
The IG directed police officials to take the girl to the district hospital for medical examination, Kumar said, adding, she will be produced in the court on Monday for recording her statement.
The incident caused tension in the locality here as an irate mob from the girl’s family tried to take her with them from the police custody last evening, officials said.
The crowd was dispersed and security has been tightened in sensitive areas across the city, they said.

Pakistan floods: death toll reaches274Press Trust of India | Islamabad | Posted: September 13, 2014 3:41 pm
At least 274 people have been killed and over two million affected in massive flooding triggered by heavy monsoon rains in Pakistan, officials said on Saturday.
The rains lashed vast areas of the country last week and since have stopped but the floods triggered by the heavy showers are still out of control.
Reema Zubari of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said in a statement that 194 people have been killed in Punjab, 66 in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and another 14 in Gilgit-Baltistan region.
Over 2 million, majority of them in Punjab, were also affected by the floods.
The Chenab river is in high flood and raging down from central to south Punjab, leaving a trail of devastation.
The city of Multan has been saved after officials created several breaches in the protective embankments to divert the floods.
After Punjab, the flood is expected to hit southern province of Sindh by the weekend before going down into the Arabian sea.

Get medical X-rays printed on plain paper  courtesyRicohRicoh MPC2003SP printer can print medical images like X-ray, CT, MRI and Ultrasound directly on plain paper.
Tech Desk | New Delhi | Posted: September 13, 2014 3:31 pm
Ricoh India has unveiled a printing solution that can print medical images like X-Rays on plain paper instead of conventional films. This printing solution aims to bring down the cost of healthcare delivery,
DICOM or Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine, has revolutionized the practice of Radiology. DICOM has enabled advanced medical imaging applications that has “changed the face of clinical medicine”. From the emergency department, to cardiac stress testing, to breast cancer detection, DICOM is the standard that makes medical imaging work – for doctors and patients.
Ricoh DICOM print solution is designed specifically for healthcare sector, to meet the needs of Medical Imaging Department. Using this solution all medical images from different modalities, like X-ray, CT, MRI, Ultrasound, etc can be directly printed on plain paper by Ricoh MPC2003SP printer. This colored printer has been specifically customized for this process. The printing solution also impacts the environmental aspects of customer’s daily operations, as DICOM plain paper print reduces the need for chemical-based film processing and equipment, and further can be shredded and recycled.
One of the major challenges that the Indian diagnostic and health care industry faces is high print cost of medical imaging. It is also tedious to manage multiple printing devices for different medical images, and administration of various output sheets like films and papers. This conventional method and its higher running cost forces the diagnostic industry to compromise on the profits in order to ensure the customer retention. Ricoh claims to reduce costs by 50 per cent through its MPC2003SP printer.

Ferguson shootings: video shows witness raising hands in airprint
Cellphone video that shows a witness raising his hands in the air immediately after the fatal shooting of a black 18-year-old by a white police officer in Missouri appears to support previous accounts and could bolster arguments that the young man was surrendering when he was shot, legal experts said Friday.
The video obtained by The Associated Press and first aired by CNN shows two landscapers who were working near the street where Michael Brown, who was unarmed, was shot by officer Darren Wilson on August 9. In the video, a man can be heard saying, "He had his (expletive) hands in the air," while one of the workers raises his own hands in the air.Watch: Ferguson video shows shooting witness raising hands in the air
Brown's shooting spurred several days of sometimes violent protests in Ferguson, a predominantly black St. Louis suburb, and a nationwide debate about the relationship between young black men and law enforcement.
The man who took the cellphone video, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared for his safety, said the voice is that of the worker raising his hands, but that isn't clear on the video.
The workers are not from Ferguson, the St. Louis suburb where Brown was shot, and were employed by a business from Jefferson County, south of St. Louis. They have not come forward publicly and the AP has been unable to reach them.
The comment on the video largely matches those of residents of the apartment complex where the shooting occurred, who said Brown was surrendering when he was killed. A state grand jury and the Justice Department are investigating, but no decision on whether Wilson will face charges is expected until next month.
Benjamin Crump, the attorney for Brown's family, said both workers came forward and told the family their account of the shooting. He described the video as "of paramount significance."
"Not because they were not residents of Ferguson, and not because the construction workers were Caucasian, but because it is a contemporaneous recording of their immediate actions of what they had just witnessed," Crump said. "It's the best evidence you can have other than a video of the actual shooting itself."
Ed Magee, spokesman for St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch, said the workers are among witnesses who have been interviewed by authorities and are "part of the investigation."
The video likely would be admissible evidence before the grand jury along with the workers' testimony, said Peter Joy, a professor at Washington University School of Law in St. Louis.
"The thing that strikes me is we actually have a film of what's going on and while it's hard to hear the construction workers say what they're saying, you have one construction worker putting his hands up in the air, which appears to be him demonstrating what he's seeing," Joy said.
Lori Lightfoot, an attorney who previously worked as chief administrator for the Chicago Police division that oversaw officer-involved shootings, said the video could be significant but many questions remain: What was the vantage point of the workers? How far away were they from the shooting?
"Given the stakes, it's essential that all of these issues be tied down," she said.

It was a regular day of reporting. News of rain devastating most parts of Kashmir was pouring in.

Nine soldiers were trapped during rescue operations in south Kashmir. Chief minister Omar Abdullah, in a bright yellow jacket, had been overseeing rescue efforts on Saturday night last week. Preparations for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit were on.
Amid the chaos that night, a call from a friend asking about my parents was alarming.
I called my father asking about the status of water in their locality. As the by lanes appeared clogged, my parents said they might have to leave the next morning. But my father seemed convinced that the water wouldn’t breach the high walls of the MIG Colony at Qamarwari, an upmarket area of Srinagar. I carried on with my work.
At 3am on Sunday, the Jhelum breached its banks near my parents’ house. My parents told me that the water had started gushing into their three-storeyed house. By 6am, all exit points were blocked. My parents, both in their sixties, my sister-in-law and my two-year-old nephew were stranded. By 12pm, the house was under 12 feet of water.
Phones switched off
Panic-stricken, I tried calling officials. The Kashmir divisional commissioner and the Srinagar district commissioner had switched off their phones. CM Abdullah’s number was also out of reach, forcing me to leave an SMS around 11am. All I managed to reach was a disaster management official, who ironically had been rescued after three days of struggle in the flood.
The CM replied to my SMS at 4.30pm, saying Rajbagh was the priority as water was fast seeping into the area. By this time, the water had almost reached the second floor of our house and my family and other residents of the locality had to move to the third floor. Around 5pm, while I was talking to my father, the call dropped. I tried calling several times before giving up.
Roads turn into rivers
My brother took a flight back home but the sheer force of water did not allow him to reach the family. “It’s like a gushing stream in Pahalgam,” he told me. He was just a kilometre away, watching helplessly.
My aunt was carried to the third floor of her house in Rajbagh area. She along with 25 relatives, including eight children, was crying for help. Amid distress calls to officials and reporting the PM’s visit, I got the news that our office was submerged as water had breached Lal Chowk. Meanwhile, my uncle hired a boat to rescue my aunt, refuting claims that Rajbagh was a priority.
Rowing over chinar tree tops, trying to locate my aunt’s house among the only visible shining roofs, my uncles managed to rescue their sister from the partly submerged third storey of the house. It was after 12 rounds in the small shikara that the 25 people could be brought out.
Cries still haunt
“It was traumatic. People were shouting for help but we became selfish and just wanted to rescue our own first,” said one of my uncles.
“By the time we finished it was dark and impossible to go back. I have not slept peacefully since then and will never forget those cries for help for the rest of my life,” he said.
While they were rescuing their sister, my uncles’ house too came under the flood waters near the Dal Lake. They, along with my aunt’s family, moved into a dargah on a hilltop, which seemed the only safe option.
Meanwhile, my brother and I sent messages to friends in Delhi asking them to try rescue helplines. The numbers flashed on news channels were not working. I lost contact with the world around Sunday midnight.
Rowing to safety
With no phone and internet, my brother decided to rescue our family himself. Managing to get a strong shikara around 2pm on Monday, he rowed 2km to reach the locality.
“I was the first one to reach area and heard cries for help from all sides,” he said.
My parents decided to stay back and let my sister-in-law and nephew take the shikara as it was small. After the boat reached them a second time, they let the neighbour’s children go. Around 30 people were stranded as there had been a death in their family.
Monday night passed as my father, a diabetic, and my mother, a hypertension patient with a heart condition, were forced to stay on in a half-submerged house in candlelight.
Relatives to the rescue
By Tuesday, my brother managed to reach our parents at 5pm and promised his neighbours that he would be back. Some asked for medicines, some for food and water.
While my relatives managed to rescue family members from two worst-affected areas of Srinagar with no help from the government, most people in the inundated areas are still without food, electricity and water. But for their families, many would not have made it to safety.
I am writing this piece without the knowledge whether it will reach the readers of the Hindustan Times. Yet I am writing my story with a hope that it will make it through the heartless waters of the Jhelum and strike a chord with the citizens of this country. We can together force the central and state governments to undertake real rescue operations and not just flash promos for television news channels.

Sensex slips 62 points to end below 27k-mark; Sun Pharma down 4%stock exchanges
Falling for third straight session, benchmark Sensex on Thursday slid 61.54 points to end at 26,995.87 — its weakest level in nearly two weeks — on sharp losses in bluechips including Sun Pharma, ONGC and Coal India, amid negative Asian cues on continued US Fed rate hike worries.
The rupee, however, appeared to be rebounding from one-month lows of 60.95 against US dollar and was last trading at 60.77 levels on good selling of the greenback.
The 30-share BSE Sensex rose to day’s high of 27,150.78 in early trade but emergence of profit-booking brought it down. It finally settled below the 27,000-mark as it closed with a loss of 61.54 points, or 0.23 per cent, at 26,995.87 — its lowest close since 26,867.55 on September 1.
In 3 straight sessions, it has lost almost 324 points.
Brokers said sentiment was weak on reports of foreign institutional investors and domestic institutional investors turning sellers, after remaining major buyers for past several sessions, that had helped indices scale new highs.
Besides, profit-booking in recent out-performers and caution ahead of IIP and inflation data scheduled for Friday release, also affected sentiments, they said.
Among 30-Sensex stocks, Sun Pharma turned distinctly weak and closed 4.3 per cent down on reports of a surprise inspection by US drug regulator at its Halol plant in Gujarat.
Coal India fell 3.5 per cent on speculation the government will sell a portion of shares at a discount to their market price. On Wednesday, CCEA has cleared stake dilution in Coal India, ONGC and NHPC via Offer For Sale route.
Shares of ONGC slipped 3.58 per cent.
The 50-scrip Nifty of the National Stock Exchange lost 8.40 points, or 0.10 per cent, to settle at 8,085.70.
Intra-day, the Nifty shuttled between 8,127.95 and 8,057.30.
A mixed trend in other Asian markets and lower opening in Europe did not help domestic markets’ cause either.
Overall, 16 Sensex stocks declined while 14 led by SBI, Infosys, RIL, Axis Bank, BHEL, GAIL and Maruti ended up.
Sectorwise, the BSE Healthcare index suffered the most by losing 1.73 per cent, followed by Metal index (down 1.08 per cent), Oil & Gas index (down 0.48 per cent), Realty index (0.34 per cent) and Consumer Durables index (0.22 per cent).
On the other hand, BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices ended 1.03 per cent and 1.39 per cent up respectively.

How to set a super tough P@$$w0rd the easy wayWe tell you the easy way to create a password you will remember
Written by Nandagopal Rajan | Posted: September 11, 2014 5:10 pm | Updated: September 12, 2014 10:57 am
With reports suggesting that millions of email accounts, primarily in Russia and including at least 5 million Gmail accounts, have been compromised, it might be a good time to change that password of yours. The good news is that it does not appear at the moment that accounts in India are among the 10 million odd accounts, passwords of which have been leaked online. However, we still advise you to change your password and activate two step authentication if case you think your mail contains information that could damage you financially or professionally.
You will find all details on how to activate two-step authentication for Gmail here . It comes with its own share of hassles, but prevents others and unauthorised devices from accessing you mail.
Endpoint protection solutions provider Kaspersky Lab  has suggested these ways to make your passwords more secure.
According to them, here is what you must not do:
Use 1234 and asdfghj passwords
Use the same passwords for a number of various accounts
Use the same password for more than half a year
Write down your password at a place visible to everyone.
And here is what you must do
Initiate multifactor authentication (explained above)
Use tokens
Use long passwords
If you find it difficult to remember password, store them in an encrypted storage service like Last Pass , Dashlane or Norton Identity Safe .
If you ask me the best way to create a tough password that you will not forget is to use a phrase that is close to you.
Let us take the opening line of Robert Frost’s popular poem Road Not Taken.
TWO roads diverged in a yellow wood
Use first letter of the phrase to create a password: trdiayw, add you date of birth or some other numerals and cap one or two letters.
For instance: TrdiayW1947
If you want to make it stronger, add a special character. TrdiayW@1947
Now, who will guess that?
Just in case you need to check if your mail ID has been compromised, go to  https://isleaked.com/en.php
The best way to create a tough password that you will not forget is to use a phrase close to you.

Smart Cities  to Feature Wi-Fi ServiceHSBC Sees Higher India Growth, Lower Inflation in Coming Quarters
New Delhi:
Round-the-clock power and water supply, wi-fi connectivity and telemedicine facilities would be some of the highlights of the 100 'Smart Cities' which the
Centre has decided to develop across the country, the Urban Development Ministry has said.
According to a draft concept paper for the proposal released by the ministry, better transportation and sewage systems have also been envisaged for the Smart Cities.
The sewage system would be such that it would cover entire households with a door-to door garbage collection facility.
According to a senior ministry official, the draft concept paper contains broad contours for the project and covers the criteria for selection, financing and capacity-building needs.
In its maiden budget, the NDA government proposed that it would develop 100 Smart Cities in the country and the UD ministry is in the process of finalising the policy for the same.
Urban Development Minister Venkaiah Naidu has convened a conclave tomorrow of Urban Development ministers of the states and Union Territories to take their views and suggestions regarding the project.
Principal Secretaries of states/UTs dealing with urban development also will be attending the conclave, a UD Ministry official said.
Following the interaction with the states/UTs, the Smart Cities proposal will be finalised and submitted for approval of the competent authorities, the official said.

Court slams CBI over Hindalco closure reportHindalco closure report: Court pulls up CBI over missing file
IANS     New Delhi   Last Updated: September 12, 2014  | 17:33 IST

A special court in Delhi on Friday pulled up the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) over missing file related to original minutes of the screening committee meetings which dealt with the Kumar Mangalam Birla-promoted Hindalco's application for allocation of coal blocks in Odisha.
Special Judge Bharat Parashar asked the investigating agency what was the hurry in filing the closure report in the coal block allocation case against Birla and others.
"Where are the original minutes of screening committee meetings, in which Hindalco group application was dealt with for allocation of coal block ? Where are its original documents?" the court put it to the CBI.
The Investigating officer of the case exhibited photocopies of the documents related to application form. At this, the court asked whether they had been authenticated by the officials of the coal ministry.
The officer said the documents were seized in the presence of bank officials.
Rejecting the CBI's contention, the court asked what provisions of law prevented it from getting the documents authenticated from the ministry officials. "Can a bank official authenticate the documents of the ministry?", asked the court.
The officer told the court that the original document was missing.
An irked court then warned that it will initiate a preliminary enquiry for losing files of the case.
The court set Sep 22 as next date of hearing.
Earlier during the proceedings, the court asked the CBI to clarify whether element of criminality was involved while allocating the coal blocks to Hindalco.
The CBI booked Birla , former coal secretary P.C. Parakh and others on charges of criminal conspiracy and corruption in the allocation of coal blocks in October 2013.
It filed a closure report in the case Aug 28, saying "the evidence collected during investigation did not substantiate the allegations levelled against the persons named in the FIR".

Auto industry cannot be protected forever: KherRajeev Kher
New Delhi, September 12:  
In a veiled warning to the domestic auto sector, the Commerce Ministry on Friday said it cannot continue protecting the industry while duty barriers are coming down all over the world.
“...we have to look at to what extent the present tariff protection to the auto sector is sustainable ... we will have to question ourselves on the sustainability of a long-term tariff protection plan, particularly in an environment where every country is bringing down tariffs,” Commerce Secretary Rajeev Kher said here.
He was speaking at the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers annual convention.
India is protecting the domestic auto industry from overseas competition while signing free trade agreements with different nations and groups.
Kher said that while negotiating trade agreements one has to keep in mind the overall interest of different sectors.
“Over the last several years, by creating a tariff protection, we have consciously nurtured the industry. I think the point has come when the automotive plan needs to look to what extent we want to continue with that and how we want to bring it down to some kind of global par,” he said.

Nod for insurers to buy infra bondsBS Reporter |  Mumbai Sep 12, 2014
Last Updated at 11:55 PM IST
Nod for insurers to buy infra bonds
In July 2014, RBI permitted banks to issue long term bonds for financing infrastructure and affordable housing
Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (Irda) has allowed insurers to invest in Long Term Bonds for financing infrastructure and affordable housing issued by banks.
In July 2014, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) permitted banks to issue long term bonds for financing infrastructure and affordable housing.
The insurance regulator said that it has examined the RBI circular and will permit Insurers to reckon such Investments in the Long Term Bonds issued by Banks towards mandatory 'Infrastructure& Housing sector' exposure requirements in case of life insurers.
In case of general insurers, it will be under 'Infrastructure or Housing sector'.
Irda has said that these Investments will continue to be governed by exposure limits of BFSI. The rating requirements will qualify as 'Approved Investment' are as per existing Investment Regulations.
The regulator said that since the banks issue Long Term Bonds towards the dual purpose i.e. Financing Infrastructure and Affordable Housing, Investment Committee of insurers shall ensure to have robust mechanism on classification of such investment to qualify as Infrastructure or Housing Sector exposure considering predominant objectives of the offer.

Barack Obama points to "silver lining" in Islamic State mayhem in the region

(Obama has pointed to a "silver…)
WASHINGTON: US President Barack Obama has pointed to a "silver lining" in the violence wrought by the Islamic State , saying it has brought "clarity" in the Muslim world in a long time and there is an urgent need to snuff out this "brand of Islamic extremism".
At a Democratic Party fund-raiser, Obama said the militant group ISIS , poses the most prominent threat in the Middle East when it comes to terrorism. ISIS, he said has not only taken over large swathes of Iraq and Syria but displayed the kind of brutality that even by the standards of terrorists is extraordinary.
"What also is a silver lining in the terrible mayhem that ISIL has wrought throughout the region is that it has focussed attention I think for the first time in a long time in the Muslim world, a great clarity about the need to completely distance from and ultimately snuff out this particular brand of Islamic extremism that really has no place in the 21st century," Obama said yesterday.
"And that is I think a measure of how we have got to approach these problems because they're not going to go away immediately," he said.
"What gives me confidence is that we're on the right side of history here," he added.
In his televised speech earlier, Obama had vowed to "degrade and ultimately destroy" the Islamic State, as he announced a dramatic expansion of the US-led military campaign, including airstrikes for the first time in Syria and the formation of a broad coalition to fight the dreaded militant group so that it would "find no safe haven".
"We will defeat ISIL, but there are always going to be these threats of terrorism and we're going to have to make sure that we are creating the structure and the partnerships and the commitment that allows us over the long haul to win this fight," Obama said.

Raipur, Sept 13:  
The Chhattisgarh Government has decided to provide 10,000 solar lamps and other necessary electrical equipment, including transformers, to the people of flood-ravaged Jammu & Kashmir.
The decision was taken during a meeting of Chhattisgarh State Renewable Energy Development Agency (CREDA), which was chaired by Chief Minister Raman Singh, at the Mantralaya last evening, an official release said here today.
Besides solar lanterns, transformers and other equipment will be provided to maintain power supply in the flood-hit region of the northern state, it said.

Meanwhile, Singh also reviewed the works undertaken by CREDA during the current financial year from April-July along with its achievements in the previous fiscal.
In 2013-14, as many as 4,40,582 free solar lamps were distributed in the tribal inhabited remote areas, while 2,44,283 free solar study lamps were given to students, it said.
So far this year, as many as 1,146 families were provided solar lamps and solar study lamps were given to 3,832 students till July, it added.

Sony wins patent suit battle against defense contractor L-3
The ruling comes only a month after L3 announced that an employee complaint had exposed accounting misconduct at the company, prompting it to fire four people, revise two years of earnings statements and cut its earnings forecast.

Sony wins patent suit battle against defense contractor L-3

Post your opinion here
 
A federal judge has ruled in favor of Sony Corp in a long-running case, overturning a jury verdict for L-3 Communications Corp and invalidating several parts of an image sensor patent held by the defense contractor.
Judge Richard Andrews of the US District Court in Delaware said on Friday that the jury in 2013 was wrong to find L-3's patent claims were not "obvious," a key criteria to ensure an invention is sufficiently unique to be patented.
New York-based L-3, which supplies a wide range of military and civil electronics equipment and services, sued Sony in 2010 over a patent for the image sensors, which it said were originally developed for military low-light applications.
L-3 said Sony infringed the patent by using the technology in its digital still and video cameras, computers and mobile phones.
Sony counter-sued, asking the court to declare the patent claims invalid. A trial was held in 2013, but the jury determined the patent was valid.
Sony demanded that the judge overturn the finding, which Andrews did, ruling that L-3's patent only described "obvious" additions to technology that already existed.
Representatives from Sony and L-3 could not immediately be reached for comment.
The ruling comes only a month after L3 announced that an employee complaint had exposed accounting misconduct at the company, prompting it to fire four people, revise two years of earnings statements and cut its earnings forecast.
The case is L-3 Communications Corp v. Sony Corp et al, No. 10-cv-00734, in US District Court for the District of Delaware.

New Delhi, Sept 13:  
After a gap of 18 years, BJP’s student wing Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) today swept Delhi University Students’ Union (DUSU) elections, trouncing Congress’ NSUI to bag all four positions and credited the triumph to “Modi wave”.
The ABVP won the posts of president, vice president, secretary and joint secretary by comfortable margins, bettering last year’s performance when it had lost one of the seats to the National Students’ Union of India (NSUI).
Mohit Nagar was elected president of DUSU, while Pravesh Malik won the elections for vice-president’s post. Kanika Shekhawat and Ashutosh Mathur have been elected as secretary and joint secretary, respectively.

Last year, ABVP had won the posts of president, vice-president and joint secretary while NSUI, had managed to capture only secretary’s post.
“Expectations of people have gone up after Modi government came to power. The ABVP fulfilled its promises of scrapping the four-year undergraduate (FYUP) programme. We won because of the Modi wave,” said Rohit Chahal, National Secretary, ABVP.
BJP national president Amit Shah took to twitter to congratulate ABVP on their victory.
“I congratulate ABVP for winning all 4 panels in DUSU elections. The students & karyakartas of DU deserve the credit,” he tweeted.
Parvesh Malik, who polled 21,935 votes, defeated NSUI’s candidate Mona Chodhary with the margin of 7,859 votes.
Chodhary got 15,649 votes, Rawat said.

Gujarat BJP on Saturday filed a complaint and sought action against Congress candidates from Maninagar and Anand assembly seats, where by-elections are underway, for alleged violation of the poll code.
“BJP has filed complaint against Congress candidates Jatin Kella from Maninagar assembly seat and Kanti Sodha from Anand assembly seat for violating poll code as they were wearing scarf with Congress’ election symbol on it when they went to vote,” BJP state unit spokesperson Harshad Patel said.
The complaint was filed before the Election Commission seeking legal action against both the candidates, Patel added. Voting is underway in one Lok Sabha constituency and nine assembly seats in Gujarat.
The by-polls were necessitated on these seats as sitting BJP MLAs resigned from their posts after winning the recent Lok Sabha elections. Maninagar assembly seat was vacated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi after he emerged victorious from Lok Sabha seats in Gujarat (Vadodara) and Uttar Pradesh (Varanasi).
Vadodara Lok Sabha seat is witnessing by-poll today as it was also vacated by Modi after he preferred Varanasi over the constituency in his home-town.

MCL likely to present Sundargarh power project proposal on Sept 17

Kolkata, Sept 13:  
Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd is likely to present the detailed proposal of its Sundargarh power project in Odisha before the board for clearance on September 17.
The proposed 1,600-MW (2x800 MW) pit-head power plant will come up at an estimated cost of Rs 10,000 crore.
According to A K Sahay, Chairman and Managing Director, Mahanadi Coalfields, the detailed project report will then be sent to Coal India Ltd for clearance. (MCL is a CIL subsidiary.)
“We will also apply for clearances from the Environment Ministry once the boards of MCL and CIL pass the DPR,” he told reporters on the sidelines of a mining seminar organised by 'The Mining, Geological & Metallurgical Institute of India'.
MCL has already acquired the required 800 acres of land and obtained the water corridor required for the power plant.
“It will take us three years to complete the project after getting environment clearances,” he said.

Apple Smartwatch: Swiss Watch Industry Denies  Nokia MomentZurich/Frankfurt: Apple Inc's iPod upended the music industry, and its iPhone knocked Nokia off its smartphone perch, but Swiss watch makers breezily dismissed warnings that the technology giant's new wristwatch gadget could do something similar to them.
"They are essentially transient products rather than items of enduring value," one Swiss watch industry expert sniffed.
Franz Tuerler, owner of a luxury watch store on Zurich's main shopping boulevard, Bahnhofstrasse, said the appeal of Apple watches would be to a different class of customer who prizes technology over prestige and emotional attachment.
"I think the Apple Watch will be successful. But it's not competition for the classic Swiss watch industry," Tuerler said.
While the luxury end of the market might feel itself well insulated from the blast of competition from Apple, analysts are far from convinced that the industry can be complacent, especially at the more affordable end.
Vontobel watch industry analyst Rene Weber told Reuters: "(Apple Watch) is the first convincing smartwatch, and we believe it will impact the entire watch industry, but mainly at the low-/mid-end price level."
An industry source acknowledged that watches priced between 500 euros and 1,500 euros ($646-1,940) could feel the pinch.
Investors have singled out diversified industry heavyweight Swatch Group, which makes 20 per cent of its sales in the low- and mid-priced ranges, as most at risk.
Swatch shares were lower on the Zurich exchange after Apple spelled out its plans to offer three lines of watches - sport, standard and luxury versions - with prices starting at $349 (270 euros) and set to ship in early 2015.
Its shares have lost nearly 18 per cent of their value so far this year, lagging an 8 per cent rise in the Swiss market index, and analysts cite Apple's market entry as the main reason.
The Swiss industry has so far taken a decision not to join but to try and beat the smartwatch phenomenon. Not a single watchmaker has announced a deal with a technology company to work together on a smartwatch project. Swatch has said several times it has all the knowhow to make "smart" watches and does not want to be dependent on a partner.
Swatch Chief Executive Nick Hayek told Reuters in a recent interview that the company prefers to go it alone with a launch next year of watches with smart fitness functions.
Apple Watch, however, will be sending messages, playing music, and acting as a payment medium on top of health monitoring functions. The danger for the watchmakers is if Apple succeeds in redefining what people expect from a wristwatch.
Jean-Marc Jacot, chief executive of privately owned Parmigiani, whose watches sell for an average 30,000 euros, does not see that as a threat.
"High-end consumers will buy Apple Watch, because it is Apple, but they should not stop buying classical watches. They will have both," he said.

Cognizant to Buy IT Services Provider Trizetto for $2.7 Billion
Mumbai: ICICI Bank on Wednesday launched a facility under which an account holder can transfer money to a mobile phone user in the country even without the latter having an account with any lender.
A customer having a savings account with ICICI Bank can initiate a fund transfer using online banking by providing only the mobile number and address of the beneficiary, the country's largest private lender said in a statement.
For availing of funds under the 'Cardless Cash Withdrawal' scheme, the beneficiary need not have an account with any bank, it said.
A secure six-digit code gets sent to the mobile number of the beneficiary, who can then withdraw the amount from any of the lender's 10,000 ATMs using that number, the statement noted.
The money has to be withdrawn within two days of transfer.
"We foresee tremendous growth potential in the usage of electronic payments. This innovative service will further empower our customers as well as their families and friends by giving access to instant money even without having a bank account or a debit card," ICICI Bank executive director Rajiv Sabharwal said.

FDI in Online Retail Will Help in Aggressive Growth: AmazonUS-Based Gilead Licenses Hepatitis C Drug to Cipla, Ranbaxy, 5 Others
New Delhi:
Global retail giant Amazon today said allowing foreign direct investment in eCommerce will help in accelerating further growth in the $3 billion Indian online retail market.
"We are already very successful but FDI would make possible to spin it more aggressively," said Amit Agarwal, Amazon vice-president and managing director India.
Amazon, which operates on a marketplace model in India, is betting big on the country and has announced investment of $2 billion to expand its operations here.
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) norms in India do not allow FDI in e-commerce. Most e-tailers like Flipkart and Snapdeal follow the online marketplace model, where they connect sellers and buyers.
Amazon, which launched its marketplace in India last year, counts India among its fastest growing markets and has said it is on track to touch $1 billion in gross sales here.
In India, Amazon sells over 17 million products across categories like books, apparel and electronics from a growing base of thousands of small and medium-sized businesses. It also plans to open 5 new centres across India in addition to its two fulfilment centres (FCs) in Mumbai and Bangalore.
Apart from foreign players like Amazon, industry bodies like Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) are also supporting the move, saying it will help e-commerce firms grow Internet usage in the country and provide players access to funds for investing in technology and back-end operations.
According to IAMAI, only 25 million of over 231 million Internet users in India transacted online (as of December 2013), taking the Indian e-Commerce market to Rs 62,697 crore

Amid Alibaba Fever  Reasons for Caution in IPO MarketYou are here: Home Corporates
Amid Alibaba Fever, Reasons for Caution in IPO Market
Reuters | Updated On: September 11, 2014 22:45 (IST)
Cognizant to Buy IT Services Provider Trizetto for $2.7 Billion
New York: The highly anticipated debut of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, the Chinese e-commerce group, will come amid the busiest year for initial public offerings since the technology bubble burst in 2000.
Alibaba's IPO, which could come as soon as September 19, could raise more than $21 billion and claim Facebook Inc's title of biggest tech IPO. It will usher in a fall season when plenty of new names sell shares for the first time in the US market.
Returns from IPOs so far this year have been mixed. Some analysts say large swaths of the market, especially biotechnology stocks, are frothy.
The percentage of IPOs coming from money-losing companies has jumped to a 14-year high, according to Jay Ritter, a professor of finance and leading scholar of IPOs at the University of Florida.
The mixed financial results could dim enthusiasm for some of the hot names coming later this year, including web hosting company GoDaddy, airline Virgin America, and possibly burger chain Shake Shack, which has been exploring an IPO.
Roughly one-third of the 188 stocks that debuted this year are selling below their IPO price. New stocks have risen an average of 19 per cent over the first three months of trading, compared with 36 per cent in 2013, and 23 per cent in 2012, according to research firm Dealogic in New York.
"With the exception of mature companies like Alibaba, a lot of the companies that have all the hype around them tend to underperform beyond the first day. They just get squeezed to valuations that are beyond what they can absorb," said Kathleen Smith, who manages Greenwich, Connecticut-based Renaissance Capital's IPO ETF.
MediWound Ltd, a biopharmaceutical company, serves as a cautionary tale. Its shares down 60 per cent from the first closing price.
In perhaps the year's biggest flop, shares of King Digital Entertainment Plc, the maker of mobile game "Candy Crush Saga," have tumbled more than 29 per cent since going public in March.
"Remember how a few years ago, everyone had Angry Birds? That seems so 1998 now. These things run on a life cycle, and you need new things in the content pipeline all the time," said Jim O'Donnell, chief investment officer at San Francisco-based Forward, which has $5 billion in assets under management.
Some of the IPOs from late last year, including casual dining chain Potbelly Corp, have also sunk. Potbelly is down 60 per cent from its first-day close.
Given the underwhelming performance of several high-profile IPOs in recent months, some analysts worry investor appetite for risk is reaching unsustainable levels.
Much of the influx of money-losing companies comes from one sector, biotechnology, where investors tolerate spotty track records in hopes of cashing in on lucrative payouts.
While some investors find their bets rewarded, as in the case of UltraGenyx Pharmaceutical Inc, which is up 176 per cent from its IPO price, others are disappointed. Three of the five worst performing IPOs of 2014 are in biotechnology.
"They're essentially looking at companies that don't have much in the way of revenue or profit and hoping to see that one big blockbuster drug approval or pharma company buyout," said Jeff Reeves, editor of InvestorPlace.com in Rockville, Maryland.
Yet even excluding biotech, IPOs look rich. Offer prices have been about 50 per cent higher this year than the average from 2001 to 2013, even as median sales declined to $136.2 million from $187.3 million in the year before the companies go public, according to Ritter.
Experts say the stock market's gains, with the S&P 500 topping 2,000 for the first time last month, are somewhat responsible for the appetite for risk. And with the U.S. Federal Reserve keeping rates low, investors seeking growth are attracted to more untested companies.
"Individual investors' appetite for risk will be predicated on the economic backdrop. If they think the Fed will continue to be accommodating, they'll be more apt to want to take risks on IPOs," said Joel Guth, chief executive officer of Gryphon Financial Partners, a member of the HighTower Network.
Still, there are some indications investors are becoming cautious. In the second quarter, stocks rose an average of 9.2 per cent on their first day of trading. In each of the three quarters before that, stocks popped about 20 per cent.
That could mean the torrent of companies slated for IPOS in the next few months, like restaurant-arcade chain Dave & Buster's Entertainment and peer-to-peer banker LendingClub, will be met with more skepticism.
"When valuations are at their highest level in years, at some point, there's going to be a correction," Ritter said.

Politics of polarisationUpdated: September 12, 2014 00:57 IST
Politics of polarisation
election
Impending elections invariably colour a government’s actions. Whether the filing of a charge sheet for hate speech against Bharatiya Janata Party president Amit Shah just two days before by-elections to 11 Assembly seats and one Lok Sabha seat in Uttar Pradesh is politically motivated, is a moot question. The charge sheet against Mr. Shah was returned by the court, lending greater force to the BJP’s allegation that the entire exercise was a desperate measure by the Akhilesh Yadav government in the face of a likely defeat for the ruling Samajwadi Party in the by-elections. However, the questions raised by the case against Mr. Shah go far beyond the concerns of the immediate elections and relate to issues of freedom of speech, incitement of violence, religious sensibilities and corrupt practices. Mr. Shah, during the Lok Sabha election campaign in April, called for avenging the Muzaffarnagar communal riots, prompting the Election Commission to initially ban him from campaigning. The BJP insists this was not incitement to violence, but only an appeal to avenge the riots through the ballot box. Even on this interpretation, Mr. Shah’s call for avenging the riots implied that a vote for the BJP would be an act of revenge for the Hindu victims of the communal riots. Whether the sections of the IPC invoked in the charge sheet relating to promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings, and false statements circulated with intent to cause offence against public peace, would stand judicial scrutiny remains to be seen, but Mr. Shah clearly crossed the lines of political propriety during the campaign. The BJP leader seemed quite close to attracting the provision of the Representation of the People Act that defines an appeal to vote for any person on the ground of religion as a corrupt practice.
The Election Commission rightly rescinded its ban on Mr. Shah following an apology but, not surprisingly, the case seems to have got a second wind now with another rise in the political temperature in Uttar Pradesh. If the Samajwadi Party government has timed the charge sheet to coincide with the by-elections, then the BJP is surely encouraging its Member of Parliament Yogi Adityanath to make provocative statements that could make Mr. Shah uncomfortable. Despite the district administration cancelling permission for his meeting, Mr. Adityanath went ahead with his rally in a communally sensitive area. Clearly, no matter what its defence of Mr. Shah’s remarks, the BJP is intent on adopting the politics of provocation in Uttar Pradesh. Polarisation on religious lines may pay short-term political dividends but it will do grievous harm to the social fabric.

New Delhi:
Country's largest two-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp plans to launch three new models including two new scooters early next year.
Besides, it plans to begin the construction of its Gujarat plant soon and operationalise the facility by third quarter of next financial year.
"During the early part of next year we will start rolling out new scooters. Two new scooters and one motorcycle model are on the anvil right now," Hero MotoCorp Vice Chairman and Managing Director Pawan Munjal told reporters here on the sidelines of SIAM annual convention.
During the upcoming festive season the company plans to introduce 12 refreshed versions of the existing models, he added. "These 12 variants have improved features including engines. All of them would be introduced during the festive season."
When asked about the sales projections during the festive season, Munjal said: "I am bullish about the festival season. Sentiments have improved and the market will improve further. We expect to do better than the last year."
The company had sold 6 lakh units during the last year's festival season.
On the company's upcoming Gujarat plant, Munjal said: "We will start construction soon and will launch the facility in the third quarter of next fiscal."
The plant will have an installed capacity of 1.8 million units per annum. The company's current production capacity is 7.65 million units.
Commenting on the proposed plant in South India, Munjal said the company is yet to finalise the site for the facility.
On whether the company is looking at hiking prices, he said: "There is pressure on pricing for sure so there will be some price corrections off and on." He however did not provide specific details.
Talking about its overseas plans, Munjal said: "We are seriously considering Argentina... Team is going there and doing due diligence. We are sure we will soon find a partner and start operations."
He added that the company will start operations in Brazil in 2016 and is currently working on ethanol powered engines for the market.
On launching products in the US market, Munjal said product homologation process is going on and the entry of the company in the country would happen in 2016 summer.
It would set up distribution in the US but is still to finalise the branding part, he added.

FinMin seeks cabinet nod to reduce stake in banks to 52%FinMin seeks cabinet not to bring down government stake in banks to 52%
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: September 12, 2014  | 17:26 IST

The Finance Ministry is finalising the draft Cabinet note on reducing government stake in public sector banks to up to 52 per cent as part of its recapitalisation drive .
In 2010, the then Cabinet had approved a proposal to keep the minimum shareholding of government to 58 per cent in PSU banks in order to provide buffer for the future.
A draft note is now being finalised for obtaining a blanket approval from the Cabinet to bring down minimum stake of the government in state-owned banks from 58 per cent to up to 52 per cent as and when required. It would soon be circulated to different ministries for their feedback, sources said.
The capital would be raised through various instruments and at different times depending on the best valuation, they said. It will be done through a combination of FPO and QIP.
Besides, banks could raise capital through bonds and selling assets.
As per the law, government holding at any moment must not come below 51 per cent to maintain the public sector character of PSU banks.
At present, government shareholding in various banks varies between 56.26 per cent (Bank of Baroda) and 88.63 per cent (Central Bank of India).
PSU banks require equity capital of Rs 2.4 lakh crore by 2018 to meet Basel III norms . For the current fiscal, the government has allocated Rs 11,200 crore for bank capitalisation.
The government has infused an amount of Rs 58,600 crore between 2011 to 2014.
During the current fiscal, sources said, State Bank of India (SBI) and Punjab National Bank (PNB) may be among the first banks to tap capital market in FY15 to raise funds to meet global risk norms Basel III .
The government holds 58.60 per cent stake in SBI, the country's largest bank, and 58.87 per cent stake in the country's second largest PSU bank PNB.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, in his 2014 Budget speech, had said, "to be in line with Basel-III norms there is a requirement to infuse Rs 2,40,000 crore as equity by 2018 in our banks. To meet this huge capital requirement we need to raise additional resources to fulfil this obligation."
While preserving public ownership, the capital of these banks will be raised by increasing the shareholding of the people in a phased manner through the sale of shares, largely through retail, to citizens of this country, the minister had said.
"Thus, while the government will continue to have majority shareholding, the citizens of India will also get direct shareholding in these banks, which currently they hold indirectly," he had said.

US Watchdog Approves First Bitcoin SwapYou are here: Home Forex
Bitcoin Gets Boost as US Watchdog Approves First Swap
Reuters | Updated On: September 12, 2014 19:17 (IST)
Rupee Snaps 2-Day Fall, Closes at 60.92 Per Dollar
Washington: TeraExchange on Friday launched a swap based on the bitcoin virtual currency, becoming the first to receive approval from a US federal regulator for a financial product based on the budding technology.
The derivative allows clients to protect the value of their bitcoin holdings by locking in a dollar value, offering an insurance against the astronomical price swings that have plagued the computer-generated currency.
"For a merchant to take bitcoin, there wasn't until this product a regulated way for them to put on a hedge to manage the risk ... and now with this product they can," Christian Martin, who heads TeraExchange, told Reuters.
Unlike conventional money, bitcoin is independent of control or backing by any government - something its advocates like, but that has also led to calls for more oversight and raised questions as to how to treat it for tax purposes.
Bitcoin started circulating in 2009 and is accepted as payment by an increasing, if small, number of companies. But huge swings in its value and incidents where clients lost millions of dollars have hurt its reputation.
It took TeraExchange, which was launched in 2010, almost half a year to get the product past the regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, since first announcing its plans to launch the swap in March.
The company, one of a handful of platforms to facilitate regulated swaps trading that sprung up after the crisis, had to construct an index to gauge the value of bitcoin that the CFTC was satisfied could not easily be manipulated.
The global scandal around the Libor interest rate benchmark, in which large banks were forced to pay billions of dollars, showed how easily traders can skew benchmarks, and then make profits through their swaps positions.
The Tera Bitcoin Price Index was based on information from six different exchanges, the company said, a number it expected to grow. It had agreed with the exchanges to share information if there were suspicious price moves.
A decision last year by the US Treasury to classify exchangers of bitcoin as money transmitters put such firms under the remit of state regulators, and the industry has met with a fractured response from federal regulators.
The decision by the CFTC, which regulates swaps and futures, constitutes the first recognition by a US federal regulator of a bitcoin financial product, even if the product does not itself involve the exchange of actual bitcoins.
The swap locks in the dollar value of a given bitcoin amount, and the difference is settled in dollars when the contract expires. At both moments, the contract references the new price index, which is published in real time.
TeraExchange said it had signed up some 50 clients that were interested in the products, merchants, hardware suppliers and the so-called miners who retrieve the bitcoins from the computer programmes that generate the virtual currency.
The swap had been available to trade from Friday morning, and the company would now start marketing it. It had already received commitments from market makers, companies that offer prices for buyers and sellers to facilitate trading.

"Singapore will always remain strategic and integral to our business plans for the future. We are committed to grow the relationships and partnerships that we have established here, the most prominent being our association with the Economic Development Board of Singapore (EDB) and the SGX listed Religare Healthcare Trust," they added.

L&T  Tatas Among 9 in Fray for Colaba-Seepz Metro ProjectCognizant to Buy IT Services Provider Trizetto for $2.7 Billion
Mumbai: Ahead of the Maharashtra Assembly polls scheduled for October 15, the Rs 23,136-crore Colaba-Seepz Metro project, which is the single largest infra investment in the megapolis to date, got off to a flying start with nine out of the 14 bidders clearing the eligibility criteria.
As many as 14 consortia put up their bids for proposals in the pre-bidding process, out of which nine cleared the eligibility criteria for the 32.5-km underground metro, according to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA).
The nine consortia which have qualified in the pre-bid process include Pallonji Mistry's Afcons Infrastructure- Kyivmetrobud; the Tatas-led Continental Engineering Corporation-ITD Cementation India-Tata Projects; Dogus-Soma, and IL&FS Engineering & Construction-China Railway 25th Bureau Group.
J Kumar Infraprojects-China Railway 3 Engineering Group, L&T-Shanghai Tunnel Engineering, OSJC Moscow Metrostroy-Hindustan Construction Company, Pratibha Industries-Guandong Tuantian Engineering, and Unity Infraprojects-IVRCL-China Railway Tunnel Group are the remaining consortia.
The Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation (MMRC), which is implementing the mega project, will now issue request for proposal and the process is expected to be completed by December after which the work is likely to commence from next year.
On August 26, Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan had laid the foundation stone of the project paving way for the commencement of construction work which is being implemented on EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) basis.
The MMRC had invited re-qualification bids last September. However, due to certain issues raised by bidders on the eligibility criteria, the MMRC re-invited the bids for detailed design and construction of underground stations and tunnels bids on January 31.
In July, MMRC had invited tenders for civil and other development work at the metro car depot worth Rs 129.32 crore in Aarey Colony, Goregaon.
The government has signed a loan agreement with Japanese funding agency JICA which will provide nearly 57 per cent of the total cost of the project, or Rs 13,235 crore.
The Centre and the state will equally contribute the remaining 43 per cent equity for the project. Further, Rs 777 crore will also be borne by the Mumbai International Airport, since the metro will pass through the MIAL areas.
The Colaba-Seepz Metro will comprise 27 stations, out of which 26 will be underground and the one at the Aarey Colony, Goregaon, will be at the ground level.
The corridor is expected to carry 13.9 lakh commuters daily by 2021 and 17 lakh by 2031.
The 27 Metro stations are Cuffe Parade, Vidhan Bhavan, Churchgate, Hutatma Chowk, CST, Kalbadevi, Girgaon, Grant Road, Mumbai Central, Mahalaxmi, Science Museum, Acharya Atre Chowk, Worli, Siddhi Vinayak, Dadar, Shitaladevi Temple, Dharavi, BKC, Vidya Nagari, Santacruz, Domestic Airport, Sahar Road, International Airport, Marol Naka, MIDC, Seepz and Goregaon.

Fortis to divest stake in RadLink-Asia  armFortis to divest stake in RadLink-Asia, Arm for Rs
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: September 13, 2014  | 10:27 IST
Fortis Healthcare has decided to divest 100 per cent stake in healthcare service provider RadLink-Asia and its arm RadLink Singapore to Medi-Rad Associates for 137 million Singapore dollars (over Rs 655 crore).
"Fortis Healthcare Singapore Pte Ltd, a subsidiary of Fortis Healthcare International Pte Ltd, one of our step-down subsidiaries in Singapore, today announced its decision to divest 100 per cent shareholding in RadLink-Asia Pte Ltd and its subsidiaries, 'RadLink', Singapore to Medi-Rad Associates Ltd, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of IHH Healthcare Berhad, for 137,000,000 Singapore dollars," Fortis Healthcare said in a statement.
The deal will be successfully closed following the necessary statutory and regulatory approvals as per local requirements, it added.
RadLink is engaged in providing healthcare services including outpatient diagnostic and molecular imaging services in Singapore, Fortis Healthcare said.
"This is in line with our strategic decision to intensify our focus on our core hospital and diagnostics business in India," Fortis Healthcare executive chairman Malvinder Singh and executive vice chairman Shivinder Singh said.
The company's international healthcare businesses have all done well and the significant value that it has created, is now being unlocked and will be ploughed back to strengthen growth in India, they added.
"Singapore will always remain strategic and integral to our business plans for the future. We are committed to grow the relationships and partnerships that we have established here, the most prominent being our association with the Economic Development Board of Singapore (EDB) and the SGX listed Religare Healthcare Trust," they added.
During fiscal year 2014, Fortis added over 800 beds to its network in India. Currently it operates in India, Singapore, Dubai, Mauritius and Sri Lanka with 66 healthcare facilities (including projects under development), over 10,000 potential beds and 282 diagnostic centres.

Why FIIs consider their Indian investments as safest betF&O market
(NSE VIX — volatility index…)
MUMBAI: Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) consider their Indian market investments to be the safest with very little downside risks, as derivatives option protection bought by FIIs to circumvent their equity portfolio from any market decline hit multi-year lows, indicating near absence of hedging activities in the F&O market.
Analysts say Nifty volatility, which is near its lowest level in the past one decade, has led to complacency among investors about protecting their equity portfolio from any market decline as lower volatility means little chance of markets falling from their current levels. "FIIs' Nifty futures long positions have moved up significantly over the past few weeks whereas net options protection bought by FIIs (net Put options minus net Call options) has plunged into negative territory to hit its lowest point since January 2012, which suggests near absence of hedging positions," said Gaurav Mehta, derivatives analyst at Ambit Capital.
NSE India VIX — volatility index or investors' fear gauge meter — is trading near its all-time low at 12.36%, impacting derivatives option price movement, thus making many F&O strategies futile.
The drop in market volatility can be attributed to investors' growing confidence in stock markets, encouraged by the prospect of a strong economic recovery, aided by better corporate earnings numbers. "The premiums in options have come down significantly as investors don't see any risk in markets in the near-to-medium term. Market participants have also become reluctant to hedge their cash portfolio in the absence of any risk," said Jitendra Panda, managing director and CEO at Peerless Securities.
Adding to market confidence, FIIs have bought shares worth about Rs 85,000 crore ($14 billion) in cash market so far this year while the benchmark index BSE Sensex has surged nearly 28% during this period to become one of the best performing markets globally.
The highest Nifty Put option open interest (outstanding position) is seen at 8,000 strike with 86.62 lakh shares, suggesting that the index will take strong support around these levels. The highest Nifty Call option open interest is seen at 8,300 strike with 68.57 lakh shares, indicating that the index may move upwards to these levels in the September series, say analysts.
"Investors have become reluctant to construct short positions in the market despite stock indices trading near record levels — this is an unusual trading practice," said Bhavin Desai, equity derivatives analyst at Motilal Oswal.

HDFC Bank to grow 30% if economy expands at 7%Probably RBI realised that if the rest of the world is not senile till 70, bankers could probably keep their sense till then.
Aditya Puri
Managing Director
HDFC Bank
Aditya Puri would certainly be a happy man after the Reserve Bank of India raised the age limit for private bank chiefs to retire to 70. But more so, investors would be the happiest as there has been no denying that HDFC Bank  could report 25 percent growth for the past 80 quarters, since its existence, largely due to its architect.
Discussing the RBI move, HDFC Bank Managing Director Aditya Puri said that probably the central bank has realised that even bankers can work till 70.
The RBI’s move is in line with the new Companies Act, which allows all directors and managing directors to serve up to 70 years.
On Foreign Investment Promotion Board’s (FIPB) insistence that HDFC ’s stake in the bank is a foreign investment, Puri said he expects clarity on the matter in a month or so.
While the bank has grown at 25 percent for the past around 76 quarters, growth in the last four quarters has come down towards 20 percent. However, Puri is affirmative that he will get back to 25 percent and even 30 percent growth when the economy gets back to 6-7 percent growth, which he expects by FY16.
He said it is dangerous for the banks to grow fast when the economy is slowing as it can result in higher non-performing loans.
Below is the transcript of Aditya Puri’s interview with CNBC-TV18’s Latha Venkatesh
Q: The RBI has raised the upper age limit for retirement for the managing directors to 70 years. First up why did they do it? I have got three options, you tell me which. One, Raghuram Rajan knows that banking talent is scarce and whatever is there should be conserved; B, Mr Aditya Puri has clout and C, a bit of both?
A: You can eliminate B, they probably did it because they realised that if the rest of the world is not senile till 70 the bankers could probably keep their sense till then.
Q: That clearly gives you another six years. I will call it the last innings just because that makes it all the more important. You have done 20 percent growth for 80 quarters why will be different in the last innings?
A: This is actually a very exciting time for us. What has happened if you see when we have been talking over a period, in the last 3-4 years we have gone to semi urban and rural India. That is where 60 percent of India lives and that is where organised finance is actually not penetrated at all.
The second part is when you see what has happened to both the advertising world and to Big Data and technology, you have a situation where you have multiplicity of channels, you have multiplicity of distribution channels for companies, multiplicity of customer segments which makes traditional brand building very difficult. However what it also does if you analyse Big Data very well is, it gives you the ability to give the right product to the right person at the right time.
The third is what we are doing in terms of our CSR, where we have brought 3 million families from below the poverty line to above the line. Three million families, 5 to a family that is a lot of people. We intend to take this to 10 million. A combination of this is not only going to make money for the shareholders but it is personally gratifying to substitute the money lender, to go in and deal at the cutting edge of technology and to deal with the bottom of pyramid at the same time.
Q: Is Jan Dhan Yojna also applicable to private sector banks?
A: Yes absolutely.
Q: So, you mandatorily will have to open a set number of accounts...
A: We have villages allocated to us and in those villages we will be the ones opening the account and considering we have neither government ownership nor government business this is from the goodness of our heart.
Q: Is it goodness or will it be beneficial at all? This is a very genuine problem because  very senior, responsible and equally committed bankers like you told us that RBI's previous thrust, they opened something like 10 million accounts of which probably 3 transactions got done in the whole year per account. The point is that no frills account or the basic accounts are not getting used. Will it be any different in the next 6 years?
A: If it is going to be different. It will be different in the next 6 months and if it is not then it is not going to be any different in the next 6 years. The point is very simple unless the government follows through and ensures that the direct benefit transfer and other subsidies is made into this account number one so that they have balances and we are also able to build credit history.
Two, the government is saving a lot of money and I think they should be gracious enough to pass some of that to the banks because we are commercial organisations. I think this time they are looking very carefully and they will ensure at least that’s what they have assured us that they will ensure direct benefit transfer. They will ensure that Aadhaar seeding is done as it is really lagging behind. So, Aadhaar seeding has to be done and then we have to match the records with the government and money has to be paid there then you can look at further inclusion in terms of providing an overdraft dependent upon how much money he is regularly getting from the customer.
Q: You have been assured that some 2 percent commission...
A: But we were assured that previously as well and it did not happen.
Q: I took one case study on previous Indianomics show, united Andhra Pradesh was most advanced in terms of Aadhaar seeding. They had 8 crore Aadhaar cards. Practically the entire state was covered.
A: They shifted to the post office.
Q: Then how are you so sure?
A: I am not sure, I am just hoping. Rajasthan has its own scheme. So, the state governments and the Centre have to be in sync, Aadhaar has to be there and they have to ensure that we get the direct benefit transfer otherwise there is no other source of funds.
Q: Do you think payment bank will be able to achieve at least in urban areas and semi rural areas what probably basic accounts won't?
A: I am not quite sure I think we need a clear definition for everybody to understand what a payment bank is. Everybody goes back to M-Pesa, which is only a payment mechanism and not an account. The moment you talk of a payment bank the telcos will have to set up all the infrastructure of a bank. Then they will get deposits. The issue is after that are they going to lend? No.
So, financial inclusion is only the first step is the opening of the account. One becomes financially included when you allow him sustainability, which is the next step.
Q: Their first response was that we will get more stickiness in our prepaid accounts so we will follow through at least because there will be benefit for the telecom business even if this one is not in itself paying. You don’t think that logic will work?
A: I think that is for the telcos to decide. They made a lot of noise. I haven’t seen a payment application in with the RBI as yet. I saw something in the paper that we want this concession, if those concessions are given to the banks we can even do equally if not better job.
Q: You never thought of tying up with anybody?
A: We did but it doesn’t work. The pie is not large enough for two people to share. Then each one is saying this is my customer and this is my customer. We actually came up with a joint plan on which we spent a lot of time with Vodafone three years back to launch a better version of M-Pesa which we did. I personally went and visited the villages. Then when we went to the second step we got into issues of sharing the money because the pie wasn't large enough.
Anyway we have done our bit, everybody will have a bank account. So, if they all have a bank account then what is the payment bank going to do?
Q: Let me come to another issue which of course the market wants to repeatedly hear about – the FIPB. Have you any assurance that they will grandfather the clause and allow you to have more FII investments, not treat HDFC as a foreign account. What is the way forward?
A: This is the new India now. You have to think differently. Grandfathering is only one of the options. If you want to promote FII and FDI into the country the plethora of rules that we have is so confusing and I hope somebody understands the logic behind. If FII is coming into our country why should there be any limit at all? They are investing money here under our rules and regulations without asking for management control, I frankly think there should be no limitations.
The little that I have discussed with various parties who would be involved in this decision seems to suggest that the general feeling is that we should have a far more liberal regime so that money comes in both FII and FDI. So, I am very hopeful that the end result that we want would be achieved whether it is through grandfathering, whether it is through a liberalisation of the policy I really don’t know.
Q: Do you think you will know one way or the other in a month, in two months?
A: I would say within that timeframe yes.
Q: What if it was negative?
A: I will do a simultaneous issue, one local, one overseas.
Q: Do you need capital now?
A: We don’t need it now but if the rate of growth increases and now Basel III is imposing more and more conditions we would may be need it in 9-12 months or 9-18 months depending upon the rate of growth. So, there is no immediate need. Our total capital adequacy is 16 percent plus and tier-I is 11 percent plus. So, we will need it at some stage, we are just being careful.
Q: I agree with you actually it is not 80 quarters of 20 percent growth it is 80 quarters of 25 percent plus growth but in the last four quarters you have come down towards 21 percent. Will the base be this kind of a showstopper or at least slow you down or do you think you will overcome even that? You overcame it for 20 years will you yet overcome it?
A: Our performance has not altered at all. When we were making 25 percent the GDP for the country was 7.5 percent. I assure you at 7.5 percent GDP growth rate we will make more than 25 percent but to expect me to make the same at 7.5 percent and 4.7 percent I think you would agree there is something a miss in the maths, right? So, the slowdown is because there is a general slowdown in the economy.
Even within that I could still press and make 25 percent but I don’t want to push the envelope because we have the capacity even this. We don’t have bad debts, we have expanded our distribution but we normally don’t like to push the envelope and try and force growth. So, our normal basis for growth is real GDP X 3 is what the system grows at and we gain market share of 4-6 percent. I assure you and anybody else who wants to hear that, that is intact.
Q: Many CEOs I speak to say the vibes are good but on the table I have nothing to tell you that I will grow faster next quarter.
A: I wouldn’t necessarily agree with that. Let us put it differently, if we step back nobody has a magic wand that it is going to happen overnight. So, say we were at 4.7 percent, we had low hanging fruits and we have lot of actions that have to be taken for the long run. If we take the low hanging fruit in terms of getting the stuck projects going, getting faster decision making, getting clearer policies, restricting expenditure and defining what is going to happen plus a stable rupee, I think that has happened. So, we have probably touched the bottom and we are recovering.
We expect this fiscal the growth to be around 5.5 percent. We really don’t expect new investment demand. There are some brownfields like the motorcycle guys expanding or the consumer durable guys expanding but we don’t really expect Greenfield investment for at least another 12 months because even with the changed sentiment and everybody being positive from the time you conceive a project to the time it hits GDP it is going to be 12-18 months.
So, next year we are seeing it around 6 percent and 7 percent or thereabouts only comes year after next.
Q: The latest RBI numbers for the sector itself is still 13.
A: They went down to 11.8 but I think 13 is about the normalised number. I think you will see pickup in credit growth every quarter but not a dramatic pickup.
Q: We are done with the worst you think?
A: I think so.
Q: What do you make of this wilful defaulter clause and the strengthening of hands of bankers? Will that be a great stick to wield and may be arm twist borrowers?
A: A combination of statement of intent by the governor as well as the ministry of finance that bankers money is to be returned is the first step which is great. They followed it up with action. RBI came up with the stressed asset I, stressed asset II basically sending a signal we are monitoring what you are doing and we want a) the banks to recognise problems faster and b) to resolve them faster. The third statement that nobody has a divine right to continue with the project, if he can't run it he has to move out and his equity is to be written off according to chapter 11, I think you are seeing that. So, you are seeing the wilful defaulter example. You are seeing people selling off their assets so that they can pay loans, you are seeing people accessing the capital markets so that they can pay. I would say we are seeing progress, we will probably need to tighten further because ultimately we need a much lower level of NPAs going forward and a clear understanding and a quicker resolution. I think they are determined to do that and that is a combination of change in procedures, law and faster action.
Q: What about market development itself? He certainly tried a lot in terms of market development in the 1-14 day term money market. Do you think all that is working easy in the right direction? Will we have a better yield curve some time soon?
A: Banks have more than one day money, they have 15 day money. But most of them only want to deal in the call market. So, he has been trying this 14 days, 30 days may be wants to extend it to 90 days but a large percentage is just the bank dealing with the RBI, within each other that dealing has not started. He will have to take a number of steps before it will reach but if you are talking about the debt market then we are a long way off from a debt market.
Q: What more pieces do you want, everybody has stated reiterated their allegiance to creating a bond market. I have heard it for 12 years but what is the piece that is missing?
A: I think it took Dr Reddy to tell me this in Hong Kong. The problem is the fiscal deficit of the government. If you take household savings at about 12 percent and invest it in financial assets, corporate at about 8-10 percent the fiscal deficit of centre and states combined is 10 percent. So, there is very little leftover. You add to that the fact that most of this gets tide in SLR which you will held and buy so there is no trading and so you can't have price discovery. Since 90 percent of the issuance is government securities they only issue 10 years. 75 percent is in 10 years, 15 securities have 90 percent, part of it is held to maturity and the government deficit is not reducing.
Now with the help of lower oil price hopefully greater divestment if we bring the fiscal deficit to 3 percent or below then I remember discussing with Dr Reddy at that point of time, there was a time actually that given the deposit growth there would not have been enough government securities. Add on top of that the key question Dr Reddy asked me, he said you have written all this mechanics about debt market but Mr Puri where is the investor? It is not as of there is money sloshing around. All surplus money, term money is being utilised whether it is insurance or pension or any other long term between the fiscal deficit and other instruments. An arbitrage free yield curve and a proper issuance of government securities and trading starts from that fiscal deficit.
Q: Do you think infra bonds will be some kind of a bridge?
A: Infra bond is very good. The RBI recognising that if you are not going have a bond market for two to three years and the banks are going to be financing infra why go round and round the mulberry bush creating IIFL and all those people and then the bank funding it. So they are basically saying we will allow you term money without statutory liquidity ratio (SLR), cash reserve ratio (CRR) so that the price is right.
Q: So you might get something of a bond market because ultimately people trust a bank issue, CD's have a better market than any other instrument.
A: So you will have a bond market. Instead of corporate bonds being 10 percent of the market they will become 15 percent of the market. However, unless you have an arbitrage free sovereign yield curve and from the yield curve you need to create the derivatives and the derivatives can't be created on a simple bond but one step at a time.
Q: Inflation, are you hopeful that now all the pieces are falling in place. Three, four years ago or for the past three, four years an onion or a tomato or one vegetable potato inflation could easily become a generalised food inflation and then a general inflation. It's happened four times and now the governor is insisting that I want fight and win this battle once and for all. You think the ingredients are in place that this time around we are all likely to win.  
A: I hope so. God has also helped us; Brent is down to sub USD 100 per barrel so that is going to be one help. However, this food one I am really not sure anybody knows what happens, it's just those two three months its picks up. So they are making all the efforts. The governor is in the right trajectory in saying we have got to lick it. If we don't lick it there is no point carrying on and coming up with other measures and saying this will be controlled. We have to have a clear idea. He has reached the 8 percent on consumer price index (CPI) and 6 percent on wholesale price index (WPI) and with just oil not going up you will probably reach 7 percent and then if food comes right you will reach the 6 percent.
Q: Would you agree with his position that we have to win this battle once and for all?  
A: I agree with both his positions, not only that we have to win this battle. I don't think the impediment to investment today is a 25 basis point cut in the policy rate. Interest rate is not the key, there are whole lot of other things which you are aware of, I can repeat them if you want but it will be waste of time. So, I agree with both his statements that it is not the impediment. In any case as of today we have got the call rate lower than the repo rate. So there is enough money in the market. So what are we talking about, why do we keep focusing again and again on interest rate, can we get our infrastructure, our environment, our coal and all of that sorted out and I assure you with a good governor who is respected all over the place, I just came back from London and Tokyo, the monetary policy is in good hands and is not the crucial part for the revival as yet.
Q: This infra bonds gave us the idea that HDFC could issue a lot of infra bonds if it became a bank like IDFC is expected to. You have said clearly that infra bonds makes it attractive. What should we assume, how many years must we wait before this giant can become one and actually become the biggest player in the country, which it needs to be?
A: This is not a new issue. We have always said that an HDFC, HDFC Bank merger makes sense from a business point of view. Are they regulatory constraints, yes. With the infra bond we have made progress but we haven’t solved all the problems. So a few more regulatory constraints on the static balance sheet of HDFC if that was exempted you would see it fast. At the moment it is not on the table.
Q: One of the fears of the investors that now that you are going to be there for another six years for sure actually the merger gets postponed because there are too many good men in the organisation and therefore merging probably somebody will not be around. Therefore actually extension of your tenure is seen as postponement of merger, good analysis?
A: Very bad analysis. Let us say there is place for all and even the place at the top – no issue. That is the least of the issues. We are very clear if it comes about how it will be run. Unfortunately we need some help and the day we get the help I assure you the hypothesis that you have drawn out that it was wrong will be proven.
Q: Do you definitely need changes in the law before the merger happens or do you think that you will have sufficient number of infra bonds?
A: We don’t need changes in the law, we just need RBI to give a few concessions.
Q: If IDFC happens and you know for a fact that IDFC got these concessions ….
A: Then we will look at it. If it makes sense we will do it.
Q: How would you rate the first year, what is the hit and what is the miss?
A: You want me to rate the governor? You must be joking. I respect Bimal Jalan and I will go by his judgement which was a 10.

100 days of Vishal Sikka: Infosys stock climbs up 16.12% in three monthsInfosys
(What goes in Sikka's favour…)
When its founder NR Narayana Murthy returned to revive plunging profits and dampened spirits in 2013, Infosys was debunked as a 'family business' by many. Little did its critics know, that in less than a year's time, Infosys would witness a massive change and will begin charting a new course under its first ever non-founder CEO. The appointment and anointment of Vishal Sikka, formally working with SAP, was heralded as the arrival of a much-needed change that Infosys needed - both in its thinking and ideology.
It's been three months since Infosys named Vishal Sikka as its first non-founder CEO although he formally took charge only on August 1. Since the announcement on June 12, Sikka's approval rating on the stock market has been on a steady climb gaining as much as 16.12%. While most other IT companies have also seen a similar rise during this period, what marks in his favour is the contrast in performance of Infosys stock three months prior to the announcement when it reported a 0.51% fall while most peers moved up.

Some of the 80 IAF aircraft involved in relief and rescue operations across the flooded Srinagar city have suffered minor damage after they were targeted by stone pelters but the security personnel say they "won't give up" till help reaches all.

"There have been incidents when the helicopters flying at low altitude were targeted with stones and one of the helicopter was in fact hit by several stones causing some minor damage on the body and near the rotary wings," a senior air force officer told PTI.
The officer said that the helicopter, however, returned safely to the base where the damage was being assessed. The army too says that some of its boats deployed for relief and rescue operations were attacked by stone pelters.
"It is unfortunate that the people who are trying to save them are being attacked, but we will not give up and will continue with our work till help does not reach to every single soul," said air marshal SB Deo, director general of air operations.
There have been reports that at certain places people are being instigated by separatists to target and disrupt the relief and rescue work being undertaken by the air force and the army.

Deo said that he could understand that there was anger amongst the people and he has empathy for those who lost everything in the floods.
Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah too has condemned the targeting of the army and air force personnel who are engaged in the relief and rescue operations across the Valley and appealed to the "disruptive elements" to allow these operations.
"These disruptive elements are fishing in the troubled waters, they must not become impediments in the relief and rescue work being carried out by different agencies. "They will get plenty of time afterwards," Abdullah said.

Besides these, as many as 8,200 blankets and 1,119 tents have been provided to the flood victims, he said, adding, 80 medical teams of the Armed Forces Medical Services are already operating in full swing.
Four field hospitals have been established in Avantipur, Pattan, Anantnag and Old Airfield where medical aid is being provided to the ailing people, he said, adding that till now, they have treated more than 22,500 patients.
Union home secretary Anil Goswami, who is monitoring the rescue and relief operations met CM Abdullah on Saturday.
 
Goswami, who is camping in Srinagar for the past two days, had earlier held a series of meetings with the officials of Indian Army, Indian Air force, state administration and other agencies engaged in the relief and rescue works.

Jhelum River: From revered to being feared#jammu and kashmir floods #jhelum river #feared #revered #encroachment
Srinagar: It has been revered as the lifeline of Kashmir Valley, but River Jehlum has in the last fortnight revealed its most horrific face, unseen by generations, as it ravaged a large part of Srinagar city.
Experts feel that encroachment of water bodies, unplanned urban development and failure to put in place effective flood control measures during all these years are to be blamed for the huge impact of the calamity.
Thousands of Kashmiri families depend on Jehlum, which originates from a natural spring in South Kashmir's Verinag town, for their livelihood. The Pandit community worships its as the "mother river" and it was once considered the calmest river in the state.
River Jehlum has in the last fortnight revealed its most horrific face as it ravaged a large part of Srinagar city.
"The livelihoods of many Kashmiris directly or indirectly depend on this river. This river provides them with fish that they sell to sustain their families. Sand extraction from the river bed is a huge business here," said Javid Ahmed an environmentalist.
Not a single person in Kashmir remembers having seen this fiery face of the river in their lifetime. The recorded history of Kashmir too shows that a similar deluge had hit the valley more than a century ago.
"The rulers of the erstwhile princely state of Jammu and Kashmir were farsighted as they constructed flood channels to divert the water in case of a flood. The city was planned in a way to make sure that there was least possible damage in case of extreme flooding," said Murtaza Ahmed, a retired professor of history who now lives in Bagat Barzullah area.
Experts in Kashmir hold the unplanned urban development in and around the Srinagar city responsible for the floods last weeks flood.
They say that people have encroached upon the wetlands and water bodies, which could otherwise have reduced the impact such a flood.
"Had there been no encroachments on the wetlands and the water bodies, the impact of the flood would have been minimum, these water bodies were supposed to reduce the impact of floods," said Professor Murtaza.
The residents here say that the river which was once being worshipped as the "life giver" has today turned into "life taker" and speaking about it, brings fear.
Experts say that they had warned the administration several times to take precautionary measures towards flood control, but their advices were ignored.
"Our former Union minister for water resources is from Kashmir and he knew that we were sitting on a time bomb, but he too failed to act," said Professor Murtaza.
Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said that a comprehensive action plan for flood control in Kashmir was pending with the central government.
"A Rs 2200-crore flood management plan has already been lying with the government and we still await its approval," Omar said.

BJP president congratulates ABVP on its victory in DUSUpollsPress Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: September 13, 2014 4:07 pm
BJP President Amit Shah on Saturday congratulated the Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad for sweeping the Delhi University Students’ Union elections by winning all the four posts after a gap of 18 years.
“I congratulate ABVP for winning all 4 panels in DUSU elections. The students & Karyakartas of DU deserve the credit,” tweeted Shah, who is in Madhya Pradesh.
BJP Secretary Shrikant Sharma termed the ABVP’s stunning victory a result of the “positive approach” of the party. He said this indicates that the youth of the country are in favour of the BJP policies.
He added that the youth were the future of the country and the dream of ‘Ek Bharat, Shreshta Bharat’ would be achieved through them.
The ABVP, the students’ wing of the BJP, won all posts of president, vice president, secretary and joint secretary, bettering last year’s performance when it had lost one of the seats to the National Students Union of India (NSUI).
Mohit Nagar was elected president of DUSU while Pravesh Malik won the elections for vice president’s post. Kanika Shekhawat and Ashutosh Mathur have been elected as secretary and joint secretary respectively.

PTI | Mumbai | Posted: September 13, 2014 3:52 pm | Updated: September 14, 2014 4:16 am
Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray Saturday expressed his desire to occupy the chief minister’s post in Maharashtra, which is going to polls on October 15.
Thackeray, who was participating in a programme in Mumbai hosted by a TV channel, said, “I don’t day-dream or hanker for power. But if I get an opportunity to head the state, I will not shy away from the responsibility.”
“In the Lok Sabha polls, the people of India wanted change. Narendra Modi emerged as an alternative face, which was acceptable to the people.
Similarly, in Maharashtra, the people are looking for a change. If people repose their confidence in me, I will surely lead the state,” the Shiv Sena president said while fielding questions from other participants in the programme. “After all, I am son of Bal Thackeray. I have always firmly stood for a cause and delivered results. I have never run away from any responsibilities,” he said.
On the seat-sharing negotiations with the ally BJP, Thackeray said, “There is nothing like big brother or small brother. We believe each alliance partner should be treated with dignity and given their due.”
Taking a dig at his rivals (read MNS chief Raj Thackeray), he said, “Even I live along the seashore. I have seen waves rolling. I am used to taking waves in my stride. I don’t run away from problems.”
The Sena and BJP, which entered into an alliance 25 years ago, had set a formula that whichever of the two parties won more seats in the Assembly polls would stake the claim for chief ministerial post.
Chavan to fight maiden Assembly election from Karad South, says Wife Pune
CM Prithviraj Chavan is set to contest the upcoming Assembly polls from Karad South constituency in Satara district, his wife Satvasheela Chavan told the The Sunday Express. The CM, a member of the Legislative Council who will be fighting Assembly polls for the first time, is said to have been looking for a safe seat. Satvasheela, who was in Pimpri on Saturday to conduct a workshop for women Congress workers, said she had already been campaigning in the constituency. Though Karad South is considered to be a safe seat, Chavan may have a problem at hand. For 20 years now, the seat has been represented by Vikaskaka Patil Undalkar of the Congress, who is reportedly not ready to drop out of the race.

Fed rate shift could spook marketsFed rate shift could spook markets

Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen. (Susan Walsh, AP)
A new worry is brewing on Wall Street: a potential change in the Federal Reserve’s message that could spark fear of a speeded-up timetable for interest rate hikes next year.
Low rates have been a key driver of the stock market rally that began more than five years ago and that has delivered gains of almost 200% for investors that stayed the course after the worst bear market since the Great Depression. But the Fed has already started the process of taking its foot off the so-called “stimulus accelerator.” It is on track to phase out its monthly bond purchases, or quantitative easing, next month. And after that comes the inevitable move to start hiking short-interest rates, currently pegged at 0% to 0.25%, and back toward more normal levels.
The market angst centers around the timing of the first rate hike (the last rate hike was in December 2006) and the pace and size of subsequent hikes. Wall Street has been betting on the first rate hike sometime in the first half of 2015 or perhaps later.
But now there’s concern that investors have misread the Fed’s intentions, guidance and future economic projections. That’s leading to rising worry that the first hike could come much sooner — perhaps as early as the first quarter of 2015. Such a move is likely to cause a negative reaction in the stock market, according to UBS.
Anxiety is rising ahead of the Fed’s policy meeting next week, when it will cap its two-day powwow Wednesday with a policy statement and a faceoff between Fed chair Janet Yellen and reporters in a news conference.
The big fear is that the Fed will remove its “considerable time” language from its latest policy statement. They have been using this phrase to better telegraph the timing of its first rate hike. The Fed has said its initial rate increase won’t come until a “considerable time” after it ends its QE program this fall. If that market-friendly language is removed or tweaked, it is likely the market will start to price in earlier rate hikes, which could create a fresh headwind for stocks.
The recent questioning of Wall Street expectations about the Fed’s next moves has been driven by a swifter-than-expected job market recovery this year and better incoming economic data. But what really got investors to rethink their views on  rates was a paper released Monday by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco that concluded that investors were misreading the Fed and its rate-hike timetable. “Our evidence indicates that the public seems to expect more accommodative monetary policy than the Fed’s (projections) suggest,” the authors concluded.
See Friday’s America’s Market’s blog post for more on the paper’s findings.
Capturing the market’s rising Fed-related angst was a research report released Wednesday night by UBS credit strategist Matthew Mish titled, “Fed Fear Factor.”
The report notes that the September Fed meeting has a chance of being a “market-moving event.”
The reason: While the Fed’s own projections for “the pace” and timing of rate hikes has “increased since the summer,” market expectations appear “out-of-sync” with the Fed’s thinking.
In short: The market might not be prepared for a rate hike that comes sooner rather than later.
Mish lays out three possible scenarios, the probability of each occurring, and the potential impact on stocks and bonds.
1. No change to policy statement (60% odds). Under this scenario, the Fed would keep the “considerable time” language and keep its prior guidance intact.
Market impact: stocks rally, bonds rally moderately and yields fall.
2. Fed removes “considerable time” language (15% odds). “This is less likely,” says Mish. “There is simply too much risk in removing this language at this time. However, if it were to occur we would anticipate the language to be replaced by other, economically conditional language … and to also include the phrase “The change in the (Fed’s) guidance does not indicate any change in the (Fed’s) policy intentions.”
Market impact: knee-jerk downside reaction for stocks, while bonds sell off, causing a “significant” rise in bond yields.
3. Fed introduces language to bring market more inline with its current thinking (25% odds).  A more likely scenario is the Fed “adding language to nudge the market’s forecast for the pace of tightening … closer to the (Fed) forecasts,” says Mish. “The further the market is from (Fed) member expectations of policy tightening, the more risk there is of an unwanted large and messy market response to the coming change in Fed policy.”
Market impact: While stocks’ “initial reaction is expected to flatline under such a scenario, ratification of the (Fed’s) confidence in the solidity of growth would cause stocks’ second reaction to be a resumption of the rally,” Mish wrote.

Reliance Industries Gas Field Investments Depend on Acceptable Pricing: NikoSuzuki to Increase Market Share in Motorcycles Segment to 5%
New Delhi: Reliance Industries ' $10 billion investment in new fields off the East Coast depends on the government approving an acceptable gas price, its junior partner Niko Resources has said.
RIL has an array of natural gas discoveries in the Krishna Godavari basin KG-D6 block as well as NEC-25 area off the Odisha coast and it along with its partners BP Plc of UK and Niko has detailed plans to bring them to production in the next few years.
Canada's Niko Resources in its annual general meeting (AGM) presentation on Thursday stated that "planned development projects in India (are) dependent on acceptable gas pricing".
While the previous UPA government had approved a formula that would have doubled natural gas rates to $8.4 per million British thermal unit, the current dispensation is reviewing it and is likely to take a decision by the end of the month.
Niko said final investment decisions on developing R-Series gas fields as well as satellite discoveries in KG-D6 block are "waiting on favourable resolution of gas price".
The partners say new field developments are economically unviable at the current price of $4.2.
With a decision on gas price hike, which was due on April 1, being delayed, Niko said it along with RIL and BP had in May field an "arbitration seeking market pricing as per terms of D6 Block PSC".
On Thursday, BP India head Sashi Mukundan said the delay in gas price hike implementation was frustrating and was holding back investments.
"We are ready to go ahead with our first project which is probably a $4 billion project. We are getting ready to potentially move that forward (but) are waiting for the gas price decision. So is that frustration, yes because it was decided last June 2013," he had stated.
The UPA government had in June 2013 approved a new gas pricing formula, which would have doubled the rate on its implementation from April 1, 2014.
The formula was notified in January 2014 but the Oil Ministry delayed announcement of a new rate, during which time general elections were announced and Election Commission asked the government to postpone implementation of the decision till the completion of polls.
The price hike, which was postponed to June 30, was again put off by another three months by the new government pending a comprehensive review.
The government has formed a four-member panel of secretaries to suggest a new gas pricing mechanism. The report of the committee is expected in next few days.
As of 2:32 p.m., shares in Reliance Industries were trading at Rs 1015.50 apiece on the BSE, down 0.32 per cent from the previous close.

Northern League seeks Scotland vote boostSeptember 12, 2014 8:39 am
Italy’s Northern League looks to Scotland vote for separation push
By Rachel Sanderson in Milan
©AFP
Italy’s anti-immigrant, anti-euro Northern League party is seizing on the Scottish vote for independence as an opportunity to “relaunch the battle” for secession of the north of Italy, planning a mass rally and stepping up its confrontation with Rome over its push for a referendum in the wealthy Veneto region.
The Northern League was founded 30 years ago calling for the recreation of a mythical Celtic state in northern Italy, known as Padania.

Germany’s anti-euro AfD extends its electoral gains
Its national influence is much weaker than when the party was a key partner in the successive governments of former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. However, it retains a stronghold in Italy’s richest regions in the north, with populist campaigning centred on immigrant bashing and pledges to protect its economic wealth from Italy’s “thieving” south.
Matteo Salvini , the 41-year-old leader of the Northern League, told the Financial Times that Scotland’s vote on September 18 on whether to sever its 307-year union with England was “a great boost for all movements for autonomy and identity in Europe, from Catalonia , to Flemish, to the Bretons and the Padanians”.
“The fact the vote is taking place at all is a positive thing for us in Padania. We are going relaunch the battle for independence,” he said, adding he intended to use Scotland’s vote as leverage to step up pressure on the government of Matteo Renzi to allow the northern region of Veneto its own referendum on independence.
“I’m convinced we are also going to be one of the protagonists in a historic period of change which is going to see the economic and geographic borders of Europe rewritten over the next few years,” he added.
The Northern League took 6.15 per cent of the national vote in the European elections in May, a tiny fraction of the 40 per cent won by prime minister Matteo Renzi’s Democratic Party but more than expected after a campaign focused on bashing the euro and immigrant. The League won nearly 12 per cent of the vote in the north west of Italy and 10 per cent of the vote in the north east.
Its stronghold is the Veneto, one of the most wealthy areas in Europe, where the League typically takes at least a third of the votes. The governor, Luca Zaia, is a vocal League member who frequently rails against European banks, Brussels, immigrants and national institutions.
Mr Salvini said the League planned a mass rally of “militants” at the town of Cittadella, a stronghold of the League in the Veneto three days after the Scottish vote.
“In 20 years of our battle for federalism the Italian state has never given us a chance to vote in a referendum. We maintain that Italy as an idea needs a re-evaluation, that is several different countries, but with the Renzi government we are seeing even more power returning to the central state,” he said.
At dawn on April 2 this year, Italy’s antiterrorist squad raided a shed in a field outside Verona and found a homemade armoured vehicle equipped with a small cannon. Police arrested 24 people, including eight in Verona, in Veneto, under antiterrorist laws and accused them of sedition and possession of armed weapons.
Among the allegations from the authorities was that L’Alleanza, or the Alliance group, which is also pushing for independence for Veneto, planned to use the homemade tank for the “liberation” of Venice’s popular St Mark’s Square in the run-up to the European elections.
“Extremists? It was a ridiculous situation. Those people didn’t hurt anyone. If there’s anything wrong with our extremists it is that they are too moderate, that they are too peaceful,” Mr Salvini said.

Ford to Launch Four New Car Models in India Over 18-20 MonthsUS-Based Gilead Licenses Hepatitis C Drug to Cipla, Ranbaxy, 5 Others
New Delhi:
Ford Motor Co plans to launch four new car models in India and is looking to increase the amount of locally-made parts to reduce the cost of its vehicles sold in the country, the head of its local unit said on Friday.
Foreign carmakers such as Ford, Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co are lining up new car models in India on hopes of a pickup in demand after sales fell for two consecutive years in a slowing economy.
Car sales in the country are expected to grow by 5-10 per cent this fiscal year. Also, India is expected to become the world's third-largest passenger car market by 2018, moving up from sixth place today, according to IHS Automotive.
"Within the next 18-20 months we plan to launch four new models in India," Nigel Harris, president of Ford India, told Reuters in an interview.
While Harris declined to give details, Ford had showcased a compact version of its Figo car, already sold in India, at the Delhi auto show earlier this year and he said there is "a pretty strong indication that it is the right product."
Ford's sales in India have increased 9.5 per cent to 84,469 vehicles in the fiscal year that ended on March 31, pushing up its market share to 3.4 per cent from 2.9 per cent a year ago, industry data showed.
The US carmaker had said in 2010 it would launch 8 vehicle models, based on its global car platforms, in India by the end of 2015, a target the company is unlikely to meet due to the economic slowdown and sluggish car sales.
"We will be close to that, but a couple of the models will be deferred by a couple of years," said Harris.
Ford continues to increase the sourcing of components from India in cars that will help reduce the vehicle cost, he said.
The company exports a third of the cars it makes in India, and aims to push that to almost half over the next five years. It currently exports to 37 countries from India and plans to increase that to 50 over the same period, Harris added.

Ask Matt: Which real-estate bets pay bestAFP/Getty
Q: Which real-estate bets pay off most?
A: Real-estate is one of the reasons why the stock market is doing so great. How? Real-estate investment trusts are among the standout performers this year.
The Vanguard Real-Estate Investment Trust exchange-traded fund, which owns some of the largest REITs, is up roughly 18% this year. That’s a powerful gain, well above the 8% rise by the Standard & Poor’s 500. And don’t forget that REITs are paying an unadjusted effective yield of roughly 3.6%. That’s well above the current dividend yield of the S&P 500, which is running slightly below 2%.
Chart source: MSN Money
But there are certainly real-estate investment trusts that are paying off better than others. The highest yielding company in the real-estate industry group in the S&P 500 is HCP (HCP) , which invests in real property used primarily by health care companies. The REIT is yielding an impressive 5.1%, says S&P Capital IQ. Right behind HCP for the highest yielding REIT is Health Care REIT (HCN) , which also owns property used in medical uses including senior care. Health Care REIT is yielding 4.8%. And rounding out the top three is Ventas (VTR) , which is also involved in medical-use property. It’s yielding 4.5%. Given the attractiveness of REITs and their dividends, they are a good fit for most balanced portfolios.

Automotive Mission Plan 2016 Targets to be Missed by up to 25%: ReportUS-Based Gilead Licenses Hepatitis C Drug to Cipla, Ranbaxy, 5 Others
New Delhi:
The economic slowdown in the last three years that resulted in a demand slump will force the Indian auto industry to miss by up to 25 per cent of the targets set in ambitious Automotive Mission Plan (AMP) 2016.
The auto industry had set an ambitious target under the AMP 2006-2016 to take its annual turnover to $145 billion with special emphasis on export of small cars, MUVs, two and three wheelers and auto components.
"Based on the expected growth rate for the remaining period of AMP 2016, the overall performance of the industry will be short of the targets by around 20 to 25 per cent," according to the review of AMP 2006-2016.
The review was conducted by ACMA and SIAM's independent knowledge partner ICRA Management Consulting Services (IMaCS).
Explaining the reasons for falling short of targets, it said: "The sluggish macro-economic factors during the last three years have led to a significant slowdown, which is amongst the worst that the India automotive industry has witnessed."
This has impacted the pace and growth resulting in under-achievement of some of the targets envisaged in AMP 2016, while a few more are on course to be achieved by end of 2016.
"However, this shortfall can be reduced to around 13 to 17 per cent if the government supports demand through a few interventions," it added.
The review called for continuation of current excise duty rates for cars, two-wheelers, commercial vehicles and lowering of excise duty on key components. It also highlighted the importance of fleet modernisation scheme, quick roll out of
next phase of JNNURM, ban of overloading and strict enforcement of the same, to help achieve the AMP 2016 target.
The review further said the government must also facilitate affordable vehicle finance and provide support for exports of automobiles through dedicated promotion schemes.
As per the AMP 2006-2016 announced in 2006, a goal was set for India to become the "destination of choice in the world for the design and manufacture of automobiles and auto components with output reaching a level of $145 billion
accounting for more than 10 per cent of GDP and providing additional employment to 25 million people by 2016".
The review said already the government has already started working on the next phase of AMP 2016-26 so as to address the unfinished agenda and new target initiatives keeping in mind the current expected market dynamics.
"While the last decade was predominantly driven by domestic demand, going forward industry geared up to meet both domestic and global demand," it said.

Court Rejects PIL Challenging Land Alottment to Larsen and Toubro
Press Trust of India | Updated On: September 12, 2014 22:11 (IST)
Suzuki to Increase Market Share in Motorcycles Segment to 5%
Ahmedabad: The Gujarat High Court on Friday rejected a petition challenging the allocation of 160 hectares of land to Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T) in Hazira area of Gujarat's Surat district.
A division bench of justices Akil Kureshi and J B Pardiwala rejected the PIL since it was filed after a delay of around seven years after allocation of the last chunk of land measuring 80 hectares.
Petitioner Mohammed Rehmat Khan challenged allocation of 160 hectares of land to L&T at Hazira in Surat.
"In fact, almost six chunks of land have been allotted to L&T and around 80 hectares whose market price was more than Rs 2,600 per square metre was allotted at a rate of Rs 700 and 80 more hectares were allotted at a price of Re 1 per square metre," the petitioner had claimed in his PIL.
As per the petitioner's advocate, chunks of land were first allocated in 1983 and then in 2006. The PIL demanded the cancellation of land allotment to L&T and an independent inquiry to probe anomalities in the land allocation.
However, L&T contended that the first allocation of land was done in the year 1983 to promote industries in Gujarat.
On behalf of L&T, senior advocate Sudheer Nanavati submitted that the company was given 30 per cent discount while allocating 80 hectares of land for Rs 700 per square, as against its market rate of Rs 925 per square metre.
This discount was given because the L&T unit was the only manufacturing unit producing equipment for nuclear plants and defence purposes, Mr Nanavati had submitted. He raised the point of delay in filing the PIL and said that the last allocation was made in 2006, while the petitioner challenged it only in the year 2013.
The Gujarat government maintained that land allocation was done as per provisions of the law and no favour was made to any industrial house.
After hearing arguments of all sides, the High Court rejected the PIL and disposed of the case.

Monitor Infra Projects Electronically: PM to MinistersHSBC Sees Higher India Growth, Lower Inflation in Coming Quarters
New Delhi: Seeking to push infrastructure development, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday asked his ministers to electronically monitor the progress of projects and directed the Railways to submit a comprehensive plan for encouraging FDI.
"Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasised the importance for monitoring the progress of infrastructure development through efficiency parameters which have been identified for each of the sectors."
"He said that Ministries should monitor them on electronic reporting formats," an official statement said.
The instructions followed monthly review of the progress of eight major infrastructure sectors - civil aviation, ports and inland waterways, railway, roads, telecom, power, coal, and new and renewable energy.
Mr Modi said accelerated infrastructure development was his top priority, and stressed the need for creating world-class infrastructure in India.
Reviewing the progress of the Railways sector, he said, "Railways has been granted clearance for 100 percent FDI, and therefore the Railways should come up with a comprehensive plan for facilitating FDI in the sector."
He also stressed that initiatives undertaken by state governments as well as PSUs with other countries, including SAARC nations, should also be taken into account while monitoring the progress of infrastructure sectors.
Reviewing the Shipping Ministry's performance, Mr Modi said the Sagarmala project should lead to port-led development, and become a major link element for his "Make in India" vision, which envisaged a quantum jump in India's global trade.
Mr Modi had said earlier that his government had conceived 'Sagarmala', envisaging not merely port development, but port-led development which would include ports, SEZs, rail, road, air and waterway connectivity with the hinterland, including linkages of cold storage and warehousing facilities.
The PMO has asked the ministry to expedite the project.
Re-emphasising the need to push renewable energy, he called for a solar-powered corridor along the India-Pakistan border, in the desert regions of Rajasthan and Gujarat. Two pilot projects of 5 MW each are being initiated for this.
Referring to his vision on solid waste management and waste water management in 500 towns through the PPP model, the Prime Minister said bio-energy would be a vital element of this vision.
Mr Modi also called for provision of world-class utility facilities along new road projects to bring about a paradigm shift in India's global perception.
"All the sectors broadly reported significant improvement in performance over the last four months, as compared to the previous year," the statement said.New Delhi: Seeking to push infrastructure development, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday asked his ministers to electronically monitor the progress of projects and directed the Railways to submit a comprehensive plan for encouraging FDI.
"Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasised the importance for monitoring the progress of infrastructure development through efficiency parameters which have been identified for each of the sectors."
"He said that Ministries should monitor them on electronic reporting formats," an official statement said.
The instructions followed monthly review of the progress of eight major infrastructure sectors - civil aviation, ports and inland waterways, railway, roads, telecom, power, coal, and new and renewable energy.
Mr Modi said accelerated infrastructure development was his top priority, and stressed the need for creating world-class infrastructure in India.
Reviewing the progress of the Railways sector, he said, "Railways has been granted clearance for 100 percent FDI, and therefore the Railways should come up with a comprehensive plan for facilitating FDI in the sector."
He also stressed that initiatives undertaken by state governments as well as PSUs with other countries, including SAARC nations, should also be taken into account while monitoring the progress of infrastructure sectors.
Reviewing the Shipping Ministry's performance, Mr Modi said the Sagarmala project should lead to port-led development, and become a major link element for his "Make in India" vision, which envisaged a quantum jump in India's global trade.
Mr Modi had said earlier that his government had conceived 'Sagarmala', envisaging not merely port development, but port-led development which would include ports, SEZs, rail, road, air and waterway connectivity with the hinterland, including linkages of cold storage and warehousing facilities.
The PMO has asked the ministry to expedite the project.
Re-emphasising the need to push renewable energy, he called for a solar-powered corridor along the India-Pakistan border, in the desert regions of Rajasthan and Gujarat. Two pilot projects of 5 MW each are being initiated for this.
Referring to his vision on solid waste management and waste water management in 500 towns through the PPP model, the Prime Minister said bio-energy would be a vital element of this vision.
Mr Modi also called for provision of world-class utility facilities along new road projects to bring about a paradigm shift in India's global perception.
"All the sectors broadly reported significant improvement in performance over the last four months, as compared to the previous year," the statement said.

JSW May Conclude Takeover of Lucchini in a Month
Press Trust of India | Updated On: September 13, 2014 00:50 (IST)
Suzuki to Increase Market Share in Motorcycles Segment to 5%
Kolkata: Sajjan Jindal-owned JSW Steel is in the final stages of negotiations to buy 'part' of bankrupt Italian steelmaker Lucchini.
"We are at an advanced stage of negotiations. We hope to close the deal in a month's time or so," JSW senior vice president (global sales) Sharad Mahendra said at the 'Steel Round Table' organised by The Bengal Chamber in Kolkata on Friday.
Lucchini is also reported to have received a binding offer from JSW Steel for its core assets in Piombino and is considering the offer.
Mr Mahendra said JSW is only keen to take over assets of one-million tonne steel rolling mill of the Italian company for steel processing and not the steel making facility.
The Piombino plant on the Tuscan coast includes a blast furnace, a steel mill, a coke plant, three re-rolling mills and facilities at the port.
According to foreign media reports, the labour union has expressed opposition to any 'piecemeal' sale.
Asked about investment in the takeover, he said, "There will be no major upfront investment. Most capital requirement would be for working capital."
He said the Italian government is keen on the transaction for sake of employment and value added products.
The deal will give JSW access to European steel market and export opportunity for semi processed steel to Europe.
"We want to export our Indian semi-steel products like billets for processing and selling in Italian and other European markets."
Meanwhile, speaking on the iron-ore issue, Mr Mahendra said supply constraints from domestic sources has forced JSW to import iron-ore from markets like Canada, South Africa and Brazil.
"We are already importing and total import of iron-ore would be 6-7 million tonne on an annual basis as things stand now," he said.
It was nil last year and most of the imports would be meant for 10 million tonne Karnataka plant, capacity of which would get ramped up to 12 million tonnes by December.

Prasoon Joshi: Hitting the right notesViveat Susan Pinto |  Mumbai Sep 13, 2014

Prasoon Joshi: Hitting the right notes
The poet-adman has been elevated to the position of Asia-Pacific head at McCann Worldgroup
Prasoon Joshi, president, South Asia, McCann Worldgroup and chief executive officer (CEO), McCann Worldgroup India, has been elevated to the Asia-Pacific head at the Interpublic Group (IPG) agency. But the poet-adman barely has the time for celebrations. "I am with my global CEO (Harris Diamond) in back-to-back client meetings. I need to concentrate on that," he says over telephone from New Delhi.
Joshi, who turns 46 on September 16, is a workaholic. It is his work ethic that has allowed him to navigate advertising and feature films. He remains among the few in the Indian advertising sector who have not had to give up their careers in pursuit of their passion. In Joshi's case, it is his love for verse, which finds expression in poems and lyrics. Joshi is also a scriptwriter, having penned the story of Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, a 2013 movie based on the life of Olympian Milkha Singh. This movie was the highest grosser after Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani in the year. Joshi took two years to write the script.
Despite this, his elevation at the agency he has been with for twelve years indicates his life beyond advertising has barely affected his role as an agency head. McCann remains among IPG's key units, giving the world's fourth-largest advertising group 40 per cent of its $7.12-billion annual revenues. Asia-Pacific for IPG is the biggest contributor to its $3.14 billion annual international revenues at 28 per cent. Continental Europe comes next at 25.4 per cent and the United Kingdom third at 18 per cent.
Joshi is aware of the responsibility he has been assigned. The management graduate from IMT, Ghaziabad, who has a master's degree in physics, said: "The responsibility the global management (at McCann) has given me is huge. I am happy they trusted me with this job.
"Indians have been finding their way to the top across sectors, advertising is one. But more than one's nationality, I think this is a reward for being a good advertising professional. That is what counts."
Joshi said he will work with the respective country heads of the agency in the region. "I intend to collaborate with them and see where I can add value."
Besides India, McCann counts markets like China, Australia, Thailand, the Philippines and Singapore as crucial. Joshi is expected to bring his creative power as well as his business acumen to the table when managing these diverse markets. Assisting him will be Charles Cadell, erstwhile India head of Lowe Lintas & Partners, and Jesse Lin, who will operate out of Singapore and Shanghai, respectively.
Joshi on his part will shuttle between Mumbai, where he will based, and markets in the region in his role as the Asia-Pacific head. The shift of the centre of gravity from west to east as Martin Sorrell, chief executive of ad group WPP, once said, seems full.

After Electrolux-GE deal  Quirky loses patent accessAfter Electrolux, GE Deal, Quirky Loses Patent Access
Electrolux to Quirky: No more patents for you!
Kori Perten
September 12, 2014
What's creative, collaborative, and lacks access to GE Appliances' patents? Until this week, crowd-source invention company Quirky would not have been an accurate response, but times have changed.
Quirky hosts a community of amateur inventors and designers who work together to bring good ideas to reality. The company then sells the resulting products. Last year, Quirky entered into a partnership with GE, which opened GE's patents to the Quirky community for use as inspiration. The two also produced a co-branded line of smart home products.
With Electrolux's purchase of GE Appliances, Quirky's ability to view and use GE’s appliance patents is no more.
But since its inception over a year ago the open-patent platform has not yielded any direct community inventions, and the loss of these patents likely won't help toward that end.
As soon as GE Appliances officially falls into the hands of Electrolux , Quirky's ability to view and use GE's appliance patents is no more. It's a blow the company initially tried to avoid by pairing with Blackstone Group to bid on GE's appliance business. But with Electrolux emerging as victor it appears there’s nothing more that can be done—well, nothing but removing some 500 patents from Quirky’s website.

Quirky CEO Ben Kaufman informed his community of the GE acquisition in a brief note , but offered only reassurance. "I want you to know that this in no way affects our business, plans, or relationship with GE," he wrote. "GE will continue to be a key partner of ours, and will continue to invest in our community and their inventions."
GE spokesman Seth Martin echoed the sentiment, assuring The Wall Street Journal's "Corporate Intelligence" blog that "GE and Quirky will continue to partner to grow connected devices, which will include home technologies in areas like automation, energy, and lighting."
"GE will continue to be a key partner of ours, and will continue to invest in our community and their inventions."
Regardless of patent access, products created through this collaboration will continue to be released, with a batch coming out this holiday season. The products will connect to the Wink app, which allows for remote control of co-branded GE and Quirky devices, among others.
Previous inventions released through the partnership will not be lost as a result of the inaccessible patents, either—although we can't imagine many are looking to purchase the Aros smart air conditioner ($279) as the summer rolls to a close. Perhaps the Pivot Power Genius ($59.99) smart power strip would be a more seasonally appropriate option?

Pennsylvania execution delayed because the state doesnt have lethal injection drugsBy Mark Berman September 12 Follow @markberman
An execution scheduled for 10 days from now in Pennsylvania has been called off because the state doesn’t have the drugs it needs to carry out the lethal injection, Gov. Tom Corbett (R) announced Friday.
But the reprieve for Hubert L. Michael Jr., who was convicted of the 1993 kidnapping and murder of a teenage girl, is only meant to be temporary, Corbett said. Corbett said in a statement that he is “committed to carrying out the sentence” for Michael and intends to set a new execution date once the state gets the execution drugs.
The Pennsylvania Department of Corrections confirmed Friday that it does not have the drugs necessary to carry out the execution, but a spokeswoman declined to provide information regarding why. This comes amid an ongoing shortage of lethal injection drugs that has left states with capital punishment scrambling to obtain them , even as some states have contemplated reviving older execution methods, such as like firing squads or gas chambers .
Corbett signed the death warrant for Michael in July, setting the execution date for Sept. 22. The execution was  temporarily stayed  by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit last month as it weighs a petition for the full court to hear Michael’s case. But if the stay is lifted, the Department of Corrections — which is responsible for carrying out death sentences, and has to do so on dates established by the governor — would then be obligated to execute Michael  by lethal injection .
“We cannot do so because we do not have the drugs,” Susan McNaughton, a spokeswoman for the Department of Corrections, said in an e-mail. “We continue to work to acquire the drugs in accordance with the law.”
When asked for additional details regarding why the department did not have the necessary drugs or when it expected to get them, McNaughton said that she could not discuss any details regarding how the drugs are obtained.
If and when the department gets the lethal drugs, John E. Wetzel, the department’s secretary, would alert Corbett’s office in writing. Barring any sort of stay, Corbett would then sign an execution warrant for Michael — the fifth death warrant bearing Michael’s name, and the third signed by Corbett — setting a new date for his execution.
Michael was convicted of abducting and shooting 16-year-old Trista Eng in York County . He was sentenced to death in 1995, the same year Pennsylvania carried out its first lethal injection, putting Keith Zettlemoyer to death. Since then, former governors Tom Ridge and Ed Rendell signed execution warrants for Michael in 1996 and 2004, respectively; Corbett also signed a warrant in 2012.
All three of these warrants wound up being dissolved after stays were issued and Michael filed a  series of appeals and motions for stays .
The state has 184 people on death row and has carried out three executions since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976; it has not executed anyone since 1999. Corbett has signed dozens of execution warrants since he took office in 2011, so there have been other executions scheduled, including one that was set for June before it was stayed .
News of Michael’s reprieve comes a day after a lawsuit was filed on behalf of media organizations demanding additional information regarding the source of the drugs that would be used in his execution. This suit said that revealing the source of the drugs “would be of intense interest to the public,” as there has been greater attention paid to executions in the United States following three problematic lethal injections this year. The American Civil Liberties Union in Pennsylvania filed the suit on behalf of the Guardian’s U.S. operation, the Philadelphia Inquirer, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and the Philadelphia City Paper.
This lawsuit followed two other suits, filed earlier this year in other states, challenging the secrecy that suffuses the lethal injection process in the United States. In May, media outlets sued the Missouri Department of Corrections to try to force it to release more details about where the state — which has executed eight people this year, tied with Texas for the most in 2014 — obtained the drugs it was using in lethal injections.
The ACLU and the Guardian’s U.S. operation filed a suit last month arguing that journalists and witnesses in Oklahoma should be allowed to see more of what happens during executions . Their suit cited a high-profile botched execution in the state , which took place with key moments shielded from view. In particular, the assembled journalists and other witnesses were unable to see the moment that the inmate, Clayton Lockett, died. Nor did they see the repeated issues involved in placing the IV  in Lockett’s vein.
A state investigation released earlier this month specifically cited issues with the IV as a major problem with that botched injection, which drew criticism from President Obama and the United Nations.

China urges central Asian neighbours to fight extremism and cyber terrorismChina, Russia and four Central Asian nations - Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan - formed the SCO in 2001 (Source: AP)
Reuters | Beijing | Posted: September 13, 2014 9:26 am | Updated: September 13, 2014 12:47 pm
China’s President Xi Jinping urged Central Asian states to step up the fight against religious extremism and cyber terrorism, state media said, as Beijing reaches for help across its borders in addressing security concerns in its restive Xinjiang region.
Beijing says separatist groups in the far western region of Xinjiang, home to the Muslim Uighur minority, are seeking to form their own state called East Turkestan and have links with militants in Central Asia as well as Pakistan.
The government says such separatists are influenced by militant groups’ training videos and audio from beyond its borders, though experts dispute their influence and reach.
“(We) should make concerted efforts to crack down on the ‘three evil forces’ of terrorism, extremism and separatism,” the official Xinhua news agency said late on Friday, citing Xi’s speech in Tajikistan to the heads of state of other Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) members.
“Currently, (we) should focus on combating religion-involved extremism and Internet terrorism,” Xi said, adding that the group’s Regional Counter-Terrorism Structure (RCTS) should enhance efforts to combat drug trafficking.
China, Russia and four Central Asian nations – Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan – formed the SCO in 2001 as a regional security bloc to fight threats posed by radical Islam and drug trafficking from neighbouring Afghanistan.
Many experts and rights groups say economic marginalisation of Uighurs is one of the main causes of ethnic violence that has killed hundreds of people across China in the past year and a half.
They argue that benefits of development in Xinjiang, resource-rich and strategically located on the borders of ex-Soviet central Asia, largely have gone to majority Han Chinese, stoking resentment among Uighurs.
China’s leaders have vowed to strike hard at religious militants and separatist groups.
On Friday, a Chinese court sentenced three people to death and one to life in prison for an attack at a Yunnan province train station in March in which 31 people were killed and 141 injured.
Currently, (we) should focus on combating religion-involved extremism and Internet terrorism.

Fusion foods emerge as dessert get largest p...Fusion foods make a mark as dessert play key role in restaurant menu

As per National Restaurant Association of India, Indian food services industry has seen a steady growth in past few years & will grow in next 5 years.

ET Special: All you want to know about Apple iPhone 6
NEW DELHI: Ever imagined pairing Rooh Afza with creme brulee? Or gooey marshmallows oozing out of an olden-day classic, chinni ki roti, or even a gaajar ka halwa with goat cheese? Gone are the days of fruit salad with ice cream — as India's restaurant culture evolves, chefs are getting creative with dessert, and with good reason.
It accounts for a good quarter of revenue at some outlets. The traditional is being informed by the modern. Here's a tasting menu of sweet things — molecular phirni-oxide, a Parle-G cheesecake, jalebi cavier, rasmalai tres leches and apple cinnamon jalebis.
Such concoctions garnished with a hint of molecular gastronomy are being eagerly ordered in restaurants across the country. Chefs are taking fusion food up a notch by experimenting with Indian desserts as the business expands.
According to the National Restaurant Association of India , the Indian food services industry has seen a steady growth in the past few years and is expected to grow at over 11 per cent in the next five years.
Right now the size of the industry is approximately Rs 2.5 trillion and is projected to reachRs 4.1 trillion by 2018. And one of the key factors propelling restaurant growth will be experimentation with new formats, themes and menus by innovative, entrepreneurial ventures, according to the association.
As the average food bill rises, dessert is playing a key role. Riyaaz Amlani's new restaurant Social Offline serves a fried chocolate bar, Ramesh Suresh. Manish Mehrortra's much-feted Indian Accent in Delhi is dishing out traditional desserts in a modern avatar—Gujarati suterfeni, rose chikki, home-made pistachio ice cream or the raw and ripe mango daulat ki chaat with mango candy brittle are all runaway successes.Rahul Akerkar, founder of Degustibus Hospitality, which owns the Indigo chain of restaurants, said close to 25 per cent of revenue comes from desserts. That follows since prices have gone up with the makeover and, more importantly, customers are happy to pay. Gulab jamuns can cost up to Rs 600 for a portion at some restaurants.
"Yes there is certainly a demand in the market for innovative food and these desserts fall in this category," said Akerkar. The chef created halwa creme brulee with goat cheese at Indigo and a mille-feuille with shrikhand and berries. But he emphasises that chefs should be careful they don't make a "khichdi" out of dessert. It's an interesting time to be an Indian patron, according to owners.
"There was a time when desserts were relegated to the last page of a menu," said restaurateur Zorawar Kalra , founder of Massive Restaurants. But "the kind of modern Indian desserts we are doing tend to leave a final memory for people to return to us."He's working on the concept of a mithai takeaway that should debut before the end of the year. "It's about time the Indian dessert arrives, and there is limitless potential in this concept," he said, particularly since only one in three people have dessert, according to restaurateurs.
Delhi-based Mehrotra of Indian Accent looks to British culinary alchemist Heston Blumenthal for inspiration. He's reinventing simple classics such as chini ki roti (literally sugar bread) with marshmallows besides doing a besan laddoo tart served with a side of 'mithai' cheesecake."Indian cuisine will boom again and it's time it comes out of the closet. We need a little modern twist with our traditional foods," said Mehrotra. Prices are reasonable at Delhi's Cafe Lota— apple cinnamon jalebi with coconut rabri and bhapa doi cheesecake comes for Rs 125 a plate.
Pastry chef Kishi Arora, who owns baking company Foodaholics, said spending power and experimentation have risen significantly and customers want to try fun Indian things that have been created by playing around with international techniques.
"Recently, a customer asked me to bake a New York style cheesecake with red chilli powder and chunda (raw mango chutney). So, I made little cupcakes out of them and the Gujarati clients were floored," said Arora. Her cakes are priced upward of Rs 3,000 per kilo and that includes crossover desserts.

With several former MPs and former ministers continuing to occupy government bungalows and flats in Lutyens’s Delhi despite reminders to vacate them, the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) has started taking drastic measures like disconnecting power and water connections to the houses. These include the houses occupied by former ministers Ajit Singh and A K Antony.
On Saturday, NDMC officials cut off power connection to the bungalow occupied by Ajit Singh. Shortly after the action at his 12, Tughlaq Road residence, the RLD chief told reporters he was not given more time which he had sought to vacate the property.
“I am not entitled to this house anymore since I am not an MP. They came on September 9 and asked me to vacate. I told them I am packing and that I will move by September 25. You should ask them why they have cut electricity,” Singh told reporters.
So far, the NDMC has taken action against at least 20 former MPs.
Sources in the NDMC said the decision was taken since ministers of the Narendra Modi government were still working out of their respective state guesthouses in the absence of official accommodation. The NDMC plans to disconnect power and water supplies to more houses in the next 24 hours, officials said.
According to the NDMC, a total of 30 bungalows need to be vacated at the earliest to accommodate new MPs and other government officials.
The list of houses to be vacated includes those occupied by Ajit Singh, former defence minister Antony and Mohd Azharuddin.
Last week, supporters of Ajit Singh had stood their ground against a team from the NDMC and Delhi Police at the Tughlaq Road residence when the latter came to take possession of the house.
Urban Development Minister M Venkaiah Naidu on Friday reviewed the allotment of bungalows to cabinet ministers still staying the state guesthouses. NDMC Chairman Jalaj Srivastava said the council is going to comply with the UD Ministry orders and vacate at least 30 government residences currently occupied by former MPs. “Power supply to more bunglows is likely to be cut,” he said. He also said that the MPs did not vacate the bungalows despite being served due notice as elections approached in May.
“An action-taken report in this regard was submitted to the Lok Sabha Housing Committee yesterday,” a senior official said.

Hyderabad, Sept 13:  
In an example of industry-laboratory collaboration, IICT and Avra Labs have joined hands to develop and commercialise a manufacturing technology to produce 'Misoprostol’, a drug useful in reducing death rates during abortion.
The Hyderabad-based, CSIR-IICT team developed the process know-how for this important prostaglandin-based drug, which the WHO declared under essential medicine to induce labour induction. The technology was later transferred to AVRA Laboratories.
The pharma company has successfully commercialised the drug. Current demand for it in the Indian market is over Rs 350 crore per annum. The drug is also used in combination with pain killers an anti-ulcer agent.
According to the laboratory spokesperson, the CSIR-IICT technology has successfully reduced the cost of production of the drug and it has become affordable to common people in the country.
The lab has also won the best Technology Award 2014 in the category of Physical Sciences among the 37 labs under the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). The award carries a cash prize of Rs two lakh. It will be received with a plaque by a IICT team from the Prime Minister at the Foundation Day function on September 26 in the national capital.
At the AVRA Labs, a team led by A V Rama Rao, also a former Director of IICT and present chief, took up the synthetic challenges for Misoprostol, and optimised the process to meet the stringent European Pharmacopia’s standards.

Bangalore, Sept 13:  
Re-opening of HAL airport in Bangalore will place the city in the league of international cities which have more than one airport, said Dr R K Tyagi, Chairman, Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd.
Speaking at a felicitation function organised by the Society of Indian Aerospace Technologies (SIATI), Tyagi said: "Apart from its previous experience, HAL has the infrastructure and capacity to achieve this goal and the re-opening of the airport will benefit the people of the region."
Indian Aeronautics Commission
He also suggested the formation of Indian Aeronautics Commission to bring various organisations and institutes currently functioning under different ministries under one umbrella for better cohesion and decision making.
Tyagi spoke on taxation issues, challenges faced by the aerospace industry in skill development and R&D, the need for civil-military integration in certain aerospace fields and the importance of having an MRO hub in India.
Earlier, Karnataka Chief Minister, Siddaramaiah, and the Union Minister of State for Civil Aviation, G M Siddeshwara, felicitated Tyagi.
Siddaramaiah hailed the contribution of HAL in laying strong foundation that ultimately turned Karnataka as the aerospace hub of India.
Siddeshwara spoke about various measures undertaken by the Central Government for the development of aviation sector.

Virbhadra rules out mid-term polls im HP  says his govtstablePrint
PTI | Hamirpur | Posted: September 13, 2014 4:16 pm | Updated: September 13, 2014 6:20 pm
Asserting that his government was firm and stable, Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh on Saturday ruled out mid term assembly polls in the state.
“My government enjoys absolute majority and would complete its five year term. BJP leaders, who are spreading canards regarding the stability of my government, would be disappointed,” he said while talking to mediapersons here.
Singh also ruled out any reshuffle in his cabinet and said all ministers were functioning well.
The ministers have been given complete freedom to work the way they want, but once the cabinet takes a decision it is binding on all the ministers, he said.
“I am not a dictator. I am concerned about the well-being and welfare of the masses but the decisions taken in the state cabinet are binding on all ministers and no one should have an impression that he is above the cabinet,” he added.
Hitting out at BJP leaders, especially former Chief Minister Prem Kumar Dhumal and his MP son Anurag Thkaur, for “unleashing a vilification campaign against him”, Singh said their nefarious designs would never succeed.
“The previous BJP governments led by Dhumal had tried to implicate me in false cases but thanks to God, I got clean chit from courts and came out unscathed,” he said.
Dismissing allegations made by BJP leaders that he was unleashing political vendetta on opponents, Singh said it was the other way round as doing such a thing was an unhealthy tradition started by the BJP.
Singh said he was enquiring into the allegations of corruption and misuse of power against some BJP leaders.
“I am trying fulfill the promises made to people during the elections to probe all cases of corruption,” he said. He also said that the Congress government was working to make Hamirpur district “an educational hub” and had already opened various educational institutes in the district.
A new medical college would also be opened soon for which land is being identified, he added.
On being asked whether the new medical college would be like AIIMS as suggested by the local MP Anurag Thakur, Singh replied in negative and said he would be happy if Thakur brought any AIIMS-like college to the state.
My government enjoys absolute majority and would complete its five year term. BJP leaders, who are spreading canards regarding the stability of my government, would be disappointed

Email Services Like Gmail May be Banned for Government Use: ReportCognizant to Buy IT Services Provider Trizetto for $2.7 Billion
New Delhi: Popular email services like Gmail and Yahoo! are likely to be banned for official use to safeguard critical and sensitive government data.
A proposal to this effect is being moved by Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DeitY) for Cabinet approval by month-end, sources said.
Government communication, barring those of Ministry of Defence and External Affairs, will be done using the platform of the National Informatics Centre (NIC), they added.
While Defence Ministry has its own separate secure email server, the External Affairs too may follow suit.
The move comes amid concerns about rising cybercrime and hacking incidents. Earlier this week, five million usernames and passwords of Google were reported to have been leaked online by Russian hackers.
Government is expected to route official communication through the National Informatics Centre's (NIC) email service.
DeitY has drafted the policy on use of email for government offices and departments and views and comments of ministries concerned are being taken on this, sources said.
Sources said the policy seeks to protect large amount of critical government data and aims to make it mandatory for government offices to communicate only on nic.in platform, not on commercial email services Gmail, Yahoo!, Hotmail, etc.
The policy is expected to cover about 5-6 lakh Central and state government employees for using the email service provided by NIC, they added.
To ensure smooth working of the NIC platform, DeitY will soon require about Rs 4-5 crore to ramp up NIC infrastructure.
Besides, a total investment of around Rs 50-100 crore would be required for full operationability of the policy, including integrating emails with cloud so that official data can be saved on a cloud platform and can then be easily shared with the concerned government ministries and departments.

India Power Coprn plans to augment renewable power procurement

Kolkata, Sept 13:  
India Power Corporation Ltd (IPCL), a power generation and distribution company, is augmenting its renewable power procurement plans. It has also planned to add 200 MW wind power capacity by the end of 2015.
IPCL aimed to make mandatory renewable and cogeneration purchase obligation (RPO) an in-built process, said Hemant Kanoria, Chairman, at the company’s 94th annual general meeting on Saturday.
In 2013-14, IPCL procured 0.727 million units of solar power from Seebpore unit of West Bengal Green Energy Corporation or about 0.07 per cent of the total power requirement of the company in its distribution command area.
Higher solar power procurement rate notwithstanding (around Rs 5 a unit), this small component did not impact the company’s tariffs in the command area.
Wind power generation
Addressing shareholders, he said the company’s wind power generation capacity of 95.2 MW in Rajasthan, Gujarat and Karnataka recorded a growth in gross revenue from Rs 49.21 crore in 2012-13 to Rs 64.77 crore in 2013-14, a near 32 per cent rise.
"We are quite hopeful of improving further the performance of this vertical,” he said.
IPCL is a supplier to several business units such as the collieries of Eastern Coalfields Ltd as well as hospitals, government utilities and industrial and commercial consumers from its thermal power plant at Dishergarh in West Bengal. The company’s solar power plant is located in Asansol.
Thermal power projects
It is currently setting up a thermal power plant at Haldia in West Bengal. It has also planned thermal power projects in Bihar, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. IPCL intends to scale its generation portfolio to 10,000 MW in the coming years.
The company, through a wholly owned subsidiary, has started distribution franchisee operations at Gaya in Bihar.

Remove obstacles for Make in India to happen: global auto cosroad transport
Global auto majors, including General Motors and Honda, on Friday said the government should remove “obstacles” and make policies more business friendly if India has to successfully achieve Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Make In India’ goal.
They highlighted issues, ranging from difficulty in getting business permits to taxation, infrastructure and logistics, which they said are acting as “obstacles” in the growth of the auto industry in India.
“There are a considerable number of obstacles to doing business in this country. It is hoped that such obstacles will be cleared away under the new leadership of Prime Minister Modi,” Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) Chairman Fumihiko Ike said while addressing the annual convention of SIAM.
Mr. Ike, who is also the chairman of Honda Motor Co., further said: “Many Japanese auto parts suppliers are anxious to establish operations in this country. However, those suppliers as well as auto manufacturers often encounter problems in obtaining business permits and completing paperwork required for acquisition of the business property. The complicated process of obtaining a plant construction permit, in some cases, has seriously hindered business plans. These problems are further compounded by India’s complex domestic taxation system which varies from one state to other. These taxes, which are far more burdensome than international taxations standards, are also impending investments in India,” he added.
Asking for speedy measures to address such issues, Mr. Ike said: “JAMA therefore would like to see the earliest possible introduction of single, uniform national GST and our industry continues to call for improvements in the permanent establishment tax and other surcharge taxes. The investment environment in India for Japanese companies should greatly improve once these complicated taxation problems are resolved.”
Sharing similar sentiments, Nissan Motor Co. senior vice president and chairman for Africa, Middle East and India Takashi Hata said: “Simplify the vendor duty drawback scheme. This (India) is not the easiest country to get this.”
Expressing similar views, General Motors executive vice-president Stefan Jacoby said: “To realise the full potential of the industry, we encourage the government to reform overall central and state taxation policies in a timely manner.”
Mr. Jacoby, who along with GM CEO Mary Barra met Mr. Modi on Thursday, said the PM and his team “are creating an environment that is friendly to business and investment” but added, “policies that are both rational and transparent — such as a GST — will go a long way towards encouraging companies to invest locally for the long term.”
“We would like to see taxation standards that are common across federal states. We need to make vehicles more affordable,” Mr. Jacoby said.
Calling for a long-term perspective from the government, Mr. Jacoby said: “The current product life cycle is approximately 10 years. The auto industry requires stable industry policy and regulations to optimise our investment. We need a clear road map from the government for regulations with respect to safety, emissions and CO2.”
Drawing attention to labour reforms, Mr. Jacoby said: “We would also like the government to address the need for flexible labour reforms, especially in manufacturing. This is one of the areas in which India lags behind other industrialised economies.”
Mr. Jacoby further said: “We strongly encourage the Indian government to explore additional trade opportunities by bringing down tariffs and eliminating non-tariff barriers and support exports of vehicles and components.”

Honda initiates process to acquire land for Gujarat plantHonda Cars initiates land acqusition process for new plant in Gujarat

Honda Cars India has initiated the process to acquire land in Gujarat to come up with its third manufacturing plant in the country.
The auto company , which currently has two manufacturing plants at Greater Noida and Tapukara, is also looking to start a second shift at the Tapukara facility.
"First step for us is to start the second shift at Tapukara which we have started planning and we shall be up and running with the second shift by November," Honda Cars India Ltd (HCIL) Senior Vice President ( Marketing and Sales ) Jnaneswar Sen told reporters on the sidelines of the annual SIAM convention.
"In addition to that, we have just started the process to acquire land in Gujarat for the long term purposes given our commitment to the Indian market," he added.
He, however, declined to provide further details.
A subsidiary of Japan's Honda, the company's current installed manufacturing capacity stands at 2.4 lakh units across its two manufacturing plants.
The Tapukara plant, which rolls out sedans Amaze and City, currently has a production capacity of 60,000 units on a single shift basis.
"The Tapukara plant is spread over 450 acres while the Greater Noida plant has an area of 150 acres, so we have a lot of scope to expand in Tapukara," Sen said.
The addition in production capacity at the Tapukara plant would help the company reduce waiting periods on cars City and Amaze, he added.
While City has a waiting period of up to 3 months depending upon the variant, Amaze also has a waiting period of 2-3 weeks.
Asked about the new product launches , Sen said, "We are keen on new generation Accord and intend to launch it here in the next financial year".
The company also intends to launch new Jazz in 2015, he added.
Commenting on the upcoming festival season, Sen said the company expected the period to be better than the last year.

flood
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday made an appeal to all Indians to donate generously to the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund (PMNRF) for the flood-affected people in Jammu and Kashmir.
In his appeal, Mr. Modi said, “My Fellow Citizens, you are all aware that unprecedented floods have caused havoc in the State of Jammu and Kashmir. A large number of persons have died or have been temporarily displaced.
“Property and infrastructure worth crores of rupees have been damaged. Our fellow countrymen in Jammu and Kashmir need our help at this critical hour to tide over the calamity and to rebuild their lives.”
The Prime Minister said the Centre was extending full cooperation to the State government in the measures for rescue, relief and rehabilitation, besides direct assistance to the affected people.
“I request all fellow countrymen to stand shoulder to shoulder with our distressed brothers and sisters in Jammu and Kashmir and be part of the national effort to support them in this hour of crisis. I appeal to all citizens to donate generously to the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund (PMNRF),” Mr. Modi added.
Asking the people to be part of the national effort, a PMO statement also gave details of various modes for payment to the Fund including online contributions through the PMO website.
Payment may be made by cheque/draft/cash in the name of “Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund” and sent to the PMO in South Block, the statement said, adding as per directions on the subject, the nationalised banks will not charge any commission on preparation of drafts favouring the PMNRF.
Mr. Modi’s appeal came a day after all officers and staff in his office voluntarily contributed their one day’s salary to the Fund for the flood-affected people.
In the worst-ever floods to hit the state in 109 years, over 250 people have lost their lives while more than 1.25 lakh people have been evacuated from the affected areas by the armed forces. Authorities fear that the number of dead could be higher.

Mark your calendar: Trio of market movers next weekInvestors beware: Fed, Scotland vote, Alibaba IPO could roil market

This is a big week on Wall Street. In a span of three days, investors will hear from the Fed, find out if Scotland opts to cut its ties with England and learn if the Alibaba IPO lives up to the mega-hype.
“It is of note that these date-certain events are clustered,” notes Woody Dorsey, who heads Market Semiotics, an investment research firm that specializes in behavioral finance and investor psychology.
Each event on its own has market implications. But clustered together in a three-day span that kicks off Wednesday, means the jumble of headlines could pack an even bigger market punch — perhaps dragging stock prices lower, Dorsey warns.
“Volatility and turbulence should pick up,” Dorsey tells USA TODAY. “It looks like (the risk is to the) downside. At the moment the reason is: “uncertainty” about the outcome of each news event.
In a sign of angst, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index last week finished lower, snapping a five-week winning streak. It kicks off the week 1.1% below its Sept. 5 record closing high of 2007.71. In early trading Monday, the benchmark U.S. stock index is down less than 3 points at 1983.
Here’s the key dates and news events to watch.
Day 1: WEDNESDAY, SEPT. 17

The news event: The two-day Federal Reserve policy meeting ends Wednesday with a policy statement and press conference with Fed Chair Janet Yellen.
The fear: The central bank changes its tune on the timing of interest rate hikes, and tips Wall Street off to the fact that the first rate hike — which the market expects in mid-2015 — will come sooner. Low rates have been a major driver of rising stock prices in the bull market.
The risk: Stock investors are not positioned properly for an earlier rate increase and react negatively, pricing in slower growth and skimpier corporate profits going forward, causing stock prices to turn lower.
 
 Day 2: THURSDAY, SEPT. 18
Will Scotland vote “yes” or “no” for independence? (Andy Buchanan, AFP/Getty Images)
The news event: Scotland’s referendum vote seeking independence from England.
The fear: This once low-probability event can’t be ruled out, polls say. Scottish independence would mark a major “change” in the political and economic ties in the United Kingdom.
The risk: A surprise “yes” vote would add a fresh jolt of geopolitical uncertainty and could spook currency markets, as well as other markets, including London’s stock market. “It would be a change and hurts the euro,” says Dorsey.
 
 Day 3: FRIDAY, SEPT. 19

The news event: The hotly anticipated initial public offering of Chinese Internet giant Alibaba — expected to be the biggest U.S. IPO ever — is tentatively set to start trading Friday. The price range of $60 to $66 per share is expected to be raised higher amid strong demand.
The fear: The IPO doesn’t live up to the hype and the shares underperform on Day 1 of trading. On the flip side, if the IPO does match or exceed the hype, and the shares trade sharply higher, it could be the latest sign that investor optimism is nearing the stage of irrational exuberance.
The risk: Market sentiment sours on the view that a successful Alibaba IPO marks a stock market top or a poor outcome signals that investors are no longer willing to buy “story” stocks.
“Big IPOs can mark tops,” Dorsey says. “Tech is the market leader so far this year, so if that reverses, it would be a big signal.”
 

US general Allen to head anti-jihadist coalitionRetired US general John Allen. ( Source: AP )
PTI | Washington | Posted: September 13, 2014 9:07 am
Retired US general John Allen, the cerebral ex-commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan who also led troops in western Iraq, has been named to lead the international effort against Islamic State extremists, officials have announced.
The job will require a difficult balancing act that will be familiar ground to the retired four-star Marine officer, who has plenty of experience managing unwieldy coalitions and navigating the volatile politics of the Middle East.
Allen, 60, has been an unabashed hawk when it comes to Islamic State, urging a no holds-barred assault on the militants, who have employed brutal tactics in their advance across Syria and Iraq. “The Islamic State is an entity beyond the pale of humanity and it must be eradicated. If we delay now, we will pay later,” Allen wrote in Defense One last month.
As head of the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan from July 2011 to December 2013, Allen had to deal with the notoriously mercurial president Hamid Karzai — as well as commanders from dozens of countries while overseeing the start of a troop drawdown. And before that, as the number two at US Central Command, which oversees American forces in the Middle East, Allen devoted much of his time to tracking America’s arch-foe Iran.
“In this role General Allen will help continue to build, coordinate and sustain a global coalition across the multiple lines of efforts to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL,” said State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf, referring to the jihadists that have seized territory in Iraq and Syria.
President Barack Obama, in announcing a strategy to destroy the group, said the creation of an international coalition that included Arab and Muslim states was vital to the anti-IS effort. Allen’s deputy will be Brett McGurk, the deputy assistant secretary of state for Iraq and Iran.
The former commander will not oversee military operations, which is the job of the current chief of Central Command, General Lloyd Austin. But Allen likely will be asking members of an international coalition to contribute aircraft, ammunition, access to bases or other aid to the fight.
Allen is no stranger to the sectarian politics of Iraq, where he made his name from 2006-2008 in western Anbar province, forging alliances with Sunni tribes who turned on Al-Qaeda militants.
The approach to the Sunni tribal leaders was controversial at the time, and some fellow officers opposed the effort but it proved successful, producing the so-called “Anbar Awakening”.
The Islamic State is an entity beyond the pale of humanity and it must be eradicated.

Excessive lust leads to divorce: Shiv Sena on seat sharing talks#maharashtra #maharashtra assembly elections 2014 #maharashtra elections #shiv sena #bjp #ncp #congress
Mumbai: Citing a recent court verdict, Shiv Sena on Saturday said, "excessive lust leads to divorce" and asked the constituents of 'Mahayuti' alliance to exercise restraint while demanding extra share during seat allocation talks.
"Allies in the coalition must dream of a victory. For this, all parties must give up the lust for more seats. To say we will stay in the coalition only if we get 'so many seats' is not right," an editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana said.
The remarks, coming ahead of the finalisation of seat sharing talks for the October 15 Maharashtra polls, are being considered a veiled criticism of BJP amid reports that the latter had sought more seats to contest this time around.
After winning 23 of the state's 48 seats in Lok Sabha polls, BJP has stepped up demand to contest more seats in Assembly polls.
"We all want a change of regime. Even if someone has got fewer seats to contest, then too, they will get a proper share in government. But for that, one needs to come to power first," Sena said.
After winning 23 of the state's 48 seats in Lok Sabha polls, BJP has stepped up demand to contest more seats in Assembly polls. The Sena had won 18 LS seats. The Congress-NCP alliance, which has governed Maharashtra since 1999, won only six seats.

Brisk voting in 3 Lok Sabha  33 assembly seats; will Narendra Modi magic work for BJPComments
Brisk voting was recorded in most of the 33 assembly seats and 3 Lok Sabha seats where bypolls were held on Saturday.
In Uttar Pradesh voting percentage was highest  in Mainpuri Lok Sabha constituency, which was vacated by Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh. Mulayam's grandnephew Tej Pratap Singh Yadav, 27, is contesting the seat on an SP ticket.
Among the voters was chief minister Akhilesh Yadav who landed in Saifai to cast his ballot.
Lack of enthusiasm was witnessed among the voters in the first two hours in all the constituencies, but slowly picked up later. By 3 pm around 44 % had cast their votes. Mild rains also affected the voter turnout.
The Mainpuri seat was held by SP, while all the eleven Assembly seats where voting is on were held by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
In West Bengal voting was brisk in Basirhat Dakshin while Chowringhee had lower voter turnout. Both the Left and the BJP accused the ruling TMC of terrorising voters, BJP's Basirhat candidate Samik Bhatatcharya said.
Over 62% polling was recorded in Basirhat Dakshin while nearly 40% voters exercised their franchise in Chowringhee  till 2 pm.
Voting was also brisk and peaceful in Telangana, Rajasthan and other states where bypolls are held.
Analysts are looking to see which way the wind blows in the bypolls spread across these nine states.
The results of two Lok Sabha seats — Vadodara which was vacated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Medak in Telangana was vacated by Telangana Rashtra Samithi chief and chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao — are unlikely to throw any surprises. But Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav’s prestige is at stake in his home turf Mainpuri, the third Lok Sabha seat.
The bypolls are being seen as an indicator of the popularity of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and opposition parties ahead of four assembly elections to be held this year.
They also pose a key question on the future of the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in Uttar Pradesh.
The BJP swept to power on the back of a so-called Modi wave this summer, but failed to maintain the momentum in last month’s by-elections in four states where it lost a majority of seats to the Congress party and its allies.
The BJP and its allies together won only eight of the 18 seats that went to the polls while the Congress and its allies won 10.
In the last Lok Sabha polls, a large number of OBCs and Dalits rallied behind the BJP across the Hindi belt. The shift dented the SP and BSP’s support base in the largest electoral state. The SP won just seven seats while Mayawati’s BSP drew a blank.
The grand alliance of the RJD-JDU-Congress could halt the BJP’s charge into this caste base. In the absence of such an alliance in Uttar Pradesh, any further losses may lead to an existential crisis for the two caste-based parties.
If the opposition parties — especially the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress in Rajasthan, Gujarat and Assam — can stop the BJP’s march, their claim about the Modi wave waning will receive a further boost.
With elections in Maharashtra and Haryana due next month, any by-election victory will also give the beleaguered Congress a fresh face saver after its humiliating Lok Sabha defeat.
But it may not be so easy for the opposition. Of the 33 seats, 11 are in Uttar Pradesh where the BJP swept 71 of 80 Lok Sabha seats.
In Gujarat and Rajasthan, where 13 assembly seats are up for grabs, the opposition could not even open its account in the general election.
Three seats are heading for the polls in Congress-ruled Assam where the BJP bagged 50% of Lok Sabha constituencies.
In West Bengal, the ruling Trinamool Congress will be desperate to win both seats as it wants to show that the Saradha scam has not hurt the party’s prospects.
For the BJP, a win or even a number two position in the results from Assam and Bengal will further cement its position as a fast emerging force, replacing traditional opposition parties like AGP and Left, respectively.
The by-elections in Chhattisgarh, Sikkim, Andhra and Tripura will test if the ruling parties can further consolidate their positions. Tripura is the only state where the Left is in power.

How US govt s push for data set stage for su...How US government's push for data from Yahoo set stage for surveillance on internet users

Government's authority to demand data from tech companies remain under the scanner even a year after major government surveillance of internet users came to light.
ET SPECIAL:
ET Special: All you want to know about Apple iPhone 6
SAN FRANCISCO - It's hard to fathom after a year of revelations about widespread government surveillance of Internet users, but in 2007, the government's authority to demand such data from technology companies without a search warrant was very much in doubt.
That changed a year later, when crucial precedents establishing the government's right to request emails, phone records and other user data were set in a secret court case in which Yahoo unsuccessfully challenged the constitutionality of the government's demands for information about its foreign users.
Documents from that case, which were released by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court this week after much of the file was declassified, paint a vivid portrait of a battle that pitted a leading Internet company against some of the top officials in the Bush administration over what was legitimate gathering of foreign intelligence and what was illegal snooping.
At one point, when Yahoo refused to turn over the requested data while it appealed its loss at the first stage of the case, the director of national intelligence, Michael McConnell, submitted an impassioned 16-page affidavit to Reggie B. Walton of U.S. District Court, the surveillance court judge who had decided the case, outlining the various threats posed by al-Qaida and other terrorist groups and the need for Yahoo's cooperation.
International terrorists "use Yahoo to communicate over the Internet," McConnell wrote. "Any further delay in Yahoo's compliance could cause great harm to the United States, as vital foreign intelligence information contained in communications to which only Yahoo has access, will go uncollected."
Underscoring that urgency, the government's lawyers asked Walton to declare Yahoo in contempt and impose a fine of $250,000 a day, with the daily fine to double each week that the company continued to drag its feet. The judge took just a few hours to order Yahoo to comply "forthwith" or face "coercive" fines, prompting it to cooperate as it pursued its appeal.
The legal decisions in the case, and the reasoning used by both sides, helped set the stage for an updated Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that set clearer rules about what types of information the government could seek from technology companies like Yahoo, Google and Facebook, which hold vast quantities of private user information.
The lower court and appellate rulings supporting the government also gave encouragement to national security officials as they pushed forward with broad surveillance programs like Prism, XKeyscore and others described in documents leaked last year by Edward J. Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor.

Stone pelters attack IAF relief aircraft  rescue operations continueStone pelters attack IAF relief aircraft, rescue ops continue

Some of the 80 IAF aircraft involved in relief and rescue operations across the flooded Srinagar city have suffered minor damage after they were targeted by stone pelters but the security personnel say they "won't give up" till help reaches all.

"There have been incidents when the helicopters flying at low altitude were targeted with stones and one of the helicopter was in fact hit by several stones causing some minor damage on the body and near the rotary wings," a senior air force officer told PTI.
The officer said that the helicopter, however, returned safely to the base where the damage was being assessed. The army too says that some of its boats deployed for relief and rescue operations were attacked by stone pelters.
"It is unfortunate that the people who are trying to save them are being attacked, but we will not give up and will continue with our work till help does not reach to every single soul," said air marshal SB Deo, director general of air operations.
There have been reports that at certain places people are being instigated by separatists to target and disrupt the relief and rescue work being undertaken by the air force and the army.

Deo said that he could understand that there was anger amongst the people and he has empathy for those who lost everything in the floods.
Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah too has condemned the targeting of the army and air force personnel who are engaged in the relief and rescue operations across the Valley and appealed to the "disruptive elements" to allow these operations.
"These disruptive elements are fishing in the troubled waters, they must not become impediments in the relief and rescue work being carried out by different agencies. "They will get plenty of time afterwards," Abdullah said.

Meanwhile, 1,42,000 people have been rescued from the flood-ravaged parts of Jammu and Kashmir so far as rescue operations enter their 12th day.
"Armed Forces and NDRF have so far rescued over 1,42,000 persons from different parts of J&K in the ongoing rescue and relief operations," a defence spokesperson said in Srinagar.
Rest of India pitches in
Thirteen tonnes of water purifying tablets and six water filtration plants with a capacity to filter 1.2 lakh bottles per day has already reached Srinagar, he said.
Suction pumps and other engineering equipment from Vishakhapatnam have also reached the flood affected area for relief work, he said, adding twelve sewage pumps from Delhi have also been dispatched to the Valley.
The spokesman said communication equipment of department of telecommunication, army, BSNL and some private companies have also been dispatched to restore the network.
Also, thirty generator sets of 3 to 5 KVA capacity have been sent to Srinagar to provide continuous power supply in relief camps and field hospitals, he added.
Besides these, as many as 8,200 blankets and 1,119 tents have been provided to the flood victims, he said, adding, 80 medical teams of the Armed Forces Medical Services are already operating in full swing.
Four field hospitals have been established in Avantipur, Pattan, Anantnag and Old Airfield where medical aid is being provided to the ailing people, he said, adding that till now, they have treated more than 22,500 patients.
Union home secretary Anil Goswami, who is monitoring the rescue and relief operations met CM Abdullah on Saturday.
 
Goswami, who is camping in Srinagar for the past two days, had earlier held a series of meetings with the officials of Indian Army, Indian Air force, state administration and other agencies engaged in the relief and rescue works.

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said on Saturday he had ordered government forces to halt shelling of residential areas controlled by the Islamic State extremist group to protect civilians.
“Two days ago, I gave my orders to stop bombardment of all towns inhabited by civilians even if they have Daesh,” Mr. al-Abadi said, using an Arabic acronym for the Sunni group.
“We don’t want to see more innocent victims,” he told a conference in Baghdad, according to Alsumaria News.
His remarks came after reports that many civilians have been killed and wounded in government attacks on areas held by Islamic State.

ICICI Bank raises Rs 3 000 crore from overseas marketsICICI Bank eyes expansion, raises Rs 3,000 crore from overseas markets

ICICI Bank has raised around Rs 3,000 crore (US $500 million) from overseas markets by selling its bonds to fund foreign expansion plans.
The bank, acting through its Dubai branch, floated 5.5 year fixed rate notes under Rule 144A/Reg S format, ICICI Bank said in a statement.
The 144A/Reg S status allows the bond to be sold to qualified institutional buyers in the United States without the need to register the issue with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
"The notes carry a coupon of 3.50 per cent and were offered at an issue price of 99.653," it said.
In 2013, the private sector lender had raised US $750 million in a 5.5-year overseas bond sale at a coupon of 4.80 per cent.

Will Modi wave continue for Maharashtra pollsUpdated: September 13, 2014 09:45 IST
Will Modi wave continue for Maharashtra polls?

The odds are certainly stacked against ruling Congress-NCP
The Modi wave in the Lok Sabha polls had reduced the Congress party to the worst performance in its history in the crucial state of Maharashtra. As the State heads for the Assembly polls, the question is whether there will be a sequel to the saffron surge in this 288-seat state.
The Lok Sabha polls had seen the Congress reduced to just two seats and its ally the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) managing only four. By contrast the Shiv Sena-BJP and their allies won 42 of the 48 Lok Sabha seats.
The odds are certainly stacked against the Congress-NCP. Besides the Modi factor, the alliance is shackled by major anti-incumbency after 15 consecutive years in power. Besides, the Congress-NCP alliance faces grave corruption charges which the Opposition has made a campaign issue accusing the parties of “scams worth Rs. 11.88 lakh crore.” The Adarsh scam had cost former Chief Minister Ashok Chavan his post while the multicrore irrigation scam tainted Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar and State NCP President Sunil Tatkare.
The Shiv Sena-BJP and four smaller parties which form the Mahayuti face the challenge of capitalising on these weaknesses. Besides, there are some concerns about the extent to which the Modi magic will continue. The recent by-polls in several States saw the Congress make unexpected gains. ‘How many of the Modi government’s promises have been fulfilled? The price rise has not been curtailed,” says Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan.
The BJP will have to overcome the absence of mass leader Gopinath Munde in the campaign. However, it has in its arsenal, Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a campaigner and Mr. Shah’s strategising which saw the BJP sweep Uttar Pradesh in the Lok Sabha polls.
Corruption, price rise
Besides corruption and price rise, the development plank will also remain an election issue. Mr. Modi and Mr. Chavan have made it a point to inaugurate a slew of key projects in the State. The Congress and NCP have raised the issue of the demand for statehood for Vidarbha to target the saffron parties for their divergent stands on the issue. The ongoing farm crisis exacerbated by the delayed monsoon could also impact the poll results.
Both fronts have had to deal with a battle for one-upmanship which has caused concerns about the smooth running of the alliances. The NCP and the BJP have demanded half the assembly seats from their allies.
This election is also a crucial test for Raj Thackeray’s Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS). The party was a game-changer in the 2009 elections, cutting dramatically into saffron votes, but it drew a blank in the Lok Sabha elections. Since then Mr. Thackeray first announced he would contest the Lok Sabha polls but later said he was undecided. With the party showing no signs of a concrete plan yet, it faces a battle for its very survival this election.

ET Special: All you want to know about Apple iPhone 6
Apple CEO Tim Cook began working for the company in 1998. He was recruited by Steve Jobs from Compaq, where he was perfectly content. But Apple was persistent about Cook coming in for an interview, so Cook caved. Cook tells Charlie Rose how he wound up at Apple. During his one-on-one meeting with Jobs, Cook learned about the company's desire to enter the consumer space. Jobs also described a wonder computer Apple was working on but hadn't yet released, the iMac. The iMac was the first hit product Jobs launched when he returned as Apple's CEO in 1997. It's been credited for helping turn around the entire company after Apple nearly went bankrupt in the 90s.
Cook also felt like he and Jobs would work well together, so he followed his gut and went to work for Apple.
"All of a sudden I thought, 'I'm doing it. I'm going for it,'" Cook tells Rose. "And you have this voice in your ear that says, 'Go west young man, go west.'"
How Jobs convinced him to join Apple in a recent interview:
Charlie Rose: I mentioned at the beginning interview, the fact, when you made a decision in 1998 about Apple. You had some reservations. But at the same time, during your interview with Steve, you said, something like this, I was prepared within five minutes to throw caution to the wind. What did he say that made you believe this company is the place for Tim Cook?
Tim Cook: It was an interesting meeting. I had gotten a call several times from the search people that he had employed. And I said no, I was at Compaq, I was happy and, or thought I was. And they were persistent. And so I finally thought, I'm going to go out and take the meeting. Steve created the whole industry that I'm in, I'd love to meet him. And so I'm honestly going into the meeting.
CR: There's no downside of this.
TC: Well I'm just thinking I'm going to meet him and all of a sudden he's talking about his strategy and his vision, and what he was doing was going 100 percent into consumer. When everybody else in the industry had decided you couldn't make any money on consumers so they were headed to services and storage and enterprise. And I thought, I'd always thought that following the herd was not a good thing, that it was a terrible thing to do right? You're either going to lose big, or lose, but those are the two options. He was doing something totally different.
And he told me a little about the design, enough to get me really interested. And he was describing what later would be called the iMac. And the way that he talked, and the way the chemistry was in the room, it was just he and I. And I could tell, I can work with him.
And I looked at the problems Apple had, and I thought you know, I can make a contribution here. And working with him, and this is a privilege of a lifetime. And so all of a sudden I thought, I 'm doing it. I'm going for it. And you have this voice in your ear that says go west young man, go west. I was young at the time. But you know, you come back and you try to do the things that people do with spreadsheets and stuff, and none of it makes sense. It didn't make sense. And yet, my gut said, go for it. And I listened to my gut. There was literally no one around me that was inviting doing it.

Russia and China discussing 32 joint projects: Russian deputy PM Igor Shuvalov
Reuters Sep 13, 2014, 03.11PM IST
(Faced with Western sanctions,…)
MOSCOW: Russia and China are discussing more than 30 joint economic projects in a variety of areas from petrochemicals to banking, Russia's First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov said on Saturday after visiting China last week.
As Russia was hit by new sanctions by the United States and the European Union on Friday over its involvement in Ukraine, Shuvalov said Asian countries such as China did not support the Western sanctions and were keen to cooperate with Russia.
"Yesterday in China we discussed 32 projects. And they cover absolutely everything: petrochemicals, the banking sector, work in the area of food products, and very, very varied projects," Shuvalov said during an appearance on "Vesti on Saturday with Sergey Brilov", a TV discussion programme.
"It isn't just gold, oil, gas and copper that we discussed yesterday," Shuvalov said. "And in general many people in Russia are under the impression that China is only interested in natural resources."
Shuvalov visited China and Singapore last week to meet investors and government officials.
Faced with Western sanctions, which are damaging Russia's economy, Moscow has been playing up opportunities for economic cooperation with Asia.
"China announces every time at the beginning of any meeting that they categorically do not accept any sanctions, which they consider illegal," he said.
He also said Russia was studying China's own experience of sanctions imposed against it after the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, arguing that China surmounted them with the help of liberalising economic reforms which Russia should copy.
"If one looks at the experience of '89 after the events on Tiananmen Square we, of course, have noticed what happened and how it happened. Therefore this thesis about greater economic freedom is in part (based on) the experience of the People's Republic of China," he said.

Virbhadra rules out mid-term polls im HP  says his govt stablePrint
PTI | Hamirpur | Posted: September 13, 2014 4:16 pm | Updated: September 13, 2014 6:20 pm
Asserting that his government was firm and stable, Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh on Saturday ruled out mid term assembly polls in the state.
“My government enjoys absolute majority and would complete its five year term. BJP leaders, who are spreading canards regarding the stability of my government, would be disappointed,” he said while talking to mediapersons here.
Singh also ruled out any reshuffle in his cabinet and said all ministers were functioning well.
The ministers have been given complete freedom to work the way they want, but once the cabinet takes a decision it is binding on all the ministers, he said.
“I am not a dictator. I am concerned about the well-being and welfare of the masses but the decisions taken in the state cabinet are binding on all ministers and no one should have an impression that he is above the cabinet,” he added.
Hitting out at BJP leaders, especially former Chief Minister Prem Kumar Dhumal and his MP son Anurag Thkaur, for “unleashing a vilification campaign against him”, Singh said their nefarious designs would never succeed.
“The previous BJP governments led by Dhumal had tried to implicate me in false cases but thanks to God, I got clean chit from courts and came out unscathed,” he said.
Dismissing allegations made by BJP leaders that he was unleashing political vendetta on opponents, Singh said it was the other way round as doing such a thing was an unhealthy tradition started by the BJP.
Singh said he was enquiring into the allegations of corruption and misuse of power against some BJP leaders.
“I am trying fulfill the promises made to people during the elections to probe all cases of corruption,” he said. He also said that the Congress government was working to make Hamirpur district “an educational hub” and had already opened various educational institutes in the district.
A new medical college would also be opened soon for which land is being identified, he added.
On being asked whether the new medical college would be like AIIMS as suggested by the local MP Anurag Thakur, Singh replied in negative and said he would be happy if Thakur brought any AIIMS-like college to the state.
My government enjoys absolute majority and would complete its five year term. BJP leaders, who are spreading canards regarding the stability of my government, would be disappointed

Maharashtra: Congress  NCP discuss prospects of pre and post polltie-upChavan, said that the atmosphere of cynicism prevailing at the time of his anointment as chief minister has now improved. Source: Express photo
PTI | Mumbai | Posted: September 13, 2014 4:35 pm
With the seat-sharing talks between coalition partners Congress and NCP remaining stuck ahead of October 15 Assembly elections, Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan on Saturday said that parleys are on to decide whether a pre-poll or a post-poll alliance is suited for the ruling partners.
“The forthcoming Assembly elections will be the sixth election which Congress and NCP will fight. Discussions are on whether a post-poll or a pre-poll alliance is favourable for both Congress and NCP,” Chavan said at a function organised by a news channel here.
The NCP and Congress had fought the first election after the formation of the NCP (in 1999), as rivals, before coming together to form a post-poll alliance. After that, however, they have been pre-poll allies and have fought all elections from 2004 together.
To a question on who will be the next chief minister, Chavan evaded a direct reply, saying, “He will be the one who has social acceptability.”
Chavan, a senior Congress leader and former Union minister, said that though the campaign for recently-concluded Lok Sabha elections was run in the US Presidential style, “it remains to be seen whether the same is applicable in the Assembly elections.”
To a query on Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray’s chief ministerial ambitions, Chavan said that the Sena president has no experience in governance. “Uddhav was not part of the previous Sena-BJP government (in 1995),” he said.
On Congress’ strategy to take on the saffron alliance, Chavan said that “poor performance” of the Sena-BJP in the municipal corporations of Mumbai and Nagpur will be highlighted.
When asked whether the decision of the Democratic Front (DF) government to provide reservations to Maratha and Muslims communities in government jobs and educational institutions was motivated by vote bank politics, Chavan replied in negative.
On queries regarding the leadership of Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi, Chavan said, “He (Rahul) is trying to reinvent the party and bring in new leadership.”
When asked to list challenges the state is facing, Chavan said the main challenge is to bring uniform development. “Priority is Mumbai as well as rural development,” he added.
Chavan, often criticised from within Congress and ally NCP, besides the opposition over his “leadership abilities”, said that the atmosphere of cynicism prevailing at the time of his anointment as chief minister has now improved.
“Since the time I took over as chief minister I had focused on improvement of policy framework,” he added.
The forthcoming Assembly elections will be the sixth election which Congress and NCP will fight. Discussions are on whether a post-poll or a pre-poll alliance is favourable for both Congress and NCP

Stating that the density of population in the state was lowest in the country with just 17 persons per sq km, Pema appealed to the union minister not to deprive the state from the scheme merely on the ground of low population, a press release said here.
The union minister took note of the matter raised by Pema and assured him to take it up with the Prime Minister at the earliest, the release said.
The conference was convened by the Union Urban Development Ministry to discuss in detail the draft concept note of establishment of 100 smart cities in the country.

BCCI constitution amended for Jaitley: ManoharArun Jaitley
(In 2012, BCCI Constitution…)
NEW DELHI: Former BCCI president Shashank Manohar today said that the amendment of the BCCI constitution in 2012 regarding president's post was done to ensure that BJP heavyweight Arun Jaitley became board chief in 2014 instead of N Srinivasan going for a second term.
In 2012, BCCI Constitution was amended wherein an incumbent from a different zone can become president if his name is proposed and seconded by the zone which has the turn to elect the chief.
"I believe that the members decided in favour of amendment of the constitution so that decks are cleared for Mr Arun Jaitley (erstwhile DDCA president and BCCI vice-president) to become the BCCI president from East Zone. It was specifically done for Mr Jaitley as he was the unanimous choice of the members," Manohar told in an interview today.
The Nagpur-based lawyer, one of the most respected voices in BCCI during his time, made it clear that he has no intentions of taking up any post in the world's richest cricket body.
"Let me make it very clear. I am not contesting any elections nor will I ever make a comeback in any capacity in BCCI during my lifetime. I was the BCCI president and I have played my innings. I would like to keep it like that. I have no intentions of making a comeback. Yes, if my help is required, I am ready to offer my expertise," Manohar gave a straightforward reply.
Asked if there are suitable people to become BCCI president, Manohar answered,"There are plenty of people who are capable enough. I would have loved to see Mr Jaitley take over. I will not be able to comment, if he is in a position to take up the job. Mr Sharad Pawar and Mr Jagmohan Dalmiya have also been BCCI presidents earlier and are capable to handle the top job."

Dont follow straightjacket approach on inflation : RBI directorcentral bank
Reflecting on differences within the Reserve Bank, noted economist and RBI’s independent director Indira Rajaraman, on Thursday, said the central bank should not follow a straightjacket approach of controlling inflation.
“I think the RBI made things harder for itself by this straightjacket approach of committing themselves to inflation targeting when the whole world has abandoned this and has adopted financial stability as the objective of monetary policy,” Ms. Rajaraman said at an event.
RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan, who has been under fire for keeping the interest rates high for long, is targeting to keep CPI inflation at 8 per cent in January, 2015, and reduce it further to 6 per cent by 2016.

India to Have 4 More Strategic Oil Reserves: Petroleum MinisterUS-Based Gilead Licenses Hepatitis C Drug to Cipla, Ranbaxy, 5 Others
Bhubaneswar: The Centre has chalked out plans to set up at least four more strategic oil reserves in the country in a bid to store adequate stock for meeting 90-100 day requirements during any crisis.
"It is planned to reserve crude oil for 90-100 days to meet the requirement during emergency situations and crisis. The present storage capacity is 70-75 days and the four proposed projects will raise it further," Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan told reporters in Bhubaneswar.
At present, there are three strategic reserves - one in Andhra Pradesh and two in Karnataka - while four more such facilities were proposed to be set up at Bikaner in Rajasthan, Rajkot in Gujarat, Padur in Karnataka and Chandikhole in Jajpur district of Odisha, the minister said.
The new reserves would have a combined capacity of around 12.5 million metric tonnes, the oil minister said, adding that the largest petro reserve was proposed to be set up in Chandikhole, Odisha with an investment of Rs 3,800 crore.
The strategic oil reserves would enable the country to meet the requirement during any crisis as India depends heavily on crude imports, he said.
Mr Pradhan, who met Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik during the day, said he has asked Odisha government to provide 400 acres of land to set up the country's largest strategic reserve for storing 3.7 million metric tonne (MMT) crude oil at Chandikhol.
The project envisages storing eight days' requirement of crude oil in the country.
Union Petroleum Ministry has already set up a special purpose vehicle (SPV) named Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Ltd for setting up such reserves across the country.

HMT Watches may stop ticking soonBS Reporter |  Bangalore Sep 13, 2014

HMT Watches may stop ticking soon
CMD says unaware but Centre appears to have decided to close the once-iconic firm, now down to 1,105 employees
The mood at the corporate headquarters of HMT Watches was subdued on Friday morning as news of its reported closure spread. There are 1,105 employees at the company’s three factories and corporate head office.
The Union ministry of heavy industries and public enterprises is said to have decided to wind down the company, once describing itself as “keeping time to the nation”, 53 years after it started ticking. Manufacture will soon be stopped at Bangalore and Tumkur in Karnataka and Ranibagh in Uttarakhand.
The decision came after the failiure of repeated efforts to revive the ailing company. HMT Watches has made losses for about 20 years and the accumulated figure is in excess of Rs 1,500 crore. Efforts to restructure the operations haven’t turned thing around.
“I have no official communication from the ministry on closure. It was decided some time ago to downsize manpower from the present level of over 1,000. I have no information on shutting down the company,” said S Girishkumar, chairman and managing director. Half its personnel are employed in the Ranibagh factory (Nainital district).
At its peak, the company had a little over 400 models in its portfolio.
“There was a proposal some time ago to offer a Voluntary Retirement Scheme to employees as per the salary structure of 2007. If that is applied, each employee would get 2.5 times of his salary as the final settlement amount,” said a senior employee.
HMT Watches, a subsidiary of HMT Ltd, was established in 1961 at this city. During the peak of operations in 1991-92, it had over 8,000 employees and annual sales of Rs 300 crore. From 1994, it went into losses and never recovered, even after restructuring in 1999. The major setback was in 1986, when around 350 of its best engineers left to join Titan Watches, recalled an employee.
Since then, it went on to lose sales revenue and market share and iconic status to Titan. Many attempts were made to revive the company. But political intervention at every level, including appointment and promotion of employees, affected its functioning and demoralised staffers, an insider said.
Beside its manufacturing facilities at Bangalore, Tumkur and Ranibagh, it owns a total of 200 acres in these three cities. This should be worth around Rs 1,000 crore, majorly from the 60 acres of land in Bangalore, estimated to be valued at Rs 15 crore an acre.
In 2013-14, HMT Watches’ sales were Rs 7.5 crore and the net loss was Rs 233 crore, compared to Rs 242 crore  the previous year. Major factors affecting the performance were paucity of working capital, erosion of trade channels and high cost of borrowings.
The annual wage bill is Rs 35-40 crore.
A revival plan was awaiting government approval. However, the government has decided to close it down, based on the recommendation of the Board for Reconstruction of Public Sector Enterprises.

Modi campaign will be a benchmark: Harris DiamondSudipto Dey |  Sep 13, 2014

Modi campaign will be a benchmark: Harris Diamond
Interview with Chairman and chief executive, McCann Worldgroup, part of the Interpublic Group
Harris Diamond, chairman and chief executive, McCann Worldgroup, part of the Interpublic Group, was in India to announce McCann South Asia head Prasoon Joshi's elevation to an Asia-Pacific role. Sudipto Dey caught up with him. Excerpts:
You just announced Prasoon Joshi's elevation to an Asia-Pacific role. What does it mean for the India operations?
It means very little change. But it means more work for Joshi. Obviously, it is a recognition of what we see taking place in India and Asia. We see more Indian companies expand outside India - to Asia, and to the rest of the world. Clearly, Joshi will be better able to integrate our services. We have been doing that all along. This move will help us integrate India with the rest of Asia and the world.
McCann India has been aggressive over two to three years in getting clients. Are we now entering a phase of consolidation of the gains?
Like any business, our business is all about serving existing clients and seeking clients. That is the vitality of any business. I am a big believer in continuing expansion. It is important for all businesses to be able to grow.
Your earlier visit to India was in October. What are the key differences you find now?
I generally visit India two or three times in a year. This is my first visit since the general elections. I see a greater sense of confidence than a year ago. There is more willingness to invest with the belief the economy is going to move. For businesses like ours, built on consumer confidence, this is a pretty good moment.
In a healthy economy, we generally grow faster than the gross domestic product. We expect marketing budgets to increase. My meetings with companies we work with here were the most optimistic I have had with these in three years. There is optimism about what they are going to accomplish over nine to 18 months, usually the planning cycle.
Has the view of India, from within and outside, changed?
The election was very significant. It was when India voted for change. We are going to invest more in India, bring more people, build our operations further. We are building Craft Worldwide's (McCann's production business unit) global hub in India. As we grow, we need creative and strategic people. We need people who understand the web and digital world. Relationship marketing continues to grow.
You will see us grow with the economy, and at a faster rate than it.
India has been through a general election campaign. Going by the intensity of the campaign, Joshi has taken part in some ways, do you think political campaigns have come of age in India?
All (political) campaigns all over the world have changed. The world is disappointed now with corporate and governance institutions. Following the financial crisis, there has been a loss of confidence in almost all countries. What we saw in India was a campaign that clearly and aggressively played out a position, articulated a view. That is what successful politicians will have to do.
So, did it set a benchmark?
I don't have any doubt this campaign will serve as a benchmark. But I also have another view. It is not politicians who learnt from companies how to market, but the other way. The best marketeers in the world are usually the leaders. They understand how to talk to people and motivate them, and get people to advocate something. That, to some extent, we try to do with products and brands.
JOSHI: What is also important to understand is you need a certain mindset and a certain brand and then communication works. You can write the most beautiful slogan, but it will not work if it is not in line with the mood of the nation, or if people don't trust that the political product can deliver. The credit for success of this campaign goes to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He is the campaign, he is the product. Brand Modi was built by himself.
What were your key takeaways from the campaign?
A key takeaway has been the clarity of the message. Politicians have over the past couple of years been blurry, and there has been a status quo they have tried to preserve. To give Modi credit, there was clarity in his views, clarity in what he wanted to do, clarity in how he wanted to do it. There is a lesson to be learnt. There is a reason why the young came out to vote, and that has not happened in most countries.

The Borivali police in Mumbai are investigating the charges of rape that the woman pressed against NCP leader Laxman Dhobale, who is also a former minister of state.
"The complainant stated that Dhobale would call her in his office cabin and would force her to perform sexual activities. The woman alleged that Dhobale had some obscene pictures and raped her between 2011 and January 2013 by threatening her," said Balsingh Rajput, deputy commissioner of police, zone XI.
The police said that they have registered a case based on the woman's complaint and will be conducting investigations.
Meanwhile, Dhobale, while speaking to the media, said that the complainant was facing misappropriation charges which were being probed, and that is why she levelled allegations against him.
Dhobale has been booked under section 376 (punishment for rape) of the Indian Penal Code. The police said they will arrest Dhobale only after investigations are made.

Qadri suspends talks with PakistangovernmentPakistan's fiery Muslim cleric Tahir-ul-Qadri addresses his supporters outside the parliament building in Islamabad, Pakistan. Source: AP photo
PTI | Islamabad | Posted: September 13, 2014 5:15 pm
One of the two anti-government protest leaders in Pakistan on Saturday said that he has suspended talks with the PML-N government following a crackdown here on demonstrators demanding ouster of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
“We have suspended the talks as the government has begun arresting my workers in Islamabad and around the country,”Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT) chief and populist cleric Tahir-ul Qadri said, deepening the month-long political
impasse in the country.
“The government was unwilling to hear out the legitimate grievances of people who had been camped outside the halls of power for a month now,” Qadri was quoted as saying by Dawn.
Qadri and cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan have alleged that PML-N government has launched a crackdown on their supporters and nearly 300 opposition activists were picked up from across the capital yesterday.
“It is because of these arrests that we have decided to suspend dialogue with the government because they are playing a double game,” said Ghulam Ali, an Awami Tehreek spokesman.
PTI General Secretary Jehangir Khan Tareen also told a television channel yesterday that under the prevailing circumstances, it wasn’t possible for the party to keep talking to the government.
According to Tareen, the party handed its final set of demands to the government.
Meanwhile, Khan, the chairman of Pakistan Tehreek-i- Insaf, dismissed the impression that he was supported by the military, saying “I don’t need the Pakistan Army, as I already have an army of the people of Pakistan”.
Khan’s PTI wants Sharif’s ouster over alleged rigging in last year’s poll which his party lost, while Qadri wants to bring a revolution in the country.
Both leaders have been agitating since mid-August 14. At least three people have been killed and over 550 injured in violence during the protests.
The government this week said it has as reached an agreement with Khan’s party on most of their demands, except that of Sharif’s ouster which it said is non-negotiable.
The protests have raised concern about stability in the country of 180 million people, at a time when the government is battling a Taliban insurgency.
Meanwhile, hundreds of supporters of Khan and Qadri today stopped several prison vehicles carrying their arrested workers to jail after a hearing in an Islamabad court.
Police had yesterday arrested several dozens of their supporters from the capital accusing them for violating section 144 which prohibits a gathering of five or more people in Islamabad.
About 100 of them were brought to a court in the capital and the judge sent all of them on 14-day judicial remand to Adiala Jail in neighbouring Rawalpindi.
But activists of Khan and Qadri already present in the court stopped the police vehicles carrying the prisoners. The protesters deflated tyres of one van carrying more than 20 prisoners while several other vans steered out of the
mob as police pushed them continued…

Cars that drive themselves starting to chat with each otherCars that drive themselves starting to chat with each other

DETROIT, Sept 13:  
An Acura RLX sedan demonstrated an unusual way to tow another car this week: the vehicles were not physically attached. The second car drove itself, following instructions beamed over by the first in a feat of technology that indicates a new stage in automation is happening faster than many expected.
Systems that enable vehicles to communicate with each other have been developed in recent years in parallel with features that enable cars to drive themselves. Manufacturers and suppliers now are putting the two together in novel ways, with broad implications for vehicle safety and convenience.
General Motors Co, Honda Motor Co, which owns Acura, and other automakers are working with traditional suppliers and start-up firms. Tech giants Google, with its pioneering work on driverless cars, and Apple, which is working with automakers to embed greater connectivity in their cars, are accelerating the change.
"It is the mix of big companies -- Apple, Google, the automakers and the data aggregators -- that starts to create momentum. Two years ago, it was different. It was a promise. Today, it's reality," said Laurens Eckelboom, executive vice president of business development at Parkmobile, a smart-parking start-up whose investors include BMW AG and Ford Motor Chairman Bill Ford's venture capital firm Fontinalis Partners.
A "truck platooning" application by Peloton Technology, a start-up based in California's Silicon Valley, is intended to save fuel and reduce collisions.
As with virtual towing, a "platoon" of two heavy trucks use wireless communication and computer-controlled braking and acceleration to keep in close formation on the highway, according to a description by the company, which expects to start selling the technology late next year at $2,000 per truck plus a share of the projected operating savings.
The total price tag for widespread adaption of such features could be steep. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates automakers will need to spend billions of dollars to install safety systems that automatically assist drivers and could be mandated by 2020, when the industry expects the first self-driving cars to start easing onto roads.
WHO IS LIABLE?
There are other risks and issues including reliability, cybersecurity and legal liability.
"What happens if a self-driving car gets into an accident? Who is liable for the damages? Will the human 'co-pilot' be at fault or will the car's manufacturer?," the Centre for Insurance Policy and Research wrote last month, citing "a long list of safety and legal issues to iron out before self-driving cars hit the road."
All the razzle-dazzle technology promised by automakers and regulators "shouldn't take our eyes off the prize -- cars that don't crash," Jon Lauckner, GM's chief technology officer, said at the Intelligent Transport Systems World Congress in Detroit this week.
Citi analyst Itay Michaeli said the convergence of connected and automated technologies also has the potential to reduce vehicle emissions and fuel usage, and bring down vehicle operating and insurance costs.
Active safety, including hands-free driver assistance and accident avoidance, was a common thread of many technical discussions and technology advances on display at the ITS show, which attracted 10,000 engineers, scientists and researchers, ending on Thursday.
Automakers are starting to put more of the new technologies on the road "to get some experience and see how the market reacts in advance of the government requiring it," said Jeff Owens, Delphi Automotive chief technology officer.
Price is still a big question. Some advanced systems could cost two to three times more to develop than early adopters are likely to pay, several industry insiders estimated in conversations at the show.
Even with just a few semi-automated systems installed, the price tag remains stiff, although recent studies have shown car buyers are willing to pay about $3,000 to have hands-free driving capability.
The Chrysler Group, a unit of Italy's Fiat SpA, is charging nearly $3,500 for a technology bundle on its new 2015 Chrysler 200C sedan that includes adaptive cruise control, which automatically applies brakes and throttle to keep a vehicle a safe distance behind the one ahead; lane departure warning with lane keep assist, which automatically redirects a vehicle that is drifting out of its traffic lane; blind spot and cross path detection, which helps the driver monitor the presence of vehicles, and automatic park assist.
GM's Cadillac brand hasn't said how much its new Smart Cruise system will cost when it debuts in about two years. The system is designed to enable hands-free driving on the freeway with automatic steering, braking and throttle, as well as using GM's OnStar system to provide location, weather and traffic information to the automated systems.
But drivers should not expect to take a snooze. "We are talking about 'automated' driving features, not autonomous driving," with Smart Cruise, warned spokesman Jim Cain. "We will have strategies in place to keep the driver alert and engaged."

Indian dies of MERS in Saudi; family refuses to claimbodyPrint
Press Trust of India | Riyadh | Posted: September 13, 2014 5:21 pm | Updated: September 13, 2014 5:22 pm
An Indian worker has died in Saudi Arabia after contracting MERS coronavirus and his family is reluctant to repatriate the remains back home amid fears that they might get infected if they came in contact with the body.
Dasharati Sattaih from Telangana, who was working in Jeddah with a leading maintenance company, contracted the virus and died on June 20 this year, the Arab News reported.
The family was informed of Sattaih’s death but was also given misleading information about the virus by relatives in India. They reportedly warned them to be cautious as they could be infected with the disease if they touched the body, the paper said, citing its sources.
The employer is cooperating to repatriate the body to India but the family has refused to complete the formalities. This has led to the body lying unclaimed in a morgue, it said.
Repatriation or burial of an expat worker in the Kingdom can be a complicated process which can only be eased with the cooperation of the kin.
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is viral respiratory illness. The people suffering from the infection develop severe acute respiratory illness. They have fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
The WHO has recorded 837 confirmed MERS infections with at least 291 deaths. Most cases have occurred in Saudi Arabia.
In another incident, an Indian from Punjab, Akrim Singh, died after a prolonged illness in Jeddah.
The documentation for repatriation of the body was almost complete but suspicions about Singh being infected with the MERS virus caused a delay, the paper said.
An investigation, however, ruled out MERS being the cause of the death.
Sukhbir Singh, a friend of the deceased said, “Even if my friend had died of MERS, I would have taken his body back home without any fear of contracting the virus.”
The body was finally repatriated home.
Earlier, there were similar reports involving a Filipino nurse who had died of the MERS virus and whose family said that it was only safe to come in contact with the body after it had remained frozen for up to two months.

J&K floods: Omar announces relief packageinterior policy
Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah on Friday announced a package of relief for those affected by the worst floods in a century including a Rs. 200 crore assistance for Jammu region and the valley and Rs. 3.5 lakh for the kin of those who lost their lives in the disaster.
Addressing a press conference at the airport, Mr. Omar also announced a financial assistance of Rs. 75,000 as initial instalment for those who lost their homes and for rebuilding them.
The ex-gratia for the kin of the deceased will include Rs. 2 lakh announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier.
Free ration will be supplied to the affected for six months which includes 50 kgs of rice and authorities have been asked not to insist on documents, the Chief Minister said.
Announcing a slew of decisions taken by the State government, Mr. Omar said a team of six senior ministers led by Finance Minister Abdul Rahim Rather has been sent to apprise the Prime Minister of the situation in the State in the aftermath of the natural calamity.
Of the Rs. 200 crore assistance announced from the State’s distress relief fund, the Chief Minister said Rs. 100 crore will be given to each of the two provinces — Jammu and Kashmir.
“We want this to be paid in cash to the affected people like it was done during Uri earthquake in 2005 and Ladakh cloud burst.
“There should be not much of government role. Let people build their homes themselves,” he said and announced that cement and timber can be arranged from government depots and steel can be provided by the SAIL.
The Chief Minister has called an All Party meeting on Saturday to discuss the situation. “We will seek suggestions from other parties to improve the relief and rescue operations in the State,” he said.
Asking for setting up of insurance camps in the State for settling claims, the Chief Minister asked the Centre to direct the insurance companies to cover damage due to floods while deciding the compensation.
On death toll, Mr. Omar said no estimate could be given now because the situation is still fluid.
He requested the centre to clear the Rs. 22,000 crore ’Flood Management Plan’ proposed by the State government at the earliest. “This plan has been pending with the Centre for long. Now we request for early action on that,” he said.
The Chief Minister said the State had set up 137 relief camps in the Valley where over one lakh affected people were being attended to.
Mr. Omar said that medicines and disinfectants like chlorine, phenyl and DDT have been airlifted for supply in the affected areas to prevent any water-borne diseases.
“Clean drinking water is a problem. I have asked authorities to use the medicine liberally to reduce chances of disease,” Mr. Omar said, adding eight water filtration plans had been brought which will distribute drinking water.
He refused to give any time line for complete restoration of power supply. It had come down to 100 MW when water levels increased but now “we have reached 480 MW”.
Asked about the attacks taking place on rescue workers, Mr. Omar said “some people will never change” but gave an assurance that relief and rescue operations will continue “may be with more police and para-military personnel”.
He announced that the first batch of Hajis could leave from the State only by September 20. “We have asked the Haj authorities to allow other States to use the quota meant for Jammu and Kashmir. We can claim our quota towards the end,” he said.

Maharashtra: Uddhav wants to be CM; Sena s veiled warning to BJP on  excessive lust  for seatsBJP, Sena in tussle as Uddhav eyes CM post
Dharmendra Jore , Hindustan Times  Mumbai, September 13, 2014

With the Maharashtra assembly elections just a month away, the whiff of a likely win has intensified the tussle over the chief minister’s post in the saffron alliance.
While Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray said on Saturday his party would get the top job in the state, ally Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) maintained that the outcome of the October 15 polls would decide who gets the chief minister’s post.
Thackeray, who has till now avoided expressing his chief ministerial ambitions, on Saturday told the Aaj Tak news channel that he would not shy away from the responsibility although he was not dreaming of being the chief minister. “When the country wanted a change, Narendrabhai (Modi) came forward. Now, it is Maharashtra’s turn, and the people here, too, need a face when they go out to vote,” he said.
Uddhav’s stand makes it clear why he is opposed to the BJP’s demand for more seats. The BJP has been mounting pressure on the Sena to rework the existing seat-sharing agreement, but the Sena leadership is not too keen as they know that the party which contests more seats will have better chances of bagging the chief minister’s post.
A factional feud has broken out within the BJP, with at least five top BJP leaders — including state BJP president Devendra Fadnavis, Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari, Opposition leaders in the Council and Assembly Vinod Tawde and Eknath Khadse — projecting themselves as the next CM.
Meanwhile, in an editorial in the Sena mouthpiece Saamana, on Saturday said, “excessive lust leads to divorce” and asked the constituents of ‘Mahayuti’ alliance to exercise restraint while demanding extra share during seat allocation talks. Citing a recent court verdict, the party said, “All parties must give up the lust for more seats. To say we will stay in the coalition only if we get ‘so many seats’ is not right,” the editorial said.
The remarks are being considered a veiled criticism of BJP amid reports that the latter had sought more seats to contest this time around.

Brisk voting in 3 LS  33 assembly seats; will Modi magic workComments
Brisk voting was recorded in most of the 33 assembly seats and 3 Lok Sabha seats where bypolls were held on Saturday.
In Uttar Pradesh voting percentage was highest  in Mainpuri Lok Sabha constituency, which was vacated by Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh. Mulayam's grandnephew Tej Pratap Singh Yadav, 27, is contesting the seat on an SP ticket.
Among the voters was chief minister Akhilesh Yadav who landed in Saifai to cast his ballot.
Lack of enthusiasm was witnessed among the voters in the first two hours in all the constituencies, but slowly picked up later. By 3 pm around 44 % had cast their votes. Mild rains also affected the voter turnout.
The Mainpuri seat was held by SP, while all the eleven Assembly seats where voting is on were held by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
In West Bengal voting was brisk in Basirhat Dakshin while Chowringhee had lower voter turnout. Both the Left and the BJP accused the ruling TMC of terrorising voters, BJP's Basirhat candidate Samik Bhatatcharya said.
Over 62% polling was recorded in Basirhat Dakshin while nearly 40% voters exercised their franchise in Chowringhee  till 2 pm.
Voting was also brisk and peaceful in Telangana, Rajasthan and other states where bypolls are held.
Analysts are looking to see which way the wind blows in the bypolls spread across these nine states.
The results of two Lok Sabha seats — Vadodara which was vacated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Medak in Telangana was vacated by Telangana Rashtra Samithi chief and chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao — are unlikely to throw any surprises. But Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav’s prestige is at stake in his home turf Mainpuri, the third Lok Sabha seat.
The bypolls are being seen as an indicator of the popularity of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and opposition parties ahead of four assembly elections to be held this year.
They also pose a key question on the future of the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in Uttar Pradesh.
The BJP swept to power on the back of a so-called Modi wave this summer, but failed to maintain the momentum in last month’s by-elections in four states where it lost a majority of seats to the Congress party and its allies.
The BJP and its allies together won only eight of the 18 seats that went to the polls while the Congress and its allies won 10.
In the last Lok Sabha polls, a large number of OBCs and Dalits rallied behind the BJP across the Hindi belt. The shift dented the SP and BSP’s support base in the largest electoral state. The SP won just seven seats while Mayawati’s BSP drew a blank.
The grand alliance of the RJD-JDU-Congress could halt the BJP’s charge into this caste base. In the absence of such an alliance in Uttar Pradesh, any further losses may lead to an existential crisis for the two caste-based parties.
If the opposition parties — especially the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress in Rajasthan, Gujarat and Assam — can stop the BJP’s march, their claim about the Modi wave waning will receive a further boost.
With elections in Maharashtra and Haryana due next month, any by-election victory will also give the beleaguered Congress a fresh face saver after its humiliating Lok Sabha defeat.
But it may not be so easy for the opposition. Of the 33 seats, 11 are in Uttar Pradesh where the BJP swept 71 of 80 Lok Sabha seats.
In Gujarat and Rajasthan, where 13 assembly seats are up for grabs, the opposition could not even open its account in the general election.
Three seats are heading for the polls in Congress-ruled Assam where the BJP bagged 50% of Lok Sabha constituencies.
In West Bengal, the ruling Trinamool Congress will be desperate to win both seats as it wants to show that the Saradha scam has not hurt the party’s prospects.
For the BJP, a win or even a number two position in the results from Assam and Bengal will further cement its position as a fast emerging force, replacing traditional opposition parties like AGP and Left, respectively.
The by-elections in Chhattisgarh, Sikkim, Andhra and Tripura will test if the ruling parties can further consolidate their positions. Tripura is the only state where the Left is in power.

Independence of the judiciary is non-negotiable: CJI
The CJI's remarks were made against the backdrop of ending the collegium system of higher judicial appointments
Chief Justice of India R M Lodha today asserted that independence of judiciary is "non-negotiable" and has the inherent strength to foil any attempt to interfere with that.
The CJI's remarks were made against the backdrop of ending the collegium system of higher judicial appointments, but he did not make any direct reference to the law passed by Parliament in this regard.
Judicial independence is essential to maintain public confidence that an institution exists which would come to their "aid and rescue in case of any wrong committed by the Executive or anyone," he said addressing a seminar on 'Rule of Law Convention -2014'.
The CJI called upon the legal fraternity to keep away those who "play tricks to taint the judiciary," adding that any form of corruption in the judiciary "shield(s) impurity which is the worst form of aliment in thriving democracy."
"I won't speak on the issue (the Bill) but I would like to touch upon the issue of independence of the judiciary which is very dear to me. It is one thing which is non-negotiable," Justice Lodha, who is demitting office as CJI on September 27, said.

Tony Blair says hopes Scotland will vote to stay in the UK

(Fate of United Kingdom is…)
KIEV: Former Prime Minister Tony Blair said on Saturday that he hoped Scots would vote against independence, saying that breaking up the United Kingdom would not be a sensible step.
The fate of the United Kingdom is hanging on a knife edge as polls show Scots are evenly divided between support for the union and support for separatists led by nationalist leader Alex Salmond .
"I hope Scotland votes to stay part of the United Kingdom," Blair, who was born in Scotland, said at a security conference in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev .
"For all the reasons given by all the party leaders of the UK , in the 21st Century to rip up the alliance between our countries would not be sensible, politically, economically or even emotionally."
Blair, who served as British prime minister from 1997 to 2007, has been largely absent from the debate over Scottish independence, though his successor, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, has taken a leading role in the unionist campaign.

Open ducts, displaced slabs on the pavement and potholes on the road. Using the service lane on many stretches on Rajiv Gandhi Salai (formerly Old Mahabilapuram Road) has become a nightmare for residents and motorists. Some wonder why they must pay the toll fee for such poorly-maintained roads. The toll fee was revised a few months ago.
The quality or the safety of the service lanes have not improved. They put the lives of motorists and pedestrians at risk.
It is less than three years since the Tamil Nadu Road Development Company (TNRDC), which maintains the road, built service lanes with pavements, but today many sections are poorly managed, which includes vehicles being allowed to be parked at unauthorised areas.
“Roads are generally re-laid after five to six years. If the stretch is un-motorable, we do patch work. The ducts beneath the service lanes are for stormwater drains, drinking water lines, telecom lines and sewage lines. The respective agency opens it for their work. And then, they have to close it,” said an official of the TNRDC.
Many heavy vehicles have damaged many stretches of the service lane, said the official.
Complaints can be emailed to gmpo.tnrdc@gmail.com
“I avoid the service lanes. Potholes and open ducts are the reason. Also, haphazardly parked vehicles make it unsafe to drive,”
S.D Ezhilmathy, a regular commuter to Thoraipakkam
“Heavy vehicles such as trucks and vans must be prohibited from taking these service lanes as they charge a toll on the road. Parked vehicles have congested this road, making it difficult to walk.”

NIA team may visit Sri Lanka for probe into espionage case

Agency feels that more leads from the island nation can help unearth more facts
The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has sought the Union Home Ministry’s permission to send a team to Sri Lanka as part of the investigation into the espionage case in which a Sri Lankan national, Arun Selvarajan, was arrested in Chennai earlier this week.
“In the past 10 months, two requests under the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty have been sent to Sri Lanka, seeking details. The last one was dispatched in April. We have not yet received any response from the Sri Lankan authorities,” an NIA official said.
The purported revelations by those arrested in the case have indicated a conspiracy by the “masterminds,” allegedly by officials at the Pakistan High Commission in Colombo, to carry out espionage and terror strikes at vital installations and crowded places in Chennai and other parts of South India. The NIA believes that further leads from the Sri Lankan authorities can help unearth more facts.
The first arrest in the case was that of Thameem Ansari in September 2012, after which a Sri Lankan national, Muhammad Zakir Hussain, was arrested on April 29. With the assistance of intelligence agencies, the NIA then tracked down Arun. “Three modules set up by Amir Zubair Siddiqui, a former official with the Pakistan High Commission in Colombo, had been busted in the past two years,” the official said. Arun, who is wanted in Sri Lanka for allegedly harbouring LTTE members, sneaked into India about three years ago. “It is suspected that Amir Siddiqui and one of his junior officials at the Pakistan High Commission facilitated his escape.”

Chinas factory growth slows to near 6-year low in AugustChina’s factory growth slows to near 6-year low in August

Beijing, Sept 13,
China's factory output grew at the lowest pace in nearly six years in August while growth in other key sectors also cooled, raising fears the world's second-largest economy may be at risk of a sharp slowdown unless Beijing takes fresh stimulus measures.
The output data, combined with weaker readings in retail sales, investment and imports, pointed to a further loss of momentum as the rapidly cooling housing market increasingly drags on activity in other sectors from cement to steel and saps consumer confidence.
Industrial output rose 6.9 per cent in August from a year earlier - the lowest since 2008 when the economy was buffeted by the global financial crisis - compared with expectations for 8.8 percent and slowing sharply from 9.0 per cent in July.
"The August data may point to a hard landing. The extent of growth slowdown in the third quarter won't be small," said Xu Gao, chief economist at Everbright Securities in Beijing.
"The chances of cutting interest rates and bank reserve requirements have increased. I think they are more likely to cut interest rates."
Some analysts believe annual economic growth may be sliding towards 7 per cent in the third quarter, putting the government's full-year growth target of around 7.5 per cent in jeopardy unless it takes more aggressive policy measures. Experts reckon output growth of around 9 per cent would be needed to attain such a goal.
"Short of outright policy easing, China will likely miss the 7.5 per cent growth target this year, and a sharp economic slowdown will endanger the undergoing structural reforms," Liu Li-Gang and Zhou Hao at ANZ wrote in a note.
"As such, we reckon that Chinese authorities should further relax monetary policy as soon as possible to prevent the growth momentum from decelerating further."
Reinforcing the tepid economic activity, China's power generation declined for the first time in four years, falling 2.2 percent in August from a year earlier.
Jiang Yuan, a senior statistician with the bureau, said in a statement that the dip in August factory growth was due to a combination of factors: weak global demand, especially from emerging markets, and the slowdown in the property sector that hit demand for steel, cement, and vehicles.
China's economy got off to a weak start this year as first-quarter growth cooled to an 18-month low of 7.4 percent. A raft of stimulus measures pushed that up slightly to 7.5 per cent in the second quarter, but soft July and August data suggest the boost from those steps is already quickly waning.
"The government must take forceful policy measures to stabilise growth," said Li Huiyong, an analyst at Shenyin & Wanguo Securities in Shanghai.
Hard Landing?
Other activity indicators for August were also mostly weaker than expected.
Retail sales climbed 11.9 per cent, lagging forecasts of 12.1 per cent and slowing from 12.2 per cent in July.
Fixed-asset investment, an important driver of economic activity, grew 16.5 per cent in the first eight months from the same period last year, lower than forecasts, it said.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 16.9 per cent growth in fixed-asset investment, slowing from 17.0 per cent in Jan-July.
Much of the broader decline appears linked to the cooling property market, which is showing further signs of deterioration.
Property investment data also released on Saturday showed further declines in sales and new construction, while growth in housing-related goods such as home appliances, furniture and building materials all slowed.
Mortgage issuance in the first eight months fell 4.5 per cent from a year earlier, worse than a 3.7 per cent drop in January-July. Some would-be buyers have complained of long delays in getting loans as banks grow more cautious about their exposure to the sector, while others may be holding off in anticipation of further price declines.
Data on Friday showed that credit levels in China appeared to improve in August after an alarming drop in July, but remained below average. Bad loans are on the rise and banks expect more to go sour as the economy slows.
That followed trade data that showed China's exports were buoyant but import growth unexpectedly fell for the second consecutive month in August, posting its worst performance in over a year.
While most analysts expect the government to unveil more steps in coming months in order to meet its growth target for the year, the room for policy loosening is seen as limited after past stimulus programmes left many local governments saddled with piles of debt and fuelled rampant speculation, especially in the housing market.
Premier Li Keqiang said on Monday that China cannot rely on loose credit to lift its economy, and reassured a business forum that Beijing would continue to roll out modest "targeted" measures as policymakers look to shore up growth.

Manimekalai tells you how it can solve a major problem
Festivals are here. It is the time to share sweets with neighbours and relatives. Women are often confronted with the problem of having to decide on the right vessels to pack the sweets and savouries. Because, it is often a challenge to get the vessels back. The costlier the vessels, the greater the anxiety to get them back. Craft artiste Manimekali has a solution. Attractive boxes made of paper are available. A nice way indeed to offer sweets to friends and relatives on festival days. Nice, because you don’t have to worry about getting the container back.
Manimekalai specialises in paper crafts. For this festival season she has come up with boxes in different shapes, sizes and bright colours.
For Navarathri, she has made tiny boxes with which sundal could be served. “I have them with and without lids,”
She also has boxes made with magazine papers. “This can be used to keep turmeric, vermillion, betel leaves and other things that are regarded auspicious. However, I will not advise to keep eatables in boxes made from magazine papers as they are printed with ink,” she says.
She also teaches people how to make these boxes. Orders for the same can be placed with her.

Face to face with Vineeth
Vijay George
Malayalam cinema
Vineeth Sreenivasan plays many roles in the Malayalam film industry. Even as he returns as the hero in a new film, the singer, writer and director are not put on hold, says the multifaceted actor during a conversation
Vineeth Sreenivasan wears many hats and has added several feathers to each. After making his mark as a singer, he ventured into acting. Then he went behind the camera as a writer-director with Malarvady Arts Club and Thattathin Marayathu, which became a rage. His third movie, Thira, won critical acclaim for its theme and actors but could not make waves at the box office.
Now Vineeth is playing the hero in director Anvar Sadik’s Ormayundo Ee Mukham. He has completed writing a script for debutant director Prejith and plans to direct a movie next year.
In an exclusive interview with The Hindu Friday Review, Vineeth talks about his movies, dreams and more. Excerpts:
You had said that you are a reluctant actor. What is it that made you accept the lead role in Ormayundo Ee Mukham then?
I liked the script and the way the director Anvar Sadik narrated it to me. I trust him and am obediently following what he wants me to do. Jokes apart, I felt it was simple and cool. It’s a musical love story, a genre that I am comfortable in.
As an actor, what do you look forward to when you are offered a script?
The first thing that I check out is whether I will have to dance or fight, which I can’t do. I prefer not to attempt things that I am not confident about.
Your brief role in Ohm Shaanthi Oshaana was appreciated by viewers?
It’s my friend Jude Anthany Joseph’s film. We have been working together since the Malarvady Arts Club days. Everyone involved in the film were friends and so it was a relaxed affair.
Nivin Pauly, Aju Varghese, Alphonse Puthren and a few others who were part of Malarvady Arts Club have scaled heights in their career.
It gives me a great deal of happiness when I see Nivin, Aju and all of those who started off with Malarvady Arts Club getting so much appreciation and success. But, at the same time, it is a matter of concern that a few others haven’t got their due as yet, in spite of their talent. I don’t want to name them though. There are so many young, talented artistes in the industry who would excel if they get the right script.
Thattathin Marayathu was a simple story but very well narrated. What do you think worked in its favour?
I had taken quite some time to complete the script and that actually helped a lot. Whenever I have a plot in my mind, I prefer to carry it in my mind before putting it down on paper. I mull over the subject and the scene order is gradually formed. When I feel that a character talks in a particular way, I just record it in my phone. The process really helped me when I eventually started writing the screenplay.
But then, I always feel that a movie is a combined effort. It was my liking for Thalassery and my memories about the place that prompted me to write the story. It was a fairy tale dream about a Nair boy and a Muslim girl who fall in love, in the backdrop of the Arabian Sea. The actors, the visuals and the music all blended well.
But your last film, Thira, did not duplicate the success of Thattathin Marayathu…
Thira was an honest attempt. I didn’t want all my films to be gloss and wanted to narrate a relevant theme as I feel the crime rate is going up in an alarming way in today’s society. Usually such subjects become hero oriented on screen. But, in reality, there are several women who have done incredible work, contributions that have made a difference to society. For instance, women like Sunitha Krishnan, Anuradha Koirala and Somaly Mam. We had planned and researched a lot, but, perhaps, all that we had in mind couldn’t be conveyed to the viewers. We are going ahead with our plans to make a sequel to Thira.
It is alleged that Thira was inspired from films like the 2007 film Trade…
We were not inspired by any particular film but our references were the real life personalities that I mentioned. The basic idea was conceived after I read the Cambodian human rights activist Somaly Mam’s memoir, The Road of Lost Innocence. I feel that there is a particular format in stories of this genre. One or more persons get kidnapped and a search ensues, where the situations that they go through tend to be similar at times. Maybe that is why some viewers felt that we were inspired by other films that tackled the same subject.
Though you are a talented singer, why is it that you don’t sing more often?
While I am busy writing, I switch my phone off. I have been told by many that I was unavailable when they tried to reach me. It is not intentional though.
What about your next script, which will be directed by Prejith, with Nivin in the lead?
The shooting will start soon. (Smiles) It is also based in Thalassery and the decision was the director’s, as he thought the location suited the plot better. It is about a youth with lots of dreams but does he have it in him to actually turn those dreams into reality?
When are you planning to direct your next film?
I am planning to start it next year. The story is based on a real incident that happened in the life of one of my friends and it is a family subject.

Striking Gold in Princeton: 5 Tips for Any Aspiring Collectorreddit
I stumbled upon a hidden treasure recently, right in my backyard of Princeton, New Jersey. The Gilded Lion is a wonderful antique store, located at 24 Chambers Street, where it has stood since 1989.
The Gilded Lion is owned and operated by Leo Arons, one of America's top and most-knowledgeable rare book and antique connoisseurs who has been in the business for since the 1960s. A former research scientist for RCA, Leo is passionate about his work collecting, consulting, and appraising in the antique world. Leo brings academic excellence and appreciation of the details to his work in the Gilded Lion, and that unique combination draws customers worldwide.
When I entered the Lion's walls for the first time, I was thrilled to explore the magic of the store's two floors. It is something straight out of King Arthur's Court, with hundreds of unique items lining its walls. It is small but energetic.
After making friends with Leo, he recounted his life and career to me. A Cornell University graduate, he has lived in Princeton most of his life. At 93 years old, he appears straight out of central casting, with his beautiful white beard a Merlin of books and antique treasures. I told him that my hobby is to collect rare books--to engulf myself in literary gems.
He smiled and brought out a copy of Hobbes' Leviathan, even with its broken cover it is still one of the great books ever written in political theory. I bought it on the spot.
Originally published in the 1600s, Leviathan is a monument to political theory that continues to shape the way we think about man, society and the role of the individual, reason versus intuition, and politics as a whole. I encourage all of my readers to take a look at this masterpiece here .
Then he showed me a piece from his prime collection: a 1922 first edition copy of Ulysses.
My heart skipped a beat. I didn't have enough money to buy so I optioned it. Knowing that your biggest investments yield the greatest results, I remain motivated to share Ulysses with its next owner.
Leo offered some great advice for young collectors on how to succeed in the business.
1. Buy things that you love and that you can live with for decades. You might not be able to sell right away, so you want something with an inherent value that you can love, appreciate, and eventually find the right buyer for. Just like Warren Buffet said,
There comes a time when you ought to start doing what you want. Take a job that you love. You will jump out of bed in the morning. I think you are out of your mind if you keep taking jobs that you don't like because you think it will look good on your resume. Isn't that a little like saving up sex for your old age?
2. You make money on the things you have to stretch to buy. If my column has taught readers anything for the hundreds of brilliant entrepreneurs profiled here, I hope it is this: innovation is borne of risk.
Still don't believe me? Look at Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak--they're calculated risks to create Apple continues to pay off today. Or Henry Ford, who sold his Model Ts below cost to create a buying frenzy--something that helped him revolutionize production by creating a huge demand.

3. Keep good records. As many successful entrepreneurs and NFTE students alike have claimed, the importance of basic bookkeeping cannot be underestimated. Without good records, you cannot perform basic analytical functions needed to grow your business, complete the most basic government and tax filings, and its often the basic difference between serving your clients and not.
Brianna Cregle, a student in Rutgers University Masters of Library and Information Science program, with local legend Leo Arons.
4. Always treat your customers with respect and integrity. As any consumer will tell you, sometimes customer service is worth a million dollars. Its true that your customers can make or break your business, because without them there is no business. And, you never know the significance of a customer interaction until after its over. Take for example, a story told by one serial entrepreneur in Inc. magazine : his hands-on approach to one midnight caller led his startup directly to the huge account and capital infusion they needed to grow.
5. Learn the history of the antique or rare book that you are buying. For this one, Leo gave me a fascinating example. He has a letter from King Henry VIII's financial mastermind to the spymaster in the English court. In it, he refuses to refund the expenses claimed by the spymaster on his early expense report. It is a priceless letter that holds many insights in this time in England and espionages then.
One such example from Henry's court ( Source )
6. And lastly, get your location right. Like labyrinth books, Leo's store benefits greatly from being in a wonderful place like Princeton when people greatly value learning.
Leo Arons is one of the most widely-read and insightful leaders in this business and I am honored to have the opportunity to impart some of his wisdom here.

Hindu tradition of tolerance is showing strain  says Fali NarimanHindu tradition of tolerance is showing strain, says Fali Nariman
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, September 13, 2014
First Published: 00:11 IST(13/9/2014) | Last Updated: 16:19 IST(13/9/2014)

Eminent jurist Fali Nariman hit out at the Narendra Modi government on Friday calling it 'majoritarian', and also expressed the view that Hinduism is losing its tolerance.
Arguing that the ‘Hindu tradition of tolerance is showing strain’, he said, “My apprehension is Hinduism is changing its benign face because…it is believed and proudly proclaimed by a few ,and not contradicted by those at the top, that it is because of their faith and belief that Hindus have been now put in the driving seat of governance.”
Nariman made this remark at a routine annual lecture organised by the National Commission of Minorities. Sparks flew, as the eminent jurist, chosing to be "unpopular rather than untruthful", highlighted increasing instances of hate speech, and indicated that Commission was failing to discharge its responsibility.
Minister of Minority Affairs, Najma Heptullah, responded by respecting Nariman’s right to hold his views, but claimed that the government and Prime Minister Modi were committed to safeguarding the rights and liberty of all minorities.
 
In his lecture, Nariman said he "welcomed" but also "feared" the strong majoritarian government in power at the centre.
 
 Outlining the varied ways in which regimes dealt with minorities – either through forceful suppression and eradication, coercive or hostile toleration, voluntary or involuntary assimilation – Nariman highlighted that India’s founding fathers had chosen a liberal path, of "affirmative action for protection and preservation".
 
Yet, he said minorities were at "crossroads today" because "the body set up by parliament to protect minorities has omitted to take effective steps to protect them". He noted the almost daily "tirades" by individuals and groups against citizens belonging to a religious minority and agreed with the criticism that the government at the centre had done nothing to stop these tirades.
 
But saying governments will do what they do to advance their political interests, Nariman pointed to the role of the Commission. “The main task of the commission is protecting interests of the minorities. And how does one protect interests of a minority…who are on a daily basis lampooned and ridiculed and spoken against in derogatory language?”
He implored the NCM to use provisions of the law to initiate action against those indulging in hate speech. “A majoritarian government is elected and exists mainly on the vote of the majoritarian community..The Commission is an independent statutory body.”
 
Heptullah said that everyone had a right to have an opinion, and the right to like or dislike other people’s opinions. But she went out of her way to assure that the government was committed to minority interests. “There was even apprehension that if BJP came to power, if Modi became PM, the Ministry of Minority Affairs would be abolished. Nothing could be further from truth,” she said.
She said she had asked the PM what he would like her to do after taking charge, and Modi had told her to implement manifesto promises for minorities. “He also said with a lot of anguish that even after 60 years, Muslim community was deprived of basic rights of a citizen – these rights included education, shelter, security of a job, security of life.”
Modi, she said, had told her that it was her responsibility to create confidence among minorities that the government cares for them as much as it cares for the minority. “This is my guiding principle.” The minister also referred to the Sachar committee report to underline the backwardness among Muslims.
 
Nariman was also critical of the judiciary and said earlier, the courts had shown special solicitude for minorities  regarded minority rights as preferred freedoms. “Minority rights are still regarded by the courts as fundamental rights, but, and I say this with regret, they are no longer regarded by the Judges of today as preferred freedoms.”  he said.

To prove this, researchers looked at the top 100 most commonly used words on Twitter.
Out of the 100 most used words, only two were shortened "RT" (shortened for re-tweet) and "u" (shortened for you). The rest of the words averaged about 4.5 letters and none were contractions.

"Twitter may actually be improving its users' writing as it forces them to wring meaning from fewer letters," researchers argued.
According to them, a person tweeting has no option but concision and in a backward way, "the character limit actually explains the slightly longer word length we see".
Given finite room to work, longer words mean fewer spaces between them, which means less waste.

"Although the thoughts expressed on Twitter may be foreshortened but there is no evidence here that they are diminished," the study concluded.

Kashmir floods: Man risks life to get help for ailing infant sonComments
He knew his options were limited and he had to act fast. Ghulam Hassan had to choose between the life of his ailing two-month-old son or his own, so he decided to put his life at risk to save the infant.
Hassan, a resident of Bemina locality in Srinagar city, used a water storage tank to cross the flood waters to get relief for his son Adnan and starving family and nearly lost his own life in the process.
Until a fortnight ago, the couple were celebrating the birth of their first child after six years of marriage, unaware that soon they will battling for survival due to the torrential rains.
"We were caught off guard and in no time our house was flooded with water. We waited for a day without food, water or electricity. As the water level continued to rise we took shelter on the roof of our house," Hassan who was standing in a queue at volunteer run medical camp told PTI.
"The clothes that we were wearing were the only things we were left with," he said.
Initially unaware about the intensity of the flood, the family thought their ordeal was short-lived, but it was not to be.
"The next morning my son fell ill and we had nothing to feed him or his lactating mother who was still recuperating after a cesarean," Hassan said.
He said he waited for some help to arrive, but when no rescue team was in sight, he decided to take the biggest risk of his life.
"I had to choose between my life or my son's life, I decided to risk mine to save my son," Hassan said.
Noticing that the water level was receding, Hassan emptied a water storage tank to use it as a floating device and jumped into the water to get some help for his son.
After floating and swimming for some time, he was so exhausted that there was a moment he decided to give up, but a team of volunteers noticed and rescued him, Hassan said.
"They took me to a medical camp being run by few doctors at a nearby mosque, where I was given few medicines and some baby food, eatables for my family and some clothes," Hassan said.
And he returned to his family.
"A team of volunteers went with me, but their boat could not move ahead because of inundated houses and boundary walls.
"I somehow managed to swim back to my house with all the items tightly packed in polythene bags. That was for the first time in three days that my family had something to eat," Hassan said. The next day the volunteers tried again to reach the family and after facing many hurdles they somehow managed to rescue them.
Hassan, who was now living with his relatives in Barzulla Bagar, said that many people were still trapped in his area and he feared that some might have lost their lives, as there was no information available about them.

Sensex  Nifty Off from New Peak on Profit-booking  End BetterGold, Silver Rebound on Global Cues
Mumbai: After rallying to new peak on Monday on crude oil drop and fund inflows, profit-booking by operators in a mid-week ahead of key macro-economic data on late Friday kept the Sensex and Nifty under check, still ending up by 0.13 per cent and 0.23 per cent respectively, extending gains for the fifth straight week.
The market commenced the week on a strong footing as overseas funds increased bets on growth optimism and a lower oil price which gave a boost to sentiments.
Later, the tussle was seen throughout the week between bulls and bears that saw the former gaining dominance over the latter, as both the key indices survived to end in green.
Hopes of further implementation of reforms by the new government kept the market from falling further.
Supreme Court's reserving order on Coal Block allocation case led to uncertainty for the market players.
Weakness in emerging markets on expectations of earlier key interest rates hike by the US Federal reserve, which might force foreign funds to shift their funds from emerging markets, also weighed on the market sentiment.
A lower crude price will help India, which imports about 80 per cent of oil needs, to contain CAD and fiscal deficit.
The end-session saw some buying by operators in blue-chip stocks and also retail investors in second-line counters, helping the Sensex to land in positive terrain at close.
The Sensex opened higher at 27,145.12 and surged to an intra-day record high of 27,354.99 and fell back below 27K-mark at 26,904.50, before recovering some ground to settle the week at 27,061.04, showing a small gain of 34.34 points or 0.13 per cent.

Ukraine forces repel rebel attack on DonetskairportA Ukrainian army helicopter flies over their positions in Debaltsevo, Donetsk region, Ukraine, Friday, Sept. 12, 2014. The cease-fire between the separatists and the Ukrainian military in eastern Ukraine has largely held. (Source: AP)
Associated Press | Kiev | Posted: September 13, 2014 5:48 pm | Updated: September 13, 2014 5:49 pm
Despite the cease-fire agreement, renewed fighting flared up Saturday in eastern Ukraine between pro-Russian rebels and government forces, while Moscow sent a second convoy of trucks into Ukraine without Kiev’s consent.
Ukraine’s military operation said in a statement that it had successfully repelled a rebel attack on the government-held Donetsk airport, which came under artillery fire from rebel positions late on Friday.
Despite the truce imposed last week, continuous rocket fire could be heard overnight in Donetsk. A statement posted on the city council website said that shells had hit residential buildings near the airport, although no casualties were reported. A column of three GRAD rocket launchers, all its rockets still in place, was seen moving freely through the rebel-held city on Saturday morning.
Ukrainian authorities also admitted for the first time that they have inflicted casualties on the rebel side since the start of the ceasefire.
Col. Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, said that 12 rebel fighters had been killed by Ukrainian forces near Sea of Azov city of Mariupol, where he said they were doing reconnaissance work. Lysenko also said that six Ukrainian servicemen had died since the start of the truce.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has been at pains to prove that the ceasefire deal has yielded improvements on the ground in east Ukraine. On Friday, he lauded the deal, which has been riddled by violations since it was imposed last week, as a “fragile but efficient peace process.”
On Saturday Russia also sent a convoy across the border of Ukraine, loaded with what Russian reports said was humanitarian aid, without the approval of Kiev or oversight of the international Red Cross. A similar convoy in August was loudly condemned by Ukrainian officials as an invasion, but this time around Lysenko simply called the move “illegal”. The country’s top leaders have remained silent, underscoring how dramatically the mood has shifted in the Kiev government since a ceasefire deal was struck.
The last truck crossed onto Ukrainian soil early Saturday from the Russian border town Donetsk, some 200 kilometers (120 miles) miles east of the Ukrainian city with the same name, Rayan Farukshin, a spokesman for Russia’s customs agency said.
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe’s observer mission to the Russian-Ukrainian border said 220 trucks had crossed into Ukraine. Only 40 trucks were checked by the Russian border guard, while the other 180 were waved straight through, it said. None of the vehicles were inspected by the Ukrainian side or by the ICRC.
“Ukraine border guards and customs were not continued…

Assembly polls in the state last thing on JK CMsmindPress Trust of India | Srinagar | Posted: September 13, 2014 5:39 pm
With Jammu and Kashmir engrossed in a massive rescue and relief operation, Chief Minister Omar Abdullah on Saturday said the last thing on his mind at the moment was holding of assembly elections in the state where the term of the house ends on January 19.
“I could not care less about elections. I have no time to think about elections at this moment. I have no inclination at this point of time. My only inclination is to ensure rescue, relief, rehabilitation, restoration and peace,” he said.
The State Chief Minister said, “Elections are not my problem. Those who have to decide can decide. Once they decide, I will decide what to do. But at this point of time, I could not care less.”
The Election Commission on Friday said it was watching “very closely” the situation in the flood-ravaged Jammu and Kashmir and decision on conducting assembly polls will be taken after things come to some shape there.
“We are watching the situation very closely. After things come to some shape, we will find out (and) depending upon the situation, a decision will be taken,” Chief Election Commissioner VS Sampath had told reporters.
The term of the 87-member J-K assembly ends on January 19 next year.
Flood triggered by heavy rain in Jammu and Kashmir has claimed around lives so far and left thousands homeless. It has also caused extensive damage to road, rail and telecommunication infrastructure in the state.

India keen to enhance cooperation with Vietn...ASEAN
(India is looking to enhance…)
NEW DELHI: India is looking to enhance cooperation with Vietnam in defence, security and political arena as there is immense potential for bilateral engagement between the two nations, President Pranab Mukherjee said today.
The President noted that India-Vietnam partnership has reached a "high point" and is also beneficial to ASEAN and the region beyond.
"Political, defence and security cooperation is one of the major pillars of our cooperation. We are of the view that there is much more potential that can be realised in this area and both sides are working towards it along with our regional partners," Mukherjee told Vietnamese News Agency (VNA) on the eve of his departure for a four-day state visit to the country.
Mukherjee, who will meet the top leadership of Vietnam including President Truong Tan Sang, said his trip is aimed at enhancing the mutual goodwill between the two countries and translate it into further mutually beneficial cooperation.
"I am confident that our mutual goodwill can be translated into further mutually beneficial cooperation as there is immense potential for future cooperation. Moreover, our partnership is also beneficial to ASEAN and the region beyond.
During my visit to Vietnam in the coming days, I look forward to strengthening this partnership through discussions with my counterpart His Excellency President Truong Tan Sang and other leaders of Vietnam," he said.
The visit, which will take Mukherjee to capital Hanoi and the historical Ho Chi Minh City, is set to witness inking of a number of memorandums between the two countries including one between ONGC Videsh Limited (OVL) and Petro Vietnam with regard to exploration activities in the South China Sea, a move opposed by China.
"Bilateral relations between India and Vietnam are excellent. They have never been better than what they are today. Our strategic partnership, which was established in 2007, is now entering its eighth year of implementation.
In recent years, our relations have witnessed a continuous broadening and deepening in all aspects. Our relations are marked by strong mutual trust, understanding, support and a convergence of views on various regional and international issues," he said.
The President said the foundation of friendship between India and Vietnam laid by former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and President Ho Chi Minh has flourished over the years and has brought us to a "high point today".
Lauding Vietnam, Mukherjee said that India has great admiration for the Vietnamese people, their fortitude, courage and for their determination to succeed against odds.
He also called the South East Asian nation as an "important pillar" in India's Look East Policy.
"Vietnam has been a strategic partner for India both within ASEAN and in the wider region. We deeply appreciate Vietnam's support for India at all regional and international fora and look forward to further deepening this aspect of our cooperation.
With ASEAN integration acquiring momentum, we have deepened our regional interaction, stepped up initiatives to promote connectivity and expanded people-to-people links to enhance our role in the new era. I see India and Vietnam as partners, contributing to peace, prosperity and stability in the wider region," he said.
The President said there was a need to undertake more efforts to bring together the youth force of the two nations.
"There is, however, a gap in information about each other among the younger generations. I understand that both sides are working on increased youth and cultural exchanges including exchange of cultural content, films and television programmes which can address this gap.
I am also happy to note that direct flight services between our two countries will start shortly. This will give a major boost to increased business, tourism and people-to-people contacts," he said.
Mukherjee said the two countries have a convergence of views and strong cooperation at all regional and international fora.
"There is strong mutual support and understanding between us," he said.
The President, who last travelled to the country in 2011 as India's Finance Minister, said there is a lot of potential that remains to be tapped between the two nations in the economic arena.
 
"In economic cooperation too, we have made a lot of progress. Our trade volume has increased almost three and a half times since 2007. We are well on track to meet our trade targets. The prospects for investment cooperation are also bright.
More and more Indian companies are now looking at Vietnam for doing business. There is a great interest among businessmen for future cooperation and I am confident that with efforts on both sides, we will be able to increase our trade and investment levels several fold, in the years to come," he said.

"There have been incidents when the helicopters flying at low altitude were targeted with stones and one of the helicopter was in fact hit by several stones causing some minor damage on the body and near the rotary wings," a senior air force officer told PTI.
The officer said that the helicopter, however, returned safely to the base where the damage was being assessed. The army too says that some of its boats deployed for relief and rescue operations were attacked by stone pelters.
"It is unfortunate that the people who are trying to save them are being attacked, but we will not give up and will continue with our work till help does not reach to every single soul," said air marshal SB Deo, director general of air operations.
There have been reports that at certain places people are being instigated by separatists to target and disrupt the relief and rescue work being undertaken by the air force and the army.

Deo said that he could understand that there was anger amongst the people and he has empathy for those who lost everything in the floods.
Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah too has condemned the targeting of the army and air force personnel who are engaged in the relief and rescue operations across the Valley and appealed to the "disruptive elements" to allow these operations.
"These disruptive elements are fishing in the troubled waters, they must not become impediments in the relief and rescue work being carried out by different agencies. "They will get plenty of time afterwards," Abdullah said.

Rest of India pitches in
Thirteen tonnes of water purifying tablets and six water filtration plants with a capacity to filter 1.2 lakh bottles per day has already reached Srinagar, he said.
Suction pumps and other engineering equipment from Vishakhapatnam have also reached the flood affected area for relief work, he said, adding twelve sewage pumps from Delhi have also been dispatched to the Valley.
The spokesman said communication equipment of department of telecommunication, army, BSNL and some private companies have also been dispatched to restore the network.
Also, thirty generator sets of 3 to 5 KVA capacity have been sent to Srinagar to provide continuous power supply in relief camps and field hospitals, he added.
Besides these, as many as 8,200 blankets and 1,119 tents have been provided to the flood victims, he said, adding, 80 medical teams of the Armed Forces Medical Services are already operating in full swing.
Four field hospitals have been established in Avantipur, Pattan, Anantnag and Old Airfield where medical aid is being provided to the ailing people, he said, adding that till now, they have treated more than 22,500 patients.
Union home secretary Anil Goswami, who is monitoring the rescue and relief operations met CM Abdullah on Saturday.
 
Goswami, who is camping in Srinagar for the past two days, had earlier held a series of meetings with the officials of Indian Army, Indian Air force, state administration and other agencies engaged in the relief and rescue works.

Maharashtra: Congress  NCP discuss prospects of pre and post poll tie-up#prithviraj chavan #congress #maharashtra assembly elections 2014 #maharashtra
Mumbai: With the seat-sharing talks between coalition partners Congress and NCP remaining stuck ahead of October 15 Assembly elections, Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan on Saturday said that parleys are on to decide whether a pre-poll or a post-poll alliance is suited for the ruling partners.
"The forthcoming Assembly elections will be the sixth election which Congress and NCP will fight. Discussions are on whether a post-poll or a pre-poll alliance is favourable for both Congress and NCP," Chavan said.
The NCP and Congress had fought the first election after the formation of the NCP (in 1999), as rivals, before coming together to form a post-poll alliance. After that, however, they have been pre-poll allies and have fought all elections from 2004 together.
"The forthcoming Assembly elections will be the sixth election which Congress and NCP will fight. Discussions are on whether a post-poll or a pre-poll alliance is favourable for both Congress and NCP," Chavan said.
To a question on who will be the next chief minister, Chavan evaded a direct reply, saying, "He will be the one who has social acceptability." Chavan, a senior Congress leader and former Union minister, said that though the campaign for recently-concluded Lok Sabha elections was run in the US Presidential style, "it remains to be seen whether the same is applicable in the Assembly elections."
To a query on Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray's chief ministerial ambitions, Chavan said that the Sena president has no experience in governance. "Uddhav was not part of the previous Sena-BJP government (in 1995)," he said.
On Congress' strategy to take on the saffron alliance, Chavan said that "poor performance" of the Sena-BJP in the municipal corporations of Mumbai and Nagpur will be highlighted.
When asked whether the decision of the Democratic Front (DF) government to provide reservations to Maratha and Muslims communities in government jobs and educational institutions was motivated by vote bank politics, Chavan replied in negative.
On queries regarding the leadership of Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi, Chavan said, "He (Rahul) is trying to reinvent the party and bring in new leadership." When asked to list challenges the state is facing, Chavan said the main challenge is to bring uniform development. "Priority is Mumbai as well as rural development," he added.
Chavan, often criticised from within Congress and ally NCP, besides the opposition over his "leadership abilities", said that the atmosphere of cynicism prevailing at the time of his anointment as chief minister has now improved. "Since the time I took over as chief minister I had focused on improvement of policy framework," he added.

Parties pledge to rebuild flood-ravaged Jammu and Kashmir#jammu and kashmir #jammu and kashmir floods #pdp #nc #congress #bjp #mehbooba mufti #saifuddin soz #jugal kishore
Srinagar: Pledging to rebuild the lives and livelihood in flood-hit Jammu and Kashmir, political parties on Saturday came together to issue a joint appeal to individuals and organisations within and outside the state to help affected people in "every possible way". A resolution was passed at an all-party meeting, convened by state Chief Minister Omar Abdullah to deliberate over flood crisis response, which expressed complete solidarity with the affected people and firmly resolved to rebuild the lives, livelihoods, private properties and public infrastructure.
PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti, Congress leader Saifuddin Soz and BJP's Jugal Kishore were among those who attended the meeting. The political parties appealed to all individuals and organisations within and outside the state to come forward to help the people of the state in every possible way, it said while appreciating the contribution of civil society bodies, NGOs, self-help groups, individuals and other stake-holders.
It also conveyed appreciation for the support given to the state in the hour of crisis by the government of India and its agencies, including army, air force and NDRF. The all-party meeting expressed deep condolence over the loss of precious lives in the unprecedented floods which struck the state, the resolution said.
PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti, Congress leader Saifuddin Soz and BJP's Jugal Kishore were among those who attended the meeting.
All political parties expressed deep sympathies with those injured and displaced and those who suffered on account of the calamity. After the meeting, Abdullah said all parties were supportive of the rescue and relief operations. He appreciated the fact that the parties came together and sent out a joint message.
"If NC and PDP can sit together and send out a joint message, if BJP and Congress can sit together and send out a joint message, rest of the people too can join hands in this hour of crisis," he said.
He said that several good suggestions were made by different parties. Main opposition PDP presented a 10-point programme.  Mehbooba said this is "no time to do politics" and first priority is rescue and rebuild. "Everyone, the rich and the poor have been affected." She said that there should be a joint appeal at national and international level for whatever help can be provided.
One of the suggestions was that all MPs should contribute five per cent of MPLAD funds for reconstruction of the state.

"Five battalions of Central Reserve Police Force have been summoned to maintain law and order situation in the district and 7 SDPOs, 18 police inspectors, 168 sub-inspectors, 2,850 constables and 838 homeguards will be
deployed during the poll process," he added.

Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Nabam Tuki assures action to improve law and order#nabam tuki #arunachal pradesh #law and order #kc chacko #murder
Itanagar: Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Nabam Tuki and Home Minister Tanga Byaling have assured visible actions to improve the deteriorating law and order in the Itanagar capital complex.
This assurance was given when a delegation of Arunachal Pradesh Chamber of Commerce & Industries (ACCI) called on them here on Friday.
Giving a patient hearing, the duo expressed their deep shock at the tragic incident of murder of prominent trader KC Chacko and assured steps to be initiated soon to redress the grievances, a press release from the CMO said here on Saturday.
This assurance was given when a delegation of Arunachal Pradesh Chamber of Commerce & Industries (ACCI) called on them here on Friday.
Chacko was kidnapped by armed miscreants from Naharlagun on August 28 and his decomposed body was recovered by police from Doimukh on September 5.
Assuring that all the killers would be brought to book, the CM informed that inquiry would be made as to why the police arrived late at Chacko's residence, why the naka at Model village was lifted.
The strength in all police stations is very less because of no recruitment during the last few years but the strength will increase soon, the CM said.
Byaling said that the Capital Complex would be divided into three zones under the charge of a sub inspector, police personnel to be deployed in each sector, more police control room (PCR) vehicles will be procured and deployed with an SI as in-charge and all cases of extortions would be dealt with seriously and extortionists taken to task.
The police helpline '100' would remain functional round the clock and special branch personnel would be reshuffled forthwith, he said.

J&K ministers meet PM Modi  want floods declared as national calamity#jammu and kashmir #jammu and kashmir floods #tracking the modi government #narendra modi #ali mohammed sagar
New Delhi: A delegation of ministers from Jammu and Kashmir on Saturday called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and requested him to declare the recent floods in the state as "national calamity" and also ensure smooth supply of food grains and other essential items. The delegation, led by state's Finance Minister Abdul Rahim Rather, submitted a memorandum to the Prime Minister putting forth several demands to help the state government which was grappling with the worst deluge in over 100 years.
"The Prime Minister was very positive and assured us complete support to overcome the crisis," senior state minister Ali Mohammed Sagar, who was a part of the delegation said.
The delegation requested the Prime Minister to declare the tragedy in the state as "national calamity" so that other benefits including more grants from the Centre and soft loans from financial institutions could be availed.
"The Prime Minister was very positive and assured us complete support to overcome the crisis," senior state minister Ali Mohammed Sagar, who was a part of the delegation said.
In the absence of any guidelines on declaring any disaster as national calamity, the Centre decides on case to case basis taking into account intensity and magnitude of the calamity, level of relief assistance, capacity of the state government to tackle the problem, the alternatives and the flexibility available within the plan to provide succor an relief.
Sagar said that the delegation requested the Prime Minister for immediate relief of Rs five lakh each to people whose houses had been damaged in the floods. He said that the state government had started distributing 60,000 metric tonnes food grains among the people from Saturday.
"From today onwards, we have started distributing it among the people. We have requested the Centre for more food grains and the Prime Minister has assured us the same and even more, if the state government could have the storage facilities," Sagar said.
He conceded that there was anger among the public and said "it was natural. After all they have been trapped in their homes for nearly six days with no relief coming their way. The anger is justified but at the same point, there was little we could have done.
"Our entire state machinery was submerged in water. It was Chief Minister Omar Abdullah and I who started a mini-secretariat from Hari Nivas along with a handful of officers. We got our act together and now the relief operation is in full swing," Sagar said.

The vanishing Parsis
Special Arrangement A still from the film
TOPICS
documentary films
“Qissa-e-Parsi” is an intimate portrait of the Parsi community and its anxieties
When Divya Cowasji arrived in Mumbai in 2008, it felt like a happy homecoming. A lonely Parsi who grew up in small towns, Divya felt excited to be in the city that 2/3rds of the Parsi population considers its home. Gradually, it led to an interest in the ways of her community which has only deepened in subsequent years.
Divya and Shilpi Gulati, former students of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) have now made a short documentary that presents the story of Parsis. Titled Qissa-e-Parsi, the documentary produced by the Public Service Broadcasting Trust and the Ministry of External Affairs was screened recently at the Open Frame Film Festival in New Delhi.
At TISS for their Masters dissertation, Divya and Shilpi worked on their respective communities and felt that the research could also lead to documentaries on the same subject. The first of these was Dera Tun Dilli, a film on the first-generation refugees of the Derawal community (who hail from Dera Ismail Khan in Pakistan) living in Delhi.
Intended as an introduction to the Parsi community, Qissa-e-Parsi comprises interviews with common and eminent Parsis. They include Bejan Daruwalla, Cyrus Broacha and Sooni Taraporevala among others, who speak on matters as diverse as Parsi food, history and their distinctive, wry sense of humour. The result is a light-hearted portrait of the community that genially explains what it means to be a Parsi.
“Everybody was very enthused with the idea of the documentary, and even celebrities were generous with their time,” says Shipli.
Having arrived in Gujarat between the eighth and tenth centuries after the conquest of their homeland Iran by Arab Muslims, the Parsis gained prominence as a community of traders and entrepreneurs under the British rule. It was during this time (1680-1780) that the Parsi association with Mumbai began, after waves of migration from Gujarat. As the documentary explains, it is an association that has come to shape the city as much as the Parsis.
Although the official brief was to “showcase the Parsi community to audiences abroad” and highlight its contributions, the film is more than a celebratory document. It confronts the community’s anxieties regarding its dwindling numbers and attendant debates regarding conversion and intermarriage. While children of men marrying outside the community are considered Parsi, those of women marrying outside are not.
The directors will explore this subject in greater detail in their next documentary. A film on Parsi theatre is also in the offing.

New motor bill proposes steep penalties against offenders  seven-year jail for child deathComments
Soon, motorists caught speeding, driving drunk or jumping red lights may not get away with a light fine and a few stern words from the traffic cop.
The punishment would get harsher as the gravity of the offence increases — a Rs. 3-lakh fine and not less than seven years in jail for causing the death of a child; Rs. 5 lakh in penalty and three months in jail for a manufacturing fault in a vehicle; a Rs. 1-lakh fine for driving an unregistered vehicle.
All these and more are part of the new draft Road Transport and Safety Bill, 2014 unveiled by the road transport ministry on Saturday. The ministry has proposed hiking penalties three-to-50-fold  and other stringent action that includes suspension or cancellation of driving licence.
In the draft bill, speeding invites a fine of Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 12,500 — up from the existing Rs. 400-1,000 — and suspension of licence for up to eight weeks depending on how much you have exceeded the speed limit. For instance, the steepest fine is for going 40kmph over the speed limit.
Driving under the influence comes with a fine of Rs. 15,000 (currently Rs. 3,000) and a jail term of up to a year. But a second offence will lead to permanent loss of licence and up to two years in jail. The penalty is especially harsh for school bus drivers — Rs. 50,000 in fine and a three-year jail sentence.
Along with the fines and jail terms, drivers below 25 years stand to lose their licence for three months.
The punishment for jumping a red light is Rs. 5,000-15,000 in fine and one-month licence suspension. Similarly, you pay Rs. 5,000 for not wearing a seat belt.
India has one of the highest road fatalities in the world with 137,576 deaths reported last year. In the same period, Delhi recorded 7,566 accidents that killed 1,820 people. The bill aims to bring down such fatalities by 200,000 in the first five years and increase GDP by 4%.
Apart from the fines and imprisonment, motorists will be awarded penalty points for every traffic violation. Collecting 12 penalty points means losing your driving licence for a year.
The draft includes several new features in keeping with the times — fines for manufacturing faults, for instance, come in the wake of incidents of cars catching fire and vehicle recalls by auto firms.
“The bill, after it is cleared by cabinet, will be tabled in Parliament during the winter session. The proposed changes were long due as the last time the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 was amended was in 2001, and since then many provisions related to offences and penalty have ceased to have any punitive effect,” said a ministry official.
Our new act gives emphasis on E-governance to bring in transparency in the transport sector
— Nitin Gadkari (@nitin_gadkari) September 13, 2014
A Highway Traffic Regulation and Protection Force has been proposed while a motor accident fund would be set up to provide compulsory insurance to all road users. A pan-India road accident emergency access telephone number to alert and access emergency services is also in the works.

Brisk voting in 3 Lok Sabha  33 assembly seatsComments
Brisk voting was recorded in most of the 33 assembly seats and 3 Lok Sabha seats where bypolls were held on Saturday.
In Uttar Pradesh voting percentage was highest  in Mainpuri Lok Sabha constituency, which was vacated by Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh. Mulayam's grandnephew Tej Pratap Singh Yadav, 27, is contesting the seat on an SP ticket.
Among the voters was chief minister Akhilesh Yadav who landed in Saifai to cast his ballot.
Lack of enthusiasm was witnessed among the voters in the first two hours in all the constituencies, but slowly picked up later. By 3 pm around 44 % had cast their votes. Mild rains also affected the voter turnout.
The Mainpuri seat was held by SP, while all the eleven Assembly seats where voting is on were held by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
In West Bengal voting was brisk in Basirhat Dakshin while Chowringhee had lower voter turnout. Both the Left and the BJP accused the ruling TMC of terrorising voters, BJP's Basirhat candidate Samik Bhatatcharya said.
Over 62% polling was recorded in Basirhat Dakshin while nearly 40% voters exercised their franchise in Chowringhee  till 2 pm.
Voting was also brisk and peaceful in Telangana, Rajasthan and other states where bypolls are held.
Analysts are looking to see which way the wind blows in the bypolls spread across these nine states.
The results of two Lok Sabha seats — Vadodara which was vacated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Medak in Telangana was vacated by Telangana Rashtra Samithi chief and chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao — are unlikely to throw any surprises. But Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav’s prestige is at stake in his home turf Mainpuri, the third Lok Sabha seat.
The bypolls are being seen as an indicator of the popularity of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and opposition parties ahead of four assembly elections to be held this year.
They also pose a key question on the future of the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in Uttar Pradesh.
The BJP swept to power on the back of a so-called Modi wave this summer, but failed to maintain the momentum in last month’s by-elections in four states where it lost a majority of seats to the Congress party and its allies.
The BJP and its allies together won only eight of the 18 seats that went to the polls while the Congress and its allies won 10.
In the last Lok Sabha polls, a large number of OBCs and Dalits rallied behind the BJP across the Hindi belt. The shift dented the SP and BSP’s support base in the largest electoral state. The SP won just seven seats while Mayawati’s BSP drew a blank.
The grand alliance of the RJD-JDU-Congress could halt the BJP’s charge into this caste base. In the absence of such an alliance in Uttar Pradesh, any further losses may lead to an existential crisis for the two caste-based parties.
If the opposition parties — especially the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress in Rajasthan, Gujarat and Assam — can stop the BJP’s march, their claim about the Modi wave waning will receive a further boost.
With elections in Maharashtra and Haryana due next month, any by-election victory will also give the beleaguered Congress a fresh face saver after its humiliating Lok Sabha defeat.
But it may not be so easy for the opposition. Of the 33 seats, 11 are in Uttar Pradesh where the BJP swept 71 of 80 Lok Sabha seats.
In Gujarat and Rajasthan, where 13 assembly seats are up for grabs, the opposition could not even open its account in the general election.
Three seats are heading for the polls in Congress-ruled Assam where the BJP bagged 50% of Lok Sabha constituencies.
In West Bengal, the ruling Trinamool Congress will be desperate to win both seats as it wants to show that the Saradha scam has not hurt the party’s prospects.
For the BJP, a win or even a number two position in the results from Assam and Bengal will further cement its position as a fast emerging force, replacing traditional opposition parties like AGP and Left, respectively.
The by-elections in Chhattisgarh, Sikkim, Andhra and Tripura will test if the ruling parties can further consolidate their positions. Tripura is the only state where the Left is in power.

Outtakes: Sharon Lockhartcelebrity
Who is she?
American video artist, photographer and experimental filmmaker who has made four feature length and nearly as many short films since the late nineties. Lockhart additionally teaches art in California and does curatorial projects based on avant-garde cinema. Her work exemplifies a fine balance between formalist and anthropological modes of filmmaking.
What are her films about?
Themes
A Japanese high school basketball team, an audience in an opera theatre in the Amazon, a group of Japanese farmers at work and kids playing in industrial backyards in Poland form some of the subjects of Lockhart’s films. The virtual conversation between these alien cultures and the predominantly Western audience of these films is one of the central themes. Her ‘American’ films, set in factories and suburbs, look at the relationship between nature and man-made edifices and the individuals inhabiting them. Together, these films engage with and embody the idea of uneventful stretches of time, be it called leisure, boredom or recess.
Style
Lockhart’s method tries to crystallise the dialectic between her two fields of activity — photography and film. In her photographic work, she does this by shuffling the chronological order in which the photos were captured, so as to highlight the highly disjunctive nature of the enterprise. On the other hand, her films are made up of long and static shots that frame the subjects head-on and underline the fluid, time-bound quality of the cinematic medium, while also, with its theatrical boldness, suggesting that the photographic-filmic image hides as much as its shows.
Why is she of interest?
Like French documentarian Jean Rouch, Lockhart’s films, which deal with people from specific (at times, foreign) cultures, recognise the exoticism and exploitation that they risk. Her working method of participative ethnography, wherein the subjects become active participants in Lockhart’s work through performing for the camera as actors who are trained in situ, responds to the eternal dilemma of documentary filmmaking: how to film people without ‘using’ them?
Where to discover her?
The absorbing Lunch Break (2008) consists of a single tracking shot through the rusty corridor of factory in Maine, USA, during lunch time, slowed down digitally to 75 minutes. The superb, eye-deceiving visual patterns and aesthetic tension of the film never undermines its lyricism. It is in this all-too-short lunch break that the workers find a refuge from the grind of work, while the machines continue to drone.

All the worlds a producerUpdated: September 13, 2014 19:43 IST
All the world’s a producer
Sudhir Srinivasan
society
It’s about homosexuals. It’s in Hindi. And it is being financed through crowdfunding. As Chennai-based director Lokesh Kumar breaks all the rules with his first film, My Son is Gay, he has already raised Rs. 11 lakh in one month.
You are debuting with a film about a homosexual. You are raising money through crowdfunding. It’s all quite unusual.
I have always been interested in making films about social issues. Almost all the short films I have made have a message. I guess I got this idea from visiting a lot of film festivals in Bengaluru and Chennai. As for crowdfunding, I couldn’t imagine any producer wanting to fund a feature film about a homosexual. I had no choice really.
You didn’t even try to approach them?
No. I knew they’d expect a return on investment, and frankly, I’m not sure how the subject will be received by the audience. In a way, you could say I wasn’t confident enough to approach big producers.
Why homosexuality?
LGBT is a regular theme at most film festivals; I too was motivated to make a film about it. In addition, I was one of those uninformed people who was scared of homosexuals. I’ve grown out of it now.
You were scared of homosexuals? Why?
I guess you could attribute it to ignorance. I wasn’t even aware there existed a term called LGBT. I learnt much later about the many types of sexual orientations. I guess people are scared of what they don’t know enough about. My film will hopefully change that.
You are from Chennai, and you don’t talk Hindi yourself. Yet, you’re making the film in Hindi.
Most references to homosexuals in films, especially in Tamil, are either derogatory or comic. I don’t think the Tamil industry is primed for a film on such a taboo subject. Had I made it in Tamil, I doubt it would even get released. Hindi films seem to have the freedom to explore such topics. Hence, my decision to make it in Hindi.
Has bringing back Section 377 affected your film in any way?
Of course. I cannot hope to have a kissing scene approved by the censor board. That’s why I’m shooting two versions — one for the censor, and the other for the festival circuit. I trust the audience with accepting my film.
How has the public responded to your choice of subject?
It has been overwhelmingly positive. Of course, there are also those who wonder if I am homosexual, and if that’s why I’m making this film.
That’s like saying Mani Ratnam must be a child to make Anjali.
(Laughs) Exactly. Considering I’m a man, I guess I could never make a film about a woman, according to these people.
We understand that you shot part of the film with some initial funding from an NRI. It was only later that you opened it to crowdfunding?
Yes, we received about Rs. 4 lakh from an NRI indie film buff, Anil Saxena. That helped us shoot about 25 per cent of the film. I then realised that my short film aesthetics wouldn’t suit a feature film and that I would have to scale up on basic tools such as camera and lighting. We calculated that the least budget we could do a competent film with was Rs. 40 lakh. I then decided to opt for crowdfunding. After all, films such as Lucia had succeeded through this method.
How did you manage with just Rs. 40 lakh?
Some artistes such as Anupama Kumar (who plays the protagonist’s mother) and some members of the technical crew, like the cinematographer and editor, are doing it for free. It’s the same with my assistant directors. It’s due to such sacrifices that I’m confident of making this film on such a small budget.
You’re sourcing money through an Indian crowdfunding website.
Yes, it’s called www.fundmydream.in. We are its first client. In return, they receive 10 per cent of all contributions.
Considering your producers are benevolent people parting with hard-earned money, the responsibility must be crushing?
It is. But I also realise that these people desperately want to see a feature film about this pressing issue. I hope to start filming again by November, and release it by March — in time for Cannes.
Assuming the film manages to make a profit, do you plan to share the revenue with those who have helped finance it?
I don’t think people have donated to make a profit. They want to see this important film being made. They want to see homophobic minds being broken. If I make money from this film — a rather impossible outcome, I think — I’d want to first pay all those who worked for free.
Your Facebook page seems to have helped a lot.
Oh, it has! Believe it or not, I found almost all my technical crew there. I guess I’m one of the few people who has managed to use FB productively.

10 Things You Never Knew About Instant Ramenreddit
Everyone loves ramen these days. Classic ramen restaurants populate the country's biggest cities, and people love the instant stuff so much they have turned it into a hamburger bun, a lobster roll and even a burrito. We just can't get enough of the salty and addictive noodles .
And as we all learned in college, instant ramen noodles are there for you, waiting to be cooked and ready to be eaten in just five minutes. Here are 10 things you never knew about your favorite go-to food, even if you eat it every day.
1. The first instant ramen was considered a luxury item in supermarkets.
Although today it's considered a college staple and something you eat if you're broke, instant ramen used to be quite expensive in Japan . Momofuku Ando, the creator of Nissin ramen products, invented "Chicken Ramen," an instant snack that could be eaten easily and anywhere in 1958, when he noticed food was scarce after World War II. But when it arrived on Japanese supermarket shelves, it was seen as a very expensive product since fresh udon noodles sold for one-sixth the cost of "Chicken Ramen."
2. It's the best-selling item at Rikers prison.
The commissary at Rikers Island in New York needs to always make sure it is stocked up on Cup Noodles. It sells for 35 cents and, according to the New York Post , it's the most popular food item sold. Prison guards provide the prisoners with hot water to eat their beloved ramen. And sometimes, inmates discard the noodles and use the intense seasoning packets to flavor the bland prison cafeteria food.
3. Only the "Oriental" and "Chili" flavors of Nissin Top Ramen are vegetarian.
It may be hard to believe that the Nissin seasoning packets in the "Chicken," "Beef" and "Shrimp" flavors actually contain animal products, but they do . The "Chicken" flavor includes chicken fat and/or powder, the "Beef" flavor includes beef fat and/or powder and the "Shrimp" flavor includes shrimp powder. Remember: We're only talking about the Nissin brand, not Maruchan.
4. Some people (like David Chang) like to eat ramen without even cooking it.
Chang, founder of the Momofuku restaurant empire, explains in "Mind of a Chef," the appeal of biting into a chunk of uncooked ramen sprinkled with seasoning as an after-school snack:
"I think I was around eight years old. I'd come home from school and instead of having Hot Pockets and stuff, I had ramen. I didn't know it was bad for you to consume as a kid. I thought it was good for you."
5. Ramen is the Japanese word for Chinese "lo mein."
The Japanese owe it to the Chinese for the trendy food's name. According to "Being Japanese American," by Gil Asakawa , ramen is the Japanese pronunciation of the kanji characters for "lo mein" or "lau mein" in Chinese. However, there are competing theories, and other authors feel the most likely etymology is "lamian." Whichever is the case, it's no surprise that ramen is inspired by lo-mein, another boiled noodle dish invented centuries ago.
6. And China eats instant ramen more than any other country.
China's global demand for instant noodles is the highest, according to the World Instant Noodles Association (yes, that's a real thing). In 2013, China consumed more than 46 billion packets of ramen. Tong-Yi Instant Noodles, a popular Chinese brand, is sold almost everywhere, from Walmart to street stalls.
7. According to one survey, the Japanese consider ramen their best invention.
Aside from all the technology Japan has gifted the world, in 2000 the Fuji Research Institute stated that Japanese people are the proudest of introducing instant noodles to the world . They feel this way because instant noodles truly "represent 'Made in Japan,'" by not only being a national food but a global one.
8. It would cost you only about $140 a year if you ate ramen for every meal.
It's a fact that instant ramen is cheap. Maybe that's why businesses are considered "ramen-profitable" when they are taking in more money than they are spending . And since it usually costs the consumer about 13 cents a package (depending on where they live), it will only cost you $142.65 dollars a year if you decide to live off of it. To put this in perspective: The average American spends $7,852 on food a year .
9. There's a whole museum in Yokohama, Japan dedicated to Cup Noodles.
It's called the CupNoodles Museum , and it's dedicated to the history of the product and the mind of Momofuku Ando. The museum showcases a "My CUPNOODLES Factory," where visitors can make their own ramen concoctions and include cute customized naruto (fish cake) pieces with animals printed on them. The museum website states that there are 5,460 flavor combinations.
10. The first noodles ever consumed in space were instant ramen noodles.
Momofuku Ando wanted to make ramen portable and easy to eat not only on earth, but also in space, and he succeeded in 2005. Two years before he died, Ando created "Space Ram," a vacuum-packed ramen made with smaller noodles (so they can be cooked without using boiled water) and a thicker broth (to prevent dispersal). It was made for Japanese astronaut Soichi Noguchi's trip in the Discovery space shuttle.
Bonus: Justin Timberlake's hair in the '90s was an unintentional advertisement for instant ramen.
We hope this style comes back soon.

CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly identified the picture of the ramen at the museum as being at the Shin-Yokohama Raumen Museum in Osaka. It is, in fact, at the CUPNOODLES Museum in Yokohama. Maruchan's "Oriental" and "Chili" flavors of Top Ramen were also incorrectly described as vegetarian. Only Nissin's flavors are vegetarian. Maruchan's "Oriental" and "Chili" flavors are not. Language has also been amended to address competing theories on the etymology of "ramen."

Geoffrey s set to excite foodies with new Lebanese  Mexican additionsSaurav Bhanot        Edition: Sep 14, 2014
The flavours of the Veg Mezze platter were at par with any meat option you might have considered.
I've been eating at Geoffrey's for many years now. I have many fond memories of the place and have always had a wonderful time there. Though I have to admit, over the years my visits to the restaurant have drastically reduced. Not for any fault of the restaurant but simply because there are many newer options around!
Perhaps this was the exact thought in the minds of the team at Geoffrey's when they decided to introduce Mexican and Lebanese food as part of its menu. Risky, yes. Effective, yes too!
My meal began with the Lebanese platter, that's obviously non-vegetarian and the Veg Mezze platter. And both were equally good. I especially enjoyed the Veg Mezze one; the flavours were at par with any meat option you might have considered.
Next in line were the Chicken Burritos and Shish Taouk. Those who have been fans of burritos and have tried the dish at every possible opportunity might be left a little underwhelmed with this one - it isn't bad; it is just not great! The Shish Taouk however is fantastic! Grilled just right, you won't be able to stop yourself from falling in love with it. There was also a Pollo ala Crema pasta which wasn't bad either - just that I was too busy savouring the dishes before to care much for it in any way!
I honestly had no great expectations from desserts here. Death by Chocolate isn't a unique concept after all. But if unique is what you're looking for, give the Sizzling Brownie a shot. It's a brownie served as a sizzler, yes! The chocolate is cold, the brownie is 'sizzling hot' and the taste is marvelous. Whoever came up with this idea is a sure shot genius!
Did the new menu additions give me reasons enough to go back to this once oft-visited restaurant? For sure. Those who thought Geoffrey's had given up, watch out - their game isn't over yet!

Coal scam: Apex court refuses to hear pleas of companiesCoal scam: Apex court refuses to hear pleas of companies
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Sept 12:  
The Supreme Court today refused to give any further hearing on the pleas of companies which were illegally allocated coal blocks by the Government.
A bench headed by Chief Justice R M Lodha turned down the pleas of power generating companies that they should be re-heard in case the apex court decides to cancel the allotments.
The bench has already reserved its order on the fate of 218 coal blocks allocations which were declared by it as illegal and arbitrary.
The apex court had on September 9 reserved its order after the Centre advocated their cancellation while the allottees blamed the Government for irregularities and demanded setting up of a committee to go into each of the allocations.
The Coal Producers’ Association, the Sponge Iron Manufacturers’ Association and the Independent Power Producers’ Association of India and some private entities had opposed the stand of the Government for not favouring the constitution of any committee to look into the consequences of the August 25 judgement of apex court.
They had deprecated the Centre’s stand that “cancellation of coal block allocation is a natural consequence of the judgement” by saying that it would lead to total disaster and ultimate suffering for the man on street and the rural population, already facing a power crisis.
The bench had, however, said, “the Government is only articulating its position” and it would “not be a fair way” of dealing with the matter as “screening committee meetings speak for themselves that no procedure was followed”.

Our Bureau
VS Sampath
New Delhi, September 12:  
Maharashtra and Haryana will hold polls on October 15 to elect new Assemblies. Counting of votes will take place on October 19, Chief Election Commissioner VS Sampath said on Friday. An electorate of 1.6 crore in Haryana and 8.4 crore in Maharashtra will be eligible to vote.
The by-elections for Beed Parliamentary constituency in Maharashtra and Kandhamal in Odisha and one Assembly constituency each in Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Nagaland, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh will be held along with the Assembly polls in Maharashtra and Haryana.
The death of Gopinath Munde, Union Rural Development Minister, in a road accident here in August has necessitated the by-poll in Beed .
Asked when polls to the Assembly in Jammu and Kashmir would be held, Sampath said: “We are watching the situation closely. After things come into shape (a) decision will be taken.” He pointed out that the term of the Jharkhand and J&K Assemblies expires only in January 2015.
The Model Code of Conduct, which prevents the State government from making any announcements of new projects, concessions and so on, comes into effect immediately in Maharashtra and Haryana. Even the Centre cannot announce key decisions that can have implications for the States going to polls.

West Bengal Govt to transfer its stake in Haldia Petrochem to TCG

The naphtha cracker unit of Haldia Petrochemicals
Kolkata, Sept 13:  
The West Bengal Government has decided to transfer its shareholding in favour of Purnendu Chatterjee’s TCG, which was also a major shareholder in troubled Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd (HPL).
Sources close to the development told PTI that the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) would transfer its block of around 40 per cent to TCG at Rs 25.10 a piece, a price which was offered by state-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) when the Government had invited EoIs last year.
Although IOC turned out to be the sole valid bidder, the transaction fell through as TCG moved court over the controversial 155 million shares block which WBIDC claimed was owned by it.
Later, IOC withdrew from the transaction process. The PSU was having around nine per cent stake in HPL.
The plant, located at Haldia, had been shut for more than two months with authorities citing reasons of a technical snag.
Asked about the possible outcome of the deal, one of the members of the lenders’ consortium to HPL said that with both the warring promoters smoking the peace pipe, this would augur well for the future of the company.
“The company had approached the lenders for additional infusion of funds which would now be forthcoming as the ownership issue will get resolved”, the banker said.
The company had long been facing fund crunch and was operating the plant at sub-optimal capacity owing to non-availability of naphtha in desired amount.

100 days of Sikka: Infy stock up 16.12% in three monthsInfosys
(What goes in Sikka's favour…)
When its founder NR Narayana Murthy returned to revive plunging profits and dampened spirits in 2013, Infosys was debunked as a 'family business' by many. Little did its critics know, that in less than a year's time, Infosys would witness a massive change and will begin charting a new course under its first ever non-founder CEO. The appointment and anointment of Vishal Sikka, formally working with SAP, was heralded as the arrival of a much-needed change that Infosys needed - both in its thinking and ideology.
It's been three months since Infosys named Vishal Sikka as its first non-founder CEO although he formally took charge only on August 1. Since the announcement on June 12, Sikka's approval rating on the stock market has been on a steady climb gaining as much as 16.12%. While most other IT companies have also seen a similar rise during this period, what marks in his favour is the contrast in performance of Infosys stock three months prior to the announcement when it reported a 0.51% fall while most peers moved up. We take a look at the charts:

Gujarat bypolls: 40% voter turnout till 3PMThe polling day also witnessed some controversies as complaints of poll code violation were filed against some of the Congress candidates. (Source: PTI)
Press Trust of India | Ahmedabad | Posted: September 13, 2014 5:55 pm | Updated: September 13, 2014 6:06 pm
Around 40 per cent voter turnout was reported till 3 PM in Gujarat, where bypolls are being held today in one Lok Sabha constituency, vacated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and nine Assembly seats.
After a slow start, polling picked up some steam as the day progressed. “Gujarat has recorded 39.50 per cent voter turnout till 3 PM,” a statement from the Election Commission said.
Vadodara Lok Sabha seat, vacated by Modi who retained Varanasi, recorded 33.41 per cent polling till 3 PM. Limkheda Assembly constituency, which falls under the tribal district of Dahod, witnessed highest turnout of 58.23 per cent. The high-profile Maninagar seat in Ahmedabad, represented by Modi when he was Chief Minister, registered the lowest polling at 27.08 per cent.
The turnout in other Assembly seats was: Deesa (51.29%), Tankara (51.49%), Khambhalia (44.68%), Mangrol (46.06%), Anand (46.73%), Matar (40.78%) and Talaja (39.27%).
The polling day also witnessed some controversies as complaints of poll code violation were filed against some of the Congress candidates.
BJP has filed complaints with EC against Congress candidates Jatin Kella (Maninagar) and Kanti Sodha (Anand) for allegedly violating poll code by wearing scarfs with Congress’ election symbol on them when they went to cast their votes.
BJP has sought legal action against both candidates, the party’s state unit spokesperson Harshad Patel said. Congress candidate from Vadodara Narendra Ravat sparked a controversy by clicking a selfie outside a polling booth, where he cast his vote, displaying the party symbol. He took the picture of his ink-marked finger.
The Assembly bye-elections were necessitated due toresignation of sitting BJP MLAs from their respective constituencies after they won the Lok Sabha polls.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a meeting with the Honda Motor Company chairman Fumihiko Ike in New Delhi on Thursday.
Global carmakers, including Honda and General Motors (GM), said on Friday that the government should make its policies more business friendly if the country wants to succeed in Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's 'Make In India' mission. They highlighted a host of obstacles such as difficulty in getting business permits, complex tax structure, poor infrastructure and logistics which are holding back growth of the auto industry.
"There are a considerable number of obstacles to doing business in this country. It is hoped that such obstacles will be cleared away under the new leadership of Prime Minister Modi," chairman of Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association and Honda Motor Company Fumihiko Ike said at the annual convention of Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.
Many Japanese auto parts suppliers were keen to establish operations in this country, Ike further said. However, these suppliers as well as auto manufacturers often encounter problems in obtaining business permits and completing paperwork required for acquisition of the business property, he lamented.
The complicated process of obtaining a plant construction permit in some cases has seriously hindered business plans, Ike added. These problems are further compounded by India's complex domestic taxation system, which varies from one state to other. These taxes, which are far more burdensome than international taxations standards, are also impending investment in India, Ike further added. Nissan senior vice-president and chairman for Africa, Middle East and India Takashi Hata said, "India must also modernise its creaking rail, port, road and other infrastructure and ease bureaucratic red tape.
Logistics and infrastructure are a clear disadvantage of the country." General Motors executive vicepresident Stefan Jacoby also said that to realise the full potential of the industry, "we would like the government to reform overall Central and state taxation policies in a timely manner".

Keep the door ajar to achieve whatever is possible:PakistanPrint
PTI | New Delhi | Posted: September 13, 2014 6:29 pm
Pakistan on Saturday made a strong pitch for normalisation of ties with India after last month’s “political setback” and said in diplomacy one should keep or leave the “door ajar” so that whatever was possible could be achieved.
The remarks were made by Pakistan High Commissioner Abdul Basit here, days after External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said there was no “full stop” in diplomacy while replying on the future strategy towards talks with Pakistan.
Addressing a meet of businessmen from India and Pakistan, Basit also talked about his meeting with India’s National Security Advisor Ajit Doval earlier in the day and said both agreed that destinies of both the nations are inter-linked and there was a need to move forward.
“We both agreed that the time has now come to get out of this pattern (taking a step forward and two steps ackward) and to have a new narrative which helps our two countries to keep moving forward. That is easier said than done,” Basit said at the meet, held on the margins of Pakistan trade fair here.
“Unfortunately, there has been a setback last month. I would say political setback. But that should not in any manner deter us from continuing with our efforts and I am confident that things will come back on track,” Basit said.
The Pakistan top envoy said there are complex problems between both the countries but, irrespective of that, India and Pakistan should move forward.
“We understand that the complex problems would not go away. They will be there. On certain issues, we will have agreements or compromise quickly but on other issues we will perhaps have to wait longer. But important is to keep moving forward and we hope that this trend will continue in days, months and years ahead,” he added.
Welcoming Swaraj’s remarks, the Pakistan’s top envoy said, “In diplomacy, you keep or leave a door ajar. So, that whatever is possible, that is achieved.”
Basit said where diplomats have failed, business community on both sides have come a long way in bringing the two countries together.
“We hope that we (diplomats) would be able to follow your (businessmen) footsteps and try to build on the work which you people on both sides have been doing.
“It is a very complex relationship. It is not a linear relationship. It has many ups and downs. We take a step forward and two steps backward. This has been the pattern for the last 67 years,” he said.
India had called off the talks between the two Foreign Secretaries scheduled to be held in Islamabad on August 25, telling Pakistan bluntly to choose between an Indo-Pak dialogue or hobnobbing with the separatists.
Ahead of Islamabad meet, Basit had invited Kashmiri separatists here for consultations.

Residents allege flouting of norms
Residents of Ponniamman Koil Street, Kotturpuram, are at their wit’s end figuring out how to deal with a problem allegedly caused by a non-vegetarian fast-food outlet.
“ The eatery does not comply with fire-safety norms. It doesn’t have a chimney and an exhaust fan. In this regard, we have submitted petitions to the Commissioner and the Health Officer, Chennai Corporation, to take necessary action,” residents reported.
It is reported that acting on the petitions, the Commissioner and the Health Officer issued notices’ to the eatery owner asking him to fix a chimney, set up an exhaust fan and to comply with other fire-safety regulations. However, residents allege, that he has not taken any steps so far to meet these requirements.
The eatery is also said to have taken up the road space and is open till midnight. Customers at the outlet consume liquor in the open and cause nuisance to passers-by, residents allege. The leftovers are dumped on the road. Residents further add that repeated complaints to the authorities concerned from 2011 have not yielded any results.
This May, residents again submitted petitions to the outlet owner, the Commissioner, the Assistant Engineer, Zone 13, the Revenue Officer, and the Health Officer, Chennai Corporation, and the Chairman, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board.
“The respite came in July when TNPCB issued directives to the Chennai Corporation to take further action. But till date, no action has been taken by the civic body,” the residents complained.
Official sources in the Chennai Corporation say they will look into the TNPCB notice and sort out the issue.

All-party meet pledges to rebuild flood-ravaged Statepolitical parties
PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti, Congress leader Saifuddin Soz and BJP’s Jugal Kishore were among those who attended the meeting convened by Chief Minister Omar Abdullah.
Pledging to rebuild the lives and livelihood in flood—hit Jammu and Kashmir, political parties on Saturday came together to issue a joint appeal to individuals and organisations within and outside the State to help affected people in “every possible way“.
A resolution was passed at an all—party meeting, convened by Chief Minister Omar Abdullah to deliberate over flood crisis response, which expressed complete solidarity with the affected people and firmly resolved to rebuild the lives, livelihoods, private properties and public infrastructure.
PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti, Congress leader Saifuddin Soz and BJP’s Jugal Kishore were among those who attended the meeting.
The political parties appealed to all individuals and organisations within and outside the state to come forward to help the people of the state in every possible way, it said while appreciating the contribution of civil society bodies, NGOs, self—help groups, individuals and other stake—holders.
It also conveyed appreciation for the support given to the state in the hour of crisis by the government of India and its agencies, including army, air force and NDRF.
The all—party meeting expressed deep condolence over the loss of precious lives in the unprecedented floods which struck the state, the resolution said.
All political parties expressed deep sympathies with those injured and displaced and those who suffered on account of the calamity.
After the meeting, Abdullah said all parties were supportive of the rescue and relief operations. He appreciated the fact that the parties came together and sent out a joint message.
“If NC and PDP can sit together and send out a joint message, if BJP and Congress can sit together and send out a joint message, rest of the people too can join hands in this hour of crisis,” he told PTI.
He said several good suggestions were made by different parties.
Main opposition PDP presented a 10—point programme.
Mehbooba said this is “no time to do politics” and first priority is rescue and rebuild. “Everyone, the rich and the poor have been affected.”
She said there should be a joint appeal at national and international level for whatever help can be provided.
One of the suggestions was that all MPs should contribute five per cent of MPLAD funds for reconstruction of the State.

Strong solar flare making its way towards Earth
AP
Tweet
AP This Jan. 22, 2012 file picture shows a solar flare erupting on the Sun's northeastern hemisphere. A solar storm moving at a speed of 2.5 million mph could arrive early Friday, scientists from the Weather Prediction Centre in Boulder, Colorado have predicted.

The storm is moving medium fast, about 2.5 million mph (4.02 million kph), meaning the soonest it could arrive is early Friday
A strong solar flare is blasting its way to Earth, but the worst of its power looks like it will barely skim above the planet and not cause many problems.
It has been several years since Earth has had a solar storm of this size coming from sunspots smack in the middle of the sun, said Tom Berger, director of the Space Weather Prediction Centre in Boulder, Colorado, U.S.. The flare on the sun barely hits the “extreme” on forecasters’ scale, but with its worst effects missing Earth it is only looking “potentially strong” at most when it arrives at Earth as a solar storm, he said.
So while the power grid may see fluctuations because the storm will cause changes in Earth’s magnetic field, it won’t knock power systems off line, Mr. Berger said. It may cause slight disturbances in satellites and radio transmissions but nothing major.
The storm is moving medium fast, about 2.5 million mph (4.02 million km/hr), meaning the soonest it could arrive is early Friday. But it could be later, Mr. Berger said.

Goldman Sachs cuts JP Associates target price by 55%
Target price slashed because of concerns over coal supply and slow growth in cement volumes
Brokerage firm Goldman Sachs has cut JP Associates’ target price by about 55 per cent in the near term, thanks to concerns over coal supply and slow growth in cement volumes. The brokerage has brought its 12-month target price for JP Associates to Rs 37 from Rs 84 earlier, it said in a note to clients. The trigger, was the sharp fall in the stock price after a 1.45 per cent stake-sale by the group company Jaypee Infra Ventures, through block trades between September 1 and 3.
Since September 1, the stock has fallen 26 per cent. The stock is currently trading down about three per cent from Thursday’s close at Rs 35.50. “Uncertainty also exists on fuel for its cement and power businesses, pending the Supreme Court’s decision on coal block allocation,” said the note authored by analysts Pulkit Patni and Mohit Soni.
Goldman had upgraded the company’s stock in June. But since the upgrade on June 20, the share price of JP Associates has fallen 49 per cent, while the benchmark Sensex has risen nine per cent.

Pistorius Negligent But Not Guily Of Homocide:Sadly Im Not Shockedreddit
The latest shocking development in the conversation surrounding domestic violence comes at the hands of a South African judge who found Olympic athlete Oscar Pistorius "negligent," but not guilty of murder in the Valentine's Day 2013 shooting of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. Today's final verdict of "culpable homicide" is a charge equivalent to manslaughter. He "acted hastily," the judge ruled, but he did not mean to kill Steenkamp when he shot her four times through a closed bathroom door in his Johannesburg home. Sentencing will come later, but though it is likely Pistorius will face some jail time, the key word here is some. "Culpable homicide" in South Africa carries a maximum of 15 years, though it could be far less.
Is anyone shocked? "
Sadly, I can't say I am. This decision reflects a culture-wide challenge to hold accountable abusers and others who perpetrate domestic violence. In finding that there were not "enough facts to support a murder charge," the judge basically put girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp at fault for being at the wrong place at the wrong time. In this case, the "wrong place" was the other side of Pistorius's bathroom door, through which Pistorius "blindly" fired four shots, believing it was an intruder, and not the woman who very often shared the apartment and who, earlier that night, had retreated into the bathroom during an argument. He used a 9mm pistol that he kept under his bed.
There were holes in his story. There were the neighbors who heard screams. The series of texts between Pistorius and Steenkamp that revealed he often "picked on" her and that she scared him "and how u snap at me," she wrote. (Still, like many women in an abusive relationship, she apologized for her part.) What's more, Pistorius is a double amputee. He claimed to have been woken up by noise coming from the bathroom, which would have meant he was not wearing his prosthetics. Ballistics, however, showed that the shots came from above. He says he took Steenkamp to be an intruder--and yet had ample opportunity to call out to her or, say, check the bed beside him to see if she was there, as he walked the 16 feet from the bed to the bathroom door. Instead, he shot.
Should we be surprised Pistorius was not convicted of the greater crime? Hardly--that seems to be the pattern with domestic abusers, and especially celebrity ones. Look at O.J. Simpson. Ray Rice. As one Guardian writer notes, the Pistorius trial attracted more attention than Mandela's funeral.
Even if Steenkamp's killing was not pre-meditated--even if it was, rather, a serious mistake, double emphasis on the "if"--it is a mistake that reflects a culture of violence, a tendency to resort to attack first, think later. This is a culture that will not change until we begin to hold abusers accountable, even for their "mistakes." And even if they are celebrities. Indeed, the verdict comes as Janay Palmer Rice stands by her husband, former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice, and talks about "her part" in the elevator punch that has since gotten Ray Rice fired. I wish I could say that was shocking, too, but it's sadly, these days, something closer to the norm.

Amid Alibaba fever, reasons for caution in global IPO market
The highly anticipated debut of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, the Chinese e-commerce group, will come amid the busiest year for initial public offerings (IPOs) since the technology bubble burst in 2000.Alibaba's IPO, which could come as soon as September 19, could raise at least   $21 billion and claim Facebook Inc's title of biggest tech IPO. It will usher in a fall season when plenty of new names sell shares for the first time in the US market.Returns from IPOs so far this year have been mixed. S
The highly anticipated debut of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, the Chinese e-commerce group, will come amid the busiest year for initial public offerings (IPOs) since the technology bubble burst in 2000.
Alibaba's IPO, which could come as soon as September 19, could raise at least $21 billion and claim Facebook Inc's title of biggest tech IPO. It will usher in a fall season when plenty of new names sell shares for the first time in the US market.
Returns from IPOs so far this year have been mixed. Some analysts say large swaths of the market, especially biotechnology stocks, are frothy.
The percentage of IPOs coming from money-losing companies has jumped to a 14-year high, according to Jay Ritter, a professor of finance and leading scholar of IPOs at the University of Florida.
The mixed financial results could dim enthusiasm for some of the hot names coming later this year, including web hosting company GoDaddy, airline Virgin America, and possibly burger chain Shake Shack, which has been exploring an IPO.
Roughly one-third of the 188 stocks that debuted this year are selling below their IPO price. New stocks have risen an average of 19 per cent over the first three months of trading, compared with 36 per cent in 2013, and 23 per cent in 2012, according to research firm Dealogic in New York.
"With the exception of mature companies like Alibaba, a lot of the companies that have all the hype around them tend to underperform beyond the first day. They just get squeezed to valuations that are beyond what they can absorb," said Kathleen Smith, who manages Greenwich, Connecticut-based Renaissance Capital's IPO ETF.
MediWound Ltd, a biopharmaceutical company, serves as a cautionary tale. Its shares down 60 per cent from the first closing price.
In perhaps the year's biggest flop, shares of King Digital Entertainment Plc, the maker of mobile game "Candy Crush Saga," have tumbled more than 29 percent since going public in March.
"Remember how a few years ago, everyone had Angry Birds? That seems so 1998 now. These things run on a life cycle, and you need new things in the content pipeline all the time," said Jim O'Donnell, chief investment officer at San Francisco-based Forward, which has $5 billion in assets under management.
Some of the IPOs from late last year, including casual dining chain Potbelly Corp, have also sunk. Potbelly is down 60 per cent from its first-day close.
Given the underwhelming performance of several high-profile IPOs in recent months, some analysts worry investor appetite for risk is reaching unsustainable levels.
Much of the influx of money-losing companies comes from one sector, biotechnology, where investors tolerate spotty track records in hopes of cashing in on lucrative payouts.
While some investors find their bets rewarded, as in the case of UltraGenyx Pharmaceutical Inc, which is up 176 per cent from its IPO price, others are disappointed. Three of the five worst performing IPOs of 2014 are in biotechnology.
"They're essentially looking at companies that don't have much in the way of revenue or profit and hoping to see that one big blockbuster drug approval or pharma company buyout," said Jeff Reeves, editor of InvestorPlace.com in Rockville, Maryland.
Yet even excluding biotech, IPOs look rich. Offer prices have been about 50 per cent higher this year than the average from 2001 to 2013, even as median sales declined to $136.2 million from $187.3 million in the year before the companies go public, according to Ritter.
Experts say the stock market's gains, with the S&P 500 topping 2,000 for the first time last month, are somewhat responsible for the appetite for risk. And with the US Federal Reserve keeping rates low, investors seeking growth are attracted to more untested companies.
"Individual investors' appetite for risk will be predicated on the economic backdrop. If they think the Fed will continue to be accommodating, they'll be more apt to want to take risks on IPOs," said Joel Guth, chief executive officer of Gryphon Financial Partners, a member of the HighTower Network.
Still, there are some indications investors are becoming cautious. In the second quarter, stocks rose an average of 9.2 per cent on their first day of trading. In each of the three quarters before that, stocks popped about 20 per cent.
That could mean the torrent of companies slated for IPOS in the next few months, like restaurant-arcade chain Dave & Buster's Entertainment and peer-to-peer banker LendingClub, will be met with more skepticism.
"When valuations are at their highest level in years, at some point, there's going to be a correction," Ritter said.

Insurers meet Parliament select panelPress Trust of India |  New Delhi Sep 12, 2014

Insurers meet Parliament select panel
It was the second meeting of the panel. It would meet again on Sept 19 and 26 to expedite firming up report
Moving expeditiously on the controversial Insurance Bill, the Parliament’s select committee on Friday heard views of LIC and other public sector insurers, and decided to meet every Friday to fast-track the scrutiny report.
“Secretaries in the different departments of the government and representatives of insurance companies made representations before the committee,” sources said.
They further said the views of different parties on the key economic Bill would be known only during the discussion after stakeholder consultations.
It was the second meeting of the panel. It would meet again on September 19 and 26 to expedite firming up report.
After first meeting of the panel earlier this month, committee chairman Chandan Mitra had said: "We will try to submit our report on the Insurance Bill by the third week of November".
The 15-member panel headed by the senior BJP leader also recorded "oral evidence" of representatives of General Insurance Council, a body set up by insurance regulator IRDA.
Besides, top officials of ministries of Corporate Affairs, Finance, Law and Justice Ministry and Commerce presented their views on the bill.
The bill, which proposes to hike the FDI limit in the insurance sector to 49 per cent, has been caught in a logjam with the Congress-led opposition insisting that it be referred to a select committee.
Bowing to opposition pressure, the government had agreed to refer the controversial bill to the committee.
The committee members would also be visiting Mumbai and Chennai to meet stakeholders to understand and record their views on the Bill.
The members of the committee are Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Jagat Prakash Nadda (all BJP), Anand Sharma, B K Hariprasad and JD Seelam (all Cong), Satish Chandra Misra (BSP), K C Tyagi (JD-U), Derek O'Brien (TMC), V Maitreyan (AIADMK), Naresh Gujral (SAD), Ram Gopal Yadav (SP), Kalpataru Das (BJD), P Rajiv (CPI-M) and Rajiv Chandrasekhar (Ind).
The Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill 2008 seeks to amend the Insurance Act, 1938, the General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Act, 1972 and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority Act, 1999.

Inflation trajectory does not match the slump in demand, prolonged pause on rates likely
The macroeconomic data releases on Friday — inflation and industrial production — suggest the structural imbalances in the economy have not been eliminated. Industrial production growth as measured by the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) slumped to 0.5 per cent in July from 3.4 per cent in the previous month. While economists were expecting industrial output to decline, the July figure is well below the Street’s estimate of two per cent.
Consumer Price Index (CPI)-based inflation in August also gives little comfort, as it eased to 7.8 per cent, a tad below the previous month’s 7.96 per cent. While CPI-based inflation continues to be marginally below the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)’s target of eight per cent in 2015, economists believe inflation is still high, given the current environment. Dhananjay Sinha, economist and strategist at Emkay Global, says: “The data do not reflect that there is an inflection yet and that RBI will hold on. For the current level of growth, the inflation is very high. Lower growth and poor demand should reflect in prices but that is not happened. There is no comfort on inflation yet and the central bank is unlikely to ease.” The buoyancy seen in industrial output in the first quarter of FY15 was largely due to higher consumption followed by excise duty cuts and higher government spending. Also, export orders contributed but with these moderating, the second quarter output is expected to remain between 1.75 per cent and two per cent.
Clustering of demand and excise duty cut led to demand improvement in consumer demand but industrial data for July shows consumer durable growth continues to be weak. The positive surprise witnessed in the first quarter is unlikely to persist. Consequently, economic growth is expected to remain in the range of 5.2-5.5 per cent and not inch closer to six per cent.
The inflation print continues to look worrying. In August, a large part of the rise in prices has been driven by a 16.8 per cent increase in vegetable prices. Though core inflation has declined to 6.9 per cent from 7.1 per cent, it is evident food prices will continue to be a problem for the government. So far, there is no evidence of the government coming up with a solution to tame this. For now, RBI will continue to hold rates, till there is greater comfort on prices.

Sun Pharma: Is the Street s nervousness justifiedUjjval Jauhari |  Sep 12, 2014

Sun Pharma: Is the Street's nervousness justified?
The impact of Taro's recalled products is not much but any adverse regulatory action on the Halol plant will hurt
Sun Pharmaceutical Industries' stock, which lost 4.2 per cent on Thursday following the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s surprise inspection at its Halol plant in Gujarat, fell another two per cent on Friday, upon its US subsidiary, Taro, recalling a product. Two lots of anti-clot drug Warfarin, which contributes five per cent to Taro's sales and one per cent to Sun's overall sales, according to analysts, have been recalled.
The stock's fall is understandable, looking at the severe implications that FDA's negative observations have had on the US business of Indian pharma majors such as Wockhardt or Ranbaxy. The question is, whether Sun Pharma will meet with the same fate?
Earlier this year, Sun had also received negative observations for its Kharkadi unit and had to stop export to the US. Although the unit wasn't a major contributor to its US sales, the Halol plant is. Analysts estimate the unit to be contributing 40 per cent to Sun's US sales and 25 per cent to consolidated profits. The concerns are also raised as this inspection is believed to be, on the back of products recalled of late.
The three important medicines recalled from the US market are 40,000 bottles of anti-depressant Venlafaxine Hydrochloride extended-release generic tablets after it failed dissolution test, anti-cancer Gemcitabine because of sterility assurance and anti-diabetic Metformin for packaging problems (Gabapentin tabs found in Metformin bottles). While all recalls were limited to specific batches, all three products are manufactured at Halol, says Sarabjit Kour Nangra at Angel Broking, who feels in case of any adverse impact the stock could witness a dip of about 15 per cent.
However, product recalls and taking corrective measures is a routine process followed by most companies catering to the US market. Also, inspections, too, take place (Halol was inspected in 2012) and hence, till the FDA doesn't find any violation of good manufacturing practices, there is not much to worry. Therefore, investors should await clarity on the issues, which should come by next week. If no negatives are there in the observations, the correction will be a good opportunity to enter the stock.
For now, Sun's growth prospects remain strong. Its products in the US are doing well because sales continue to be driven by acquired companies such as Taro, DUSA and URL Pharma. It is also in the process of completing the acquisition of Ranbaxy. The acquisition on completion will be earnings-accretive for Sun, as analysts see it monetising the exclusive launch opportunities of certain generics Ranbaxy has been unable to do, as well as future launches. Analysts at Credit Suisse had increased their target price to Rs 950 on September 8. They remain positive on Sun, with visibility on growth increasing after the Ranbaxy acquisition, Gleevec settlement (with Novartis paving way for US launch), and the Taro price increase. While consensus target price is Rs 865, most analysts who have rated the stock in the past two days remain bullish, with the target price close to current levels.

West Bengal to transfer its shares in Haldia Petrochemicals to TCGPress Trust of India |  Kolkata Sep 13, 2014

West Bengal to transfer its shares in Haldia Petrochemicals to TCG
The West Bengal government has decided to transfer its shareholding in favour of Purnendu Chatterjee's TCG, which was also a major shareholder in troubled Haldia Petrochemicals Limited (HPL).
The West Bengal government has decided to transfer its shareholding in favour of Purnendu Chatterjee's TCG, which was also a major shareholder in troubled Haldia Petrochemicals Limited (HPL).
Sources close to the development told PTI that West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) would transfer its block of around 40% to TCG at a price of Rs 25.10 a piece, a price which was offered by state-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) when the government invited expression of interest (EoI) last year.
Although IOC turned out to be the sole valid bidder in the auction, the transaction fell through as TCG moved the court over the controversial 155 million shares block which WBIDC claimed was owned by it.
Later, IOC withdrew from the transaction process. The PSU had around 9% stake in HPL.
The plant, located at Haldia, had been shut for more than two months with authorities citing a technical snag.
A member of the lenders' consortium to HPL said with both the warring promoters smoking the peace pipe, this would augur well for the future of the company.
"The company had approached the lenders for additional infusion of funds which would now be forthcoming as the ownership issue will get resolved", the banker said.
The company had long been facing a fund crunch and was operating the plant at sub-optimal capacity owing to non-availability of naphtha in the desired amount.

BSNL to offer free calls for a week in Kashmir
Except Poonch, mobile services are either substantially or partially restored in all parts of the valley
State-run BSNL will offer free calls on its network for a week in the flood hit Kashmir, while private mobile players will offer 60 minutes a day of free airtime in the valley.
Communications and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Saturday said mobile networks have been substantially or partially restored in the valley, except Poonch.
Of the total 12,306 base transceiver stations (BTS) or mobile towers in Jammu and Kashmir, 6,811 were submerged and out of that, the government has restored 1,208 BTS..
"People can talk free for a week on BSNL's network in the flood affected areas. We have also requested private telecom operators. They have allowed 60 minutes of free talk time every day," Prasad said during his 100 days conference on IT and Telecom.
Also, 8,000 landline connections in the Kashmir valley have started working and the government has started five free PCOs and Wifi spots at the Srinagar airport.
"Except Poonch, mobile services are either substantially or partially restored in all parts of the valley."
BSNL had earlier said telecom services in the area will be normalised soon. BSNL had restored 92 mobile towers, which were affected by floods. Overall 473 towers are working in the region, out of total 934 towers. Other mobile operators including Airtel, Vodafone, Idea Cellular, Aircel and Reliance Communications (RCom) have also restored their network in various parts of the state.

All three investors might have equal shareholding in Shriram CapitalBS Reporter |  Chennai Sep 13, 2014

All 3 investors to have equal shareholding in Shriram Capital, says Thyagarajan
Thyagarajn refused to comment anything related to Piramal taking over as the Chairman
Shriram Group Chairman R Thyagarajan has said, in less than two years, the promoter entity (of Shriram Capital), Piramal and South African financial conglomerate Sanlam will have equal stakes in Shriram Capital -- the holding company of the Rs 60,000-crore financial services businesses of Shriram Group.
Speaking to reporters in the sidelines of a conference on GM Technology - Myth and Reality, organised by Industrial Economist and Agriculture Consultancy Management Foundation, he said, “Our aim is all the three groups (Shriram Ownership Trust, Piramal and Sanlam) should have equal shareholding in the company, eventually. I am talking about the financial services arm and not the non-financial services businesses.”
The promoters of Shriram envisage a three-way partnership between themselves, Piramal Enterprises and Sanlam. Shriram Capital is the group’s holding company, which runs the insurance and financial services businesses.
The Piramal group has earlier bought around 20 per cent stake in Shriram Capital for Rs 2,014 crore and later 10 per cent stake in Shriram City Union Finance. In May, 2013, the Piramal group has bought 9.9 per cent stake in Shriram Transport Finance for Rs 1,652 crore. According to reports,  Ajay Piramal would be taken over as the chairman of Shriram Capital and a formal announcement would come out anytime now.
Thyagarajn refused to comment anything related to Piramal taking over as the chairman.
The Piramal group has also expressed their idea of staying for a long-term partnership. On long-term partnership with the Shriram Group, he said, “Marriages in India are forever, they do not come with exit clauses."
Shriram Group has earlier said the partnership would help Shriram Capital to strengthen its financial services business. According to reports in April this year, promoters of Shriram Ownership Trust has diluted 10 per cent stake apart from issuing fresh capital amounting to 10 per cent to the Piramal group. With this, Shriram Ownership Trust has 47 per cent stake, declining from 64 per cent, while Sanlam has 23 per cent stake in Shriram Capital.
Thyagarajan has earlier also said the idea is to create an entity where all the three partners have equal stakes. "We believe that partnerships should be equal and over time, all three partners will have equal stakes," he had said. However, he refused to reveal more on the plans.
Sanlam has also expressed its interest to increase stake in the company, though there were some regulatory hurdles in doing so. Shriram Capital's operating entities have 53,000 employees across 2,600 offices and a net profit of Rs 800 crore with assets under management of  Rs 78,000 crore, in April this year.

Milan, Sept 13:  
The European Union (EU) is seeking ways to marshal billions of euros into its sluggish economy without getting deeper into debt, casting the net wide to consider options from a pan-European capital market to a huge investment fund.
But the debate at a two-day meeting of EU finance ministers in Milan was clouded by harsh criticism for France for failing to meet a deadline to put its finances in order.

MPs can launch legal action against Vinod Rai : CongBS Reporter |  New Delhi Sep 13, 2014

MPs can launch legal action against Vinod Rai : Cong
Congress out rightly rejected Rai's claims on Manmohan Singh's role in the 2G spectrum & coal block allocations
The Congress has given the go ahead to its party MPs to launch legal proceedings against former CAG Vinod Rai should they want to. Rai had claimed that Congress leaders Ashwani Kumar, Sandeep Dikshit and Sanjay Nirupam had attempted to pressurise him to keep out then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's name from the CAG's audit report. The Congress, yesterday reacting to the loud claims being made by Rai prior to the release of his book, 'Not just an Accountant', described it as nothing but "publicity and marketing" for his book.
Congress national spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi speaking to Business Standard on the issue of whether the party was contemplating suing Rai said, "The Congress stand is that the matter of legal action is upto individual MPs. If they should choose and wish to do so, it is their discretion."
Congress leader and former I & B minister Manish Tewari today tweeted hitting out against Rai, "EX CAG Shoots & Scoots If he has conviction of courage why not accept challenge to an open debate how his sensationalism damaged India Story." In another tweet he said, "EX CAG MISLEADS- No term called Presumptive Loss in the IT Act or DTC. It was put to him in JPC to point out the provision HE HAD NO ANSWER!"
Rejecting Rai's claims on Manmohan Singh's role in the 2G spectrum and coal block allocations, Singhvi has reiterated that these were allegations that had been levelled earlier and had been rejected by the law courts.
As for rai's claims that the three Congress MPs had on the sidelines of the PAC meeting attempted to pressurise him, Singh retorted, "What is telling and fatal to Mr. Rai's view is that both Sandeep Dikshit and Nirupam, I repeat both, joined the PAC much after the tabling of the primary report and apparently Ashwini Kumar the third gentleman joined even later. Now consequently there is no question of them trying on the PAC to influence something which is already over before they joined."
Congress Communication chief took to Twitter to ask, "CAG-See the 42 corruption issues in Gujarat BUT Rai doesn't mention;Arnab doesn't ask; BJP doesn't discuss; WHY???"

LIC in  favour of raising FDI cap in insurance sector to 49%
Public sector insurer LIC has lent its support to government's proposal of raising the FDI limit in the sector to 49 per cent, a move criticised by a section of the select committee that is evaluating amendments to a Bill pending for four years in Rajya Sabha.  Sources said LIC Chairman S K Roy, while presenting the view of the country's largest insurer at a recent meeting of the select committee, was in favour of raising the cap from 26 per cent now, which according to some members is "politica
Public sector insurer LIC has lent its support to government's proposal of raising the FDI limit in the sector to 49 per cent, a move criticised by a section of the select committee that is evaluating amendments to a Bill pending for four years in Rajya Sabha.
Sources said LIC Chairman S K Roy, while presenting the view of the country's largest insurer at a recent meeting of the select committee, was in favour of raising the cap from 26 per cent now, which according to some members is "politically motivated."
Agitated members asked Roy about his company's stance earlier and what made it change its stance. Roy, the source said, "I don't know what LIC's stance was. I will check and let you know."
This led to sharp exchanges between the Committee Chairman Chandan Mitra and Trinamool Congress member Derek O'Brien.
While Mitra tried to pacify members saying that the issue was not important, Derek said he was sensing something "politically fishy" with LIC supporting the proposal.
Roy is the only head among public sector insurers to make a presentation before the 15-member panel. He refused to comment on what transpired during the meeting.
LIC was the sole insurer in the country before the opening up of the sector for foreign investment and since then, it has lost its market share which now stands at 75 per cent.
Derek, however, also declined to comment when contacted, but said, "If this information is true, then LIC Chairman was trying to please his bosses in BJP and BJP is using him for political purpose." He also said his party was not in favour of raising the FDI cap in insurance sector.
The Trinamool Congress leader also said he would write to the Chairman of the Committee asking him to incorporate views of different unions representing the public sector insurance companies before drafting the final report.
Derek said opening up of the sector has not yielded any "significant" result with just Rs 7,700 crore foreign funds coming into the sector in last 15 years and market penetration rising to 4.6 per cent from 1.2 per cent during the period.
Sources said three members from Congress, one each from TMC, CPIM and JD-U expressed their reservations on the passage of the Bill. Six members from BJP, SAD and BJD were in favour and two members from AIADMK and BSP were still undecided. The SP member was not present in any of the two meetings held so far. However, this information could not be individually verified.
After the first meeting of the panel earlier this month, committee chairman Chandan Mitra had said: "We will try to submit our report on the Insurance Bill by the third week of November".
The panel headed by the senior BJP leader also recorded "oral evidence" of the representatives of General Insurance Council, a body set up by insurance regulator IRDA.
Besides, top officials of ministries of Corporate Affairs, Finance, Law and Justice Ministry and Commerce presented their views on the Bill.

Omar says rising water levels in north Kashmir matter of concern; his ministers call on PMWater levels in north Kashmir matter of concern, says Omar
PTI   Srinagar, September 13, 2014
First Published: 19:51 IST(13/9/2014) | Last Updated: 22:30 IST(13/9/2014)
Water levels in North Kashmir are rising which is a matter of concern, Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah said while hoping that it would not be as bad as in the rest of the Valley.

The chief minister said the water levels are "receding" in central Kashmir but they are still above the danger mark and the government was waiting for it to go below the danger mark to "plug the breaches" on the banks of river Jhelum.
 
"Water levels are rising in some parts of north Kashmir. That is a matter of concern. We are hoping that north Kashmir will not be as badly affected as the rest," Abdullah told PTI in an interview.
He said that as per the figures available with the state government so far, 129 people had lost lives in Jammu region whereas 30-35 people were found dead in Kashmir Valley.
 
On the number of people rescued by various agencies so far, he said the Army and NDRF know the exact figures but he was aware of 50,000 people having been rescued by the Army and 20,000-30000 by NDRF.
 
Asked about the extent of loss of lives in the flood, he said "I am hoping and praying that the loss of life will not be as severe as we expect it. Because looking at the situation, the death toll is still remarkably low. I am hoping and praying that it will not be as bad some have been fearing."
 
He said that "within the constraints of (the number of) helicopters, we are doing the best job possible," when asked if the government was able to rescue enough people in the situation.  
On the damage caused to the infrastructure by the floods, Abdullah said officials have already been tasked to assess the damage so that repair and reconstruction activities can be initiated.
    
"Right now, the focus still remains on rescue operations as 1.5 lakh people are still marooned. Our primary focus is on provision of relief like rations, medicines and supplies they require," he said.
Abdullah identified rice, water, medicines as the items required more than anything else.
 
To a query on incidents of stone-pelting and the possibility of involvement of separatists in them, the chief minister said "those people are not from Srinagar. They have been coming in from South and North Kashmir and they have been indulging in thefts and law and order situations"  
On reports about incidents of thefts in marooned houses, he said "it is true".
 
Abdullah  said such incidents have taken place in other countries also as "even in London, when riots took place, there was looting. I wish Jammu and Kashmir had set a better example. I have asked the police to increase their presence."  On the possibility of spread of diseases and epidemic after the flood water recedes, he said Kashmir has a history that lives are not lost in floods but in the aftermath of floods.
 
"Our focus is on provision of medicines and water- purifying medicines like chlorine and lakhs of chlorine tablets have been distributed. We have asked municipalities to activate the sanitation system. Our primary concern is rescue and provision of food, prevention of diseases and epidemics is our priority," he said.
The chief minister noted that a major concern of the people affected by the floods is that they fear that their services would be disconnected for non-payment of bills and absence of recharge for prepaid connections.
 
"I have spoken to the Union telecom minister requesting that the due date of post-paid bills be deferred by 15 days. For prepaid connections, five days extra may be granted for making calls even if there is zero balance," he said.
 
Abdullah said the government is also paying attention to mobile banking so that people can retrieve their money for buying essentials.
 
Asked about the Centre's decision to refuse international aid for relief operations in the state, he said "we should accept help from anywhere in terms of expertise, if available. We are not begging. "  
Flood triggered by heavy rain in Jammu and Kashmir have claimed around 200 lives so far and left thousands homeless. It has also caused extensive damage to road, rail and telecommunication infrastructure in the state.
J-K ministers urge PM to declare national calamity
A high-level ministerial team from J-K called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and requested him to declare the flash floods in the state as "national calamity" and announce a "liberal and pragmatic" financial and special rehabilitation package to restore normalcy at the earliest.
 
The delegation, led by state's finance minister Abdul Rahim Rather, submitted a memorandum to Modi putting forth several demands to help the state government which was grappling with the worst deluge in over 100 years.

"The Prime Minister was very positive and assured us complete support to overcome the crisis," senior minister Ali Mohammed Sagar, who was a part of the delegation, told reporters.
 
While there are no guidelines on declaring any disaster as national calamity, the Centre decides this on case to case basis taking into account intensity and magnitude of the calamity, level of relief assistance, capacity of the state government to tackle the problem, the alternatives and the flexibility available within the plan to provide succour and relief.
 
The Uttarakhand tragedy in 2013 was declared as "calamity of severe nature" and the Centre had given around Rs. 12,000 crore assistance to the state.
 
Modi, during his visit to the state last Sunday, had announced an immediate package of Rs. 1000 crore.

Delhi: Two youths arrested for duping buyers#delhi #fraud #duping #arrest #delhi police
New Delhi: Two youths, who used to allegedly dupe gullible buyers by posting online ads of high-end smartphones at throwaway prices and then handed them cheap duplicates have been arrested, police said.
The two accused, identified as Harpreet Singh (21) and Sahil (21) were arrested by the staff of Outer district. The original phones, money and a car used in the commission of the crime have been recovered by the police.
"On Thursday, one Sachin Yadav had reported that he has been cheated of Rs 22,500 by two youths who were in a black colour Ford Figo car. They had showed him an original Samsung Galaxy S-5 Gold Phone and had handed over him a duplicate phone in lieu of the money," said Deputy Commissioner of Police (Outer) Vikramjit Singh.
The two accused, identified as Harpreet Singh (21) and Sahil (21) were arrested by the staff of Outer district.
Police registered a case of cheating and investigation was taken up.
On the basis of the number noted by the complainant of the car used by the suspects, ownership of the vehicle was ascertained from traffic enquiry.
A police team was sent to the address received from traffic enquiry and Harpreet Singh was arrested from C-376 Sec-1 Rohini, Delhi. On sustained interrogation Singh produced the Samsung Galaxy S-5 Gold phone which he had showed to the customers for sale and had handed over a cheap copy of the
phone, police said.
After the arrest of Singh, search of his associate, identified as Sahil was made and he was also arrested from Pushpanjali where the vehicle used in the case was parked by Harpreet Singh so that no one could trace them.
Rs 22,500 which were taken from the complainant were recovered from Sahil and the car which was used in the offence was also recovered.
"The duo also disclosed that they had applied same modus operandi earlier also. In the earlier instance, they had showed Sony Xperia Z ultra phone to a victim, taken Rs 5000 from him and gave him a replica of Samsung Galaxy S-5," said Singh.
An FIR in this regard was found pending at North Rohini Police Station. That Sony Xperia Z ultra phone was also recovered from Harpreet Singh from his house.
"Both the accused are second year graduation students who used to place advertisement on a popular classified website regarding selling phone at low price, while finalizing the deal they used to show original phone to check and later changed it with duplicate phone by distracting the buyer in
conversation on the pretext of changing the SIM," said Singh.

In massive overhaul  govt proposes stringent new road safety lawsBS Reporter |  New Delhi Sep 13, 2014
Last Updated at 10:37 PM IST
National road safety, vehicle regulation body on the cards
The government is proposing to establish an independent agency with wide powers to ensure road safety
The Centre plans to set up a national authority for road safety and regulation of motor vehicles. The proposed body will have powers to recall motor vehicles in case of any deviation from norms. The authority, Motor Vehicle Regulation and Road Safety Authority of India, will be an independent agency with four-eight members.
The draft Road Transport and Safety Bill, 2014, proposes penalties of up to Rs 3 lakh, along with imprisonment of at least seven years, for death of a child under certain circumstances.
In case at least 100 people report a defect in a particular model of a vehicle to the authority or the model does not comply with the provisions and standards prescribed under the Act, it will be recalled. Manufacturers whose vehicles are subject to a recall order will have to compensate buyers for the full value of the vehicle or replace or repair the defective vehicle with another vehicle of similar or better specifications. The procedure for recall will be laid out by regulations by the Centre.
For faulty manufacturing design, a fine of Rs 5 lakh a vehicle, along with imprisonment, has been proposed.
The road safety authority will also monitor the enforcement of fuel efficiency norms. In consultation with the Bureau of Energy Efficiency, it will issue regulations for necessary improvements in engine efficiency. It might also regulate, recommend and monitor issues related to the manufacture, maintenance, registration, licensing and working of drivers, maintenance and standards of road safety, control of traffic, public-private partnership schemes and promotion of new technologies.
A procedure, as well as a penalty points system, under which fines will be imposed has also been suggested.
For rash and negligent driving, licences will be cancelled.
A penalty of up to Rs 1 lakh or imprisonment for six months, which might be extended to a year, or both will be imposed if vehicle in unsafe conditions are used. In case of drunk driving, a first-time offender will face a fine of Rs 25,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months, or both, as well as a six-month licence suspension. A second offence within three years will result in a fine of Rs 50,000 or imprisonment for up to a year or both, as well as licence suspension for a year. “Any subsequent offence shall result in the cancellation of the licence and impounding of the vehicle, which may extend for 30 days,” the draft Bill says.
If school bus drivers are caught driving drunk, a fine of Rs 50,000 will be imposed, with imprisonment for three years. Violation of traffic signals thrice will lead to a fine of Rs 15,000, licence cancellation for a month and compulsory refresher training.
The draft Bill has been put on the website of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways for comment by stakeholders and the public. The Bill is aimed at reducing fatalities resulting from road accidents by 200,000 in the first five years.
It is expected increased efficiency and road transport safety will boost growth in gross domestic product by four per cent and create a million jobs in the sector, according to the ministry.
India reports about 500,000 road accidents a year, with a death toll of about 140,000.
On the draft Bill, Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari tweeted, “Providing safe, efficient, cost-effective and faster transport across the country is our mission. Our new Bill gives emphasis on e-governance to bring in transparency in the transport sector. Our new ‘golden hour’ policy will provide immediate relief to accident victims and help save lakhs of lives.”
The golden-hour policy provides for treatment to road accident victims within an hour of the accident.
Gadkari said the government expected to introduce the Bill in the Winter Session of Parliament. The Bill has been drafted in sync with the best practices of six advanced countries---the US, the UK, Canada, Singapore, Japan and Germany.

Builders' delaying tactics force flat buyers to take legal action
With dissatisfied buyers increasingly taking legal redress for delays in getting possession of their homes, real estate companies are being forced to recognise consumer needs
On the morning of August 30 this year, around 200 buyers of a DLF apartment complex in South Delhi gathered outside the builder's office in Connaught Place, carrying black flags and placards. They shouted slogans and demanded answers from DLF, the country's biggest and most valuable builder. These were irate buyers of flats in Capital Greens, a residential complex that was supposed to come up in Delhi in June 2012 but still hasn't been completed.
These apartments cost the buyers anywhere between Rs 1 crore and Rs 4 crore. Many had taken loans to make the payments. But even after the EMI meter started ticking, there was no word on when the apartments would be delivered. "I am paying Rs 40,000 a month as instalment, paying through my nose for it," said Jagdish Kumar, who retired as an employee of a nationalised bank. Another buyer, Suchitra Sharma, a flat owner who works in the army.said "I was planning to leave my job and settle down in Delhi." Those plans are now on hold. 
DLF issued a statement later in the day, explaining the delay: "Due to an unfortunate incident at the site, the Delhi government's labour department had passed a prohibitory order till a safety audit was conducted. We are pleased to inform that the site has been found to be compliant. However, we are still awaiting requisite permissions for resumption of construction work from the department and we are in constant touch with the authorities to expedite the clearances."
The agitated buyers, who have come together under the Capital Greens Flat Buyers' Association, were aware that a couple of days earlier, the Supreme Court had asked DLF to deposit Rs 630 crore as penalty in a much publicised-case filed with the in the Competition Commission of India (CCI) by three groups of buyers, including the Belaire Owners Association. They contended that a delay in the delivery of flats and increase in the height of towers without the buyers' consent was an abuse of DLF's dominant position.
A month earlier, the Supreme Court had asked Supertech, another builder, to return the principal amount to buyers of Emerald Court in Noida along with 14% interest. The Residents' Welfare Association (RWA) of Emerald Court had moved the courts alleging that the builder had raised the towers from 24 floors to 40 floors "without maintaining the mandatory distance of 16 metres from the adjoining block", which had made it unsafe and also blocked air and light. It has been reported that associations of other apartment complexes have now approached the Emerald Court Residents' Welfare Association for lessions in how to bring errant builders to book. 
While it might be premature to conclude that residents' and flat-owners' activism has taken deep roots in the housing sector, there is no denying that buyers are a dissatisfied lot. They continue to fall victim to the shenanigans of builders with little recourse to justice. Many builders launch projects without all the necessary clearances in place. Money raised from buyers of one project is diverted unscrupulously to other projects. Delays have become the norm. Definitions of built-up area, super area and carpet area are changed with impunity to suit the interests of the developers. Not for nothing did a 2013 survey by Ernst & Young and Ficci say infrastructure and real estate is perceived as the most corrupt sector of the economy.
The corruption affects the entire supply chain. One ploy many builders use is to build more floors than originally specified. This can have dire consequences. Think of a buyer who has bought an apartment in a 10-floor block. His decision is based on the assumption that he will share the common infrastructure with residents from 10 floors. Midway, the builder decides to add 10 more floors. The buyer now has to share the infrastructure with twice the number of people. This is patently unfair. Look at it from another perspective: when the builder builds a 10-floor block, he digs the foundation to a certain depth; when the additional floors are added, this puts a strain on the foundation. The authorities not only turn a blind eye to this safety hazard but are often found to be hand-in-glove with the builders.
This is what seems to have happened in the Campa Cola Compound at Worli in Mumbai. In the early 1980s, Pure Drinks, which used to make the aerated beverage Campa Cola, gave the rights to three builders to build residential flats on the land. The builders constructed more flats than they were permitted to and sold them to unsuspecting buyers. Most of the buyers didn't realise anything was amiss. Those who raised questions were told that that sanction from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, or BMC, would come shortly with the payment of a nominal fine. The BMC did issue stop-work notices to the builders; in return, they paid penalties and resumed work. When the flats were constructed, nobody from BMC or any other arm of the government prevented the buyers from occupying these flats. After a protracted legal battle, the Supreme Court in June 2014 sanctioned the demolition of the extra constructions. About 100 flat owners were affected.
In order to regulate the sector, the United Progressive Alliance government had introduced the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Bill in the Rajya Sabha last year. The view of the current National Democratic Alliance government on this is not clear. Meanwhile, Maharashtra is all set to become the first state in the country to have a regulator for the housing sector -- the rather obviously-named Housing Regulatory Authority. It has put up a draft of the Maharashtra Housing (Development & Regulation) Rules for public comment till October 10, after which its provisions are likely to come into force. Thus, all developers will have to register their projects with the regulator and disclose the status of the various clearances they are required to get, along with details of the construction costs, land records, deadlines and registration application. These will be verified by the regulator.
A developer will not be allowed to advertise a project unless it has registered the project with the regulator. In case the regulator is convinced that the developer cannot complete the project, the buyers can form a legal entity and complete it. All real estate agents will be required to register themselves with the regulator. This is significant because in most cases, the buyer interacts with the agent who acts as the conduit for all the misinformation.
While this might help the situation in Maharashtra, buyers in the rest of the country have no option but to move against the builders on their own. The lesson buyers have learnt from the verdict against DLF is that collective power is better than a single person filing a complaint. Accordingly, recent complaints have all been filed by groups of residents. "One or two people cannot do anything, so we have formed an association," says Suchitra Sharma, the demonstrator outside DLF. Sanjay Sharma of Qubrex, who is both an activist and a real estate consultant, says there is definitely a change in the attitude of buyers. "There is something good happening. There is a limit to which you can take people for a ride," he says. "Big builders have to answer for deficiency of service."
Lawyers such as Vaibhav Gaggar, who represented the Belaire Owners' Association in the courts, feel more money will flow into real estate if builders are made answerable. Apart from CCI, lawyers are approaching the consumer redressal forums. M L Lahoty, the Supreme Court lawyer who represented the Belaire Owners' Association in CCI has in the last two to three months filed four cases on behalf of consumers.
Builders, on their part, say theirs in not an easy task. Permissions from government departments take years to come rather than months. In a market like Gurgaon, builders say speed money -- a genteel name for bribes -- adds 10-20% to the land cost. And since land accounts for 30-50% of the project cost, speed money escalates overall cost by 3-10%. The builder has no choice but to recover this money from the buyers. Some now give more reasonable completion deadlines to the buyers; changing them from the norm of 36 months, or three years, to a more realistic five-year timetable. Companies such as Raheja Developers and BPTP, in their responses to specific project delays, point out that in several instances, infrastructure around plots, or an apartment block, is not developed despite their regularly following it up with state authorities such as the Haryana Urban Development Authority. The builders, on their own initiative, have sometimes got roads built or even get temporary water and electricity connections from state authorities. These do not form part of their mandate, but they do it anyway to hasten completion of their projects.
With buyers more conscious of their rights now and with builders more responsive, under legal duress, to the needs of the consumers, the instinctive act of buying a home might perhaps prove easier in the days to come.

What is love jihad I dont know  says Rajnath SinghRajnath said there was no information on al-Qaeda carrying out any recruitment drive in the country.
Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: September 12, 2014 3:26 pm | Updated: September 13, 2014 10:26 am
Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Friday said he did not know what “love jihad” is and assured the minority communities that there will be no discrimination in the name of religion or caste.
“Arey yeh hai kya? Hume nahi maloom (What is it? I don’t know),” Singh said at a press conference when asked about the latest issue of RSS mouthpiece Panchjanya, which carried an article on “love jihad”. When reporters persisted with questions on the issue, he said, “I have no idea.”
Addressing the press conference called to showcase the achievements of his ministry on the completion of 100 days, Singh said the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) did not pose any immediate threat to India and the group was not “very active on recruitment front in India”.
On his equation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Singh said, “He is our Prime Minister and an effective Prime Minister and I am the Home Minister in his government. What else?”  After a pause, he said, “Humare sambandh madhur thhe, madhur hain aur madhur rahenge (Our relations were cordial, are cordial and will remain cordial).”
“Working in the Home Ministry is neither a 20-20 nor a one-day cricket match but a test match where one has to play a long innings for which we need to have a strong opening. We have got that a good opening stand, I think. We aspire to play a long innings and even a second innings,” he said.
On a question related to arrest of several young Muslim youths on false terror charges, Singh said, “Minorities should have faith in our government. We will not discriminate against anyone in the name of religion or caste. We will ensure justice to everyone. Injustice will not happen to anyone… If you have any information about anyone specific, please let me know. I will inquire into it.”
He said the withdrawal of NATO troops from Afghanistan in 2015 was a cause of concern for India. “We are discussing the issue of (US) troops withdrawal from Afghanistan and how to deal with the situation. We are taking action… whatever the challenge is, we will face it boldly. I want to assure the people of the nation that there is no need to fear,” the Home Minister said.
Asked about the al-Qaeda’s purported message sent through a video threatening action in some states, he said the authenticity of the CD was still being examined. “We cannot say much about the CD but I want to tell you that we have enough strength to face any challenge from organisations like the al-Qaeda,” he said.
On the possibility of Prime Minister Modi discussing the al-Qaeda threat issue with President Barack Obama during his forthcoming visit to the US, Singh said if the US wants to discuss continued…

Empowerment  governance & infra: 3 focus areas of PM s Digital India campaignDigital India campaign
(IT Minister Ravi Shankar…)
NEW DELHI: Laying out the NDA government's road map for the Digital India campaign , Communications and Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Saturday said, "Indians are very tech savvy. What we need to give is an enabling platform."
Speaking to the media, Prasad emphasised on three key areas that the government would focus on to empower its Digital India campaign. The first area that the government would focus on will be Digital Empowerment of its citizens. He also said that he has written to all CMs stating that the Centre and states have to work together in the IT sector for development.
The Union Minister defined the second key area as providing the Governance and Services on demand. Speaking about inclusion of all states, he voiced Prime Minister Narendra Modi's MyGov initiative and said a conference of IT Ministers of States/UTs will be organized to sensitize states about Vision of Digital India and involve them.
"The third key area for the government will be Digital Infrastructure as a utility to every citizen," said Prasad. Prasad said a draft framework to promote fabless chip design, embedded software and board design industry in India has already been prepared.
Answering concerns on whether bifurcation of united Andhra Pradesh will have any impact on its development as an IT city, he said, "Bangalore and Hyderabad are prime cities in the new knowledge economy and the extraordinary pre-eminence of Hyderabad is to be maintained for development."
He also assured that there was enough money with the government for ensuring the success of Digital India.
Speaking of the booming e-commerce business, Prasad said that it has enormous potential in India and should be allowed to grow. "Since online shopping is increasing, directions have been given to resolve problems, if any, related to online shopping," he added.
The controversial section 66A of the Information Technology Act that was amended by the UPA government also found mention in the Minister's address and he said that there should be a healthy balance between freedom of expression and national security concerns. He asserted that he was an ardent supporter of free media and freedom of speech.

Do Jews really vote Democratic because they are JewsBy David Bernstein September 12
Evan Sayet has a piece on why Jews vote Democratic, which I pass along without endorsement because it’s been a topic of discussion on this blog over the years.
If any of you readers are poli-sci students looking for a thesis topic, how about this one: to what extent, if at all, do Jews really vote more Democratic than others?  Sure, American Jews are more likely to be Democrats than are non-Jews.  But Jews also share a lot of demographic characteristics with Americans in general who vote Democratic: they overwhelmingly live in cities and suburbs, not rural areas, and also overwhemingly live in blue states in the Northeast and in California and Illinois; they are more likely to be religious skeptics and less likely to attend religious services than the average American; and Jewish women, in particular, are heavily concentrated in very Democratic-oriented professions like teacher and social worker.  So let’s say you removed the Jewish variable, and tried to predict how Jews would vote based on their other Demographic criteria–where they live, how much they earn, education levels, religiosity levels, and so on–how much difference would there be? My guess is that there would be some difference, but not as much as most people would think.
UPDATE: Some of the comments seem to start from the premise that almost all Jews are Democrats, so I thought I’d remind readers  that survey data shows that about 15-20% of Jews identify as Republicans and, if you include “leaners,” it’s close to 30%.  My suspicion is that the numbers are even a bit  (but not much) higher than that, because the two Jewish groups most likely to be Republican–Orthodox Jews and Jews from the former USSR, together almost 20% of the American Jewish population–are also least likely to to responsive to pollsters. I addressed why it’s nevertheless not surprising that there are no Republican Jews in Congress here .  Also, responses along the lines of, “well Jews are smart, and they therefore see that the Republicans are the party of ignorance, really are not helpful at all and suggest that you are living in a blue state bubble.  Surveys show that more educated people tend to become more conservative on economics, and more liberal and on social issues, making education something of a wash for party affiliation.

The Family I Didn t Expect to FindWritten by Shannon Heath , Sr. Communications Specialist for SAS
What does it take to be on the Huffington Post's B-team ? Led by Arianna Huffington, this not-for-profit initiative is a group of global business leaders committed to making businesses more socially responsible -- and blogging about it.
It takes a real commitment to corporate culture , and not just the inspirational poster kind of commitment. It takes a real dedication to work/life balance, along with a real understanding from management that this difference can improve business and a real understanding from all employees that this difference can improve their lives.
What's exactly is that difference? Let me tell you a story....
Earlier this year, my family experienced an unexpected tragedy. The kind of tragedy which knocks you out of yourself and turns your whole world upside down. A tragedy which also caused me to be out of work for three months. It was completely unforeseen; we had absolutely no warning. For someone with a self-professed, unapologetic Type A personality, not only did this cause me inexplicable emotional paralysis, it left me panicked for the void I would leave at work -- the unfinished projects, the unmet deadlines, the unattended meetings. I had no time to put together an out of office plan. I had no time to outline current projects or pass them off appropriately to someone who could keep them on track in my absence. I was just plucked right out of work and into a dark hole.
I've worked at previous companies where this kind of tragedy would have been handled cordially and professionally; I would have been given the legally-required allotment of leave. However, at the end of that term, I would have been required to hit the reset button and get right back into the swing of things without missing a beat, assuming that my position hadn't been filled by someone else.
But at SAS , my team stepped in and filled in with no questions or hesitations.  My work was not left undone. My internal and external clients were patient when there was a learning curve with those picking up the pieces of projects unrelated to them. My management checked on me daily. My immediate colleagues, and even those with whom I only work tangentially, checked on my family constantly -- and supplied us with daily meals that lasted for more than three straight months (and we still have food in the freezer!) -- much of which was prepared right here in our SAS campus cafes. Beyond that, our Work/Life department provided library books, online resources and on-going counseling services (all free!) to help us cope.
My manager, my entire team and Human Resources worked with me on a transition plan to help me acclimate back into my work environment -- at my own pace. Facilities even altered my workspace over a weekend to better suit my personal needs before I even came back to work.  The transition back to work was comfortable and comforting. My family felt the benefits of this comfort, as well.
You see, SAS creates family. The emphasis on employee well-being and work/life balance makes family possible. No matter where you are on your career path, SAS makes family possible. The flexible work environment enables most employees to create a schedule that best suits their personal needs -- whether it's attending a school play or taking an aging parent to the doctor. The counselors in the work/life department are a wealth of knowledge and resources for college planning, depression, anger management, eldercare and grief. But, as you can see, it doesn't stop there. Most employees can attest that SAS is family.  We rely on each other. We help each other succeed. We celebrate team successes. We hang out after work. Our kids play together. We feed each other. We grieve together.
Sure, we have a lot of convenience benefits at SAS . I don't want to spell all of those out -- you've probably heard all about them before . And I do appreciate a variety of those offerings every day. But, what really makes a difference to me are the elements of SAS culture that the outside world doesn't always see: The balance.  The camaraderie. The management support. The family it allows me to have -- off campus and on.
This impacts me greatly; and, subsequently it impacts my work. Life happens -- and in some cases, it's impossible to bring your best self to work, no matter how hard you try. Your mind, your heart are somewhere else -- and at SAS, that's where they should be in those situations.   And once you've taken care of whatever that situation is, you're more focused and able to fully function at your desk. Our executives have often said that employees are the driving force behind SAS' consistent revenue growth, profitability and expanding technology.
When you can love what you do, love who you do it with and still maintain a balance in your personal life, you have work utopia. And when employees feel that way about where they work, it shows in their work. Happy employees = happy customers. It's a virtuous cycle.
It sounds simple, right? Yet, so many employers just don't get it.
At SAS, our executives and management genuinely understand that culture directly impacts our customers, and our business; but, they also genuinely understand that culture impacts people. And our people are awesome.
I'm so excited for others to see the side of SAS that I see every day.

Bus falls into gorge in Uttarakhand  16 killed16 killed as bus plunges into stream in Uttarakhand
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  Dehradun, September 13, 2014
First Published: 16:44 IST(13/9/2014) | Last Updated: 21:23 IST(13/9/2014)
Comments
16 people were killed and 15 injured when the bus they were travelling in rolled down a gorge and plunged into a stream in Uttarakhand’s Tehri district on Saturday in one of the worst road accidents in the hilly state in recent times.
 
Tehri Garhwal superintendent of police Mukhtar Moussin said the accident occurred at Juyalgarh near Srinagar Garhwal, 40 km from Pauri, at around 11.30 am.
 
The bus was going from Rishikesh to Chamoli when the driver lost control while overtaking another vehicle at a sharp bend, police said quoting survivors.
 
There were 33 passengers on the bus named ‘Nandadevi Express’ (UK 07/TC 0702) when the mishap occurred.
 
15 persons have been admitted to the base hospital at Srinagar with varying degrees of injuries. Two of the passengers escaped with minor injuries and released after first-aid.
 
Moussin said all the bodies have been retrieved from the mangled remains of the bus, which rolled down nearly 20 feet into the gorge before coming to rest half-submerged in the stream.
 
Earth-moving vehicles and cranes have been deployed to retrieve the bus from the stream.
 
Expressing shock at the loss of lives in the accident, chief minister Harish Rawat announced compensation of Rs. 1 lakh each to the next of kin of the deceased and Rs. 50,000 each for the injured.

Seven from Mizoram held under anti-conversion law in MPPrint
Written by Milind Ghatwai | Bhopal | Posted: September 13, 2014 8:22 pm | Updated: September 13, 2014 8:27 pm
Seven persons, including two women, from Mizoram were arrested under Madhya Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act for allegedly offering money to a labourer to convert to Christianity in Badwah, Khargone district, late on Friday.
In a complaint, Sunil Prajapati, 42, said he was offered Rs one lakh to convert and was told that he would find peace in Christianity. While the Badwah police claimed that Sunil was the complainant, another version said local activists of the VHP and Bajrang Dal took up the matter with the police.
In-charge of Badwah Police Station V S Parihar told The Sunday Express that besides the seven accused from Mizoram, the police were also looking for three local persons who helped the missionaries in their attempt to convert more people.
Parihar said the accused were active in the region for nearly a month and a half and the local people were under an impression that they were teachers in a Christian school. The police are yet to approach the authorities of the educational institution to verify if they were indeed teachers. He said those arrested were sent to judicial custody on Saturday.

Significant leopard population thrives outside protected areasUpdated: September 13, 2014 22:13 IST
‘Significant leopard population thrives outside protected areas’
R. Krishna Kumar
Tweet
There is a significant leopard population outside protected areas in Mysore region and the Forest Department has captured nine leopards in six months this year, said Deputy Conservator of Forests V. Karikalan.
While four leopards were caught in H.D. Kote, three were trapped in Mysore and two in Nanjangud. Mr. Karikalan told The Hindu that the habitat was ideally suited for leopards as there were interconnected shrub jungles, farmlands, and reserve forests.
Besides, there was a human settlement near the forests with a sizeable dog population on which leopards could feed. Hence these cats could survive and even thrive, he added.
When questioned on the need for capturing a leopard in its habitat, Mr. Karikalan clarified that they were trapped in a cage in human territory and released in nearby jungles. This was part of a capture-and-release exercise and animals were not translocated to a different place. The leopard found dead atop a tree in Kalahalli village, whose carcass was lowered with a rope, belonged to the same group of leopards which were caught in H.D. Kote in March this year. Though most relocated leopards adjust to the habitat in the forests, some prefer to live on the fringes and return, said Mr. Karikalan.
“People must learn to co-exist with leopards and not create a commotion on sighting them. They are generally shy creatures that prey on dogs and return to the fringe areas, and should not be disturbed,” he added.
Leopards are found in Chamundi Hills, Chikkadevana Betta, Malleshwara Gudda, Yelwal, H.D. Kote, Nanjangud and surrounding areas. The region has a history of leopard sightings and these cats have been caught from Infosys campus, BEML campus, Mandya National Papers Mill compound, Vijayanagar, Gowrishankar Nagar, Lalitadripura, and Uttanahalli. Cubs are frequently found in the sugarcane fields.

Scotland referendum:  No  vote favourite as millions bet on close finishprint
Bookmakers have accepted millions of pounds in bets on the results of the referendum, with the 'No' vote attracting the most bets, reflecting the popular belief and hope that in the end, the photo-finish vote will go against independence for Scotland.
 
As opinion polls continued to predict a close finish, the 'No' bets accounted for around £4.5 million of the £6 million matched on the betting exchange Betfair so far. People have also placed bets on the percentage of votes each option will attract and the overall voting percentage.
 
Experts at the bookmaker Ladbrokes estimate that as much as £50 million could be wagered on the race if the polls remain tight in the coming days. Official figures indicate that 97% of Scotland’s 4.4 million population have registered to vote in the referendum.
 
A new opinion poll by Survation released on Saturday suggested that the ‘No’ vote enjoyed 54% support, against 46% for the ‘Yes’ vote. It reflects marginal increase in the support for the ‘No’ vote, but experts caution that such polls are invariably based on a fraction of the population.
 
In a significant intervention, members of the Orange Order and bandsmen from Northern Ireland joined a rally supporting the ‘No’ vote in Edinburgh. Orange Order has traditionally supported union with the United Kingdom.
 
The order’s Grand Master Edward Stevenson said: "Our strength in numbers here today - in one of the largest Orange gatherings in recent times held in the UK - not only demonstrates our commitment to the cause, but also our grave concern at the imminent threat to the Union we all hold so dear."
 
Claims and counter-claims continued to be made on the effect on banks and business in the event of Scotland voting for independence. The ‘Yes’ group accused the rival ‘No’ group of engineering scare stories from business and bank leaders.
 
First minister Alex Salmond said the Scots would not be "bullied" by oil companies, supermarkets or London, while chief economist at Deutsche Bank David Folkerts-Landau said voters and politicians had failed to grasp the negative consequences of independence.

Mamata s decline: It s now Ma  Mati  Mafia#mamata banerjee #west bengal #tmc #cpm #sarada chit fund scam #cbi #tata
Mamata Banerjee belongs to the dwindling tribe of regional politicians who look upon their profession through a partisan lens, which means that their focus is almost entirely on advancing the prospects of their parties. They have neither the ability nor the inclination to do anything for their states.
Some are also fixated on augmenting their own bank balances. Fortunately, the West Bengal chief minister is not one of them. But she is with the others in the matter of having little idea of purposeful governance and economic progress.
In this respect, she isn't very different from the likes of, say, Lalu Prasad or Mulayam Singh Yadav of the Hindi heartland who believe that their being in power is enough to satisfy those belonging to their caste, in this case the Yadavs, along with others in the intermediate castes, and that their followers do not care if there are no roads or electricity.
The slogan behind her victory was "Ma-Mati-Manush", which underlined her proximity to ordinary people and the pursuit of a compassionate version of politics unlike the hauteur and aggression of the Marxists.
In Mamata's case, it isn't caste which propelled her to the top of the popularity charts around 2010-11, but the promise of change or 'poriborton' from the three-decade-old Left rule. The change was to be not only from economic stagnation, caused by the flight of capital because of militant trade union tactics and frequent strikes, but also from the high-handedness of the Communist cadres who ruled the roost in virtually every locality.
It was Mamata's courageous stance against these political goons, exemplified during the agitations in Singur and Nandigram against the acquisition of land, which laid the foundation of her electoral triumph in 2011. The slogan behind her victory was "Ma-Mati-Manush", which underlined her proximity to ordinary people and the pursuit of a compassionate version of politics unlike the hauteur and aggression of the Marxists.
However, the 'poriborton' which she promised has turned out to be for the worse. The reasons are, first, her inability to make the transition from being a rabble-rouser to an administrator. Almost all her acts have been motivated by a desire to grab the headlines - from walking out of the Manmohan Singh government on the issue of foreign investment in the retail sector to opposing Pranab Mukherjee's candidature for the president's post.
Secondly, her decision to oust the Tatas from Singur, where the first Nano factory was to be built, has meant that she has burnt her boats so far as the industrial community is concerned. As a result, all her attempts to woo the Ambanis in Mumbai or overseas investors in Singapore have come to naught.
Where her predecessor in the chief minister's chair, Buddhadev Bhattacharjee, realized in the twilight of his tenure the folly of the Marxists in driving out the industrialists, Mamata began her stint by making the same mistake in Singur and is now paying the price for it.
But economic stagnation is not her only Achilles heel. Under her, the cadres of the ruling Trinamool Congress have begun to emulate the Marxist goons of the earlier years in full measure - terrorizing ordinary people and members of rival parties and extorting money from builders and entrepreneurs. Hence, the coinage of the term, Ma-Mati-Mafia, by the chief minister's critics.
To make matters worse, Mamata's own conduct has exposed her to a great deal of flak, especially her cynical reaction to incidents of rape, such as the one on Park Street in 2012 which she described as 'sajano ghatona' or a concocted incident, and her intolerance which led to the arrest of a professor who had made fun of her in a cartoon on the internet.
Not surprisingly, a high court judge has wanted to know why the professor was arrested in such a hurry while Tapas Paul, an MP who called upon his listeners in a public rally to rape and kill Leftist women, has gone scot-free so far.
The perceptible fall in Mamata's popularity has led to an understandable rise in the BJP's prospects although the saffron party had never been a major player in West Bengal till now. For instance, in the 2009 parliamentary polls, it secured six percent of the votes and four percent in the 2011 assembly elections. Now, there has been a jump in its vote share to 16.8 percent, which can only be explained by the fact that the voters are now turning to the only alternative before them in view of their disillusionment with both the Marxists and Trinamool.
Their disappointment is now turning to anger as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is closing in on the bigwigs in Trinamool for their suspected complicity in the Sarada chit fund scam. The extent of Mamata's nervousness over this development is evident from the protests which her party organised against the CBI in Kolkata and her threat to set the cadres on the media which, she thinks, is ruining her image.
Not since BC Roy's death in 1962 has the state had a leader capable of restoring its primacy of place in the country's industrial and cultural fields as before. The slide which began under the Communists has continued with the conditions seemingly reaching their lowest point under Mamata. Rarely has a state experienced such a prolonged period of bad luck.

J&K floods: India Inc donates to relief efforts#jammu and kashmir #jammu and kashmir flood #pmo #india inc
New Delhi: The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) Saturday said that it has received generous donations from India Inc. for carrying out rescue and relief operations in Jammu and Kashmir in the aftermath of the flood calamity in the state.
"The corporate sector is coming forward to extend its support to the flood-affected people of Jammu and Kashmir," the PMO said.
"Yesterday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had appealed for generous donations towards Prime Minister's National Relief Fund, to help the people of Jammu and Kashmir in this hour of crisis."
"The corporate sector is coming forward to extend its support to the flood-affected people of Jammu and Kashmir," the PMO said.
According to the PMO, the Mahindra & Mahindra Group and Samsung Electronics have donated Rs.2 crores and Rs.3 crores respectively to the Prime Minister's National Relief Fund.
Domestic airlines like Jet Airways, GoAir, IndiGo, SpiceJet and Air India have also been making specific contributions to the ongoing relief and rescue operations in Jammu and Kashmir.
Apart from carrying supplies to Srinagar, the airlines have played a crucial role in evacuation and provided medical aid and psychiatric help to the survivors.
Other companies such as BSNL have been working hard to restore communications in the state, while central government and some private organisations' employees have donated a day's salary towards the rescue efforts being undertaken in the state.

10 Things Wildly Successful People Wish They Knew At 18reddit
It's September. School just started again, yet I won't be going back this fall (gasp!!!) .
Instead, I'm taking a year off from school in order to take control of my own education, and will be documenting all of my experiences on a new blog I just launched called The Gap Year Experiment .
With no curriculum to follow, and a world full of opportunities now available at my fingertips, I had to decide what things were most important to learn. What are the skills, experiences, and habits I could create during my "gap year experiment" that would help me get the most out of the next 365 days of my life?
To answer that, I asked some of my mentors, friends, and role models to give me their 1-3 sentence responses to the following question:
Knowing what you do now, if you could have taught yourself and/or done one thing at 18 years old to create a better foundation for your future success, what would it have been and why?
These lessons, as I quickly came to realize, were too valuable for me to keep to myself, so without further adieu, here is what I learned.
Success in Business
1. "When I was 18, I was full of dreams, energy and excitement. I couldn't wait to graduate and start making money. I saw an Opportunity to go into business with my brothers and I seized it! I Worked hard and Never gave up. Years later, I started reading and filling my mind with ideas and Inspiration. It changed my life and my career took off! If you are just starting out don't wait. Time is your most precious resource. Invest it. Use it well. Start now!" -- Peter van Stralen, CEO of Sunshine Brands
2. "Be unapologetically true yourself, both in business and in life, and broadcast who you are to the world. The right people will eventually find you." -- Tony Hsieh, CEO of Zappos
3. "If I had been focused on my future, I may never have had this one. If I had been focused on foundations, I may never have built one. If I had been focused on success, I may never have achieved it. You have to do what you love because you love it and not for any other reason. And so I have nothing to teach my 18-year-old self because it's my 18-year-old self that my present-day self should be learning from." -- Neil Strauss, NYT Bestselling Author
4. "By 18, I had worked four summers on the construction crew of my dad's company, held after school jobs in gas stations. I also cleaned a bakery, and after leaving high school worked on a road-building crew to make the streets for a new subdivision in my home town. Without a doubt it was the diversity of the people that I met during this time that expanded my view towards becoming an entrepreneur, versus following the typical University-to-life career path of my friends. I narrowly avoided joining a bank in a coastal town so I could surf every day, when the local grocery store owner took me aside and said, 'You have so much you can do with your life, so get out and explore.' So, looking back I would not wish to have changed anything. Traveling was the most critical step in me seeing opportunity, especially the fact that nobody in America owned sheepskin boots, while the product was everywhere in Australia, which ultimately led to UGGs." -- Brian Smith, Founder of UGG Australia, Author and Speaker
Finding Mentors
5. "To create a better foundation for success, I would have welcomed the advice of working with a mentor sooner. I was quite independent early in my career (few female mentors were available), thinking that dependence on others and asking questions were a sign of weakness, as was failure.  Instead over time, I learned that I didn't have to go it alone. The goal of a mentor is  to shorten our  learning curve. Failure wasn't an option early on; now it is the only option.  Fail Faster, Succeed Sooner, is part of my philosophy. The power of relationships, particularly of a mentor and a mastermind, means that I can ask for the help and expertise of others to move forward more quickly." -- Dr. Cheryl Lentz, The Academic Entrepreneur
6. "The best foundation is built on someone else's mistakes. Find a mentor about 10-15 years older and grab onto their wisdom. Competition is too stiff to allow for many mistakes of your own!" -- Bud Moeller, Former Partner at Accenture and Professional Race Car Driver
7. "Though it can be tough, force yourself to be in situations where you feel like the dumbest person in the room. Constantly surround yourself with people smarter than you, but don't allow it to intimidate you; instead, use it as an opportunity to learn." -- Nick Arnett, Summit Community Development Manager for the Thiel Foundation
8. "If I could have done one thing at 18 to better my foundation for success, I would have become an apprentice. I would have spent a lot of time reflecting on areas that fired me up, and then I would have found those who were absolutely CRUSHING it in these fields. I would rank them sequentially, and then reach out to them individually describing in detail how I could ADD VALUE to their lives in exchange for learning from them. Would I get a lot of no's? YES. Would I keep persevering until I found a mentor? YES. What you put out in the universe becomes a magnet...and this magnet would result in a powerful mentor to guide me through my late teens, early 20's." -- John Lee Dumas, Founder of EntrepreneurOnFire
On Building Skills
9. "I would have taught myself more programming languages. At 18, I had dabbled in computer science a little bit and could build a blog, but that was about it. If I could go back and teach myself anything, it'd be more programming languages. There's something incredibly powerful about being able to sit down at a computer and prototype an idea in a weekend without having to call upon your "techie" friends to help you." -- Stacey Ferreira, CEO of AdMoar, Co-Founder of 2 Billion Under 20
10. "If I could have taught myself one thing, it would have been how to get over my early fear of cold calling and cold approaching individuals I don't know. So many of The Muse's biggest successes are due to cold outreach, and I wish I'd forced myself to get comfortable with this a lot sooner!" -- Kathryn Minshew, CEO of The Muse

Maharashtra: Uddhav wants to be CM; Sena talks tough on seat-sharingBJP, Sena in tussle as Uddhav eyes CM post
Dharmendra Jore , Hindustan Times  Mumbai, September 13, 2014

With the Maharashtra assembly elections just a month away, the whiff of a likely win has intensified the tussle over the chief minister’s post in the saffron alliance.
While Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray said on Saturday his party would get the top job in the state, ally Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) maintained that the outcome of the October 15 polls would decide who gets the chief minister’s post.
Thackeray, who has till now avoided expressing his chief ministerial ambitions, on Saturday told the Aaj Tak news channel that he would not shy away from the responsibility although he was not dreaming of being the chief minister. “When the country wanted a change, Narendrabhai (Modi) came forward. Now, it is Maharashtra’s turn, and the people here, too, need a face when they go out to vote,” he said.
Uddhav’s stand makes it clear why he is opposed to the BJP’s demand for more seats. The BJP has been mounting pressure on the Sena to rework the existing seat-sharing agreement, but the Sena leadership is not too keen as they know that the party which contests more seats will have better chances of bagging the chief minister’s post.
A factional feud has broken out within the BJP, with at least five top BJP leaders — including state BJP president Devendra Fadnavis, Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari, Opposition leaders in the Council and Assembly Vinod Tawde and Eknath Khadse — projecting themselves as the next CM.
Meanwhile, in an editorial in the Sena mouthpiece Saamana, on Saturday said, “excessive lust leads to divorce” and asked the constituents of ‘Mahayuti’ alliance to exercise restraint while demanding extra share during seat allocation talks. Citing a recent court verdict, the party said, “All parties must give up the lust for more seats. To say we will stay in the coalition only if we get ‘so many seats’ is not right,” the editorial said.
The remarks are being considered a veiled criticism of BJP amid reports that the latter had sought more seats to contest this time around.

Water levels in north Kashmir matter of concern: OmarWater levels in north Kashmir matter of concern, says Omar
PTI   Srinagar, September 13, 2014
First Published: 19:51 IST(13/9/2014) | Last Updated: 22:30 IST(13/9/2014)
Water levels in North Kashmir are rising which is a matter of concern, Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah said while hoping that it would not be as bad as in the rest of the Valley.

The chief minister said the water levels are "receding" in central Kashmir but they are still above the danger mark and the government was waiting for it to go below the danger mark to "plug the breaches" on the banks of river Jhelum.
 
"Water levels are rising in some parts of north Kashmir. That is a matter of concern. We are hoping that north Kashmir will not be as badly affected as the rest," Abdullah told PTI in an interview.
He said that as per the figures available with the state government so far, 129 people had lost lives in Jammu region whereas 30-35 people were found dead in Kashmir Valley.
 
On the number of people rescued by various agencies so far, he said the Army and NDRF know the exact figures but he was aware of 50,000 people having been rescued by the Army and 20,000-30000 by NDRF.
 
Asked about the extent of loss of lives in the flood, he said "I am hoping and praying that the loss of life will not be as severe as we expect it. Because looking at the situation, the death toll is still remarkably low. I am hoping and praying that it will not be as bad some have been fearing."
 
He said that "within the constraints of (the number of) helicopters, we are doing the best job possible," when asked if the government was able to rescue enough people in the situation.  
On the damage caused to the infrastructure by the floods, Abdullah said officials have already been tasked to assess the damage so that repair and reconstruction activities can be initiated.
    
"Right now, the focus still remains on rescue operations as 1.5 lakh people are still marooned. Our primary focus is on provision of relief like rations, medicines and supplies they require," he said.
Abdullah identified rice, water, medicines as the items required more than anything else.
 
To a query on incidents of stone-pelting and the possibility of involvement of separatists in them, the chief minister said "those people are not from Srinagar. They have been coming in from South and North Kashmir and they have been indulging in thefts and law and order situations"  
On reports about incidents of thefts in marooned houses, he said "it is true".
 
Abdullah  said such incidents have taken place in other countries also as "even in London, when riots took place, there was looting. I wish Jammu and Kashmir had set a better example. I have asked the police to increase their presence."  On the possibility of spread of diseases and epidemic after the flood water recedes, he said Kashmir has a history that lives are not lost in floods but in the aftermath of floods.
 
"Our focus is on provision of medicines and water- purifying medicines like chlorine and lakhs of chlorine tablets have been distributed. We have asked municipalities to activate the sanitation system. Our primary concern is rescue and provision of food, prevention of diseases and epidemics is our priority," he said.
The chief minister noted that a major concern of the people affected by the floods is that they fear that their services would be disconnected for non-payment of bills and absence of recharge for prepaid connections.
 
"I have spoken to the Union telecom minister requesting that the due date of post-paid bills be deferred by 15 days. For prepaid connections, five days extra may be granted for making calls even if there is zero balance," he said.
 
Abdullah said the government is also paying attention to mobile banking so that people can retrieve their money for buying essentials.
 
Asked about the Centre's decision to refuse international aid for relief operations in the state, he said "we should accept help from anywhere in terms of expertise, if available. We are not begging. "  
Flood triggered by heavy rain in Jammu and Kashmir have claimed around 200 lives so far and left thousands homeless. It has also caused extensive damage to road, rail and telecommunication infrastructure in the state.
J-K ministers urge PM to declare national calamity
A high-level ministerial team from J-K called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and requested him to declare the flash floods in the state as "national calamity" and announce a "liberal and pragmatic" financial and special rehabilitation package to restore normalcy at the earliest.
 
The delegation, led by state's finance minister Abdul Rahim Rather, submitted a memorandum to Modi putting forth several demands to help the state government which was grappling with the worst deluge in over 100 years.

"The Prime Minister was very positive and assured us complete support to overcome the crisis," senior minister Ali Mohammed Sagar, who was a part of the delegation, told reporters.
 
While there are no guidelines on declaring any disaster as national calamity, the Centre decides this on case to case basis taking into account intensity and magnitude of the calamity, level of relief assistance, capacity of the state government to tackle the problem, the alternatives and the flexibility available within the plan to provide succour and relief.
 
The Uttarakhand tragedy in 2013 was declared as "calamity of severe nature" and the Centre had given around Rs. 12,000 crore assistance to the state.
 
Modi, during his visit to the state last Sunday, had announced an immediate package of Rs. 1000 crore.

Cannons were fired outside the Mysore palace to accustom them to the noise
The Dasara elephants have been rehearsing daily since their arrival here from their respective jungle camps to get accustomed to the noise and crowds.
With the second batch of elephants arriving, the second leg of the run through began on Saturday.
The elephants were familiarised with the booming sound of the cannons which were fired during a practice session outside the palace, near the parking lot, on Saturday.
A 22-member team of police personnel from the City Armed Reserve (CAR), with the backing of a team of forest personnel, conducted the drill, as hundreds of tourists watched the proceeding with wonder. Several rounds of cannon gun fires took place to get the elephants, including the lead tusker Arjuna, who carries the 750-kg golden howdah, accustomed to the deafening sound.
On the day of Vijayadashami, cannons are fired for 21 times outside the palace fort to signal the beginning of Jamboo Savari, which marks the Dasara finale. To prevent the jumbos from getting nervous, the rehearsal of cannon gunfires is conducted three to four times in the run-up to the Dasara finale every year.
Police Commissioner M.A. Saleem and Deputy Conservator of Forest V. Karikalan supervised the proceedings. Forest veterinarian Nagaraj and mahouts and kavadis were present. The cannons, some of them century old, were recently refurbished by the CAR personnel for the festivities. Seven cannons will be in the custody of the palace.
According to police sources, 1,800 grams of gun powder (stored in a small cotton bag) is placed inside the cannon and fired. Earlier, two kg of gun powder was used for firing but the quantity was reduced last year. Each cannon needs about five persons to operate.
Kumar, who is attached to the CAR, said each round of fire needs cleaning to remove leftovers inside the cannon for another round of firing. “It’s a meticulous job and we need to be careful,” said Kumar, who has been doing this job for the last 18 years.
Mahadevappa, a CAR policeman, said the cannons are fired at the palace and also at Bannimantap where the procession concludes. There are seven cannons and three rounds are fired from each cannon to complete a 21-gun salute.
The police had a tough time controlling crowds as tourists arrived in large numbers for the weekend. Parking of tourists’ vehicles was shifted temporarily in view of the rehearsal. The gunfires resulted in thick smoke in the vicinity.
All necessary precautionary measures were taken in view of the rehearsal.

Power  water supplies snapped in Ajit Singh houseGovt cuts power, water to squatting netas’ houses
Moushumi Das Gupta , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, September 13, 2014

The government on Saturday disconnected power and water connections to the houses of around 30 former MPs and cabinet ministers who have refused to vacate their plush bungalows in spite of several eviction notices.
The extreme step affected around two dozen ex-MPs across party lines, including former cabinet ministers Ajit Singh and Jitendra Singh, and former Jharkhand chief minister Babulal Marandi.
As a result of the move —carried out by the New Delhi Municipal Council under orders from the urban development ministry — around 15 former MPs moved out by Saturday evening, NDMC chairperson Jalaj Srivastava told HT.
Former MPs whose power and water lines were snapped include Congress’ Vijay Inder Singla, Mohd. Azharuddin, Avtar Singh Bhadana, who has since left the party, CPI (M)’s Khagen Das, BJP’s BY Raghavendra, son of former Karnataka chief minister BS Yeddyuruppa, and former prime minister Chandra Shekhar’s son Neeraj Sekhar.
“Till Saturday evening, we disconnected supply to 27 of the bungalows. Power and water supply will not be restored till new occupants move in,” said Srivastava. The step to disconnect power and water lines is the first in over a decade.
Ministry sources said the unprecedented decision was taken after the Lok Sabha House Committee — which allots bungalows and flats to MPs — and the UD ministry, which allots houses to cabinet ministers, met earlier this week to review the status of government accommodation yet to be vacated.
 “Former MPs and ministers were asked to vacate their official accommodation by June 5. We gave them several extensions but 30 of them continued to overstay, leaving us no other option,” said a government official involved with the eviction drive.
Getting former ministers and MPs to vacate their bungalows has become a big worry for the government. Last week, RLD leader and former aviation minister Ajit Singh’s supporters blocked an eviction attempt by surrounding the 12 Tughlaq Road bungalow, not letting the team in. The UD ministry team was forced to beat a hasty retreat.
The government last resorted to a forceful eviction in 2009 after Republican Party of India chief Ramdas Athawale failed to vacate his Lodhi Estate bungalow despite several notices. Eviction officers from the UD ministry went to Athawale’s residence and forcibly removed all his belongings from the house.

Railway Minister Gowda s son questioned for 2nd day over actress  charge#dv sadananda gowda #railway minister #bangalore police #karthik gowda
Bangalore: Railway Minister DV Sadananda Gowda's son Karthik Gowda underwent a gruelling questioning for the second consecutive day on Saturday in connection with alleged rape, kidnap and cheating of a Kannada actress.
After another round of marathon questioning, DCP North TR Suresh said, "We are gathering information. We have asked him questions relating to the investigation. He has answered them. If we need any more information we will call him and seek information."
He said that Karthik had been cooperating. "Yesterday he had come. We had called him again today. He had been here from around 10 AM to around 6 PM. He has been coming here and giving information to our queries."
After another round of marathon questioning, DCP North TR Suresh said, "We are gathering information. We have asked him questions relating to the investigation. He has answered them."
Days after securing an anticipatory bail, Karthik had on Friday appeared before police for the first time and faced a marathon questioning by them before being subjected to a medical test.
During questioning, Karthik had rejected the allegations and said he had not married the starlet as claimed by her. The Sessions court had granted anticipatory bail to Karthik and asked him to cooperate with police in the probe. A magistrate court had earlier issued an arrest warrant against him with police declaring him an absconder and forming teams to trace him.
The actress had claimed she and Karthik got married at Gowda's residence in Mangalore in June. Her claim came on the day Karthik got engaged to another woman at Kushalnagar in Kodagu district. Her allegations caused severe embarrassment to the Union Minister who has maintained law will take its own
course.

West Bengal: BJP  CPM  Congress spreading canards against TMC  says Partha Chatterjee#west bengal #tmc #bjp #cpm #congress #mamata banerjee #partha chatterjee
Kolkata: Accusing opposition BJP, CPI(M), and Congress of spreading canards against the Trinamool Congress (TMC) regime in West Bengal, TMC leader and state minister Partha Chatterjee on Saturday accused BJP of trying to influence the polls.
"Just like when Congress was in power they had tried to influence the polls, the BJP has tried to influence them this time too but the people will give them a beffiting reply. "The Congress, CPI(M), and BJP has been spreading canards against TMC and our party supremo in order to malign us. But they won't be successful as the blessing of the masses is with us," Chatterjee said.
"The people of Bengal will not lend a ear to the canards spread by BJP as they are happy with the massive developmental work that is being done by Mamata Banerjee's government," he said.

Kollegal S. Gopalakrishna has been chosen for the Karnataka Kalashree Award for 2013-2014
He may have been born blind, but that didn’t deter him from making music the light of his life. Kollegal S. Gopalakrishna is one among the artistes and musicians, who have been chosen by the Karnataka Sangeetha Nritya Academy for the Karnataka Kalashree Award for 2013-2014.
A native of Kollegal in Chamarajanagar, R. Seetharaman and Seethamma admitted their child to the Blind and Dumb School in Mysore. However, thanks to the musical leanings of his parents — his father was a flutist and mother a singer of traditional songs — he took to music effortlessly.
He became the disciple of veterans such as T.M. Murugesh Mudaliyar, court musician B.S. Shivarudrappa and vidwan Venkatappa.
Belonging to the Nayak community (Scheduled Tribes), Mr. Gopalakrishna (68) started his career as a teacher of music in the Government High School at Chickmagalur, Srinivasapur and later at Kolar, which became his home. He also performed at concerts and gave solos on the violin. Thousands of people across Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh were enthralled by the performance of this blind artist.
He has been felicitated by a number of organisations and won numerous titles. Among them are Best Musician and Best Violinist, by Bangalore’s Gayana Samaj and Kolar district administration’s district-level Rajyotsava Award in 1998.
After retirement, Mr. Gopalakrishna teaches music at the Sunada Sangeeta Shikshana Shaale in Kolar.

The Case Against Apple PayStill can't replace the old billfold.

This article originally appeared in Inc .
You don’t need Apple Pay . Of course, I could say that about many other products Apple has succeeded in convincing you to love. But with the tech giant’s newest foray into the incestuous morass of mobile payments, Apple is taking on a particularly tricky challenge. (Yes, even more than with its ridiculously elaborate timepiece. )
Advertisement
I’ve long been a skeptic about mobile payments. Tech companies and big banks have been trying to make their "digital wallets" happen for years, with little luck. (Just ask Google , and that company formerly known as Isis .) Why construct an elaborate fix to something that’s not broken? Why bother with smartphones and thumbprints and buggy digital scanners at the checkout counter, when you could just swipe a piece of plastic and go?
"The core challenge Apple faces is that buying things with a credit card isn’t nearly as onerous a process as they make it out to be," as the New York Times adroitly summed up this week. And there’s an even better argument for Apple Pay skepticism in Thursday’s Wall Street Journal, which boiled the hurdle for Apple down to numbers .
That is, 220,000 versus 9 million: the number of U.S. retailers where you can use Apple Pay starting in October, versus the number of places where you can currently use a credit or debit card. In other words, Apple Pay isn’t going to work at 97.6 percent of the places where you can shop in this country—and retailers aren’t exactly rushing to embrace the newest technology. Best Buy, for example, has installed the digital scanners that its checkout clerks would need to scan your iPhone 6, but "switched them off in 2011 because the cost of supporting the platform was too high" and "has no plans to change course following Apple's announcement," the WSJ reported.
That’s really the crux of the problem for Apple, and Google, and PayPal, and that Isis that President Obama isn’t promising to destroy. You can sell consumers any new kind of technology (or new ballad-rock album, for that matter) if you wrap it up with something they already love and plan to buy. But you can’t control how they use it, if they use it, or indeed if they can use it. Right now retailers are the ones who control how consumers use this kind of technology, and they are far from fully on board.
Businesses, especially startups, have several reasons to resist upgrading their technology. There’s the cost of installing the new scanners, and the cost of training staffers to use them. There’s the fact that many of the smallest businesses, the food trucks and the startups that rely on Square or Amazon or PayPal to accept credit cards, won’t be able to use Apple Pay. Those systems "aren't equipped to process NFC payments," the WSJ wrote, referring to the "near-field communication" technology used to scan the digital wallets on smartphones.
And then there are the potential increased costs to small businesses if Apple Pay takes off. Accepting credit and debit cards is already an expensive proposition for retailers, especially the small ones that don’t have a lot of negotiating power with the big banks and credit card processing companies. Retailers pay, on average, 2 percent of every sale in these so-called swipe fees, which are split between banks, networks like Visa and MasterCard, processors, and sometimes a whole host of other companies. Now Apple is coming in and asking for a piece of the action, too.
Bloomberg reports that banks will pay the tech company a fee for each Apple Pay transaction, cutting into the $40 billion in profits that the banking industry collects from retailers every year. And if the banks and credit card companies are giving up some profits to Apple, how long do you think it will be before they start charging businesses higher swipe fees to make up the difference? That prospect won’t make retailers rush to embrace anything.
So the case against Apple Pay seems pretty easy to make—which isn’t to say there aren’t reasons the technology could eventually take off. The primary ones are security and convenience, though the former is a bit of an awkward conversation for Apple and CEO Tim Cook in the wake of iCloud’s implication in the celebrity photo-theft debacle.
But if Apple can shake that, it might convince both businesses and consumers that its digital wallet could help prevent future data breaches. The iPhone’s fingerprint-only payment access and the "tokenization" feature of Apple Pay are two features that could help stave off the recurring massive thefts of consumer data from retailers.
Tokenization is "a technical way of saying that the merchant never sees the credit card information the consumer is using when buying items using Apple Pay. … Breaches at [retailers like] Target and Home Depot wouldn't happen if the companies didn't have consumer credit card information in the first place," my former colleague Rob Blackwell wrote at American Banker this week.
And then there’s the convenience factor—or, to be clear, the distant but still potentially attainable prospect of the convenience factor. It’s a great prospect. I am not immune to daydreams about the day when I can leave my home with only my phone—no keys, no wallet, no credit card or cash, no subway card, no driver’s license, and no work ID needed.
So if the state government and the New York subway system and Apple and the banks and all the places where I want to shop and my office building and my apartment building could work together to get all of that digitized and put onto the iPhone 7 or 8 … I’m in. Skepticism assuaged. I might even wait in line to buy one. But until all of that happens, it’s hard to see Apple pulling off what it does with its best products and turning Apple Pay into something you never realized you needed.

Is It the Whiskey or the Oil?
Why Scotland thinks it can survive as an independent country.
By Jordan Weissmann

With one week to go before the big referendum, it seems distinctly possible that Scotland will rock Europe by voting to declare independence from Great Britain. And like so many world-historic events of the past century, this one would have lots to do with oil.
Jordan Weissmann
Jordan Weissmann is Slate's senior business and economics correspondent.
Think of Scotland’s most famous exports, and chances are that whiskey comes to mind, followed maybe by wool sweaters, bagpipes, and indie-rock bands. But the region’s most valuable product is the crude oil that sits just offshore in the North Sea. In 2013, those wells yielded about 800,000 barrels of oil per day for Great Britain. That’s not a ton of black gold in the global scheme of things—North Dakota, by comparison, produces more than a million barrels per day—but it’s valuable, yielding billions of pounds in tax revenue every year. If Scotland were to file for geo-political divorce, the consensus is that it would walk away with the rights to more than 90 percent of those oil resources, along with 47 percent of the U.K.’s natural gas.
Even without its oil revenues, Scotland would be quite a rich country.
Those hydrocarbons look awfully tantalizing to Scotland’s nationalists. Politically, golf’s ancestral homeland is more liberal than the rest of Great Britain, and its voters especially dislike the ruling Conservative Party led by Prime Minister David Cameron. (In an emotional speech, Cameron himself begged his countrymen not to vote for independence just to “give the effing Tories a kick.”) In its economic case for independence , the Scottish National Party–led regional government—which is charged with handling much of Scotland’s internal affairs—spends page upon page protesting growing income inequality in Great Britain, as well as the Cameron government’s austerity budgets and cuts to the safety net. Post-secession, the nationalists picture Scotland following in the crude-drenched footsteps of Norway, which plows its princely oil revenues into a sovereign wealth fund designed to shore up its substantial welfare state.

It’s a lovely vision, but there’s a catch: Nobody is really sure how much oil and gas is left in the North Sea, where crude production peaked all the way back in 1999 , and has been declining swiftly in recent years . Tax revenue from drilling fell from £12.4 billion in 2008-09 to £6.5 billion in 2012-13. As for the future, the predictions are all over the map . The Scottish National Party has optimistic estimates based on the assumption that investing in better technology will let the industry drill more oil out of the ocean. Sir Ian Wood, a billionaire Scottish oil executive, has called those predictions a “fantasy,” and said that revenues from the North Sea “will simply not be there in 25 to 30 years’ time.” The U.K.’s Office for Budget Responsibility thinks output will be far lower than the nationalists hope.
As the Guardian soberly put it , “oil should be a crucial factor in weighing up how Scots vote on 18 September, but the scale and longevity of the country's fossil fuel wealth remains a matter of debate.”
Many have pointed out that even without its oil revenues, Scotland would be quite a rich country . “If its geographic share of UK oil and gas output is taken into account, Scotland’s GDP per head is bigger than that of France,” Mure Dickey and Keith Fray noted in the Financial Times . “Even excluding the North Sea’s hydrocarbon bounty, per capita GDP is higher than that of Italy.” The country is highly educated and has a strong finance industry along with some advanced manufacturing. Meanwhile, those Scotch exports aren’t a joke .

The problem is taxes. Scotland already gets back more in spending from London than it pays to the government, meaning its revenue base would actually have to grow a bit after independence to avoid running up its deficit or cutting spending. (Letting the deficit pile up isn’t really an option, since the pro-independence movement wants to stay on the British pound .) A major drop in fossil fuel profits would leave a gaping hole in the budget. Over the last few years, oil and gas receipts amounted to a full 16 percent of the region’s tax base , on average. By comparison, the United States only collects about a tenth of its revenue from its entire corporate income tax. Today’s Great Britain gets less than 2 percent of its taxes from oil and gas . The nationalists point out that Scotland would rely less on fossil fuels for revenue than Norway, but that’s cold comfort.
If the crude doesn’t keep flowing the way nationalist politicians hope, it could mean higher taxes, lower spending on social programs, and weaker growth. Worse yet, oil is ultimately just one of many of economic unknowns that could dictate Scotland’s future on its own. (Paul Krugman has already railed on its plans for monetary policy.) Which is why this referendum really is a gamble. In the end, oil money really is as crucial to Scotland’s independence hopes as peat smoke is to its booze—without it, much of the rationale just disappears.

Former CAG Vinod Rai s charges put Manmohan Singh in the dock  BJP seeks answers#manmohan singh #vinod rai #congress #2g spectrum case #2g scam #pm #bjp #sonia gandhi
New Delhi: Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is once again in the dock after ex-Comptroller and Auditor General Vinod Rai made stinging allegations against him in the 2G spectrum case, questioning his integrity as the PM. "Integrity is not just financial; it is intellectual integrity; it is professional integrity. You have an oath of allegiance to the constitution and that is important," Raid said in an interview.
Rai, who is writing a book on his days as head of CAG suggested that Singh was more interested in remaining in power. Being extremely critical of the UPA government, he said his phone was tapped by the Centre and he felt Singh was part of the decisions to allocate 2G telecom spectrum on first-cum-first serve basis and coal blocks without auction.
"...in 2G and coal there is no way he (Singh) can shirk responsibility. In 2G all the letters written by (then telecom Minister) A Raja were to him and he was replying to those letters. I got no reply to any letter I wrote to him.
Rai, who is writing a book on his days as head of CAG suggested that Singh was more interested in remaining in power.
As Rai's revelations sent ripples across the political spectrum and the spotlight was once again on Manmohan Singh, Congress rushed to the defence of the former PM. "So far as the 2G case is concerned, the developments in the telecom sector between 1995 and 2009 were looked at extensively by the joint parliamentary committee. The committee in its report has debunked the theory that was put out by the then CAG. There is nothing that Manmohan Singh has to answer for," said former I&B Minister and Congress leader Manish Tewari.
However, a shocker came from senior party leader Kamal Nath who claimed that he had warned Singh over the 2G spectrum allocations. "I did write a letter to the PM warning him of the allocations in 2G. It is already in the government files," he said.
The Bharatiya Janata Party does not plan to let Congress party breathe easy on the matter. Minister Prakash Javadekar targeted Singh for choosing to ignore his Cabinet colleague's (Kamal Nath) warnings and for allowing scams to happen under his nose, resulting in a huge dent to the country's exchequer.
The party is now demanding Congress to speak up on the matter. "Former CAG Vinod Rai's disclosures are very serious and we demand that the Congress leadership should come forward and reply because the allegations are against the Congress leadership and then Prime Minister," said Javadekar.
"BJP takes serious note of the interview given (to a media organisation) by the former CAG which reveals many things. It establishes our charge that former Prime Minister knew of every scam that happened in the UPA... He cannot plead ignorance. BJP knows very well that the former Prime Minister was in office but not in power. The power was with the party leadership, with 10 Janpath (Sonia Gandhi's residence). This dual centres of has hurt the nation," he added.
Javadekar also termed as "very serious" Rai's allegations that his phone was tapped and three Congress MPs put pressures on him for not naming the former Prime Minister in his report. He rubbished the demand of Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam for a narco test on Rai.

Mercedes-Benz launches E350 at 57.4 lakh onwardsComments
Luxury carmaker Mercedes-Benz on Thursday launched an upper-end variant of its flagship luxury sedan E-Class in diesel version -- E350 -- making it the eighth of the planned 10 launches this year.
With a starting price of Rs. 57.42 lakh (ex-showroom Pune), launch of the E350 marks the revamp of the German giant's E-Class portfolio in the country and is the sixth model to be assembled at its Chakan, Pune facility, managing director and chief executive Eberhard Kern told reporters during the unveiling of the car.
The E-Class portfolio includes the E200, E250 and E350 and E63 AMG, which are available in both diesel and petrol options.
Kern said the new E350 sports a 6-cylinder, 3-litre engine and a host of features and has one of the higher torque, helping the car reach 100 kmph in flat 6.6 seconds.
At present, all its models have petrol variants except the SUVs and over 20 % of the total volume comes from petrol models.
Terming the new E350 as an 'intelligent superpower', Kern said the car combines numerous 'Intelligent drive assistance systems' such a light systems, auto parking assist and attention assist, which will go a long way in ensuring maximum safety.
Kern also said that going forward the company will offer sunroof facility on all models as a standard feature.
The E-Class is not only the largest selling luxury sedan in the country but also the largest selling model for Mercedes-Benz here, having more than 25,000 units on road since its entry in November 1995.
At present, over 30 % of its volume comes from the E-Class, and globally as well it is the largest selling model for the German parent, Kern said, adding, "but it is not as high as in this market." Other new features in the E350 include a 360-degree camera, a panoramic sunroof, Harman Kardon sound system, among others.
With over 25 % growth in sales so far this year, Kern said Merc is the fastest growing luxury automobile brand in the country and expressed confidence that the company could easily meet the target of double digit sales growth this year.
The company had sold 9,003 units last year and if the current sales growth is maintained it could easily sniff at the 11,000-mark this year.
In FY14, the company logged in a whopping 47 % jump in sales at over 9,500 cars in the country.
Mercedes-Benz India product portfolio comprises the locally produced S, E, C, GL and M-Class and the completely built imported models like the A, CLS, SLK-Class and the luxury tourer B-Class, apart from the iconic off-roader G-63 AMG as well as a wide range of other AMG performance cars like the CLA45 AMG, C63 AMG, E63 AMG, SLK55 AMG, GL63 AMG and ML63 AMG.
These models are sold through its 64 outlets spanning across 36 cities. The company will add four more dealers by December, Kern said.
When asked whether sales have declined after the company increased prices by up to 2.5 % citing input cost increase, Kern said, "Absolutely not. The new prices are effective September 1." He said the company will be assembling the CLA-Class locally from next year.
The Chakan plant has an installed capacity of 20,000 units per annum but is highly under-utilised now.

Waiting for govt to walk the talk: MNCsComments
Seeking more clarity on policy and regulation in India, foreign companies on Thursday said the process of doing business in the country would be much easier if bottlenecks are removed, even as the government said it is taking all steps to remove red-tapism.
The world’s second-largest telecom firm Vodafone, which has been facing taxation issues in India, said it was difficult for multinationals to do business in the country because of slow government clearances.
“Yes, it is difficult to do business in India, that’s the general perception I think of foreign companies and that is not just in telecom,” Vodafone India head Marten Pieters said while speaking at the Economist India Summit in the Capital.
“The telecom sector needs more focus,” he added.
Concurring with the perception, BP, Europe’s second-largest oil company, said delays over a decision on natural gas pricing was holding back its investments worth $4 billion (or Rs. 24,000 crore) in India’s oil and gas sector.
“We are ready to go ahead with our first project, which is probably a $4-billion project… we are getting ready to potentially move that forward (but) are waiting for the gas price decision… So is that frustration, yes because it was decided in June 2013,” said Sashi Mukundan, head of BP India and its regional president.
“The PM should set up an energy advisory board... oil and gas in India are still being imported although it has the resources under the ground, $180 billion of oil imports are coming in which may grow to $200-300,” he said.
Amazon India vice-president and MD India Amit Agarwal said opening the e-commerce sector to foreign direct investment would help accelerate India’s $3-billion online retail market.
“The penetration of the Internet market might not be very deep but in absolute numbers, it is huge and is still growing... We are already very successful but FDI would make possible to spin it more aggressively,”  he said.
Amazon, which operates on a marketplace model in India, is betting big on the country and has announced investment of $ 2 billion to expand its operations here.
Highlighting the government’s reform measures, Amitabh Kant, secretary, Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, listed a host of steps the government had taken , such as shifting all applications for industrial licences online, to ease the process of doing business.
“The government has cut out rules, red-tapism and bureaucracy. It is taking steps to ensure fiscal credibility and consolidation, creating smart cities and improving confidence of investors.  It is not against liberalisation of trade policies. It will find the right path between food and trade policy,” he said.
“It is important to concentrate on the breadth of development taking place, rather than the gradual or the incremental growth. Infrastructure will provide maximum jobs and the budget has addressed it,” said Sidharth Birla, president, Ficci.

Catalyse  dont controlIt need not be — must not be a large bunch of experts in the domains in which the country needs to improve.

The future of India’s 64-year-old Planning Commission is a hot topic. The prime minister has declared it dead. He says the country needs another institution, with new capabilities and a new orientation, to set the country in a new direction. What should the shape of this institution be? Its name? He has invited suggestions from the people of India.
A small group within the last Planning Commission (which demitted office in June 2014) had looked around the world for insights that India could apply to a new institution, to processes that other countries are using and have used to accelerate the growth of industry, jobs and infrastructure.
These countries range from Japan in the 1960s and ’70s to Korea in the ’80s and China in the ’90s and early 2000s. They also include the US today, especially the state of California, an entrepreneurial state that is the antithesis of the Soviet Union, from which India adopted the architecture of its central planning systems. Californians have felt an urgent need to improve public infrastructure, such as education, urban and transport infrastructure and the management of water resources. A bipartisan “Think Long Commission” examined the planning practices of other countries, including China, to devise a structure to guide the development of California.
The new institution replacing the Planning Commission cannot carry on trying to coordinate the states and industry with a control mindset and with the (diminishing) authority to allocate money as its source of power. It must play a catalytic role instead. It must learn to deploy processes that spur a system of independent actors — states, private enterprises, civil society — to take a course that will benefit the nation.
A systematic analysis of what India needs today and international best practices suggests that four functions must be the core of the new institution to catalyse development and growth.
One, scenario planning must supplement, perhaps even substitute, five-year resource allocation plans. Scenario planning, based on disciplines of systems thinking, enables all forces, including non-quantifiable social and political forces, to be included in an analysis of the economy. Scenarios are dynamic in the guidance they provide. They are not predictive of precise outcomes but explain the actions stakeholders should take to produce the outcomes they desire.
Two, platforms must be created to connect stakeholders so that they can learn from and coordinate with each other. For example, the states must meet each other in well-designed and well-conducted meetings, in which the Centre plays the role of active facilitator rather than issuer of money and instructions. Similarly, platforms must be created for inter-city learning and for the exchange of ideas between states and regions on how industrial relations can be improved, thereby continued…

Waste of human resources to retire civil servant at 60: Meghnad Desai#human resources #retire #civil servant #meghnad desai #economist #padma bhushan awardee
New Delhi: India-born British economist and Padma Bhushan awardee Lord Meghnad Desai said 60 years of age was too early for civil servants to retire and they should be allowed to continue their services if they are delivering them in a perfect manner.
"It is a total waste of human resource to retire a man at the age of 60 if he is delivering his services in a perfect manner. Why to retire an officer who has vast knowledge of governance and he could deliver his services to the citizenry. This thinking should be stopped," he said.
Desai was delivering a keynote lecture on 'Indian Civil Services and Economic Development of India' here to the officers of Delhi government.
Economist and Padma Bhushan awardee Lord Meghnad Desai said 60 years of age was too early for civil servants to retire.
He also asked the civil servants to get rid of "colonial mentality of mistrust on its citizens".
"They (Civil servants) should get rid of this mentality of mistrust and it should vanish for transactional culture. Only then, they can transform our economy and remove the social disparities to achieve the goal of balanced economy.
"Reduction of social disparity is the need of the hour because by doing so they can bring a social change and give the due rights to OBCs, Dalits and the poorest among poor to bring them and ensuring them social equality," he said.
During his address, Desai also mentioned about how the Chinese civil services failed to meet the challenges of modernisation and fell apart in the 20th century.
"Earlier, it was believed that the Civil Services have the knowledge to guide the citizens and their political bosses to give a new dimension to the society for ensuring social change," he said.
"This is no longer valid..Citizens are less passive, more educated and more demanding. Countries have life cycles - post independence they are in child-phase, they splurge as much as they want. But then they gain maturity and know that they are accountable - and India has now reached that phase.
"Now the state has to confront more intelligent citizenry. And the market has to confront more intelligent state," Desai added.

Apple fails the geography test  again#apple #iphone 6 #canada #maps
Toronto: Geography has again stumped Apple, with the technology company mixing up and relocating both Canada's largest city and its national capital on a map showing when different parts of the country can expect new iPhone deliveries.
Not only did Apple's Canadian website misplace Toronto and Ottawa, it incorrectly placed Edmonton west of Calgary, and missed the apostrophe in St. John's, screen grabs from local media showed. The offending map was quickly removed.
The error prompted a new round of light-hearted digs at the Apple, which has a history of getting lost with its maps.
Geography has again stumped Apple, with the technology company mixing up and relocating both Canada's largest city and its national capital.
"You would think they could've asked Siri for help with that," said Twitter user Jennifer Hoegg, referring to Apple's voice-recognition software.
The latest snafu echoes the launch of Apple Maps, which replaced Google Maps as the default mapping application in 2012 to a chorus of complaints over errors and omissions.
CEO Tim Cook quickly apologised for those problems at the time and took the unusual step of recommending rival services.
The Canadian mishap was unfortunate on the day the smartphone and computer company began taking pre-orders for its iPhone 6 models, which quickly outpaced supply, especially for the Plus version with a larger screen.
Customers might have to wait three to four weeks to get their hands on the iPhone 6 Plus, while most versions of the smaller iPhone 6 should ship between 7 and 10 business days.

Many customers will have to wait three to four weeks to get their hands on Apple Inc's larger screen iPhone 6 Plus after pre-orders for Sept. 19 delivery were booked out within hours.
The smaller 4.7-inch iPhone 6 is still available for delivery on Sept. 19, Apple's website showed.

Websites of Apple's carrier partners, Verizon Wireless, AT&T and Sprint Corp, also showed delays of up to six weeks.
Suppliers to Apple were scrambling to get enough screens ready for the new iPhones as the need to redesign a key component disrupted panel production, supply chain sources told Reuters last month.
It was unclear whether the hiccup could limit the number of phones initially available to consumers, the sources said at the time.
Apple's Chinese customers may also have to wait until the year-end before they can buy the iPhone 6. Apple is yet to set a release date for China, the world's biggest smartphone market.
Apple unveiled its latest iPhones along with a watch and a mobile payments service on Tuesday.

Always taken anti-liquor stand  says Kerala excise minister#kerala #liquor #udf #congress #k babu #vs achuthanandan #kerala government
Thiruvananthapuram: The Congress-led United Democratic Front has always taken an anti-liquor stand to bring in prohibition in a phased manner, Kerala Excise Minister K Babu said on Saturday.
Babu said that the first file he inked after assuming charge as excise minister in 2011 was to cancel the permission given by the outgoing VS Achuthanandan government (2006-11) for opening 14 new retail liquor outlets and since then despite numerous recommendations, not a single new retail outlet had been opened.
Wholesale and retail trade in liquor in Kerala is handled by state-run agencies and there are 383 retail liquor shops. Besides these retail outlets, there are 710 bars in various star categories and 20 five star hotels that have bars.
Wholesale and retail trade in liquor in Kerala is handled by state-run agencies and there are 383 retail liquor shops.
"During the five years of the Achuthanandan government they sanctioned 152 bars, while we gave sanction for 60 bars and another 39 bars was sanctioned after the court directed to do so," Babu said.
He said that the UDF manifesto was loud and clear and it was to achieve prohibition in a phased manner. "And that's what we are up to." A Supreme Court bench of Justice Anil R Dave and Justice UU Lalit this week asked the Kerala High Court to hear a plea by the bar owners who have challenged the Kerala government notification asking them to down shutters. The order was effective September 11 but the apex court said they need not close till September 30.
The apex court directed the state government to file an affidavit Tuesday and the bar owners to file their counter-affidavit Thursday besides directing the High Court not to postpone the case.
"This Tuesday we are filing our affidavit at the Kerala High Court as directed by the Supreme Court in the case that was given by the bar owners association. Every action that we have taken after our government assumed office clearly shows our seriousness that our aim is to achieve prohibition in a phased manner," said Babu.
Babu also pointed out that the government's efforts to achieve total prohibition include reducing the availability of liquor.
"When we assumed office, we reduced the timings of the bars, reduced the maximum stock that a bar can hold at a given time, we saw that statutory warnings are issued in cinema halls with regards to liquor besides running numerous campaigns against liquor," said Babu.
As per the new liquor policy, only five star hotels and the 383 state-owned retail liquor shops will be open, with 10 percent of these retail outlets closing down every year and total prohibition being achieved by Oct 2, 2023.
"We are confident that we have put things in perspective and now we will see what the court has to say," said Babu.

Allow us to donate part of MPLAD fund for J&K: Sitaram Yechury to Hamid Ansari#jammu and kashmir #jammu and kashmir floods #sitaram yechury #hamid ansari #mplad fund #mplad
New Delhi: CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury on Saturday urged Rajya Sabha Chairman Hamid Ansari to permit MPs to donate part of their MPLAD funds for relief and rehabilitation work in flood-ravaged Jammu and Kashmir. In a letter to Ansari, he said, "it has been the usual practice that such a direction is given whenever major national disasters destroy lives and property in various parts of the country.
"Following this practice, I would request you to please instruct the Rajya Sabha Secretariat to permit us to donate part of our MPLAD fund to assist the relief operations."
He said the "MPs who are very concerned and agonised with the plight of people in J and K in the aftermath of the unprecedented floods that have ravaged the state feel that they may be permitted to send a part of their MPLAD fund."
In a letter to Ansari, the CPM leader said, "It has been the usual practice that such a direction is given whenever major national disasters destroy lives and property in various parts of the country."
The Rajya Sabha Secretariat "may decide the upper ceiling of such donations that may be permitted," Yechury said.

India keen to enhance cooperation with Vietnam#india #vietnam #pranab mukherjee #asean #truong tan sang
New Delhi: India is looking to enhance cooperation with Vietnam in defence, security and political arena as there is immense potential for bilateral engagement between the two nations, President Pranab Mukherjee said on Saturday.
The President noted that India-Vietnam partnership has reached a "high point" and is also beneficial to ASEAN and the region beyond. "Political, defence and security cooperation is one of the major pillars of our cooperation. We are of the view that there is much more potential that can be realised in this area and both sides are working towards it along with our regional partners," Mukherjee told Vietnamese News Agency (VNA) on the eve of his departure for a four-day state visit to the country.
Mukherjee, who will meet the top leadership of Vietnam including President Truong Tan Sang, said his trip is aimed at enhancing the mutual goodwill between the two countries and translate it into further mutually beneficial cooperation.
The President noted that India-Vietnam partnership has reached a "high point" and is also beneficial to ASEAN and the region beyond.
"I am confident that our mutual goodwill can be translated into further mutually beneficial cooperation as there is immense potential for future cooperation. Moreover, our partnership is also beneficial to ASEAN and the region beyond.
"During my visit to Vietnam in the coming days, I look forward to strengthening this partnership through discussions with my counterpart His Excellency President Truong Tan Sang and other leaders of Vietnam," he said. The visit, which will take Mukherjee to capital Hanoi and the historical Ho Chi Minh City, is set to witness inking of a number of memorandums between the two countries including one between ONGC Videsh Limited (OVL) and Petro Vietnam with regard to exploration activities in the South China Sea, a move opposed by China.
"Bilateral relations between India and Vietnam  are excellent. They have never been better than what they are on Saturday. Our strategic partnership, which was established in 2007, is now entering its eighth year of implementation. "In recent years, our relations have witnessed a continuous broadening and deepening in all aspects. Our relations are marked by strong mutual trust, understanding, support and a convergence of views on various regional and international issues," he said.
The President said that the foundation of friendship between India and Vietnam laid by former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and President Ho Chi Minh has flourished over the years and has brought us to a "high point today". Lauding Vietnam, Mukherjee said that India has great admiration for the Vietnamese people, their fortitude, courage and for their determination to succeed against odds. He also called the South East Asian nation as an "important pillar" in India's Look East Policy. "Vietnam has been a strategic partner for India both within ASEAN and in the wider region. We deeply appreciate Vietnam's support for India at all regional and international fora and look forward to further deepening this aspect of our cooperation.
"With ASEAN integration acquiring momentum, we have deepened our regional interaction, stepped up initiatives to promote connectivity and expanded people-to-people links to enhance our role in the new era. I see India and Vietnam as partners, contributing to peace, prosperity and stability in the wider region," he said. The President said there was a need to undertake more efforts to bring together the youth force of the two nations.
"There is, however, a gap in information about each other among the younger generations. I understand that both sides are working on increased youth and cultural exchanges including exchange of cultural content, films and television programmes which can address this gap. "I am also happy to note that direct flight services between our two countries will start shortly. This will give a major boost to increased business, tourism and people-to-people contacts," he said.
Mukherjee said that the two countries have a convergence of views and strong cooperation at all regional and international fora. "There is strong mutual support and understanding between us," he said.
The President, who last travelled to the country in 2011 as India's Finance Minister, said there is a lot of potential that remains to be tapped between the two nations in the economic arena. "In economic cooperation too, we have made a lot of progress. Our trade volume has increased almost three and a half times since 2007. We are well on track to meet our trade targets. The prospects for investment cooperation are also bright.
"More and more Indian companies are now looking at Vietnam for doing business. There is a great interest among businessmen for future cooperation and I am confident that with efforts on both sides, we will be able to increase our trade and investment levels several fold, in the years to come," he said.
Talking about science and technology cooperation, the President said there has been good progress in this area but a lot more can still be done. "We have active cooperation in agriculture, health, pharmaceuticals and other sectors. We are cooperating in advanced areas like civil nuclear cooperation and space cooperation. I am confident that these will be strengthened in the coming years.
"In cultural and technical cooperation, I am happy to note that Vietnam is one of the largest recipients of India's Technical and Economic Cooperation Programme (ITEC). We are expanding our education links through the Connect to India programme. Our historical and civilisational linkages are a strong bond and Buddhism closely connects our two countries and peoples," he said.

Maharashtra: Not in the race for CM s post  says NCP leader Supriya Sule#supriya sule #ncp #maharashtra assebly elections 2014 #congress #rahul gandhi #bjp #ajit pawar
Mumbai: NCP leader and MP Supriya Sule on Saturday said that she was not in the race for the post of Maharashtra Chief Minister. "I am not contesting the assembly elections and am not in the race for the Chief Minister's post," Sule said in an interaction at an event organised by a channel. She downplayed a question about why a progressive state like Maharashtra hasn't had a woman chief minister so far.
"That has nothing to do with working for women-related issues and their uplift. Domestic violence and dowry deaths will not stop if a woman becomes CM," she said. To a question about Rahul Gandhi, Sule said the Congress vice president was a simple, well-spoken and good-natured person. "He must have done well in his constituency, that's why he was elected with a margin of two lakh votes," she said.
But asked about Rahul's leadership qualities, she said it was Congress' internal matter. "Even I have lot of drawbacks, who am I to comment on others' flaws? Everyone has his or her own style and personality," she said.
"That has nothing to do with working for women-related issues and their uplift. Domestic violence and dowry deaths will not stop if a woman becomes CM," the NCP leader said.
"It's not NCP's but Congress' job to think about Rahul Gandhi's political credibility. NCP has just an alliance relationship with the Congress," she added. On Narendra Modi, Sule said, "Narendra Modi is very good man, he is our Prime-Minister and we respect him. The country has given him a good mandate so he should be given a little time."
When asked if this statement indicated that NCP had left the door open to a tie-up with BJP in future, she shot back," You asked me about Modi as an individual. Political stand should not be confused (with views about a person)." About seat-sharing talks with Congress, she said NCP had demanded equal number of seats. "Let's see what happens," she said.
Talking about her party's debacle in the Lok Sabha polls, Sule said, "We are not haunted by the ghost of Lok Sabha results. We take exams to succeed, however the Lok Sabha results were a good warning." Sule, who represents Baramati in the Lok Sabha, also claimed that recently-announced reservations for Marathas and Muslims in Maharashtra was not a votebank politics. "I am a Maratha but my children will not benefit by reservation because there is a creamy-layer (barring) provision."
Asked between her and her cousin and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar who would inherit her father Sharad Pawar's political legacy, Sule said, "It could be me, my brother or somebody else. Only time will tell. Inheritance of legacy happens not just through blood relation but the work done by the person. My father carried forward the legacy of the state's first Chief Minister, Yashwantrao Chavan, though he was not related to Chavan."
