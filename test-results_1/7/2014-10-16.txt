Loopholes in BCCI s chucking policyTweet
0
Akshar Patel.Vishal Dabholkar was the most successful spinner in the 2013-14 Ranji Trophy, with 39 wickets in nine games at an average of 26.76. Still, the Mumbai left-arm spinner was overlooked for the West Zone Duleep Trophy squad. If his omission wasn't intriguing on its own, then on Monday when Akshar Patel was asked to join the national team, the Gujarat left-arm spinner was replaced with Dabholkar's Mumbai team-mate Iqbal Abdulla .
No doubt Abdulla's record of 15 wickets in three games at 12.80 in the previous Ranji season was impressive but the fact remains that he was not the first-choice spinner for Mumbai. It is what makes Dabholkar's exclusion all the more intriguing. The truth is that there is a possibility that his could be the fallout of a letter he received during the off-season from the BCCI.
Dabholkar was taken aback when he received the letter saying he was "cleared" from a suspect action. He had, in fact, never reported by match officials throughout the last season. It is understood that the BCCI's specialist panel appointed for tracking suspect actions found a couple of Dabholkar's deliveries during Mumbai's Ranji quarter-final against Maharashtra to be suspicious but he was subsequently cleared since the flex was miniscule and well within the accepted limits.
Mumbai cricket is abuzz with the idea that the letter concerning an action that was first suspected and then cleared, is what may have cost Dabholkar a place in the Duleep squad. It would be an unfortunate turn of events. But the fact that the three-member specialist committee formed to identify illegal actions and pull up chuckers in Indian cricket remains vigilant is a welcome sign.
Ratnakar Shetty, the BCCI's general manager - game development, confirmed that the panel is authorised to report bowlers who have not been reported by match officials, which is what may have happened in Dabholkar's case. "Since there have been too many marginal cases, those which the on-field umpires were not sure to report with what they saw with the naked eye, the expert panel has been deciding whether to test bowlers based on footage from games," Shetty said.
The panel comprises S Venkataraghavan, the former India captain and ICC Elite Panel umpire, former Test umpire AV Jayaprakash and Javagal Srinath, the former India fast bowler who is now an ICC Match Referee.
The Champions League Twenty20 saw match officials reporting several overseas bowlers and suspending one of them from bowling further in India unless he is cleared by the BCCI panel. The crackdown on bowlers with suspect actions continued during last week's Under-19 zonal one-day leagues.
There were nine cases of bowlers reported for suspect action and they were asked to undergo tests at the newly set-up facility at Sri Ramachandra Medical College in Chennai, recently accredited by the ICC as an official testing centre for suspect actions. The CLT20 and ICC crackdown may have brought the issue of chuckers to centrestage only recently, the BCCI's campaign against illegal actions has been on for the last five years.
In an effort to improve umpiring standards, the BCCI started recording every match of the U-19, U-22 (now U-23) and senior category with its own six-camera set-up five years ago. Experts realized that chuckers were rampant in domestic cricket and the board appointed the Venkataraghavan panel to handle the problem.
Almost two-third of the bowlers in the first list of 130 were part-timers. For instance, Mohammad Kaif and Y Venugopal Rao , both of whom have represented India as batsmen, were found to be bowling with suspect actions during their rare spells in the 2009-10 season. Over the last five years, the ratio has tilted with at least half of the 35 reported last season being specialist bowlers.
Shetty attributed the dip to the Venkataraghavan panel's good work. He also said that besides encouraging umpires to report bowlers with suspect actions, the panel has been pulling up officials who fail to do so. "If the panel notices a bowler with dicey action who has not been reported, the panel not only asks the bowler to get tested but also recommends action against the umpires and referees who have failed to report the bowler," Shetty said. "The BCCI then sends a show-cause notice to such officials and takes a call based on their reply."
A BCCI panel umpire admitted that the confidence given to them by the committee has resulted in more vigilance. The problem has been tackled more efficiently at the junior level, he said. "Identifying the problem at a young age is important. If that can be done efficiently, we can tackle the problem efficiently," Shetty said.
Maharashtra fast bowler Sachin Chaudhari, who was barred from bowling last year after being called thrice in a Ranji match, went through the rigorous correction process during the off-season. "I had been working on correcting the action since I was called last season and it was heartening to see my action wasn't deemed illegal in Chennai," Chaudhari said. "It was a sigh of relief and I hope I can return to first-class cricket soon."
For Chaudhari to have been suspended from bowling early in his first-class career was a huge jolt. "At that time, I was very disturbed. Thankfully, the coaches and team-mates have been very supportive. Even the selectors have picked me in the probables this year, so I hope I will never have to live with the tag of being a chucker."
It took Chaudhari more than eight months to be tested after being called. Chaudhari was fortunate to have received expert advice from his home association. But for bowlers who get confused and start getting demoralised, the BCCI needs to enhance its drive with quicker testing and remedial processes.

18 dead as Hudhud tail stings UP with heavy rains18 dead as Hudhud tail stings UP with heavy rains
Agencies  Lucknow, October 15, 2014
First Published: 18:28 IST(15/10/2014) | Last Updated: 19:25 IST(15/10/2014)

The tail of Cyclone Hudhud lashed Uttar Pradesh with heavy rains over the last two days, leaving 18 people dead and causing widespread destruction, officials said on Wednesday.
Lucknow alone received 61.1 mm of rainfall on Tuesday, leaving vast areas in the capital waterlogged while gusty winds snapped powerlines, plunging large areas into darkness.
Tuesday’s rainfall erased the single-day rainfall record of 46.1 mm dating back to October 7, 2009. 
The unseasonal rains were attributed to the effects of Cyclone Hudhud which had hit the coastal states of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha on Sunday, leaving a trail of death and destruction.
Though the tropical storm lost much of its intensity as it moved inland, Hudhud still retained enough of the moisture it had sucked out of Bay of Bengal to dump heavy rains in Uttar Pradesh as well as neighbouring Bihar.
A state government spokesperson confirmed the 18 deaths, adding that many houses were damaged and standing crops destroyed in the eastern part of the state.
Though the rains eased on Wednesday, the effects of Hudhud was expected to be felt for the next two days, JP Gupta, the regional met director, said. 
Many low-lying localities in Lucknow alongwith the Charbagh railway station, Thakurganj, Indiranagar, Gomtinagar, Chowk, Sitapur Road, Aliganj were water-logged, officials said.
The maximum rains recorded since Tuesday was in Gorakhpur which received as much as 142.1 mm in a single day with wind speed touching 83 kmph. 
Allahabad and Varanasi too witnessed heavy rainfall.
The wet weather also brought down the mercury across the state with day temperatures falling by as much as 10 degree Celsius in Lucknow to 22.5 degrees on Tuesday.
In neighbouring Bihar, three people were killed and 50 injured as heavy rain lashed the state, authorities said Wednesday.
An official of the state disaster management department said one person was killed each in Muzaffarpur, Madhubani and Darbhanga districts on Tuesday.
The remnants of Hudhud hit Nepal hard on Wednesday, triggering snowfall and avalanches which killed at least 24 people including foreigners.

No shortage of funds for bankable projects  says SBM chiefNo shortage of funds for bankable projects, says SBM chief
BS Reporter | Bangalore Oct 15, 2014 08:43 PM IST
Banks are committed to meet financial requirements of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and there is no shortage of funds for bankable projects, said Sharad Sharma, Managing Director, State Bank of Mysore (SBM).
“Despite their important role in economy, MSMEs have remained largely ignored. It was a matter of concern that a large number of small and micro units continue to depend on non-formal sector for meeting their financing requirements,” Sharma said after inaugurating a convention on micro, small and medium enterprises, organised by Assocham.
Speaking on the theme of the convention, “Funding MSMEs to stimulate growth”, he said there was a need to enhance coverage under the CGTMSE scheme, which is being implemented through SIDBI.
“We need to enhance coverage under the scheme so that more and more micro and small enterprises may be helped. Under the scheme, banks extend credit without asking for any collateral,” Sharma said.
He pointed out that very often small enterprises are not able to prepare and present their financial statements in time thereby creating problem for bankers while assessing demand for enhanced financing requirements. He urged entrepreneurs to ensure that their documents and statements are furnished in time to avail timely credit from banks.
Responding to concerns raised by delegates, Sharma said any loan application made to commercial banks is not rejected at the first stage itself without proper examination.
Speaking on the occasion K Sathianandan, General Manager, SIDBI said that SIDBI provides long term finance to MSMEs to meet their requirements on very nominal terms.
Highlighting the fact that SIDBI was the only Development Bank available in the country for helping small and medium units, Sathianandan said that SIDBI was committed to provide crucial support to entrepreneurs. He urged delegates to take advantage of various schemes available for small entrepreneurs.
The Convention was organised to highlight the various options available for meeting financing requirements of MSMEs. Delegates at the Convention highlighted problems faced by them in raising finance from banks while bankers explained the constraints faced by them while appraising loan applications.
In his address P Ravikumar, Zonal General Manager, NSIC gave an overview of schemes offered by NSIC to help small and micro enterprises.
J Crasta, Co-Chairman, Assocham Southern Regional Council said that the industry was looking forward to new policy for MSMEs. He said only 22 per cent of credit demand of MSMEs was met through formal sources. Rest was being met either through personal sources of entrepreneurs or through informal sources.

SpiceJet set to disconnect Mysore airportSpiceJet set to disconnect Mysore airport
BS Reporter | Mysore Oct 15, 2014 08:44 PM IST
SpiceJet is withdrawing its services to Mysore with effect from October 26.
It had earlier decided to stop its operations to Mysore connecting Bangalore and Chennai. But, following the government’s intervention on the demand by stakeholders, it extended its operations in view of the Dasara celebrations. Now that the Dasara festivities are over, it is cancelling its operations again.
Mysore-Kodagu MP Pratap Simha said today that SpiceJet was withdrawing services due to poor potential. He was speaking to reporters after hearing grievances from public at his ‘Janaspandana’ programme.
The lone flight operator to link Mysore with Bangalore, thus providing air connectivity to other places, had earlier announced the cancellation of its flight between September 5 and October 31 citing operational reasons though the response from the local passengers was good.
However, on the plea by Tourism Minister R V Deshpande and Pratap Simha, following the plea by local stakeholders, SpiceJet continued with its operations.
On previous occasions too, it had discontinued its services from July 28. But, it had decided to permanently stop the service from September 1. Following the intervention of Union Civil Aviation Ministers Ashok Gajapathi Raju and G M Siddeshwar, who had inspected the Mandakalli airport, the expansion of which is facing prolonged delays, it had resumed services within 10 days of its cancellation.
Simha had urged the state government to provide the land required for the airport’s expansion for landing bigger aircraft. Rejecting the idea for constructing an underpass saying it would not be feasible, the MP said the Mysore-Nanjangud highway should be shifted at this point.

Black money: Swiss to provide info in a time-bound mannerBlack Money
(In a major breakthrough…)
BERNE/NEW DELHI: In a major breakthrough in India's fight against black money allegedly stashed abroad, Switzerland today said it will examine Indian requests for banking information on a priority basis and provide requested details in a time-bound manner.
The Swiss authorities would also "assist in obtaining confirmation on genuineness of bank documents on request by the Indian side and also swiftly provide information on requests related to non-banking information".
"... the Swiss competent authority will provide the Indian side with the requested information in a time-bound manner or else indicate the reasons why the cases cannot be answered within the agreed timeline," a Swiss-Indian joint statement said after a high-level meeting between the official of the two countries on tax matters.
The meeting took place in Berne between Revenue Secretary Shaktikanta Das and his Swiss counterpart, State Secretary for International Financial Matters, Jacques de Watteville.
They discussed various bilateral and multilateral tax and financial issues and also agreed on continuing the dialogue between the two countries, a statement from Swiss government said.
Das stressed on the high priority given by India to tackling tax evasion, while the top officials of the two countries also welcomed the recent developments in the field of international taxation, including the new international standard for automatic exchange of information (AEOI) and the BEPS (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting).
They also "reaffirmed their countries' commitment to combating tax fraud and evasion within the applicable legal framework".
There has been a huge political uproar over huge amounts of black money allegedly stashed by Indians in Swiss banks and the new government has maintained that it would make all efforts to tackle this menace.
As per Swiss National Bank's latest data, the total money held by Indians in Swiss banks stood at over Rs 14,000 crore as on December 2013, up by nearly 42 per cent from a year ago.
Today's meeting, which assumes significance in the wake of Switzerland repeatedly rejecting India's requests for information on so-called HSBC list, followed a Swiss delegation's visit to New Delhi in February 2014 and was the first high-level meeting between the two countries' tax and financial authorities since the new Indian government took up office in May this year.
India has sought information on bank accounts and other details of the persons named in this list, but Switzerland has been refusing to cooperate saying these names were obtained "illegally" or through sale of stolen data by a hacker.
With regard to the application of the Swiss-Indian Double Taxation Agreement as revised by the Protocol of August 30 2010, both sides acknowledged the progress achieved in the bilateral cooperation between the two countries while noting there were still ongoing discussions on certain issues.
  Das and Watteville reaffirmed their respective positions in this regard, while the Swiss officials "indicated that Switzerland would be willing to examine requests for which investigations have been carried out independently from what the Swiss government considers as data obtained in breach of Swiss law.
Adrian Hug, Director of the Swiss Federal Tax Administration, agreed that the Swiss competent authority would assist in obtaining confirmation of the genuineness of bank documents on request by the Indian side and also swiftly provide information on requests related to non-banking information.
"In order to deal expeditiously with pending cases, Das agreed to indicate to the Swiss competent authority which cases should be dealt with as a matter of priority and to give additional information where appropriate.
"On this basis, the Swiss competent authority will provide the Indian side with the requested information in a time-bound manner or else indicate the reasons why the cases cannot be answered within the agreed timeline.
The Swiss government said that the Das and Watteville also discussed "bilateral and multilateral topics related to fiscal and financial matters".
"Noting with satisfaction the strong economic ties linking India and Switzerland, they agreed that the ongoing dialogue between the two countries offers a great opportunity of working together in the future," the joint statement said.
"As a matter of principle, the Revenue Secretary (of India) and State Secretary (of Switzerland) decided that the competent authorities of the two countries should continue their regular consultations to come up with effective and pragmatic solutions agreeable to both sides in accordance with their legal order and international obligations.
"Das and Watteville acknowledged AEOI as an effective instrument to tackle tax fraud and evasion on a global scale. They recalled that India belongs to the group of the early adopters.

Greek stocks in tailspinBy Ben Rooney   @ben_rooney October 15, 2014: 12:08 PM ET
Greek stocks plunge on concerns about banks, political instability.
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
Greek stocks went into a free fall after ratings agency Fitch issued a warning about its banks at a time when the country is already on the verge of a political crisis.
The benchmark stock index in Athens fell over 10% before recovering a little to close down 6.25% on Wednesday. Shares of Greek banks were among the hardest hit, with the National Bank of Greece ( NBG ) falling as much as 13% at one point.
The selloff came after Fitch said Greek banks remain fragile despite improving their balance sheets and showing progress on restructuring plans. The ratings agency said upcoming stress tests by the European Central Bank could show additional shortfalls because of problem loans at various banks, including National Bank of Greece, Piraeus, Eurobank and Alpha.
The warning comes in the midst of political uncertainty. The Greek government could face early elections in February if lawmakers cannot agree on a candidate for president soon.
There is also fears that Greece won't be able to exit its bailout agreement with the International Monetary Fund ahead of schedule, as some officials had hoped.

Costs to borrow climbed sharply, with the yield on Greece's 10-year bond rising to 7% Tuesday, the highest level since March.
It's been a rough day for stocks across Europe. Stocks in Germany and France were down more than 2%, while the market in London declined 1.7%.
U.S. markets also opened sharply lower , with the Dow Jones industrial average falling more than 350 points after the opening bell. The selling abated, but shares on Wall Street remain under pressure.
Overall, investors have been rattled by a host of ongoing concerns, from the spread of Ebola and the conflict in Syria, to signs of a global economic slowdown and uninspiring corporate earnings.

BS Reporter | Ahmedabad Oct 15, 2014 08:56 PM IST
With plans to set up a manufacturing unit at Sanand in Ahmedabad district, Taiwanese tyre maker Maxxis Group president Dr. Wally Chen called upon Gujarat chief minister Anandiben Patel on Wednesday.
The company, which is one of the suppliers to Maruti Suzuki and Honda, evinced interest for setting up a tyre manufacturing plant worth Rs 400 crore during its meeting with the CM, Gujarat government sources stated.
Sources added that the company will need around 35 acres of land and will soon begin formal application process with the state government for a greenfield tyre manufacturing plant. “The company has zeroed in on land in Sanand and the state government has assured extension of all kind of support,” sources further stated.
A meeting was held between Patel and Maxxis Group’s president Dr. Wally Chen. According to an official communique from the state government, the CM welcomed the Maxxis Group for setting a manufacturing unit at Sanand in Ahmedabad district.

The arrival of the Maxxis group in Gujarat would be mutually benefitting as the tyre manufacturing unit will provide employment to local youths and at the same it time the local small scale units will play supportive role to the US giant, Patel said.
Assuring the company of total cooperation from her government Patel invited Chen to visit ‘Vibrant Gujarat Summit 2015’ to be held here in January 2015 in Gandhinagar.

Google unveils  Lollipop  Android system  ne...Google unveils 'Lollipop' Android system, new devices
By AFP | 16 Oct, 2014, 12.39AM IST
Google also announced launch of a streaming media player for music, movies & videos, which can also allow users to play games via Android TV device.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
WASHINGTON: Google on Wednesday ramped up its mobile arsenal, upgrading its Nexus line with a new tablet and smartphone, and unveiling its revamped Android software, to be dubbed "Lollipop."
The US tech giant also announced the launch of a streaming media player for music, movies and videos, which can also allow users to play games via the Android TV device.
"Lollipop" or Android 5.0, the upgraded operating system for mobile, "is designed to be flexible, to work on all your devices and to be customized for you the way you see fit," said Google vice president Sundar Pichai , who heads the Android operations.
With the new operating system, according to the Android Website, "The songs, photos, apps, and even recent searches from one of your Android devices can be immediately enjoyed across all of your Android devices."
The new devices give Google and its Android partners a broader portfolio to compete against Apple , which launched two upgraded large-screen iPhones last month and is expected to unveil new iPads on Thursday.
The Nexus 6 smartphone becomes the newest and largest of the Google-branded handsets, and is produced by Motorola , which Google bought in 2012 and is in the process of selling to China's Lenovo.
This aluminum frame device has a six-inch high resolution screen and a 13-megapixel camera.
"The large screen is complemented by dual front-facing stereo speakers that deliver high-fidelity sound, making it as great for movies and gaming as it is for doing work," Google said in a statement.
"It also comes with a Turbo Charger, so you can get up to six hours of use with only 15 minutes of charge."
On the tablet front, Google partnered with Taiwan-based HTC for the 8.9-inch Nexus 9.
The brushed-metal tablet "is small enough to easily carry around in one hand, yet big enough to work on," Google said.
"And since more and more people want to have the same simple experience they have on their tablets when they have to do real work, we designed a keyboard folio that magnetically attaches to the Nexus 9, folds into two different angles and rests securely on your lap like a laptop."
Google did not disclose pricing for the devices, but said they would be available for pre-order later this month.
The media player will deliver video apps to a television screen for consumers looking to supplement or go without cable or satellite.
Some of the apps included on the player are Netflix , Hulu Plus , the Food Network , Pandora and The Huffington Post.

Exit polls give BJP the thumbs-up in Maharashtra  HaryanaComments
At least three exit polls put the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead but short of a clear majority in Maharashtra and Haryana on Wednesday, a ringing endorsement of the so-called 'Modi magic' that may have helped the party come into its own in the two politically crucial states.

A fourth survey by Today's Chanakya, which correctly predicted the results of the Lok Sabha polls this year, gave the party a clear majority in both states.
The projections, if true, could touch off a round of intense haggling between the party and its estranged allies - the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra and Haryana Janhit Congress (HJC) - for control of the two states that the Congress has led for more than a decade, either on its own or with its partners.
Read: Poll trends set off early Diwali for BJP
A BJP victory will reaffirm Modi's appeal among voters and silence detractors of his new party leadership, which was blamed for a string of defeats in recent by-elections that tempered the euphoria of his Lok Sabha triumph.
Modi campaigned extensively for the state elections, addressing 27 rallies in Maharashtra and 11 in Haryana in a bid to prop up the BJP's fortunes after the by-election losses.
A Times Now-C Voter poll predicted the BJP would bag 129 of 288 seats in the politically crucial state of Maharashtra despite the falling apart of its 25-year-old association with the Shiv Sena, which was projected to win in 56 constituencies. Times Now-C Voter predicted 37 seats for the BJP in the 90-member Haryana assembly.
An ABP-Nielsen poll predicted 144 seats for the BJP and 77 for the Sena, while an India Today-Cicero exit poll saw the BJP winning 124 seats in Maharashtra. The poll says the Shiv Sena will be the second largest gainer in Maharashtra with 71 seats.
The polls did not bring any cheer to the Congress party, already relegated to the political sidelines since its bruising defeat in the Lok Sabha polls.
The Times Now-C Voter poll said the Congress was likely to win 43 seats in Maharashtra while ABP-Nielsen said it will bag just 30 seats. In Haryana, Times Now-C Voter gave the Congress 15 seats and ABP-Nielsen poll predicted the country's main opposition party will get 10 seats.
Today's Chanakya predicted a clear majority of 151 seats for the BJP in Maharashtra and 52 in Haryana. Today's Chanakya was on the money when it predicted a 300-plus sweep for the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the Lok Sabha elections.
For the Congress, a poor result will possibly stoke further murmurs against Rahul Gandhi's leadership.
If the outcome on Sunday's judgement day matches the predictions, it would mean the Congress would have to carry forward with its restructuring process to script a turnaround in the face of a saffron surge.
Haryana saw a high turnout of 75.9%, while Maharashtra registered a turnout of  63.4% in the elections seen as a test of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popularity since he stormed to power in May and the BJP's strategy to abandon long-standing allies in the states.
The elections were mainly peaceful except for minor clashes between workers of the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), BJP and others in Haryana.
Analysts said the BJP had benefited from anger towards the Congress party, which has held power in Maharashtra for 15 years and Haryana for a decade. Both chief ministers, Prithviraj Chavan in Maharashtra and Bhupinder Hooda in Haryana, battled strong anti-incumbency with corruption being a major poll issue.
Read: Nearly 64% vote in Maharashtra, highest-ever 76% turnout in Haryana
The BJP took a big gamble on its popularity and campaigned alone in both states.
It was in contention for power for the first time in Haryana, where it was a junior partner in the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) government in 2000. Similarly in Maharashtra, the BJP had so far played second fiddle to the Shiv Sena, which led the coalition government in the state from 1995 to 1999. The Congress-NCP alliance ruled the state for 15 years from 1999.
In case of a hung verdict, the shaping up of new political alliances promises to be another interesting chapter following the high-stakes elections.

Google unveils Android Lollipop and latest Nexus devicesGoogle unveils Android Lollipop and latest Nexus devices
By James O'Toole   @jtotoole October 15, 2014: 3:28 PM ET
 
Check out Google's new Android L
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
The latest version of Android is almost here.
Google ( GOOGL , Tech30 ) announced Wednesday that the new version of its Android mobile operating system, nicknamed "Lollipop," will be available on select mobile devices within the next few weeks.
Lollipop will first be available on the Nexus 6, a new phone developed with Motorola that hits stores in November. It will also be available on the new Nexus 9 tablet from HTC and the Nexus Player, a gaming and streaming media device from Asus.
The software will follow shortly on other Nexus-branded devices, as well as a handful of "Google Play edition" phones. Those phones, from companies like Samsung and HTC, run Google's pure version of Android without any of the typical bells and whistles that phone makers add to make their phones stand out against their rivals.
Google previewed Lollipop at its software developer conference earlier this year.
The software is designed to work across all your devices, from smartphones to tablets to TVs, storing your information and allowing you to pick up wherever you left off on a previous screen -- even if it was on a different gadget. It allows for multiple user accounts on a single device, as well as custom notifications for specific contacts.
Lollipop also has a cleaned-up look that Google calls "material design," which gives the illusion of varying depths of perspective for images on the screen. It also allows users to set up a "personal unlocking" system in which the phone won't require a passcode when it senses that it's in a trusted location or detects your Bluetooth-enabled wearable devices.
There's no word yet on when Lollipop will be available for the wider world of Android devices, but expect it to be available in the coming months as hardware makers incorporate it into their designs.
Related: Google rejects 58% of 'right to be forgotten' requests
The Nexus gadgets aren't usually big sellers, but they're popular among Android enthusiasts who like to tinker with their devices and don't want to deal with software skins from phone manufacturers.
For Google, the Nexus line is a chance to display what it sees as the ideal hardware complements for Android and set an example for manufacturers.
The Nexus 6 phone comes with a massive 6-inch screen, a 13-megapixel camera and dual front-facing stereo speakers. The charger gives you six hours of use after just fifteen minutes, or 24 hours from a full charge.
The Nexus 9 tablet from HTC comes with an 8.9-inch screen and an attachable magnetic keyboard that lets you rest the device on your lap like a laptop. The Nexus Player, meanwhile, is a set-top box along the lines of Roku or Apple TV that offers a browsing interface for TV and streaming video apps and also supports Google Play Games.

Treasury yields tumble over 7%  prices soarTreasury yields tumble, bond prices soar

Yields on Treasury securities plunged Wednesday as investors sought a safe haven from the stock market rout, and traders realized that the global economy is entering another slowdown.
USA TODAY
The yield on the bellwether 10-year Treasury note fell as low as 1.873%, the lowest since May 2013, before settling at 2.13%. And the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell below 3%, to 2.92%. Other government bond yields plunged as well:
French 10-year government bond: 1.13%
German 10-year government bond: 0.75%
Japanese 10-year government bond: 0.48%
“Two percent looks sky-high compared to Germany,” says John Lonski, Team Managing Director of the Economics Group at Moody’s Analytics. “The bond market is finally pricing in the reality of indefinite subpar growth for aging advanced economies.”
Why the bond rally? Investors look for safety from government bonds in times of crisis. And currently, investors fear losing money through falling prices — deflation — rather than through rising prices, or inflation.
The specter of deflation is haunting the markets. Oil prices have plunged to four-year lows on lower demand and bountiful production. The implied inflation rate for the next 30 years, based on 30-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, is just 2.09%. For the next 10 years, the implied inflation rate is 1.85%.
Even in China, one of the world’s most rapidly growing economies, inflation is a low 1.6% — primarily because of stagnating wages. “Chinese wages are going nowhere,” Lonski says.
And signs of slowdown in the U.S. point to deflation, not inflation. Despite rock-bottom mortgage rates, for example, the 52-week average of the Mortgage Bankers’ index of home buyers’ applications is at the lowest since March 1996, Lonski says. Baby Boomers, once a driving force in the economy, are spending less — partly because those who have lost their jobs in the past five years must settle for sharply lower wages. “They’re going to get contract jobs and do the same work they did previously at lower wages,” Lonski says.
The plunge in bond yields means that the Federal Reserve could delay raising rates until late in 2015, and could even be tempted to embark on another stimulus program. From the Fed’s point of view, an outburst of inflation would be far easier to combat than widespread deflation.
The Fed can attack inflation by raising rates, but it has little room to push rates down further. “There are not a lot a lot of bullets left if things get worse,” says Bill Irving, portfolio manager of Fidelity Government Income fund.
The bonus for the worried: When bond yields fall, bond prices rise. For example, iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (ticker: TLT), soared 2.4% early Wednesday, before settling at a 0.76% gain, says Morningstar. The 10-year T-note yield has fallen nearly a full percentage point since the end of 2013, when it yielded 3.03%. Investors in the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond have seen their shares soar 16.5% this year.
And, says Irving, mortgage rates are headed south again. Quicken Loans posted a 3.875% rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, Irving notes, making this a good time to refinance a high-rate mortgage.

Fear levels on Wall Street spiked to their highest levels in almost three years today, as spooked investors reacted to another rollercoaster ride that pushed the Dow down more than 400 points.
Dubbed, the VIX, the fear gauge shot up 36% today to an intraday high of 31.06, its highest level and first climb above the 30 level, since December 2011.
When the VIX skyrockets, it is a sign that investors are spending more to “insure” their stock portfolios from steeper losses. Basically, it means that market players are buying options contracts that protects them from losses in the market.
Check out this daily chart, courtesy of Yahoo Finance, of the VIX today. It screams F E A R.

Badminton + Joanie + a Talking CatPersona, like other fiction-writing apps, helps you organize your ideas to enhance productivity.

Microsoft Word can sometimes feel like the place where creativity goes to die. Its icons evoke the wan cubicle world of ’90s office culture: impassive clipboards, boring scissors, a squat dour printer. (And don’t get me started on Google Docs.) Word’s corporate vibe makes it a less-than-ideal sanctum for novel writing, or really any kind of imaginative writing, and perhaps that’s why a new crop of apps has emerged to help today’s underserved Woolfs and Melvilles find literary greatness.
Katy Waldman
Katy Waldman is a Slate staff writer. 
The fiction-writing app is a curious creature, because it can only sell creativity by downgrading it. It operates outside of the traditional, mystery-swathed model of inspiration, in which brilliance floods down on us from heaven, and instead reduces invention to a series of steps. In lassoing and regimenting the muse, fiction apps evaporate some of writing’s pain, but also some of its glory. Or maybe they just help us procrastinate! Either way, we’ve rounded up a few of the digital aides available to seekers of literary immortality as well as those of you who really, really hate Word.
A Novel Idea gives you a sketchbook where you can fill in your story’s title (“The Death of the Author”), setting (“Katy’s iPhone”), theme (“murder”), tone (“noir”), point of view (“third person”), premise (“Someone killed the author.”), and basic plot (“The author turns up dead …”). Then, you move on to creating individual scenes—filling in backstory, character names and descriptions, and location and atmospherics as needed. The app stores every locale and character you enter in a dropdown menu for easy insertion as the story progresses, and there’s a free-floating “ideas” window that you can call up for brainstorming. Oh, and there’s also a window at the bottom of the screen to type into when you want to actually start writing, though when I took the app for a test drive I was so enchanted by all the fun preliminary steps that I never got around to using it. (It turns out that listing every swerve in your character’s high school dating history is a lot more enticing than producing sentences to go in your novel.)

Similar to A Novel Idea is yWriter5 , the brainchild of designer, programmer, and science-fiction author Simon Haynes. This free program cordons your opus into discrete chapters, each of which you can annotate with four types of metadata: “character(s),” “goal,” “conflict,” and “outcome.” Drag and drop chapters around a “storyboard” to get a visual sense of the overall structure and, for a healthy dose of stress, set yourself a deadline with reminders of what needs to get accomplished every day.

The Persona app allows you to generate a freestanding database of possible cast members in order to “organize and centralize your character data” around “archetypes” you’ve designed. You might, for example, make a folder full of buxom blond ex-wives, or exacting-but-warmhearted teachers, or quirky anomic Brooklynite twentysomethings, or struggling tech-savvy genius authors who use Persona.
Got writer's block? Take a trip through Lists for Writers.
Screenshot of Lists For Writers
Lists for Writers has a slightly different goal: dispelling writer’s block. The app consists of lots of lists dreamed up and populated by its creators: You can browse through male and female names, articles of clothing, occupations, personality traits (including phobias and philias), hobbies, “seven basic plots,” and “36 dramatic situations.” “Lists for Writers relieves some of the mental burden of generating possibilities from scratch,” its site says. If that sounds lazy, think of the app as a magician’s hat out of which you can pull random ideas to weave together into a story. Where might “Florida” + “clairvoyance” + “eggplant” + “vengeance taken upon kin for kin” take you? What about “badminton” + “Joanie” + “a talking cat”? If popular literature takes a decisive turn toward wacky experimentalism over the next few years, thank Lists for Writers (as well as Donald Barthelme ).
Then there are the apps that aim to tighten and sparkle up your prose. Hemingway will kill your darlings until each sentence is bold and clear enough to satisfy Papa—it highlights adverbs, unnecessarily flashy words (such as “utilize” for “use”), and instances of passive voice. Long, rambling sentences get shown in yellow; very intricate and complex clauses characterized by repetitiveness and awkward phrasing are bathed in a haze of red as if to put the writer’s inner pilot on alert that an imminent stop is required—though if you persist through the red to see if the furious ghost of Hemingway eventually appears to admonish you for unconscionable verbosity, you will discover that, unfortunately, it does not. I checked.
One worry with apps like these is that they will produce uninspired cookie-cutter novels. Should writing be easy? Composing by numbers, or by consulting a dropdown menu, seems destined to result in a clanky product, not a living thing. Then again, I am invoking the notion that creation (what God, a parent, or an artist does) is different from production (what a factory does). Maybe that binary is ripe for dissolution, as Andy Warhol demonstrated for visual art in the ’60s! Or maybe the answer is an interface that, despite its pragmatic, process-based hacks, takes a gloriously open-ended approach to content.
Enter Scrivener . A lot of writers I reached out to love Scrivener. “It’s excellent. Can’t recommend it enough,” says Jeff Wilser, who used the app to write his forthcoming book The Good News About What’s Bad for You … and the Bad News About What’s Good for You . It’s “not one of those punitive, God-will-condemn—no, embarrass—you-if-you-don’t-write apps,” says Melinda Salata, an English teacher in Bethesda, Maryland. In 2008, Scrivener earned a rapturous review from Virginia Heffernan in the New York Times. “The happy, broad-minded, process-friendly Scrivener software encourages note-taking and outlining and restructuring and promises all the exhilaration of a productive desk: ‘a ring-binder, a scrapbook, a corkboard, an outliner and text editor all rolled into one,’ ” Heffernan wrote.
What exactly is Scrivener? It’s not an app that will ply you with “36 dramatic situations” or stipulate that every scene have a “goal,” “conflict,” and “outcome.” It won’t steer you toward clichéd dramatis personae or bind you to a single “tone” or “premise” or take your adverbs out back and shoot them. It is essentially a writer’s studio where you can store drafts and research, craft outlines, and organize your thoughts. Like yWriter and A Novel Idea, it breaks long documents into manageable pieces that you can then move around. (Unlike yWriter and A Novel Idea, it costs $45.) The “Inspector” button lets you toggle to a layout that represents each section you’ve created as a single notecard, inscribed with whatever summary or information you care to provide. Scrivener saves feverishly so you don’t have to and opens out into a distraction-zapping, cosmologically magnificent full-screen mode that is commensurate with your writerly ambition. “I can’t imagine writing anything without it,” kvelled Thorin Klosowski in Lifehacker. (The grandiosely named Ulysses app is a comparable choice.)
But Scrivener’s starry-eyed apostles notwithstanding, a crucial question remains: Are there any writing apps out there that will actually make you more creative? Not more fiercely productive. Not more efficient. But more imaginative, fresh, inspired, and afire with what Wordsworth called the “auxiliary light” of the mind? Does the app exist that will make your novel come out not simply faster and cleaner, but better?
According to neuroscientist Nancy Andreasen , creativity means engaging in “thoughts and behaviors that are original and useful.” It involves such metrics as fluency (the ease with which words and ideas come to you), divergent thinking (cooking up a smorgasbord of possible solutions), and flexibility (the ability to adapt to circumstances). You can measure creativity in part by administering tests: The Torrance exams consist of verbal and figural puzzles, and Guilford’s Alternative Uses Task assesses imaginative problem-solving. From what I can tell, no writing app—or even brainteaser learning app—has been demonstrated to enhance performance on any of these challenges. So my suspicion is that Silicon Valley hasn’t yet found a way to bottle the creative transcendence we feel when “with an eye made quiet by the power/of harmony, and the deep power of joy,/we see into the life of things .”
Then again, I wrote this article in Microsoft Word.

If a  chaiwala  can become PM  I can become CM: UddhavUddhav Thackeray clarifies 'chaiwala' jibe at PM Modi

Mumbai, Oct.15 (ANI): Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday clarified his 'chaiwala' jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying he meant that the people have the power to make an 'aam aadmi' the country's Prime Minister.
"I said that a common man is the most powerful in a democracy. It means that the people have the power to make an 'aam aadmi' the Prime Minister," Thackeray said, adding that Prime Minister Modi himself said that he is a 'chaiwala' in his address to people.
In an interview published in Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamna, Thackeray had said if a 'chaiwala' can become the Prime Minister, he can definitely become Maharashtra's Chief Minister.
The BJP leaders had lashed out at Thackeray following his remark, saying they will not tolerate such disrespect for the Prime Minister.
The Shiv Sena leader also said he did not see anyone as his opponent in Maharashtra
"I do not see anyone as opponent, the problems of Maharashtra are my opponents. I have answers to the problems that people of Maharashtra are facing, I urge them to come in huge numbers and vote for Shiv Sena," Thackeray said. (ANI)

The 8 biggest myths about rich peopleThe 8 Biggest Myths About Rich People
By Christina Lavingia | U.S.News & World Report LP –  Thu 25 Sep, 2014 6:10 PM IST

Thinkstock
When we see rich people, either in our daily lives or in the media, we have assumptions about them. The monikers of wealth -- designers bags, expensive sunglasses and luxury vehicles -- usually help us identify the status of that individual and make seemingly logical assumptions about their lifestyles.
The thing is, not every wealthy person is a big spender with an immaculate financial history. In fact, being wealthy doesn't mean you necessarily have any clue how to manage your personal finances. Here are eight stereotypes about rich people and names you know who break the mold.
1. They're homeowners.
Celebrity reality shows like "Keeping Up With the Kardashians" and MTV's "Cribs" have confirmed our assumptions that rich celebrities inhabit the palace-like homes and condos of Malibu and New York City. Yes, many rich people -- celebrities or not -- own their homes, but not all of them do. In fact, several celebrities, including actresses Diane Keaton, Meg Ryan and Jane Fonda, have paid rent for their residences.
Queen Latifah rented a 4,700-square-foot loft in Atlanta from Fonda, in fact, for $10,000 a month, according to Zillow. For celebrities and businessmen who change their residences regularly for work, renting might be a better financial option. Although, at $10,000 a month we can't say Latifah's rental is low budget.
2. They're experts at money management.
Wealth, if it's not inherited, is often the product of making it in a business. Whether you've built your name up to command a certain salary, as is the case with athletes and celebrities, or built up a company, honing that entrepreneurial mindset is often key to accumulating wealth. However, just because someone knows how to acquire money doesn't mean he knows how to manage it.
Wonder how the rich continue to get richer? They can afford financial advisors who make sure their money works as hard as they do. Even entrepreneurs like Mark Zuckerberg, who started Facebook from his college dorm room, turn to financial advisors when it comes to managing the product of their success and business savvy. Divesh Makan advises both Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg on their financial decisions.
3. They have perfect credit.
Credit scores are used to measure the likelihood that someone will pay back what he or she borrows on time. Those who fail to do this will experience a credit score decrease , which will hike up the interest rate offered when borrowing in the future.
It's natural to assume that the wealthiest people have high credit scores that help contribute to their wealth. However, because rich people can be extravagant spenders, this is not always the case. Celebrities with debt, or who have gone bankrupt, suffer from low credit scores. Lindsay Lohan, for example, reportedly owed $600,000 in credit card debt in 2010, requiring a minimum monthly payment of $15,000. Who knows whether Lohan managed her payments or what her exact interest rate was, but it's safe to assume that her credit history reflected her spending decisions.
4. They're big spenders.
This is true for many rich people, especially celebrities, but it's not a rule. With more money comes the ability to purchase luxury goods and pay for extravagant experiences. The more money you have, the cheaper that private yacht or -- in the case of Virgin Group founder Richard Branson -- that island might seem. However, just because you're rich doesn't mean you have to act like it. Zuckerberg is famous for his trademark gray T-shirt and hoodies, and he isn't the only entrepreneur who exercises frugality.
Warren Buffett is the third-richest man in the world, boasting a net worth of $63.3 billion, according to Business Insider. With an average earnings of $37 million per day, the Oracle of Omaha is famously frugal and still resides in the home he purchased in 1958 for $31,500.
5. They're debt-free.
The belief that wealth and debt cannot co-exist is turned on its head by a wide range of celebrities. From Lohan's credit card debt, to the $18 million professional boxer Mike Tyson owed the Internal Revenue Service, those who command big paychecks and endorsement deals also often have debt to match.
Even with a fortune of $300 million, Tyson's debt reached $38 million in 2004, according to USA Today. Other celebrities who struggled with debt include actors Nicholas Cage and Burt Reynolds, photographer Annie Leibovitz and former baseball player Jose Canseco.
6. They come from money.
The silver spoon perception of wealthy people isn't entirely misguided. After all, heirs of family fortunes have a significant head start toward wealth. However, the whole concept of the American dream is centered on the self-made man who has control over his financial status, regardless of family money.
We're seeing self-made men climb to the top of the earnings charts, as places like Silicon Valley churn out wealthy tech entrepreneurs at an alarming rate. Some of the world's most successful people started off not just in the middle class, but poor. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz was raised in a housing complex for the poor in Brooklyn, and business mogul and talk show host Oprah Winfrey was born into a poor family in Mississippi. Forbes estimates that Schultz is now worth $2.1 billion, while Winfrey sits at $82 million.
7. They've never been bankrupt.
Much like debt, bankruptcy seems to be the antithesis of wealth. However, some of the most successful people lost everything at some point. Some wealthy people who bounced back from bankruptcy include Henry Ford, Walt Disney, Milton Hershey and H.J. Heinz -- all of whom went on to create brands we still see in our everyday lives.
Another example: Hotel mogul Donald Trump has filed for corporate bankruptcy an astounding four times -- in 1991, 1992, 2004 and 2009 -- but he's worth more today than he was before filing for Chapter 11 the first time. In 1990, Forbes estimated Trump was worth $500 million; he's now valued at $4 billion.
8. They don't have a budget.
With wealth comes the ability to live carefree on an infinite budget, right? While even the likes of Bill Gates and Warren Buffett have only so many billions to spend, one could think that these megarich don't need a budget at all, especially since they're not living paycheck to paycheck. However, a wise person who has amassed wealth lives on a budget, as he understands that just as quickly as it was earned, it can all be lost .
Actress Kiera Knightley revealed to Glamour magazine this year that she's been living on a $50,000 annual budget since 2012, despite her $50 million net worth.
"My parents were actors and writers, and that gives you the mentality of, OK, I've got [money] now, but it could all go," Knightley told Glamour.
Just as you have to budget for retirement, your mortgage and car payments, groceries and other expenses, wealthy people should and do apply the same guidelines for themselves; when they don't, it's likely that their wealth will be misspent, leaving nothing for the future.

For a Swachh Bharatiya Rail

The Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan emphasising cleanliness has provided the right opportunity for Indian Railways to address infrastructural gaps contributing to dirty premises and trains
Imagine being bitten by a rat, not once but twice! That is what happened recently to a person travelling in a train to Chennai. The passenger, rather than reacting hysterically, calmly squeezed the bite wound, before complaining to the railway authorities and seeking medical aid. The local railway authorities, while expressing regret, told the passenger that the rake (train formation) is maintained at Mumbai, implying that the responsibility for the presence of the pesky rodent lay elsewhere.
Now, why should a rat be found in a train? To be sure, railways and rats (and bandicoots and mice) have had a long association going back almost to the advent of the railways in India in the mid-nineteenth century. But while in the past, rats and their kindred species were largely confined to goods sheds, parcel offices and occasionally got sucked into train vacuum pipes (now thankfully defunct with the advent of airbrakes), now they have become frequent travellers in reserved and AC coaches. The average passenger is wont to attribute this to the utter negligence, callousness, and inefficiency of a government-run monopoly. However such a conclusion would be simplistic and hasty.
Ideal environment for rats
Some of the major train maintenance centres like the one in Chennai are located in the midst of thickly populated urban agglomerations. These are not enclosed or restricted spaces but open yards. Because of the washing and wet cleaning of the train formations, the inspection pits and surrounding areas are usually damp. Discarded food and waste matter including human excrement expelled from train formations coming in for maintenance add to the problem. This makes an ideal environment for rats, cockroaches and the like to breed. Pest control measures can at best be in the nature of a holding action. The current antiquated system of open yards is a carry over of a bygone era. Unfortunately, this aspect has never received the attention it has deserved.
The answer obviously is to have totally sanitised and covered state-of-the-art maintenance centres that can accommodate train formations of 24 or 26 coaches, with strict access control, totally dry inspection pits, and other facilities apart from separate washing bays with waste water reclamation. With the progressive introduction of modern designs of toilets, direct discharge of human waste to the outside can be avoided.
This is not some utopian scenario; what is suggested above are exactly the type of facilities that will be set up for the maintenance of the much-hyped bullet trains. There is no reason, therefore, why over the next decade or so similar facilities should not be set up, at least in major urban centres, to service trains used by the aam aadmi. But even with such improved facilities, due to the steady increase in the number of trains each year, stabling of train formations out in the open cannot be totally avoided. This entails keeping the yards also in a reasonable state of cleanliness, free of litter and unwanted vegetation.
The Indian attitude, ‘it is my privilege to litter, your duty to clean’, has to go
Further, with the intensive utilisation of train formations, they are often kept on station platforms for a long time and turned back after “dry” cleaning, with some unintended benefits for the rodent population. For railway stations are the other major centres for the proliferation of rodents and other pests. There are two reasons for this: first, the easy availability of edible garbage and second, the plentiful supply of perishables such as fish on the platforms. Indian Railways must perhaps be the only major railway system in the world where fare-paying passengers have to jostle for space with huge mounds of parcels scattered on the platforms of all major stations. This tyranny of the parcels is bound to continue unless there is complete segregation of parcels and passenger traffic. Studies have been conducted in the past towards this end, but no tangible progress has been achieved.
The Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan , launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has rightly emphasised cleanliness as a goal. It is high time, therefore, that attention is directed towards setting right the infrastructural shortcomings that contribute directly to insanitary conditions in railway premises and trains. While the images of ministers and senior officials posing with the broom may provide smart photo-ops, it will take more than the broom to clean up the Railways.
With more than 12,600 trains carrying 23 million passengers every day, Indian Railways must be that unique institution in the country that generates the largest volume and variety of garbage (including human waste) rivalling many large towns. To expect this huge volume of trash to be dealt with by an army of cleaning staff with brooms and such implements is to totally misjudge the nature and scale of the problem.
Comparisons are frequently drawn between the spotless premises and train interiors of railway systems abroad and the woeful condition of trains and stations in India. What is blithely overlooked is the fact that in those countries all public spaces, not only trains and stations, are generally litter-free, not because they employ an army of safaiwallas with brooms but because of the innate civic sense of the citizens. This is not an excuse for railway premises and trains being dirty or being infested with rats, cockroaches and the like. But while there are internal issues such as upgrading of maintenance facilities and segregation of parcel traffic involving heavy investments that the Railways themselves have to deal with, an equally important input is the positive contribution that the millions of railway users can make in ensuring a clean, litter-free environment. The attitude “it is my privilege to litter, your duty to clean” has to go.
Working in silos
The example of the rat bite shows how railway officials are unable to see the problem from the point of view of customers. For customers it is irrelevant where the train is maintained or from where the rat boarded the train. The problem here is with the structure of the railways organised in silos of functional departments. Thus, while train maintenance is with one department, station maintenance and sanitation are with another. With such split responsibility, shifting of blame between departments and even between railway zones becomes an almost instinctive, spontaneous organisational response.
A recently set up Railway Committee has been asked to spell out measures to ensure that railway departments don’t work in silos. The Committee will do well to examine that waste management is dealt with in its entirety from initial generation to final disposal. This should be a major contribution towards achieving the goal of a “Swachh Bharatiya Rail.”

Rebuilding VisakhapatnamUpdated: October 15, 2014 01:45 IST
Rebuilding Visakhapatnam
cyclones
The level of preparedness and the response by the Andhra Pradesh and Central governments, along with their agencies, in the face of the severe cyclonic storm Hudhud that ravaged Visakhapatnam on Sunday, have been commendable, and show that the lessons from previous natural calamities have indeed been learnt. Odisha was spared to a large extent, while the port city of Vizag bore the brunt of the cyclone. The airport, the naval establishments, roads, power lines , and the entire infrastructure of this garden city stand testimony to the massive scale of destruction. The disaster management teams, along with the Navy and other agencies, prepared the ground before the cyclone made landfall by evacuating about two lakh people living in vulnerable areas along the coast. And, after the storm crossed the coast, rescue and relief operations began. It is going to take a few weeks to get the basic infrastructure back in place. Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu rushed to review the situation, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi made an aerial survey of both States on Tuesday. Mr. Naidu has asked for an ad hoc interim assistance of Rs.2,000 crore and Mr. Modi has offered Rs.1,000 crore for immediate relief. Ensuring the availability of essential commodities, provision of drinking water and milk, and early resumption of power supply must remain urgent priorities.
The Andhra Pradesh-Odisha coastline has always remained vulnerable to high-intensity cyclones and natural calamities. The Bay of Bengal itself has been among the most frequented areas for severe cyclones, and Hudhud is the 75th such to hit the Andhra coast since 1871. With the evolution of the National Policy on Disaster Management and the creation of special teams to manage such disasters, India has clearly succeeded in vastly reducing the number of casualties over the years. But there is no way the damage could have been minimised. Neighbouring States have offered relief to get the power lines back on track and the Prime Minister should provide much-needed relief to Andhra Pradesh to overcome the havoc. The newly bifurcated State has already been seeking special category status to be eligible for substantial grants from the Centre to build a new capital and infrastructure. Mr. Naidu will do well to get foreign investors and the private sector to build a new airport for Visakhapatnam, where the badly mauled airport is under the Navy’s control and has not exactly been an asset to aid the development of this port city. The major National and State highways have suffered extensive damage and have to be relaid to their original standards. Given the massive number of trees felled by the cyclone, the authorities need to get the greenery back in place. It will be a major challenge to rebuild Visakhapatnam and its environs.

Pandey hails IPL for breakthroughTweet
0
Pandey thanks IPL.On May 21, 2009, a 20-year-old Manish Pandey , playing for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL, pummelled a Deccan Chargers bowling attack which included Ryan Harris , Andrew Symonds and Pragyan Ojha , as he went on to become the first Indian centurion in the competition.
While Pandey's form in the IPL remained consistent - he has scored 1346 runs combined for four teams - a national call-up did not immediately materialise. But when it eventually did, more than five years later, Pandey was quick to praise the positive impact that the IPL had on his career.
"It [IPL] definitely helped. As a batsman, you look to be consistent every game and win matches for your team," Pandey told ESPNcricinfo. "This year, even my first-class experience was very good, as I scored a lot of runs and backed it up with a good IPL and Champions League. Being consistent is why I think I've gotten this call-up. The IPL has done a lot of good and gave me a lot of confidence. We play with some of the best players in the world and we get to learn a lot. We get used to the pressure, and learn how to deal with other players."
Pandey, who helped Kolkata Knight Riders to their second IPL title with a 50-ball 94 in the final against Kings XI Punjab, also played a key role for Karnataka last season. He scored 729 runs in the Ranji Trophy at 48.60 with three hundreds and three fifties, as Karnataka went on to claim the title. Pandey hoped the first-class experience would eventually pave the way for a Test debut.
"As a batsman, playing Test cricket is my goal. I love the challenges when you play with the red ball, as it requires a lot more focus. I love batting in those conditions, and my runs would attest to that.
"It will hopefully be a good season for Karnataka again. We need to maintain the same standard of performances, and look to work harder and bag the Ranji Trophy again."
Pandey, who cites Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid as his two idols, said he was disappointed not to make his international debut earlier, but that he was now fully focused on the immediate task at hand, which is to beat West Indies and secure the ODI series.
"I expected the call-up to come sooner and would've loved to play a couple of years ago," he said. "But I've matured a lot over the years and played a lot more cricket. I'm ready for the games. West Indies are a good team, but as Indians, we need to be aware of how strong we are. We are looking to win both the ODIs and the T20. I'm not nervous, as I've played with or against most of the players in the team. I think it will be good fun and a great experience for me."

Oil price crash piles pressure on PutinCrashing oil prices could crush Vladimir Putin
By Jesse Solomon   @JesseSolomonCNN October 15, 2014: 7:23 AM ET
 
Gas prices drop 50 cents since summer
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
Falling oil prices are good for American drivers, but not for Russia.
In early March when Russia first sent troops into Ukraine, oil was trading comfortably above $100 per barrel. Now, it's around $81, a level not seen in three years.
That's a tough pill for Russia to swallow since the country relies heavily on oil revenues to bankroll its budget -- over half of the government's revenues come from oil and gas.
"We're probably getting closer to the point of pain," said Phil Flynn, an energy analyst at the Price Futures Group. "It's definitely putting the squeeze on their balance sheet."
Russia's economy is hurting: However you look at it, Russia is hurting. Its stock market (the Micex Index) has plunged 6% in the last three months, and the Russian Ruble is down 20% against the dollar this year.
The World Bank forecasts anemic Russian economic growth of just 0.5% in 2014 and 0.3% in 2015. A more pessimistic scenario foresees the Russian economy slipping into recession this year and contracting further in 2015 and 2016.
Related: Ruble's headlong plunge shows Russia hurting
So far, no one is cutting back on oil production. American and European energy companies, not to mention the oil rich members of OPEC, are flooding the global market for cheap oil.
To be sure, Russia has over $450 billion in international currency reserves, so it's not anywhere near crisis mode yet. And while its biggest corporations, including government controlled oil company Rosneft and banking giant Gazprombank, are banned from tapping the long term American and European debt markets due to sanctions , they are still cash rich and shouldn't have trouble finding alternative financing.
This week Russia also signed a slew of agreements with China, including a deal to supply the country with natural gas for 30 years starting in 2018.
 
Russia eyes China after Europe snub
Ballooning budget: But there's a chance that depressed oil prices could take a bite out of Russian President Valdimir Putin's ambitious military agenda.
Last month, Russian news agency Itar-Tass reported that military spending by the country will rise by 21% next year. A few weeks later, Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov was quoted by Reuters saying the country "cannot afford" the defense program.
Regardless, Michael Fitzpatrick, a former energy analyst with the Kilduff Report who still actively trades oil futures, doesn't think oil prices have been pushed down enough to substantially eat into Russia's GDP and trickle down to the general population.
Related: Russian hackers exploit Windows to spy on West
"I don't think you're looking at any political or social unrest unless prices go considerably lower," he said.
Making up for lost oil revenue: The government also has a history of seizing assets to bolster the government's control over the energy industry.
Last month, Russian state prosecutors seized an oil company belonging to one of the country's leading oligarchs, Vladimir Evtushenkov. He was placed under house and charged with money laundering when his holding company -- Sistema -- bought the Bashneft oil firm in 2009.
The case has echoes of the Yukos affair a decade ago, when Mikhail Khodorkovsky was thrown in jail and forced to sell most of his oil company Rosneft.

Exit polls give BJP edge in Maharashtra  HaryanaNew Delhi, October 15, 2014

Exit polls give more seats for BJP in Maharashtra
Priyanka Kakodkar
The Hindu BJP is likely to emerge as the largest party in both Maharashtra and Haryana Assembly elections stopping short of majority, according to exit polls.
SLIDESHOW
election
Shiv Sena placed second; Congress and NCP trail
The high-stakes Maharashtra election on Wednesday, which saw a five-cornered contest, recorded a 63.4 per cent turnout, almost four per cent higher than the figures for the 2009 Assembly polls and the Lok Sabha polls in May. The Mumbai voter turnout was 51.96 per cent, which is almost 6 per cent higher than the 2009 figure of 46.1 per cent.
Most exit polls on television showed the BJP winning the highest number of seats, but falling short of the half-way mark of 145. However, the Chanakya poll, which accurately forecast the Lok Sabha results, predicted an absolute majority for the BJP with 151 seats, give or take 9. The Shiv Sena was placed second. The Congress came third in most of the polls, ahead of its former ally, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).
The sundering of long-standing political alliances shortly before the poll seems to have pushed more voters to the booth. The election is generally seen as a referendum on whether the Modi wave persists past the Lok Sabha polls. It will also determine whether the BJP’s former ally the Shiv Sena’s strident Marathi pride campaign will polarise this section against the party.
The election will also test whether the former allies, the Congress and the NCP, which ran the government for 15 years, will be able to combat anti-incumbency by contesting separately. Raj Thackeray’s party, which was reduced to a non-entity in the Lok Sabha polls, will be fighting to retain its relevance.
Attack on Modi
The acrimony between the former saffron allies was evident even on polling day after the Shiv Sena’s newspaper, Dopahar ka Saamna, referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a tea-seller on Wednesday.
“Mr. Modi is the leader of the nation. The BJP will not tolerate this insult,” said Union Minister Nitin Gadkari. Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray attempted some damage control by saying, “I only meant to show the power of the common man, who voted a tea-seller to power.”

Stock market scare as Dow drops 460 pointsStock market scare as Dow drops 460 points
By Heather Long   @byHeatherLong October 15, 2014: 4:08 PM ET
 
Markets go for a wild ride
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
It's another "look out below" day in the stock market.
The Dow plunged as much as 460 points Wednesday afternoon before pulling back a bit, although a 173 point loss isn't anything to cheer. There wasn't an obvious trigger. Ebola and Europe's sour economy are clearly worrying. Earnings have been so-so, and retail sales data out this morning was disappointing.
October has been a brutal month, erasing most of the 2014 stock market gains. The Dow is negative for the year, and CNNMoney's Fear & Greed Index is showing extreme fear.
Most investors are better off not obsessing about the day to day market moves.
But if you're keeping an eye on the numbers, here are three critical stats to watch. There is no "magic number" that triggers a sell-off, but these indicators would be big red flags.
1. We're near a correction, but not there yet
Only a month ago, the S&P 500 index closed at an all-time high of 2,011. At its worst point on Wednesday, the index was down around 9.5% since that September high. That's rough, but it's not quite the 10% drop that would constitute a true correction, let alone the 20% drop that would signal a bear market.
Related: Stocks should fall more. Corrections are normal
Keep an eye on this number: 1,810. If the S&P 500 slips below that, we're in a correction. As of Wednesday afternoon, the S&P is hovering around 1,860.
(For those who like numbers, at the nadir of the financial crisis in March 2009, the S&P 500 closed below 700).
2. Volatility is back: It's getting windy, but not quite gale force wind levels
The VIX volatility index is currently at about 23.
Most days the stock market moves a little bit higher or lower. For instance, the S&P 500 moved less than 0.2% on Tuesday. But since the end of October, the stock market has had numerous "wild swings" where it shifts more than 1% (or even more than 2% in some cases).
Related: Is it time to exit stocks?
That's referred to as volatility. The VIX Index is the main measure of volatility. It has spiked about 80% in the past month -- a huge jump. The VIX was all over the place on Wednesday, but settled around 26. That's a lot higher than the 12 to 13 it was at a month ago.
But the unofficial alarm bell is when the VIX hits the 30 mark. It crossed that line briefly Wednesday before falling back.
3. Investors are putting money into bonds. It's debatable whether it's a 'freak out'
When investors get scared, they don't run to mom, they run to bonds, especially U.S. government bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury is a good indicator of just how many people are seeking the safe arms of the bond market.
When the yield falls, you know people are gobbling up bonds.
In the middle of September, the yield on the 10-year Treasury was around 2.6%. On Tuesday it was at 2.2%. That's a quick drop, but the real indicator of a meltdown would be for the yield to drop to 2% or even below.
Sure enough, on Wednesday, the yield fell below that mark several times, although it ended the day above 2.1%.
Dropping below that "magic two" number isn't unheard of . It happened in early 2013 and in 2012 when Europe was in the midst of a debt crisis and America's economic recovery was looking uncertain.
Market jitters are clearly back, but we're not quite in a "correction" yet.

10-year Treasury yield briefly fell below 2%Treasury yields tumble, bond prices soar

Yields on Treasury securities plunged Wednesday as investors sought a safe haven from the stock market rout, and traders realized that the global economy is entering another slowdown.
USA TODAY
The yield on the bellwether 10-year Treasury note fell as low as 1.873%, the lowest since May 2013, before settling at 2.13%. And the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell below 3%, to 2.92%. Other government bond yields plunged as well:
French 10-year government bond: 1.13%
German 10-year government bond: 0.75%
Japanese 10-year government bond: 0.48%
“Two percent looks sky-high compared to Germany,” says John Lonski, Team Managing Director of the Economics Group at Moody’s Analytics. “The bond market is finally pricing in the reality of indefinite subpar growth for aging advanced economies.”
Why the bond rally? Investors look for safety from government bonds in times of crisis. And currently, investors fear losing money through falling prices — deflation — rather than through rising prices, or inflation.
The specter of deflation is haunting the markets. Oil prices have plunged to four-year lows on lower demand and bountiful production. The implied inflation rate for the next 30 years, based on 30-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, is just 2.09%. For the next 10 years, the implied inflation rate is 1.85%.
Even in China, one of the world’s most rapidly growing economies, inflation is a low 1.6% — primarily because of stagnating wages. “Chinese wages are going nowhere,” Lonski says.
And signs of slowdown in the U.S. point to deflation, not inflation. Despite rock-bottom mortgage rates, for example, the 52-week average of the Mortgage Bankers’ index of home buyers’ applications is at the lowest since March 1996, Lonski says. Baby Boomers, once a driving force in the economy, are spending less — partly because those who have lost their jobs in the past five years must settle for sharply lower wages. “They’re going to get contract jobs and do the same work they did previously at lower wages,” Lonski says.
The plunge in bond yields means that the Federal Reserve could delay raising rates until late in 2015, and could even be tempted to embark on another stimulus program. From the Fed’s point of view, an outburst of inflation would be far easier to combat than widespread deflation.
The Fed can attack inflation by raising rates, but it has little room to push rates down further. “There are not a lot a lot of bullets left if things get worse,” says Bill Irving, portfolio manager of Fidelity Government Income fund.
The bonus for the worried: When bond yields fall, bond prices rise. For example, iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (ticker: TLT), soared 2.4% early Wednesday, before settling at a 0.76% gain, says Morningstar. The 10-year T-note yield has fallen nearly a full percentage point since the end of 2013, when it yielded 3.03%. Investors in the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond have seen their shares soar 16.5% this year.
And, says Irving, mortgage rates are headed south again. Quicken Loans posted a 3.875% rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, Irving notes, making this a good time to refinance a high-rate mortgage.

E-commerce companies are being valued at 2-3 times their worth: Avnish BajajE-commerce companies are being valued at 2-3 times their worth: Avnish Bajaj
Ranju Sarkar |  Oct 16, 2014 12:39 AM IST
In the past three weeks, early-stage venture capital firm Matrix Partners has invested in three start-ups. In an interview, Avnish Bajaj, managing partner, Matrix Partners explains to Ranju Sarkar why his firm is bullish on e-commerce. Bajaj says although valuations are getting frothy, the story is driven much more by fundamentals, and India could see the emergence of 30-40 billion-dollar e-commerce companies in the next five years. Excerpts:
You announced three deals in 3 weeks. What explains that?
The announcements typically trail the investments. For the past one year and a half, our investment pace has been higher. We used to do 6-8 deals in a year; now we are tracking 10-12 deals. It is largely driven by the opportunities.
Our strong view is that there's a once-in-a-lifetime confluence of three or four factors, which has made investment very attractive. We have seen the market deepen. To have a critical mass, there has to be at least 20 million daily active users on the internet. That's when a number of business models that were not attractive earlier start becoming attractive. That happened in 2011. Then the second inflection happened in mid-2012, when the mobile internet users exceeded desktop internet users. There was an e-commerce bubble between 2010 and 2012, which we consciously did not participate because we felt the valuations were running ahead of their time. Call it part serendipity and part luck, we turned aggressive right around the time when people turned conservative (between 2012 and early 2014 when all series-B rounds were frozen and e-commerce saw consolidation).
Were the valuations not cheaper earlier, say, in 2010-2011?
Most people who invested between 2010 and 2012 have lost their money. It's not about valuations. Those business models did not make sense and there was not a deep a market to do it. In 2014, the valuations are getting frothy, but the growth rates of some of these companies are mind-blowing. They are growing 5-10 times, year-over-year. My definition of a bubble is that when the valuations are completely out of sync with the fundamentals, and probably order of magnitude ahead of fundamentals.
So, clearly 1999-2000 was a bubble, 2007 was a bubble, and the period between 2010 to 2012 was a bubble, too. I believe the current valuations are frothy and high, and, maybe, the companies are getting valued one or two rounds ahead. I mean, what they are getting in Series-B round of funding, is what they should be getting in Series-C. Companies are getting valued at two or three times of what they should be valued at. They are not getting valued at 10-50 times, which to me is a bubble. Even if you assume a company is valued at two or three times of what it should be, in a year it actually grows and exceeds that valuation. We are betting on the fact that the market has deepened, and unlike in the bubble year, companies are not growing by giving money away. Yes, in some cases, the burn is increasing. But in a lot of cases, we are seeing this kind of growth without increasing the burn, which is a really healthy indicator of a solid business model. To me, this boom is real; it is much more fundamentals-driven, but yes, valuations are getting a little frothy. I have never seen this quality of entrepreneurs in my life in India.
You spoke about the confluence of three or four factors. We spoke about the market deepening, what are the others?
First of all, you have entrepreneurs who are in it for the long-term, and they are looking to create large companies, and not looking to exit. The market has deepened and people are shopping a lot more. People may discount, but they are focused on their contribution margin, they are looking at the lifetime value of customers and customer acquisition costs. So, the business models are much more robust. Given the funding environment, people have a long-term view of the market to let it grow and to make it very large. People are recognising how big this can be. It you look at China, all the metrics, whether it is internet or mobile, they look remarkably similar to what India looked like now or 6-12 months earlier. In the past seven years, 70-80 billion-dollar companies have been created in China. India is a smaller market, but at least 30-40 such companies should happen here in the next five years.
Is there a change in the way you evaluate start-ups? Or, are you willing to invest at an earlier stage?
We evaluate exactly the same way, except that we are willing to invest at an earlier stage today. If the founders figure out the right product-market fit in our lingo, the business is going to take-off very quickly. Unlike in the past, it could take one-two-three years for the business to take off and we could come in at any time, we believe now things will take off very faster. We should get in early. Once it takes off, it will become expensive for us.
At what stage of the company would you like to get in today vis-à-vis you got in earlier?
If you define the various stages in a start-up, there's a concept stage, then founding team fully in place, the third phase would be minimum viable product or MVP, the fourth would be initial traction (it's never revenues, just traction on metrics), and the next would be scaling, monetisation and profitability. We have played in almost all. If you look at Limeroad.com, we invested in her at the concept stage, she did not even have a founding team. Normally, we would invest at the traction stage - there's a team, there's some product, and there's some initial traction. We don't worry about monetisation and scaling. We are now willing to go back to concept-plus-team stage. If the team is not complete, then we don't take the risk.
Is this driven by the fact that valuations are getting expensive, and you need to get in early?
Earlier, concept to scaling would be two-to-three years. That would give us plenty of time to get in. Now, when the market has arrived and it is deep, that phase could be six months. So, it is driven by how quickly adoption can happen. Yes, if it takes off in six months, things will get hyper-competitive, pricing will go haywire, and we might not be able to win the deal beyond a point. Our DNA is to work very closely with the company.

Things you should know about Man Booker winner Richard FlanaganThings you should know about Man Booker winner Richard Flanagan
Nilanjana S Roy | New Delhi Oct 15, 2014 11:25 PM IST
Out of the many stories that Richard Flanagan tells so well about himself and Australia’s past, there’s the unforgettable one about the time he met the Lizard.
He was researching The Narrow Road to the Deep North, the novel about WWII’s Death Railway; his father had been one of the troops—British, Australian, Dutch, Indian—who survived being conscripted by the Japanese into building the Burma-Siam line. Over 100,000-200,000 of the labourers conscripted died: “more corpses than there are words in my novel,” Flanagan told Guernica. Then he met the Lizard. Once one of the most brutal of the camp commanders, he was now “a gentle, gracious old man” who spoke quietly of the past. They talked for an hour, and then Flanagan asked the man to slap him. It had been one of the camp punishments; he wanted to see what it would be like. The Lizard, now just another old man, slapped him, reluctantly, just as one of Tokyo’s earthquakes shook the room. Flanagan says to his interviewer: “And I realised at that moment that wherever evil was, it wasn’t in that room with me and that frightened old man.” 
Neither Flanagan’s novels nor his life as an activist lean on the comfort of easy answers. He grew up in Tasmania and said in his Booker speech: “I come from a tiny mining town in the rainforest in an island at the end of the world. My grandparents were illiterate. And I never expected to stand here before you in this grand hall in London as a writer being so honoured.” 
The bookies’ odds on Flanagan had improved as the date of the prize announcement drew closer, but Neel Mukherjee’s The Lives of Others and Howard Jacobson’s J had been the front-runners, with Ali Smith, Karen Joy Fowler and Joshua Ferris also producing rewarding novels. Readers who know Flanagan’s writing love the way in which he finds different answers in different novels to the question of how humans make their peace with memory or are weighed down by its rough stones. Those who haven’t read Flanagan before might want to begin with Gould’s Book of Fish or The Unknown Terrorist, just to whet your appetite for The Narrow Road to the Deep North.
It is typical of Flanagan that a book built on such grim material, historical and personal, should begin so beautifully: “Why at the beginning of things is there always light?” Dorrigo Evans, now in his old age was one of the men who had survived the Line; he finds his solace in the writings of men long dead, Homer, Basho, Shisui. “As naked slaves, they were starved and beaten and worked beyond exhaustion on the Line. And as naked slaves they began to die for the Line. No one could reckon it, neither the weak nor the strong. The dead began to accumulate.”
This is an Australian story, but also a Japanese and a Korean one, in parts, and it is Flanagan’s particular genius to convey what it means for ordinary people to be overtaken by a tragedy, still clinging to the once-commonplace, now-luxurious hope of their former lives.
Flanagan’s view of history is hardwon, and not at all academic. He has agitated successfully against pulp mills, for instance, calling others to stand on the road along with him and place their bodies between the machines and their homes: “Our love. Our island. Let's take it back. Let's start marching.” His attacks on John Howard, Australia’s refugee policy, the country’s treatment of Aborigines, loggers and Kevin Rudd have been sharp and furious. In an essay on the Commonwealth, he speaks for many when he writes of his own discovery: “Slow and stumbling and finally astonishing, that we were never British in disposition or temperament, that the great southern land had its own stories.”  
Being born too late and missing the dream of Empire is a blessing for Flanagan, who has felt free to turn the force of his conscience and his writing – both often entwined – on the myths and wounds of his own country. For a man of such passionate political temperament, his Booker Prize speech was equally revealing of his character. His novels are attempts to capture “life itself”, not thinly fictionalised polemics. He would get back to critiquing Australia soon enough. But when he went up to accept his prize at the Guildhall, Flanagan did not speak of his quarrels with the idea of the Commonwealth, or of the weight of history’s ghosts.
Instead, he included his fellow writers: “Josh, Karen, Howard, Neel and Ali—I see tonight as ours, not mine”. His speech was about the love of writing, and the way in which its practice was a journey into humility.
And Flanagan ended with the most passionate defence of his profession heard in a while, one that will last as his books will: “As a species it is story that distinguishes us, and one of the supreme expressions of story is the novel. Novels are not content. Nor are they are a mirror to life or an explanation of life or a guide to life. Novels are life, or they are nothing.”

Exit polls project BJP as largest party in Maha  Haryana | Full coverageBJP
(BJP was today projected…)
NEW DELHI: BJP was today projected in exit polls to emerge as the largest party in both Maharashtra and Haryana Assembly elections stopping short of majority.
The Congress and NCP, which were ruling Maharashtra for 15 years before they split ahead of the elections, were projected to lose heavily while Shiv Sena was predicted to emerge as the second largest party.
One exit poll conducted by 'Today's Chanakya', however, gave a clear majority for BJP in both Maharashtra and Haryana.
Maharashtra, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi campaigned extensively addressing 27 rallies, appears to be heading for a BJP government for the first time in the state's history.
According to C-voter exit poll telecast on Times Now and Zee News channels, BJP was projected to get 129 out of 288 seats. Its erstwhile ally Shiv Sena was projected to get 56 seats while Congress was predicted to bag 43, NCP 36, MNS 12 and others 12. For a majority, a party has to get 145 seats.
In the outgoing assembly, BJP had 47 seats while Shiv Sena had 45. Congress had 82 seats, NCP 62 and MNS had 12.
Exit poll conducted by AC Nielson for ABP channel gave BJP 127 seats, Shiv Sena 77, Congress 40, NCP 34 and MNS 5.
An exit poll telecast on India TV gave BJP between 124 and 134 seats, Shiv Sena 51-61, Congress 38-48, NCP 31-41 and MNS and others 9-15 each.
Today's Chanakya exit poll telecast on News24 channel gave BJP a clear majority with 151 seats while Shiv Sena was given 71. Congress was given 27 while NCP 28. MNS was projected to get 11.
The same pollster projected clear majority for BJP in Haryana, giving it 52 of the 90 seats. INLD comes second with 23 seats, Congress 10 and others 5.

Uber Rival Gett Is Making a Risky, Clever Play in the Ride-Sharing Game

Sometimes it's easy to forget that there are contestants in the on-demand car-service game other than Uber and Lyft. One of them is Gett , and starting today it's making a big move to get more recognition from arguably the most important players: for-hire drivers.
Alison Griswold
Alison Griswold is a Slate staff writer covering business and economics.
Gett announced on Wednesday that it will begin paying drivers on its platform a flat rate of $0.70 per minute—an amount it says will double the typical payout for drivers on competing services UberX and Lyft. The $0.70 will come after sales tax and commission, and is separate from any money drivers make in customer tips. Under the new payment system, Gett claims, drivers working 40 hours per week will be able to touch six figures for the year. "Gett more money than ever before" is the tag line.

The $0.70 rate for drivers is rolling out just over a month after Gett announced a similarly attractive incentive for New York City riders: flat $10 fees to take any trip in Manhattan. There's no price-surging and no added cost for time ticking away as you sit in midtown traffic. "We don't try to cut corners to find a cheaper price point," says Ron Srebro, Gett's chief executive. "We always play fair, we always work only with licensed drivers."
In chasing that goal, the company is stepping into uncertain economic territory. Gett has now drastically cut fares on the consumer side of its platform and presumably increased expenditures on the driver side. That doesn't make a whole lot of sense—how can it offset higher costs to drivers while cutting prices for consumers? Srebro was reluctant to elaborate on how Gett plans to wrangle the finances of all this but admitted that Gett has not tested this particular pay-and-fare model in any of its other markets. (Gett is active in 24 cities including London, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and Haifa.)
"I do think categorically that this is totally sustainable," Srebro says. "The $10 promotion for us is sustainable. The driver pay is sustainable. And even for us if we need to change that balance a little, it will be sustainable." It's certainly possible that in the short term, Gett's markets abroad—which Srebro says are bigger, more established, and more competitive with Uber—will help subsidize losses in New York. "This is a growth business so no, we're not losing a lot of money," he adds.
What's most interesting about Gett's decision is the implicit understanding that drivers are every bit as important—if not more so—than customers on its two-sided platform. So far, Uber and Lyft have largely played to the consumers' interests as they undercut each others' fares and pushed down driver pay as well. But lately drivers have grown frustrated with this system. When Uber tried to force its high-end SUV drivers to take cheap UberX fares, the drivers protested until Uber backed down . More and more, drivers are shuttling back and forth between Uber and Lyft and other on-demand car services to work for the one that currently pays the best rate and treats its workers the fairest.
Gett isn't as big as Uber and Lyft, and it certainly isn't as well-known in the U.S. But if Gett can draw enough drivers from its competitors to slow down their services without going broke in the process, it has a shot at carving out a bigger space for itself in the ride-sharing market.

Agnikalam: India s strategy - both Japan and China The answer is no!Agnikalam: India's strategy - both Japan and China? The answer is no!
Agnikalam |  Oct 15, 2014 09:50 PM IST
Mr Modi recently visited Japan which was followed quickly by a visit to India by the Chinese President. Both promised India considerable FDI, China predictably more than Japan. Mr Modi's ease of manner with the Japanese Prime Minister gave Indians yet another proof of the former's ability to reach out. His confident manner with the Chinese President gave them reassurance in particular as he did not shy away from raising the border issue. Which of the two is a surer and safer option for India to partner with?
India's risk and uncertainty in engaging with China are obviously linked to the inevitability of China being a bad neighbour. Numerous and increasingly intensifying incursions are occurring across the Indian border, the most recent during the President's visit. The blatant objective, declared by their army, was to build strategic border roads. It was followed by the President's statement upon return exhorting the army to prepare for a regional war. It is unlikely that the reference was only to the South China Sea. It could comprise the Ides of March for India if it commits the folly of letting such mongering pass.
The risk is also associated with China's long-standing approach in sharing responsibility in global growth before the global economic crisis and, after, with its resistance to fair burden sharing. Table 1 reveals some stark contrasts that have emerged over three decades from the 1980s. Between 1981-2013, India's GDP increased from $19.7 thousand crore to $188 thousand crore, and China's from $19.4 thousand crore (lower than India's) to $924 thousand crore (about five times India's). Japan's GDP grew from $120 thousand crore (more than six times India or China) to $490 thousand crore (half of China and two and a half times India's).
China's phenomenal growth compared to Japan and even more so in relation to India is not strictly admirable in terms of human rights or international trade. The decades-long absence of labour rights is finally resulting in selective manifestation of labour unrest, albeit quickly crushed every time. The absence of political rights was recently manifest in emotional student protests in Hong Kong. And the global crisis finally impelled trading partners to protest China's international market manipulation through artificially low exchange rates with the objective of pushing exports significantly above expected growth in terms of quality or technology. Consequently, it initiated a currency appreciation, albeit reluctant and slow.
Japan has been demonstrably more cooperative in international relations. The secularly high trade surplus with the United States of the 1980s was broken by its acceptance of reducing the quantum of automobile exports, a quantitative policy verboten in the context of international trade. It protested mildly that the Japanese did not appear to prefer American cars when the United States further asked why the Japanese were not importing more of them. Throughout, Japan has revealed more willingness to go along with the international community in both trade and diplomacy. Indeed, Japan's prolonged economic recession, with periods of depression, is likely to have had its origin in that period of inarguable obeisance to the United States, robbing it of a way of life established from the mid 1800s by industrial houses such as Mitsui, Mitsubishi and Sumitomo in cooperation with Government. The squatters' park in front of the Tokyo Museum and the deserted department stores are presently its stark and constant reminders.
Post-War Japan's concept and practice of human rights are akin to those of India. It is pleasurable to see the variety of human behaviour in Tokyo's Shinjuku-ku where human hair assumes colours from the vibgyor and pedestrians are seen walking with their pictorial cellphones in front of their eyes. By contrast, seeing (twice) China's own citizens being handcuffed and ushered away from Tiananmen Square for lacking a "visa" to visit Beijing - their own national capital - cannot be erased from memory. Is it even imaginable that an Indian could be excluded by decree from Delhi? Indeed, a Delhi NGO went to court and ensured that some 80 rag-picker families would not be removed from their shacks atop a hill despite the Vasant Kunj connector remaining a bottleneck at that point. With luck, Indians should never suffer the Emergency ever again. Bedding with habituated human rights abusers is not, and should never be, Indian practice even for the direst economic reason. Those countries that have fallen prey to this fallacy will only further enable China's inexorable economic and political rise since it will continue to obfuscate and apply its own rules while the rest of the world tries to abide by globally configured principles.
Indo-Japan and Indo-China trade patterns are pointers. Figure 1 shows that, though India exports to Japan a bit less than it imports from it, in the case of China, India's imports are three and a half times its exports. Figure 2 shows India's imports and exports from and to Japan have remained similar in the last five years at about two per cent of India's global imports and exports respectively. However, in the case of China, it represents 11 per cent of India's global imports but only five per cent of India's global exports. Does India wish to become even more dependent on, and acquire a higher deficit with, China, a country that projects its naked power at every available opportunity? There is no need for India to be impolite but the clear policy should be an assiduous adherence to enhancing border security, strategic transport access through roads and airpower, and a continuing demonstration of fearlessness on the seas. And, paired with a clear turn exclusively towards Japan.
Unfortunately, India loses direly in its inability to control corruption including in Defence if wide ranging reports are given credibility while China can take quick action, including using capital punishment, to contain it. India need not replicate medieval remedies but it must control corruption for, otherwise, all arguments made above would stand on quicksand. At the moment, hopes are high that Mr Modi will improve things, perhaps even radicalise the issue. If not, it is expectable that the disaffected majority would find solutions sharper than Naxalism.

We will be number one in India: AirbusWe will be number one in India: Airbus
Aneesh Phadnis |  Oct 16, 2014 12:46 AM IST
IndiGo’s mega order for 250 Airbus A320 aircraft will propel Airbus into the top position in India’s narrow-bodied aircraft market, Kiran Rao, the aircraft manufacturer’s executive vice-president, has said.
“Even before this deal, Airbus A320 was the main aircraft for Indian carriers. We are in a dominant position. If you look at our orders, we will be number one for the next 10 years. When Vistara and AirAsia India expand, they will also choose Airbus and not switch fleets,” he added.
“IndiGo’s latest order is win-win for us. The airline is actually good for India, too, as it will help start new routes and boost the economy. We are manufacturing more than 40 planes a month, but the demand is quite high. Delivery slots for the A320neo are scare. IndiGo has locked in with a good price. It gives us good visibility, too,” Rao added.
About 170 Airbus aircraft operate in India. Since 2005, the company has accounted for about 60 per cent of new aircraft orders from India.
While Airbus has scored over Boeing with a string of large orders in the narrow-bodied segment, the latter seems to have an edge in the wide-bodied market in India. For international operations, Air India and Jet Airways largely rely on Boeing’s wide-bodied planes.
However, Rao is confident the Airbus A330neo will find buyers in India. “The A330neo will be the next big story for us. It holds potential in the clogged domestic trunk routes in India.”

Reliance PE is now Fairwinds; to raise $350 mnReliance PE is now Fairwinds; to raise $350 mn
Reghu Balakrishnan | Mumbai Oct 16, 2014 12:40 AM IST
Reliance Equity Advisors, the private equity (PE) arm floated by Anil Ambani's Reliance ADAG, is in a new avatar now. The fund, acquired by Reliance Equity Advisors' CEO Ramesh Venkat, through a first-of-its-kind management buyout in Indian PE space, has come out with a new name - Fairwinds Private Equity.
Currently, Fairwinds Asset Managers manages Reliance Alternative Investments Fund - Private Equity Scheme I, a $200-million fund raised in 2009-10. Reliance ADAG had invested 20 per cent in the first fund.
According to people in the know, Fairwinds will launch a $350-million fund by early next year with an investment size of $20-40 million per deal. The new fund will focus on companies in India engaged in domestic consumption, services, manufacturing and infrastructure allied businesses.
The first priority of Fairwinds is to make exits from eight of its past investments and return the fund to its investors in a time span of two years. As part of it, Fairwinds is in the process of exiting two of its investments - chemical manufacturer VVF Limited and education services provider Pathways.
The fund's leading investments include Shankara Infrastructure Materials, a multi-store chain that sells infrastructure materials; Max Flex and Imaging Systems, the maker of digital printing related goods; and, cookware maker Butterfly Gandhimathi Appliances.
When contracted, Ramesh Venkat, founder and managing partner of Fairwinds Asset Managers, refused to comment on the development. Fairwinds has retained the same team at Reliance PE. The nine-member team includes three partners, five directors and a chief financial officer.
Sanjeev Krishan, leader (private equity) at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) India, said: "We'd expect fund raising for India to be relatively easier over the next couple of years, than it has been over the previous two years. Global LPs need to be convinced about the India story all over again. They have been noticing the changes the new government has been setting in motion, but actual implementation of some of these is significant."
In the wake of bullish markets, a handful of general partners (GPs or fund managers) are trying their luck with a second round of fund-raising. Multiples Alternate Asset Management, a PE firm floated by Renuka Ramnath, is in process of raising its second fund of $500 million. Multiples had raised its maiden $405-million fund in 2010. Former Citi Venture head Ajay Relan-led CX Partners, which raised $515 million in its maiden fund, is looking to raise a $400-450-million second fund. PE firm Everstone Capital, which has launched Everstone Capital Partners III LP, is raising $600 million.
Amol Jain, former managing director of TPG Capital India, is also reportedly floating a $500-million first-time fund.
There is a marginal growth in new funds size in 2014, where $3 billion has been raised till date through 28 funds against 36 funds in 2013 with a corpus of $2.9 billion.

Special Arrangement GOING GREEN: Agroforestry provides an alternative to increasing forest green cover. Picture shows an agroforestry farm in Coimbatore.
TOPICS

Agroforestry promotes productive cropping environments, prevents deforestation, protects watersheds and enables agricultural land to withstand extreme weather events
Growing trees on farms is a triple-win strategy for combating simultaneously the challenges of increasing food production, mitigating greenhouse gases and adapting to climate change. It is an instrument of Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA), catapulted to centre-stage by President Obama’s launch of the Global Alliance for CSA at the World Climate Summit on September 23 at New York.
It was fitting, therefore, that “Trees for Life” was the theme of the World Agroforestry Congress held earlier this year in New Delhi. On this occasion the previous United Progressive Alliance government, supported by the National Advisory Council, unveiled the National Agroforestry Policy coinciding aptly with the International Year of Family Farming.
Benefits of tree-based farming
While planting trees on farms is as old as settled cultivation, “agroforestry” is a recently coined term derived from agriculture and forestry. It describes practices developed and employed by farmers over many centuries to cultivate trees on farmland together with crop and animal husbandry. While agroforestry comprises agriculture and forestry in seemingly separate land uses, its essence is of an integrated tree-based farming system. The science and technology, the institutions, and policy sphere of agroforestry is uniquely its own and characterised by a landscape approach.
When strategically applied on a large scale, with appropriate mix of tree species, agroforestry promotes productive and resilient cropping environments, prevents deforestation, protects watersheds and enables agricultural land to withstand extreme weather events, and climate change.
Tree-based farming systems have significant potential to provide employment to rural and urban populations through production and industrial application
Tree-based systems contribute robustly to livelihoods by providing both tree products and tree services. The bounties they offer include tree products such as fruit, fodder, fuel, fibre, fertilizer and timber which add to food and nutritional security, and income generation and insurance against crop failure. These products are tangible, have money value and are tradable in the markets. Trees also generate wealth through the services they provide in the form of soil and water conservation, nutrient recycling, carbon storage and biodiversity preservation. These services are intangible, not easy to quantify, and do not lend themselves to monetary valuation. At present there is no payment for eco-services provided by tree-based farming systems.
Agroforestry has significant potential to provide employment to rural and urban populations through production, industrial application and value addition ventures. Current estimates show that about 64 per cent of the country’s timber requirement is met from the trees grown on farms. Agroforestry has the potential for augmenting energy capacity through biomass, biodiesel, biochar and biogas production. It is also recognised that agroforestry is perhaps the only alternative to meeting the target of increasing forest green cover.
Despite all this, agroforestry has not become the movement it should have. For a long time the subject fell between the cracks of “agriculture” and “forestry” with no ownership by either sector. The value and position of agroforestry in the national system remains ambiguous and undervalued. It has been disadvantaged by adverse policies and legal bottlenecks. Its adoption by tenant-farmers is constrained due to insecurity of tenure. The subject lies fragmented in several Ministries with hardly any mechanism for convergence and coordination. Inadequate investment in the sector is also a cause for neglect. Unlike the credit and insurance products available for the crop sector, the provisions for growing trees-on-farms are minimal. Weak marketing infrastructure, absence of price discovery mechanisms and lack of post-harvest processing technologies further compound the situation.
Wood Based Industries (WBI) have played an important role in the promotion of agroforestry and economy in Punjab, Haryana, western U.P and in Uttarakhand. However, over the years, the regulations governing the WBI have become stringent. The procedure for setting up new units is cumbersome.
The way forward
The National Agroforestry Policy has pointed the way forward to foster innovation in tree-based farming systems, among various stakeholders.
For lawmakers this would mean amending unfavourable legislation and simplifying regulations related to forestry and agriculture. Policymakers are to incorporate agroforestry in all policies relating to land use and natural resource management, and encourage government investments in agroforestry-related infrastructure, research and education and in the establishment of sustainable enterprises. Development administrators are to develop an institutional framework to ensure coordination between various elements of agroforestry scattered in existing missions and programmes. Farmers are to demand improved agroforestry science and technology from the public research and extension systems, loan and insurance products from financial institutions, and adopt suitable varieties and agronomic practices. Scientists and researchers are to develop location-specific tree-based technologies that complement the crop and livestock systems for sustainable livelihoods, factor in gender concerns, and incorporate the feedback from local communities.
Extension agents, NGOs and farmer organisations are to demonstrate new technologies, build capacities of farmers and help in linking producers to markets and value chains. The private sector is to invest in agroforestry both as a commercial enterprise as well as through the route of Corporate Social Responsibility. Finally, the media is to communicate the benefits of agroforestry to user communities.
Farmers have encapsulated the essence of agroforestry in a pithy slogan “har medh par pedh”(trees on every field boundary). It is time for others to turn over a new leaf. The challenge now lies in the detail of crafting a road map for the implementation of the National Agroforestry Policy by the new government.

Regional dynamics in ISIS fight: The road to Damascus passes through Ankaraprint
The Turkish parliament’s vote in favour of a cross-border military action is a force multiplier in Syria for the US and Nato. The Assad regime’s warning that it breaches Syrian sovereignty is unlikely to deter the West. Yet whether Turkey will acquiesce to becoming Nato’s cat’s paw is debatable.
That depends on the blowback it anticipates domestically from its diverse ethnic constituents, which include 15 million Kurds and about 10 million Alevis (akin to the Alawis of Syria), who have remained largely quiescent so far. Further deep-seated animosities against the Turk in the Arab world could tactically bring together contesting Arab Syrian opposition groups. 
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has outlined three objectives of the military action: Create a buffer zone within Syria to relieve pressure from unending refugees; topple the Assad regime; and support the peace process with the Turkish Kurds led by PKK’s Abdulla Ocalan. There are unstated goals too: Strengthen proxy Syrian Sunni opposition groups to prepare them for power and prevent ISIS from crossing into Turkey. It is a scenario pregnant with possibilities, all of which accord not surprisingly with American and Western priorities.
The Turkish exhortation to ease its difficulty of succouring two million refugees inside its territory and stemming the flow is reason enough for a military operation into Syria. Turkey has limited options unless ISIS stops its violence. UN Security Council resolutions on Syria already allow cross-border humanitarian aid without the regime’s sanction. The next step could well be a limited operation for establishing a safe haven inside Syria, possibly with a no-fly zone with support from Nato partners. It will be easy to sell it internationally. Turkey’s entry will effectively obliterate the border with Syria just as ISIS has succeeded in doing so with the Syria-Iraq border.
Nevertheless, if needed, a pretext for military action already exists: The security of the Turkish exclave in northern Syria and the mausoleum of Suleyman Shah, the grandfather of Osman I, the founder of the Ottoman dynasty. Erdogan has promised retaliation in case ISIS attacks the 40 Turkish soldiers guarding the shrine.
However, Turkish military operations against ISIS still remain a major problem. Quite apart from the flexibility in manoeuvre, tactics and weaponry that a non-State actor can muster, the duration of the engagement cannot be predicted. It will have to look forward to a long stay in the trenches without any guarantee of success. Turkey could well prefer to work through its armed Syrian proxies. Further, the costs of a frontal assault on ISIS could also prompt charges of killing co-religionists. At the same time a degree of intelligence coordination with the Assad regime appears indispensable for military success. Yet this remains outside the bounds of possibility.
Turkish entry is a mixed blessing for the Assad regime. Turkey is unlikely to take on the Syrian Army frontally, regardless of its relative superiority, lest it get charged with invasion. Rather, Turkey will aim to indirectly weaken and dissipate the Assad regime. It would put pressure by reducing the regime’s area of effective control including the major south-north communication arteries. By whittling down the regime’s support base it could provoke a renewed exodus towards the buffer zone. Much will depend on the extent to which Russia and Iran remain ready to shore up the Assad regime. Turkey’s military entry will exacerbate the political and religious churning in the region and a pliable Sunni-led government in Damascus seems the most probable outcome, which will anoint Turkey as the kingmaker in Syria.
This phase in the conflict will see the beginning of the re-drawing of borders in West Asia probably along confessional lines. Thanks to US support we could also see a larger Kurdish entity emerging beyond the autonomous region of Iraqi Kurdistan to include Kurds from Syria and Turkey and eventually Iran.

Ebola  most serious  health emergency in years: world leadersprint
The Ebola epidemic is "the most serious international public health emergency in recent years", British, US, French, German and Italian leaders agreed in a conference call on Wednesday.
A 75-minute video conference call between British Prime Minister David Cameron, French President Francois Hollande, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and US President Barack Obama focused on cooperation to fight the outbreak, a spokesperson for Cameron said.

"Leaders agreed that this was the most serious international public health emergency in recent years and that the international community needed to do much more and faster to halt the rise of the disease in the region," the British PM's office said in a statement.
"Each leader set out what they are doing to help the countries affected and then discussions focused on how to improve coordination of the international effort."
Cameron proposed that plans to tackle the disease could be decided at a Friday summit in Milan between European and Asian leaders and a European Council meeting next week.
The call comes after reports that a second healthcare worker in Texas in the United States tested positive for Ebola after caring for a Liberian patient who died of the virus in Dallas.

The United Nations also warned Ebola was outpacing efforts to combat the disease and said the world should dramatically expand the fight against the tropical fever, which has killed nearly 4,500 people this year, mainly in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.
In a unanimously adopted statement, the 15-member body warned that the world's response "has failed to date".
Cameron said that he would welcome any other countries who wanted to contribute to British efforts to fight the disease in Sierra Leone, and would discuss cooperation with Italy.
The discussion identified priorities of improving coordination of international efforts, increasing spending and trained personnel working the region affected, and evacuation procedures for workers infected with the disease.
The leaders also discussed the fight against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria and peace efforts in Ukraine.
The leaders said "the international coalition was making progress" in Iraq, but that more should be done to train local forces in Iraq and Syria to fight the group.
On the topic of Ukraine, the leaders agreed that Russia should respect a ceasefire and stop a cross-border flow of weapons and come to an energy supply agreement in Ukraine.
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian leader Petro Poroshenko are to meet in Milan on Friday to try to settle a disagreement over gas supplies and broker an end to months of conflict in east Ukraine.
Ebola death toll close to 4,500: WHO 
Almost 4,500 people have died in the Ebola epidemic that broke out in west Africa at the start of the year, according to fresh figures released Wednesday the World Health Organization.
The WHO said that as of October 12, 4,493 people have died from Ebola out of a total of 8,997 registered cases in seven countries.
The last official WHO toll, valid to October 8, put the figures at 4,033 dead from 8,399 cases. The seven countries are split into two groups by WHO. The first includes Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- by far the worst-affected nations.
The second includes Nigeria, Senegal, Spain and United States, which have seen a small number of highly isolated cases. Liberia has been hardest-hit, with 4,249 cases and 2,458 deaths, followed by Sierra Leone with 3,252 cases and 1,183 deaths. Guinea, where the epidemic originated in December, has seen 1,472 cases and 843 deaths.
Health workers continue to pay a heavy price as they battle the epidemic, with 236 deaths out of 427 cases across the countries. A total of 96 health workers have died in Liberia, 95 in Sierra Leone, 40 in Guinea, and five in Nigeria. Nigeria's overall toll remained unchanged at eight dead from 20 cases.
WHO has said it will be declared Ebola-free on October 20 if it has no further cases. In the United States there have been two cases, one of them fatal. Spain has one case of infection.
The toll remained unchanged in Senegal with one case. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, hit by a separate strain of Ebola from the one raging in west Africa, the WHO said there have been 71 cases and 43 deaths up to October 7.

Rupee falls 31 paise against US dollar to one-week lowTracking equity markets, the Indian rupee on Tuesday wiped out initial gains and ended 31 paise down at a one-week low of 61.41 against the greenback on fresh dollar demand from banks and importers.
Persistent foreign capital outflows also affected the rupee sentiment, forex dealers said.
The rupee opened higher at 60.94 per dollar as against the last closing level of 61.10 per dollar at the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) Market on initial selling of dollars by banks following overnight losses in the New York market.
However, the rupee washed out initial gains and ended lower at 61.41 per dollar on heavy dollar demand from importers in view of a firm dollar overseas, registering a loss of 31 paise or 0.51%.
Intra-day, it moved in a range of 60.93 per dollar and 61.46 per dollar. Tuesday's closing of 61.41 is the lowest since 61.43 on October 7.
"Supported by lower CPI and WPI data for September the rupee started the Tuesday session strongly... Demand for dollars from defence companies and importers weakened the rupee. The fall was arrested on reports of RBI selling dollars in the spot market. Caution remained ahead of elections in Maharashtra state on Wednesday," said Suresh Nair, director, Admisi Forex.
In London markets on Tuesday, the dollar recovered its footing in Europe after falling to its lowest in a month against the yen amid deepening worries over global growth and a sell-off in equities.
Meanwhile, the Indian stock benchmark Sensex ended lower by 34.74 points, or 0.13%, to end at 26,349.33.
Forex and money markets will remain closed on Wednesday on account of voting for single-phase Assembly elections in Maharashtra.
Pramit Brahmbhatt, CEO, Veracity Group said, the rupee reversed all gains after trading at its highest level since September 23.
In forwards market, premium recovered on fresh payments from banks and corporates.
The benchmark six-month premium payable in March moved up to 215.5-217.5 paise from 214-216 paise on Monday.
Far-forward contracts maturing in September, 2015 also went up to 442-444 paise from 440-442 paise.
The Reserve Bank of India fixed the reference rate for dollar at 61.1078 and for the Euro at 77.6802.
The rupee recovered against the pound to 97.86 from the previous close of 98.40, while it settled at 57.52 per 100 Japanese yen from 56.95.
However, it fell back against the euro to 77.72 from 77.52 on Monday.

The benchmark Sensex on Tuesday washed out initial gains and ended nearly 35 points down at 26,349.33 on selling in realty, IT, consumer durable shares amid investors adopting caution ahead of key state elections.
Fall in retail inflation and wholesale price rise, which hit a five-year low in September, as well as better than expected earnings from RIL initially boosted markets but losses in HDFC, Tata Motors, ITC, HDFC Bank, ONGC and TCS dragged the Sensex into the red.

India loses WTO dispute over bird flu curbs on US poultryIndia loses WTO dispute over bird flu curbs on US poultry

The World Trade Organization (WTO) on Tuesday handed India a major setback ruling against its ban on US poultry products, calling it “inconsistent” with international norms and lacking scientific basis.
The ruling has the potential to significantly destabilise Indian poultry industry, and domestic producers fear they will be at grave risk against their better organised Americans rivals.
By US estimates American poultry produces are losing close to $300 million in annual business because of the ban India imposed seven year ago to check against avian influenza.
“India's Avian Influenza measures are inconsistent with (several articles)....of the SPS (sanitary and phyto-sanitary) Agreement because they are not based on the relevant international standard,” a WTO panel ruled in Geneva.
Indian officials said they will “study and review the ruling”, but the government they will be under pressure to appeal, or announce additional steps to protect domestic producers.
Poultry Federation of India Chairman JS Dhull said that the order would have a major impact on the domestic industry if the government does not take some other remedial measures like anti-dumping duty or increase in import duty.
The US was quick to welcome the ruling. “This is a major victory for American farmers,” said US trade representative Mike Froman in a statement.
“The WTO panel agreed with the US case that India lacks any scientific basis to restrict US agricultural products, including US poultry products.”
The US took the issue to WTO in 2012, challenging the ban.
“The United States, however, has not had an outbreak of high pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) since 2004, while during that same interval India has had over 90 HPAI outbreaks,” the US said.

Aditya birla group may bid for Holcim  Lafarge LAT AM assetsAditya birla group may bid for Holcim, Lafarge LAT AM assets

The Kumar Mangalam Birla-led Aditya Birla Group is reportedly among several companies preparing a bid for assets being sold by Holcim and Lafarge as a part of the merger of the two European cement majors.
Aditya Birla Group, which owns Ultratech Cement, is considering submitting a bid by next week’s deadline for the assets, and it is particularly interested in Holcim and Lafarge’s Latin American operations, Bloomberg news agency reported on Tuesday citing unnamed people with knowledge of the matter.
It could be Aditya Birla Group’s biggest acquisition deal after Hindalco acquired Canadian aluminium maker Novelis in 2007 for nearly $6 billion ( Rs. 36,846 crore).
Holcim and Lafarge are selling assets with an enterprise value of €5-7 billion in order to get clearances for the deal from competition regulators around the world.
A spokesperson for Aditya Birla Group refused to comment on market speculation. 
Switzerland-based Holcim had in April this year unveiled a deal to buy France’s Lafarge, a move that would create the world’s biggest cement maker with $44 billion in annual sales.
Ultratech, which has an installed cement capacity of 62 million tonnes, has been expanding its operations and building scale.

Enforcement Directorate (ED) may soon impose a penalty on e-commerce major Flipkart after it conducted a probe on the company’s trade practices. The extent of penalty is yet to be ascertained while some speculate it would be to the tune of Rs. 1000 crore.
ED, which probes financial irregularities, mainly money laundering and foreign exchange rule violations, is also probing other e-commerce companies, according to people within the organisation.

“The quantum of irregularity has been calculated. The investigation is still on. We are yet to fix a penalty,” said highly placed sources at Enforcement Directorate. “We are probing other businesses as well because of which we cannot reveal what we have learned about Flipkart…It will alert others,” he said on condition of anonymity.
“We are in complete compliance with the laws of the land and will cooperate with authorities when required,” Flipkart spokesperson responded.
Sources in the e-commerce industry said ED had, two months ago, sent an enquiry note to several companies asking about the sales model. Flipkart’s rival Amazon said “We are fully compliant with the regulators”.

Terror threats: Banks  markets tighten scrutinyComments
With increased threats to India from global terror outfits such as Al Qaeda and Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (Isis), Indian banks have tightened their scrutiny over deposits.
Sources said that while Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is set to look into the issue, the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) will soon issue a circular asking banks to keep an eye on high value transactions. The circular will also outline details and additional measures that banks would be required to adopt for monitoring these transactions.
“Banks are geared up for this and while this is an on-going process, the IBA is looking into it considering the fresh threats from these outfits and would soon issue a guideline,” TM Bhasin, chairman, IBA told HT.
After the recent explosion in Burdwan, West Bengal that was traced to Indian Mujahideen and Al Qaeda, a senior government official said that while the security agencies are doing their job, banks have also been asked to be alert.
Most banks have already installed know your customer and anti-money laundering softwares to detect and monitor suspicious transactions. Transactions of over Rs. 1 lakh in a day or Rs. 10 lakh in a month are already being monitored.
Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has also circulated a fresh list of terror outfits to the stock exchanges and asked market entities to keep a close watch on transactions to ensure that the terror outfits do not find their way into Indian capital markets.
“Sebi has informed the exchange about the amendments/addition to UNSC’s Al-Qaida Sanctions List … members are advised to take note of the above and ensure compliance with the same,” BSE said in a circular released last week.
Isis is a terror outfit which controls significant portions of northern Syria and Iraq, where it established the Islamic State caliphate in June this year. ISIS also controls oil-production in this region.

WPI inflation hits 5-year low of 2.38% on cheaper food pricesComments
India’s wholesale inflation rate plunged to 2.38% in September, the lowest in five years, aided by a sharp drop in vegetable and petrol prices, data released on Tuesday showed, rekindling hopes that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will cut interest rates soon.
The more than one percentage point drop in wholesale inflation rates over August’s 3.74% should bring cheer to the NDA government, which rode to a landslide election victory promising to bring down prices of essentials as part of its poll pledge to usher in ‘Aachen din’ (good days).
“It is heartening to note that we have been able to bring food inflation under control. Growth in vegetable and protein prices that have been contributing to the recent increase in inflation rates have shrunk thanks to the steps taken by the government,” finance minister Arun Jaitley said.
Wholesale food inflation, a measure of how costly the platter has become, grew 3.52% compared to the previous month’s 5.15%. Wholesale vegetable prices fell 14.98% in September on a year-on-year basis, while onion prices plunged 58.12%.
“We are committed to continuing reforms in food markets that will improve supply responses and keep inflation low and stable. At the same time, fiscal consolidation and a new monetary policy framework will help bring down inflationary expectations. We are confident that soon we will be achieving a low and stable inflation rate,” he said.
It was also the lowest since 1.79% of October 2009, a period when demand for goods fell sharply battered by the worst global recession in 80 years.
Besides, with crude oil prices falling to below $90 a barrel, expect retail diesel prices to come down further.
On Tuesday, the government cut retail petrol prices by more than Rs. 1 a litre.
Manufactured products inflation — a broad index to gauge price movements of industrial goods — was lower at 2.84% in September compared to August’s 3.45%, but still higher than last September’s 2.36%.
Retail inflation also eased in September to 6.46% year-on-year from 7.73% in the previous month, data showed last week, although that is still above the central bank’s target of 6% by 2016.
The RBI, which has maintained status quo in interest rate since January, will review its monetary policy on December 2.
The RBI primarily factors in the retail inflation while framing the monetary policy.

Congress wants the diesel price brought down to the December 2010 level of Rs. 37.75
The Congress joined the Left parties on Tuesday in demanding a reduction in the diesel price in line with the fall in crude oil prices in the international market.
Pointing out that the price of crude oil was at a 46-month low, the Congress said this benefit should be transferred to the consumers.
Newly appointed party spokesman Ajoy Kumar demanded that the diesel price be brought down to the December 2010 level of Rs. 37.75.
The CPI(M) earlier this month made out a similar case.
“Instead the OMCs are reportedly earning Rs. 1.90 on every litre of diesel as over-recovery,” the party reiterated at its Polit Bureau meeting here on Tuesday.

IndiGo on Wednesday placed an order for 250 single-aisle aircraft, valued at $25.70 billion (Rs.1.50 lakh crore), at $102.8 million per aircraft.
The airline and its two co-founders U.S.-based NRI Rakesh Gangwal and InterGlobe Enterprises’ Group Managing Director Rahul Bhatia entered into an MoU with Airbus SA to buy 250 Airbus A320neo Family aircraft.
“This order reaffirms IndiGo’s commitment to the long-term development of affordable air transportation. The additional aircraft will enable us to continue to bring our low fares and courteous, hassle-free service to more customers and markets and will create more job opportunities,” IndiGo President Aditya Ghosh said in a statement.
IndiGo bid to give hassle-free service
IndiGo President Aditya Ghosh has said that the airline’s order of 250 Airbus A320neo aircraft, “Reaffirms IndiGo’s commitment to the long-term development of affordable air transportation in India and overseas.”
“The additional aircraft will enable us to continue to bring our low fares and courteous, hassle-free service to more customers and markets and will create more job opportunities and growth,” he said in a statement.
“The A320neo continues to dominate world market share, and this commitment confirms the A320 Family as the aircraft of choice in the most dynamic aviation growth markets,” said Airbus President and CEO Fabrice Brégier.
Engine selection for this order is not expected to be made in the near future.
This is the biggest ever aircraft order placed by IndiGo as well as by any Indian carrier. In mid- 2005, a year before its launch, IndiGo had placed an order for 100 Airbus A320ceo aircraft, taking everyone in the aviation industry by surprise. It was only due to the involvement of Mr. Gangwal, the Kolkata-born former CEO and Chairman of U.S. Airways Group in IndiGo that Airbus agreed to take that order from a start-up, low cost airline.
In 2011, IndiGo placed another large order for 180 A320neo aircraft, valued at $15 billion. At present, IndiGo has a fleet of 83 A320s and operates 540 daily flights.
The large aircraft order is to get aircraft at competitive prices to meet its ambitious growth plans as well as to take on competition from new entrants and incumbent airlines.
IndiGo is the only profitable airline from India and reportedly made a profit of Rs.317 crore last year.
The induction of A320neo aircraft is expected improve its profitability.

Meet the man who translated legal papers in Jayalalithaa caseEYE BROWSE
I will never forget translating Tamizhnattu’s Favourite Lady
The very lightly embroidered true story of how a bunch of Bangalore college lecturers got involved in building the case against J Jayalalithaa.

For one or two days after Justice John Michael D’Cunha’s judgment convicting Tamizh Naad Chief Minister Jayalalithaa in the disproportionate assets case, people known to me would come and try to give me shake-hand like I did something big. Others said things like you were involved in that case, is it and I tried hard to look serious and not open my mouth to spoil the big impression they were having of me. Anyway, what could I say to correct them? That I went and sat at one table for a long time every day, and could not do my usual evening reading because of eye-strain. That I did not feel important at any point, only puzzled and frightened at the beginning, then bored and also worried, and very relieved when it was over. That it felt little bit like going to jail. Or, more accurately, like being stuck in some relative’s house where you have to be very polite. Maybe you will understand better if I begin at the beginning.
One Tuesday afternoon in October 2004, as I was sitting in my department and waiting for the bell to ring for the post-lunch class to start, I saw a peon sprint up to our door from the office. The Director of Collegiate Education wants to talk to you, he said. Come quickly to the office, I’ve left the phone off the hook.
I couldn’t have sprinted even if I wanted to, so I let him sprint back, and made my way, hastening slowly, as it were, to the receptionist’s window from where I would be handed the black Bakelite receiver through the bars. If you understand the labyrinthine complexities of higher education in Karnataka, you will understand the air of disbelief with which I approached the whole thing. Bill Gates might call Microsoft people and say hello how are you what are you doing for Microsoft today, but The Director of Collegiate Education is a grand panjandrum, sits inside a stone building that was once some royal’s property in British days, now guarded by several watchmen, within acres of garden, his office tended to by a secretary and several support staff, their office surrounded by several rooms where minions sit typing, pushing files and shepherding courses, careers and years of dust. Plus there is proper hierarchy. Commissioner, then Director, then joint directors for different regions, then officers on special duty, then principals of government and private colleges, then lecturers in government colleges, and finally us private college fellows, like ants. Every time some director puts his foot down, three of us will die.
For such an august personage to pick up a phone and dial a private Bangalore college and ask to talk to the tail of their Humanities Department was just as likely as Queen Victoria jumping off her statue near Cubbon Park and coming to my home to ring my doorbell to ask if I wanted to go and do a by-two tea inside a Brahmin hotel under a board which said no fractional service. Anyway when I picked up the phone and said hello, there was only the dying animal sound of a disconnected call. I got teased about it for the rest of that day. One colleague said, you’re a big man now, when the Director calls again tell him please release my promotion arrears they are pending from 1994. I let out a strangulation noise to let him know I was appreciating his humor and his hopeful request and the delicate way in which the two combined for a leg-pull.
The next day did not offer so many opportunities for laughter. By the time Thursday came around, everybody had forgotten about it, and all parties had gone back to sleepwalking routine, no humor, nor sprinting. Then on Friday morning, I was accosted in the corridors by a colleague and told that Principal wanted to meet me, most urgent, I could consider my morning class cancelled.
   * * *
So I went, and was asked to sit, and then the Principal said we have received this fax, you please write a letter complying with the order that it contains immediately. We are a private college, sir, the fax is directly from Commissioner of Higher Education, madam is very strict, if we don’t give prompt response then movement of files and salary bill becomes a problem. So I said yes sir, and I read the fax. It said go immediately to such and such a room in the City Civil Court, and report to Professor S who is coordinating translation team. You have to be there only till further orders from this office. So I took a white sheet, put the date, said to Madam Commissioner through Principal, today forthwith I am reporting, and I made two copies of the letter, gave one to him and left. You have to do everything in writing with officials, otherwise tomorrow they will say what order, who gave, what proof and all, and withhold pension, benefits etc and make you run from pillar to post.
City Civil Court is a multi-storey building next to Cauvery Bhavan, opposite Central College, just a stone’s throw from State Bank of Mysore and Avenue Road. For a long time it was pink in color, then it became light-brown, and various other colors. I have many memories here, my parents did register marriage here, and then they went to the next building, which had Woodlands restaurant, and they ate ice-cream there, with their friends who had come as witnesses. Later I had to come to the Family Court in the same building to file for divorce, and sat through three or four sessions, and went for reconciliation, before the matter ended.
So I went, and found the room, but the coordinator was not there – he had gone to the Commissioner’s Office to send more faxes because some people had not yet reported. The court officer took my joining report, and said please fill your name in the register, you have to sign here for attendance every day, and this copy will go to Finance Department and Collegiate Education. So I did all that, and then they assigned me one chair and table, and said you have to do translation work. As I began, Prof S arrived, and said welcome sir, this is Jayalalithaa Case, all of us have been deputed here because documents are in Tamizh and case has been transferred to Karnataka, so all of us have to translate. There were about 20 people, including both pre-university teachers and college teachers, summoned from one-man or one-woman Tamizh departments. Many were familiar faces, because people in my family have been Tamizh teachers.
Anyhow, that was my two-minute orientation program, and I sat down and started translating the document given to me. It was some deposition about giving power of attorney over some land to some person. I had to read it at least ten times, because the language used in courts is very different from idiomatic Tamizh. The syntax is at least 100 years old, so in the very first sentence you will get every life detail of the deponent except his pincode and I spent half an hour trying to get all these details into one English sentence. Terms used in land-related documents tend to be archaic Tamizh, or dialect-words, or even Persian sometimes. I somehow managed, and showed it to the coordinator and he okayed it.
On the very first day, I learnt a new Tamizh word – villangam. A senior professor explained it to me in Tamizh as difficulties hindering any smooth transaction in land matters, and I translated it as ‘impediment’. When I went home and asked, they said ‘encumbrance’, and I checked it up. I spent a few days replacing hindrance, difficulty, and my own impediment in already translated documents with the accepted word. I began to learn as many as five to ten new words in my own language every day as a result of this deputation.
That very first afternoon I got the answer to one question that was playing inside my head like in the olden days movies with echo effect. How did Commissioner come to know my name and that Tamizh is known to me? I was thinking not bad, these fellows know all small things, they must be keeping full watch otherwise how it can be possible. Also, little fear, because all of us do some small things, who wants higher-ups to know all this.
While I was struggling over my maiden translation, I got an answer to my question. Every now and then, Coordinator would say we need five more people at least, who can be called. And immediately everybody will stop translating and brainstorming session will start. In a minute somebody would say Oh yes, so-and-so in such-and-such department is a Tamizh-knowing person. Coordinator would check his list and immediately become happy and say very good ma, very good, if name was not there. Usually only lady staff were making useful suggestions. They were very well-informed about these things – who knows how many languages, which he can able to read, write, speak. Then Coordinator will take list to Commissioner’s office and faxes will start flying.
Our number increased because of this to about 22, and I lost all illusions about how much anybody in any office knew about their staff and also because I now understood that I didn’t have to get arrears for anyone.
Later when I went home and told my parents, they said what is this headache job, you can’t even say no, and god knows what will happen tomorrow. Don’t tell anybody that you are doing this, and be careful, some AThiMuKa fellow might trouble you, or some Amma-veriyan (loyalist) if you go to Tamizh Nadu. Jakkirathai! Also this is a sensitive matter, don’t tell anybody anything, if more people come to know, we cannot predict what will happen. Straightaway higher-ups will put a hand in your service register, and then lifelong irritation will happen. So while I could not hide it in the college, I was careful not to reveal any details to anybody.
When the newspapers announced that the case was shifting to Karnataka, I had paid only limited attention, because who knew how it will become a Jumbo Jet landing in my courtyard. Now I went and found out whatever little details about the case from newspapers and Internet. I also looked at some legal documents in English just to get idea of how the wordings are done.
Next day, Coordinator called me and said see, you need not do translation any more, you are a humanities person plus you have knowledge of both languages, we want you to do a more responsible job. You have to be one of the scrutinizers. Three more English professors are coming as scrutinizers. When I heard important, I just said yes. Later I realized what a high risk it was. I have to read every translation and certify. There were all sorts of documents to go through – affidavits , exhibits, press-notes about a wedding, depositions, stamp-papers, bills, voluntary statements, unmarked documents, responses by defendants, government documents about seized properties, reports from raids accompanied by annexures containing detailed lists of what was found. It was quite challenging and my anxiety began to grow. Maybe in court the defendant’s legal team will say objection, then I have to go for cross-examination. My days of tension began, and I would go over every document three times, and sometimes while sleeping I would get bad dreams where some lawyer is pointing out some error, and everybody in court is laughing, even the police constables on security duty, and the judge, everybody except the defendant who is staring severely at me as if they want to memorize my face. I followed the occasional newspaper accounts of this case, and one time the defence lawyers made some complaint about translation quality. I slept badly for a fortnight after that.
Later I understood why this scrutiny happened. First there was some delay in transferring the case, because evidence had to be securely sent to Bangalore. Then they would have woken up and found out that all documents pertaining to the case were in Tamizh and had to be translated. When they looked at the volume and calculated the expense to get it done professionally, they might have balked. Especially because they were still discussing how to meet expenses incurred with the other state government. Sometimes I wonder about who came up with the genius idea of drafting the Tamizh teaching community in Bangalore to do the job. Because our fellows are undoubtedly strong in Tamizh, but not so much in English, because no part of their job requires them to transact in English, leave alone legal English. The first few translations would have had many issues. At this point, they would have decided to draft some scrutinizers also.
On the second day, somebody said Coordinator sir, what is our remuneration. So he asked, and found they were giving Rs 5 per typed page. Immediately a buzz of anger went around the room, and this was discussed, and finally one letter to the judge was drafted, saying we want Rs 20 per page and more for scrutiny, and given to Coordinator. Fifteen minutes later, the judge came and said Namaste, I hope you are comfortable, that you have everything you need, and everybody stood up, and smiled nicely, and said yes sir, no problem, sir. Later, they asked coordinator why he didn’t give letter at that moment. It did not strike me he said. He later met the judge, and handed over our demands. The judge said he will forward to competent authority for suitable action.
About a week later, our numbers fell, because all the Pre-University teachers stopped coming. Their board sent an order saying that they were required for exam work because supplementaries had started. We were now only 15 people. Some people got agitated and said what is the quantum of work per person, how many documents are there, what is the time-frame for the task. They were upset because there did not seem to be a plan. Prof K stood up and said to Coordinator, this is disorganized, why are you wasting our time like this. Prof S tried to defend, but the other man said, please don’t talk to me till you have proper information. Plus we were only given Xerox copies, which were sometimes hard to read and translate because the Xerox was too light. We had some court staff to help us, two or three typists, and an officer, a Tamizh-knowing man. He said, see, we can’t give a number like that. Some documents are handwritten, some are receipts, some are sworn depositions running to several pages. Everything is a document. Rough estimate it will take about six to eight weeks. Definitely we will make Xeroxes little bit darker, regret that we cannot give the originals for security reasons. Everybody then started work again happily.
So a new routine started for us. Everyone would arrive by 10.15am, 10.30am, and go sign for documents in the tray and start the work. By 11.30 tea and Marie biscuits would arrive, and a five-minute break was taken, people chitchatting about what they were doing, their children etc. At 1pm, pens down for lunch-break, the same boring lunch every day, veg pulao, raita and two pakodas. Yet nobody complained because this lunch-break was a good discussion time, people would say, my god, I was taken aback today, or I read deposition by Sivaji Ganesan today, such a humble man. Poor fellow, they dragged him to court and all. Back to work by 1.30pm, one more tea-break at 3pm, then work till 4.30, 5pm. That was also the time when the Kanchi Shankaracharyas got arrested by Madam Jayalalithaa’s government, so for some two weeks this was the hot topic of lunchtime discussion, some pro-Swamijis, some pro-Madam. Now and then, the court people would also tell us stories, how present judge is a nice man, but he was retiring in one year’s time, so the case will get delayed again till new judge comes. How the defendant escaped in some previous case, that judge said there has been wrongdoing, but Madam must apologize and make amends. Wah wah, some courts are giving moral science lessons and gentle taps on the knuckles. Something would have been given somewhere, some knowledgeable person said. They gave us a different room, after the first week. This was more spacious, less congested, everybody got a table, plus there was a big worktable where some people sat together and worked.
My own routine was not so easy. After the first month, I understood that this will take long time, so I went and met principal in college, and told him the timeframe is uncertain, so I will take morning classes, and he said okay. I would take first hour every day, full of bright enthusiastic faces in the class, and then go from this hopeful place to the court, struggle to find parking for my two-wheeler, and walk past police vans with groups of chained undertrials being taken to court, and sit in a room and ignore the typical government office smell, whitewash, dust, old files, faraway urine, and work on my files. I had to rewrite rather than scrutinize very often because all the translators were not of the same caliber. Reading all these documents was bit strenuous for me, both physically, because I had to examine a faded Xerox, then read the translation. Apart from the eye-strain, also because of their contents, how power was used, whether allegedly or truly. Something happened to me inside, a strain on my soul. I was working on my PhD then, the writing work came to a standstill. I was unable to proceed.
We began work in the middle of October 2004. When we finally finished and got our relieving orders, it was June 2005. Some 2,000-3,000 documents were translated, by estimate – we never got the actual number. We also did not receive either the promised or the requested remuneration. I met one of the people from that group a couple of years later, and he complained bitterly about the non-payment. I said, leave it, be happy that the Directorate paid your salary promptly, they could have said City Civil Court should pay you for the time of deputation. He looked at me aghast, as if to ask the question which place has this man come from.
I have been sent on election duty several times, and I see parallels between such work, and this task. Orders are given, some sketchy instructions, to ordinary people, who must in the midst of their lives and problems find some reserve of competence and sincerity to complete the task. Perhaps it is a miracle that it is completed.
I may have disappointed some people who expected juicy revelations. There were several such, but it would not be appropriate for me to reveal them. After all, this was a confidential job entrusted to me, and I have to respect that. Plus, in some sense, the matter is still sub judice. It is for courts to decide, what is true and what is not. We are not competent in that regard.

When we look at J. Jayalalithaa’s career as a politician, I am reminded of what a novelist from another country calls ‘ the revenge of the novel ’. In her case, we are witnessing ‘the revenge of the heroine’. Just as fiction permeates every aspect of life in that country because the rulers once prohibited fiction, we have in Madam a person who is remaking political life in Tamizh Nadu in a sort of vengeance for the many years of not being taken seriously as a performer. If you look at the roles she was given, she was always typecast, and never had a role of substance since the industry did not take women seriously. As a person of caliber and great intelligence, she had limited roles that insulted her abilities thrust upon her. Politics in Tamizh Nadu was once ideology driven by cinema. Then MGR arrived, and ideology dwindled into slogans. Jayalalitha’s revenge has been to turn politics into cinema, and in this respect she has even outshone her mentor, MGR. After all, it was only possible for him to be CM and win elections. He could not lose, and there was never any opportunity for any court to punish him, nor any chance for the electorate to forgive him. Jayalalitha has done all that.
She has been writing her own script, and directing her own film titled Tamizh Nadu CM since the year 1989, when she finally won control over AIADMK, and since then people have only had the option of applauding. Nobody in the country can match her when it comes to making politics look cinematic, not even Narendra Modi, who needs speech writers in English and PR fellows to tweak Star Wars references towards maximizing his public appeal. For her, language is not a barrier. She knows this, and when she said Gujarathu Modi-ya? Tamizhnattu intha Lady-ya? (Do you want Gujarat’s Modi? Or Tamizh Naad’s lady?), it was not merely rhetoric, it was a revelation that politics is only rhetoric. No ideology can trip her up, whether Hindutva or Gundutva – her talent for reengineering ‘issues of people’s welfare’ and making them look like her ideas is established. When, once in five years, the people of Tamizh Naad take the choice of changing the channel, she knows at which moment to find her way into the new program and make it her film. So whatever the judgment, and its ultimate fall-out, the person writing that script and staging the surprises can only be Jayalalithaa, till Time decides to pull its own surprises.

12 companies launch public offers in Sept; highest ever in a monthUpdated: October 15, 2014 18:31 IST
12 companies launch public offers in Sept; highest ever in a month
PTI
business enterprises
Tapping strong investor sentiments, as many as 12 small and medium enterprises came out with their IPOs in September — the highest in a single month since the launch of dedicated SME platforms in March 2012.
The SMEs, most of them to be listed on BSE SME platform, had come out with their initial public offering (IPO) to together raise atleast Rs. 81 crore.
Top bourses — the BSE and the NSE — had launched dedicated platforms for SMEs in March 2012 to enable the listing of these firms and help them raise equity capital for growth and expansion in a cost—effective manner.
Among the 12 firms that hit the capital markets with their IPOs in September, Momai Apparels topped the chart with Rs. 30 crore initial share sale. The firm is the only one proposed to be listed on NSE’s platform for SMEs — NSE Emerge, among the 12 companies.
The remaining 11 IPOs —— Naysaa Securities, Sirohia & Sons, Encash Entertainment, Ultracab (India), Aryaman Capital Markets, Atishay Infotech, Dhabriya Polywood, Starlit Power Systems, Vibrant Global Capital, Powerhouse Fitness & Realty, and ADCC Infocad —— would trade on the BSE SME segment.
According to market experts, current market conditions are favourable for companies looking to mop up funds through the IPO route.
BSE Managing Director and CEO Ashish Kumar Chauhan had recently said that as many 100 companies were expected to be listed on the exchange’s SME platform by the year—end.
Currently, 70 companies are eligible for trading on the BSE SME platform and have an aggregate market capitalisation of a little over Rs. 7,563 crore.
On the other hand, five firms are listed on the NSE.
According to the SME listing norms, a company would be eligible for listing if it has not completed 10 years after incorporation, and its revenue has not exceeded Rs. 100 crore in any of the financial years.
In addition, the company should have got an investment of at least Rs. 50 lakh by an alternative investment fund, or a venture capital fund, or by a merchant banker, or an angel investor, or a specialised international multilateral agency, or a public financial institution, among other such investors.
The data for September has been gathered through information available on the SEBI’s website.

Scientists find potential medicine for treating arthritisScientists find potential medicine for treating arthritis
Vanita Srivastava , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 15, 2014

Scientists at Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine (IIIM), Jammu have discovered a new chemical compound in a Himalayan plant which has the potential to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases.
IIIM scientists isolated a natural product from the plant Bergenia ciliata and then through medicinal chemistry, created a chemical with potent anti-arthritic activity. This discovery has been published last week by the American Chemical Society in its journal.
“This compound exhibits dual action -- inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines and blocking pain receptors. Lab scale experiments have been completed and pharmacological activity has been confirmed for anti-arthritis activities. The next stage would be to conduct the clinical trial of the drug molecule,” Dr Ram Vishwakarma, director IIIM, Jammu said.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common age-related chronic disease, characterised mainly by inflammation of the lining of the joints. Statistical data shows people with RA are two times more likely to die than people of the same age without RA.
The medicinal plant from which this compound was discovered, Bergenia ciliate, has been used for centuries in the Ayurvedic medicine to treat kidney and bladder stones, piles, and pulmonary affections.
Taking queue from the available traditional knowledge, scientists synthesised a compound, IS-01246, which displayed positive results both in in-vitro as well as in-vivo inflammation and rheumatoid arthritis models.

The deficit stood at $483 billion in the year that ended September 30, a decline of 29 percent from the 2013 fiscal year shortfall of $680 billion.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
WASHINGTON: The US government's budget deficit for fiscal year 2014 shrank to its lowest level in six years as tax revenues rose amid a growing economy, the Treasury Department said Wednesday.
The deficit stood at $483 billion in the year that ended September 30, a decline of 29 percent from the 2013 fiscal year shortfall of $680 billion.
It was the smallest deficit since 2008. The deficit fell below 3.0 percent of gross domestic product, or economic product, to 2.8 percent, a level last seen in 2007.
Last year's deficit-to-GDP ratio was "less than the average of the last 40 years," Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said at a news conference.
Revenues, mostly taxes, rose nine percent, while spending climbed only one percent.
Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and Shaun Donovan, head of the Office of Management and Budget, credited President Barack Obama's leadership in the budget process for driving down the country's deficit.
Referring to Obama's proposed fiscal year 2015 budget, they said in a statement that the new budget "continues this progress, bringing deficits down as a share of the economy to about two percent of GDP by the end of the next decade."

CCI
(A bench of Justice Vibhu…)
NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court today stayed an order of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) imposing a penalty of Rs one crore on US-based Google Inc for allegedly failing to provide information in a probe into its alleged unfair trade practices in India.
A bench of Justice Vibhu Bakhru also issued a notice to the CCI on the plea of the internet major and asked the panel to file its counter affidavit within four weeks.
The court also restrained the CCI from disclosing the confidential information related to the Google Inc.
"Prima facie, we are of the view that whatever information the petitioner (Google Inc) considers confidential shall not be disclosed," it said.
However, the court, for the time being, did not stay the ongoing probe against Google Inc.
The court's direction came on a plea moved by Google Inc which has alleged the CCI has "wrongly" imposed a fine of Rs one crore on it and it was not heard before the order was passed by the panel.
Google has also said the order was a "complete abuse" of authority by the CCI.
However, the CCI opposed the claim of the internet major that it was not heard saying the panel had accorded a "through" hearing.
During the hearing, the court said "it is true that this (CCI) order contains something which is not correct."
The case before the CCI relates to the allegations that Google Inc has been abusing its "dominant position" in the internet search engine space.
It was also alleged that Google Inc provides a number of vertical search services like YouTube, Google News, Google Maps etc and in order to promote its vertical search services, it mixes many of vertical results into organic search results.
The effect of such manipulation of results was that Google's vertical search partners will appear predominantly when an internet user searches for some information irrespective of whether the search results are most popular or relevant, said the allegations before the CCI.

Insurance brokers oppose 100% FDI proposalInsurance brokers oppose 100% FDI proposal
PTI Oct 15, 2014, 10.19PM IST
(The Suresh Mathur Committee…)
MUMBAI: The insurance broking industry is staunchly opposed to any move to gradually increase FDI in the intermediary segments to 100 per cent even as regulator IRDA is examining a top panel's recommendation in this regard.
An IRDA panel known as the Suresh Mathur Committee has recommended hiking FDI in all insurance sector intermediaries like brokers, surveyors, third-party administrators and web aggregators to 49 per cent, from the present 26 per cent immediately and then 100 per cent over the next three years.
According to industry sources, the panel headed by IRDA Joint Director Suresh Mathur had recently submitted its report.
"We will oppose the move to increase FDI cap to 100 per cent and we will do whatever we can do to resist that. We will approach the government on the issue once the report comes to us," Insurance Brokers' Association of India (IBAI) President Sohanlal Kadel told PTI.
Members of the IBAI collect close to Rs 20,000 crore premium per annum.
The Suresh Mathur Committee was formed in January 2014 on the basis of the report submitted by the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission (FSLRC), headed by retired judge N Srikrishna.
The Srikishna panel (FSLRC) was essentially formed to give a push to sluggish financial sector reforms, and it had recommended that wherever the government could raise FDI without parliamentary approval, it should do so without delay.
Observing that there ought to be a level-playing field between insurance companies and their brokers, Kadel, who himself was an IRDA panel member said, "We will welcome FDI up to 49 per cent from the existing 26 per cent, but we are not in favour of 100 per cent FDI in our segment."
"I was one of the members of the Suresh Mathur Committee, but I was not taken into confidence while writing the final report. In fact, it seems that the FSLRC was formed only for the purpose of recommending 100 per cent FDI in the insurance intermediaries segment," Kandel alleged.
He claimed that except for one or two of those in the 10-member panel, all other members were against 100 per cent FDI in the sector.
"Even if the report is out, it will first go to the Insurance Advisory Council for approval. I am a member of that council too and will register my protest at the council level too. In case it goes to the board, then we will approach the government in our bid to stop the move," he said.
Currently, there are 350 brokers in the country and one needs only Rs 50 lakh as capital investment to open an insurance broking firm in the country.
Out of these 350 brokers, there are only four broking firms namely Aon, Marsh, Jardine and Howden, which have foreign partners.
Earlier the England-based Willis was present in the country but lost its licence and is waiting to re-enter now.
There is only one foreign insurance surveyor called Cunningham Lindsey, which is present in the country at the moment.
Unlike the insurance industry, the insurance broking sector is a non-capital intensive one and hence there is no need to increase FDI to 100 per cent, said a broker with broking firm that has a joint venture with a foreign partner. He said that if higher foreign holding is allowed, it would put domestic players in trouble.
Hardly 20 per cent of the Rs 70,000-crore general insurance business is routed through brokers in the country, while in the USA, it is around 80 per cent, a prominent insurance broker said.

The road to Damascus passes through Ankaraprint
The Turkish parliament’s vote in favour of a cross-border military action is a force multiplier in Syria for the US and Nato. The Assad regime’s warning that it breaches Syrian sovereignty is unlikely to deter the West. Yet whether Turkey will acquiesce to becoming Nato’s cat’s paw is debatable.
That depends on the blowback it anticipates domestically from its diverse ethnic constituents, which include 15 million Kurds and about 10 million Alevis (akin to the Alawis of Syria), who have remained largely quiescent so far. Further deep-seated animosities against the Turk in the Arab world could tactically bring together contesting Arab Syrian opposition groups. 
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has outlined three objectives of the military action: Create a buffer zone within Syria to relieve pressure from unending refugees; topple the Assad regime; and support the peace process with the Turkish Kurds led by PKK’s Abdulla Ocalan. There are unstated goals too: Strengthen proxy Syrian Sunni opposition groups to prepare them for power and prevent ISIS from crossing into Turkey. It is a scenario pregnant with possibilities, all of which accord not surprisingly with American and Western priorities.
The Turkish exhortation to ease its difficulty of succouring two million refugees inside its territory and stemming the flow is reason enough for a military operation into Syria. Turkey has limited options unless ISIS stops its violence. UN Security Council resolutions on Syria already allow cross-border humanitarian aid without the regime’s sanction. The next step could well be a limited operation for establishing a safe haven inside Syria, possibly with a no-fly zone with support from Nato partners. It will be easy to sell it internationally. Turkey’s entry will effectively obliterate the border with Syria just as ISIS has succeeded in doing so with the Syria-Iraq border.
Nevertheless, if needed, a pretext for military action already exists: The security of the Turkish exclave in northern Syria and the mausoleum of Suleyman Shah, the grandfather of Osman I, the founder of the Ottoman dynasty. Erdogan has promised retaliation in case ISIS attacks the 40 Turkish soldiers guarding the shrine.
However, Turkish military operations against ISIS still remain a major problem. Quite apart from the flexibility in manoeuvre, tactics and weaponry that a non-State actor can muster, the duration of the engagement cannot be predicted. It will have to look forward to a long stay in the trenches without any guarantee of success. Turkey could well prefer to work through its armed Syrian proxies. Further, the costs of a frontal assault on ISIS could also prompt charges of killing co-religionists. At the same time a degree of intelligence coordination with the Assad regime appears indispensable for military success. Yet this remains outside the bounds of possibility.
Turkish entry is a mixed blessing for the Assad regime. Turkey is unlikely to take on the Syrian Army frontally, regardless of its relative superiority, lest it get charged with invasion. Rather, Turkey will aim to indirectly weaken and dissipate the Assad regime. It would put pressure by reducing the regime’s area of effective control including the major south-north communication arteries. By whittling down the regime’s support base it could provoke a renewed exodus towards the buffer zone. Much will depend on the extent to which Russia and Iran remain ready to shore up the Assad regime. Turkey’s military entry will exacerbate the political and religious churning in the region and a pliable Sunni-led government in Damascus seems the most probable outcome, which will anoint Turkey as the kingmaker in Syria.
This phase in the conflict will see the beginning of the re-drawing of borders in West Asia probably along confessional lines. Thanks to US support we could also see a larger Kurdish entity emerging beyond the autonomous region of Iraqi Kurdistan to include Kurds from Syria and Turkey and eventually Iran.

Exit polls predict BJP gains in Maharashtra  Haryana pollsComments
At least three exit polls put the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead but short of a clear majority in Maharashtra and Haryana on Wednesday, a ringing endorsement of the so-called 'Modi magic' that may have helped the party come into its own in the two politically crucial states.

A fourth survey by Today's Chanakya, which correctly predicted the results of the Lok Sabha polls this year, gave the party a clear majority in both states.
The projections, if true, could touch off a round of intense haggling between the party and its estranged allies - the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra and Haryana Janhit Congress (HJC) - for control of the two states that the Congress has led for more than a decade, either on its own or with its partners.
Read: Poll trends set off early Diwali for BJP
A BJP victory will reaffirm Modi's appeal among voters and silence detractors of his new party leadership, which was blamed for a string of defeats in recent by-elections that tempered the euphoria of his Lok Sabha triumph.
Modi campaigned extensively for the state elections, addressing 27 rallies in Maharashtra and 11 in Haryana in a bid to prop up the BJP's fortunes after the by-election losses.
A Times Now-C Voter poll predicted the BJP would bag 129 of 288 seats in the politically crucial state of Maharashtra despite the falling apart of its 25-year-old association with the Shiv Sena, which was projected to win in 56 constituencies. Times Now-C Voter predicted 37 seats for the BJP in the 90-member Haryana assembly.
An ABP-Nielsen poll predicted 144 seats for the BJP and 77 for the Sena, while an India Today-Cicero exit poll saw the BJP winning 124 seats in Maharashtra. The poll says the Shiv Sena will be the second largest gainer in Maharashtra with 71 seats.
The polls did not bring any cheer to the Congress party, already relegated to the political sidelines since its bruising defeat in the Lok Sabha polls.
The Times Now-C Voter poll said the Congress was likely to win 43 seats in Maharashtra while ABP-Nielsen said it will bag just 30 seats. In Haryana, Times Now-C Voter gave the Congress 15 seats and ABP-Nielsen poll predicted the country's main opposition party will get 10 seats.
Today's Chanakya predicted a clear majority of 151 seats for the BJP in Maharashtra and 52 in Haryana. Today's Chanakya was on the money when it predicted a 300-plus sweep for the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the Lok Sabha elections.
For the Congress, a poor result will possibly stoke further murmurs against Rahul Gandhi's leadership.
If the outcome on Sunday's judgement day matches the predictions, it would mean the Congress would have to carry forward with its restructuring process to script a turnaround in the face of a saffron surge.
Haryana saw a high turnout of 75.9%, while Maharashtra registered a turnout of  63.4% in the elections seen as a test of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popularity since he stormed to power in May and the BJP's strategy to abandon long-standing allies in the states.
The elections were mainly peaceful except for minor clashes between workers of the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), BJP and others in Haryana.
Analysts said the BJP had benefited from anger towards the Congress party, which has held power in Maharashtra for 15 years and Haryana for a decade. Both chief ministers, Prithviraj Chavan in Maharashtra and Bhupinder Hooda in Haryana, battled strong anti-incumbency with corruption being a major poll issue.
Read: Nearly 64% vote in Maharashtra, highest-ever 76% turnout in Haryana
The BJP took a big gamble on its popularity and campaigned alone in both states.
It was in contention for power for the first time in Haryana, where it was a junior partner in the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) government in 2000. Similarly in Maharashtra, the BJP had so far played second fiddle to the Shiv Sena, which led the coalition government in the state from 1995 to 1999. The Congress-NCP alliance ruled the state for 15 years from 1999.
In case of a hung verdict, the shaping up of new political alliances promises to be another interesting chapter following the high-stakes elections.

Fear grips the stock marketMarket 'freak out': Stocks rebound from scary plunge
By Matt Egan   @mattmegan5 October 15, 2014: 4:29 PM ET
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
Don't blink. Otherwise you're bound to miss a wild swing in this increasingly-violent stock market.
It was a memorable day on Wall Street as the Dow plummeted 460 points before staging a late rally to end down "only" 173 points. The Nasdaq briefly fell into correction territory, indicating a 10% drop from a prior high, but rebounded sharply to finish the day barely in the red.
"It was an emotion and panic-filled day both in and out of assets. You flushed out a lot of panicked longs and you're getting a knee-jerk bounce. What this means going forward, I don't know," said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group.
Late-day heroics: The factors behind the early losses were obvious and plentiful: slow economic growth, rising Ebola fears and continued uncertainty about the Federal Reserve. The reasons for the rebound were less clear, though beaten-down stock prices appeared to entice buyers to step off the sidelines.
Just look at the Nasdaq, which closed a whopping 2.4% above its low point for the day.
The Russell 2000, a basket of small-cap stocks that has recently taken a big hit, actually rallied over 1% Wednesday.
"$SPY $QQQ impressive comeback from the bottom," StockTwits user Zachi wrote.
Despite the late-day heroics, the recent slide on Wall Street has wiped out a whopping $1.5 trillion of market value from the S&P 500, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.
Fear continues to grip the stock market. This week CNNMoney's Fear & Greed Index has tumbled to zero, indicating "extreme fear," for the first time since 2011.
As investors flee risky assets like stocks, they are rushing into U.S. government bonds , which are seen as safe havens during times of market stress. The yield on the 10-year Treasury broke below 2% on Wednesday for the first time since mid-2013.
"We have a really toxic cocktail of negatives" that are "conspiring to put pressure on the markets," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities.
Related: Investors love U.S. bonds right now
The hardest hit stocks: The market has been jittery the past few weeks because Europe, especially Germany , isn't doing well. But now there is concern about the U.S.
Retail sales unexpectedly shrank last month for the first time since January, according to a government report this morning. Retailers like Macy's ( M ), Home Depot ( HD ) and J.C. Penney ( JCP ) dropped sharply on the news.
Also a new report showed inflation at the producer level dipped for the first time in over a year. Shrinking prices are not a sign of a healthy economy.
"People are truly frightened about the global growth picture," said John Canally, chief economist strategist at LPL Financial.
Related: Crashing oil prices could crush Vladimir Putin
American Airlines ( AAL ) and Delta Airlines ( DAL ) dropped early in the day as word spread that the new Ebola patient flew the day before being diagnosed. Other travel stocks like Carnival ( CCL ) cruise line and Hilton Worldwide ( HLT ) were also being hit as investors fear further fallout.
Close to a correction: Many market watchers believe a correction (a 10% decline from previous high) is long overdue. Such a downward move could even be healthy because it could lure in buyers who have been waiting on the sidelines for cheaper prices.
"Now is actually an attractive entry point for many investors," Merrill Lynch Wealth Management wrote in a note on Wednesday. "For investors who aren't used to the feel of turbulence, it's a reminder that this is the just fourth market pullback of 5% or more in two years (whereas the historical average is about three times a year)."
The S&P 500 hasn't suffered a correction since the one that ended in October 2011. To put that in perspective, Hollywood has had time to churn out three different Xmen movies over that span .
The S&P 500 needs to close below 1,810 to be in correction territory, based on its September 18 closing high of 2,011.36. It traded as low as 1,820 on Wednesday before ending at 1,862.
The Nasdaq slipped under 4,138 -- its correction level -- briefly today before rebounding to close at 4,215.
The Dow isn't far off from correction status either. It would need to dip below 15,552, compared with its close of 16,142.
All three major indexes remain far from bear market status. That more serious condition indicates a 20% decline from a previous high. Wall Street hasn't had a bear market since the financial crisis, though it came close during the last correction.

Maharashtra  Haryana state polls: Exit polls predict BJP win after record turnoutMaharashtra, Haryana state polls: Exit polls predict BJP win after record turnout
BS Reporter | New Delhi Oct 16, 2014 12:58 AM IST
Haryana and Maharashtra on Wednesday saw higher voter turnouts than those witnessed in these states either in the Lok Sabha polls earlier this year or the previous Assembly elections in 2009 - a traditional indication that people were voting for change. A similar indication came after the end of polling at 6 pm, when all the exit polls showed the incumbent governments in both states were unlikely to return to power.
Today's Chanakya, which had accurately predicted a huge victory for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Lok Sabha elections, saw the party again getting simple majority in both Haryana and Maharashtra. Other exit polls also forecast BJP would emerge as the single biggest party in both states but found the party falling short of the majority mark.
Chanakya showed BJP winning 52 seats in the 90-member Haryana Assembly, and 151 of the 288 seats in Maharashtra along with its smaller allies. The majority mark in these states is 46 and 145, respectively.
BJP leader J P Nadda told reporters after the polling that the party was confident of forming the government in both states.
 
The party believes the actual results on Sunday would vindicate its stand of going it alone - in Maharashtra, BJP had parted ways with the Shiv Sena, its ally of 25 years; in Haryana, it spilt with its Lok Sabha ally, Haryana Janhit Congress.

But other pollsters were more conservative about BJP's chances. ABP-Nielsen forecast 127 seats for the party in Maharashtra and 46 in Haryana. The exit polls of Times Now-CVoter and India TV-CVoter said BJP might bag around 130 seats in Maharashtra and 37 in Haryana. Congress was seen relegated to the third position in both states, by all polls. The Shiv Sena was predicted to be in the second in Maharashtra and the Indian National Lok Dal in Haryana.
The 73 per cent voter turnout in Haryana on Wednesday was marginally higher thn the 71.4 per cent seen in the Lok Sabha elections and the 72 per cent turnout during the previous Assembly election, in 2009.
In Maharashtra, the estimated 63 per cent turnout on Wednesday was close to the 62.36 per cent in the Lok Sabha elections and but much higher than the 59.5 per cent in the previous state election.
However, Maharashtra's Mumbai South constituency, where some of the wealthiest live, the turnout was not very encouraging. The 53.12 per cent voting in this constituency during the Lok Sabha polls had been a cause for celebration. In Wednesday's polling, though, the social media was agog with comments about voters' apathetic attitude, in spite of exhortations from Bollywood stars to vote. In this constituency, as also some other Mumbai suburbs, voters barely trickled in.
In the Lok Sabha polls, it was Bhandara Gondiya that had notched up one of the highest voting in Maharashtra (72 per cent). This time, it was Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan's seat, Karad South, that saw a turnout of 69 per cent, one of the highest.
In Haryana, the Congress seemed almost absent from polling booths, while the biggest presence of polling agents was for the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD); BJP, too, remained low-key. Some incidents of violence were reported from Hisar, where the Jat and Dalit communities clashed. Police and fire brigade had to be deployed in that area as some vehicles were burnt.

Putin puts a chill on German economyPutin puts a chill on German economy
By Mark Thompson   @MarkThompsonCNN October 14, 2014: 10:17 AM ET
Germany has blamed "geopolitics" such as the crisis with Russia over Ukraine for a sharp cut in its official growth forecasts.
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
It's official: Germany is hurting from the Ukraine crisis and mediocre global growth.
Europe's biggest economy sharply cut its forecasts for growth this year and next, citing "geopolitical crises" and the lackluster performance of its major trading partners.
The government said it expected gross domestic product to rise by 1.2% in 2014, compared with a forecast earlier this year of 1.8%. The rate of expansion for 2015 is just as dismal: 1.3%.
That's an even gloomier prognosis than the most recent outlook from the International Monetary Fund, which last week cuts its forecast for German GDP growth to 1.4% this year, and 1.5% next.
The biggest shock to the economy in the past six months has come from Russia, though a slowdown elsewhere in the world hasn't helped.
Related: 'Mediocre' growth plagues world economy
Germany is most exposed to the fallout of Western sanctions imposed over Russian meddling in Ukraine.
More than an actual loss of trade, the crisis has dented business confidence, prompting companies to put the brake on investments. The ZEW index of investor confidence has fallen for 10 months running, and in October hit its lowest level since late 2012.
A slump in factory activity and exports in August set alarm bells ringing about the health of Europe's economic stalwart.
Related: German stocks hit 1-year low on recession fears
Some of the drop came from the unusual timing of school holidays in the country.
All of these factors combined could lead Germany to report a recession in the third quarter, some analysts say. It would be the third recession since the financial crisis of 2008.
That in turn could mean another quarter of zero growth for the eurozone. Industrial production across the region was down 1.8% in August from July.
Germany is coming under growing pressure to loosen its purse strings and increase state spending on investment.
But other economists say that won't be necessary and Germany should rebound quickly, thanks to rising wages and very low levels of unemployment.

Toyota recalls another 1.75 million carsToyota recalls another 1.75 million cars
By Charles Riley   @CRrileyCNN October 15, 2014: 9:14 AM ET
Toyota's global recall includes 400,000 Lexus models sold in the United States.
HONG KONG (CNNMoney)
Toyota has issued three new recalls covering more than 1.75 million vehicles, the latest in a string of safety setbacks for the automaker.
The largest of the three recalls, which mostly covers vehicles sold in Japan, is needed to fix a problem in the brake systems of select Crown Majesta, Noah and Voxy models, the company said in an email. In some cases, brake performance could begin to gradually degrade if the problem is not fixed.
A second recall of 759,000 vehicles includes 423,000 Lexus models in the United States made between 2005 and 2010. The automaker is seeking to fix an issue with fuel delivery pipes that could increase the risk of a vehicle fire.
The third recall is restricted to 190,000 cars sold in Japan that may develop fuel leaks.
In all three cases, Toyota said it was not aware of any crashes, injuries, or fatalities that have resulted from the issues. Nearly two-thirds of the recalled vehicles were sold in Japan.
 
Meet a million-dollar Toyota
The new announcements will add substantially to Toyota's total recall number for the year. The company has already issued recalls over software problems and faulty airbags .
Earlier this year, Toyota agreed to pay a $1.2 billion fine -- the largest of its kind -- to settle a criminal probe into its conduct during its unintended acceleration recall of more than 10 million cars four years ago.
GM recalls reach 30 million for year
Auto recalls have captured the public's attention this year, especially in the U.S., where General Motors has come under fire for its handling of an ignition switch flaw tied to at least 23 deaths. GM has recalled more than 30 million vehicles so far in 2014.

Maharashtra  Haryana elections could unlock Modi`s reform pushTags: Maharashtra assembly polls ,  Assembly elections ,  Narendra Modi ,  Economic reforms ,  Modi`s government ,  India's economy
Pic Courtesy: -
Mumbai: Voters from Maharashtra and Haryana headed to the polls on Wednesday for the first major elections since Prime Minister Narendra Modi stormed to power five months ago, in a test of support that could unlock a round of delayed economic reform.
Opinion polls showed Modi`s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was likely to win in both states, unseating unpopular incumbents, but fall short of a majority in each.
State elections allot seats to the Rajya Sabha, or upper house of parliament, where the BJP and its allies do not have a majority. Although less powerful than the lower house (Lok Sabha), the body still plays a critical role in passing legislation and building the BJP`s seat tally there will help push through reform.
"Urging the people of Haryana & Maharashtra to go out & cast their votes. Youngsters must show the way & ensure record turnout," Modi posted on Twitter as polling stations opened.
Apparently with an eye on the elections, Modi`s government has put off unpopular decisions on raising the price of natural gas and ending a price cap on diesel. Both measures are expected to be implemented once the elections are out the way.
Modi`s caution has disappointed some investors who feel he has moved too slowly on reform despite winning the first parliamentary majority in more than 30 years on promises of reviving the economy and jobs.
After a weak showing for the BJP in a round of by-elections last month, Modi hit the stump hard in Maharashtra, home to financial hub Mumbai, and Haryana, where north Indian tech-city Gurgaon is located. The party has never been a major force in either state.
He has addressed dozens of rallies, railing against the Congress party incumbents in the states and trumpeting achievements such as attracting investment promises from Japan and opening bank accounts for the poor.
"Ever since he came to power, prices of vegetables etc. haven`t risen as much has they had earlier," said Suvidha Kamath, a housewife in central Mumbai. "We cannot judge Modi so soon. Let`s give him a couple of years to prove himself."
Results of the elections are due on Sunday.
BOLD REFORMS MAY BE AHEAD
Bagging two more state governments for his party would also make it easier for Modi to move ahead with a much-anticipated national goods and services tax to replace a labyrinth of levies that analysts say restrain the economy.
"Rather than delivering on big bang reforms, Modi`s approach as of now has been on repairing the economy through bridging the gaps which were existing," said Upasna Bhardwaj, an economist with ING Vysya Bank in Mumbai.
"We should definitely expect Modi`s government to have a bigger appetite for bold reforms if they were to acquire a strong hold in the upcoming two state elections."
Despite the relatively muted performance of Modi`s government so far, investors still view him positively, as reflected in Mumbai`s financial markets.
The Nifty has notched up a record-setting 25 percent gain so far this year, making it the best performer in Asia, and more than USD 30 billion in foreign investments has flowed into India markets so far in 2014.
Analysts expect Modi to tackle the government`s land acquisition policy to revive infrastructure investment and introduce a national goods and services tax by 2016, measures for which he will need to earn the support of state governments.
The BJP faces a series of elections over the next three years, starting with Jharkhand and Bihar next year and culminating in Uttar Pradesh, India`s most populous state, in 2017.

BENGALURU: In yet another case of hate crime against students from northeast, a Manipuri student in Bangalore was on Wednesday attacked by a gang of men for not knowing Kannada, Hindustan Times reports.
26-year-old T Michael Lamjathang Haokip was attacked in Kothanur, a part of the city that has high denisty of students from outstation.
 
Michael is the president of the Thadou (Manipuri tribe) Students' Association in Bangalore.
 
He is now reportedly out of danger.
The victim was quoted by Hindustan Times as saying, "They kept asking me to speak in Kannada. They said, 'If you outsiders know how to eat food that is produced in Karnataka, you must also know to speak Kannada. This is India not China.' I tried to reason with them but they were hysterical."
 
He added, "A friend from my community, Letmang Haokip, 35, was passing by on his motorbike at the same time. I jumped onto the bike and we started racing towards the police station. But mob followed us on their bikes and one of them crashed into us. We fell down and I started running for my life towards the police station. Just then a police patrol car arrived and the mob scattered."
Letmang, one of two friends of Michael who escaped with minor injuries, said he was robbed of his valuables and his bike documents.
Letmang said: "I was surrounded by the gang when Michael ran away. They snatched my valuables and my bike's documents. They would have probably killed me but Michael returned with the police."
According to Obed Haokip, one of Michael's friends, a local politician's aides helped the attackers escape.
 
The local police arrested three people and will launch an investigation into the case.
 
Earlier this year, the death of a Arunachal student Nido Taniam, brought to light the rise in hate crime against students from northeast.
 
Nido Taniam, son of Arunachal Pradesh Congress legislator Nido Pavitra, was allegedly beaten up mercilessly by shopkeepers on January 29 following a quarrel over his appearance and clothing. He died in a hospital the next day. (With inputs from agencies)

Apple Wants to Fight Supplier s Bankruptcy -- In SecretApple Asks Court’s Permission to Challenge GT Bankruptcy — In Secret
October 14, 2014, 4:09 PM PDT
By Dawn Chmielewski
Click to email this to a friend
Apple is seeking court permission to lodge its objections to GT Advanced Technologies’ bankruptcy filing in secret, to protect details of its confidential agreements with its would-be supplier of sapphire crystal.
The Cupertino technology giant filed a motion Tuesday asking to make its arguments under court seal to safeguard sensitive data, such as research and development details and other information related to its business process.
GT Advanced Technologies, which a year ago announced a high-profile deal to supply Apple with sapphire screens, abruptly filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Oct. 6. Shortly thereafter, the company asked the bankruptcy court’s permission to wind down its sapphire plants.
Many of the details surrounding the bankruptcy have been shrouded in secrecy because of confidentiality agreements between GT and Apple. The New Hampshire firm said it would be subject to a $50 million penalty per incident for disclosures that violate those agreements.
The state of New Hampshire filed an objection to the secrecy, noting that GT’s request to close sapphire manufacturing plants in Mesa, Ariz., and Salem, Mass., would leave 890 people out of work.
New Hampshire’s attorney general’s office argued in a motion that while the court should protect a company’s trade secrets, safeguarding all information pertaining about the business dealings between Apple and GT “goes much too far.”
The state said it remains unclear how a company that was assuring its investors of progress in August could have collapsed so suddenly into bankruptcy.
“The public interest in learning what transpired where [GT] made such confident statements publicly very recently, while clearly a catastrophic storm was on the horizon is very high,” wrote Peter C.L. Roth, senior assistant attorney general.

Insurance sector to get a faceliftInsurance sector to get a facelift
M Saraswathy | Mumbai Oct 15, 2014 11:15 PM IST
India’s insurance sector is set to get a facelift, with the insurance Bill likely to propose a host of changes. The Bill is scheduled to be tabled in the winter session of Parliament.
While the key amendment to the Insurance Act of 1938 is to increase the foreign direct investment (FDI) limit from 26 per cent to 49 per cent, it is likely to propose senior positions in insurance companies be held by Indians. It will also propose incentivising distributors to sell products.
The Bill was referred to a parliamentary select committee headed by the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Chandan Mitra, which has held talks with public and private insurers. It is expected the panel will give its final version of a scrutiny report on the Bill in four-five weeks.
Sources said insurers, both life and general, had made representations before the committee at a meeting on September 26.
Sources said the Bill proposed Indian management control of insurance companies. It is unclear whether the Indians will also account for the majority of the boards of these companies. Commission structures are also expected to be revised. As of now, the first-year commission stands at 15 per cent for five-year policies, with a fall in subsequent years.
Sources said the insurers were finding it difficult to retain agents. In the past three-four years, about 700,000 insurance agents had quit due to remuneration issues. Experts said the new Bill would have a more uniform commission structure. It is expected the Bill will propose seven-eight per cent commission for the first and second years; in subsequent years, the commission will be one-three per cent.
The new Bill will also emphasise health insurance. Insurers said health insurers and companies offering health products would have to bring this business under a separate section, headed by a senior team.
Sources said the parliamentary committee hadn’t taken a decision on allowing banks to act as insurance brokers. Currently, banks act as corporate agents; they can sell products of a life, a non-life and a standalone health insurer each.
It is likely the grievance-redressal mechanism will be focused on, with more stringent penalties for mis-selling. Insurance companies said penalties were already higher compared to five years ago.
A SEA CHANGE
CLAIMS REPUDIATION
Old: According to section 45 of the Insurance Act, 1938, no life insurance policy can be called into question on grounds of mis-statement or wrong disclosure after two years of the policy coming into force. However, if the insurer is able to prove the claim was fraudulent, it need not be passed
New: Section 45 in the new Bill says no claim can be repudiated after three years of the policy coming into force, even if a fraud is detected
FDI
Old: Foreign companies can hold up to 26% stake in an insurance company
New: Foreign companies can hold up to 49% stake in the company (FDI, FII and stake held by NRIs)
COMMISSION STRUCTURE FOR AGENTS
Old: Differed from year to year. First-year commission was the highest, but it fell in the second and third years
New: Standard commission might be allowed for first and second years to boost agent income and persistency
MANAGEMENT
Old: No mention of Indian management control
New: The new Bill mentions management control by Indians
ISSUING ELECTRONIC INSURANCE
Old: Talked little about technology
New: Will have detailed norms for electronic insurance and usage of technology in insurance

Make prostitution legal to curb rapes  says seer'Make prostitution legal to curb rapes'
Woman seer in Karnataka flays girls who wear skimpy clothes.
By Aravind Gowda | Mail Today –  Wed 15 Oct, 2014

BENGALURU: A PROMINENT religious head of Lingayats — Karnataka’s largest community — has kicked up a storm by saying that “provocative dressing sense of women” has led to a steep rise in rapes across the country.
Mathe Mahadevi, the lone woman ‘Jagadguru’ of Lingayats, also urged the government to legalise prostitution to curb the menace.
As soon as the seer said girls should not wear “revealing clothes”, progressive and non-governmental organisations in Karnataka voiced their angst against the religious leader for making the controversial remark.
Mahadevi is the ‘Peetha Adhyakshe’ (a pontiff) of the revered Basava Dharma Peetha in Koodala Sangama — the holiest pilgrimage centre for Lingayats — in North Karnataka.
“As long as women continue to wear revealing clothes, rapes will happen. Women, especially girls, should give up western clothes and wear costumes that reflect their culture and tradition. I see a strong vacuum of cultural values among the young generation,” she said in the northern Karnataka town of Dharwad.
Mahadevi said women, by wearing skimpy clothes, were inviting unwanted attention and danger by doing so and were becoming soft targets of perverts and sex criminals.
Though she did not directly attribute it to the liberalisation of economy, Mahadevi — one of the strong proponents of local culture — remarked, “I am appalled with the deterioration of the health of society. We cannot have a quick fix formula, only long-term solutions will work.” Without referring to any particular case, she noted that some women misuse the laws framed for their protection and indulge in blackmailing.
When the reporters asked her about the sexual harassment charge levelled against the pontiff of the Sri Ramachandrapura Math Raghaveshwara Bharati Swami by renowned singer Premalatha Divakar, the seer was quick to demand a probe. “If the probe reveals that there is truth in the singer’s allegation, I will extend moral support to her,” she said.
The woman seer also urged the Karnataka government to legalise prostitution. “I am not the first person to suggest legalisation of prostitution. This has been the demand of several sections of the society. Unless we legalise prostitution, rapes and sexual harassment of women cannot be stopped. Legalising prostitution is the best deterrent to rapes,” she contended.
Mahadevi also demanded that the government set up a special committee to examine her suggestions.
“Ideally, the government should look into the aspects to solve the problems faced by the society. We need long-term measures to tackle these social evils,” she said.
The seer remarks sparked protests from several cities and towns across Karnataka. Student organisations condemned her for blaming their dressing sense.

Lex Live: Workin on the railroadReddit
Railroads, the industry that arguably contributed the most to United States prosperity in the 19th century, aren’t that glamorous anymore. However this week the industry is back in the news in a big way. CSX, one of seven big “ Class I ” railroads with operations in the US, is the potential acquisition target of Canadian Pacific, a top-tier rival. Both have equity values exceeding $30bn. A combination would create an unprecedented transcontinental railroad. CSX’s tracks are in the eastern United States, while CP’s lines are in the west and upper Midwest.
Commercial railroads are privately held in the US. ( The passenger service, Amtrak , is however owned by the government.) The industry is textbook example of a “ natural” monopoly , with no more than two operators in any given region. Capital costs are high so it makes sense to organise the industry around a few titans with the scale to afford necessary investments.
Those investments are massive indeed. The seven Class I railroads last year spent $15bn on capital improvements to repair and improve tracks and buy new cars. That amount represented a whopping 17 per cent of revenue, when half that ratio would be considered high in most of corporate America.
That capital investment required suggests returns on investment capital won’t be towering. (ROIC is defined as after-tax EBIT/ (total debt + shareholders equity)).
With weighted average costs of capital (WACC) typically around 10 per cent, most ROICs are right around that figure among railroads. And that is only after many have improved operations and taken advantage of a US economic recovery.
Even if percentage returns aren’t exemplary, the benefit of having big capital bases is that small improvements have a big impact in absolute dollar terms. Consider the formula for “ economic value added ”: (ROIC- WACC) * capital base. At CSX, an increase in ROIC of 200 basis points is worth $400m annually, based on total capital of $20bn.
The risk in a merger is that the premium paid exceeds any combination benefits for the acquirer. So watch whether Canadian Pacific remains disciplined in a potential bidding war.

Ebola is spooking Wall StreetEbola is spooking Wall Street
By Matt Egan   @mattmegan5 October 15, 2014: 12:11 PM ET
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
The Ebola epidemic is starting to contaminate sentiment on Wall Street, which is already losing sleep over countless crises.
The arrival of Ebola in the U.S. has coincided with a period of extreme turbulence in the stock market, which has tumbled about 8% from record highs.
The deadly virus is clearly not the only factor behind the market slide, but it's a major unknown that is increasingly weighing on market psychology. That was the case again on Wednesday as the Dow plummeted as much as 370 points and health officials revealed a second health-care worker in Dallas tested positive for Ebola .
Ebola fears are most obvious in the airline sector. Shares of American Airlines Group ( AAL ) and Delta Air Lines ( DAL ) fell sharply on Wednesday, hurt by the news that the new Ebola patient flew the day before being diagnosed . Both airlines are down nearly 20% over the past month alone.
"The fear is that people will be afraid to fly," said Jason Weisberg, managing director at Seaport Securities.
Other sectors being caught in the Ebola downdraft include the cruise industry, where Royal Caribbean Cruises ( RCL ) and Carnival ( CCL ) have tumbled nearly 20% from their 52-week highs.
Hotel stocks like Hilton Worldwide ( HLT ) and Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide ( HOT ) have also been punished by the Ebola concerns.
Related: Stocks should fall more. You shouldn't worry
Extreme fear: The Ebola scare is not having an impact on many businesses at this point. For that to happen, the deadly virus would have to spread much more rapidly in the West. That means earnings -- the fundamental component of stock prices -- aren't being hit.
However, market psychology, which has become increasingly fragile, is clearly being hurt by the Ebola epidemic.
"The stock market is now driven by emotion rather than fundamentals. The former rapidly switches from greed to fear on Ebola news," Ed Yardeni, president of investment advisory Yardeni Research, wrote in a note on Wednesday.
Just check out CNNMoney's Fear & Greed Index . It tumbled to zero for the second time ever earlier this week , indicating "extreme fear." Just a few months ago it was flashing "extreme greed" as stocks cruised to record highs.
The VIX gauge of market volatility has spiked 90% over just the past month alone as wild market swings have become the norm.
Related: Crashing oil prices could crush Vladimir Putin
To be sure, Ebola is not the main driver of the current market pullback. There have been plenty of other negative headlines to go along with Ebola, including Europe's gloomy economy , the energy price meltdown , new gains by ISIS in Iraq and worries that global central bankers are out of ammo.
It's all "added up to a nasty, snowballing environment of shoulder tapping and second guessing that continues to keep rallies under lock and key," Michael Block, chief market strategist at Rhino Trading, wrote in a note on Wednesday.
A number of investors believe Monday's late-day nosedive was caused by a false alarm about passengers with flu-like symptoms being removed from a flight in Boston.

Greed isn't dead: Wall Street never misses a chance to make money. Investors are betting that at least some companies will be able to capitalize on the epidemic.
However, it's important to remember these stocks have very small market valuations, making them potentially risky and speculative plays, especially for retail investors.
Shares of Tekmira Pharmaceuticals ( TKMR ), which is working on an experimental Ebola drug , have soared 200% this year.
Another bright spot has been Lakeland Industries ( LAKE ). The Hazmat suit maker has skyrocketed almost 300% over just the last three months alone even though it remains a risky bet.
While fear continues to dominate Wall Street, some believe the recent chaos has given investors sitting on the sidelines a chance to jump into the stock market. That could explain why the Dow erased more than half of its early 370-point plunge on Wednesday.
"We're seeing stocks at some levels that are very, very attractive. Unless you think the world is going to suffer a complete meltdown here, this is a very good buying opportunity," said Weisberg.

U.S. bond limbo: How low can rates goBy Paul R. La Monica   @lamonicabuzz October 17, 2014: 10:49 AM ET
 
Will bond yields fall lower?
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
Investors are running away from stocks as fast as they can.
The Dow plunged more than 350 points shortly after the opening bell Wednesday while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq each dropped more than 2%.
Stocks rebounded later in the morning but the sell-off worsened as the day wore on. The Dow was down more than 400 points by mid-afternoon.
Strangely enough though, it seems that investors are still bullish on America in spite of the market volatility. They are doubling down their bets on U.S. Treasury bonds.
The rate on a 10 Year Treasury plunged Wednesday morning to 1.86% -- its lowest level since May 2013. Yields fall when investors are buying bonds.
The yield moved back above 2% later on during the day. So rates still have a relatively long way to go before they approach their all-time low of 1.39% from July 2012.
Bond investors do the safety dance. So why the heck is everybody rushing into bonds?
One word: Security. The United States still seems to be holding up better than Europe and Japan. Concerns about China's economy losing steam are also making the U.S. look more attractive.
Related: The stock market scare: 3 key numbers to watch
And with worries about Ebola and ISIS roiling the stock market, traders need someplace to put their money -- besides burying it in the backyard or sticking it under a mattress.
"Lower rates are not a result of fears about the U.S. economy," said Michael Arone, a chief investment strategist for State Street Global Advisors. "This is a flight to safety. Investors had been much too complacent until recently."
The big drop in rates is a bit curious though given that the Federal Reserve is about to end its long-running bond purchase program, a policy known as quantitative easing or QE.
At the beginning of the year, many experts thought that the 10 Year Treasury could finish 2014 with a yield of more than 3%. Some thought 4% wasn't even out of the question once QE was over.
What appears to be happening is that foreign investors are still buying massive amounts of U.S. debt. China and Japan each hold more than $1 trillion in U.S. Treasuries.
Could rates fall even further from here? Yes.
But the bottom would probably have to fall out of the U.S. economy for Treasuries to hit a new record low.
Low rates aren't always a good sign. Keep in mind that while rates are extremely low in the U.S., they are even lower in other developed markets. France's 10 Year yields just 1.2%. Germany's 10 Year is yielding 0.84%. Japan's benchmark is below 0.5%. This is not because investors love the economic conditions in Europe and Japan. It's the opposite. Investors are worried about deflation.
So if you believe the U.S. economy is not heading into a recession, rates should head higher. A general rule of thumb is that higher rates go along with stronger economies.
"Bonds are a place where people are trying to hide today. Investors have been chased into them," said Keith Trauner, co-manager of the GoodHaven mutual fund (GOODX). "Even if there is more fear in the world in the short-term, betting on lower rates for a sustained period of time is likely to be a bad move."
 
Markets go for a wild ride
Trauner said that investors may be duping themselves into thinking that bonds are a safe, stable bet. He said rates should head higher once the recent market turmoil is over and used a popular joke on Wall Street to describe the high-risk and low-reward nature of bonds.
"It's like picking up pennies in front of a steamroller," he said.
Still, people have been declaring the end of the bond bull market all year. And they've been consistently wrong.
"U.S. Treasuries have been the number one asset to own this year by a long shot," said Paul Karos, senior portfolio manager for Whitebox Mutual Funds. "Who would have thought government bonds would outperform stocks by this much?"
Good news for consumers? But regardless of whether or not bonds are still a good investment right now, consumers may benefit from the continued decline in long-term rates.
For anyone lucky enough to be able to get approval for a loan, you can expect mortgage rates to keep falling along with the 10 Year.
Bob Baur, chief global economist for Principal Global Investors, said it's possible that the combination of cheaper credit and lower oil and gas prices that are another byproduct of the global market turmoil may help fuel the economy in the fourth quarter.
"The U.S. economy is still in good shape. The drop in mortgage rates is very positive," Baur said. "There could be a little boom-let here. The decline in stocks does not look like a harbinger of recession right now."
Related: German economy hurt by Russia-Ukraine crisis
But will that still be the case if stocks and bond yields keep falling? Arone conceded that at some point, investors may view the drop in U.S. bond yields as a sign of global economic malaise partially caused by the strong dollar. The dollar's rally has made it tougher for European consumers to afford American-made goods.
So a tipping point may soon be reached. Low U.S. bond rates will be something to fear instead of cheer.
"U.S. economic data has been strong lately. Housing, auto sales and manufacturing are all solid," Karos said. "But can it last?" The rest of the world needs to turn around or the U.S. will drift lower."

Doosra can be bowled legally: HarbhajanTweet
0
Harbhajan Singh has slammed former ICC umpire Darrell Hair, who had labelled the 34-year old Indian off-spinner, Sri Lankan legend Muthiah Muralitharan and former Pakistan spinner Saqlain Mushtaq as 'role models' for 'chuckers'.
Kicking around: Harbhajan Singh“This is too much. We didn't cross the limit but now Hair is 'crossing the limit'. He seems to have gone mad," the discarded off-spinner said.
"We were always within the permissible limit. Muralitharan and I were cleared by the ICC more than once and why didn't Hair object to my bowling thereafter? Was it because he was feared of losing his job as an ICC umpire? We are not sons-in-law of the ICC,"  he went on to add.
Harbhajan was reported for a suspect action on two occasions in 1999 and 2005 but was cleared both times after undergoing tests in Perth, Australia. He also said that the doosra can be bowled legally without bending the arm beyond the 15 degree limit.
DOOSRA CAN BE BOWLED LEGALLY
"The present day bowlers are trying to bowl the doosra, which was invented by us. It doesn't necessarily mean they are bending arms more than the limit. The doosra can be bowled without bending the arms too much,” Harbhajan said.
"The ICC has set a standard for his bowlers and using the latest technology. Hair should stop challenging the technology and better keep his mouth shut." the off spinner added.
There are rumours about Hair being given an advisory role before the World Cup next year. It remains to be seen whether the ICC is willing to take such a step or not.

Sugarcane and Janaki AmmalUpdated: October 15, 2014 22:44 IST

TOPICS
agricultural research and technology
The Indian National Science Academy (INSA) arranged a seminar last week on the history of science in India, with particular focus on the last 100 years. Among the various topics, work in the area of genetics during the early years of the 20 century was presented by Dr. Durgadas Kasbekar of the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, Hyderabad. In a gripping and highly informative half an hour, he presented three advances made in India, namely the success story of sugarcane breeding, the discovery of the Bombay Blood Type (the “O” subgroup) and the mathematical analysis of the mapping of genes distributed across the length of the chromosome. Of these, the story of sugarcane breeding and generating new varieties was particularly gripping not only for its glorious success but also because it highlighted the dedicated work of a lady scientist named Edavaleth Kakkat Janaki Ammal. And this story is worth retelling.
Dr. K.T. Achaya has written in his authoritative book, “Indian Food: A Historical Companion” (OUP 1994) that while sugarcane was well known and grown in India since the Rigvedic times (c. 1500 BC), as Ikshu, and Kautilya (c. 300 BC) mentions a whole range of products from sugarcane, our canes were not as sweet as those from the Far East. They had however robust stalks. Achaya in his other book: “A historical dictionary of Indian food” (OUP 1998) states that the Tamil book Agananuru mentions that when carts got stuck in the mud, stalks of sugarcane were heaped beneath the wheel to provide a grip! Such has been the robustness of our sugarcane.
The sweetest sugarcane comes from Papua New Guinea, and termed Saccharum officianarum. Also called ‘noble’ cane, it migrated northwest to Asia. During the early 1900s, India actually imported this sweet sugar from Java and the Far East. The freedom fighter and scholar Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya had suggested in the 1910s that we in India should do botanical work to sweeten our own varieties (called S. spontaneum). This led to the start of the Sugarcane Breeding Station at Coimbatore, Madras Presidency, led by C. A. Barber, which took on the task of improving the Indian sugarcane plants. He and his assistant T.S. Venkataraman began crossing the ‘noble’ S. Officianarum females with S. Spontaneum males.
As Kasbekar explains, when the pollen of spontaneum fertilized eggs of officianarum, the products retained the full chromosome complement of officianarum, generating a hybrid sugarcane plant as sweet as officianarum and with robust stalks as in spontaneum. Back-crossing of the hybrid male with officianarum was even more successful. Success was thus achieved in producing sweeter varieties of Indian sugarcane. These Coimbatore breeds (Co-canes) were so successful that in the first year itself they increased sugarcane production in Punjab by 50 per cent, and were even exported to places like Cuba. Between 1930 and 1935, this work of Venkataraman led to a doubling of sugarcane production in the country.
It was during this time that the young girl from Tellichery, Kerala, Janaki Ammal (b. Nov 4, 1897) movedto do her BSc and BSc Honours from Queen Mary’s and Presidency Colleges, Madras. With a scholarship, she moved to the University of Michigan, U.S. to get her MS in 1925. She came back, got her DSc in 1931 and joined the Sugarcane Breeding Station at Coimbatore to work with Venkataraman on sugarcane biology. She was an expert in cytogenetics (the genetic content and expression of genes in the cell). She had known that plants display polyploidy (collection of not just two pairs of chromosomes in each cell, as our body cells do, but many multiples of 2, e.g., 2n = 48, 56, 64, 72 and even 112). Her research in this area led to our understanding of the nature of polyploidy in sugarcane, forming a firm scientific basis for crossing and hybrids, but also helped in choosing plant varieties for cross-breeding. It also helped analyse the geographical distribution of sugarcane across India, and to establish that S. Spontaneum is sugarcane that originated in India.
She left Coimbatore to join the John Innes Institute at London and then the Royal Horticulture Society at Wisley, during the years 1945-51. A summary of the life and times of Janaki Ammal has been written by the famous scholar in plant pathology and evolution, Professor Chiryathumadom Venkatachalier Subramanian of Chennai (www.ias.ac.in/womenin science/Janaki.pdf). He writes that Nehru invited Janaki Ammal to return and reorganize the Botanical Survey of India. She came back and ran the Botanical Survey of India.
Even earlier than Nehru, Professor C.V. Raman saw the spark in her and made her a Foundation Fellow of the Academy. Years later, in 1957, she was elected to INSA — the first woman scientist elected to any of the science academies in India. She was also awarded the Padma Shri in 1957. Having led a full life, she breathed her last on February 4, 1984. Think about it; every time you bite a sugarcane, or a lump of gud or vellam, you are enjoying the fruits of toil of Barber, Venkataraman and Janaki.

Time for a wakeup call at Pizza HutTime for a wakeup call at Pizza Hut?
By Melvin Backman   @CNNMoney October 15, 2014: 6:21 PM ET
Domino's is gaining on Pizza Hut in the race for market dominance.
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
Cheesy bacon crusts might not be enough to get Pizza Hut out of its recent slump.
Sales at the biggest American pizza chain have been slowing down in recent quarters, and its rivals are chomping at the bit.
"Pizza Hut's been seemingly asleep," said David Palmer, an analyst who watches Yum Brands ( YUM ) for Royal Bank of Canada. But instead of waking up, analysts fear that the company is pushing the snooze button.

It's still the biggest pizza player, with 16.7% of the U.S. market in 2013, according to industry research firm Technomic. But that's a dip from the year before, and the next three largest chains — Domino's ( DPZ ), Little Caesars and Papa John's ( PZZA ), respectively — all increased their footholds in the industry during that time.
Domino's made the biggest jump, raising its market share to 11.1% from 10.5% in that time, Technomic said. As Pizza Hut's biggest rival, it has done a lot of things right that Pizza Hut has said it wants to do. A few years back, Domino's revamped its menu and made a big push to boost digital and online ordering.
Its efforts paid off, and Domino's isn't slowing down in eating up market share. It reported Tuesday that sales at existing U.S. stores were up nearly 8% from a year ago. Yum said last week that similar sales at Pizza Huts outside China and India are down 1%, and that's an improvement.
Yum CEO David Novak, during the fast food giant's most recent earnings call, said the company is tinkering with things at Pizza Hut. He said the new Hershey cookie cake and cheesy-bacon stuffed crust pizzas were doing well, and he pointed to a noticeable boost in online and mobile orders.

Yum first acknowledged Pizza Hut's struggles earlier this year, when it began lowering expectations for the division. One analyst went so far as to suggest that Yum sell Pizza Hut off .
Another way forward might be an upscale Chipotle ( CMG )-style pizza restaurant clone that could serve as a test lab for new pizza ideas.
Yum already did that for Taco Bell with U.S. Taco Co. and KFC has southern-fried Super Chix. But a Yum spokesman said no such pizza stores are forthcoming, even though Chipotle has reportedly been partnering to develop a pizza place of its own .
 
Cooking up pizza to last for 3 years
Yum is also underperforming in the stock market, though that has more to do with a lingering food scandal in China than Pizza Hut's slump. Its shares were down 11% for the year on Tuesday. Domino's stock is up 20%, though Papa John's has fallen more than 5.5%.

Ebola impact: Airline stocks slideAirline stocks continue to tumble

Shares of major U.S. airlines tumbled in mid-day trading Wednesday.
Airline stocks remained volatile Wednesday in the midst of growing concerns about the Ebola virus, and economic uncertainty overseas. The New York Stock Exchange’s ARCA airline index, which has fallen close to 20% since early September, was off 2.46% in mid-day trading.
Among the major network carriers at mid-day, United Continental Holdings took the biggest plunge, down 6.25% to $40.47. American Airlines Group dropped 4.54% to $30.08, and Delta, which is releasing its third quarter earnings report Thursday, dropped 4.97% to $31.16.
Analysts expect third quarter earnings to be strong across the industry, and several carriers saw record profits in the previous quarter. Falling oil prices mean substantial savings on fuel and potentially higher profits for the airlines. But fears about the spread of the deadly Ebola virus, as well as stalling economies in Europe and Asia, are making investors nervous.

Butch Dill / AP fileThe time is almost here for many new grads to start paying back their student loans. For those who graduated in May, the six-month grace period offered on most federal loans is about to expire.
Worried you can’t afford it? You’re not alone.
The average Class of 2014 graduate who has student loan debt has to pay back about $30,000. Yet many recent grads are finding it difficult to find a job or are working in low-paying positions.
“The real problem when borrowers get out of school is that their income is probably the lowest it’s going to be throughout their lifetime and also their debt is the highest it’s going to be throughout their lifetime,” says Andy Josuweit, the CEO of Student Loan Hero , a website that helps borrowers keep track of loans and suggests repayment options.
Nightly Business Report: How to avoid student loan default
So many borrowers pay late or miss payments. The consequences of going into default — failure to make a loan payment for 270 days or more — are severe. “When a borrower defaults they essentially get 16 to 25 percent of collection costs tacked on to their student loan principal,” Josuweit says.
The key to avoid default is to contact your loan servicer or lender and find out your options. Here are some repayment strategies that may make paying back your loans less painful.
Income-driven repayment plans
Unemployed or underemployed borrowers may be eligible for a variety of income-driven repayment plans to pay back their federal student loans. While the standard plan caps the repayment period at 10 years, these plans let you pay back what you owe over 20 to 25 years – and if you haven’t paid off the entire balance by then, the loan may be forgiven. Also, your loan repayment may be capped at 10 to 15 percent of your discretionary income, depending on the plan. Compared to the standard plan, borrowers may pay more in interest over the life of the loan. But it’s a far better option that default. You can find out more information about income-driven repayment plans at studentaid.gov.
Deferment or forebearance
Under certain circumstances, you may be eligible for deferment or forbearance, allowing you to temporarily postpone or reduce your federal student loan payments. During deferment, the repayment of principal and interest on your loan is delayed. You’ll need to request this option from your loan servicer. If you can’t make your loan payments but don’t qualify for deferment, then you may be able to receive forbearance. With forbearance, you may be able to stop making payments or reduce your monthly payment for up to 12 months at a time, though interest will continue to accrue.
Video: According to recent data, just over half of student loan borrowers are making payments. Eric Best, Jacksonville State University, and CNBC's Sharon Epperson, discuss what can be done to stop the crisis.
Refinance private loans
Borrowers with private student loans have fewer options, but can request to extend the term or lower the interest rate to reduce their monthly payments. “Some private financial institutions are willing to lower your interest rate between 3 to 5 percent depending if you do a variable or fixed rate student loan and it could really lower monthly payments and total interest that borrower is going to accrue over the lifetime,” Josuweit says.
Talking to your loan servicer or financial institution to review your options can not only ease your financial strain, it can help you avoid the devastating financial blow of default.
“Ninety percent of the time when we can reach a customer and tell them about their options we can help them avoid default,” says Patricia Christel of Navient, formerly part of Sallie Mae, one of the four major loan servicers for federal student loans. “Of those who do default – 90 percent of the time — we haven’t been able to reach them. So answer the phone to find out about your options.”

The Self-Driving Tesla Might Make Us Love Urban Sprawl AgainIrony: When the car of the future might rekindle old problems.
Photo by David Becker/Getty Images
This article originally appeared in Wired .
Elon Musk announced last week that the Model S will feature “autopilot,” an ability to take over for the driver in limited situations. The move closes a gap between Tesla and more established automakers, which have provided increasing levels of autonomous tech . It will net the young company quite a windfall and make driving safer and easier for its customers. It’s a significant step toward a future where cars drive themselves, and doing so with electricity offers an enticing view of a future where cars are awesome and the atmosphere is squeaky clean.

Unless the new Tesla and other autonomous vehicles end up doing more harm than good to the planet.
As driving becomes less onerous and computer-controlled systems reduce traffic, some experts worry that will eliminate a powerful incentive—commuting sucks—for living near cities, where urban density makes for more efficient sharing of resources. In other words, autonomous vehicles could lead to urban sprawl.
It’s simple, says Ken Laberteaux, a senior scientist at Toyota. If you make transportation faster, easier and perhaps cheaper, then people won’t mind commuting. “What a consumer is expected to do is see what they can gain by moving a little further from the job centers or the cultural centers,” he says. That’s bad news: Urban sprawl is linked to economic, environmental, and health hardships.
Proponents of autonomous cars predict that once humans are no longer responsible for driving, we’ll see a decrease in crashes, a reduction in congestion and a spike in ride sharing. The current model, in which people own or lease a car, could fundamentally change to a subscription model in which people simply summon a car when they need one, and it appears, all by itself. Laberteaux says such a shift is possible, but won’t happen for a long time.
Self-driving cars might one day lead to a decrease in personal car ownership, and an increase in walking-oriented lifestyles. But first, we’ve got to live through the phase of semi-autonomous driving. Those cars will likely need human intervention at least some of the time, so they won’t change the current ownership model. They will, however, make driving way more convenient, incentivizing long commutes.
Laberteaux’s not the only one concerned about this. Autonomous vehicles should ease highway congestion, and commuters will be able to catch up on work or sleep en route to the office. That limits the incentive to trade your McMansion for a brownstone, says Reid Ewing, director of the University of Utah’s Metropolitan Research Center. The implications of this go beyond transportation; in a 2014 report for advocacy group Smart Growth America , Ewing linked sprawl to obesity and economic immobility.
Ewing likens autonomous driving to the construction of “superhighways” during the post-war boom years, which spurred suburbanization. “If you can travel at higher speeds with less congestion and you can use your time productively while you’re traveling in a self-driving car, the generalized cost of travel will be less on a vehicle-per-mile basis,” says Ewing. “Just like when, before the interstate system, people were traveling at 30 miles per hour, there wasn’t nearly the spread of development that there is today.”
What’s interesting is that the potential for increased suburbanization comes as many American metropolitan area are seeing a reduction in sprawl , in large part through a city-loving “Echo Boomer” generation coming into the workforce. According to a report Rutgers University published last month , population growth in New York City since 2010 has surpassed its suburban communities for the first time since World War II.
So how can urban planners ensure that trend toward urbanization doesn’t reverse again? Use traditional tools like zoning, pricing, and urban design, says Ratna Amin, director of transportation policy at the Bay Area planning nonprofit SPUR. “Transit sprawl and autonomous vehicle sprawl, these things happen in the absence of growth management,” says Amin. “We can put boundaries on sprawl.”
SPUR, like like-minded organizations, advocates for subsidized share car parking, competitive pricing for suburban parking, to make driving less appealing. The implementation of high-speed bus systems makes it easier to get around with a personal vehicle. The risk of autonomous-induced sprawl, Amin argues, makes priorities like these more important. The conversation has just begun, she says, but it’s crucial that these things are worked out before, and not after, the self-driving cars show up.

Guidelines to set up small finance banks soon: RajanGuidelines to set up small finance banks soon: Rajan
BS Reporter | Hyderabad Oct 15, 2014 11:14 PM IST
The guidelines for setting up small finance banks catering to small customers would be issued in a few weeks, Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan said here on Wednesday.
Small finance banks have been proposed keeping in mind the goal to achieve financial inclusion through a variety of banking institution models.
Rajan was here to deliver a keynote address on technology usage in banking at awards function organised by the Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology.
He also exhorted the existing banks to buttress their financial inclusion efforts by optimally using technology such as tying up with mobile phone service providers to offer banking services on mobile platforms, so that banking services become accessible and affordable to millions of Indians.
“We have tried very hard to get banks co-operate with mobile companies. But the transactions are still very low,” he said, while stating that communication and mobile technologies should be an important part of growth and expansion of services.
Rajan noted the regulator had released guidelines on mobile banking and that the impact of new forms of competition should not be underestimated. “That is why we have progressed on putting out guidelines for payment banks... to allow mobile companies and perhaps some software companies and perhaps some retail houses to enter into the business of payment banking,” he said.
To sustain business, these  payment banks should have back-end tie-ups with the regular commercial banks, working as banking correspondents for them. “To my mind, a viable model would be a payment bank which essentially allows the access throughout the country, but at the bank’s end (it should have) a tie-up with a regular commercial bank so that it can offer services over and beyond the payment bank,” Rajan said. He added that these will encourage more alliances in the banking services field.
He said similar steps should be initiated for small- and medium-size firms as they, too, have similar issues of accessing finance. “We are trying to progress on trade receivable finance where small- and medium-size enterprises that have receivables against large enterprises can actually in an automated fashion have those receivables put up for auction bought by various people with surplus cash — financial institutions or banks — at a discount, such that those buyers get an interest for the loans and small business can get money quickly so they can go out and invest more in the business and grow.”

Google unveils Android LollipopGoogle unveils Android Lollipop and latest Nexus devices
By James O'Toole   @jtotoole October 15, 2014: 3:28 PM ET
 
Check out Google's new Android L
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
The latest version of Android is almost here.
Google ( GOOGL , Tech30 ) announced Wednesday that the new version of its Android mobile operating system, nicknamed "Lollipop," will be available on select mobile devices within the next few weeks.
Lollipop will first be available on the Nexus 6, a new phone developed with Motorola that hits stores in November. It will also be available on the new Nexus 9 tablet from HTC and the Nexus Player, a gaming and streaming media device from Asus.
The software will follow shortly on other Nexus-branded devices, as well as a handful of "Google Play edition" phones. Those phones, from companies like Samsung and HTC, run Google's pure version of Android without any of the typical bells and whistles that phone makers add to make their phones stand out against their rivals.
Google previewed Lollipop at its software developer conference earlier this year.
The software is designed to work across all your devices, from smartphones to tablets to TVs, storing your information and allowing you to pick up wherever you left off on a previous screen -- even if it was on a different gadget. It allows for multiple user accounts on a single device, as well as custom notifications for specific contacts.
Lollipop also has a cleaned-up look that Google calls "material design," which gives the illusion of varying depths of perspective for images on the screen. It also allows users to set up a "personal unlocking" system in which the phone won't require a passcode when it senses that it's in a trusted location or detects your Bluetooth-enabled wearable devices.
There's no word yet on when Lollipop will be available for the wider world of Android devices, but expect it to be available in the coming months as hardware makers incorporate it into their designs.

The Nexus gadgets aren't usually big sellers, but they're popular among Android enthusiasts who like to tinker with their devices and don't want to deal with software skins from phone manufacturers.
For Google, the Nexus line is a chance to display what it sees as the ideal hardware complements for Android and set an example for manufacturers.
The Nexus 6 phone comes with a massive 6-inch screen, a 13-megapixel camera and dual front-facing stereo speakers. The charger gives you six hours of use after just fifteen minutes, or 24 hours from a full charge.
The Nexus 9 tablet from HTC comes with an 8.9-inch screen and an attachable magnetic keyboard that lets you rest the device on your lap like a laptop. The Nexus Player, meanwhile, is a set-top box along the lines of Roku or Apple TV that offers a browsing interface for TV and streaming video apps and also supports Google Play Games.

Fear guage  at highest level since 2011EMAIL
Stocks are falling and fear is rising on Wall Street. (Getty Images)
Fear levels on Wall Street spiked to their highest levels in almost three years today, as spooked investors reacted to another rollercoaster ride that pushed the Dow down more than 400 points.
Dubbed, the VIX, the fear gauge shot up 36% today to an intraday high of 31.06, its highest level and first climb above the 30 level, since December 2011.
When the VIX skyrockets, it is a sign that investors are spending more to “insure” their stock portfolios from steeper losses. Basically, it means that market players are buying options contracts that protects them from losses in the market.
Check out this daily chart, courtesy of Yahoo Finance, of the VIX today. It screams F E A R.
Wall Street “fear gauge” spikes to nearly two year high. Here’s today’s jump.

It s baaack: $100 curse haunts Apple againEMAIL
AP
The number Apple (AAPL) investors are trained to fear is back: $100. And investors hope the number won’t prove as disastrous as it has in the past.
Shares of the digital gadget maker closed down $1.21, or 1.2%, to $97.54. It’s a significant issue for Apple since the stock is trading down hard just after busting past $100 a share.
The last time the stock pierced $100 — the stock completely fell apart and crashed 44% before finding its footing again.
Chart source: Yahoo Finance
The $100 number looms large for Apple stock for other reasons. For one, due to Apple’s enormous market value just a $1 decline shreds up an incredible amount of wealth. More than $34 billion in wealth has been wiped out since Apple shares hit their $103.30 peak on Sept. 2, 2014. In other words, the amount of money lost by Apple since it’s peak is greater than the total value of nearly 400 of the 500 stocks in the Standard & Poor’s 500.
And here’s another problem with Apple falling — and hitting the wall at $100 a share. Since Apple is the most valuable stock in the S&P 500, when it struggles the market is directly hurt. Every $1 decline by Apple steals about 0.68 points from the S&P 500, says Howard Silverblatt of S&P Dow Jones Indices.
Certainly, there’s no rule that says that history must repeat itself. Years have passed since Apple’s shares last pierced $100 apiece. Wall Street analysts remain largely bullish – as they have for years. The average analyst rates the stock “outperform” and has an 18-month price target on the stock at $112 a share, which would be 15% potential upside. But not everyone agrees. Stock rating service Trefis — which uses an algorithm to measure the value of stocks — says Apple is worth just $96.82 a share.
Trefis.com
One thing is for certain: with so many sectors under pressure, seeing the behemoth and former leader falling is not something investors want to see.

Tata Steel in talks to sell European unitsTata Steel in talks to sell European units
Aditi Divekar | Mumbai Oct 16, 2014 12:59 AM IST
Tata Steel on Wednesday signed a memorandum of understanding with the Geneva-based Klesch group for the potential sale of its long products business in Europe and associated distribution activities. Analysts said the division accounted for 25 per cent of Tata Steel’s European operations. It produces about five million tonnes of long products like billets, wire rods and rails, and has 6,500 people on its rolls. The business could be valued around $1.3 billion, an analyst said.
The memorandum covers Tata Steel’s Scunthorpe steelworks, mills in Teesside, Dalzell and Clydebridge in Scotland, an engineering workshop in Workington and a rail consultancy in York, as well as operations in France and Germany, according to a statement by the company.

The Tata Steel global depository receipt was up five per cent after the announcement. Tata Steel employs 30,500 people in Europe, including 17,500 in the UK. The sale could upset trade unions that were expecting Tata Steel to keep investing in its European operations. “We will now move into detailed due-diligence and negotiations, though no assurance can be given about the outcome. We will regularly engage with our staff and other stakeholders throughout this process, and consult trade union representatives and works councils,” said Karl Koehler, chief executive of Tata Steel's European operations.

Explaining the rationale for this decision, Koehler said: “We are making huge strides on our strategic journey to become a premium, customer-centred steel company thanks to investment in equipment, technology and customers, together with the substantial contributions from our employees.”
The European steel industry is emerging from one of the most challenging periods in its history. Tata Steel has invested £1.2 billion in its UK operations since acquiring Corus in 2007.
“We are extremely disappointed with the way Tata Steel has handled this announcement, which does not reflect well on Tata’s values,” said Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of the Steelworkers’ Union Community.
“Tata Steel has failed to consult at all with the trade unions before making this move, which could have serious consequences for employees and contractors right across Tata Steel, not just within the long products business that it wants to sell. The fact that Tata Steel wants to abandon half of its European operations and pull out of an entire strategic market does not bode well for the future and ends Tata Steel’s vision to be a global steel player," international media reported quoting the unions.
Analysts said the move would help the company to restructure its European operations. “The long product division accounts for about 4.5-5 million tonne capacity, which is 25 per cent of Europe’s existing capacity of 17 million tonnes,” said an analyst with a foreign brokerage.
“The company’s long product division was not doing well,” said Giriraj Daga, senior analyst with Nirmal Bang Securities. “They did manage to get a few orders but overall it was not doing good,” he said. On the likely valuation of the deal, Daga said, “Noting the capacity of the division and keeping in mind the enterprise value, I think Tata Steel should look for at least $1.3 billion from the sale of the unit.”
“The decision by Tata Steel to sell its long products division has nothing to do with the financial health of Tata Steel as a company. Tata Steel is actually in good financial health with estimates that point towards better financial performance in the next couple of years," said Sourindra Banerjee,  assistant professor of marketing at the Warwick Business School.

Snapdeal to raise $600 millionSnapdeal to raise $600 million
BS Reporter | New Delhi Oct 16, 2014 12:50 AM IST
To compete with the billions of Flipkart and Amazon, leading marketplace player Snapdeal is expected to announce its largest round of fund-raising soon. According to sources, the company is likely to raise $600 million from existing investors, led by Japan's SoftBank Corp.
Two months ago, Flipkart had announced it was raising $1 billion. This was followed by Amazon's announcement of investing $2 billion in India.
When asked about its fund-raising plan, Snapdeal declined to comment. Other key investors in the company include eBay, Kalaari Capital, Nexus Venture Partners, Bessemer Venture Partners, Intel Capital and Saama Capital, Temasek, BlackRock Inc, Myriad, Premji Invest and Tybourne and IndoUS Venture Partners.
MONEY IN THE BANK
Jan 2011: Nexus Venture Partners and Indo-US Venture Partners  $12 million
July 2011: Bessemer Venture Partners, Nexus Venture Partners and Indo-US Venture Partners  $45 million
June 2013: ebay, Bessemer Venture Partners, Nexus Venture Partners and Indo-US Venture Partners  $50 million
Feb 2014: ebay, Kalaari Capital, Nexus Venture Partners, Bessemer Venture Partners, Intel Capital and Saama Capital and other existing investors $133 million
May 2014: Temasek, BlackRock Inc, Myriad, Premji Invest and Tybourne $100 million
Snapdeal has raised $340 million in five rounds of funding so far and is valued at an estimated $1.2 billion. Founded in 2010 by Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal, the company works on a controlled market place model and has about 50,000 sellers listed on its website. The company recently got investment from Ratan Tata in his personal capacity. It has also tied up with Croma, a Tata group company focused on consumer electronics and durables, for an exclusive partnership.
Rohit Bansal, chief operating officer of Snapdeal, had recently told Business Standard that the firm would expand into new categories and open its transit centers across 30 more cities. At the moment, Snapdeal has transit centres across 40 cities. "From the current headcount of about 1,500 people, we will expand to more than 2,600 in the next one or two years," Bansal had said.
The company plans to have 500,000 square feet of transit space in the next 12 months. Acquisitions in payments, big data, and technology are among the other things that Snapdeal is upbeat about. Same-day and next-day delivery will be further expanded to 15 cities this year. Currently, this is offered only in the key metro cities. Working on the Alibaba model in India, Snapdeal also sells in bulk (business to business) in certain categories. Singapore-based Temasek and Hong Kong's Myriad are the common investors in Snapdeal.
Snapdeal was among those to make the most from the glitches in the 'big-billion' sale by Flipkart on October 6, and got positive customer reviews for its assortment of products and discounts.

(CNN) -- The stock market's recent jitters have made many investors wonder whether there's a new financial crisis just around the corner. Well, of course there isn't -- because we've never really left the last one.
Financial crises of the scale of the 2007 crash only really end when their causes are unwound by debt repayment, bankruptcies, debt write-offs, and inflation.
In the 1930s, there was plenty of all four. The end result was that US private debt fell by almost 100% of GDP from its deflation-spiked peak of 130% in 1933, to a low of 35% at the end of WWII.
By comparison, the debt cutting we've been through so far in this crisis is trivial -- a fall of under 20% from a far higher peak of 175% in 2010.
We're attempting an economic revival from a debt level that exceeds the worst level reached during the 1930s.
And we thought this was going to work?
It has and will, of course, for a while. So long as we're willing to borrow more than we repay, there will be growth. Rising debt means there is more money in the system, driving up the economy.

Dow suffers biggest point drop of 2014
Boo! October is often scary for stocks
That has been happening since early 2010, when the deleveraging that caused the 2007 crisis stopped, and Americans began to borrow again.
But with private debt still at levels that make the late 1920s seem like a period of sobriety rather than Great Gatsby excess, the headroom to keep on borrowing simply isn't there. So the economic revivals are likely to peter out much more rapidly than they did back in 1990, when debt peaked at "only" 120% of GDP.
Nowhere is this more evident than in that ultimate casino, Wall Street. There, margin debt has already returned to the peak it reached back in the biggest stock market bubble of all time, the DotCom bubble.
The increase then was stunning: having hardly ever exceeded half a percent of GDP before 1990, it rose fivefold to 2.75% of GDP in just 8 years. We hit that peak again in March 2014 -- and we thought it could keep on rising?
Of course, we thought no such thing because, with the earnest assistance of conventional economic thinking, we convinced ourselves that leverage didn't affect stock market prices and that instead prices reflect this ethereal thing called "fundamental value."
To my eye, the real "fundamental value" is our willingness to go into debt to buy an asset.
That willingness rises as rising debt drives asset prices higher. But it also ultimately peters out, since the debt rises much more rapidly than the incomes that pay these debts off.
Then the Catch-22 of financial markets takes over: It takes not merely rising but accelerating debt to keep stock prices rising. Even a slowdown in the rate of acceleration of debt is enough to send the stock market south.
My acceleration indicator has been flagging that the stock market was due for a fall since mid-2013.
It's a tribute to the power of the Fed's Quantitative Easing that the market continued to defy the gravity of decelerating debt for so long. QE was really a program to inflate asset prices since, as my colleague Michael Hudson puts it, "the Fed's helicopter money fell on Wall Street, not Main Street".
But with QE being unwound, the stock market is now back under the control of the not so tender mercies of excessive private debt.
So welcome to the New Crisis -- same as the Old Crisis. The roller coaster ride is likely to continue.

Lex Live: Workin’ on the railroadReddit
Railroads, the industry that arguably contributed the most to United States prosperity in the 19th century, aren’t that glamorous anymore. However this week the industry is back in the news in a big way. CSX, one of seven big “ Class I ” railroads with operations in the US, is the potential acquisition target of Canadian Pacific, a top-tier rival. Both have equity values exceeding $30bn. A combination would create an unprecedented transcontinental railroad. CSX’s tracks are in the eastern United States, while CP’s lines are in the west and upper Midwest.
Commercial railroads are privately held in the US. ( The passenger service, Amtrak , is however owned by the government.) The industry is textbook example of a “ natural” monopoly , with no more than two operators in any given region. Capital costs are high so it makes sense to organise the industry around a few titans with the scale to afford necessary investments.
Those investments are massive indeed. The seven Class I railroads last year spent $15bn on capital improvements to repair and improve tracks and buy new cars. That amount represented a whopping 17 per cent of revenue, when half that ratio would be considered high in most of corporate America.
That capital investment required suggests returns on investment capital won’t be towering. (ROIC is defined as after-tax EBIT/ (total debt + shareholders equity)).
With weighted average costs of capital (WACC) typically around 10 per cent, most ROICs are right around that figure among railroads. And that is only after many have improved operations and taken advantage of a US economic recovery.
Even if percentage returns aren’t exemplary, the benefit of having big capital bases is that small improvements have a big impact in absolute dollar terms. Consider the formula for “ economic value added ”: (ROIC- WACC) * capital base. At CSX, an increase in ROIC of 200 basis points is worth $400m annually, based on total capital of $20bn.
The risk in a merger is that the premium paid exceeds any combination benefits for the acquirer. So watch whether Canadian Pacific remains disciplined in a potential bidding war.
 

10-year Treasury yield dipped below 2%Treasury yields tumble, bond prices soar

Yields on Treasury securities plunged Wednesday as investors sought a safe haven from the stock market rout, and traders realized that the global economy is entering another slowdown.
USA TODAY
The yield on the bellwether 10-year Treasury note fell as low as 1.873%, the lowest since May 2013, before settling at 2.13%. And the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell below 3%, to 2.92%. Other government bond yields plunged as well:
French 10-year government bond: 1.13%
German 10-year government bond: 0.75%
Japanese 10-year government bond: 0.48%
“Two percent looks sky-high compared to Germany,” says John Lonski, Team Managing Director of the Economics Group at Moody’s Analytics. “The bond market is finally pricing in the reality of indefinite subpar growth for aging advanced economies.”
Why the bond rally? Investors look for safety from government bonds in times of crisis. And currently, investors fear losing money through falling prices — deflation — rather than through rising prices, or inflation.
The specter of deflation is haunting the markets. Oil prices have plunged to four-year lows on lower demand and bountiful production. The implied inflation rate for the next 30 years, based on 30-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, is just 2.09%. For the next 10 years, the implied inflation rate is 1.85%.
Even in China, one of the world’s most rapidly growing economies, inflation is a low 1.6% — primarily because of stagnating wages. “Chinese wages are going nowhere,” Lonski says.
And signs of slowdown in the U.S. point to deflation, not inflation. Despite rock-bottom mortgage rates, for example, the 52-week average of the Mortgage Bankers’ index of home buyers’ applications is at the lowest since March 1996, Lonski says. Baby Boomers, once a driving force in the economy, are spending less — partly because those who have lost their jobs in the past five years must settle for sharply lower wages. “They’re going to get contract jobs and do the same work they did previously at lower wages,” Lonski says.
The plunge in bond yields means that the Federal Reserve could delay raising rates until late in 2015, and could even be tempted to embark on another stimulus program. From the Fed’s point of view, an outburst of inflation would be far easier to combat than widespread deflation.
The Fed can attack inflation by raising rates, but it has little room to push rates down further. “There are not a lot a lot of bullets left if things get worse,” says Bill Irving, portfolio manager of Fidelity Government Income fund.
The bonus for the worried: When bond yields fall, bond prices rise. For example, iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (ticker: TLT), soared 2.4% early Wednesday, before settling at a 0.76% gain, says Morningstar. The 10-year T-note yield has fallen nearly a full percentage point since the end of 2013, when it yielded 3.03%. Investors in the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond have seen their shares soar 16.5% this year.
And, says Irving, mortgage rates are headed south again. Quicken Loans posted a 3.875% rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, Irving notes, making this a good time to refinance a high-rate mortgage.
 

Markets rally sharply into the close  Dow down 170NASDAQ
---
Decliners were one step ahead of advancers on the New York Stock Exchange in the close, with an exchange volume of 1.2 billion and a composite volume of 6.1 billion, the highest in nearly three years.
Just before 2 p.m. ET, volume on the New York Stock Exchange matched "normal" volume for the entire session—3.5 billion shares.
"It's significant because people are truly unloading their positions," JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade, said. "Once we broke that 200-day moving average [people said] let's get out and start over."

The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) , widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, cut half its gains after rising as much as 35 percent to trade above 30, its highest level since November 2011.
The U.S. 10-year Treasury note yield dipped below 2 percent for the first time since May 2013, while U.S. economic data was weaker than expected.
In the morning, European stocks closed more than 2 percent lower on Wednesday as investors shunned risky assets on fears of crumbling global growth, weak economic data, and concerns about the political situation in Greece.
"We're probably going to follow the Europe" markets," Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital, said. Despite stocks closing in the red, he saw some signs of stability.
"I think investors should take advantage of this selloff," he said.
Kim Forrest, senior equity analyst at Fort Pitt Capital, agreed.
"The correction from the top is giving us room to buy companies that we like," she said. "If you are long-term investor, three to five years, this should not be a concern."
Pisani: Massive volume, somebody buying
CNBC's Bob Pisani reports on panic selling near Wednesday's market open, and what the news AbbVie is rethinking its acquisition of Shire plc has to do with the major moves.
In the United States, transports recovered completely to close up 0.23 percent after a fall of about 2 percent in late morning trade led by a decline in airlines on reports that the new Ebola patient flew the day before falling ill. However, analysts said there were no reports of flight cancellations due to the disease and added that the news had more of a psychological effect.
"Ebola is in the background," said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group. "It feeds generally into global growth concerns."
Stocks held to a downward trend after the Fed released its "Beige Book" that said the economy is growing at a "modest to moderate" pace.
In the hour before the close, Wal-Mart fell more than 3 percent on news that the retailer cut its growth guidance.
The reports "helped exaggerate anxieties investors had recently on full valuations," Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, said. "I think markets are working off technical levels."
Business inventories rose less than expected in August, and U.S. retail sales fell 0.3 percent in September, slightly more than the expected 0.2 percent decline. The producer price index for September fell 0.1 percent as opposed to expectations of a 0.1 percent gain.
"In general the only news the market reacts to now is negative news," Hogan said. Even "economic data is just background noise."
Overall, analysts focused on technicals and didn't think markets were seeing capitulation .
"I think this is just a correction," said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. "I'm a long ways from saying we're heading into a bear market."
"The only good stuff is the earnings, but that's backward looking," he said. "We're going to have a pretty solid earnings season."
He added that the pullback would likely cause the Fed to postpone an interest rate hike and that low rates were pressuring financial institutions' profit margins.

U.S. stock index futures lost about 1 percent, with the Dow futures losing more than 150 points, as investors were unnerved by word of another Ebola case diagnosed in the U.S. Also driving futures lower was a major drop in the Greek markets that drove a flight to safety in German bunds, with the 10-year bond trading below 0.8 percent. Other concerns included a deteriorating euro zone economic outlook, fed by another credit rating blow for France, and "free falling" inflation expectations dominated the market.

IndiGo places order for 250 A320neo planesIndiGo places order for 250 A320 Neo planes
BS Reporter | Mumbai: Oct 16, 2014 12:57 AM IST
In the largest single order for aircraft maker Airbus, budget carrier IndiGo on Wednesday signed an agreement to buy 250 A320neo planes, taking its number of aircraft on order to 430.
The companies did not disclose the deal value. Going by the list price, it could be $25.7 billion, though airlines usually get a discount in such deals. And, the memorandum of understanding between the two will still have to be confirmed.
Before this, IndiGo had made two mega orders for Airbus aircraft — for 100 A320s in 2005, and 180 planes (30 A320s and 150 A320neos) in 2011. The 2011 order, though, was later modified to 180 A320neos. Airbus has said the A320neos, with their new engines and enlarged wing-tip devices, will deliver fuel savings of 15 per cent from day one.
ALSO READ:  We will be number one in India: Airbus
IndiGo President Aditya Ghosh said the deliveries under the new order would begin from 2018 and overlap with those under the 2011 one.
“This new order reaffirms IndiGo’s commitment to long-term development of affordable air transportation in India and abroad. Additional aircraft will enable us to continue to bring our low fares and hassle-free service to more customers and markets. These will also create more job opportunities and growth,” he added.
Even as its domestic peers, burdened with financial issues, are limiting expansion, IndiGo has been expanding fast; it flies 83 planes at present. By November, the country’s largest carrier — and the only profitable one — will complete induction of 100 planes from its 2005 order (two years ahead of schedule). It will also take 12 planes on lease from Tigerair to stay ahead of competition. The deliveries of A320neo planes under its 2011 order will begin from October next year.
IndiGo follows a sale-and-leaseback model. While most of its planes are on lease for six years, a few are on financial lease for 10-12 years.
Last month, it signed an agreement with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China for financing of 30 A320neos, valued at $2.6 billion.
“We were expecting IndiGo to also place a smaller order for narrow-bodied aircraft with options to convert to A330neos, besides regional aircraft. In the near term, the carrier is likely to launch operations in other countries through joint ventures; and, it could also make an initial public offering this financial year. This MoU will help it bolster the perception of it as a solid long-term player,”' said Kapil Kaul, chief executive for Indian sub-continent & West Asia, Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation.
Incidentally, the announcement came even as IndiGo’s net profit in 2013-14 fell 60 per cent from a year earlier.
Large orders could enable IndiGo to negotiate for better prices and give it the cost advantage over rivals, say experts. No other Indian airline has placed such big offers. Among peers, GoAir has ordered 72 Airbus A320neos and SpiceJet for 42 Boeing 737 Max. Jet Airways is also planning to buy Boeing 737 Max but has not disclosed the number of aircraft it will place an order for.
AirAsia Malaysia has on order 264 Airbus A320neos, many of which would be leased to AirAsia India from 2016.

Beats  the NFL  and Guerrilla MarketingHis preferred color is pink.
Photo by Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images
This article originally appeared in Inc .
Determining what your brand stands for is Marketing 101, but you shouldn't overlook the importance of deciding what it opposes. Brand identity expert David Brier offers three examples:
Advertisement
Apple opposes technology that gets in the way of user experience.
Nike opposes couch-potatoism.
Dyson opposes technological complacency.
Recently  Beats Music , which Apple acquired in January for $3 billion, has demonstrated that it, too, has a firm grasp of what it opposes. Specifically, Beats has positioned itself as a brand opposing institutional authority. What could be a better, brasher position for an audacious company co-founded by music mogul Jimmy Iovine and hip-hop immortal Dr. Dre?
Here's how Beats did it: Shortly after the San Francisco 49ers defeated the Kansas City Chiefs on Oct. 5, quarterback Colin Kaepernick wore pink Beats by Dre headphones to his widely televised postgame presser.  Kaepernick has an individual sponsorship deal with Beats.   
The problem? The NFL has an exclusive sponsorship agreement with Bose, another maker of headphones.
While at first it appeared as if Kaepernick's wearing of the headphones might have just been a coincidence rather than a deliberate guerrilla marketing ploy on Beats' behalf, the latter soon emerged as a distinct possibility. Here's what happened, according to  ESPN's Paul Gutierrez:
And while his headphones were bright pink, purportedly to pay homage to Breast Cancer Awareness, Kaepernick paid for the indiscretion. He said Thursday the league fined him $10,000. So did Beats, with whom he has an endorsement deal, pay his fine? "I'm going to let that be unanswered," Kaepernick said.
In other words, Beats (in all likelihood) did a masterful job of guerrilla marketing.  The media coverage of Kaepernick's harmless rebellion has easily exceeded whatever publicity $10,000 could buy. More than this, Kaepernick inspired the NFL-defiance of two other quarterbacks: Carolina Panthers QB Cam Newton and New England Patriots QB Tom Brady both sported Beats  during their pregame warmups on Sunday, Oct. 12.
Another player, Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman, did the same thing during his pregame warmups, three hours later. (There's been no word, as yet, about whether Newton, Brady, and Sherman were handed the same punitive measures.)
On Monday night, Oct. 13, following the 49ers victory over the St. Louis Rams, Kaepernick struck back, with humor. At his postgame press conference, he once again wore his pink Beats headphones. But this time, to avoid a fine,  he put white masking tape over the Beats logo , which is a curling lowercase B. Talk about letter of the law. 
Interestingly, the NFL has taken some heat for fining Kaepernick. The general sentiment has been this: Doesn't the $10 billion NFL, with all of its off-the-field problems , have more important things to worry about?
It's not the first time the NFL has come under fire for seeming greedy. For example, when the NFL announced in February that it was adding Thursday nights to its TV schedule, the reaction from fans and observers was not one of unmitigated excitement. You might recall  Mark Cuban himself, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, told ESPN that the NFL was breaking a cardinal rule of good business:
Just watch. Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered. When you try to take it too far, people turn the other way. I'm just telling you, when you've got a good thing and you get greedy, it always, always, always, always, always turns on you. That's rule No. 1 of business.
When this is how a wildly successful entrepreneur like Cuban critiques your league's business decisions, chances are that the general public is also leery. Realizing this, Beats knew football fans would be sympathetic to Kaepernick's opposition—perhaps even more so if the NFL fined him for it. 
To be sure, Bose has done nothing wrong here. And the NFL would also be behaving badly—like a poor sponsorship partner—if it didn't somehow respond to Kaepernick's actions. Beats took advantage of this quandary and, in doing so, proved again why it's not only an audacious brand, but also a smart one.

U.S. stocks rebound from scary plungeMarket 'freak out': Stocks rebound from scary plunge
By Matt Egan   @mattmegan5 October 15, 2014: 4:29 PM ET
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
Don't blink. Otherwise you're bound to miss a wild swing in this increasingly-violent stock market.
It was a memorable day on Wall Street as the Dow plummeted 460 points before staging a late rally to end down "only" 173 points. The Nasdaq briefly fell into correction territory, indicating a 10% drop from a prior high, but rebounded sharply to finish the day barely in the red.
"It was an emotion and panic-filled day both in and out of assets. You flushed out a lot of panicked longs and you're getting a knee-jerk bounce. What this means going forward, I don't know," said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group.
Late-day heroics: The factors behind the early losses were obvious and plentiful: slow economic growth, rising Ebola fears and continued uncertainty about the Federal Reserve. The reasons for the rebound were less clear, though beaten-down stock prices appeared to entice buyers to step off the sidelines.
Just look at the Nasdaq, which closed a whopping 2.4% above its low point for the day.
The Russell 2000, a basket of small-cap stocks that has recently taken a big hit, actually rallied over 1% Wednesday.
"$SPY $QQQ impressive comeback from the bottom," StockTwits user Zachi wrote.
Despite the late-day heroics, the recent slide on Wall Street has wiped out a whopping $1.5 trillion of market value from the S&P 500, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.
Fear continues to grip the stock market. This week CNNMoney's Fear & Greed Index has tumbled to zero, indicating "extreme fear," for the first time since 2011.
As investors flee risky assets like stocks, they are rushing into U.S. government bonds , which are seen as safe havens during times of market stress. The yield on the 10-year Treasury broke below 2% on Wednesday for the first time since mid-2013.
"We have a really toxic cocktail of negatives" that are "conspiring to put pressure on the markets," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities.
Related: Investors love U.S. bonds right now
The hardest hit stocks: The market has been jittery the past few weeks because Europe, especially Germany , isn't doing well. But now there is concern about the U.S.
Retail sales unexpectedly shrank last month for the first time since January, according to a government report this morning. Retailers like Macy's ( M ), Home Depot ( HD ) and J.C. Penney ( JCP ) dropped sharply on the news.
Also a new report showed inflation at the producer level dipped for the first time in over a year. Shrinking prices are not a sign of a healthy economy.
"People are truly frightened about the global growth picture," said John Canally, chief economist strategist at LPL Financial.
Related: Crashing oil prices could crush Vladimir Putin
American Airlines ( AAL ) and Delta Airlines ( DAL ) dropped early in the day as word spread that the new Ebola patient flew the day before being diagnosed. Other travel stocks like Carnival ( CCL ) cruise line and Hilton Worldwide ( HLT ) were also being hit as investors fear further fallout.
Close to a correction: Many market watchers believe a correction (a 10% decline from previous high) is long overdue. Such a downward move could even be healthy because it could lure in buyers who have been waiting on the sidelines for cheaper prices.
"Now is actually an attractive entry point for many investors," Merrill Lynch Wealth Management wrote in a note on Wednesday. "For investors who aren't used to the feel of turbulence, it's a reminder that this is the just fourth market pullback of 5% or more in two years (whereas the historical average is about three times a year)."
The S&P 500 hasn't suffered a correction since the one that ended in October 2011. To put that in perspective, Hollywood has had time to churn out three different Xmen movies over that span .
The S&P 500 needs to close below 1,810 to be in correction territory, based on its September 18 closing high of 2,011.36. It traded as low as 1,820 on Wednesday before ending at 1,862.
The Nasdaq slipped under 4,138 -- its correction level -- briefly today before rebounding to close at 4,215.
The Dow isn't far off from correction status either. It would need to dip below 15,552, compared with its close of 16,142.
All three major indexes remain far from bear market status. That more serious condition indicates a 20% decline from a previous high. Wall Street hasn't had a bear market since the financial crisis, though it came close during the last correction.

Steve Schwarzman s advice - go study in ChinaSteve Schwarzman's advice to future leaders - go study in China
By Cristina Alesci   @cristinaalesci October 15, 2014: 3:55 PM ET
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
Buyout giant Stephen Schwarzman raised $300 million for a scholarship program in China. Now, it's time to put the money to work.
Schwarzman Scholars plans to select students who want to have a "positive impact on the world" and send 200 of them a year to Tsinghua University in Beijing. There, they will live and take classes at Schwarzman College -- a brand new building that was financed with the new funds.
It's modeled on the residential college systems of Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard and Yale.
The class work includes leadership, pulling on case studies from the Harvard Business School, and Chinese history.
A rising power creates both great opportunities and great issues, said Schwarzman,who was echoing Henry Kissinger at a kickoff event for the program. The room was packed with representatives from schools including Columbia, Princeton and Yale and high profile supporters like hedge fund manager Bill Ackman.
They have pledged to help Schwarzman meet his goal of fostering a better understanding of China.
The private equity billionaire addressed a crowd of about 100 people in what had been John Pierpont Morgan's private library -- lined with rare books and manuscripts, the library is part of New York's Morgan Library and Museum.
Schwarzman, who considers the scholars program the most significant of its kind since the Rhodes Trust was founded in 1902, donated the first $100 million. Outside companies and financiers contributed the remaining $200 million at various levels.
Energy company BP is listed at the top tier. Delta Air Lines is among the second layer of supporters.
Schwarzman is looking for another $50 million. "If anyone wants to step up, don't be shy,'' he said.

Real story: Why and how SEBI went after DLFPrint
By Mail Today Bureau in Mumbai
All it took was a complaint by a Delhi- based businessman and sham transactions involving three ‘housewives’ to prod Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to DLF and its top executives from the securities market.
According to news agency PTI, Sebi passed the order after Kimsuk Krishna Sinha complained on June 4, 2007, that Sudipti Estates and certain other persons had duped him of Rs 34 crore in relation to a transaction between them for purchase of land, and he had also registered a first information report against Sudipti, one Praveen Kumar and others in that regard.
The case relates to non- disclosure of these transactions and the related risks when DLF raised Rs 9,187.5 crore through an initial public offering. Sudipti had only two shareholders— DLF Home Developers Limited (DHDL) and DLF Estate Developers Limited (DEDL)— both the wholly- owned subsidiaries of DLF, Sinha had alleged. Sudipti, DHDL and DEDL were sister concerns and inextricably linked and these companies were a part of the DLF Group, he further alleged. I N his second complaint on July 19, 2007, Sinha said that DLF was denying its or its subsidiaries’ connection with Sudipti at that point of time. He, however, claimed that DLF’s claim of not having any association with Sudipti was false. When asked by Sebi, DLF denied the allegations.
Sebi order on DLF: 10 things to know
Not being satisfied with DLF’s response, Sinha filed a Writ Petition before Delhi High Court, which asked Sebi to probe the matter in April 2010. After looking into further appeals by Sudipti and DLF, the High Court passed another order in July 2011 directing Sebi to examine the matter. Subsequently, Sebi ordered a probe into the allegations made by Sinha and issued show- cause notices in June 2013 to DLF and its top brass.
Sebi further said that Sudipti and two other companies— Sha- lika Estate Developers Private Limited and Felicite Builders & Construction— were incorporated on March 26, 2006. On November 29, 2006, the entire shareholding in Felicite was sold to individuals Madhulika Basak, Niti Saxena and Padmaja Sanka, who were wives of three DLF key management personnel (KMP)— Surojit Basak, Joy Saxena and Ramesh Sanka respectively. The next day, the entire shareholding of DLF subsidiaries in Shalika was sold to Felicite while the entire shareholding in Sudipti was sold to Shalika.
The three shareholders who, pursuant to purchase of shares of Felicite from DLF subsidiaries, became 100- per cent shareholders of Felicite, which in turn became 100 per cent shareholder in Shalika and which in turn became 100- per cent shareholder in Sudipti, were spouses of KMPs of DLF. These three shareholders were not regular investors/ traders in the securities market though they claimed that they purchased entire shares of Felicite for the purpose of investment in real estate sector.
All the three transferees were ‘ housewives’ and held bank accounts jointly with their husbands, Sebi said. Considering the fact that all these three shareholders were ‘ housewives’ and that the payment towards their purchases of shares of Felicite were made from the joint accounts held with their respective husbands, it has been alleged that DLF never lost control of Sudipti, Shalika and Felicite, Sebi said in its notice.

Buzz off  says Delhi to US Trade RepresentativeIndia says will not cooperate with US on IPR regime review
Nayanima Basu | New Delhi Oct 16, 2014 12:50 AM IST
The Government of India has told American authorities that it will not cooperate with the out-of-cycle review (OCR) initiated by the Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) as part of the latter’s annual ‘Special 301 Report’, on India's supposedly slack intellectual property rights (IPR) regime.
New Delhi says it believes what the USTR is doing is unilateral and it is not “obliged” to participate or cooperate in the OCR process. However, it is geared to cooperate with the Indo-US bilateral dialogue mechanisms.
“India will engage with the US on IPR issues under the US-India IP working group that was recently formed when Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited US. Apart from that, we are not ready to cooperate on anything else on this issue,” said a top official, who requested anonymity.
The official also said India was coming out with a comprehensive IPR Policy, which would “settle the matter” forever.
The length of the OCR depends from country to country. The process starts with the USTR publishing in the Federal Register a request for the public to give its comments. It is generally open-ended and anyone can give comments — the American public and companies or anyone else.
Once all the comments are collated within a stipulated time, which in this case is October 31, it will be sent to the relevant government (India, in the present case) for reactions. A month is given to respond.
With India refusing, the US has plans to take up the matter strongly under the high-level IP working group, which will begin during the next India-US Trade Policy Forum (TPF), slated to take place here next month.
“The Indian government has stated that it will not participate in the process and not provide any input. We are waiting to have the meeting of the high-level working group (on IPR) and then talk to the Indian government on OCR, as this is a major engagement,” a USTR official involved in OCRs told Business Standard from Washington.
The official said the length of the OCR had not yet been determined, although it was not expected to be lengthy and “certainly not a permanent process”.
Under the Special 301 Report, issued this year on June 30, India continues to be kept on the ‘Priority Watch List’ (PWL) for being one of the worst IP offenders, according to American standards. As a result, USTR had decided to carry out an OCR to “engage more deeply” with India on IPR and patent laws, which it believes are not up to the mark.
India, on the other hand, has maintained that it is in compliance with the global IPR norms under the World Trade Organization’s agreement on Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights.
The USTR began conducting an OCR of India from Tuesday, in an effort to “redouble” its engagement with the country on IP issues related to all sectors, especially concerning access to affordable medicines.
India has been in the ‘priority watch list’ since 1989, when Special 301 was first issued by the USTR. However, this is the first time the US authorities are conducting an OCR of India’s IP and patent laws.

Impure TamiliansSpecial Arrangement A still from the movie Madras.
Special Arrangement A still from the movie Madras.
TOPICS
Tamil cinema
The reviews for the Tamil film Madras suggest that most English-language writers are divorced from a certain kind of reality
Pa Ranjith’s Madras is the work of a good, thoughtful filmmaker. It’s a supremely well-made film, but not especially well-written. The narrative superstructure is derivative, and Ranjith doesn’t do enough to make his film different. Or so I thought till I posted my review and began to receive comments. The context is this: I saw the film as one of those many films about the nameless, faceless masses that make up the poorer parts of Madras (given this film, it wouldn’t do to call the city Chennai). But where I – and, apparently, almost every other English-language reviewer – saw a generic group of lower-income-group people, commenters have been pointing out instances from the film to make a case that these characters are from a specific community. They’re Dalits.
I reproduce (with some editorial intervention, for clarity) what a commenter called masilan said, because I think it needs to be heard: “Madras is a film which speaks about contemporary Dalit politics in TN. The character Anbu personifies that section of the Dalit youth who wanted to uplift Dalit society by achieving political power whereas the character Kali stands for that section of Dalits who have used the affirmative policies of the Indian constitution and remain aloof about the condition and empowerment of Dalits. What Kali wants/is concerned about is his happiness alone.”
“Conversations between Anbu and Kali are very important as they send out the message to the audience (Dalits in particular) that what is needed to bring a real change in the conditions of this community is political awareness along with education. Only a person with political awareness (Anbu) will be able to fight against the oppression/injustice the society has done to the Dalits... There are enough instances of scenes and dialogues which scream out loudly that this film is all about Dalits and their politics and how they are kept suppressed eternally. This is also about the betrayal of their own men towards their community... In India, Ambedkar is now reduced to being only a Dalit leader and his photo is seen in Anbu’s house… Anbu’s wife is named Mary and Anbu is shown placing a document before the photo of Mother Mary, suggesting they are Dalit Christians (large numbers of Dalits converted to Christianity to escape the oppression of Hinduism)... Kali is shown reading a book on the atrocities committed on Dalits living in Andhra... Even Thirumavalavan’s (leader of a Dalit-based political party) poster finds its way into the movie.” And so forth.
The question he asked me was: “While all this was so clear, why wasn’t there any reference to this in your review?” The answer is simply that I drew a blank. (And I suppose most other reviewers did too.) We saw and responded to a generic story, but missed out the specifics. These specifics don’t change the film, exactly – at least in the larger sense. The narrative problems remain. The story arc is still derivative. The ending still looks gracelessly tacked on. A couple of songs still feel redundant. And even the Dalit pointers don’t seem to have been integrated all that well – for instance, if the point is to send a signal to the audience, wouldn’t it have made more sense to show the well-meaning Anbu (rather than the self-serving Kali) reading that book about atrocities committed on Dalits? But seen through this reading, how much more interesting the characters become. I see Anbu and Kali in a new light. I see Kali’s engagement ceremony in a new light. I even see why this ending needed to be there, whereas earlier I had casually dismissed it as “a disaster, the result of one of those do-gooder impulses that strikes filmmakers on occasion, when they feel they have to not just make a movie but remake a society.”
Hopefully, the director can be persuaded, at some point, to expand on all this, but what struck me, after this discussion, was how we see the things we’ve been conditioned to see. You can learn to appreciate cinema by watching films made by great directors and poring over sites about cinematography and writing and editing – but that can only tell you how the film is made. And while that is very important, it’s still only half the story. The other half is what the film is about, and picking up on that, as Madras proves, depends on a great many cultural and social factors. A reader on Facebook pointed out that my body of work remains incomplete as none of my writing involves either social or political commentary. I agree with one part of this, that I don’t really talk about these aspects – but I disagree that this makes a review “incomplete,” because there are many ways through which one can approach a film, and screenwriting/aesthetics is my prism, just as someone who speaks about the political and social aspects may not necessarily talk about the filmmaking as such. It’s all these people, with all these concerns and all these viewpoints, that will bring about a corpus of writing that comprehensively represents the film. No single review/reviewer can hope to do that. Commenters have to chip in.
The other cultural factor is that most English-language writers (and therefore reviewers) are divorced from a certain kind of ground reality. They are schooled in English, and they take their cues from English sources – by which I mean, for instance, that a “well-read person” from this milieu is more likely to have read Anna Karenina than Silappadikaram. Socially, too, his milieu is similarly chalked out. Most of the kids in school are like him. Most of the people at his white-collar office are like him. Ideally, it would be both – we would have the best of worlds, bits from here and there. But this rarely happens. I am reminded of an anecdote from my book Conversations with Mani Ratnam, when we were talking about Roja and he recalled the time he narrated the story to the producer K Balachander. KB liked the story but didn’t like the title, which reminded him of a brand of paakku thool, crushed betel nut. “I was amazed,” Ratnam said. “I thought the title represented Kashmir because the rose is something beautiful but with thorns... But he said [it’s like paakku thool]. Trust a pure Tamilian to come up with that.” I asked Ratnam, “Don’t you consider yourself a pure Tamilian?” He smiled and said, “Tamil medium-la padichaa dhaan pure Tamilian.” (“You’re a Tamilian only if you’ve studied in a Tamil-medium school.”) He was being somewhat facetious, but then again, maybe not. Sometimes we become so global that we forget the local.

The Nobel winner Pakistan wont celebrateprint

The 2014 Nobel Peace Prize for Malala Yousafzai has been officially welcomed in Pakistan, but there is one Pakistani Nobel Prize winner the country continues to ignore and scorn: Abdus Salam, an Ahmadiya Muslim, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979.    
The Ahmadiya community reportedly faces persecution in Pakistan, where the constitution was amended in 1974 to declare them non-Muslims. The Ahmadiya faith was founded by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad in the 19th century in Qadian town of Gurdaspur district.
“I am delighted to hear that Pakistan has gained its second Nobel. It is controversial but we can’t deny she is an amazing young girl,” said Ahmad Salam, the London-based son of Abdus Salam. However, he added the Pakistani establishment never gave his father his due.
“Pakistan still does not acknowledge my father in any official capacity. His name doesn’t appear in any history or science books. He has one small hall in Government College, Lahore, named after him, so there isn’t really any widespread recognition that he was a lifelong Pakistani or that Pakistan should be proud of him,” he added.
Ahmad Salam said his father was very touched by the warmth and affection he received during his visit to India after winning the Nobel Prize, and recalled that the then PM Indira Gandhi had offered him Indian citizenship.Other countries also offered him citizenship, but he remained a Pakistani until his death in 1996.
The 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded jointly to Abdus Salam and Harvard University professors Sheldon Lee Glashow and Steven Weinberg. The Pakistani scientist’s work played a major role in the success of the God particle project in 2012.
“Officials from Pakistan’s atomic and other agencies would travel all over the world to seek my father’s advice behind closed doors, but officially they never engaged with him, Ahmad added.
The “ultimate insult”, he said, was when authorities removed the word Muslim from his father’s tomb in Pakistan, which initially read ‘First Muslim Nobel laureate’ on the orders of the local magistrate.
The highest official representative at the funeral was the local police inspector.

In pics: Hudhud takes India by stormCyclone Hudhud hit India’s east coast with monstrous ferocity on Sunday, killing at least six people and leaving behind a trail of destruction in Andhra Pradesh and neighbouring Odisha.
 
Visakhapatnam which houses two million people and a major naval base was hammered as the cyclone made landfall at around 11.30am.
 
Winds at the speed of 200 kmph brought down power cables and steel towers besides uprooting trees and kutcha houses in the coastal districts.
 
Hudhud was likely to batter a 200-300 km stretch of coastline before losing force inland. Four districts in Andhra Pradesh that are home to more than 14 million people were likely to be worst hit, including about 350 coastal villages.
 
Out of the six deaths, three were reported from Andhra Pradesh and three from Odisha.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) imposed a ban on realty major DLF and its top executives from accessing the capital markets for three years, for suppressing information in its initial public offering (IPO) prospectus and for sham transactions.
PTI adds:
Those prohibited from the markets including Mr. Singh’s son Rajiv Singh (Vice Chairman) and daughter Pia Singh (Whole Time Director), SEBI said in its order.
“I find that the case of active and deliberate suppression of any material information so as to mislead and defraud the investors in the securities market in connection with the issue of shares of DLF in its IPO is clearly made out in this case,” SEBI’s Whole-Time Member Rajeev Agarwal said in his 43-page order.
“I am satisfied that the violations as found in this case are grave and have larger implications on the safety and integrity of the securities market. In my view, for the serious contraventions as found in the instant case, effective deterrent actions to safeguard the market integrity. It, therefore, becomes incumbent to deal with contraventions, digression and demeanour of the erring Noticees sternly and take appropriate actions for effective deterrence,” Mr. Agarwal said.
The company and its top executives are found to have violated various regulations including Sebi’s Disclosure and Investor Protection (DIP) Guidelines and the PFUTP (Prevention of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices) norms.
As per the order, those facing the ban include T.C. Goyal (Managing Director), Kameshwar Swarup and Ramesh Sanka. All of these persons, including K.P. Singh and his two children, were part of the top management at the time of filing IPO documents.
About G.S. Talwar, who was also a non-executive director at that time, Sebi said it could not be established whether he was involved in day-to-day operations of the company and therefore it was giving him “benefit of doubt”.
DLF had raised Rs. 9,187 crore through its IPO in 2007.

Love in the time of Hudhud: Breathtaking photos of man rescuing his wife in OdishaComments
Cyclone Hudhud left a swathe of destruction in parts of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, but the loss of life appeared limited after tens of thousands of people sought safety in storm shelters, aid workers and officials said. The cyclone struck just before midday on Sunday, bringing torrential rain and winds of nearly 200 kmph.
As the two states estimated the damage Hudhud had caused, photos of a man rescuing his wife at Gopalpur beach in Odisha made headlines. Little is known about the couple but they are safe. Here are images of their encounter with Hudhud.

On Sunday, police officers kept blowing whistles and waving batons to drive people away from the beach but to no avail. “We have come to Gopalpur after a long time. How can we go back without enjoying our time on the beach,” said Atanu Ghosh, a tourist from West Bengal. (Arabinda Mahapatra/ HT Photo)

Worst of cyclone Hudhud over  rain remains the worryCyclone Hudhud whipped the coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha on Sunday killing six people, with heavy rain and winds of 195 km per hour uprooting trees and damaging buildings.

Mass evacuation in the two states minimised damage to life but rain was emerging as a big worry.
Hudhud lost its intensity by evening and its speed was limited to 100-110 kmph and converted from a very severe cyclonic storm to severe storm, the IMD said on Sunday night.
However, heavy downpour was reported from the eastern parts of Andhra and southern districts of Odisha. Similar weather conditions were predicted for eastern Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh.
High-velocity winds hammered Andhra’s port city of Visakhapatnam, home to two million people and a naval base, as Hudhud made landfall at around 10:40am.
“We are unable to ascertain the situation. Seventy percent of communication has totally collapsed ... this is the biggest calamity,” Andhra chief minister Chandrababu Naidu told a TV channel.
Classified as a very severe cyclone, Hudhud left glass, asbestos and uprooted trees scattered all around the city, better known as Vizag.
 
Seventeen ships were moved offshore while the airport was closed and train services suspended.
“I never imagined that a cyclone could be so dangerous and devastating,” Reuters quoted one businessman, who was staying in a Vizag hotel, as saying. “The noise it is making would terrify anyone.”
Winds also destroyed electric poles in the adjoining Srikakulam and Vizianagaram districts, plunging the area into darkness. A few thatched houses were also blown away.
Mobile phones and internet connections were down and heavy congestion in telecom traffic also contributed to the communication blackout.
Hours before the storm crossed the coast, a man was killed in Visakhapatnam’s Kondram village in a wall collapse, another died when a tree came crashing down on him.
A death was also reported from Srikakulam district.
Angry winds and heavy rain pounded the area for more than nine hours though the India Meteorological Department had predicted the cyclone conditions would prevail for six hours.
In the state capital Hyderabad, Naidu chaired a high-level meeting to review the situation. He asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to declare the cyclone as a national calamity and requested an immediate relief of R2,000 crore.
The chief minister said that Andhra Pradesh government, for the first time in India, is using space technology with the help of Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) and National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) in disaster management.
The state government has created a Facebook page called 'AP Disaster Management' for which Facebook and Google have promoted and verified the page within an hour of its launch.
The government has also created #HudhudAP to reach out to people and get information from them on Twitter and Facebook. It is also using Whatsapp extensively.
At least 200,000 people in four districts along the coastal belt were shifted to relief camps as a precautionary measure.
In neighbouring Odisha, the government had evacuated more than 156,000 people in eight districts, moving them to cyclone shelters.
Two deaths were reported from Kendrapara while sea swept away a man in Puri, officials said. CM Naveen Patnaik reviewed rescue and relief operations. “We are constantly monitoring the situation and taking all possible precautions,” Patnaik said.
With the southern districts of Ganjam, Gajapati and Kandhamal receiving heavy rainfall, the local administration started preparations for floods if such a situation arises.

Odisha special relief commissioner P K Mohapatra said they were keeping a watch on the situation and expected the rain to subside by Monday morning. “There is no report of damage to any major installations,” Mahapatra said.
As many 26 teams — 16 of the National Disaster Response Force and 10 of the Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force — have been deployed in vulnerable places for rescue work, according to chief secretary GC Pati.
 
“We have been assured by the Centre that army teams will be ready at Raipur in Chhattisgarh and five choppers at Kalaikunda in West Bengal for our call,” he said.
 
As a precautionary measure, East Coast Railways cancelled train services on Bhubaneswar-Visakhapatnam route, while the state government stopped bus service in Ganjam, Gajapati, Rayagada, Nabarangpur and parts of Kalahandi. Private bus operators have also been asked not to operate on Monday.
According to the IMD, peak wind speeds would drop to 60 kmph by Monday afternoon. Hudhud is expected to continue to dump heavy rains in northern and northeastern India and, eventually, snow when it reaches the Himalayan mountains.
The National Crisis Management Committee met Sunday to review the situation.”According to preliminary assessment…, the communication services and power and electricity have been considerably damaged in the affected districts,” an official statement said in Delhi.

DLF head towards biggest single-day fall in over 1 yearmarket and exchange
The Securities and Exchange Board of India imposed a ban on realty major DLF and its top executives from accessing the capital markets for three years.
India's largest listed property developer DLF Ltd. slumped 10 per cent during pre-open trading, heading towards its biggest single-day fall since September 2013 after the market regulator barred the company from tapping the capital markets for three years.
The ban, a blow to the heavily-indebted real estate firm, follows what the regulator said was DLF's failure to provide key information on subsidiaries and pending legal cases at the time of its record-breaking 2007 initial public offering.

As many as 13 agreements were signed between Indian and Norwegian entities on the second and concluding day of President Pranab Mukherjee’s visit to this Scandinavian nation.
The agreements, which range from a statement of intent between the Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO) and the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment and setting up a state-of-the-art fish farming unit outside Delhi, also had IIT, Kanpur, Hyderabad University and several other educational institutions reaching accord with their Norwegian counterparts.
The President, in his address to a joint business gathering, announced that Norwegian tourists would soon be given the visa-on-arrival facility even as Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg said that Oslo would open a new consulate in Mumbai to enhance its business outreach in India.
As President Mukherjee suggested that Norway’s $900 billion-worth pension fund would increase it’s exposure to India given the new Modi government’s intent to create an enabling business climate, Ms Solberg said pension fund decisions were made independently of the government.
“Norway’s sovereign wealth [pension] fund decisions are made on the perception of the business environment,” she stressed. “They will invest where they feel they should.”
The President hoped that there would be an “early conclusion” to ongoing talks for a free trade and investment agreement between India and the four-nation European Free Trade Association, of which Norway is a key member.
Referring to the Modi government’s pitch to “Make in India”, Mr. Mukherjee said, “The Indian government is committed to a business-friendly environment – impediment-free, predictable, facilitatory and transparent.”
At a separate press briefing, Prime Minister Solberg stated that the Norwegian government did not direct private investment, but played the role of a “service provider” to business ventures.

Globally, Asian markets retreated and European stocks slumped to eight-month low on economic woes.
The benchmark Sensex on Tuesday fell over 34 points to end at 26,349.33 on caution ahead of key state polls, even as inflation plunged to a 5-year low and RIL posted better-than-expected earnings.
The Indian rupee also depreciated against US dollar to 61.41 intra-day from Monday’s close of 61.10.
The 30-share BSE Sensex on Tuesday opened in positive terrain at 26,537.42. It improved further to touch the day’s high of 26,550.79 tracking earnings by Reliance Industries and easing retail inflation, released on Monday after trading hours.
Selling in realty, consumer durables, IT, oil & gas, auto, tech, FMCG and capital goods, dragged down the Sensex into negative zone.
Around noon, data showed wholesale inflation in September dropped to nearly five-year low of 2.38 per cent. The Sensex finally settled down by 34.74 points, or 0.13 per cent, at 26,349.33. Intra-day, it had dipped to 26,212.01.
“It was a volatile and range-bound session ahead of the Assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana. While markets are closed on Wednesday on the account of the Assembly elections in Maharashtra, exit polls after the voting could lead to volatile trading on Thursday,” said a note from HBJ Capital.
Maharashtra and Haryana together account for 19 and 5 seats respectively in the Rajya Sabha, so a good performance by the BJP in these state elections will consolidate the party’s post in the upper house, brokers said.
Shares of DLF tanked nearly 28 per cent- in one of its worst falls- after SEBI imposed a three- year ban on the company and some top executives from markets.
Overall, 14 Sensex stocks declined led by HDFC, HDFC Bank, ONGC, Tata Motors, Tata Steel, TCS and Wipro while 16 led by BHEL, Axis Bank, SBI, Bajaj Auto and HUL rose.
The 50-issue NSE Nifty settled 20.25 points, or 0.26 per cent, down at 7,864.00 after shuttling between 7,928 and 7,825.45 on alternate bouts of buying and selling.
Globally, Asian markets retreated and European stocks slumped to eight-month low on economic woes.
Meanwhile, the provisional data released by the local stock exchanges showed that Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) sold shares worth a net Rs 671.06 crore on Monday.
Sector-wise, the BSE Realty index suffered the most by losing 9.24 per cent, followed by IT (down 0.77 per cent), Consumer Durables (0.63 per cent), Oil & Gas (0.54 per cent) and Auto (0.43 per cent). On the other hand, Power, Banking, PSU, Metal and Healthcare ended higher.

Inflation drops to 5-year low of 2.38 per centeconomy, business and finance
Wholesale Price Inflation dropped to a near five year low in September to 2.38 per cent, helped by moderation in food and fuel prices. The favourable base effect of last year has also benefited the WPI.
The WPI based inflation was at 3.74 per cent in August 2014 and 7.05 per cent in September 2013.
As per data released by the government on Tuesday, food inflation fell to a nearly 33-month low of 3.52 per cent. The sharp drop in WPI inflation, which fell for the fourth month in a row, comes close on the heels of retail inflation declining to a record low of 6.46 per cent in September.
Wholesale inflation in onion contracted to 58.12 per cent in September as compared to a contraction of 44.7 per cent in the previous month. While inflation in vegetable basket as a whole shrunk to 14.98 per cent in September, rate of price rise in potato was at 90.23 per cent from 61.61 per cent in the previous month.
The WPI inflation in the fuel and power segment, which includes LPG, petrol and diesel, declined to 1.33 per cent as compared to price rise of 4.54 per cent in August.
Commenting on the data, industry body CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee said, “Going forward, the downslide in global commodity prices led by fuel together with improved monsoon conditions and favourable policy interventions should help contain inflation and prevent prices from resuming its inflationary tendency anytime soon.”
He added the prices of manufacturing goods have also declined indicating a favourable impact on core inflation.
The inflation in milk, eggs, meat and fish continued to decline in September as well. However, there was slight increase in the prices of fruits during the period.
Inflation in manufactured products, like sugar, edible oils, beverages and cement also fell, declining to 2.84 per cent in September as against 3.45 per cent in the previous month.
Industry chamber PHDCCI said it expects a softening policy stance from RBI in the coming times. “We believe a cut in repo rate would be inevitable to revive the industrial growth and demand to pick up pace. Revival of demand scenario would pave the way for revival of investment sentiment,” it said.
The RBI, which maintained status quo in interest rate since January, will come out monetary policy review on December 2. Diesel and petrol prices are likely to come down in the wake of sliding global crude prices which is expected to further ease inflationary pressure. The Reserve Bank primarily factors in Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation while framing monetary policy. It is targeting 8 per cent retail inflation by January 2015 and 6 per cent by January 2016.
Meanwhile, wholesale inflation based on final index for July has been revised upwards to 5.41 per cent from the provisional estimate of 5.19 per cent.
The build up inflation rate in the financial year till September was at 2.61 per cent compared to a build up rate of 6.23 per cent in the same period of 2013-14.

Share price of DLF, realty major, dipped on stock exchanges on Tuesday following a ban by the capital market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on DLF and its top executives from accessing the capital markets for three years.
“Sham transactions”
The ban was for suppressing information in its initial public offering (IPO) prospectus and for “sham transactions.”
On the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), DLF tumbled by 28.46 per cent or 41.75 points to close at 104.95 compared to its previous day’s close of 146.70.
On Tuesday it touched an intra-day low of 102.70, which is also recorded as its 52-week low. The 52-week high, which was at 242.80, was recorded on June 9, this year. Today the scrip opened at 132.05.
The SEBI barred DLF and promoters, including K.P. Singh, Executive Chairman of DLF Ltd on Monday, from participating in the securities market for 3 years on the grounds that the company failed to reveal material information in its 2007 listing prospectus.
“While DLF can appeal this order, we believe this along with other recent adverse regulatory rulings and weak demand environment does not augur well for DLF. While valuations appear cheap, we maintain EW rating and reduce our price target to Rs.159 due to macro and regulatory headwinds,” said Saurabh Mishra, Analyst, Barclays India in a report. Meanwhile realty stocks lost its sheen on bourses as the sectoral index dipped by 9.24 per cent on BSE.
“DLF's inability to access capital markets could impact its fund-raising program, both at the listed company level and potential listing of its commercial assets such as Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs),” said Macquarie Research, adding, “DLF, in this case, would have to resort to large asset sales to reduce debt in the future.”

Amazon draws flak for using Hindu images

Hindu cleric Rajan Zed noted that the products that Hindu devotees were finding objectionable included 11 women’s leggings carrying images of various Hindu Gods
Online retail giant Amazon found itself facing the wrath of devout Hindus here who objected to the Seattle-headquartered corporation’s sale of women’s leggings emblazoned with images of various Hindu deities, asserting that religious sentiments were hurt by these deities adorning parts of the body.
Describing the item as “inappropriate,” Hindu cleric Rajan Zed of Nevada said, Hindus were for free artistic expression and speech, “But faith was… sacred and attempts at trivialising… Hindu gods and goddesses was disturbing to the Hindus world over.”
Mr. Zed noted that the products that Hindu devotees were finding objectionable included 11 women’s leggings carrying images of Ganesha, Shiva, Brahma, Vishnu, Muruga, Bajrang Bali, Rama, Radha-Krishna, and Kali, each priced at around $50; two drawstring pants carrying images of Ganesha and Shiva, priced at $29.95; Ganesha waist yoga pant priced at $62.00; and four sneaker shoelace decorations to tie with shoelaces carrying images of Vishnu and Durga, priced at $4.99 each.
Last month Mr. Zed, who appeared to be monitoring popular cultural icons that potentially injured the sentiments of Hindus in the U.S., identified an exhibition in Buenos Aires, Argentina, which displayed a variety of avatars of the famous, shapely children’s doll, Barbie, and her male companion Ken, including one in the form of the Hindu goddess Kali holding up a severed head.
At the time Mr. Zed said, “Hindus welcome the art world to immerse in Hinduism but [for] taking it seriously and respectfully and not for refashioning Hinduism concepts and symbols for personal agendas. Barbie-fication of Kali is simply improper, wrong and out of place.”
A request for comments on this sent to Amazon by The Hindu had not yet been answered at the time this story went to press.

Doctrine of graduated escalation
defence
Narendra Modi’s cautious, measured start has masked his discreet gradualism. Border and other provocations are moulding his policy approach, founded on the premise that preventing hostile actions hinges on India’s capacity and political will to impose deterrent costs as a response
The India-Pakistan “peace process” has produced a lot of process over the decades but no peace. While India is a vibrant, buoyant nation, Pakistan remains a notion in search of a national identity. Yet, given Pakistan’s foundational loathing of India, many among Pakistani strategic elites still pine for India’s unravelling or at least Balkanisation.
In this light, the Pakistani military has again escalated border tensions with India. Since the deadly 2008 Mumbai attacks it scripted, it has initiated intermittent exchanges of fire along the Line of Control (LoC), including this summer and then in recent days. This month’s artillery exchanges along the LoC were unusual in terms of their ferocity and the sudden eruption in violence, resulting in the highest single-day death toll in over a decade.
Difficult road to peace
In provoking a second series of firing duels along the LoC since Prime Minister Narendra Modi took office, the Pakistani military establishment — which includes the rogue Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) — was doing more than using gunfire as cover to allow Pakistan-trained militants to infiltrate into India. It was also testing the resolve of India’s new government while simultaneously undermining Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and derailing any prospect of a rapprochement with India.
Every time a Pakistani leader wishes to build better ties with New Delhi, his effort is undermined by the military masterminding a serious cross-border attack or terror strike. Indeed, it was during Mr. Sharif’s previous stint in office that a major Indian peace initiative — as symbolised by then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s bus diplomacy — collapsed spectacularly, with the bus itself getting hijacked allegorically to Kargil, triggering a war. This has served as a cautionary lesson on how the pursuit of peace can lead to war when one side’s military is not answerable to the civilian government.
The Pakistani military actually sought to test Mr. Modi soon after he won the national election. On the eve of his inauguration, ISI-backed militants stormed the Indian consulate in Afghanistan’s western city of Herat . The Pakistani plan was to take some Indians hostage and bring India under siege just as Mr. Modi took office. The plan, however, went awry as Indian security guards at the consulate heroically killed all the attackers.
The U.S. blamed the Herat attack on the same ISI front organisation it held responsible for the 2008 Mumbai strikes — the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). The LeT’s leader, Hafiz Saeed, remains the Pakistani military’s darling, with his public life mocking America’s $10-million bounty on his head and the U.N.’s inclusion of him on a terrorist list.
The daring attack in Herat, 1,000 kilometres from Pakistan, must have had the ISI’s nod. The ISI’s “S” branch — tasked specifically with aiding and abetting acts of terrorism in India and Afghanistan — handles the LeT, the Jalaluddin Haqqani network and other terror organisations. This shows that the ISI is itself a terrorist entity.
The ISI is searching for new tools and methods to bleed India. In this context, is this fountainhead of transnational terror now using Osama bin Laden’s close associate, Ayman Zawahiri? The aging Zawahri, who U.S. officials say is hiding in Pakistan, announced the formation of an Indian branch of al-Qaeda in a videotaped message released early last month. The 55-minute video, in which Zawahiri threatens terrorist strikes across India, indicates that he is not holed up in some mountain cave but ensconced in a safe house, as bin Laden was.
Pakistan’s internal dynamics
The ISI’s war by terror is a reminder that the scourge of cross-border terrorism emanates more from Pakistan’s whisky-sipping generals than its rosary-holding mullahs. The real jihadists are the self-styled secular generals, who have reared the forces of jihad and fathered the LeT, the Taliban and other terror groups. In fact, Pakistan’s descent into a jihadist dungeon occurred not under civilian rule but under two military dictators — one (Zia ul-Haq) who nurtured and let loose jihadist forces, and another (Pervez Musharraf) who took his country to the very edge of the precipice.
Another reminder is that India-Pakistan relations will be shaped largely by Pakistan’s internal dynamics, especially its civil-military relations. Although it is in India’s interest to help strengthen Pakistani civilian institutions, Pakistan’s civil society remains too weak to influence the direction of ties with India. In the absence of a structural correction to Pakistan’s historically skewed civil-military power equation, a peace dialogue with India only encourages the Pakistani military to carry out cross-border shootings, ambushes and acts of terror.
Mr. Modi and Mr. Sharif come from the political right and enjoy parliamentary majority. Both are business-oriented and eager to revive flagging economic growth at home. Yet the expectations raised by Mr. Sharif’s presence at Mr. Modi’s inauguration proved false because they failed to factor in the role of a powerful, meddling third party — the Pakistani military, which holds virtual veto power over any fundamental change to the India-Pakistan dynamic. This party is simply not ready to allow better bilateral relations because that will undermine its extraordinary power and privilege in Pakistan.
It is not an accident that this month’s border provocations by Pakistani forces followed a power struggle in Pakistan that culminated with Mr. Sharif’s wings being clipped and the military reasserting authority in foreign policy. Mr. Sharif has emerged as a diminished figure and the main loser from a crisis triggered by street protests that were tacitly backed by the army and the ISI. With the military back in the driving seat without staging an overt coup, Pakistan’s democratic transition has again been disrupted.
Such has been Mr. Sharif’s weakening that he not only had little say in the recent appointment of the new ISI chief, but also his government, at the behest of the military, has sought to re-internationalise the Kashmir issue. The intensity of ceasefire violations indeed was designed to help shine an international spotlight on Kashmir and also demonstrate as to who is in charge of Pakistan’s foreign policy.
Mortar-for-bullet response
Mr. Modi’s cautious, measured start has masked his discreet gradualism. Border and other provocations are moulding his policy approach, founded on the premise that preventing hostile actions hinges on India’s capacity and political will to impose deterrent costs in response to any aggression. In Mr. Modi’s policy of graduated escalation, pressure on the adversary begins at low levels and then progressively increases in response to the target’s continued provocations and aggression.
There was no Indian reprisal to the Herat attack, and India’s response to the summertime border shootings was circumspect. But, in keeping with the doctrine of graduated escalation, this month’s Pakistani machine-gun fire along the LoC brought a heavy response, including retaliation with 81-mm mortars, which have a range of up to five kilometres. Mr. Modi wasn’t exaggerating when he said publicly, “Pakistan has been taught a befitting lesson.”
A peace dialogue between India and Pakistan only encourages the Pakistani military to carry out cross-border shootings, ambushes and acts of terror
The mortar-for-bullet response suggests that India’s policy of appeasement since 2003 is officially over. Indeed, to underscore that times have changed, the Modi government was quick to scrap Foreign Secretary-level talks in August after the Pakistani High Commissioner in New Delhi defiantly met Kashmiri secessionists. For Islamabad, meeting Pakistan-backed Kashmiri separatists was “business as usual,” but for Mr. Modi’s government, such interaction was simply unacceptable.
Mr. Modi is showing he is no Vajpayee, whose roller-coaster policy on Pakistan traversed through Lahore, Kargil, Kandahar, Agra, Parliament House and Islamabad, inviting only greater cross-border terrorism. And Mr. Modi is clearly no Manmohan Singh, whose peace-at-any-price approach was founded on the naive belief that the only alternative to do nothing in response to terror is to go to war. So, whether it was the Mumbai attacks or a border savagery, such as a captured Indian soldier’s beheading, Dr. Singh responded by doing nothing.
The real choice was never between persisting with a weak-kneed policy and risking an all-out war. Indeed, that was a false, immoral choice that undermined the credibility of India’s own nuclear deterrent and emboldened the foe to step up aggression.
The Modi government, by building a range of options, including to neuter Pakistan’s nuclear blackmail, is indicating that Pakistani aggression will attract increasing costs. If the ISI is planning new attacks in India, with the intent to fob them off as the work of al-Qaeda’s supposed new India franchise, it can be sure that it will invite an Indian response imposing serious costs on the entire Pakistani security establishment.
Mr. Modi is clearly signalling that India’s response to the Pakistani strategy to inflict death by a thousand cuts will no longer be survival by a thousand bandages, but punitive so as to bolster deterrence and mend conduct. Given that the “do nothing” approach allowed India to be continually gored, prudent gradualism has been a long time coming.

DLF an example of why realty sector needs a watchdogDLF an example of why realty sector needs a watchdog

The stock market regulator Sebi’s crackdown on India’s biggest real estate company, DLF, is a clear indicator that the sector is in urgent need of a cleansing of the Augean stables, market experts said on Tuesday.
Sebi on Monday barred six top DLF executives, including promoter KP Singh, from accessing the securities market for three years — a move that will choke the company’s options to raise fresh funds and one that sent its stock crashing by 28% on the bourses on Tuesday.
The ban followed what Sebi said was DLF’s failure to provide key information on subsidiaries and pending legal cases at the time of its record-breaking 2007 initial public offering.
Read: Realty firm DLF, executives barred from market for 3 years
Clearly, the markets watchdog is serious about increasing transparency in a sector notorious for its opaque deals.
In the mid- to long-term, the DLF case could be the trigger for the evolution of the Indian real estate market as a whole, real estate experts said.
“The order was a surprise,” said JN Gupta, a former executive director at the regulator who now runs a shareholder advisory firm. “I think it is a bit harsh ... but the regulator is on a spree to set an example in the market.”
Experts point to recent cases such as the twin towers case in Noida, wherein the builder was ordered by the high court to refund money to people who had decided to opt out of the two 40-storey towers. In Mumbai, there was the Campa Cola society case, where demolition of 100 flats was ordered as they were allegedly constructed in violation of the sanctioned building plan.
Another case pertains to DLF itself: the Competition Appellate Tribunal upheld an order by the Competition Commission of India that imposed a Rs. 630 crore penalty on the realtor for abusing its dominant position.

All these cases have only raised the pitch for setting up of the real estate regulator, according to real estate experts.
However, the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (CREDAI), the apex body for private real estate developers in the country, said the DLF case has nothing to do with the capability of the developer to deliver a real estate product, but is about disclosures.
“Only 6% developers in the country are listed and the rest 94% are not,” said Getamber Anand, president-elect, Credai.

The United State Trade Representative’s office on Tuesday announced an out-of-cycle review (OCR) of India’s trade practices, as it had said earlier in the year it would.
But the USTR announced it won’t be re-visiting India’s designation on the priority watch-list announced in April, as part of the annual Special 301 report.
The OCR starts on Tuesday with a notice in the Federal Register requesting public to “provide all necessary information for identifying and assessing the quality of engagement with the Government of India on IP-related issues of concern”.
The review will determine if Indian trade laws and practices and its intellectual property rights regime are adversely impacting US businesses.
The review will take place along side the recently announced — during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent visit — annual high-level Intellectual Property Working Group as part of the bilateral Trade Policy Forum.
The OCR is in line with the US commitment, the USTR said, to “redouble our efforts to seek constructive engagement that will both improve IP protection and enforcement in India and support India’s efforts to achieve a ‘decade of innovation’ and advance its legitimate public policy goals, including access to affordable medicines”.
But by not revisiting the earlier designation of India as priority watch country, the USTR made clear India will not be named a  “foreign priority country”, as the worst category of trade violator from US point of view.
That’s not on the table. A growing section of US industry, led by the powerful US chamber of commerce, had demanded that India be named a “foreign priority country”.

India may soften stand to get WTO talks goingComments
India is likely to show some flexibility to get stalled talks at the World Trade Organization (WTO) moving amid indications that it may not press for protection of welfare schemes that the government may launch in the future.
Instead, New Delhi will likely insist that the global trade body agree on a roadmap to define rules on “existing” subsidies that includes India’s recently launched food security programme.
At the same time, it will insist on a “discussion” at the WTO on how to protect small and marginal farmers who move from cultivating subsidised food grains to non-subsidised cash crops in the future, government officials said.
India’s nuanced change in stance, which trade negotiators will present in the WTO’s general council meeting on October 21 in Geneva, is part of New Delhi’s broad efforts to ratify a deal on easing global customs that has remained blocked.
India took the blame for blocking WTO’s trade facilitation agreement (TFA) in July because it wasn’t bundled with a roadmap for rules on food subsidies.
The TFA was designed to make trade easier, faster and cheaper by making systems transparent and reducing red tape.
New Delhi is of the view that without a permanent solution on food subsidies, India’s public stockholding programmes such a buffer stock of foodgrains will be hampered by the present ceiling on subsidy to farmers.
The officials told HT that while as part of a revised proposal India will pitch for an indefinite “peace clause” on food security until a permanent solution is found for existing subsidy schemes, it is unlikely to insist on protection of future welfare schemes that the government could launch later, a departure from its earlier hardline position.
A “peace clause” gives legal security to member countries and protects them from being challenged under other WTO agreements.
Existing rules place a cap on food subsidies at 10% of the value of production calculated at a price of the mid-1980s. India and other countries who would breach the permissible limit under this rule want the prices to be indexed at current levels.

In a setback, India on Tuesday lost a case filed by the U.S. in the WTO against restrictions it imposed on poultry imports from America.
Giving its ruling, the World Trade Organisation’s dispute panel said restrictions imposed by India on imports of poultry from America were “inconsistent” with international norms.
In March 2012, the U.S. dragged India to the WTO against India’s ban on imports of certain American farm products, including poultry meat and eggs. India had banned imports of various agricultural products from the U.S. in 2007, as a precautionary measure to prevent outbreaks of avian influenza in the country.
“India’s Avian Influenza (AI) measures are inconsistent with [several articles]....of the SPS [sanitary and phyto-sanitary) Agreement because they are not based on the relevant international standard,” the ruling said.

This app allows you to track a user’s location, distance from you and battery level
It is quite important to have a location tracking feature, especially when it comes to family and friends. It is even more important for parents who want peace of mind knowing their children arrived safely at their destination. iOS has this feature, and many third party developers have brought this functionality to Android.
One of the most recent contributions is an app called Cabin that is the most comprehensive solution around for it hosts several features in addition to the standard tracking of location. It is currently available only for Android, but the makers are planning a version for iOS. It is quite easy to add a user. If you create an account with Cabin, you can send a direct invitation from the app. Once the other person accepts your invitation, you will be able to see his/her location, send messages, and assign tasks. The admin of a group will also be able to delete additional members or freeze their access.
When you look at someone’s location, you will also be able to see how far away they are from you, and an icon that shows their battery level. This feature punctures the “phone died” excuse of not calling or texting back. You can also create reminders for an entire group or individuals. You can also set a reminder that will notify the concerned person of a task at a given time or location. It can also pester constantly to get it done.
All the activity has minimal impact on your battery life and does not reduce your daily charge by a substantial amount. The app has a slide-out navigation system that makes it easy to switch between tasks and has a clean look focused on core content.

DLF: What about investors and home ownerscapital market
(In DLF’s case, the fault…)
Sebi's decision in DLF case is unusually harsh because of the collateral fallout and possible disproportionately large cost to other stakeholders, especially people who have bought houses in DLF projects.
The market watchdog has punished the promoters and other decision-makers for inadequate disclosures made in the prospectus when the company made a public offer of shares in 2007, but should corporate entity DLF have also been punished, and to the same extent?
Sebi has barred DLF, promoters KP Singh and Rajiv Singh , and four others from buying, selling or otherwise dealing in securities, directly or indirectly, in any manner, whatsoever, for the period of three years.
Treating corporate entity and the promoters/executives alike means that heavily indebted DLF that needs funds to complete ongoing projects will not have any capital market access for three years. It cannot raise equity to pare down debt or raise more loan funds. The company had a net debt of over Rs 19,000 crore at the end of June 2014.
It is conceivable that banks will also get jittery rolling over debt or increasing their exposure to the troubled company. Two sets of stakeholders will face the brunt of Sebi's decision. Minority shareholders who have bought company's stock lost over 25% of their value on Tuesday.
The bigger losers could be and those who have bought houses in around 25 under-execution DLF projects if there is delay. One can still justify shareholders' loss - they knowingly invested shares of a company, a risky asset, and have paid the price for not doing their homework.
The same cannot be said for those who bought houses from their life savings. Sure real estate is often more risky than even shares, but not everyone is a speculator. For most Indians, house is a lifetime of savings. Every corporate penal action will have some fall out on innocent bystanders or stakeholders such as suppliers, contactors, routines employees and workers, creditors and many others.
Therefore, a blanket rule that precludes corporate prosecution just because there will be collateral consequences is neither desirable nor justified. A company is a legal entity and it should be liable to action for every wrong doing. That decision, however, must consider the fact that a company's decisions are made by promoters, shareholders and managers.
Therefore, disproportionate share of blame and punishment must fall on them and not the corporate entity, especially when collateral consequences are large.
In DLF's case, the fault is more with the promoters/managers because Sebi action relates to inadequate disclosures in IPO. In fact, those who invested in the company's IPO can justifiably claim to be the aggrieved party. Yes , deterrent punishment is called for to clean up the Indian stock market where players get wind of almost every deal and promoters often treat listed public companies as their private property, but that need must also be tempered by some consideration of collateral consequences.
Could it have been that those responsible for providing misleading information in the public offer given a much harsher punishment, but the company let off with a stern warning?

IndiGo  GoAir to operate more flights this winter than othersIndiGo, GoAir to operate more flights this winter than others

In contrast to all competitors, no-frill airlines IndiGo, which on Wednesday placed the largest order for 250 Airbus A-320 planes, and GoAir would operate more flights this winter season, while the rest would slash their services.
Though the total number of flights to be operated by all airlines would rise to 12,305 from 11,886 last winter, all carriers, barring the two, have decided to reduce their services from the season starting later this month.
The move by most airlines to reduce their flights is a reflection of their losses as they plan to match their fleet capacity with passenger loads, so as to reduce the number of empty seats - a perishable commodity - flown. IndiGo and GoAir are the only two which have been claiming profits.
New airlines Air Costa and AirAsia India, which were not flying last year, would operate 210 and 180 flights this winter respectively, official data showed. Tata-SIA joint venture airline Vistara is yet to get its flying permit.
While IndiGo would operate 25% more flights than last year, raising the number from 2,987 to 3,733 this year, GoAir would fly 957 flights this season as against 850 last year or 12.6% more, according to the Winter Schedule filed by all airlines with aviation regulator DGCA.
No-frill airline SpiceJet would be the one to reduce the maximum number of flights -- from 2,718 last winter season to 2,277 this year, or by 16.2%, the data showed.
Air India would lower the number of its flights by only 2.6% from 1,721 last year to 1,676, while its subsidiary Alliance Air would reduce them from 244 to 210.
Jet Airways' flights would decline from 2,734 to 2,498 (by 8.6%) and JetLite's from 632 to 564 (10.8%), the data showed.
Due to foggy conditions in North India and Delhi particularly from the third week of December, DGCA has approved the schedules for small aircraft like turboprop ATRs, Bombardier's Q-400s and Canadair Regional Jets till December 14 and asked airlines flying these planes to file fresh schedules for operations from December 15, officials said.
DGCA has also directed all airlines to operate with CAT III-B compliant aircraft and trained flight crew to and from Delhi during the entire fog period, they said.
CAT-IIIB instrument landing system is a radio transmitter that provides direction for an approaching aircraft to land on a runway in thick fog, when visibility is just 150 feet.

Don t splurge  fly high: secret of Indigo co-founder s successIndiGo, India's biggest carrier, which announced Wednesday a draft deal to buy 250 Airbus aircraft, has consistently racked up profits as rivals become mired in red ink from cut-throat fare wars.
   
No-frills IndiGo has posted half-a-dozen years of straight profits -- even with high aviation fuel taxes, ramshackle airport infrastructure and vicious fare fights -- thanks to the airline's zealous cost-consciousness, analysts say.
   
Billionaire airline co-founder Rahul Bhatia is legendarily tight-fisted, telling Forbes magazine in 2010 that his credo is "thinking before spending a single dollar" and asking himself, "Do I need to spend it? Can I get away without it?"
   
The New Delhi-based carrier, co-founded by Bhatia, who is group managing director, and former US Airways chief executive Rakesh Gangwal in 2006, is unlisted.
Billionaire airline co-founder Rahul Bhatia is legendarily tight-fisted, he thinks before spending even a single dollar.

But analysts say IndiGo, which depends a lot on word-of-mouth recommendations rather than advertising, could stage a debut share offer in mid-2015.
   
IndiGo's air-hostesses, who wear smart uniforms and perky blue hats, give the airline a premium feel while its nearly 100% on-time performance has wooed customers, analysts say, giving it a 33% market share.
   
The purchase of the 250 medium-range, single-aisle Airbus A320neo aircraft -- the biggest single airplane purchase in a deal worth $25 billion -- is aimed at serving one of the world's fastest-expanding aviation markets.
   
For decades, Indians depended on the bone-jolting railway. But tens of millions now travel by plane thanks to cheap fares, sometimes as low as rail tickets, and an expanding middle-class's paycheques.
   
India's airline sector has massive potential, analysts say, with air travel penetration just 0.04 air trips per capita a year, far behind developed countries like the US with over two air trips per capita a year, according to government figures.
   
Wednesday's memorandum-of-agreement is also part of Indigo's drive to keep its fleet young to minimise maintenance and fuel costs.
   
Analysts say IndiGo has taken a leaf from budget US carrier Southwest Airlines -- flying to fewer destinations than rivals but offering more flights on those busy routes to maximise plane-capacity usage.
Read: IndiGo, GoAir to operate more flights this winter than others
   
IndiGo, which operates over 500 daily flights to over 30 Indian destinations and five abroad, has also pared costs by keeping planes in the air longer and rapid landing-and-takeoff turnarounds.
   
Still IndiGo has not been immune to India's sharp economic slowdown, reporting that its full-year profit to March 2014 nosedived by 60% to Rs. 3.17 billion ($51.6 million).
   
But IndiGo's financial performance far outdistanced other carriers. Budget rival SpiceJet, for instance, posted a record net loss of over Rs. 10.03-billion last year while another listed carrier, Jet Airways, lost Rs. 36.67 billion.

Wal-Mart Stores, the world's largest retailer, said on Wednesday it would open fewer stores in the US in the next fiscal year and ramp up spending on e-commerce.
The retailer will open 180-200 of its small format stores, called Neighborhood Markets, in the next fiscal year through January 2016, Greg Foran, head of the US business, told a meeting of investors and analysts. That compares with its plan to open 270-300 of the small format stores in the current fiscal year.
Foran said Wal-Mart would open 60-70 Super centers, its large format store, in the next fiscal year, compared with a plan for 115 openings, including conversions, this year.
Wal-Mart CEO Douglas McMillion told the meeting that the retailer would invest "a bit less than we would in stores" and invest more in e-commerce.

NEW YORK: US stocks dropped on Wednesday as economic data reinforced worries over the health of the world economy and signs emerged of slowing merger activity.
Each of the major indexes had fallen more than 2 per cent shortly after the open, sending the S&P 500 and Nasdaq into negative territory for the year, before paring losses. The Dow industrials fell into the red for 2014 on Friday.
Concern over plunging oil prices, the potential impact of global economic weakness on US earnings and the spread of Ebola have rattled markets recently. The S&P 500 is on track for its sixth fall in eight sessions and is down nearly 8 per cent since its Sept. 18 record closing high.
Worries about a slowing global economy weren't helped by data that showed US retail sales and producer prices fell in September, while manufacturing activity in New York slowed to its weakest pace since April.
"We had Empire State manufacturing coming in much lower than expected, we had retail sales coming in lower than expected, so there were signs, with this recent data, of an economic slowdown," said Andre Bakhos , managing director at Janlyn Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey.
"You couple this with fears about the spread of Ebola, with the recent downtrend and what we had today, the mindset has been a flight to safety and cash is certainly a safe place to be in."
Chicago-based AbbVie threw the pace of merger and acquisition activity into doubt. It said it was reconsidering its $55 billion takeover of Shire, weeks after the US government moved to curb deals designed to reduce tax. US-listed shares of Shire tumbled 22.4 per cent to $189.76 while AbbVie shares advanced 1.6 per cent to $55.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 195.34 points, or 1.2 per cent, to 16,119.85, the S&P 500 lost 21.94 points, or 1.17 per cent, to 1,855.76 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 41.28 points, or 0.98 per cent, to 4,185.90.
In earnings news, Bank of America shares were off 3 per cent to $16.03 after posting its third-quarter results. The S&P financial sector fell 2.1 per cent as the worst performing of the ten major S&P sectors, all of which were in negative territory.
S&P 500 companies are expected to show earnings growth of 6.7 per cent in the third quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data, with revenue growth expected at 4 per cent.
Later in the session at 2:00 p.m. (1800 GMT) the Federal Reserve's Beige Book on business activity across the nation is expected.
The largest per centage gainer on the S&P 500 was Southwestern Energy, up 4.1 per cent, while the largest per centage decliner was KeyCorp , down 6.1 per cent.
The largest per centage gainer on the Nasdaq 100 was NXP Semiconductors , up 2.2 per cent, while the largest per centage decliner was Liberty Interactive, down 4.1 per cent.
Declining issues were outnumbering advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,116 to 896, for a 2.36-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 1,578 issues were falling and 971 advancing for a 1.63-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.
The benchmark S&P 500 index was posting 2 new 52-week highs and 68 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 5 new highs and 206 new lows.

Five things to watch out for in TCS Q2 resultsFive things to watch out for in TCS Q2 results

(The street is counting on…)
MUMBAI: The street is counting on India's top IT exporter to report a quarter of strong revenue growth on Thursday, as the company continues to cement its position as the industry bellwether. Analysts are watching for commentary about growth prospects and discretionary spending, expected to be quite bullish as TCS has already said it would beat Nasscom's industry growth projections for this year. Here are five things to watch out for from TCS's second-quarter earnings:
Growth
Analysts expect the company to post around 8% growth quarter-over-quarter in dollar terms, with 3% of that coming from the company's acquisition in Japan. TCS has already said the quarter is tracking in line with its expectations. The first and second quarter typically post stronger growth for the company.
Margins and re-calibration
TCS is expected to post slightly-weaker margins as it absorbs and integrates its Japanese acquisition. The company has said it expects to maintain its margin within the range of 26-28% and analysts will be watching for signs of investment re-calibration to maintain that level.
Deal wins
As the mega deals signed ten years ago come up for renewal in 2014, the street will be keeping a close watch on the number of large deal wins - the bread and butter for IT companies. TCS has always maintained a razor -sharp focus on big contracts and has had greater success winning them.
Discretionary Spending Guidance
Discretionary spending is increasingly becoming a driving force for TCS' results. The company has said its digital business - which focuses on technologies such as analytics, cloud, mobile and social - is winning larger size contracts and should bring in a 'few billion dollars worth of revenue' in the next few years. Discretionary spending has returned at Infosys and the company expects this to power its digital business.
Attrition and utilization
The number of employees peaking typically peaks in the second quarter and analysts want to see how TCS performs, after Infosys said it was losing nearly a fifth of its workforce. TCS already has the lowest attrition rate in the industry.
Utilization will also be under the scanner. TCS has industry leading utilization levels, at about 85.3% and has in the past boosted utilization to improve its margin. Analysts will be keen to see how much higher the company can drive employee productivity. However, the company says that at its scale, it no longer makes sense for it to consider utilization in terms of percentages.

Indian-American in tough fight for Silicon V...Congressional District
(With US mid-term elections…)
NEW YORK: A prominent Indian-American lawyer, campaigning for a Congressional seat in the heart of the Silicon Valley, appears to be giving a tough fight to his contenders with support growing for his vision of strengthening the economy and fostering innovation.
With US mid-term elections just three weeks away, new poll numbers suggest that Ro Khanna is closing the gaps with his contenders and is currently tied with Representative Mike Honda of San Jose at 38 per cent, Khanna's campaign pollster found in a survey of 400 likely voters.
Of those polled 24 per cent were undecided. "These numbers are a clear sign that the more voters hear Ro's vision for strengthening our economy, fostering innovation, and ensuring our children are prepared for the jobs of the future, the more likely they are to vote for new leadership this November," Khanna's campaign manager Leah Cowan said in a report in the San Jose Mercury News.
The new numbers are a big turnaround from the 20-point lead that Honda held in June's primary vote.
Khanna, 37, has been mounting an "aggressive campaign" for the seat from the 17th Congressional District in the San Francisco Bay area, challenging and significantly outraising Honda, 72, who was first elected to Congress in 2000 and has the support of the rest of the Democratic establishment.
Khanna has received the backing of many of Silicon Valley's top investors and executives, including Yahoo's chief executive Marissa Mayer , Randi Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Zuckerberg Media and the sister of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg , Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen and venture capitalist John Doerr.
Silicon Valley venture capitalist and contributor to Khanna's campaign Karl Mehta said Honda used the power of his office to bolster his re-election bid.
Mehta in 2012 contributed $17,500 to President Obama's campaign and $7,500 to the Democratic National Committee, which could have led to his being flagged as a potential donor.
Mehta gave $2,600 to Khanna's campaign last year, after his invitations to the Honda events.
Khanna has authored 'Entrepreneurial Nation', a book on manufacturing and American competitiveness and was a deputy assistant commerce secretary from 2009 to 2011.
He now represents technology companies in intellectual property cases at one of Silicon Valley's most prestigious law firms.

TCS likely to report over 5% rise in net profitWhat should investors do with TCS ahead of Q2 results?

(TCS is expected to lead the…)
NEW DELHI: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is scheduled to declare its results for the quarter ended September 30 post market hours on Thursday, 16 October.
TCS is expected to lead the IT pack in terms of revenue growth and in bottom line growth. Analysts expect TCS to report a 5.4 per cent QoQ rise in net profit to Rs 5330 crore, aided mainly by higher margins.
"We expect Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) to outperform on revenue growth at 7 per cent QoQ and nearly touch US$4bn in quarterly revenue in 2QFY15 (US$3,954mn), led by volume growth," brokerage firm Karvy said in a report.
Result days are typically marred with volatility and the stock movement is also influenced by the event in the short-term and hence can move in either direction. But technically, one needs to create bets in the larger direction of the trend which is up in this counter, say analysts.
In the last 4 trading sessions the stock appears to have formed a short-term base and is consolidating around its 21-day exponential moving average of 2725 - 2670 as if traders are clueless about the result and waiting to create bets after verifying the result.
"Considering volatility on result day's and uptrend present in the scrip, best strategy would be to create long positions for initial target of Rs 2825 with a stop below Rs 2668 and along with it traders should also buy out of the money put option' as a protection so that if the result disappoints they can participate and make money on the down side," says Mazhar Mohammad, Technical Research Strategist, Chartviewindia.in.
"Besides, this scrip has stiff resistance at 2840 on longer term charts. If it registers a breakout above this level another 5-10% up move can't be ruled out," he adds.
If history is anything to go by then it is clear that the stock trades with the negative bias on the day of result, but gives a strong rally the next day.
In its last quarter results, that is for April- June 2014 period it reported higher than expected dollar revenue at USD 3694 million which was up by 5.5 per cent compared to USD 3503 million in previous quarter (January - March 2014).
"The stock moves up after the decent correction on or before the quarterly result day. If we see stock movement on 17th July 2014, when 1st quarter results for the FY 14-15 was declared, it ended the day with the marginal loss and displayed a good upside rally from the next day," says Rohit Gadia, Founder & CEO, CapitalVia Global Research Ltd.
"Technically, the stock is bullish and after registering lifetime high of 2839.70 on 7th October 2014, it is showing correction on charts," says Gadia.
Currently, the stock is trading above its 50 and 200-DMA with the RSI of 54.52. Immediate support for the stock is at Rs 2632, while major support is at Rs 2430. In near term, if stock crosses its next resistance level of 2740 then it can test the life time high again, say analysts.
We have collated list of strategies from different analysts which can be deployed by investors ahead of TCS Q2 results:
Rohit Gadia, Founder & CEO, CapitalVia Global Research Ltd
One can trade in option to minimize the risk ahead of the result. Traders can take long position in the October 2750 call option above the level of 70, where they can keep target of 110 with the stop loss of 40.
If stock sustains above the level of 2630 then with the crossing of its resistance level of 2740,a rally of another 130-150 points can be seen, one should remain invested in the stock and can book partial profit in it.
Tushar Pendharkar, Equity Strategist-Right Horizons Financial Services
Overall TCS is trading in strong uptrend and trading above resistance zone so it would be advisable to hold the stock and profit booking in case of up move towards 3250.
  Normally, TCS lead the IT stocks rally with better performance and future outlook, but this time IT sector is underperforming the market. It would be advisable to buy in case of any downside towards 2400 and existing investor can hold it and partially profit booking as per resistance level of 3250.
Gaurav S. Ratnaparkhi, Technical Analyst at Sharekhan
In case of TCS, medium-term as well as long-term trend is bullish. However, the multi month rally seems to have matured from short term perspective.
The stock in the week gone by formed a Bearish Outside Bar pattern on the weekly chart. The bearish formation has taken place at the weekly upper Bollinger Band, which increases the bearish significance.
On a lower time frame TCS has formed a Bearish Flag pattern. Short term momentum indicators are in line with these bearish developments.
Thus trading strategy for TCS would be to sell at current level with stoploss of 2805 for targets of 2550 - 2500 (The levels mentioned are cash levels).

SAN FRANCISCO: Google has unveiled its latest tablet in an apparent effort to upstage Apple's anticipated update of its trend-setting iPad.
The Nexus 9 tablet announced Wednesday will compete against a new version of the iPad Air that Apple Inc. is expected to show off to reporters and analysts at a Thursday event in Cupertino, California.
Besides taking the wraps off its new tablet, Google Inc. also rolled out its latest Nexus smartphone. The Nexus 6 phone has a nearly 6-inch screen, eclipsing the 5.5-inch display on the iPhone 6 Plus that Apple began selling last month.
Both of the Nexus devices will run on a new version of Google's Android operating system. The latest software is called ``Lollipop'' in keeping with Google's tradition of naming its Android upgrades after treats.

Who s afraid of the WTO Calling the US bluffOctober 15, 2014, 11:05 pm IST Dev Nathan in Creative Destruction | Business , Companies | ET

One way of trying to prevent late industrializers catching up is to use intellectual property (IP) or patent protection laws to prevent reverse engineering, meaning discovering the concepts involved in manufacture to produce something similar. This is a policy that Ha Joon Chang labeled ‘pulling up the ladder’. But despite US efforts the WTO patent regime still has some flexibility to allow the development and marketing of generic drugs, a flexibility that continues to be used by the Indian pharmaceutical industry.
The WTO’s Doha Declaration of 2002 allowed the export of generic drugs for treating communicable diseases. This enabled low-income countries, particularly in Africa, to benefit from Indian development of generic anti-retroviral AIDS drugs was the issue. The WTO’s TRIPS agreement itself has provisions to prevent ‘ever-greening’ or the use of minor changes to extend patent life beyond the allowable 20 years. Further, there is also a compulsory license provision in the case of drugs not being made available at a ‘reasonable price’ and in sufficient quantities. Both of these provisions have been recently used with respect to Bayer’s anti-cancer drug, Nexavar, and the Novartis anti-cancer drug, Gleevec.
The major US pharmaceutical companies or Big Pharma, obviously try to use the US government to pressurize other governments to continue to give them exclusive rights to market their high-priced drugs, which often are commercial products of publicly-funded research.
The question that arises is: why does the US not take India to the WTO Court for violation of patent protection? The reason for this is quite simple: Indian actions, on compulsory license or prevention of ever-greening attempts, are not in violation of the WTO’s TRIPS rules. A judgment at the WTO Court, which will certainly go against the US, will damage Big Pharma’s position in all world markets. This is the reason why the US tries to use the bilateral route, where there can be arm-twisting of different types. Such bilateral measures have been successful against Thailand and Brazil and will certainly be raised in the recent US-Indo business committee set up during Modi’s visit to the US.
While Big Pharma continues to protect its high-priced markets, some other US companies seem to have realized that they cannot keep pushing against the tide of generics. The smaller US company, Gilead Sciences, has entered into an agreement with Indian companies to sell generic versions of its hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi.
With likely sales of $10 billion in 2014 it will be one of the new ‘blockbuster’ drugs. But at $1,000 a pill it is out of reach of most of the 180 million infected with hepatitis C, who live in middle and low-income countries. The generic versions, produced by Gilead or the Indian companies, will be around $1 per pill.
In the AIDS scandal, Big Pharma protested all the way in trying to protect its monopoly profits. This time around, in the case of hepatitis C, which is said to cause the death of 350,000 people a year, the agreement to introduce generics, very soon after the high-priced version, is a blow for a more moral, non-commodity, approach to medical treatment.

US stocks: Fear rises as Dow Jones drops 400 points(The tech-heavy index was…)
Fear is spreading in the stock market.
A monthlong drop in US stocks intensified in afternoon trading Wednesday, sending the Dow Jones industrial average down more than 400 points and putting the index on track for its biggest loss in more than a year.
The decline came as investor fears of a global economic slowdown deepened after several weeks of turbulent market action. Worrisome economic news in the U.S. also fueled Wednesday's selling.
Traders dumped risky assets and parked their money in investments seen as relatively safe, such as U.S. government bonds. That pushed the yield on the 10-year Treasury note briefly below 2 percent, the lowest level in more than a year.
``It's a function of the U.S. being the best house in a bad neighborhood,'' said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. ``There's still uncertainty about economic growth, primarily on a global basis.''
Stocks plunged at the open of trading and extended a rough October for the market.
The Dow was down 339 points, or 2.1 percent, to 15,976 as of 2:27 p.m. Eastern time. It dropped as much as 460 points earlier and was headed for its biggest percentage drop since June 2013.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 39 points, or 2.1 percent, to 1,838. The Nasdaq composite dropped 73 points, or 1.7 percent, to 4,155.
All three indexes are now down for the year.
Until late September, the market had moved higher for most of 2014 as U.S. corporate earnings kept up record growth and the economy strengthened.
Stocks, though, have been declining for nearly a month as investors have grown increasingly nervous about slowing global growth. While the U.S. economy remains healthy, investors are concerned that earnings growth will fade this year and next because of the slowdown in Europe and, to a lesser degree, China.
Wednesday's slide brings the stock market closer to a correction. That happens when a benchmark index like the S&P 500 falls 10 percent or more from a recent peak.
The S&P 500 hit its most recent peak of 2,011.36 on Sept. 18. It would have to close at 1,810.22 to mark a correction. The last time that happened was October 2011.
The correction threshold for the Dow is 15,551. The Nasdaq's is 4,138. The Nasdaq traded below that threshold on Wednesday and could match the widely accepted definition of being in a correction if it closes below that point.
Parts of the market are already in correction, which has some analysts calling for caution. Small-company stocks, as measured by the Russell 2000 index, have fallen 12.8 percent since hitting a peak in July and are down 9.5 percent for the year.
Many market watchers say occasional corrections are a healthy phenomenon over the long term and give investors an opportunity to add to their holdings at a lower cost.
``That's why it' so important to stay invested at a time like this, rather than think it's a time to get out,'' said Kate Warne, an investment strategist at Edward Jones.
Bond prices soared Wednesday as investors shifted money into safe-haven investments.
Early on, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note plunged to 1.91 percent from 2.20 percent the day before, or 29 basis points, a huge move. It recovered to 2.06 percent in afternoon trading. Bond yields fall when their prices rise.
``It typically takes weeks for 10-year Treasurys to move 29 basis points,'' noted Tom Di Galoma, head of fixed income rates in New York at ED&F Man Capital. ``Today it moved 29 basis points in 5 minutes.''
Investors got discouraging U.S. economic news early Wednesday, when the Commerce Department reported that retail sales declined 0.3 percent in September from the previous month. Purchases of autos, gasoline, furniture and clothing slowed.
Retail sales have risen 4.3 percent over the past 12 months, slightly below their historical pace.
A snapshot of manufacturing activity didn't bolster optimism.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Empire State Manufacturing index dropped sharply from 27.5 to 6.2 in October as new orders shrank and shipments barely rose. The latest reading marks the slowest pace of growth in six months.
All 10 sectors in the S&P 500 declined, led by financial stocks, which slid 3.3 percent.
KeyCorp, Hudson City Bancorp, Lincoln National and Citigroup were among the biggest decliners. Covidien led the slide among S&P 500 companies, falling $7.89, or 8.5 percent, to $84.46.
Bucking the trend were several energy and oil services companies, including Cabot Oil & Gas, Southwest Energy and Helmerich & Payne. Southwestern paced the gainers, rising $2.02, or 6.1 percent, to $35.12.
Homebuilders surged, getting a lift from the slide in the 10-year Treasury bond yield, which affects rate on consumer and business loans. A decline in the 10-year Treasury note yield should nudge mortgage rates lower, spurring home sales.
M/I Homes got the biggest boost among the builders, adding 77 cents, or 4 percent, to $19.99.
As more companies report earnings over the next couple of weeks, investors should get a better read of the impact that the economic situation overseas will have on U.S. companies.
In overseas market action, traders worried that Europe might relapse into recession.
France's CAC 40 sank 3.6 percent and Germany's DAX lost 2.9 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 fell 2.8 percent. Greece's stock index plunged 6.3 percent on concerns that the Greek government could collapse next year, putting its bailout program in danger. The index fell 5.7 percent the previous day.
U.S. crude slipped 23 cents to $81.61 a barrel.
In metals trading, gold rose $10.50 to $1,244.80 an ounce, silver rose six cents to $17.46 an ounce and copper fell eight cents to $3.01 a pound.

Google unveils  Lollipop  Android system  new devicesGoogle unveils 'Lollipop' Android system, new devices
By AFP | 16 Oct, 2014, 12.39AM IST
Google also announced launch of a streaming media player for music, movies & videos, which can also allow users to play games via Android TV device.

WASHINGTON: Google on Wednesday ramped up its mobile arsenal, upgrading its Nexus line with a new tablet and smartphone, and unveiling its revamped Android software, to be dubbed "Lollipop."
The US tech giant also announced the launch of a streaming media player for music, movies and videos, which can also allow users to play games via the Android TV device.
"Lollipop" or Android 5.0, the upgraded operating system for mobile, "is designed to be flexible, to work on all your devices and to be customized for you the way you see fit," said Google vice president Sundar Pichai , who heads the Android operations.
With the new operating system, according to the Android Website, "The songs, photos, apps, and even recent searches from one of your Android devices can be immediately enjoyed across all of your Android devices."
The new devices give Google and its Android partners a broader portfolio to compete against Apple , which launched two upgraded large-screen iPhones last month and is expected to unveil new iPads on Thursday.
The Nexus 6 smartphone becomes the newest and largest of the Google-branded handsets, and is produced by Motorola , which Google bought in 2012 and is in the process of selling to China's Lenovo.
This aluminum frame device has a six-inch high resolution screen and a 13-megapixel camera.
"The large screen is complemented by dual front-facing stereo speakers that deliver high-fidelity sound, making it as great for movies and gaming as it is for doing work," Google said in a statement.
"It also comes with a Turbo Charger, so you can get up to six hours of use with only 15 minutes of charge."
On the tablet front, Google partnered with Taiwan-based HTC for the 8.9-inch Nexus 9.
The brushed-metal tablet "is small enough to easily carry around in one hand, yet big enough to work on," Google said.
"And since more and more people want to have the same simple experience they have on their tablets when they have to do real work, we designed a keyboard folio that magnetically attaches to the Nexus 9, folds into two different angles and rests securely on your lap like a laptop."
Google did not disclose pricing for the devices, but said they would be available for pre-order later this month.
The media player will deliver video apps to a television screen for consumers looking to supplement or go without cable or satellite.
Some of the apps included on the player are Netflix , Hulu Plus , the Food Network , Pandora and The Huffington Post.

IndiGo s Diwali splurge: Company to buy 250 Airbus A320neo aircraftComments
India’s largest domestic airline IndiGo will buy 250 Airbus A320neo planes — the single biggest order of jets from the European planemaker — seeking to widen its lead over rivals burdened with big loans and heavy losses.
IndiGo’s third major purchase in nine years is worth about $25 billion (Rs 1.52 lakh crore), approximately five times the annual budget of the rural job guarantee scheme the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. It will start taking delivery of the planes from 2018.
“The additional aircraft will enable us to continue to bring our low fares and courteous, hassle-free service to more customers and markets and will create more job opportunities and growth,” Aditya Ghosh, president, IndiGo, said.
The budget airline, which has a fleet of 83 A320 aircraft operating 540 daily flights across 36 destinations, had ordered 100 Airbus aircraft in 2005 and another 180 in 2011.
Preparing for an initial public offering, Indigo is learnt to have reported its sixth straight annual profit in 2013-14.
The closely held company, co-founded by Rakesh Gangwal and Rahul Bhatia, recorded a net profit of Rs. 317 crore in 2013-14, 60% lower than its previous year’s Rs. 787 crore, hit by a falling rupee and high jet fuel costs.
Launched in 2006, Indigo is the only profitable airline in the country and commands nearly a third of the domestic aviation market.
Naresh Goyal-promoted Jet Airways logged a seventh straight annual loss of Rs. 3,667 crore in 2013-14, while Kalanithi Maran-controlled SpiceJet, another listed carrier, posted its biggest ever net loss of Rs. 1,003.24 crore the same year.
State-owned Air India’s accumulated losses exceed Rs. 30,000 crore.
In an interview to Mint, Ghosh said “these planes will help us to plan a long-term and sustainable future for our company”.
Mint is a business paper published by HT Media Limited, which also brings out Hindustan Times.
“Primarily, this would be used for our own operations. Of course, some will be used for replacement, but largely, these planes would be used to penetrate under-utilised Indian civil aviation market,” Ghosh said.
Indigo, on an average, takes planes older than six years off the fleet.
The company will fund its latest purchase by bank debt and sale and leaseback— a system in which an owner sells an asset to a leasing firm and, at the same time, leases it back on a long-term basis to retain exclusive possession and use.
This prevents capital from being locked up.

Crude at 47-month low  good news for economyGlobal crude oil prices fell to a four-year low of $84 a barrel on Wednesday, raising prospects of further cuts in retail fuel prices besides bolstering the government’s plans to tame inflation and cut subsidies.
India imports two-thirds of its energy needs, making oil prices a key factor for inflation.
On Tuesday, oil companies cut petrol prices by Rs. 1 a litre and a cut in diesel rates — the first in over five years — is expected in the next few days. Lower diesel prices will cut down cost of ferrying goods and help keep inflation low and stable.
India’s wholesale inflation rate plunged to 2.38% in September, the lowest in five years, while retail inflation fell to 6.46%, the lowest since 2012, aided by a sharp drop in vegetable and petrol prices, rekindling hopes that the RBI will cut interest rates soon and prompt banks to lower home loan EMIs.
Besides, softer crude prices will help curtail fuel subsidies and contain the fiscal deficit — a measure of the amount the government borrows to fund its expenses — at the budgeted level of 4.1% of the GDP in 2014-15.
The fiscal deficit target was set on the assumption of an average crude oil price of $105 a barrel, more than $20 a barrel than the current price.
With every dollar decrease in oil prices, the government’s oil import bill comes down by Rs. 4,000 crore. 
A $2-4-per-barrel reduction in crude prices on average would mean the lowering of India’s oil import bill by Rs. 8,000 crore to Rs. 16,000 crore.
India, the world’s fourth-largest oil consumer, imports around 190 million tonnes of crude oil a year at a cost of $145 billion, or more than a third of its total import bill.

DLF may have to sell crown jewels to surviveDLF may have to sell crown jewels to survive

At a time when the realty market is in a sluggish patch, Monday’s ruling by market regulator Sebi restraining DLF from raising funds for three years could force the realty major to cut prices or offer flexible payment options to actively woo buyers, analysts said.
DLF is the dominant player, and its approach dictates the market trend. “If it ends up selling land and development projects and ongoing projects at a discounted rate, it will have an impact on the overall real estate-market sentiment,” said a real estate consultant, who did not wish to be identified.
The non-resident Indian market may also see a decline of around 5-10%.
Smaller developers may face the brunt as cash flows are stretched. The real estate market as a whole, including DLF, has been witnessing low sales in the residential segment. For DLF the sales were 25% down in the April-June quarter at Rs. 1,725 crore, against Rs. 2,314 crore a year ago.
Many brokers in the NCR market said they had been hoping the festive season would improve the market sentiment, but Sebi’s ruling has come as a blow. DLF commands nearly 60% market share in the Millennium City, Gurgaon.
Over the last few years the company has sold the luxury hotel chain Aman resorts,  sold off 17 acres of prime land in Mumbai to Lodha Developers and exited its wind energy projects in Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan.
If it now decides to raise capital by launching new projects in its existing land parcels in Delhi-NCR, it still has the option of raising money through the private equity route.
It may also try and take the FSI (floor space index) route and join hands with another developer, rather than sell its land in NCR, said a real estate expert on the condition of anonymity.
The company might also need to dig deep into its commercial properties put out on rent, analysts said.
“The saving grace in its portfolio are assets that earn annual rentals of more than Rs. 2,100 crore. It can always — in the worst case scenario — sell these income-producing assets to generate more than Rs. 20,000 crore, which is equal to their total debt,” said another consultant.
DLF has about 21 million sq ft of leased assets across the country.

Five Indian companies — Wipro, Essar Oil, Tech Mahindra, Larsen and Toubro and Tata Consultancy Services — are among the top global companies that did business in the most sustainable manner in 2013, the Carbon Disclosure Report (CDR) 2014 said on Wednesday.
The ranking is of the top 2,000 companies on the request of 767 investors who represent more than a third of the world’s invested capital. The companies are analysed on the basis of voluntary disclosure. About 200 Indian companies participated in the study.
 “In terms of global ranking, it is impressive that five Indian companies have made it to the Global A-list, on par with Australia and Canada and more than any other emerging economy, except South Africa,” said a statement issued by CDR India.
A similar report for India showed that energy efficiency was a key mean for the companies to check their carbon emissions. Over 60% of the surveyed companies are introducing process energy efficiency initiatives, consequently 24% have reduced their absolute emissions and an additional 26% have reduced their emissions intensity while driving business growth and profitability.
“The report demonstrates a strong level of commitment by Indian companies towards greater energy efficiency as a means of addressing climate change. It also highlights the need for enabling a strong regulatory environment that attract higher levels of investments,” said Damandeep Singh, director, CDP India.

Freeze your eggs  Apple tells female employeesFreeze your eggs, Apple tells female employees
Yashwant Raj , Hindustan Times  Washington, October 16, 2014

Facebook and Apple have a new perk for their female employees: an offer to pay for freezing their eggs, to delay parenting and stay focussed on their careers.
NBC News reported that Facebook began offering this perk in January and Apple plans to start middle of 2015, joining an emerging trend across industries and other sectors.
The option of freezing her eggs when she is most fertile helps a women extend fertility and delay motherhood — which tends to put their careers on hold — a professional setback not equally encumbering men.
“For the young professional who wants to delay starting a family or the single woman who simply hasn’t yet found Mr Right, egg freezing may be a viable option,” said Fahimeh Sasan of Eggbanxx, a chain of eggs freezing clinics, on company website.
“Having a high-powered career and children is still a very hard thing to do,” Brigitte Adams, an egg-freezing advocate and founder of the patient forum Eggsurance.com, told NBC.
The procedure, however, is neither perfect nor cheap. Not all frozen eggs lead to successful pregnancy — the younger the donor, the better are the chances.
Oocyte cryopreservation, as the process is known technically, prolongs a woman’s chances of conceiving even later in life, using the eggs stored from when they
were younger.
“Since fertility dramatically decreases after age 35, egg freezing acts as ‘fertility insurance’ and preserves the viability of the egg,” said Fahimeh Sasan of Eggbanxx, a chain of eggs freezing clinics, on company Website.
But the process is not cheap and increases by up to $10,000 for every round (5 to 15 eggs are retrieved every round. Experts believe at least 20 are needed for one pregnancy). Storage can cost $500 or more a year.
Both Apple and Facebook are giving coverage of up to $20,000.

Pistorius  blood money  row: Defence team revelation shocks Steenkamp lawyersDefence team revelation shocks Steenkamp lawyers
AFP
Lawyers for Reeva Steenkamp's family expressed shock on Wednesday that Oscar Pistorius's defence team revealed details of secret "blood money" payments during a heated courtroom arguments over his sentencing.
 
In a statement on behalf of the slain model's parents, lawyers said they had "honoured" a request from the athlete not to reveal payments of $540 made each month after Pistorius killed her on Valentine's Day 2013.
 
"We were therefore quite surprised yesterday when this fact was disclosed in court without any prior warning to us," the statement said.
 
During a sentencing hearing on Tuesday, a defence witness referred to the payments as evidence that Pistorius was remorseful about shooting his 29-year-old girlfriend four times through a bathroom door, believing she was an intruder.
 
The revelation prompted angry suggestions that Pistorius's team had opportunistically revealed the payments to reduce his likelihood of going to jail.
 
The Paralympian star athlete was found guilty last month of unlawfully killing Steenkamp but acquitted of the more serious charge of murder.
 
Judge Thokozile Masipa could rule on his punishment as early as Friday, with her options ranging from a fine to 15 years in prison.
 
Claims about Pistorius's vulnerability and remorse could be central in deciding which way the scales of justice tip.
 
The defence has suggested Pistorius clean a museum for 16 hours a week as punishment for killing Steenkamp, drawing a furious reaction from the state.
 
Prosecutor Gerrie Nel described the suggestion as "shockingly inappropriate".
 
On Tuesday, a visibly irate Nel told the court that the Olympian also offered the dead model's family a one off "blood money" payment of nearly $35,000, which the family rejected.
 
"Did the legal team of the accused tell you that the deceased family rejected the offer of 375,000 (rand)?" Nel asked witness, probation officer Annette Vergeer.
 
Stenekamp's parents have said they will repay the roughly $10,000 received from Pistorius "as soon as arrangements can be made in that regard".
 
"It was always the intention of the parents that the amounts... would be set-off against any civil claim that they were going to institute," the statement said.
 
The parents have now decided not to continue with a civil claim.
 
The sentencing hearing continued today with Vergeer being cross-examined by the prosecution.
 
She had warned that a jail stretch would "break" Pistorius and claimed it was not in the interest of justice.

BJP front runner in Haryana  Maharashtra  say exit pollsComments
At least three exit polls put the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead but short of a clear majority in Maharashtra and Haryana on Wednesday, a ringing endorsement of the so-called 'Modi magic' that may have helped the party come into its own in the two politically crucial states.

A fourth survey by Today's Chanakya, which correctly predicted the results of the Lok Sabha polls this year, gave the party a clear majority in both states.
The projections, if true, could touch off a round of intense haggling between the party and its estranged allies - the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra and Haryana Janhit Congress (HJC) - for control of the two states that the Congress has led for more than a decade, either on its own or with its partners.
Read: Poll trends set off early Diwali for BJP
A BJP victory will reaffirm Modi's appeal among voters and silence detractors of his new party leadership, which was blamed for a string of defeats in recent by-elections that tempered the euphoria of his Lok Sabha triumph.
Modi campaigned extensively for the state elections, addressing 27 rallies in Maharashtra and 11 in Haryana in a bid to prop up the BJP's fortunes after the by-election losses.
A Times Now-C Voter poll predicted the BJP would bag 129 of 288 seats in the politically crucial state of Maharashtra despite the falling apart of its 25-year-old association with the Shiv Sena, which was projected to win in 56 constituencies. Times Now-C Voter predicted 37 seats for the BJP in the 90-member Haryana assembly.
An ABP-Nielsen poll predicted 144 seats for the BJP and 77 for the Sena, while an India Today-Cicero exit poll saw the BJP winning 124 seats in Maharashtra. The poll says the Shiv Sena will be the second largest gainer in Maharashtra with 71 seats.
The polls did not bring any cheer to the Congress party, already relegated to the political sidelines since its bruising defeat in the Lok Sabha polls.
The Times Now-C Voter poll said the Congress was likely to win 43 seats in Maharashtra while ABP-Nielsen said it will bag just 30 seats. In Haryana, Times Now-C Voter gave the Congress 15 seats and ABP-Nielsen poll predicted the country's main opposition party will get 10 seats.
Today's Chanakya predicted a clear majority of 151 seats for the BJP in Maharashtra and 52 in Haryana. Today's Chanakya was on the money when it predicted a 300-plus sweep for the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the Lok Sabha elections.
For the Congress, a poor result will possibly stoke further murmurs against Rahul Gandhi's leadership.
If the outcome on Sunday's judgement day matches the predictions, it would mean the Congress would have to carry forward with its restructuring process to script a turnaround in the face of a saffron surge.
Haryana saw a high turnout of 75.9%, while Maharashtra registered a turnout of  63.4% in the elections seen as a test of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popularity since he stormed to power in May and the BJP's strategy to abandon long-standing allies in the states.
The elections were mainly peaceful except for minor clashes between workers of the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), BJP and others in Haryana.
Analysts said the BJP had benefited from anger towards the Congress party, which has held power in Maharashtra for 15 years and Haryana for a decade. Both chief ministers, Prithviraj Chavan in Maharashtra and Bhupinder Hooda in Haryana, battled strong anti-incumbency with corruption being a major poll issue.
Read: Nearly 64% vote in Maharashtra, highest-ever 76% turnout in Haryana
The BJP took a big gamble on its popularity and campaigned alone in both states.
It was in contention for power for the first time in Haryana, where it was a junior partner in the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) government in 2000. Similarly in Maharashtra, the BJP had so far played second fiddle to the Shiv Sena, which led the coalition government in the state from 1995 to 1999. The Congress-NCP alliance ruled the state for 15 years from 1999.
In case of a hung verdict, the shaping up of new political alliances promises to be another interesting chapter following the high-stakes elections.

Google on Wednesday ramped up its mobile arsenal, upgrading its Nexus line with a new tablet and smartphone, and unveiling its revamped Android software, to be dubbed "Lollipop."
The US tech giant also announced the launch of a streaming media player for music, movies and videos, which can also allow users to play games via the Android TV device.
"Lollipop" or Android 5.0, the upgraded operating system for mobile, "is designed to be flexible, to work on all your devices and to be customized for you the way you see fit," said Google vice president Sundar Pichai, who heads the Android operations.
With the new operating system, according to the Android Website, "The songs, photos, apps, and even recent searches from one of your Android devices can be immediately enjoyed across all of your Android devices."

The new devices give Google and its Android partners a broader portfolio to compete against Apple, which launched two upgraded large-screen iPhones last month and is expected to unveil new iPads on Thursday.
The Nexus 6 smartphone becomes the newest and largest of the Google-branded handsets, and is produced by Motorola, which Google bought in 2012 and is in the process of selling to China's Lenovo.
This aluminum frame device has a six-inch high resolution screen and a 13-megapixel camera.
"The large screen is complemented by dual front-facing stereo speakers that deliver high-fidelity sound, making it as great for movies and gaming as it is for doing work," Google said in a statement.
"It also comes with a Turbo Charger, so you can get up to six hours of use with only 15 minutes of charge."
On the tablet front, Google partnered with Taiwan-based HTC for the 8.9-inch Nexus 9.
The brushed-metal tablet "is small enough to easily carry around in one hand, yet big enough to work on," Google said.
"And since more and more people want to have the same simple experience they have on their tablets when they have to do real work, we designed a keyboard folio that magnetically attaches to the Nexus 9, folds into two different angles and rests securely on your lap like a laptop."
Google did not disclose pricing for the devices, but said they would be available for pre-order later this month.
The media player will deliver video apps to a television screen for consumers looking to supplement or go without cable or satellite.
Some of the apps included on the player are Netflix, Hulu Plus, the Food Network, Pandora and The Huffington Post.

India has until October 21 to back global customs deal: EU ministerIndia in July blocked what would have been the first global trade reform in two decades, which according to some estimates would add $1 trillion to the world economy.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
ROME: India has until next Tuesday to support a global trade deal struck last year or risk being left out of the agreement to ease worldwide customs rules, the chairman of EU trade ministers said on Wednesday.
India in July blocked what would have been the first global trade reform in two decades, which according to some estimates would add $1 trillion and 21 million jobs to the world economy .
"India is not following up what we have all decided in Bali. So we still want to give more time to change its mind," Italy's deputy industry minister Carlo Calenda , who is responsible for trade, told Reuters in an interview.
Calenda was speaking at the end of a meeting of EU trade ministers in Rome, which he was chairing as Italy currently holds the six-month rotating presidency of the European Union.
Calenda said India was being given until the meeting of the World Trade Organisation's general council on Oct. 21 to back the customs deal. Failure to do so would mean one of two things.
"One is to start again with multilateral discussions but not many countries are willing to do that, the other is to say let's consider this binding for those that have the willingness to go ahead," Calenda said, making clear that the latter was far more likely to occur.
Last December's agreement was a milestone for the WTO , marking the 160-member organisation's first global trade agreement since it was created in 1995.
It also rekindled confidence in its ability to lower barriers to trade worldwide, after 12 years of fruitless negotiations in the Doha round.
India had insisted that, in exchange for signing the "trade facilitation" agreement, it must see more progress on a parallel pact giving it more freedom to subsidise and stockpile food grains. It got support from Cuba, Venezuela and Bolivia.
India's new nationalist government has insisted that a permanent agreement on its subsidised food stockpiling must be in place at the same time as the trade facilitation deal, well ahead of a 2017 target set last December in Bali.
"There is a scenario where the multilateral becomes pluri-lateral and that is not going to be a positive thing," Calenda said.
That could mean countries including the United States, those of the European Union , Australia, Japan and Norway pushing ahead with a deal among the willing.
Trade experts have said that the failure is likely to end the era of trying to cobble together global trade agreements and to accelerate efforts by smaller groups of like-minded nations to liberalise trade among themselves. India has been vocal in opposing such moves, making its veto even more surprising.

Ebola  most serious  health emergency in ye...The Ebola epidemic is "the most serious international public health emergency in recent years," British, US, French, German and Italian leaders agreed in a conference call on Wednesday.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
LONDON: The Ebola epidemic is "the most serious international public health emergency in recent years," British, US, French, German and Italian leaders agreed in a conference call on Wednesday.
A 75-minute video conference call between British Prime Minister David Cameron , French President Francois Hollande , German Chancellor Angela Merkel , Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and US President Barack Obama focused on cooperation to fight the outbreak, a spokesman for Cameron said.
"Leaders agreed that this was the most serious international public health emergency in recent years and that the international community needed to do much more and faster to halt the rise of the disease in the region," the prime minister's office said in a statement.
"Each leader set out what they are doing to help the countries affected and then discussions focused on how to improve coordination of the international effort."
Cameron proposed that plans to tackle the disease could be decided at a Friday summit in Milan between European and Asian leaders and a European Council meeting next week.
The call comes after reports that a second healthcare worker in Texas in the United States tested positive for Ebola after caring for a Liberian patient who died of the virus in Dallas.
The United Nations also warned Ebola was outpacing efforts to combat the disease and said the world should dramatically expand the fight against the tropical fever, which has killed nearly 4,500 people this year, mainly in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.
Cameron said that he would welcome any other countries who wanted to contribute to British efforts to fight the disease in Sierra Leone, and would discuss cooperation with Italy.
The discussion identified priorities of improving coordination of international efforts, increasing spending and trained personnel working the region affected, and evacuation procedures for workers infected with the disease.
The leaders also discussed the fight against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria and peace efforts in Ukraine.
The leaders said "the international coalition was making progress" in Iraq, but that more should be done to train local forces in Iraq and Syria to fight the group.
On the topic of Ukraine , the leaders agreed that Russia should respect a ceasefire and stop a cross-border flow of weapons and come to an energy supply agreement in Ukraine.
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian leader Petro Poroshenko are to meet in Milan on Friday to try to settle a disagreement over gas supplies and broker an end to months of conflict in east Ukraine.

US Federal Reserve survey finds moderate growth nationwide

Beige Book
(The report said price pressures…)
WASHINGTON: The US economy was strengthening in most regions of the country in September to early October, helped by gains in consumer spending, manufacturing and commercial construction, according to the Federal Reserve's latest survey of business conditions.
The Fed report released Wednesday said six of its 12 regions, Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas and San Francisco, reported ``moderate'' growth. Five others described growth as ``modest,'' and one, Boston, described activity as mixed.
The report depicted an economy moving ahead steadily but not at a pace that would prompt the Fed to accelerate its timetable for raising interest rates. The survey, known as the Beige Book , is based on anecdotal reports from businesses and will be considered with other data when Fed policymakers meet Oct. 28-29.
The Fed's benchmark rate has been near zero since December 2008 as the central bank worked to boost the economy and lower unemployment following the Great Recession. Many economists believe the Fed's first rate hike will not occur until around June of next year and that any increases will be gradual.
In its latest Beige Book, the Fed reported that manufacturing was increasing in most districts. In the New York region, however, manufacturing growth stalled, and Boston reported weaker results than in the past few reports.
Three districts, Cleveland, Chicago and San Francisco, reported stronger demand for steel, while Richmond and San Francisco noted strong demand for medical equipment.
Reports on residential construction and real estate activity were mixed. In New York, single-family home construction was lackluster, but multifamily home construction expanded. In Chicago, home construction grew, while home sales slowed somewhat.
The report said price pressures remained subdued, with districts finding little to no change in price levels or only modest increases.
Employment continued to expand at about the same pace as the previous reporting period. Some employers reported difficulties finding qualified workers in some industries. As a result, some districts said there was pressure to raise wages for skilled labor in areas such as construction and manufacturing.

Less than a month after successfully landing its maiden spacecraft to Mars, India launched its third navigational satellite IRNSS-IC on board PSLV-C26 from Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh in the early hours of Thursday.
Originally the satellite was to be launched on October 10 but was put off because of a technical snag in the telemetry system.
Thursday's launch used the PSLV-XL configuration the most powerful version of PSLV currently flying.  Science and technology minister Dr Jitendra Singh was present during the launch.

"Satellite navigation is a domain which is constantly evolving. Our Indian  Regional Navigation Satellite System will be a regional system, dedicated for usage in Indian main land and 1500 km around. Initially it would be  a constellation of seven satellites at an altitude of 36,000 km, distributed in geostationary and inclined orbits. The accuracy is expected to be 10-20 meters depending on the application," Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) chairman  Dr  K Radhakrishnan told HT before the launch.
Satellite navigation has manifold applications, he said, adding: “It has wide applications in  maritime, aviations, automobiles. It also finds applications in surveying,  mapping, archaeology etc. It is also useful for disaster management operations  and tracking services."
Bearing  similarity  to that of America’s Global Positioning System (GPS), the Indian satellite is supposed to transmit data continuously that will allow correctly equipped receivers to establish their location with considerable precision. 
The requirement of such a navigation system is driven by the fact that access to Global Navigation Satellite Systems is not guaranteed in hostile situations. The IRNSS would provide two services: the Standard Positioning Service is open for all the users and the Restricted Service for authorised users.

IRNSS comprises a space segment and a ground segment. The IRNSS space segment consists of seven satellites with three satellites in geostationary orbit and four in inclined geosynchronous orbit.
IRNSS ground segment is responsible for navigation parameter generation and transmission, satellite control.
IRNSS-1B  was launched  in April this year. Its predecessor IRNSS-1A was launched in July 2013. IRNSS IA and IRNSS IB have already started  from their designated orbital  slot  after extensive  on orbit test  and evaluation to confirm their satisfactory performance.

In a unanimously adopted statement, the 15-member body warned that the world's response "has failed to date".
Cameron said that he would welcome any other countries who wanted to contribute to British efforts to fight the disease in Sierra Leone, and would discuss cooperation with Italy.

Ebola death toll close to 4,500: WHO 
Almost 4,500 people have died in the Ebola epidemic that broke out in west Africa at the start of the year, according to fresh figures released Wednesday the World Health Organization.
The WHO said that as of October 12, 4,493 people have died from Ebola out of a total of 8,997 registered cases in seven countries.
The last official WHO toll, valid to October 8, put the figures at 4,033 dead from 8,399 cases. The seven countries are split into two groups by WHO. The first includes Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- by far the worst-affected nations.
The second includes Nigeria, Senegal, Spain and United States, which have seen a small number of highly isolated cases. Liberia has been hardest-hit, with 4,249 cases and 2,458 deaths, followed by Sierra Leone with 3,252 cases and 1,183 deaths. Guinea, where the epidemic originated in December, has seen 1,472 cases and 843 deaths.
Health workers continue to pay a heavy price as they battle the epidemic, with 236 deaths out of 427 cases across the countries. A total of 96 health workers have died in Liberia, 95 in Sierra Leone, 40 in Guinea, and five in Nigeria. Nigeria's overall toll remained unchanged at eight dead from 20 cases.
WHO has said it will be declared Ebola-free on October 20 if it has no further cases. In the United States there have been two cases, one of them fatal. Spain has one case of infection.
The toll remained unchanged in Senegal with one case. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, hit by a separate strain of Ebola from the one raging in west Africa, the WHO said there have been 71 cases and 43 deaths up to October 7.
