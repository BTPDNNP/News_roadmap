A record 104 women are in the new Congress, and for the first time, African-American members of both genders are representing both parties. No seats in Congress are reserved for women or minorities.

The number of female lawmakers is up slightly from 100 at the close of the last Congress, but represents about 20 per cent of the total in Congress. It's far less than the nearly 51 per cent of the US population.

A total of 96 racial minorities will serve in Congress, about 18 per cent.

There are 100 senators and 435 seats in the House.

The House will have 246 Republicans and 188 Democrats. One seat is vacant following the resignation yesterday of Republican Michael Grimm, who pleaded guilty to a felony tax evasion charge.

The Senate will have 54 Republicans and 44 Democrats, plus two independents — Maine's Angus King and Vermont's Bernie Sanders. Both caucus with Democrats.

A total of 84 women will serve in the House, compared with 80 in the last Congress. The new lawmakers include Elise Stefanik, a 30-year-old New York Republican who is the youngest woman ever elected to the House. Also making history is Mia Love, 38, whose election to a suburban Salt Lake City district made her the first black female Republican to win a seat in Congress.

Forty-four African-Americans are in the House, including another black Republican freshman, Will Hurd of Texas. Hurd made news last month as he was named chairman of an Information Technology subcommittee on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, an unusual distinction for a new member.

There are 34 Hispanic lawmakers, including 10 Republicans, as well as 10 Asian-Americans and two Native Americans, both Republicans from Oklahoma.

Non-voting delegates represent the Washington capitol district, the commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of the US Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands.

The number of women in the Senate remains at 20, following the election of Republicans Joni Ernst of Iowa and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, and the defeat of Democrats Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana.
