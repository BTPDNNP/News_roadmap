NEW DELHI: Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said on Tuesday that he was stunned to hear that Delhi Police have filed a murder case in connection with Sunanda Pushkar's death.

"I am stunned to hear Delhi Police have filed a case of murder against unknown persons in the demise of my late wife. I am anxious to see the case is investigated thoroughly," Shashi Tharoor said.

"Although we never thought of any foul play in the death of my wife, we all want that a comprehensive investigation be conducted and the unvarnished truth should come out," he said.

"I assure police of my full co-operation in the investigation," Shashi Tharoor added.

He added that he and all members of Pushkar's family wanted access to all the information on the basis of which Delhi Police had concluded that she was poisoned to death.

"We have not been provided copies of the post-mortem report and other reports of the inquiry like the CFSL report till date. We repeat our request for a copy of these reports to be provided to us immediately," said Tharoor.

Sunanda Pushkar was found dead in mysterious circumstances in a luxury hotel in New Delhi on January 17 last year. Delhi Police chief B S Bassi said on Tuesday, almost a year later, that she was poisoned to death.
