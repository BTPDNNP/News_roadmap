Yahoo (YHOO) is under pressure by a key investor to merge with AOL. The change could be very profitable for Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer.
As is the case at most companies, Yahoo has a plan in place to pay executives including CEO Mayer in the case there is a change of control. At Yahoo, the payoff kicks in if there’s a change of control at the company and the executive loses a job within a year of the change.
Yahoo is under fire by activist investor Starboard for spending money on capital expenditures, but not getting any results in earnings or profit. Shares of Yahoo have moved higher this year, but primarily because the media company is holding billion of dollars worth of shares in Chinese e-commerce company, Alibaba.
To be sure, there’s no done deal nor even confirmation there could be one. Neither AOL nor Yahoo are talking about any combination. Shares of both companies are up sharply on the speculation. Yahoo stock is up $1.64 to $40.60 and AOL is up $1.34 to $44.45.
But if there were to be a change, Mayer would stand to haul in millions: $164 million to be exact.
The first part of the Yahoo change-in-control payout would be an an award of two years of base salary, which for Mayer would be $2 million. Her base salary in 2013 was $1 million. She would also get reimbursement for the expenses to find another job, up to $15,000. Yahoo estimates Mayer’s total cash several in a change-of-control would be $4.7 million.
Medical and dental plan coverage would continue for up to 24 months. But perhaps the most lucrative aspect of the windfall is the accelerated vesting of all stock options, restricted stock and other stock-based award.
All told, Mayer stands to bring in $164.6 million in cash severance plusstock and option acceleration if there’s a change of control at the company. The company’s filing states:

NCP colluded with BJP to impose Prez rule in Maha:ChavanPress Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: September 28, 2014 7:58 pm
Blaming NCP for severing ties with Congress, former Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan has alleged that Sharad Pawar’s party “colluded” with BJP for getting the state placed under President’s rule.
“The NCP demanded that the Chief Minister’s post be shared, according to which each party will have its chief minister for two-and-a-half years. Earlier, it was the party getting the maximum number of seats that got the chief ministership,” he told news channel CNN-IBN in an interview.
Chavan said the alliance ended on the grounds of demand for chief ministership and claimed that NCP leader and state’s former Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar put a pre-condition seeking to contest 144 of the 288 Assembly seats in the state, according to a release issued by the channel.
He alleged that NCP “colluded” with BJP to overthrow the state government just a few days before the Assembly polls.
“A game plan was worked out between BJP and NCP to pull the plug of the state government and the Governor will then recommend President’s Rule in the state,” he said.
Congress and NCP have been running the government in Maharashtra for the last 15 years but their alliance broke up last week over issues particularly seat-sharing between them.

(Panneerselvam's elevation…)
CHENNAI: Within hours of being elected as leader of AIADMK Legislature Party, O Panneerselvam was today invited by Tamil Nadu Governor K Rosaiah to form a government.
According to a Raj Bhavan communique, Panneerselvam, who was Finance Minister in J Jayalalithaa's ministry and represents Bodinayakanur constituency in the state Assembly, met Rosaiah and submitted a letter and the resolution passed by the AIADMK legislators who chose him unanimously, a day after the party supremo was jailed in a graft case.
"Consequently, His Excellency the Governor has invited him to form the Ministry," it said without divulging details.
Panneerselvam's elevation comes a day after J Jayalalithaa was disqualified as MLA following her conviction in the Rs 66.65 crore disproportionate assets case by a Bangalore special court.
She was sentenced to four years in jail.

Deputy national security adviser says countering Islamic State is nothing like wars in Iraq and AfghanistanBy Jaime Fuller September 28 Follow @j_fuller
Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken went on most of the Sunday shows this weekend as discussions turned nearly exclusively to international affairs after Congress left town to campaign. He made sure to reiterate how the United States planned to work with allies to combat the Islamic State and how the current mission is not comparable to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

"What we’re doing is totally different from the last decade," he told host Chris Wallace on "Fox News Sunday." "We’re not sending in tens of thousands of American troops on the ground."
On CNN's "State of the Union," Blinken added that the cost of the current plan is far less than the costs of the wars of the past decade and that officials remain focused on "empowering local actors."
"This is not America against ISIL," he said, using the administration's preferred term for the insurgents.
He also tried to counter the politicians and military figures who have raised the idea of American "boots on the ground," often on Sunday shows. Blinken said that escalating in that manner was exactly what the jihadists hoped for, calling it the "al-Qaeda trap."
“We’re not going to fall into their trap of sending hundreds of thousands of Americans back," he said. "That’s exactly what they want us to do. They want to bog us down.”
Not repeating the past was a theme Blinken repeated in all his appearance. He said on CBS's "Face the Nation: "This has to be local forces stepping up and fighting for their own country. We're not going to repeat what we've done before."
However, it also seems clear that this won't be a short engagement. ABC News correspondent Martha Raddatz talked to Navy Vice Adm. John Miller, who said that the United States' Islamic State targets were adapting to military tactics and becoming harder to locate. "They are a learning organization," he said. "But this is a long-term effort, so the strength of the coalition and our presence here will be here for quite some time."
On CNN, Blinken also said that Syrian rebels were another essential key to fighting the Sunni insurgents.

Live Cricket Score  CLT20  KXIP vs CC: KXIP beat CC by sevenwicketsWriddhiman Saha kept holding the one end as he guided the side home with his 35-ball 42. (Source; BCCI)

When Akshar Patel stepped up to bowl his third over, Kings XI Punjab were looking at possibly chasing down a target close to 200 when they came out to bat. Even though it was an inconsequential match for KXIP, another fruitful partnership between the Cape Cobras batsmen at the wicket would have snatched the game away from the home team. Having already booked their place in the last four, KXIP needed to keep the momentum going.
And Akshar did not disappoint. The left-arm spinner, who was one of the finds for KXIP in IPL-7, after finishing with 16 wickets, triggered a collapse by taking the crucial wicket of Sybrand Engelbrecht for 5.Engelbrecht had attemped a reverse sweep, but Akshar had spotted the premeditated shot early and fired the ball in faster. This particular wicket was followed by a period of play when the Cape Cobras lost five wickets for the a...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(25%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>modi india minister september pm prime indian police chief saturday</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>bjp state government minister party india pm congress delhi power</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic15.html>financial times share post company news ft health single policy</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic14.html>india financial times september company cent policy china percent market</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>rs cent year market india bank crore month growth prices</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic13.html>year government court money india company report quarter tax cent</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>time friday ebola people business city pm years good don</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>india september coal mars modi power make blocks isro mission</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
