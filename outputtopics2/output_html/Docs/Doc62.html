Market valuation of BSE listed cos nears Rs 100 lakh crore markFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
As the benchmark BSE Sensex is witnessing a dream-rally, the total market valuation of BSE-listed companies has inched closer to the Rs 100 lakh crore mark.
At present, the total market capitalisation (m-cap) of BSE-listed companies stands at Rs 97,13,196 crore which is just Rs 2.86 lakh short of the Rs 100 lakh crore milestone.
In terms of the US dollar, the total market valuation of BSE-listed companies has surged to USD 1.58 trillion at the current rupee rate of 61.41 against the Greenback.
India had first entered the trillion-dollar club in June 2007, but moved out in September 2008 after a global meltdown.
It again got back into the elite league in May 2009 and largely remained there except for some brief time, including once in 2012.
In August 2013, it had again slipped out of the list.
The Sensex has gained 6,745.2 points, or 31.86 per cent, so far this year. The index had hit its all-time high of 28,010.39 yesterday.
Experts said expectations of more reforms by the Narendra Modi-led government and a rate cut by the RBI has helped markets scale new heights.
The Sensex blue-chips whose market valuation is more than Rs 1 lakh crore include TCS, ONGC, RIL, ITC, Infosys, HDFC Bank,
Coal India, SBI, ICICI Bank, Sun Pharma, HDFC, HUL, L&T, Bharti Airtel, Tata Motors, Wipro, NTPC, HCL Tech and Axis Bank.
Outsourcing giant TCS is the most valued Indian company with a market cap of Rs 5,09,435.77 crore.
Marketmen said Indian markets are also making merry, helped by smart foreign fund inflows.
Since the beginning of this year, overseas investors have infused a net amount of Rs 82,266 crore (USD 13.7 billion) into the equities, while they invested a net of Rs 1.36 lakh crore into the debt market (USD 22.5 billion) taking the total to Rs 2.18 lakh crore (USD 36 billion).

A Man Will Be Eaten Alive On TVreddit
In what just might be the most bizarre concept for a reality TV show ever, a man will be eaten alive by an anaconda .
Called, appropriately enough, " Eaten Alive ," the Dec. 7 special features filmmaker Paul Rosolie being covered in pig blood and then swallowed by the snake , according to Entertainment Weekly.
Promo clips such as the one above show Rosolie putting on a special, and presumably protective, suit.
"You have to go head first," Rosolie says in one of the clips.
He's also tethered to something as he approaches the snake. Since the show has already been filmed and Rosolie has been active on Twitter , it's a safe bet that he is pulled back out again.
But some viewers are concerned about the fate of the snake, and are already protesting the show. There's even a petition on Change.org calling on Discovery to pull the plug.
" This is animal abuse to the highest degree and absolutely disgusting, and could kill the snake ," the petition reads. "An adult green anaconda cannot fit the width of an adult man's shoulders into it's body."
Rosolie defended himself and the show.
" I understand that many people have questions ," Rosolie wrote on his website. "All I can tell you now is that all my work is based around the fact that wildlife and ecosystems today, across the globe, are at a critical moment."
He said snakes are being threatened by hunting and habitat destruction.
"For those worried about animal cruelty, I invite you to research my work -- read my book ," Rosolie added. "Then ask yourself: would this person ever hurt an animal?"

Shiv Sena demands one more Union Cabinet berth

(A Sena leader said that ifâ€¦)
MUMBAI: Whether the Shiv Sena would be part of the BJP government in Maharashtra may be decided on Sunday when Narendra Modi expands his Union Cabinet.
The Sena has demanded that it be given one more Cabinet berth for its nominee. A Sena leader said that if BJP would not agree to its demand, then there was no point in joining the BJP government in Maharashtra.
The Sena demand comes after BJP rejected its claim for a deputy chief minister in Maharashtra.
With Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis ruling out the possibility of Sena ministers being accommodated before the vote of confidence, the Sena now wants BJP to show its 'commitment to the alliance' by inducting at least one more Sena minister in the Modi Cabinet.
"When Uddhav decided to come for the swearing in on the call of BJP leaders, the understanding was that our MLAs would be sworn in before Fadnavis wins the vote of confidence. However, BJP has ruled it out. So effectively it wants us to support it in the vote of confidence without even telling us what portfolios we would be given. If BJP is serious in our support in Maharashtra, we need a Cabinet berth at the Centre," said a Sena leader.
According to a Sena source, the party has decided that it won't wait after Sunday. If the party is not given a good Union Cabinet berth, then it might announce the name of the Opposition Leader in Maharashtra. Uddhav held a meeting of top Sena leaders on Thursday, where it was decided that the party would wait till the Union Cabinet expansion on Sunday.
The overwhelming feeling in the Sena was that BJP was bent on humiliating it and Sena should sit in the opposition. "It is unfortunate that our leadership is taking such humiliation lying down. We should sit in the opposition," said a Sena leader. Among the perceived humiliation is the reported news of former Sena MP Suresh Prabhu being given a ministerial berth at the Centre.
