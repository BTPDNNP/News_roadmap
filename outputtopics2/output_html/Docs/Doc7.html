Net Neutrality Matters to Communities of Colorreddit
The Internet is a place where people who do not have a seat at the table can amplify their voices. That's why working people must be front and center when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) decides what to do about net neutrality.
Net neutrality -- the concept of an open Internet where all content is treated equally -- would stop companies that provide Internet access from controlling what you can see online. It means that companies like Comcast and Charter cannot make certain websites harder to visit than others or prevent certain topics from being discussed. An Internet governed by net neutrality is a place where all individuals can engage in public discourse, regardless of the size of their checking account.
An open Internet protects opportunities for communities of color. It lets people report on injustice and organize to confront it. An open Internet helps people of color launch businesses online, with lower startup costs than entrepreneurs often face. It lets artists and creators tell their own stories, rather than depending on traditional media to decide which stories are worth telling.
The recent events in Ferguson, Missouri, serve as an example of how a community can use the Internet to organize and join together in the aftermath of a tragedy. In the aftermath of Michael Brown's death, images and stories shared by Ferguson residents on the Internet became a major part of news coverage. If Internet providers had made it difficult for residents to share their videos and pictures with the public, the story of Ferguson would be fundamentally different.
But some corporations want to end net neutrality in order to control content and increase profits. They want fast lanes for some web traffic but slow lanes for everyone else. Independent blogs and small startups that cannot afford the fees would be stuck in the slow lane. Communities of color -- long underrepresented in public dialogue -- would be among those hardest hit by such censorship.
The FCC is currently considering implementing a new regulatory classification for the Internet, which would promote social justice and economic equality. The FCC classifies certain forms of communications as utilities, or "common carriers." Common carriers, like those providing landline telephone services, are required to provide equal service to all users regardless of what they use it for. Classifying broadband Internet as a common carrier would preserve net neutrality and ensure tha...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(19%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>india october oct company indian ist global pakistan infosys maharashtra</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(16%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic15.html>financial times share post company news ft health single policy</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>rs cent year market india bank crore month growth prices</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic13.html>year government court money india company report quarter tax cent</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>bjp state government minister party india pm congress delhi power</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic14.html>india financial times september company cent policy china percent market</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>time friday ebola people business city pm years good don</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>october people oct india kong hong financial modi year times</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
