Warren Buffett defended Burger King's plan to expatriate to Canada in an appearance on CNBC's Squawk Box Thursday morning, saying that the deal isn't a move to skirt taxes.
"I would tell you that overwhelmingly most inversion deals have had a huge tax motivation in doing them. I can tell you this one didn't," the billionaire Berkshire Hathaway CEO responded when host Andrew Ross Sorkin asked if the deal was unpatriotic.
In August, Burger King announced plans to acquire the Canadian coffee and donut chain Tim Hortons for about $11 billion, moving the struggling fast-food company's headquarters from Miami to Toronto. The deal, which would create a combined company with projected sales of $23 billion , has been under scrutiny by critics who accuse Burger King of trying to dodge paying U.S. taxes.
"It doesn't have anything to do with taxes. It has to do with the fact that Tim Hortons earns twice as much money as Burger King does," Buffett said.
Though Burger King did not respond immediately to a request for comment, the company has maintained in the past that the deal isn't about dodging taxes.
In September, the  U.S. Treasury Department announced new rules that would make so-called inversion deals more difficult, but it's unclear if the new rules will have much of an impact on Burger King.

I would start out strong, then get winded, then end up walking more of the training run, than actually running it. Alas, race day was here, and I was determined to complete it. I wasn't concerned with my ra...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(21%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>october people oct india kong hong financial modi year times</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(16%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic15.html>financial times share post company news ft health single policy</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>bjp state government minister party india pm congress delhi power</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic13.html>year government court money india company report quarter tax cent</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>rs cent year market india bank crore month growth prices</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>time friday ebola people business city pm years good don</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic14.html>india financial times september company cent policy china percent market</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
