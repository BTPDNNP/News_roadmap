Decision on gas pricing put off again
Mahim Pratap Singh
The decision to defer the revision of gas prices by another 45 days was taken at a meeting of the Union Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The government on Wednesday postponed the decision on revising gas prices till November 15.
The decision to defer the revision of gas prices by another 45 days was taken at a meeting of the Union Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The decision was conveyed by Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad.
Earlier, the NDA government had deferred the implementation of the Rangarajan formula, approved by the previous UPA-regime, till September 30. The Rangarajan committee recommendations would have led to a doubling of gas prices to USD 8.4 per million per British thermal unit.
Last year, the UPA government had approved pricing suggested by the C. Rangarajan panel, re-confirming it in December 2013 with certain conditions for Reliance Industries' eastern offshore KG-D6 block.
The Rangarajan formula, however, could not come into effect due to the general elections being announced and the EC asking the government to defer it till the end of polls.

Bayada eyes tie-up with more hospitalshealthcare provider
US based home healthcare firm Bayada Home Healthcare is looking to tie up with more hospital chains in India.
The privately held firm with $1 billion revenue is looking at India as a major market for expansion outside the US. The home healthcare services are mainly nursing or medical services provided at home.
“Home Healthcare market in India is at a very nascent stage and highly unorganized. With growing middle class and NRI population the demand for home healthcare would increase,” J. Mark Baiada, founder, Bayada Home Healthcare said.
In 2013, Bayada picked up a 26 per cent stake in Chennai-based India Home Health Care. India Home Health Care currently operates in Chennai and Bangalore and caters to 3000 patients annually. The firm recently entered a 30:70 joint venture with Gujarat-based Sterling Group of Hospitals to offer home healthcare services in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. It currently has tie up with Mehta Hospitals and Fortis Malar Hospitals.
Mr. Baiada said the firm would be looking to tie-up with more hospital chains which would be done through India Home Health Care.
He also said it is easy to scale up the model as it is service oriented and not capital intensive.
