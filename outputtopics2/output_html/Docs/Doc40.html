But you aren't surprised when your cup comes back with the scribblings, "Bahwbuh."
That's because Starbucks baristas misspell customers names all the time.
But have you ever wondered why?
In this video from comedian Paul Gale , we are clued in to the meaningful and ultra powerful reason baristas spell your name wrong.
Hint: It's not because they misheard you, or because they don't know how to spell "Bob." No, sir. It's a little more messed up than that.

SFC personnel test-fires Agni-Idefence
Agni-I, a surface-to-surface, nuclear-weapons-capable ballistic missile, was test-fired for its 700-km strike range from the Wheeler Island, off the Odisha Coast, on Thursday.
Strategic Forces Command (SFC) personnel launched the single-stage, short-range missile, powered by a solid propellant, from a rail mobile launcher as part of regular user training to consolidate operational readiness.
The missile carrying a 1,100-kg payload zeroed in on the target with a high degree of accuracy, a missile scientist with the Defence Research and Development Organisation said. Describing it as a fantastic launch, he said the missile achieved a CEP (circular error probability) of about 50 metres. Its trajectory was tracked and monitored by sophisticated radars, telemetry observation stations, electro-optic instruments and naval ships through the 550-second flight.
The first night-trial of the missile was conducted in April.

Wal-Mart spurns Apple on payment systems3
CurrentC works on any smartphone, not just the iPhone, so it has a larger potential market. And when a shopper is ready to buy a product, the CurrentC app creates a type of bar code — called a QR code — that can be recognized by most checkout scanners today.
Apple Pay uses a chip that sends signals a short distance through the air using technology called near-field communication, or NFC. But only 10 percent of merchants have sensors that can read such signals, and such devices can cost about $500 to install. However, retailers have been ordered by credit card companies to upgrade their registers to models that probably will include NFC technology.
Apple's system allows users to load their credit and debit cards onto an iPhone. A consumer would merely need to hold the smartphone close to a NFC sensor and confirm the purchase with a fingerprint scan.
Apple has said that it has no interest in tracking the purchases shoppers make through Apple Pay. Company executives said this week that the details of any transaction would be known only by shoppers and their financial firms. CurrentC's organizers have not said whether retailers will track purchases made with their system, but many analysts expect them to do so. Many chains already track customers' shopping behavior through loyalty cards or even by monito...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(25%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>true post false comments september canvas watcher top display washpost</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(18%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>bjp state government minister party india pm congress delhi power</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(17%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>rs cent year market india bank crore month growth prices</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic15.html>financial times share post company news ft health single policy</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic13.html>year government court money india company report quarter tax cent</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>time friday ebola people business city pm years good don</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
