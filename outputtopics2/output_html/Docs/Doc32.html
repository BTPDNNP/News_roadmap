As per the merger formula, BSE proposes to issue one equity share of Re.1 each for every 385 equity shares of USE.
The United Stock Exchange of India Ltd (USE) and BSE Ltd. have convened separate meetings of their equity shareholders in Mumbai on October 20 to seek their approval for the proposed merger of the former with the latter.
Recently, the Securities and Exchange Board of India and the Competition Commission of India had granted their approval for the proposed merger. Similarly, applications have been filed by them before the Bombay High Court seeking its approval.
As per the merger formula, BSE proposes to issue one equity share of Re.1 each for every 385 equity shares of USE. The share exchange ratio was recommended by S.R. Batliboi & Co LLP. After the amalgamation, the paid-up equity capital of the BSE would increase to 10.73 crore from Rs. 10.57 crore.
Post-merger, the equity holding of institutions and non-institutions in BSE would increase to 57.82 per cent from 56.83 per cent, while that of trading members and their associates would dip from 43.17 per cent to 42.18 cent.
In the explanation statements, BSE and USE said that their board of directors had given their nod for the merger during May. The merger would come into force from April 1, 2014.
According to the EGM notice, USE and BSE are recognised stock exchanges. Currently, there were four stock exchanges in the country that provided trading platform in currency derivatives and interest rate derivatives segment. The BSE started providing trading facility in currency derivative segment since November 2013.
The merger would lead to consolidation of this sector and improve liquidity.
USE is a public limited company incorporated on October 15, 2008. It has a paid-up capital of Rs.154.50 crore of which 14.56 per cent was held by BSE.
The shareholders of USE comprise of 21 nationalised banks, six private banks and one bank based out of India.

JLL India estimates that six million sq.ft. of mall space will be added in 2014
The entry of real estate investment trusts (REITs) in the Indian market is expected to infuse a large dose of liquidity into the cash-strapped commercial real estate sector and could be a game changer.
In India, of the estimated 350 million square feet of ‘Grade A’ office space — valued at around $65-70 billion — concentrated in the major urban centres, about 80-100 million sq. ft is estimated to be eligible for REITs in the next 2-3 years, valued at about $15-20 billion, according to KPMG in India.
Apart from these, there are a host of other commercial properties such as shopping centres, retail malls, among others, which are eligible for REITs.
Retail malls in particular had seen developers rush in and churn out malls all over the country, but the rising vacancy rates following the economic slowdown saw a slowdown on the supply of mall space. An improvement in consumer sentiment now is good news for organised retail.
“The overall vacancy rate today stands high at about 20 per cent in retail malls across major Indian cities, while superior grade malls have vacancy rates averaging at only 10 per cent,” said Suvishesh Valsan, senior analyst (Research & REIS), JLL India, a real estate consultancy.
JLL India estimates that six million sq. ft of mall space will be added in 2014.
Given that international retailers will prefer to take up space in these malls, the shortage of quality space is evident, and will be felt for some time. REITs, in order to provide attractive yields, have to buy assets at a reasonable price. While upcoming superior grade malls will offer lucrative investment opportunities, some existing lower grade malls could be up for sale at a discount. “For instance, of Mumbai’s 65 existing malls, only 20 are of...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(17%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>india october oct company indian ist global pakistan infosys maharashtra</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(16%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>rs cent year market india bank crore month growth prices</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic15.html>financial times share post company news ft health single policy</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>bjp state government minister party india pm congress delhi power</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic13.html>year government court money india company report quarter tax cent</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic14.html>india financial times september company cent policy china percent market</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>october people oct india kong hong financial modi year times</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>time friday ebola people business city pm years good don</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
