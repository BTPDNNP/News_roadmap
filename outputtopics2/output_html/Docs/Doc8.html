India Post best for e-commerce delivery serv...Indian postal service
(Prasad said there is a need…)
NEW DELHI: Communication and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad today said India Post with the world's largest postal network is best suited to offer delivery services to e-commerce firms.
Prasad, who today met Probationers of the 2013 batch of the Indian Postal Service here, said there is a need to expose young officers to the latest developments and emerging trends in the postal and logistics sectors.
The Minister highlighted that the Digital India project, which aims to make broadband facility available in every village across the country, would drive up e-commerce business in villages.
With its unparalleled rural reach, India Post would be best suited to offer delivery services to e-commerce players, he added.
India Post has over 1.55 lakh post offices of which more than 1.39 lakh are in the rural areas. On an average, a post office serves an area of 21.21 sq. km and a population of 7,175 people.
According to market analysts, last-mile delivery of products ordered by online shoppers will figure as one of the major deciding factors for e-commerce firms like Flipkart, Snapdeal, Amazon, etc.
Firms are already offering one-day delivery and this will further intensify with firms investing hugely in logistics to ramp up their delivery system.
The opportunity in back-end logistics for online shopping segment is estimated to be about Rs 3,500-4,000 crore, a major part of which is last mile delivery.
According to a joint study by consultancy firm PwC and industry body Assocham, the size of the e-retail industry is poised to touch $10-20 billion by 2017-2020 and e-commerce firms are expected to spend up to $1.9 billion by 2017-2020 on infrastructure, logistics and warehousing.
Another report by consulting firm Technopak pegs the $2.3 billion e-tailing market to reach $32 billion by 2020.
Prasad said Post Office can also become a focal point for delivering not only government services but also e-services to the people as in e-service centres, apart from commercially remunerative services for corporate/private players including conducting market surveys, information dissemination, etc.

Nokia launches ‘selfie-centric’ Lumia smartphones

Users can take selfies with rear camera using the Lumia selfie app, which uses face-detection technology.
Microsoft will seek to draw more people to its Internet-based services with two new mid-range smartphones it unveiled on Thursday, including one designed to help people take better selfies.
Both devices are under the Lumia brand Microsoft bought from Nokia. They run the latest version of Windows Phone 8 and feature Cortana, a Siri-like voice assistant available to help with directions, calendar appointments and messages. Many of those interactions will steer users to Microsoft services such as Bing search and OneDrive storage.
Microsoft bought Nokia’s phone business in April as it seeks to boost Microsoft’s Windows Phone system, which has had little traction compared with Apple’s iPhones and Google’s Android system. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has made mobile phones and Internet-based services priorities for the company as its traditional businesses Windows and Office software installed on desktops slow down or decline.
Microsoft used the IFA technology show in Berlin to announce the new Lumia 730 and 830 phones.
The handsets won’t have all the technical advances found in Microsoft’s pricier flagship, the Lumia 930 phone, which is known as the Lumia Icon in the United States. The 730’s rear camera takes 6.7 megapixel shots, while the 830 is 10 megapixels. By contrast, the 930 phone is at 20 megapixels, one of the highest in a smartphone.
But the 730, in particular, will have features designed for better selfies. The front camera used for selfies will be 5 megapixels, higher than the 2 megapixels found in the 830 and many other phones.
For even better shots, it’ll be possible to take selfies with the rear camera. Users won’t be able to see themselves on the screen, but an app called Lumia Selfie will use face-detection technology and beeps to guide users on where to hold the camera. Samsung’s upcoming Note phones will have a similar feature, along with software to stitch multiple shots on the front camera to fit more people in.
The 830 has a 5-inch screen, measured diagonally, and supports 4G LTE cellular networks. It will cost about 330 euros ($435).
The 4.7-inch 730 will cost 199 euros. It will have 3G connectivity and slots for two SIM cards, an important feature in emerging markets where wireless plans vary widely such that users switch services often to get the best deals. A 4G version will be known as the 735 and will cost 219 euros. That will have just one SIM slot.
The new phones will start shipping in September, though not necessarily right away in all markets. Typically, Lumia phones make it to the U.S. under different model numbers.

NASA hurls insults at Curiosity  the worlds favorite roverBy Rachel Feltman September 4 Follow @rachelfeltman
On Wednesday, NASA released reports reviewing the seven major planetary exploration missions. All seven were given renewed funding (yay!), but although it's arguably the most popular among the general public (for proof, just look to the star-studded video above), the Mars Curiosity mission got a stern talking to.
"The panel essentially said, 'Drive less and do more science,'" Bill Knopf, the lead program executive for planetary mission operations at NASA headquarters, told Science Magazine . The review panel expressed disappointment in the plan for the rover's mission, which was recently extended indefinitely. "The panel viewed this as a poor science return for such a large investment in a flagship mission," the full report states .
