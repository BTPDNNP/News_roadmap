Deepak Parekh, chairman of Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), India’s largest mortgage lender, says the exuberance in industry about the new government is justified but big ideas articulated by the prime minister need speedy implementation. In an interview with Shyamal Majumdar & Manojit Saha, he also backed the Reserve Bank of India’s decision to hold interest rates and said he expected only a marginal rate cut in 2015. Edited excerpts:
Do you share the general exuberance in industry about the new government?
I do not think the exuberance is irrational. The quarterly growth rate is higher, inflation is relatively low, commodity prices are falling, oil prices are the lowest in five years, the current account deficit level is comfortable, gold imports have come down and diesel subsidy has almost vanished.
We are waiting for the government to say diesel prices will be market-determined. We, in fact, expect diesel prices to come down after the state elections.
Do you see any dark spots?
Uncertainty hurts and, therefore, should go. It is time the government started taking decisions. For instance, coal. No one knows what is going to happen (after the court decision on deallocation of mines). Coal India is making statements that it does not want to take those mines because it does not have staff to manage those. It does not have a chairman for a long time. These are not “big-bang reforms”.
Also, a decision on gas pricing has been postponed twice already. This means fertiliser and power plants do not get gas. How can you run a country like this? You have to move on. Take a decision, whatever it is. Look at BSNL, which is another Air India in the making. BSNL has accumulated losses of Rs 22,000 crore. MTNL is also suffering losses, though private telecom companies are making money. How long will government funds be used to pay the monthly salaries of Air India employees?
