Buy? Sell? Buy back? Sell again? Fourth quarter leaves investors unsure.
Stocks are pricey but professional investors see no other game in town.
As the stock market enters the last quarter of the year, investors are expected to stick with stocks. Not because they think stocks are a great deal. Rather, professional investors see no other game in town.
Many analysts repeatedly note that stocks are pricey in a world full of economic and geopolitical threats that could send investors running to the exits.
Though cautious, pros feel compelled to invest when they have money. And since bonds at low interest rates hold little appeal with rates likely to rise next year, the pros generally end up favoring stocks.

"We are still moderately positive on stocks although they are moderately expensive and the U.S. is quite expensive," said Andrew Pease, strategist for Russell Investments.
His rationale for buying stocks is a common one: U.S. companies keep producing solid earnings, low interest rates make stocks relatively attractive compared with bonds, and central banks in Europe and Japan are busy stimulating the economy. That stimulus means there is a lot of money in the system. So pros feel compelled to invest rather than sit on cash.
In addition, although the stock market has been climbing for six years and could run out of steam after such a lengthy period, Pease is encouraged by the fact that there is "no over-exuberance" among investors for stocks now. Typically, bull — or climbing — markets end when investors don't see risks and figure making money in the stock market is a no-brainer.
In the current market, pros are repeatedly noting potential risks and buying reluctantly after roughly a 7 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 this year.
Last week, the stock market moved in fits up and down by more than 100 points a day as investors debated whether it made sense to stick with stocks.
Concerns throughout the third quarter kept investors on guard, with the S&P gaining just 0.7 percent. Analysts expect volatility to continue, especially as they see signs that the Federal Reserve might be getting ready to let interest rates start moving upward in 2015. (Low rates allow companies to borrow money inexpensively. As rates rise, borrowing costs go up, making it more difficult to expand and grow profits.)

Dealing with an encroaching neighbor0
A: Adverse possession is probably low on the list of things you have to worry about. One basic element of adverse possession is that the person using your land affirmatively uses it against your desire and does not acknowledge that it is yours. If your neighbor has made statements to you indicating that she believes that she is using your land, you probably don't have an issue with adverse possession.
Furthermore, if you simply give her permission to use the swing set until it is removed, she might have to affirmatively claim that the swing set is on land she owns to claim adverse possession in the future.
The insurance issue might be a bit trickier. If a person is injured on your land, you might have some liability. However, if you carry liability insurance, you might be covered. It might help to post signs that people use the swing set at their own risk. Putting up no trespassing signs around your property can limit some of your exposure.
Since you didn't build or install the equipment, and you aren't permitting the use of the equipment, if someone is injured there and wants to sue you, they might have to prove that you had some sort of duty to care for the equipment. That might be a long shot if you put signs around your property to keep trespassers out and warning users of the equipment do so at their own risk.
In terms of being neighborly, you could have a surveyor come out and simply mark the property line on that part of the property. Some surveyors are able to give you a survey of a portion of your property. You may discover you are wrong about where your property boundary is located.
Call around and find out what a surveyor would charge you to locate the swing set on your property. You might find that it's not that expensive.
If it turns out that the swing set is located on your property, you then have to decide how to deal with the neighbor.
You can talk to your insurance agent and find out what suggestions he or she has for your regarding your coverage. If you find out you have sufficient liability insurance, you then would only need to make sure that you protect your property interests.
You could build a fence around your property, but that will be quite expensive. The posting of signage will be far less costly. If your neighbor acknowledges in writing that she does not own the land on which the swing set is located, you will have taken that issue off the table. And if you discuss with her your liability concerns, you might find that she understands them and will supervise the kids using the set. Who knows? You might be surprised by her neighborly att...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(23%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic11.html>november financial year india times indian nov time delhi years</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic13.html>year government court money india company report quarter tax cent</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(13%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>rs cent year market india bank crore month growth prices</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(13%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic15.html>financial times share post company news ft health single policy</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>bjp state government minister party india pm congress delhi power</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic14.html>india financial times september company cent policy china percent market</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>time friday ebola people business city pm years good don</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
