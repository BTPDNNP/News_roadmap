Jump to the next curve. “Most institutions define themselves in terms of what they already do,” Kawasaki said. If companies were more forward-looking, their demise would become less likely. This doesn’t mean switching industries; it means delivering the same benefit through different mechanisms. Kawasaki said telegraph companies might still be around if they’d recognized their value in delivering messages and embraced the telephone.
DICEE. Kawasaki said the best products and services are deep, intelligent, complete, empowering and elegant. As an example, he mentioned the Ford MyKey device, which parents can program to prohibit teen drivers from passing a determined speed limit.
Get shipping. “If you wait for the perfect time, if you wait for the perfect product, you will never ship,” Kawasaki said. Riffing on a certain popular song, he said innovators often “don’t worry, be crappy.” That’s not to say he encouraged creators to sell junk, but to ship products that are innovative despite imperfections.
Let flowers blossom. Despite best efforts at branding, marketing or advertising, a company sometimes attracts the “wrong” customer. Instead of freaking out, Kawasaki recommends that companies ask those people why they’re buying the product, or why they’re using it in a way other than the company intended. That can lead to a new direction or a new life for the company.
Ignore the haters. Products such as TiVo, Macintosh and Android inspire adoration and ire. “I’m not telling you that you should intentionally piss people off, but I’m telling you revolutionary products tend to polarize people,” Kawasaki said. “It’s OK.”
Churn, baby, churn. The process of churning a product from 1.0 to 1.1 all the way to 2.0 and beyond is the hardest part of innovation, Kawasaki said. “You need to ignore what the customers are telling you because they can only tell you to revise the current curve,” he said. Only the people working on the product can know how to take it to the next level.
Marketing is simple. Companies should measure their products or services on their uniqueness and value. It’s OK to be low in uniqueness if you’re high in value, because then you can compete on price, Kawasaki said. But it’s best to be high in value and in uniqueness, because then you can charge a premium.
Perfect your pitch. Kawasaki said the perfect pitch features 10 slides, lasts 20 minutes and uses size 30 font. He gave even more importance to personalization. For example, when he pitched to a company in Turkey, he opened with a picture of him wearing a fez in Istanbul’s grand bazaar, which helped forge an immediate connection.

Heli-skiing: into the wildFirst tracks: round-up of the season’s developments
“In addition to the somewhat frivolous thrill of dancing down the hill, [the ski tourer] also seeks the aesthetic values inherent in the mountain country to which the ordinary skier is completely oblivious,” he enthused. “Ski touring takes us on to those mountains and slopes which we always look at from the top of our lifts and wish we were over there instead of here. It gives us the means to manifest our, however hidden and subconscious, desires to expl...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(27%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic12.html>october india times oct financial government minister bjp year party</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(18%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic15.html>financial times share post company news ft health single policy</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>rs cent year market india bank crore month growth prices</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(13%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic13.html>year government court money india company report quarter tax cent</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>time friday ebola people business city pm years good don</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>bjp state government minister party india pm congress delhi power</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic14.html>india financial times september company cent policy china percent market</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
