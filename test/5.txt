Before venturing into Marathi films with 'Ajoba', Urmila Matondkar had made a name for herself in Hindi cinema as a sensuous and at the same time powerful actress.

Director Ram Gopal Varma was blown away by her beauty and was known to present his muse Urmila in the most sensuous forms in his films. The waterfall was often used to add to her sensuality. In the song 'Zehreela pyaar' from Daud, Urmila is seen dancing under a waterfall and a mesmerised Sanjay Dutt watches her bathing with as much interest as the audience did. Urmila made her debut in Marathi films quite late despite Marathi being her mother tongue.

Sujay Dahake's 'Ajoba' gave ample scope for Urmila to essay the role inspired by wildlife researcher Vidya Athreya. But even so, her characters from 'Rangeela' and 'Daud' are among the best remembered ones. The waterfall bathing scene from 'Daud' which has Sanjay Dutt catching Urmila taking a cool dip under the waterfall features on many of the top ten waterfall scenes lists of Bollywood.
