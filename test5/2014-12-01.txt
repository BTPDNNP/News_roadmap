Chaiti Bai’s story and modern India
Krishna Kumar
Chhattisgarh
The deaths of Chaiti Bai and other women after a botched tubectomy in Chhattisgarh are an opportunity to reflect on the problems India faces in the pursuit of modernity and global status, especially in health and education
A sudden death always has great pedagogical value. The death of Chaiti Bai, a Baiga tribal woman, following a botched tubectomy at a mass sterilisation camp in Chhattisgarh recently, can improve our perspective on India’s history as a modern nation. She was one of the 14 women who gained momentary national attention after a State doctor had operated on them in what is said to have been an unhygienic medical camp.
Mid-November, when the incident happened, also marks the birth anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru, and separately, the opening of New Delhi’s international trade fair. Both events had special status this year. The deaths of Chaiti Bai and other women at the camp give us an opportunity to reflect on the problems India faces in the pursuit of modernity and global status through rapid industrial progress.
To get an idea of this, one has to set out on a three-hour car ride from the villages where Chaiti Bai and the other young women lived, to Bhilai, where one of the three gigantic steel plants was set up by the new nation-state in the 1950s with the help of friendly foreign nations. It made eminent sense to set up a modern industrial plant in this economically backward area because a vast deposit of iron ore lies under the earth here. The larger problem, however, is above the surface, and has two parts: one, a dense forest, and two, a substantial population of tribal people. Chaiti Bai belonged to a small tribe known as the Baiga. Performing a tubectomy on Chaiti Bai was an illegal act because there is a ban on carrying out a sterilisation on a Baiga. This is one of the few civic attainments of this unique tribe. Their numbers are declining, and the Constitution of India protects every Scheduled Tribe from extinction.
Tribal knowledge
In India’s tribal world, the Baiga are renowned for their gift and depth of medical knowledge, which includes their ancient tradition of healing with substances derived from the plant world. How this knowledge is transferred to the young was the subject of research carried out by Dr. Padma Sarangapani about a decade ago. In her interactions with nine-year-old Baiga boys and girls she found that they could recognise by name and distinguish the medicinal properties of 60 trees. “They stopped their list,” she writes, “because of consideration for me because I could no longer keep track.” Dr. Sarangapani lamented the indifference shown to this knowledge by schoolteachers. As expected, they teach the official curriculum. The system is not tuned to show respect for a child’s knowledge, and Baiga children are no exception. They are treated like any group of poor, backward children. The schools they attend look at routine goals like attaining basic numeracy and literacy.
Record in education
All the young women who died in Bilaspur were literate enough to sign away their fertility for small sums of money. Their signatures imparted legality to their sterilisation. Literate they were, but not educated enough to know what problems they might face, starting with the risk of contracting infection from a dirty, bare floor. Their exposure to modern schooling was not enough to impart to them the confidence needed to resist the persuasive pressure of an experienced doctor determined to achieve his personal tubectomy targets for the year. The women who died were poor and ordinary. One of them is reported to have screamed in pain. The doctor shouted at her and went on with the procedure. From these deaths we can learn how insubstantial and irrelevant education is also inconsequential.
India has sophisticated technologies in communication, aviation and warfare, but its schools are crude. Why India’s record in elementary education remains so modest needs no commission of inquiry. In a public lecture delivered in the 1980s, Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen had explained the reasons for our educational backwardness by using the proverb, “as you sow, so you reap.” We never made significant investments in children’s education, so we should not expect wonderful results. Underneath this general story of neglect, however, lies the details of an iniquitous system. Between the provisions for an average village school and a Kendriya Vidyalaya, the gap has been as vast as the social distance between a peasant and a civil servant.
Tribes and the state
Children’s education has never been a major part of anyone’s vision of prosperity and progress. Some may see this as an oxymoron and ask: “how can progress be achieved without education?” Instead, they should ask a more basic question: ‘How can progress be achieved without health?’ Surely, health is more basic than education. Since Independence, both these areas of welfare have been consistently served by rhetoric and neglect. The only major change visible in recent decades is the state’s careful manoeuvres to withdraw without being noticed, enabling commercial interests to take over. Areas designated as “tribal” are no exception to this general trend. The paradox they represent in the story of development is not radically different from what rural India in general represents. India’s aspiration to become a modern nation presented a problem as soon as Constitution drafting began after the end of colonial rule. The problem had to do with defining the civic rights of tribes. Simply put, the question was to decide the extent of rights tribes would have on the forests they inhabited and used freely for their livelihood. The question was not unique to India, nor was the legal solution India adopted unique.
It was decided that tribal people could not claim sovereign right on forests and the minerals that lay underneath. The state’s sovereignty would extend to these resources, and in return, so to say, the state would promise to protect tribes and treat them as a privileged category in welfare policies and provisions. Had this privileged position of the tribes been translated into action, it would have meant a sophisticated system of education adjusted to tribal cultures, languages and knowledge. It would have meant differentiating among tribes and equipping the system to handle curricular and training details with specificity. As time went by, it became clear that the state was going to remain colonial in its outlook and actions. Tribal areas did receive certain privileges but they were not sufficient to protect tribal people from the aggressive greed of developers and contractors. Soon enough, the state’s resolve and sense of purpose got lost in a jungle of programmes and demands. A stark instance of this process has surfaced all over tribal regions. A recent one was the trial inoculation of thousands of girls studying in residential tribal schools in Andhra Pradesh against cervical cancer. Global pharmaceutical interests had succeeded in obtaining the State government’s approval. The State assumed that it could act on behalf of the girls.
The medical disaster in Chhattisgarh shows how helpless tribal people are. When Chhattisgarh was carved out of Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand from Bihar, it was assumed that smaller States would focus more efficiently — and sensitively too — on tribal issues. Fourteen years on, one has reasons to doubt the thesis that smaller political and administrative units are necessarily better. On the contrary, the lack of perspective persists. And in the context of tribal issues, it is not merely a question of perspective. State players perceive tribes through an ideological screen that makes tribal life and culture look like an obstacle to modernisation.
In recent years, Chhattisgarh has also been in the news for a State programme called Salwa Judum, launched to counter Maoism. Tens of thousands of tribal people have been displaced into camps under this programme, perpetuating the cycle of violence and misery. Political leaders and officers see it as a major attempt to reorganise the balance of forces in Chhattisgarh so as to prepare it for globalisation of the economy. But the region joined the global economy a long time ago when the export of iron ore began from the Bailadila mines in Bastar to Japan.
In a lecture delivered nearly 30 years ago, M.N. Buch, a former bureaucrat, showed the audience pictures of the landscape around these mines. His dire prediction that mining on this scale would turn the dense forest into a desert seemed reasonable. He was in despair about the impact the untrammelled exploitation of natural resources would have on the precarious life of tribes. The recent deaths of Chaiti Bai and the other tribal women justify Buch’s ominous prediction and despair.

Maple Leaf throws punch at Capital  decks linesman insteadBy Des Bieler November 30 Follow @DesBieler
Toronto’s Korbinian Holzer, left, and Washington’s Tom Wilson fight during Saturday’s game. (Darren Calabrese/Canadian Press via Associated Press)
It was late in the third period of the Capitals’ game Saturday against the Maple Leafs, and things were getting testy. Caps forward Tom Wilson had gone after a loose puck in the corner, and Leafs defenseman Korbinian Holzer took the opportunity to give the forward a couple of gratuitous whacks in the back.
Given that Washington was well on its way to a 6-2 loss , Wilson reasoned that the time was more than right to get into a scrap, and Holzer was willing to go. Wilson got the better of it, locking up Holzer, landing several hard blows and sending his opponent to the ice. At that point, a pair of linesman moved in to separate the two, and then this happened:
(courtesy of @myregularface )
That’s Holzer landing a solid shot to the face. Unfortunately, it was the face of linesman Steve Miller, who needed a few moments to recover. Here’s video of the sequence:
Of course, this being not only hockey, but a clip from “Hockey Night in Canada,” the announcers express no great outrage. In fact, one says, “I don’t blame” Holzer for being mad, given that “he got punched three times when he was down — that’s against the code.” Little sympathy is given to the poor linesman, although the fact that his face is “swollen already” is noted, but mostly as evidence that he got hit with “a good punch.”
For his part, Korbinian pointed out that he couldn’t see who he was punching, as his jersey had been pulled over his head. The defenseman did express some remorse, possibly sensing that some league-imposed sanction was in the offing.
Holzer said at first he thought his punch hit Wilson. Thought to himself “oh nice”. Quickly realized that wasn’t the case. — Shawn McKenzie (@ShawnMcKenzieSN) November 30, 2014
Holzer said he was hoping to see the linesman after to apologize. — Shawn McKenzie (@ShawnMcKenzieSN) November 30, 2014
Exasperated Holzer on possible suspension: “Well, I hope not. I hope they see it was unintentional. I’m not a guy who goes after linesmen.” — Mark Masters (@markhmasters) November 30, 2014

PM Narendra Modi bats for SMART policing  stronger intelligence gatheringAfter Christmas in school holiday row, Narendra Modi govt backtracks
Pitching for ‘SMART’ policing, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said intelligence gathering is the most vital aspect of the security essentials of the country which must honour its police martyrs and ensure welfare of police personnel.
The Prime Minister stressed that security of the nation does not depend on arms but on intelligence gathering.
Quoting Chanakya, the Prime Minister said, “Security of a nation does not depend on arms, how much arms are there or on the number of people using them. But depends more on intelligence gathering”.
“If intellegence gathering is strong than arms, armed men and use of arms do not become primary.Intelligence gathering is the most vital aspect of the security essentials. The nation which has the best intelligence is the strongest”, Modi said at the 49th annual conference of DGPs hosted by the Intelligence Bureau.
The Prime Minister said he wanted a force which takes care of the country’s law and order in an efficient manner.
“By ‘SMART’ policing, I mean S for strict but sensitive, M for modern and mobile, A for alert and accountable, R for reliable and responsive and T for techno-savvy and trained”, Modi said.
The police force should inculcate these values to ensure best policing which will go a long way in bringing about a new awakening and consciousness, improve its image and work culture, he said.
The Prime Minister also highlighted the need to honour the 33,000 police personnel martyred in the country after Independence as “this was not a small thing.They sacrificed for the country and the citizens security and peace. Their sacrifice while on duty should not go unrecognised”.
“The question of citizens knowing the police men’s sacrifice does not arise.The police itself does not know who these martyrs are”, Modi pointed out.
A task force has to be formed for a protocol to ensure that the force takes full responsibility of conducting last rites of martyrs with full honour as “they had died on duty for the safety and security of the common man”, the Prime Minister said.
“Besides, each state has a police academy where recruits are trained and in their syllabus it should be mandatory to include a book on the life of those police men killed on duty in their state and the courage they showed. This will inspire them”, Modi said.
“There should be a new official government book where the new generation of police will have to study about these martyrs–their lives and sacrifice and every year a new updated edition should be brought out”, he said.
The Prime Minister also called for bringing out an e- book in every state on these martyrs in the state language as well as the national languages and “this may seem to be a small gesture but will be an immense inspiration”.
Pointing out that many of the state police departments have annual cultural programmes, particularly Mumbai Police with the participation of film personalities, Modi asked them to “bring out a souvenir on the life story of the sacrifices of the police personnel of that state.They should never die whether or not they exist bodily”.
Underscoring the importance on police welfare, he said, “Policemen’s life is full of tension as they put their life at risk. Unless we ensure that there is peace and stability in their family, they cannot give their full to society and do their duty properly”.
“It is the responsibility of the government to set up a systematic programme to ensure certain welfare schemes to ease their lives like health checkup, their children’s education and their housing, particularly for those at the lower level”, he said.
“Our priority should be to bring change in a scientific manner”, he said.

UP: Bride s family hacks couple to death for marrying outside religionComments
Two months after a young couple got married secretly, the boy was chased down a street and his throat slit by the girl’s brother on Saturday in a UP village barely 75km from Delhi. His bride met the same fate when she rushed to his rescue.
 
Neighbours Sonu Kumar and Danista, both around 20, eloped Friday night after a panchayat in Fatehpur village, close to Ghaziabad, ordered them to separate. The girl’s family was against the union on grounds of religion. Sonu claimed the two had had a court marriage two months ago.

“After the panchayat, the couple eloped but came back Saturday morning. The girl’s infuriated family members, however, murdered them both,” Hapur district SP RP Pandey said.
Danista’s brother, Talib, chased Sonu down the street and attacked him with a knife, Sonu’s brother Sanjeev Kumar told HT. Hearing his screams, Danista also ran out. “But her brother pulled her hair and slashed her throat. Her mother arrived on the scene and instigated Talib to finish off the injured Sonu. Talib then slit his throat as villagers and children looked on,” said Manju, an eyewitness.
The police have arrested both Talib and his mother and lodged an FIR against six persons — including two more brothers of the girl and two of their friends — for rioting, murder and under provisions of the SC/ST Act. The remaining accused are on the run.
The alleged ‘honour killing’ comes just a fortnight after a DU student was strangled to death by her family in southwest Delhi’s Dwarka for marrying a man they didn’t approve of.

Murli Manohar Joshi to inaugurate madrasa inKanpurWritten by Lalmani Verma |
Posted: December 1, 2014 12:19 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 9:18 am
Veteran BJP leader and Kanpur MP Murli Manohar Joshi, who was associated with the Ram Janmnabhoomi movement, has received an unexpected invitation from a Sunni group to inaugurate an upgraded madrasa in Kanpur and address its students.
According to local BJP leaders, Joshi has accepted the invitation and he would inaugurate the institution during his next visit to the city. Al Jamiat-Ul-Nooria madrasa is located at Noori Road locality, where 60 per cent of the population is Muslim, mostly Sunnis.
According to madrasa authorities, they were giving an opportunity to the senior BJP leader to speak before Muslims and also list the Union government’s plans for the welfare of minorities.
After Joshi received the invitation, BJP’s Kanpur Mahanagar president Surendra Maithani, Cantonment MLA Raghunandan Bhadauriya and Mayor Jagatveer Singh Drona inspected the madrasa campus.
“This was a surprise invitation. For the first time in my political career, Muslims have requested a BJP leader to inaugurate a madarsa. Joshi ji has accepted the invitation… Now, the madrasa is complete and it will be inaugurated when Joshi ji visits Kanpur,” Maithani said.
The madrasa is run by a 10-member committee, all from the Sunni sect. The BJP gets support of Shias in UP elections, but not from Sunnis.
Maqsood Ahmed, a faculty at the madrasa, said the institution has been running for around 15 years, but so far it was offering courses of Fauquania and Tahtania (up to Class VIII). Now, the madrasa has been upgraded to Class X (Munshi and Maulvi).
“We want to get this upgraded madrasa inaugurated by local MP Murli Manohar Joshi ji because he and other BJP leaders often speak from dais that the BJP want development for all. We want him to speak about what the BJP government could do for Muslims,” Maqsood said.
When asked about Joshi’s role in the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, Maqsood said, “What ever has happened is past now. We need to forget that and move forward.”

Dont rush into GM crops field trials:panelWritten by Jay Mazoomdaar | New Delhi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 12:16 am
The government should exercise caution and seek “greater assurance” given the “potential for medium/long-term adverse affects through unprepared introduction of Genetically Modified (GM) food crops”, a high-level committee (HLC) chaired by T S R Subramanian has warned.
“I am not against GM crops but we need to take appropriate caution. All I am saying is that don’t take chances that you cannot undo,” Subramanian told The Indian Express. “Keep your eyes open and check carefully the possible consequences (of field trials) on our biodiversity. European countries are not allowing field trials and they are not idiots.”
Set up to review six green laws, the committee, in its 106-page report submitted to the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) earlier this month, recommended the use of latest technologies to prepare an environmental map of the country that will help assess project proposals objectively and quickly and effectively monitor compliance with conditions imposed for clearances.
But, on page 93, the report cautions that “while utilising science and technology, their limitations as well as the need for appropriate human intervention should not be lost sight of”.
It goes on to say: “The potential consequences of mindless use of science and technology could possibly be illustrated by referring to the potential for medium/long-term adverse affects through unprepared introduction of Genetically Modified (GM) food crops. While other Ministries naturally would aggressively push for early field trials and induction, the role of the MoEF & CC may have to be one of being a Devil’s Advocate to advise due caution.”
Pointing out that Europe does not permit field trials, the report warns that “the average Indian farm is of very small size (which could lead to severe adverse impact on biodiversity through gene-flow)” and that “there are no independent expert agencies in the country”.
Subramanian claimed that his panel sought to improve rather than merely maintain the environmental standards and biological assets of the country. The HLC report envisages a National Environmental Monitoring Authority (NEMA), a statutory body that will prepare an environmental map of the country incorporating details of forest cover, pollution, hydrology, wildlife protected areas, human settlement, eco-sensitive zones, pristine and fragile zones, etc. This, it says, will help lay down a unified, transparent and single-window process for project approvals.
“The mapping may take up to three years but will go a long way in effective environment management. The ground status has to be in the public domain to ensure transparency. Till then, the NEMA will evaluate project proposals case by case and we have recommended geo-referenced maps in 1/50,000 scale available with the Forest Survey of India for the purpose,” said Subramanian.
The committee also proposed the enactment of a new umbrella law — the Environment Law (Management) Act (ELMA) — under which a new appellate board under a retired high court judge will hear appeals related to project clearances. While decisions of this board can be challenged at the National Green Tribunal, the latter will not be able to examine the technical aspects of any project clearance.
“Once something reaches court, continued…

This refers to Maja Daruwala’s ‘Force to service’ (IE, November 26). The writer has made some critical but correct and appropriate observations about the functioning of the Indian police. She has rightly emphasised the need for reforms. Many problems bedevil the Indian police and alienate it from the public. There is a near total absence of human rights awareness in the police. Its failure to treat common people with elementary courtesy is compounded by inefficiency and corruption. Poor representation of women (except in Tamil Nadu) is another serious deficiency. Police leaders must not be worried about the establishment, as enjoined by the Supreme Court, of a “police complaints authority”, which will establish civilian oversight over the police and enhance its credibility. However, no meaningful change can take place unless the police is insulated from extraneous pressure and influence. Constant interference by political bosses in transfers, postings and investigations has made it impossible for upright officers to function impartially and effectively. At present, their political masters are trying to scuttle the reforms directed by the Supreme Court. The prime minister should enact the police bill drafted by the Soli Sorabjee committee for the Union territories at least. This would be a leap forward.

Disband SAARC
SAARC must be disbanded. It is a waste of money and time. It is just another way for our leaders and bureaucrats to enjoy themselves in foreign locations. It is a forum for India-Pakistan one-upmanship. Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif clearly does not want the development of his country or his people. Otherwise, he would have been more cooperative, signed more agreements.

Pondicherry
The 18th Saarc summit was a mixed bag for South Asia. But despite the headline-grabbing posturing of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif, the summit was salvaged by a few positive and progressive steps — the signing of agreements and the assurance that pending ones would be completed soon. All told, the summit should be viewed as part of the new government’s journey towards reshaping and enhancing the potential of South Asia.

Sanskrit all the way
Hindi and Sanskrit are nowhere to be found in the curriculum of German schools. Mandarin rules the roost in the foreign-language category. Spanish is also becoming increasingly popular there. Anyway, it may not be of much use in later life, but Sanskrit is quite popular among Indian students — mainly because it is a subject in which pupils can score well.

I dont enjoy playing disgraceful people as much as heroiconesWritten by Debesh Banerjee | New Delhi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 12:00 am
Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain had a decent opening in the US. Were you aware of this tragedy before getting the script?
We completed the filming five years ago and the film released on November 7 (in the US) close to the 30th anniversary. I was aware about this incident and how it became so tragic, so quickly. Each day the number of victims increased exponentially leading to deaths of men, women and children. There were over 3,000-4,000 fatalities in the first night and now the tragedy has gone into another generation and its effects continue. My hope is that we can increase awareness among people, and urge the government officials and the executives of Dow Chemicals to take responsibility for this tragedy and look at ways of compensating the community.
Did you have any reference point for portraying Warren Anderson?
We had his record of working with Union Carbide. He studied chemical engineering, and had a wife and children. We didn’t want to portray him unjustly, unfairly, or without giving him a chance to defend himself. But he never responded to our requests to meet. When I portrayed him, I wanted to ensure the best parts of his character were defined. He was a charming man and among other things, he was concerned about profit, so much so that when the tragedy occurred, he fled the country. I don’t enjoy playing disgraceful people as much as I enjoy heroic people. You have to enjoy playing people responsibly.
How often do you work with your children?
I am doing the 100th show of Anger Management with my son Charlie (Sheen) when the film premieres in Bhopal on December 3. But one of the most rewarding experiences was with my son, Emilio (Estevez) in 2010 when we acted in The Way. We filmed a pilgrimage through the Camino de Santiago mountains in Spain. With Charlie, the only film I every directed was Cadence in 1990, starring him and my other son Ramon Estevez.
Everybody recalls your role in Wall Street (1987) with Charlie Sheen. Has the acting equation changed between the two of you over the years?
Well one thing is for sure, we both have aged a bit. But I adore him and I love working with him as an actor. He was quite brilliant in Wall Street. And the film was a great experience with Michael Douglas also. It is still viewed as a powerful film about trade unions in America.
Of late you have become more involved with political activism and issues on social justice.
I have been involved with social justice activities for a while now. It is an extension of my upbringing. I like to be involved with fair working practices for labour across America, since I come from a large immigrant family. I am also aware of the women’s rights movement in India to provide clean toilets as a basic necessity. My wife and I believe in this initiative hugely. She stays in touch with continued…

Kings XI Punjab see hike in sponsorship revenue in IPL 8Kings XI Punjab see hike in sponsorship revenue in IPL 8
Vijay C Roy | Chandigarh Nov 30, 2014 08:46 PM IST
On the back of the stupendous performance last season(2014), Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise Kings XI Punjab is confident of registering increase in sponsorship revenue in the upcoming season in 2015 (IPL 8). Kings XI took IPL 7 by storm by finishing runners-up.
" Performance on the field increases your bargaining power. We were runners-up in the seventh edition of the IPL in 2014, this will work in our favour and we hope to clinch some better deals by February next year for the upcoming edition in 2015," said Fraser Castellino, chief operating officer, Kings XI Punjab in an interaction with Business Standard.
"All our sponsorship deals were for one year and we will start the negotiation process very soon. We would negotiate with the existing sponsors of the franchise for CL T20 like Air Asia, HTC Mobiles, Tata Motors Prima, Flying Machine etc," he added. He also expects better ticket sales and significant increase in merchandise sales as a result of better on-the-field performance. IPL cricket franchises' major sources of income are sponsorship fee, merchandise sales and ticket sales while their bulk of expenses include franchise fee to the board, players' cost, etc.
It is worth mentioning that the franchise on the back of brilliant performances turned profitable in the seventh season, in 2014; owner KPH Dream Cricket has reported profit of Rs 78.01 lakh for the first time since the start of the extravaganza in 2008. Castellino also added, "To register profit simply means how you efficiently manage costs and revenue. We managed the players' cost very well last season which worked in favour of us. We spent Rs 43 crore in last season, against the total of Rs 60 crore, which was allowed to us for the acquisition of players."
The team is co-owned by actress Preity Zinta, industrialist Ness Wadia, Mohit Burman and also Karan Paul, chairman of Apeejay-Surrendra Group and Delhi based company Root Investment. Meanwhile the team has collaborated with AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF), the largest global AIDS organisation providing medical care to AIDS affected patients through its India office, registered as India Cares. Castellino shared, "HIV menace has engulfed the State of Punjab significantly due to widespread drug addiction. We have collaborated with AHF India to undertake steps to prevent any further escalation of the drug-HIV epidemic in Punjab and nearby states.
We have also produced a video "Say No To Drugs", which will be disseminated through our digital portals in order to build awareness on this topic. We support AHF's global campaign and believe that greater awareness and testing among these key populations will be required to attain the 2020 goal."

Revival plan of Madras Fertilisers delayed as BRPSE lacks membersRevival plan of Madras Fertilisers delayed as BRPSE lacks members
BS Reporter | Chennai Nov 30, 2014 08:43 PM IST
The revival plan for Madras Fertilizers Ltd (MFL), a sick unit under the Department of Fertilizers, was returned by the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) as several seats, including that of the chairman, remains vacant at the Board for Reconstruction of Public Sector Enterprises (BRPSE), which has to consider and approve the revival plan.
Minister for Chemicals and Fertiliser Hansraj Gangaram  informed the Lok Sabha that “a comprehensive proposal seeking financial restructuring of MFL to address the issue of sickness was submitted to the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) to place it for the consideration/approval of the BRPSE. However, the DPE returned the proposal in July, 2014, stating  the post of Chairman, BRPSE, and several other members are vacant,” said the minister in a written reply.
He stated that the government has laid a roadmap for achieving self-sufficiency in production of the fertiliser by reviving defunct fertiliser units across the country and establishing units along the route of the Natural Gas Grid.
Four of the nine public sector fertiliser companies under the administrative control of the Department of Fertilizers are reported sick, including Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited (FCIL), Hindustan Fertilizer Corporation Limited (HFCL), Madras Fertilizers Limited (MFL), Fertilizers And Chemicals Travancore Ltd. (FACT) and Brahmaputra Valley Fertilizers Corporation Ltd. (BVFCL). Of these, the units of FCIL and HFCL have remained closed from 2002. The MFL, FACT and BVFCL are operational, but sick companies.
The company has proposed a restructuring proposal consisting of waiver of loan worth Rs 554.24 crore as on December, 2013, and outstanding interest worth Rs 331.6 crore along with penal interest till the same period, apart from liberal and flexible government policy.
MFL is a JV between the Government of India and Naftiran Intertrade Co Ltd (NICO) with shareholding of 69.78 per cent and 30.22 per cent respectively.
MFL started incurring losses in 2003-04 and was declared sick in 2009.
The company, which commenced commercial production in 1971, with an annual installed capacity of 247,500 MT of ammonia, 292,050 MT of urea and 540,000 MT of NPK carried out a major revamp in 1998 for Rs 601 crore thus enhancing its annual installed capacity to 346,500 MT of Ammonia, 486,750 MT of Urea and 8,40,000 MT of NPK, according to the department data.
It also says stoppage of subsidy for naphtha-based urea plants from July 1, 2014, is a major strategic issue, having a very high impact on the viability of the MFL plant. Conversion to natural gas feedstock depends upon the availability of LNG at Chennai. At present, the company markets Vijay Organic Manure and Vijay Neem along with bio-fertiliser produced by it.

Rate-sensitive stocks jump ahead of RBI policy next weekReliance MediaWorks sells Big Cinemas to Carnival Films
A fall in international crude prices to four-year lows after Opec left output unchanged has raised expectations of a cut in interest rates by RBI in India. Photo: Bloomberg
Mumbai: Rate-sensitive stocks like those of banks, auto and realty companies were trading higher ahead of the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) monetary policy review on 2 December.
A fall in international crude prices to four-year lows after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) left output unchanged has raised expectations of lower interest rates in India.
The fall in crude prices may help keep inflation and fiscal deficit in check, thereby creating room for rate cuts. Bond prices rallied in response and the benchmark 10-year bond yield fell below 8.1% in morning trade.

The witness who didnt lie and wasnt a racistBy Paul Cassell November 28
In the wake of the Michael Brown grand jury decision, several blog posts (including one by me Wednesday ) have dissected Officer Darren Wilson’s testimony.  Read by itself, different people can draw differing conclusions about whether it is accurate or not.  But what hasn’t been widely discussed is whether the physical evidence confirms or contradicts his story.
Perhaps the reason for this disinterest in the ballistics report, autopsies and other similar information is that for at least some of Brown’s supporters the facts are, apparently, largely irrelevant because Brown is a metaphorical “symbol” of injustice regardless of what actually happened.  A related reason may be that working through this information is time-consuming — and thus beyond the capacity of many commentators.  In contrast, the grand jury painstakingly heard sworn testimony from more than 60 witnesses, which is now collected in several thousand pages of transcripts . Reviewing these transcripts reveals some important and essentially indisputable facts.  And those facts confirm many critical aspects of Wilson’s account.
St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch announced on Monday the grand jury’s decision not to indict officer Darren Wilson for fatally shooting 18-year-old Michael Brown. (AP)
The Washington Post has this extremely helpful graphical presentation of what happened during the shooting, with links to some of the physical evidence in the case.  What follows is my discussion of what appears to be some of the most significant.  To be clear, I do not purport here to completely describe all the forensic evidence and related testimony.  But I will commit to carefully reviewing all of the comments to this post and if anyone points to a significant omission in what I’m describing about the physical evidence — and provides a citation to the volume and page number of the grand jury testimony for that omission — I’ll be glad to consider adding discussion of it.  This post is limited to discussing the physical evidence, as witness testimony cuts in many different directions.
As those who have been following the case closely are aware, Wilson testified before the grand jury that Brown reached for his (Wilson’s) gun and a struggle for the gun followed, during which Wilson fired two shots.  Later, Wilson pursued Brown and, after he turned and then charged toward Wilson, fired multiple shots bringing him to the ground about 8 to 10 feet away from him.
The physical evidence is consistent with his testimony.  The County Medical Examiner was one of the first witnesses to testify before the grand jury.  He explained the autopsy he conducted on Brown. It will be useful to show the injuries discussed and, for these purposes, I insert a chart prepared by an examiner hired by Brown’s family.  (The parallel chart from the ME has not been publicly released, although the ME’s testimony has been released).
 
The ME found a tangential injury on Brown’s right thumb that traveled along the surface of the thumb — grand jury testimony Volume 3 (Sept. 9), page 114, line 12 etc. (hereafter cited by just page and line number).  The ME further explained that he saw what appeared to be “soot” in the wound, which was consistent with a shot from close range (116:22).  Indeed, based on his training and expertise, the ME thought that the soot would be indicative of the gun that fired the bullet causing the wound having been only 6 to 9 inches away (118:12). The soot was consistent with that discharged from a gun (122:13).  The official report from the Office of Medical Examiner later confirmed that “the previously described particles of foreign particulate matter are consistent with products that are discharged from the barrel of a firearm.”
The significance of this wound and related physical evidence is that it places Brown’s right hand within 6 to 9 inches of the barrel of Wilson’s firearm.  This physical evidence is thus quite consistent with Wilson’s testimony that Brown was trying to get hold of Wilson’s weapon, creating a fear in Wilson that he was going to get shot.  It also creates a problem for those who view Brown as having been somehow accosted by Wilson and was just trying to escape.  At least in the theories that I have seen sketched out, no explanation is offered for why Brown (who weighed around 300 pounds) had been forced by Wilson to have his right hand in a position where it was close to the gun  and inside Wilson’s police car.
At some point in the altercation, it appears undisputed that Brown (and his friend Dorian Johnson) ran away from Wilson.  Wilson pursued on foot and, according to Wilson, Brown eventually paused, turned around, and then charged at him.
The ME’s testimony also aligns with Wilson’s testimony on this point.  The ME found various wounds to Brown’s arms, upper torso, and head. Focusing on the head wounds, a detailed report and  summary report from the Office of the Medical Examiner indicated that one wound with an entrance to the vertex of Brown’s  head was “downward and rightward” (detailed report at p. 2) and the wound with an entrance to central forehead was “downward, slightly backward, and rightward” (summary p. 1).  The report also describes the entrance to the wounds on Michael Brown’s chest as “downward” or “slightly downward” (id.).  
The ME explicated these findings at great length to the grand jurors.  He explained that the entry direction for the head wounds, for example, was “slightly downward” (157:6).  The earlier wounds would not have been disabling (151:1) and would not have been disabling in combination, until the final wound to the top of the head (159:15).  In the ME’s opinion, the first wound was the wound to the thumb, the last was the wound to the top of Brown’s head (197:7).  The ME specifically testified that if Brown was bent over, that would be consistent with the entry to the head wounds, although he cautioned that he could not say for certain what position Brown was in at the time he received the wound (166:11).
Perhaps most important, the ME carefully explained how he was able to identify entry points and exit points for the wounds to Brown.  With regard to the wounds on the torso and head, there  were no wounds from the back (197:18).  With regard to the arms, there was only one injury that was from the back — an injury to “the posterior portion of the right forearm” (198:25).  The ME indicated that it is extremely difficult to identify, from bullet wounds, the position of the arms at the time of a shot because “you’ve got . . . an elbow joint, you have a shoulder joint and then the wrist, you have a lot of mobility within that arm and it can be in a lot of scenarios” (133:11).
Here again, this testimony was consistent with Wilson’s testimony. It aligned with Brown charging forward toward Wilson, coming to a halt only when Wilson was able to get a fatal shot to the head.  Significantly, the ME’s testimony did not align with those who claimed (before the grand jury or in the media) the Wilson had gunned Brown down in the back.
The grand jury also heard testimony about a second, independent autopsy performed by an forensic expert hired by the Brown family, Michael Baden. Baden testified that his findings were the same as the ME’s (Vol. 23, at 108:1).   With regard to the thumb wound suffered by Brown, he concluded that the thumb was just a “few inches” away from Wilson’s gun.  He praised the work of a technician who had found in Wilson’s car skin tissue that appeared to be from Michael Brown’s thumb (72:20). Baden also found that Brown’s head was down when the shots were fired (71:2).  (In one curious recent note, the pathology assistant heavily involved with Baden’s work was apparently a fraud, as reported in just the last few days by CNN ).
Baden also discussed the significance of a positive finding from the toxicology report conducted on Brown that came back positive for cannabinoids — specifically, THC in a concentration level that Baden described as “relatively small” (79:11).  Baden did, however, report that “the amount of marijuana that [Brown] has in his system could cause abnormal behavior, but usually doesn’t.  The best indicator of that would be what his behavior was in the time period before . . . Was he walking in the street because of marijuana? That isn’t usually what happens with marijuana, but it could be and it is too variable”  (80:5).
In addition to the autopsy information, the grand jury was also presented with ballistics information.  The crime scene detective presented the location of shell casings and other evidence recovered after the shooting.  The locations of the recovered evidence was also marked, as depicted in the adjacent photograph.
Source: St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office
All of the evidence is conveniently identified on this chart by The Post (developed from a chart presented to the grand jury).
Of particular interest for evaluating Wilson’s testimony is the location of the 12 shell casings recovered.  Two of them were recovered close to Wilson’s car, conforming to his testimony about his firing two shots there (vol. V, 226:4).  After that, the remaining 10 casings were recovered adjacent to (or behind) the path that Wilson said Brown took when charging toward him.  This was consistent with Wilson firing a series of shots as Brown rushed toward him, all the while backpedaling to try and increase the distance.
These are the highlights of the physical evidence that I have reviewed in the case, compared to Wilson’s testimony. Based on my initial read, so far as I can see there are no significant inconsistencies between the physical evidence and Wilson’s grand jury testimony.  Other reviews have likewise not identified readily-apparent examples of problems with Wilson’s testimony.  For example, a review of the grand jury testimony by three Associated Press reporters noted numerous examples of witness statements inconsistent with the physical evidence, but offered no examples from Wilson’s testimony.
The physical evidence is important because, unlike witness testimony, it doesn’t lie and can’t be accused of bias (such as racism).  As the cliche goes, the physical evidence is what it is.  In this case, the physical evidence aligned with Wilson’s testimony.  To be sure, as my co-blogger Orin properly cautioned earlier this week, it is always possible for a potential target in criminal case to lie before a grand jury.  But it is also possible for him to tell the truth.  The grand jury had to sort out these competing possibilities — and the physical evidence gave no reason to doubt Wilson’s testimony.
Update: Several readers have helped me locate some additional, significant evidence confirming that Michael Brown was extremely close to Officer Wilson’s gun.  An expert in DNA from the St. Louis County Police Department Crime Law testified that Michael Brown’s DNA was later found on Wilson’s firearm.   (Vol. 19, 182:16).  It was not possible to determine whether this was due to contact with Brown’s skin, blood, or some other bodily fluid.  The interior left front door panel of Wilson’s car also had DNA from Michael Brown on it (185:9).  On the other hand, the DNA expert did not find Wilson’s DNA on Michael Brown’s shirt (191:15).
Further update: Commenter Mark Spoo, while questioning me about a few of my conclusions, has also helpfully alerted me to this detailed index of the grand jury testimony from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Besides, market regulator SEBI has warned stock exchanges regarding probable inflow of funds from terror groups.
"SEBI maintains constant vigil in the market, and in case of any abnormality, takes appropriate action against the concerned entities," Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha said in a written reply to the Lok Sabha.

In response to a query on whether SEBI has warned bourses regarding probable inflow of terror funds into the market, Sinha replied in the affirmative.
The systems instituted include advanced risk management mechanisms comprising continuous monitoring and surveillance, various limits on positions, margin requirements circuit filters etc.
The systems and practices are reviewed continuously and modified to meet emerging trends.
In addition, SEBI registered intermediaries are required to follow stringent Know Your Client (KYC) norms on an ongoing basis and are also required to file suspicious transaction reports to Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) in case of suspicious activities of their clients, he added.
SEBI circulates all stock brokers, depository participants and mutual funds the updated list of individuals and entities who are subject to various sanction measures, such as freezing of assets/accounts, denial of financial services as provided by the United Nations from time to time.
"Sebi has mandated that intermediaries comply before opening any new client account, the stock broker shall ensure that the name/s of the proposed customer does not appear in the updated list," Sinha said  and added that intermediaries should "continually scan all existing accounts to ensure that no account is held by or linked to any of the entities."
Moreover, the financing operations in the stock markets are through banking channels and the nature of the funds flowing into the stock market would be reflected in the accounts opened with the banks.
Banks and other financial intermediaries have to ensure compliance with enhanced customer disclosure norms as required under Prevention of Money Laundering Act and rules notified there under.
With regards to non-payment of dividend by companies, Sinha said that SEBI has penalised 10 companies in 2012-13, 20 companies in 2013-14 and 61 companies in 2014-15 till October 31, 2014 for non-redressal of investor grievances including for non-payment of dividend.

Trotz not worried about goaltending confidence after 6-2 lossBy Alex Prewitt November 30 Follow @alex_prewitt
(AP Photo/Canadian Press, Darren Calabrese)
TORONTO – Justin Peters parked himself at the end of the Washington Capitals bench, shelved for the interim with a baseball cap on his head. During a first period that ended with two goals allowed against the Maple Leafs, in an arena less than a three-hour drive from his hometown, the backup goaltender had been victimized by self-inflicted error and sheer bad luck, but now he took a seat at his coach’s order.
“We didn’t get any saves and you’re down 2-0,” Coach Barry Trotz said, “so I tried to change a little momentum.”
The move to Braden Holtby in the second period backfired, evidenced by the start of the third when Peters charged from the tunnel first and led his teammates onto the ice, for the final 20 minutes in a night already lost. He finished with three goals allowed, during the first and final frames. Washington’s usual starter, Holtby, faced 12 shots during the middle period and saw three strike the inner netting. For several weeks, the Capitals had enjoyed goaltending stability, mainly thanks to Holtby’s resurgence. Here Friday night, after a 6-2 drive-by pelting steered by Toronto , they would be excused for leaving and wondering if it all just unraveled.
“I can’t worry about their confidence,” Trotz said. “They’re in the National Hockey League level. It’s no different than a player having an off day a little bit. You let it go and regroup and be better the next day.”
For Peters, who did not speak postgame, it marked his fifth straight game starting the tail section of a back-to-back. Over his previous four outings, he had lost three of them. He was signed this summer for two years, $1.9 million, brought aboard as insurance for Holtby, but also as a non-threatening backup option. The Capitals wanted Holtby’s confidence up, and Peters had never logged more than 21 games over his NHL career.
In some of Peters’ earlier starts, he had been hamstrung by teammates’ mistakes, products of the quick turnaround like in Vancouver. At Air Canada Centre Saturday, two fluke deflections on the same shot – both off Capitals – put Peters into an early 1-0 deficit. Later that period, with 23 seconds left before he could escape into the locker room, Peters allowed a power play goal through the five-hole. At intermission, Trotz had seen enough.
“I was hoping to get some momentum off that,” Trotz said. “They scored at the end of the period, then hoping we could get a little momentum, then it didn’t happen.”
Peters’ first appearance with Washington had come during the season’s third game, coincidentally also the last time the Capitals were down two goals at first period’s end, when he replaced Holtby less than 10 minutes after the puck dropped.
Now, as the second period began, Peters watched the lead slip further from control. Twenty-three seconds into the second, with Holtby in goal, Nicklas Backstrom lost the puck at the defensive blue line, Brooks Orpik lost his man at the crease and the Capitals were suddenly down three goals.
It had surprised Holtby when Trotz ordered him into the game, fresh off a strong lockdown of the New York Islanders at home the night before. Later, the course of the second period surprised him even more.
“Most situations you see coming a little bit more than that,” Holtby said. “But that’s not an excuse. Two goals on Petey he had absolutely no chance on. As a goalie not playing, you need to be ready and I don’t think I did a good job of that. Try to swing the momentum. If you get asked to do something, you want to be a part of the solution, and I wasn’t today.”
Holtby still made several bailout saves, the kind which helped turn a 12-goal, three-game slide into a streak of eight straight starts with two or fewer goals allowed in regulation, and the Capitals might have allowed more than a season-high six had Holtby not stood strong. But by the time he left, that regulation streak snapped, defenseman Karl Alzner had missed a back check which led to another Maple Leafs goal, and they added one more on a power play.
“It was a struggle to get through the second period,” Trotz said, so he figured, because Peters hadn’t played in exactly two weeks, to return to the way the night began, with Peters hunched over in goal and Holtby seated on the bench. Peters allowed one more in the third period. In seven games this season, his .872 save percentage is the lowest of his career, 63rd among 67 NHL goaltenders, and his 3.28 goals against average ranks 56th.
“Went into the third,” Trotz said. “I said I’ll put Petey back in, give him some work. He hasn’t had a lot of work.”

Less demand  low price pulls down cotton ginning activityLess demand, low price pulls down cotton ginning activity
Vimukt Dave | Rajkot Nov 30, 2014 08:58 PM IST
India's substantial cotton production this year has not translated into good days for the ginning industry, which is staring at slowdown, on account of subdued demand and disparity in price.
Ginning units, according to industry sources, are running below 65-70 per cent capacity.
Moreover, expecting higher price for their produce, farmers are reluctant to sell kapas (raw cotton) at the current prices, bringing down the commodity's arrival by 50 per cent from last year.
"There is no export demand currently and price disparity is ranging from Rs 1,000-Rs 1,200 per candy at the current price level. Consequently, most of the ginning units are running below their capacity by 65 to 70 percent," said Dilip Patel, president, All Gujarat Cotton Ginners' Association (AGCGA). Price of cotton is ruling between Rs 33,000-Rs 33,500 per candy (a candy is 355 kg) in Gujarat while raw cotton is trading at Rs 800-Rs 850 per 20 kg. Daily arrival in Gujarat is reported to be around 30,000-32,000 bales (a bale of 170 kg), considerably down from last year's 65,000 bales.
Cotton Corporation of India (CCI), a government-owned agency under the Union ministry of textiles, is purchasing cotton from farmers at minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 4,000 per quintal, a price level not viable for ginners.
Arvind Raichura of Rajkot-based Balkrishna Ginning said, "Right now, domestic yarn mills are buying based on their requirements. Export purchase in market is very nominal and the principal reason behind slowdown in ginning activity."
AGCGA met Union minister of state for agriculture Mohan Kundariya last week and submitted a memorandum seeking five per cent incentive to boost exports.
Patel said, "Once export increases from India, it will improve market demand and price will also go up. In that scenario, CCI won't need to buy cotton as farmers will get better price for their commodity."
CCI, according to Patel, is losing nearly Rs 5,000 per candy, thereby burdening the government exchequer. But, if five per cent export incentive is given, government will have to pay only Rs 1,250 per candy to exporters, Patel said.

We will seal illegal migrant routes: Modiinternational relations
Land swap pact with Dhaka will be the solution, says the Prime Minister
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday announced that his government would utilise the land transfer agreement with Bangladesh in a manner that might seem to be an immediate loss to Assam but serve the security interests of the State in the long term.
Addressing Bharatiya Janata Party workers at the Sarusajai Stadium here, Mr. Modi said his government would utilise the agreement to seal all routes across the international border through which “illegal” Bangladeshi immigrants had been entering Assam and creating havoc in the State.
“There will be no compromise on security,” he said. “I know the sentiments of the people. We will always protect the interests of Assam and the country.”
CM stand
Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi has been critical of both the BJP and the Asom Gana Parishad for opposing the land swap deal signed by the previous United Progressive Alliance government with Bangladesh.
He has maintained that Assam will not lose land as projected by the two parties.
Mr. Modi, in his speech, warned the forces trying to harm the interests of Assam and the northeast. “Such forces should know that the government has changed in Delhi and the law will not spare them now,” he said. “The development of the entire northeast region, including Assam, is a priority for his government.”
The BJP, he said, had compelled all political parties to make development the prime issue instead of issues of caste and region. “We have turned the issue of development into an agenda of the country.”
Jan Dhan Yojana
Mr. Modi said his government had directed banks to serve the interests of the poor people under the Jan Dhan Yojana.
Over the past six decades, only one crore bank accounts were opened each year. Now, under the new scheme, one crore bank accounts were being opened every week.

New Delhi: Delhi Police are yet to make any headway in the daring ATM heist in North Delhi in which a security guard was killed, even as investigations reveal glaring security lapses on part of the cash replenishment agency.
Although police has so far questioned more than 100 people including the remaining staff of the cash van, locals and other employees of the cash replenishment agency but they have not achieved a breakthrough as yet.
As many as 10 teams are working to crack the case, including the Special Cell and Crime Branch.

Most of the CCTVs in the area could not capture the incident and the only footage available to the police are the one from the camera inside the Citibank ATM and the second which was shot by a student from his mobile phone.
"The CCTV footage of inside the ATM shows lapse on part of custodians as they did not send out the two customers who were already inside the ATM. In the footage there are around five persons present inside the ATM including the guard," a police official said.
According to the police, there is a standard operating procedure (SOP) for carrying large amount of cash for ATM refilling which was not followed by the company Scientific Systems Management Services.
"The biggest blunder was that two customers remained inside the ATM booth when the two custodians went in with the suitcase to refill the machine with cash. They were there when the loot actually took place. The shutter of the ATM has to be lowered while the cash is filled into it but this too was not followed," the official added.
Investigators are also trying to draw a parallel with a similar robbery that took place in Gurgaon few days back.
"The modus operandi in that robbery was the same as the robbers had shot at the security guard. In fact, they had also used the same Pulsar 220 CC bike in that robbery which was used in yesterday's incident. We are studying the CCTV footage of the Gurgaon heist to see if we can find any clues in it," a senior official privy to the investigations said.
The attackers had used .32 bore bullets which was recovered from the deceased guard's body.
According to the police, the incident took place near North Campus of Delhi University around 11 AM on Saturday when two custodians of the cash van, belonging to a private cash replenishment company, were in the process of refilling money into a Citibank ATM machine at Bungalow Road.

A rate cut would be against odds  but likelihood is risingA rate cut would be against odds, but likelihood is rising
Devangshu Datta | New Delhi Nov 30, 2014 10:37 PM IST
The correlation between growth in gross domestic product (GDP) and broad stock market returns isn't strong. The best illustration of this is a comparison of Chinese GDP growth with the movement in the Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP). Since 2004, the SHCOMP has lost an absolute 19 per cent, despite the Chinese economy seeing consistently high GDP growth during this period.
In earlier eras, when moving capital across economies wasn't easy, stock market analysts said investment based purely on interest rates gave better results than tracking GDP growth trends. If rates were low or heading low, the market would be liable to go up. Conversely, if rates were high or headed there, the market would be liable to fall.
In a closed economy, this is easy to understand. First, returns from the stock market are directly comparable to debt returns and if debt returns drop, money is more likely to flow to equity. Second, liquidity depends on rates and low rates are usually associated with high liquidity. The higher the liquidity, the greater the likelihood of money flowing into stocks.
In a globalised economy, however, exchange rates also become important, as money can be moved easily and liquidity isn't dependent on domestic interest rates. So, in a modern open economy, analysts believe interest rates and exchange rates are two key variables that help predict stock market trends with some reliability.
Obviously, the two sets of rates are connected and variations in one can lead to changes in the other. In theory, an exchange rate should reflect differences in inflation and real interest rates between two freely traded currencies. If one currency can be converted into the other and one of the interest rates can be captured easily, the exchange rate should automatically discount real interest rates in both economies. In practice, however, the exchange rate will be influenced by expectations of changes in interest rates.
For the rupee, with currency controls, this conversion mechanism is imperfect. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) can keep rates where it wants to, through intervention if necessary. RBI looks at currency flows in both directions, external balance of payments, trade trends, etc, and sets a band in which it wants the rupee to be traded. That band will also be influenced by cross currency rates. Right now, every major currency appears to be easing against the dollar. The yen has fallen to multi-year lows and the euro is weak. The Chinese, who maintain a currency peg to the dollar, have just cut interest rates and that means the yuan might also ease against the dollar.
There are signs the rupee might end up being too strong against the dollar by default. If that happens, the country's current account deficit will increase because imports will rise and exports fall. In October, exports declined, after rising for several months in succession. Strong buying by foreign institutional investors is also tending to push the rupee up.
Under these circumstances, RBI might be looking to pull the rupee down slightly. Typically, the central bank is wary about weakening the currency because India has to import 80 per cent of its crude oil requirements. But oil prices are headed to multi-year lows and this might provide RBI the courage to weaken the rupee and push exports.
There are several ways in which the rupee can be held down. For instance, RBI might buy dollars, pushing the rupee down quickly, but not necessarily holding it down in sustained fashion. Or, it could cut domestic policy rates at its monetary policy review on Tuesday. A rate cut would change real interest rate equations and, consequently, lead to a lower rupee.
If RBI does tinker with the exchange rate, it will inevitably impact the stock market. A rate cut is likely to strengthen the bull run because it will be a positive surprise. As of now, the consensus is RBI will not cut policy rates on Tuesday.
But a rapid fall in crude oil prices has meant RBI is a year ahead of its schedule in inflation-targeting. It had targeted holding retail inflation to eight per cent by January 2015 and under six per cent by January 2016. Retail inflation is already under six per cent.
Though a rate cut is against the odds, its likelihood is increasing.

Obamas crown ofthornsWritten by Prem Shankar Jha |
Posted: December 1, 2014 12:48 am
Two events in the past month have shaken the foundations of American foreign policy. In late October, just as the US Congressional election results confirmed that the Republican Party had seized the Senate, news leaked that President Barack Obama had written a private letter to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei of Iran, urging him to conclude the much-awaited nuclear agreement as speedily as possible. And on November 24, he virtually dismissed his defence secretary, Chuck Hagel.
Neither the White House nor Hagel has cited reasons for his exit, but it is apparent that it was over serious differences on how to conduct the war on ISIS — the renegade self-styled Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. No one has been able to figure out what these differences were. Many possibilities have been aired in the American media, but the trigger almost certainly was a memo sent to the White House sometime in October, in which Hagel criticised the administration’s Syria policy for, as the New York Times put it, “failing to connect the campaign against the Islamic State to a broader struggle against President Bashar al-Assad of Syria”.
Hagel may not have known that Obama had written to Khamenei. But if he did, his memo would have amounted to an ultimatum demanding that the US commit itself irrevocably to a war on Assad, in addition to the ISIS. Had Obama agreed, it would have brought his ongoing negotiations with Iran to an abrupt end. Reconciling the US’s commitment to destroying ISIS with its commitment to end the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran requires decisions that only the president can make. Whether he intended it or not, Hagel’s memo, therefore, crossed a genuine red line.
Hagel’s request for a clear commitment to fight both Assad and the ISIS is understandable. The US is being drawn steadily deeper into another war in Iraq. That war cannot be won without sending in ground troops to recapture and hold the ground currently occupied by the ISIS. With Iraq’s army in a shambles and the US and EU reluctant to commit their own troops to another bloody conflict, these can only come from either Syria and Iran, or Turkey. Since Obama has publicly ruled out cooperation with Syria and Iran, that has left only Turkey.
But Turkey’s cooperation is only available at a price. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is prepared to join the battle only if the US commits itself to ridding Syria of the Assad regime as well, and has resorted to obstruction bordering on blackmail to force the US to agree. Turkey has stalled coalition attempts to use its air force bases and forced aircraft continued…

Indian diaspora vulnerable to jihadi movements: IBchiefWritten by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati |
Posted: December 1, 2014 12:48 am
The Indian diaspora is becoming increasingly vulnerable to rising global Islamic terrorism and it is time to mount massive efforts to ensure that Indian youth are not lured into it, Intelligence Bureau director Syed Asif Ibrahim said Sunday at 49th All India Conference of DGPs and IGPs in Guwahati.
“With a large number of youth from over 80 countries getting attracted to the ISIS, the Indian diaspora is becoming increasingly vulnerable. It is true that some Indian youth have also been lured, but there number is very low. But, the threat is likely to increase,” Ibrahim said.
The IB chief also expressed concern over the possible impact of a glamourised image of ISIS on a section of Indian youth. “This and al-Qaeda activities have the potential of creating a jihadi mindset among a section of youth in India. This has to be countered,” he said.
Ibrahim also said India should seek cooperation in intelligence sharing with neighbouring countries like Nepal, Myanmar, Saudi Arabi and Malaysia to counter the growing menace of Islamic terror.
“Prominent members of social organisations, clerics and seminaries have already condemned jihadi activities in India as un-Islamic. We now need to formulate a collective response involving community leaders to reject all kinds of jihadi propaganda,” Ibrahim said.
Referring to terror groups using neighbouring countries’ soil to target india, the IB chief said while Pakistan-sponsored terror is well-known, detection of a Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) module in West Bengal has showed that India is on the target of other terror groups too.

Ex-AAP man to lead BJP charge againstKejriwalWritten by Pragya Kaushika | New Delhi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 12:45 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 3:26 pm
To counter the Aam Aadmi Party’s campaign strategy, where in the party is going to highlight achievements during its 49-day government, the Delhi BJP has decided to prepare a “chargesheet” against Arvind Kejriwal’s claims.
With the help of this document, the BJP aims to puncture AAP’s claims that it lived up to its poll promises by slashing water and electricity rates in the national capital.
Heading the team is former AAP member Ashwani Upadhyay who recently joined the BJP and was appointed as its spokesperson. While eyebrows were raised on his appointment, senior leaders of the Delhi BJP believe that he has been appointed to play a crucial role in attacking the AAP on its  claims of fulfilling promises.
Sources in the BJP said the party has provided Upadhyay with the resources he will need to attack the AAP and its 49-day “misrule” in Delhi.
“While BJP leaders focus on how Kejriwal abandoned Delhi to pursue his dream of becoming the prime minister, a unit will counter claims of his achievements in a logical manner. Countered with facts at district and state level, the AAP will soon lose its credibility. We will bring out the truth before the people of Delhi,” a senior leader said.
Sources said Updhyay and other founder members will make “stark revelations” about AAP’s functioning and its sources of funds in a phased and strategic manner.
For senior leaders, the AAP is still a threat in many Assembly constituencies and the BJP is not taking it lightly, as it did in the last elections. “We are fully prepared. We will expose Kejriwal. He made false statements on his government’s achievements . We will launch a counter attack on their ‘achievements’ soon,” a senior leader said.

Seven hurt  some may be trapped in Ghaziabad wallcollapseBy: Express News Service | Ghaziabad |
Posted: December 1, 2014 12:39 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 12:42 am
The scaffolding of an under construction factory in Ghaziabad collapsed on Sunday evening, leaving at least seven labourers injured.
Ghaziabad police said there had been no casualties so far, but there was a chance that more people were trapped under the rubble. Till late at night, teams of NDRF and Ghaziabad police continued their search operations.
Dharmender Yadav, senior superintendent of police (Ghaziabad), said, “The incident took place around 7.30 pm in Tronica City industrial area. The owner of the plot, who is a resident of Shahdara in Delhi, was in the process of setting up the factory and labourers had erected a scaffolding. While it is unclear why it fell, it may be because the cement had not set properly.”
Yadav said so far seven people had been rushed to hospital, while three others managed to escape relatively unhurt.
“The owner has told us that except for one person, everybody else in his employment has been rescued. However, there is still a chance that others might be trapped inside and our team as well as NDRF personnel are carrying out search and rescue operations,” he said.

Delhi Confidential: In ministers praiseNew Delhi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 12:38 am
At the first National Awards for Innovations in Educational Administration Saturday, one of the awardees, while making some observations from the dais, concluded his remarks by telling HRD Minister Smriti Irani that people had so far seen her as “Sita Mata” on a TV show but now want her to become “Shiksha Mata” (Mother of Education). The remark drew a loud applause from the audience and led Irani to mention it in her address. But that was not all. As if in response to the remarks made by an earlier speaker who had harped on endlessly about Irani having achieved so much at such a young age, she said, “Today, I realised that I am not that old as I look on TV.”
PATIENCE PAYS
The wait was long but seems to be worth it. The new Minister of State for Home, Haribhai Parthibhai Chaudhary, has finally been allocated work and has got quite a meaty profile. He has been asked to handle the two divisions of Internal Security as well as the one dealing with Left-Wing Extremism. Earlier, these divisions were being directly handled by Home Minister Rajnath Singh. The other MoS, Kiren Rijiju, will look after Northeast and Border Management divisions.
CREATING A BUZZ
All the talk on Ganga has surely generated some interest in the cleaning exercise that the government has undertaken. At least, among the MPs. Ahead of the winter session of Parliament, the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation received more than 150 questions from MPs seeking information on the various activities of Clean Ganga Mission.
LACKLUSTRE AFFAIR
The DGPs’ conference organised by IB turned out to be a lacklustre affair for many officers who attended it. Besides being organised in Guwahati for the first time, the conference for the first time also did not have presentation from individual police organisation. Some officials said it was poorly managed with very little information to go back with.
JUMPING THE QUEUE
In Nepal, when SAARC leaders went to the hill resort at Dhulikhel, they did not travel by road, but flew in choppers. And, host Nepal organised their arrival as per alphabetical order of the name of countries. So, Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani was the first to reach, followed by Bhutan’s PM Tsering Tobgay. India, however, seemed to have jumped the queue as Narendra Modi reached third, followed by others. Sheikh Hasina was the only one who could not go to Dhulikhel, since she was not well.

Robert Griffin III and Jay Gruden dominate the discussion on NFL pregame showsBy Scott Allen November 30 Follow @ScottSAllen
(Via NFL Network)
Predictably, there was a lot of talk about the Redskins on Sunday’s national pregame shows. Predictably, almost none of it concerned how Colt McCoy matched up against the Indianapolis defense, or whether the Washington pass rush could get pressure on Andrew Luck. Rather, there was much debate about Robert Griffin III’s future, if any, in Washington and Jay Gruden’s decision to bench him.
“I’m told by Redskins sources they have not given up on RGIII,” NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported after four out of five co-hosts on ‘NFL GameDay’ said it was too early to label Griffin a bust. “In fact, there’s a possibility he could return to the lineup this year if Colt McCoy does falter. But the Redskins coaches I’ve talked to [say] that RGIII needs a little bit of a mental reset. They think he does have the skills to be a starting quarterback, maybe not the running ability that he had earlier in his career just because of the injuries, but he certainly does have enough talent to be a starter. But they think he needs to stand on the sidelines and watch and try to reset his brain to start making the football decisions that he did earlier in his career.”
Meanwhile, on CBS Sports Network’s “That Other Pregame Show,” Jason La Canfora said “people in that building do not believe [Griffin] will be back in 2015.” No one, it seems, can agree on whether Griffin will return to the Redskins next year.
“I don’t see how Daniel Snyder, the owner of the Redskins, can help but feeling burned given where RGIII is now,” Michael Silver said on NFL Network. “When they made the trade, they gave up a lot, but remember, as a rookie, this guy wasn’t just good, he wasn’t just promising; he was terrific. Not just running the ball; throwing it accurately, getting that team to the playoffs. And so do you give up on that? Even though it’s been bad coming off the knee injury, even though clearly the coach you’ve hired has not loved you, do you give up on that? I think it is too tough to call. I don’t believe RGIII is out of chances in the NFL. It is possible that Daniel Snyder will elect to move on. I think they probably will try to salvage it one more time.”
“I think it is the end of his time in Washington,” Kurt Warner said. “You know, he was so good his first year. And even impressed me with his accuracy down the field, his ability to make all the throws. But what’s different now is the system’s different. They’re asking him to see the field. And that’s the biggest question for me, it’s not physically can he make the throws and can he be accurate; it’s can he develop into that pocket passer, and it seems like Washington says that’s what we want, we want a pocket passer that can read coverages and play the game the way Gruden wants to play the game, so I believe it’s best for him to go somewhere else and try to find something that fits him better.”
“This is not a match made in heaven with the coach and quarterback and the system and all that sort of thing,” Steve Mariucci said. “He’s got to stay ready, because he’s one play away from being back in there playing for these guys and finishing the season. But I too think he needs to start someplace else and get a fresh start like Alex Smith did, and all of a sudden it’s a win-win situation. Maybe it’s his home state of Texas, I don’t know, Dallas or Houston. Maybe it’s the Eagles and they come out and they run that zone-read exclusively with RGIII, that’s what he does best. He needs a new start. But stay ready. There’s five games left.”
Later, Marshall Faulk questioned Gruden’s decision to go to McCoy with five games left, and Silver questioned Gruden’s own future in D.C.
“If you are trying to find out what you have in RGIII, let him play this out,” Faulk said. “Go through the struggles, and hope the people around him play better, and evaluate them. Because we know who Colt McCoy is. C’mon guys. We saw Colt McCoy in Cleveland. We know who Colt McCoy is. Is Colt McCoy your future quarterback?”
“Part of the problem is that we have an owner who has shown the quarterback too much support,” Silver said. “So I wonder, is Jay Gruden a one and done coach if it comes down to it? You mentioned Alex Smith. That guy endured about five benchings and lived on, but that’s an anomaly.”
“The only time we say an owner is showing too much support is when you start losing,”Michael Irvin said. “When RGIII was winning, he’s treating him like a franchise quarterback.”

Former Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw talked about what it’s like to be benched on “Fox NFL Sunday.”
“I’ve always said that you grow and learn by playing,” Bradshaw said. “And then there comes a point where your play is so bad you hit the bench. I did it, so did Robert. Now, while you’re over there, what do you do? Do you pout? Do you feel sorry for yourself? Surely, you’re devastated, you’re embarrassed. But you’ve gotta be honest with yourself. Exactly why am I over here? What can I do to get myself back out on that field? Whatever it is, you do it, whether it’s studying more. You have to be honest with yourself. I used anger as my way of getting back. I was mad. Not at the fans and the coach, but at myself, too, for putting myself in that position.”
Co-host Howie Long suggested that Griffin’s success as a rookie was because of the system he was in.
“As hard as this is to believe, I think this year has left RGIII longing for Mike and Kyle Shanahan,” Long said. “He just doesn’t fit this offense. They tailored the offense, accommodation of their zone sweep, and the read-option. Whatever team picks him up is going to have to tailor their offense, to a certain extent, to RGIII. But he’s going to have to find a way to stay healthy. How does he stay healthy? Well, the first thing I’d do is put together cut-ups of about 400 of Russell Wilson’s plays. This style of playing, as a mobile quarterback, keeps you playing week to week.”
Long doesn’t think Griffin has a future in Washington, while Jimmie Johnson questioned whether he has a future anywhere.
“I said a long time ago he’s done in Washington,” Johnson said. “He does not fit this offense, plus I have no confidence that he’s going to stay healthy in any offense.”
(Via ESPN)
And in a silly segment on ESPN’s “NFL Countdown” “Mad Money’s” Jim Cramer said Andrew Luck’s a buy, buy, buy and Griffin’s a sell, sell, sell.
“How ‘bout RGIII?” Cramer said. “Here’s a quarterback that from the get-go looked like an Amazon, unstoppable, fabulous scrambler with a read-option, not unlike Kindle. But the hits, the Washington organization, the dreaded drop-back, and now even the out-of-the-closet criticism by coach Gruden have me thinking that sure, Griffin’s a retailer, but it turns out he might be Sears.”

Sebi fines SBI  ICCI  4 other merchant banks for disclosure lapses in CAREIPOSpiceJet shares continue to plunge; down 17 pct
In a major clampdown for “suppression of material facts” in IPO documents, Sebi today penalised merchant banking arms of SBI, ICICI, Kotak Mahindra, IDBI, DSP Merrill Lynch and Edelweiss groups for lapses during the public offer of rating agency CARE two years ago.
The six merchant banks have been asked to pay a fine of Rs 1 crore — the maximum penalty applicable for violation of disclosure related norms in IPO documents — within 45 days.
Taking a strong view about the violation of Sebi norms as also the Code of Conduct for merchant banks and book-running lead managers (BRLMs) for public issues, Sebi said in its 86-page order: “While making disclosures in the Red Herring Prospectus, the BRLMs cannot pick and choose some material facts that they prefer to disclose and suppress some material facts.
“If material facts are suppressed or distorted as in the extant case, the very safety and integrity of the securities market would become a cause of concern for the regulators and the investors.”
The IPO came in December 2012, prior to which these six bankers had filed a Red Herring Prospectus for the public issue involving sale of nearly 72 lakh shares.
In this case, the bankers had made disclosure of one of the conditions under the FDI route in the RHP, terming it as “a material disclosure” because CARE had specifically sought such approval from RBI.
At the same time, they omitted the disclosure of another condition applicable to the Offer under the FDI route (though the compliance of the same was specifically directed by RBI while granting exemption to non-resident investors participating in the Offer) by unilaterally assuming the non-applicability of the said condition.
The proposed IPO of CARE (Credit Analysis and Research Ltd) was through the offer for sale route.
It was observed that CARE had received a letter in September 2012 from the RBI agreeing to exempt non-resident investors participating in the offer for sale, from the requirement of obtaining a No Objection Certificate from their respective regulators.
One of the conditions stipulated by RBI while exempting non-resident investors participating in the offer from obtaining NoCs was that the minimum capitalisation norms applicable to Non Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) are strictly adhered to by CARE.
Subsequently, CARE had written to RBI stating that investment by Foreign Institutional Investors, NRIs and Qualified Foreign Investors in the offer would not be foreign direct investment (FDI).
It has also said that relevant regulations and the conditions applicable for FDI including minimum capitalisation norms prescribed would not be applicable to the company in respect of the offer.
The market regulator observed that CARE and the merchant bankers had proceeded with the issue in the absence of any response from RBI and that limited disclosures were made in the prospectus.
According to Sebi, the disclosure in the RHP did not mention the conditional nature of the exemption granted by RBI to the non-resident investors.
The market regulator noted that “it was only since RBI on the penultimate day of the closing of CARE’s Offer for Sale permitted six months time to CARE to comply with the minimum capitalisation norm and further granted extension up to September 30, 2013, the FIIs who participated in the Offer prior to the issue of the addendum by the BRLMs did not end up contravening FEMA [Foreign Exchange Management (Transfer of Issue of Security by a Person Resident Outside India) Regulations]”.
It added: “Nevertheless, this cannot undermine the act of the BRLMs to misrepresent/ suppress material facts in the prospectus with respect to RBI’s letter dated September 26, 2012 to CARE, which was against the interest of the non- resident investors participating in the Offer.”

I m Amit Shah: BJP chief dares Mamata on her home turfComments
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) launched a scathing attack on West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata on Sunday, laying the foundation for the 2016 assembly elections in the state where the saffron party is eyeing substantial gains.
Echoing Narendra Modi's call for a Congress-free India, BJP president Amit Shah called for a Trinamool-free Bengal, addressing a public rally at Kolkata on Sunday. (ANI Photo)
Addressing a rally that saw a crowd of two lakh people, BJP national president Amit Shah attacked Banerjee over the Saradha case, terrorist activities as well as lack of development in the state.
"If you vote for a BJP government, we will ensure prosperity and take the state forward," Shah told the people of Bengal.
"A few days ago, Mamata Banerjee had asked: who is Amit Shah?  I am Amit Shah… I have come here to start the process of uprooting Trinamool Congress," he added, calling for a 'Trinamool-free Bengal', in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's slogan of a 'Congress-free India'.
Shah pointed out that throwing out the ruling party from the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) polls in 2015 can be the first step towards that “dream”.
The BJP chief's address came at a time when the ruling Trinamool Congress was reeling under graft allegations in the multi-crore Saradha chit fund scam and the October 2 blasts that killed two alleged militants from Bangladesh who had taken shelter in Burdwan.
"Stop protecting Bangladeshis," Shah told Banerjee, "Don't jeopardise the security of the state and the country."
Turning the heat on the state government over the blasts, he added, "Who is Hasan Chowdhury? Mamata Banerjee, please tell the people of Bengal who he is."
Chowdhury owned the two-storey house in Burdwan where a group of alleged Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh operatives were hiding. He is known to be a Trinamool worker.
Exuding confidence about BJP's poll prospects, Shah said, "Maharastra and Haryana have already voted for a BJP government. Jharkhand and J-K will certainly vote for BJP governments."
Shah added the Trinamool had failed to usher in development in Bengal, which is not known for an industry-friendly image.
"Many big industries have shut operations in West Bengal, the youth are unemployed and the... infrastructure is poor."
Reaching out to the youth, Shah said youngsters in Bengal wanted that the Burdwan terrorists be hanged and the Saradha culprits be sent behind the bars.
"I am challenging Mamata Banerjee to declare that those arrested by CBI in the Saradha scam are innocent," the BJP president added.
Trinamool MP Sinjoy Bose and suspended party MP Kunal Ghosh have been arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation in connection with the Saradha case that has sent a shock wave across the nation.
"Mamata Banerjee staged a big demonstration against the Singur factory (of Tata's Nano) that had affected about 1,200 people… But why is she silent about the Saradha scam that has affected 17 lakh people?"
The shadow of Saradha has been hounding Banerjee and her government since it exploded in early 2013. Kunal Ghosh had recently said Banerjee was the biggest beneficiary of the scam. 
"West Bengal needs a government that fights against corruption and does not protect people involved in scams," Shah said.
"The journey of Modiji's victory chariot flagged off in 2014 will come to Kolkata," he added at the rally, for which he was initially denied permission by the Trinamool government.
BJP state leaders had to move Calcutta high court thrice to obtain permission to organise it after the Kolkata Police, KMC and fire services department said no.
The BJP's rise in Bengal has sparked speculations about new equations in Bengal's political arena where the saffron brigade was a fringe player till recently.
However, banking on Modi's poll promises on development, the party bagged an impressive 16.8% vote share in the April-May Lok Sabha elections. Even though the BJP won just two of the 42 seats, it made an impact.
Frequent clashes between BJP and Trinamool supporters have been reported in Bengal since the polls.

Will swap land with Dhaka  end illegal influx  says PMPrime Minister Narendra Modi said that his government would go ahead with a land transfer deal with Bangladesh keeping illegal influx and Assam’s long-term security interests in mind.
 
Bangladesh stands to gain some 10,000 acres of land through this deal the UPA government had initiated in 2011 and placed as a bill for ratification in Rajya Sabha in December last year. The BJP in Assam had opposed this deal, as did the Trinamool Congress in West Bengal.
Addressing party workers in Guwahati on Sunday, Modi said, “The land swap deal will be beneficial. It might seem to be an immediate loss for Assam, but it will serve security interests in the long term and help solve the problem of Bangladeshi migrants.”
Infiltration from Bangladesh is a major issue in the Northeast. It is viewed as a demographic invasion designed to out-populate scores of indigenous communities in the region.
 
The Prime Minister said there would be no compromise with the security of the strategic Northeast. “The forces trying to destabilise Assam and the Northeast should know that Delhi has a new government and the law will not spare them now,” he said.
Insisting that the BJP brand of politics was not based on casteism, communalism or regionalism, Modi said his party believes in nationalism. “Our mantra of inclusive development has compelled all political parties to rework their agendas,” he said, adding that his government has special plans for the Northeast.

Dream of success  in picturesTotal customer base: 3 million (ZoomIn & Photojojo combined)
 
Revenue: Target revenue is Rs 180 crore this financial year, with 50 per cent year-on-year growth
"The way I see it, Facebook and other similar sites are about chronicling. ZoomIn is about storytelling," said Rao.
Founded in 2008, ZoomIn specialises in digital photo personalisation and printing. Its unique product, the photo book, accounts for 70 per cent of its business, according to Rao.
But in India, this product poses a challenge, as most people haven't experienced it at all. "Here, most people talk about the wedding photo album," said Rao.
The photo book offers various formats in which pictures are arranged in a manner to provide a coherent narrative. For this, ZoomIn's main target is the "chief memory officers" of families, that is, the mothers. Be it a child's first birthday or the time when they lost their first tooth - mothers want to capture all such moments in pictures so that they can revisit these again and again.
"When you have kids involved, people are more likely to get a photo book made as it keeps them more in touch with grandparents or relatives, as compared to sharing pictures on Facebook," said Sandeep Murthy, a partner at Lightbox Ventures - the lead financier for ZoomIn.
Photojojo acquisition and Phoneography
ZoomIn acquired San Francisco-based Photojojo, which sells cameras and mobile accessories, in a bid to realise the potential of mobile photography.
In a niche business, it is essential to have content and community driving the commerce, not deals, claimed Rao.
By tying up with Photojojo, ZoomIn has access to a large community as well as to unique content and products. Photojojo's business specifically targets the phoneography segment.
"Most of the story-telling is happening on the phone. That's called phoneography, not photography. We want more of that space. We'll help you tell your story through your phone."
The acquisition helped ZoomIn gain a global footprint, which will help it differentiate itself from the competition through its products.
Murthy said, "The Indian market allows economies of cost and production, helping a business venture into other markets. ZoomIn is poised to enter markets in Australia and Singapore."
Business model
Rao said ZoomIn helps you tell your story. "We help you celebrate the moments that make up your story," said Rao.
Photojojo helps ZoomIn achieve this aim by providing a wider audience. ZoomIn has its own printing infrastructure, with all processes being conducted in-house.
Printing the photo book and selling camera and mobile accessories is the main revenue source for ZoomIn.
"ZoomIn and Photojojo combined have about three million customers at present. We have almost 60,000 'likes' on Facebook," said Ajay Menon, chief operating officer, ZoomIn.
It is targeting revenue of Rs 180 crore this financial year, with a 50 per cent year-on-year growth.
But ZoomIn is more than its finances.
Murthy said he and Rao have been working together for six to seven years, since 2007-2008. "The real value of ZoomIn is its team and how they have evolved with the market," he said, adding that though ZoomIn began by selling cameras to establish a relationship with customers, it soon realised that mobile phone were the way ahead.
ZoomIn's business has an inherent "social" aspect to it, as its products are sold through a cellphone app, and its primary content - photos - can be shared. Photos, with their virality element, reduce customer acquisition cost.
How? "Just take a photo and share it," said Murthy.
Challenges
Photo books have caught on in the US, but in India, it's still a fuzzy concept. Customer education and providing products priced for the Indian market are the main challenges the company has faced.
Reach was another hurdle that the ZoomIn team had to overcome. "Most of the chief memory officers - the mothers - were not online," said Rao.
So, he and his team began by exploring the offline retail space. A tie-up with bookstore chain Crossword helped educate customers.
"Once people saw the product, they wanted it," said Rao. "We tried to get our product into as many hands as possible and offered free trials."
Now, the target customers are being approached on the phone.
"Moving from one market to another is challenging but the team has the experience of working together and that has helped it," said Murthy.
Road ahead
Rao said his company's focus is to expand the Indian market and take a leadership position, while also focussing on the international market.
Localising is a major challenge but in the international market, there is still some competition. Shutterfly in the US and Photobox in the UK are two examples.
"What we're trying to do is differentiate ourselves by creating unique products and curating specific categories," said Rao.
India, on the other hand, is still a new market, with smaller local players. So ZoomIn has a monopoly.
"I don't think there's any other company addressing the specific need that we are and doing it at this scale. There are lots of people who try to just create apps, not a business. It requires a lot of infrastructure. ZoomIn has raised over $22 million," said Rao.
Innovation of products and differentiation lead the way forward for ZoomIn in both the Indian and the international markets.
EXPERT TAKE
Personalisation has become important with the evolution of digital technology and a shift in customer expectation for customisation, spurring new business and erasing traditional economies of cost. ZoomIn was an early mover. Without restricting itself to only photo printing - which is quickly becoming a commoditised service - it has successfully expanded its portfolio with products such as photo books and calendars. The website is easy to use (most Indians are first-time online designers); the core focus is on quality and service; and the brand projects itself as sharing an emotional bond with its potential customer base.
It is likely to face two big challenges: Given the niche nature of the service and the limited product set, ZoomIn might find it difficult to scale-up. Also, this business - which doesn't require a significant capex - doesn't have any entry barriers. So, ZoomIn will have to explore multiple content and products. Also, it has to keep itself distinguished through innovative technology-driven platforms or services.
The recent acquisition is a positive step for content expansion, the product set seems to be quite limited. ZoomIn should concentrate on its core competency.

Hero MotoCorp to set up plants in Brazil  ArgentinaHero MotoCorp to set up plants in Brazil, Argentina
Press Trust Of India | Bogota (Colombia) Dec 01, 2014 12:38 AM IST
Eyeing aggressive expansion in Central and South America, Hero MotoCorp plans to set up manufacturing units in Brazil and Argentina, even as it expects its upcoming plant in Colombia to help widen its reach in the region.
"We believe the factory in Colombia will be a good hub for supply to other markets for us in Central and Latin America," Hero MotoCorp Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer Pawan Munjal said.
"We will get into manufacturing in Brazil. Argentina also requires us to manufacture locally, which is also on the cards. We would like to enter the Brazilian market along with the Rio Olympics in 2016," he added.
Hero MotoCorp launched six of its best-selling motorcycles here as part of its target to clock 1.2 million unit sales from global business by 2020.
The two-wheelers rolled out include the 100 cc motorcycles - Splendor iSmart, Eco Deluxe, and Passion-Pro; the 125 cc Glamour; the 150 cc Hunk and the 225 cc Karizma ZMR. The bikes will be sold in 120 outlets spread across the country.
This July, the company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary in Colombia and commenced construction of a manufacturing plant.
The project entails investment of $70 million in capital expenditure and working capital over a three-year period, he added. "In the first phase we are going for manufacturing 75,000 to 80,000 units in annual capacity, going up to 1,50,000 units in the next phase," Munjal said on the upcoming unit in Colombia. With this, the New Delhi-headquartered Hero MotoCorp will be the first Indian two-wheeler company to have a manufacturing plant in Latin America. The plant in Colombia is expected to go on stream by the middle of 2015.
Munjal said the company is looking to establish manufacturing and assembly units in 50 countries worldwide as part of its global expansion plans.
By 2020, the company aims to be in over 50 countries with 20 plus assembly facilities globally.

Milk Mantra's first acquisition
Odisha based dairy start-up Milk Mantra Dairy Pvt Ltd has acquired Sambalpur based Westernland Dairy as part of its expansion plans. This is the first acquisition by the company, which is looking to expand its operations in Odisha, and enter Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. The acquisition deal is pegged at around $1.6 million (Rs 10 crore).
Managing Director and Founder of Milk Mantra Srikumar Misra said, "This acquisition would immediately add additional capacity of 50,000 liters a day and also give us the ability to reach into western Odisha from where we have been receiving huge interest from consumers who want the Milky Moo brand." We are looking at both acquisitions and new opportunities, particularly in eastern India for our fresh Dairy Platform."
As part of product range expansion, the company plan to launch more dairy-based and value added products like sweet curd, functional milkshakes and probiotic drinks, by March.

Gujarat CMs daughter joins BJPPosted: December 1, 2014 1:18 am
Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel’s daughter Anar Patel has formally joined the BJP.
The Ahmedabad district unit of BJP on Sunday released a list of 31 ‘celebrities’ who have joined the party during its ongoing membership drive.
Among them are head of a famous Muslim shrine of Bhadiyad, a host of Hindu religious figures, musicians, former IPS officers and actors.
Forty-two-year-old Anar Patel is managing director of a firm named Gramshree Sanstha. According to BJP, Anar was brought into the party fold by local BJP leader Kishansinh Solanki.
“As per the instructions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah that people reluctant to join politics should be brought to the party fold, we approached Anar Patel and several others, and they readily agreed,” Solanki told The Indian Express.
Other names in the list include famous folk singer Farida Mir, Gujarati music artist Arvind Vegda, retired IPS officers V D Vanar and N J Zala, RSS worker Yogesh Kinariwala, actress Shital Shah and cardiologist Hitesh Patel.
Among the religious leaders inducted into the party are Bavamiya Lalumiya, head of a Muslim shrine in Bhatiyad, Hindu religious figures like Atmaprakasdas Swami of Jetalpur Swaminarayan Temple, Shreeji Prakash Swami of Hathijan Swaminarayan Temple, Damodardas Bapu and Jankidas Bapu from Viramgam, Bhagwandas Bapu and Giri Bapu from Bavla and Chaitanya Swami Maharaj from Sanand.
Three close relatives of television actor Disha Vankani have also joined the BJP.

Three-day RSS camp ends in HaridwarWritten by Sanjay Singh | Hardiwar |

The three-day RSS camp in Haridwar ended on Sunday with the organisers claiming that 5,239 students attended the event from the 291 of the total 499 colleges in Uttarakhand. The camp titled, “Nav Shrijan Shivir”, was held at Baba Ramdev’s Patanjali Yogpeeth.
Speaking at the closing ceremony, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat said the Sangh has become recognised world over and directed cadres to regularly attend the shakhas.
“Ye shakha hai jo humko taiyar karti hai. Swayamsewak ke samne bada lakshya hai (It is the shakhas that prepare us. There is a big goal for the swayamsewaks),” Bhagwat said in his over 45-minute long speech in which he sketched the journey of RSS’s growth — from its birth in 1925 to its founder Dr Hedegwar’s death in 1940 to its present worldwide networking.
He said RSS was a difficult organisation to understand and added that regular attempts were needed to understand the organisation. Referring to the country’s diversities, he said it was Hindutva that has accepted the diversities.

HC seeks govt reply on new slum rehab planWritten by Shalini Nair | Mumbai |
Posted: December 1, 2014 1:14 am
In what could be an alternative to the unsuccessful Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) scheme, the Bombay High Court has admitted a proposal for a new slum redevelopment model that envisages creating more open spaces, low-density settlements and additional affordable housing.
The division bench of Chief Justice Mohit Shah and Justice BP Colabawalla has given the state government three weeks to reply on the submission made by Nivara Hakk Welfare Centre in course of hearing a petition filed by NGO Citispace on encroachments on reserved open spaces. The proposal says it is possible to rehabilitate a slum population of 48 lakh and generate additional 4 lakh affordable houses while clearing 14.26 sq km encroached land for reserved open spaces, amenities and roads. The estimate of slum population excludes those living in Dharavi, Sanjay Gandhi National Park and airport land where redevelopment projects are already under way.
Under the SRA model, developers, who house slum residents vertically on a portion of the encroached plot, are allowed to build big apartments for sale on the remaining plot. As incentive in addition to the land, they are also given an FSI of 3 for such projects which, in cases where the density exceeds 650 tenements per hectare, can go as high as 4.
The submission made by Nivara Hakk proposes that within the existing SRA model where private developers get incentives for redeveloping slums in-situ, the government should restrict the maximum density to 500 tenements per hectare. Presently, the average densities of slums are 300 tenements per hectare, which post-SRA projects increase manifold, going up to 1250. “The existing slum residents can be housed in seven-storey structures as against the current practice of 15-plus storeys. If, after that, the developer is unable to consume his entire sale component while keeping the density within the cap, he should be granted transfer of development rights (TDR).
This TDR can then be sold by him to the government which will maintain a bank,” architect P K Das from Nivara Hakk said, adding the TDR can be purchased by developers who are developing low-density slum plots and require the TDR to attain the permitted density limits.
Moreover, the proposal states, all open spaces and amenities within the layout must be proportionate to the number of rehabilitation and sale units and accessible to both. For the purpose of affordable housing, the proposal says, the government must limit the sizes of sale component to 300-750 sq ft in area. To this end, slum sprawls, which presently account for 15 per cent of the total developable 244 sq km land continued…

Wont ask for lifting ban on govt staff attending shakhas  says RSSWritten by Shyamlal Yadav | Hardiwar |
Posted: December 1, 2014 1:13 am
Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat has said that they would not ask the Centre to reverse its order that prohibits government employees from attending its shakhas as there was no need for it. He said that it is up to government to think on it. As far as RSS is concerned, he added, it has never felt any obstacle because of the restrictions.
Bhagwat was reportedly speaking at an interaction with college and university teachers on Saturday in Haridwar that was not opened to the media.
“Hum sarkaar se koi maang nahi karne jaa rahe. Hum apna kaam kar rahe hain. Hamara kaam aise kisee avrodhon se nahi rukta (We are not going to demand anything from the government in this regard. We are doing our work. Our work is never affected by such restrictions),” sources quoted Bhagwat as saying when the issue was raised by a teacher of a government college.
While replying to a query posed by the teacher who said that being a government employee he is often targeted by his superiors, Bhagwat said that there are such orders of governments that prohibit government staff from taking part in RSS activities, but RSS work is spreading despite all such things.
Sources said that the RSS chief quoted an instance of a Kerala government employee who became a pracharak when government suspended him for carrying out RSS work. “His half pay (that employees get during suspension) was sufficient to feed his family and during suspension he became a full-time pracharak for the Sangh,” Bhagwat reportedly said.
Several state governments have imposed restrictions on government employees prohibiting them from taking part in RSS activities.
The 1966 order no 3/10/(S)/66-Ests.(B), issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs, says, “Government have always held the activities of these two organisations (RSS and Jamaat-e-Islami) to be of such a nature that participation in them by government servants would attract provisions of sub-rule (1) of Rule 5 of the Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1964. Any government servant, who is a member of or is otherwise associated with the aforesaid organisations or with their activities is liable to disciplinary action.”
Interestingly, PM Narendra Modi is a RSS pracharak, while Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh claims to be a Swayamsewak.

Pension Fund  Pension Fund Regulatory Development Authority  PFRDA  State Bank of IndiaWritten by Harish Damodaran , George Mathew | New Delhi | Mumbai |
Posted: December 1, 2014 1:13 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 1:15 pm
On September 23 — a week before the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) last monetary policy review — 10 state governments together raised Rs 8,100 crore of 10-year market loans at cut-off yields ranging from 8.9 per cent to 8.99 per cent.
Last Tuesday, 14 states managed to mop up Rs 15,225 crore again through 10-year paper. But this time, the yields were between 8.43 and 8.46 per cent.
What changed in these two months? Well, RBI did not bring down its overnight lending (“repo”) rate, which remains at 8 per cent. Yet, state governments have seen their borrowings costs fall by 50-odd basis points.
Since RBI’s last bi-monthly review on September 30, yields on the Centre’s benchmark 10-year security have dropped from 8.51 to 8.09 per cent. It is even more against the peak of 9.1 per cent on April 7. Then, too, the repo rate was 8 per cent.
But it isn’t just government bonds.
Since September 30, rates on corporate borrowings against one-year commercial paper — basically unsecured promissory notes — have come down by roughly 40 basis points to 8.9 per cent-levels.
Banks, likewise, are now mobilising funds through one-year tradable certificates of deposits at around 8.6 per cent, which is also a dip of 40 basis points.
Simply put, interest rates are falling without RBI doing anything. While even until two months ago the pressure to reduce policy rates was mainly from the finance ministry or CII and Ficci, today this is coming from the financial markets that are seemingly telling the RBI it has no option but to cut.
A good indicator of the market cues is the huge investor demand for bonds issued at high coupon rates. The expectation of interest rates falling has pushed up their prices and correspondingly driven down yield-to-maturity (YTM) to even below the original coupon levels.
Thus, a two-year non-convertible debenture of Larsen & Toubro issued on August 22 at 9.15 per cent is currently trading at an annualised YTM of 8.45 per cent on the National Stock Exchange.
Another indicator is bond spreads — the difference between yields on government securities and corporate bonds of similar maturity. These have declined from about 65 basis points to 40 basis points since September 30, which point to reduced risks associated with investing in bonds.
The question being asked is: even if RBI continues to ignore the rants of North Block or industry associations, can it ignore the markets that are clearly betting on rate reductions happening sooner than later?
Rana Kapoor, MD & CEO of Yes Bank, expects a 50 basis points cut in the repo rate in December itself.
DR Dogra, managing director of CARE Ratings, feels a rate cut is unlikely now and “RBI may choose to defer the decision for the policy review in February”.
Ashish Vaidya, executive director and head of trading at DBS India, notes that “a softening bias on rates” was apparent, but also believes that RBI will initiate cuts only from February.
“Inflation, both core and headline, seems to be coming down faster than anticipated. India is one continued…

Quest: Still youthful  no matter how old they areBy: Express News Service | New Delhi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 1:12 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 6:06 am
It was a satisfactory and proud moment for me as a teacher when I saw the students of my school showing reverence, having sympathy with the old people living in old age home. Before going there, I had doubts whether these children of new generation would be able to understand the situation, the feelings these people are going through. But when I saw a few girls getting emotional and crying, I was relieved that still there is hope in society. Humanity is alive. These children are our bright future and will keep alive the traditions of our country. Our roots are not so weak. I wish that every family has children who can support the parents in old age when they need them the most.
Bhupinder Kaur, TGT English
We had an enriching experience at the old age home. The people there gave us a warm welcome. It was a time of singing, sharing and sweet fellowship. Each old woman had a story of her own to share. Some of the stories were so emotional that some students started crying. Personally, what I felt after interacting with them was that there was still a hint of youth in them, no matter how old they are. There still prevailed the spirit of energy, enthusiasm and ecstasy. They all had a zest for life. Some liked dancing, some singing, while some just wanted us to lend them an ear. There was a woman who completed her college from Delhi University’s Miranda House. After college, she  became a maths teacher, teaching students of Class X and XI. She gave us a tough question that we solved with much effort.
There was a woman nearly 68 years old. She had met with an accident and her left leg got fractured. The doctor told her a rod would be fitted in her leg. She was not able to walk properly but she was full of life. Many were unhappy that they were not living with their families. But when they saw us, they were overjoyed and treated us like their own grandchildren and spent a lot of time with us. Their prayers and blessings were assured. Finally, it was time to leave. I then reached to say bye to an uncle. There were tears in his eyes. Soon, our school bus reached the gate to take us back. What I learnt from the experience was that your desire to achieve your dreams never fades away, even when the evening of life nears. They are spending their second childhood in the old age home. They too want to be loved and looked after in their old age, like attention-seeking children. It is for us to decide how happy their old age continued…

With tax incentives  pension funds can be on a par with EPFO productsWritten by George Mathew |
Posted: December 1, 2014 1:11 am
The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) is getting ready to bring in a host of regulatory measures in the next two months. New PFRDA Chairman HEMANT CONTRACTOR, who was till recently MD of State Bank of India, spoke to GEORGE MATHEW about a host issues from tax sops, fee structure to new plans in an interview. Excerpts:
What is your agenda for the pension sector?
The Act was passed last year and was notified in February this year. We are now putting in place all regulations to make the Act effective. We have to finalise 14 or 15 regulations in the next two months. That’s our immediate priority. Otherwise you can’t make the Act effective. The role of various stakeholders, aggregators, the role of trustees, record keeping agencies and custodians…all these things are getting finalised. The pushing of pension products, especially under Jan Dhan, is also a focus area.
Is the pension fund market growing?
The organised sector is fairly well covered. The EPFO covers all organised companies, the government and all civil servants are covered. What remains is the unorganised sector. This segment include hawkers, drivers, maidservants, rickshaw-wallahs. It’s not very easy to cover. That’s one we are now targetting. This is the bottom of pyramid and it’s not an easy job. We have been growing well. In the NPS Lite, which is the low-cost pension product, the numbers have touched 35 lakh. Last year we doubled the number. This year our plan is to grow by 50 lakh. Out of the fund size of Rs 70,000 crore, nearly 80 per cent is government money. The subscriber base will grow. These subscribers are small players and they hardly pay Rs 1,000 or Rs 2,000.
Are returns matching expectations? Will you hike equity investment limit?
On the returns front, we are on a par with all the private sector fellows. This is because the investment pattern has been made like that. You can go up to 50 per cent in equity. We have the lowest cost pension product. With just Rs 50, you can have a pension product. On hiking equity limit, subscribers are not very keen. They have gone up to only 15-16 per cent in equity though theoretically they can go up to 50 per cent.
Will you get a level playing field on the tax front vis-a-vis EPFO?
We have been asking for tax incentives so that we can be on par with EPFO products. Right now it’s EET (no tax during contribution and accumulation but taxed during withdrawal) pension and we want to make it EEE (no tax at any of the stages). The government said we will look at it. When the tax issue is sorted out, there will be lot more interest.
Is there any plan to bring EPFO under PFRDA or allow more players?
No. EPFO is kept out of our purview. The Act also says that. Right now there are seven pension fund managers in operation. We reviewed the position only in January this year. There’s no immediate plan to continued…

Manoj balances aggression with maturity  lifts East to Deodhar finalWritten by Devendra Pandey | Mumbai |
Posted: December 1, 2014 1:08 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 11:49 am
Ever since his debut seven years ago, Manoj Tiwary’s phone must have been pinged with more sympathetic messages than applause or praise. From being hailed as the next Dada of Bengal to eventually becoming the perfect example of an unlucky young cricketer, he has seen it all. Injuries — sometimes picked up during a football game or even while batting — have tagged him at worst possible times.
The impact of these mishaps have been to calm the once temperamental player. “I used to be very short tempered. I got upset about a lot of things, on as well as off the field. But as you grow older you become more mature. My injuries also gave me a lot of time to think about my game and also myself as a person,” he says.
That maturity could be seen at the Wankhede stadium on Sunday. It was Tiwary’s brilliant 151 which ensured East Zone remained in the hunt for the Deodhar Trophy with a 52-run against a Yuvraj Singh-led side (Harbhajan Singh missed out due to mild fever).
There was no shortage of intent in Tiwary’s 121-ball knock, which comprised 15 fours and four sixes. But rather than a mindless assault, the innings showcased responsibility tailored to the match situation. Tiwary used his aggression deliberately to break free of tricky situations. With his team on 2 for 33 inside 12 overs, on a track which had helped bowlers initially, Tiwary charged Parvez Rasool and hit the spinner for a six and four. They were just the fifth and sixth deliveries he had faced but the payoff to his gamble was that the field spread out allowing easy singles.
When North Zone threw in their experienced spinner Amit Mishra, Tiwary pulled his first delivery to the midwicket boundary. He slammed two more fours off Mishra’s next couple of overs and ensured the leg spinner couldn’t find a rhythm. He moved to 99 with a boundary past point off Yuvraj before getting to his hundred off the next delivery.
Tiwary ensured the scoreboard kept ticking over but began to accelerate post the 40 over mark when East had reached 178 for 5. 95 runs came off the last ten overs with the last two alone fetching 34 . Rishi Dhawan was hit for a six and two fours in the 49th over while Sandeep Sharma was dispatched for a six and a four in the final over to propel East to a respectable 273/8.
Stuttering chase
The North chase never really got going. Ashoke Dinda had Manan Vohra caught in the slips in the first over and soon had Unmukt Chand top-edging a wide ball to deep third man. All eyes were on Yuvraj Singh but he too disappointed. Chasing a full ball pitched way outside the off-stump, Yuvraj only managing to get an edge to continued…

In surprise move  India eases gold importrulesGold futures fall 1.13% on weak global cues
India on Friday scrapped a rule mandating traders to export 20 percent of all gold imported into the country in a surprise move that could cut smuggling and raise legal shipments into the world’s second-biggest consumer of the metal after China.
The so-called 80:20 import rule tying imports to exports was introduced last year to bring down inbound shipments and narrow the current account deficit that had hit a record.
“It has been decided by the Government of India to withdraw the 20:80 scheme and restrictions placed on import of gold,” the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said, without giving a reason for the change in the rule.
A policymaker associated with India’s gold import policy said the government instructed the RBI at 1830 local time on Friday to urgently change the rule. A notification was posted on the central bank’s website two hours later.
“We were not informed about the reason for scrapping this rule. The restrictions on who all can import who can’t are still valid,” said the policymaker, declining to be named as he is not authorised to talk to media.
Bachhraj Bamalwa, director of the All India Gems and Jewellery Trade Federation, said the 80:20 rule was not only encouraging smuggling but it was also misused by many traders.

No 80:20  no privilege for exportersNo 80:20, no privilege for exporters

Mumbai, November 30:  
Though the sentiment of domestic jewellers has been lifted with the removal of gold import curbs, exporters are bound to lose the privileged treatment they were enjoying for the last one year under the 80:20 scheme.
Banks and star trading houses, authorised to import gold, have been offering exporters special treatment in order to sell 20 per cent of their gold shipments, and were pushing the remaining 80 per cent of the consignment in the domestic market at a premium.
Pankaj Parekh, Vice-Chairman, Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council, said in the last 10 years, very few banks were comfortable with lending gold to exporters, because of the tight trail of records they had to keep on shipments and payment received.
Exporters borrow gold from banks based on the bank guarantee they produce, and have to ensure that they receive the payments within 90 days after shipment. If the criterion is not met, banks have to pay the custom duty and applicable VAT (value added tax) by dipping into the bank guarantee provided by the exporter.
If exports happen in a staggered manner, then banks have to set a 90-day alarm for receiving payment for each shipment. It becomes a tedious job for banks, said Parekh.
However, he added, the removal of import restriction would improve domestic supply and bring down the premium on gold to $1-2 an ounce from $18 an ounce. This would not only lead to lower price for domestic consumers, but also discourage hoarding, he said.
Surprise timing
Somasundaram PR, Managing Director, World Gold Council (India), said though the timing of the development (removal of gold import curbs) was surprising, it would definitely boost confidence of the jewellery industry. He added that the sharp import hikes in recent months were not triggered by changes in demand estimates. The official supply situation would now ease to the benefit of genuine exporters and manufacturers of gold jewellery, he said.

CAG raps Zoological Survey of India for poor execution of mandate
New Delhi, November 30:  
How serious are we about protecting endangered animal species? Going by the latest CAG report, the country’s record in even conducting a survey, the first step to any kind of protection, is abysmal.
For one, the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI), tasked to promote survey, research and prepare an inventory of fauna and prepare a Red Data Book (RDB) of those species that face a risk, last updated the book 20 years ago, in 1994.
For example, data provided by ZSI in 2011-12 show that the total number of ‘threatened’ species (vertebrates) in India has increased from 284 to 433. Against this, the audit observed that RDB carried accounts of only 153 species (35 per cent). Surveys of eight other species during 2001 to 2012 brought out in status reports were also not incorporated in the RDB, the CAG observed.
More importantly, the status survey of seven out of 10 endangered or critical species was not even initiated. After redefining its objectives in 2001, ZSI had fixed a target of status survey of 10 endangered species by 2012, but surveys of seven out 10 identified species — such as snow leopard, black-necked crane, king crab, wild ass, Hangul Kashmir Stag, Hoolock Gibbon and Nicobar Megapode, was not even initiated.
“In respect of the remaining three species, though the survey was undertaken, a publication was brought out in respect of only one species, as of March 2014,” the report said.
Flaying the ZSI for “poorly executing” the mandate given to it, the report said it lagged behind in the targets set for the survey and publication of faunal accounts.
Apart from the fact that there was “no standard methodology either for carrying out surveys or for assessment of the survey reports”, ZSI left the task at the “discretion of the scientists concerned, without any oversight,” it added.
ZSI was also pulled up for not building capacity in terms of trained manpower for taxonomic studies. “Of the total number of species collected (as of March 2012), only 34 per cent was taxonomically identified,” said the report.

No new curbs on gold imports for now‘No new curbs on gold imports for now’
Shishir Sinha
Liberalised regime will check smuggling, boost tax collection
New Delhi, November 30:  
After the removal of the restrictive 80:20 scheme, the Centre has no plans to raise import duty on gold. Tax authorities expect the removal of restrictions on gold imports to not just curb smuggling but also boost tax collections.
“The 80:20 scheme was an emergency measure to check the current account deficit (CAD). Now, when the deficit is under control, it has been scrapped,” a senior Finance Ministry official told BusinessLine.
The restriction had encouraged six trading houses to corner a major portion of gold imports, affecting supply, raising the premium and causing hardship to genuine users.
Surprise move
The Reserve Bank of India, in a surprise move, scrapped the scheme on Friday. Introduced last year, the scheme prescribed any entity importing gold to re-export 20 per cent of it in value-added form.
The official denied any new measure to curb gold imports, such as higher duty. Gold attracts an import duty of 10 per cent.
New legislation
Since this is the peak duty under international trade obligations and also as Parliament is in session, the Government would need to bring a legislation using its special power to further hike the duty.
The official said: “There is no such proposal under consideration, at least for the time being.”
Boosting tax collection was not the key reason for scrapping the restrictive scheme, the official said, adding: “We will need to see how this move will benefit tax collection.”
Meanwhile, another Revenue Department official admitted that legal gold imports were set to rise which, in turn, will benefit duty collection.
Import duty is part of indirect taxes, which registered a growth of just 5.6 per cent during April-October against a target of over 25 per cent.
Gold imports have surged in recent months, mainly due to the ongoing wedding season. But softening of crude prices has offset this surge in the country’s overall import bill.
This, along with lower growth of exports, shrunk the trade deficit to $83.75 billion in April-October this year from $87.32 billion last year. The CAD for the full year is expected to come down to 1.4 per cent from 1.7 per cent in 2013-14.
Right direction
Sonal Varma of Nomura said that as a result of the withdrawal of this restriction, “gold imports will rise by $8 billion annually, on our estimate, but this will easily be offset by the savings due to lower oil price (every $10 fall in oil prices lowers the oil import bill by around $9 billion).
“This is a move in the right direction, as it removes distortions and indicates that policymakers are growing confident on the external sector’s outlook.”
The World Gold Council estimates gold demand in India at around 850-900 tonnes, marginally lower than last year.

Trinamool Congress dubs BJP chief Amit Shah's rally as 'grand flop show'

Amit Shah
(Trinamool Congress alleged…)
KOLKATA: Ruling Trinamool Congress today refused to attach much importance to BJP chief Amit Shah's rally in the city and described it as a "grand flop show" with poor attendance.
"Such a meeting is organised by our block presidents," TMC Secretary-General Partha Chatterjee said.
Despite its attack on Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, BJP would not be successful in tarnishing her image and honesty.
"The whole world knows about her honesty and there can't be any doubt," he said.
Chatterjee, who is also the state's Higher Education Minister, alleged that BJP was trying to disintegrate regional political parties by using power and police to maintain its political supremacy.
"BJP is now eyeing civic poll followed by the Assembly poll in 2016, but it will fail to achieve its target. BJP should now concentrate in Delhi before focussing on Kolkata (civic poll) and then West Bengal ," Chatterjee said.
Another senior TMC leader and state Panchayat Minister Subrata Mukherjee said the rally was a "grand flop show" with poor attendance. "The BJP tried to bring many leaders from northern India, but failed to make it a success," he said.
Alleging that BJP was using CBI and NIA for political purposes, Mukherjee said, "Both the probe agencies have joined hands with the government in power at the Centre to help BJP maintain its supremacy."
"The BJP government should know that the Mamata Banerjee government initiated prompt action against the Saradha chit fund scam and arrested Saradha Group chief Sudipto Sen along with several others immediately.
"We have already returned money to over five lakh poor investors," he added.

After Delhi and Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu has topped in foreign direct investment (FDI) equity inflows in the current financial year, according to Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. None of the other states has touched the $1,000-million mark.
According to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data, Tamil Nadu received $1,990.88 million during the April-September 2014 period. This is the third-largest after Mumbai — which includes Maharashtra, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, Daman & Diu — which received $2,578.76 million. New Delhi (Delhi and part of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana) received $2,424.61 million.
The FDI equity inflow during the current financial year stood at $14,472.24 million.  Among the southern states, Andhra Pradesh received $789.69 million, Karnataka $562.20 million and Kerala $45.69 million.
Officials in Tamil Nadu are hopeful the state would perform better than last year. According to them, compared with other states, Tamil Nadu has got more exposure to the global economy. And with the global economy likely to turn around this year, the state stands to gain.
In 2011-12, Tamil Nadu received $1,422.39 million, which increased to $2,807.45 million in 2012-13 and dipped to $2,116.24 million in 2013-14.

College students perform at streets to make city roadssaferWritten by Dipti Nagpaul | Mumbai |
Posted: December 1, 2014 1:43 am
Outside Air India building at Nariman Point, two boys lie on the street, unmoving. A crowd has gathered around them, and people speak in hushed tones of the “bike accident” that has caused the boys injury. Soon, a group of students arrive at the scene, placards in hand. In a sing-song fashion, they tell the onlookers that the boys were racing one another on their bikes, driving rashly, which caused the accident.
Pointing to their placards, they talk about the importance of road safety. Soon, the two boys are up on their feet and along with their friends, they begin to perform another skit, this time focussing on the importance of following traffic lights.
Those who live or work in and around the areas of Churchgate, Marine Lines, Nariman Point and CST, are likely to have come across this bunch of students from KC College, Churchgate, in the past few months. Through a string of specially choreographed and directed street plays and skits, the students are aiming to create awareness regarding road safety.
This, however, isn’t an initiative limited to KC College alone, but a state-wide programme. The Home Department and traffic police in the state have roped in the Department of Higher and Technical Education, Maharashtra, for a road safety drive under National Service Scheme (NSS).
“The idea was to get youth involved as they are also the target audience for the programme. Also, it’s easier to orient students who are already involved in social service through NSS,” said Dr BK Upadhyay, Joint Commissioner of Police (Traffic). In September this year, similarly, Jai Hind College organised a Ride for Safety event under the same initiative.
The involvement of NSS means the colleges that execute the project well are rewarded points and also stand a chance to win cash reward of up to Rs 2 lakh and a trophy. “We have been working hard on the project since August. We have been performing the street play at least twice a week in areas of South Mumbai, such as near Eros, at Churchgate and CST stations, near GT Hospital and so on,” says Manoj Kumar Kannojia, one of the 20 volunteers representing KC College.
The programme was initiated in August and will go on till December. As part of it, universities across Maharashtra have been asked to get colleges to involve students as volunteers in creating awareness on road safety. “They can use any means – street plays, rallies, lectures or even as the theme of their college festival – to get the audience involved,” explained Atul Salunke, the liaison officer and officer on special duty, NSS cell, Mumbai University.
Salunke adds that colleges have also been asked to ensure that no student on their roll driving a vehicle should do so without a license. To ensure this, colleges have also organised camps on their premises in association with RTO to get continued…

I think by December 2015 there should be a rate cut between 50-100bpsWritten by Sandeep Singh |
Posted: December 1, 2014 1:43 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 2:04 am
Amid the chorus for an interest rate cut from the Reserve Bank of India in its forthcoming monetary policy review on Tuesday, Keki Mistry, vice chairman and CEO of HDFC Ltd said that the central bank may wait for one more policy before going for a rate cut. In an interview to Sandeep Singh, Mistry said that going further, rates could be cut by up to 100 basis points . Excerpts:
While oil prices have slipped and GDP growth is down to 5.3 per cent, do you see RBI going for a cut in interest rates now? 
RBI will certainly start cutting the rates but not now. While there may be a cut even on Tuesday, I personally feel that they would wait for one more month and see how the inflation numbers show up. Based on it they may do it in the next policy review meeting.
How much interest rate cut do you see over the next one year?
If everything else remains in line, I think by December 2015 there should be a rate cut between 50-100 basis points.
How do see that affecting the housing market which has seen a slowdown?
There was never a slowdown, it has been business as usual. But certainly with the economy looking to pick up, it will lead to higher activity in the sector and more demand for housing.
How do you see India positioned currently?
From a global standpoint, India is in a sweet spot. Commodity prices, oil prices and inflation are down and everything that one would like to see from a macroeconomic perspective on India is happening now, and people are looking at India with tremendous amount of interest. China is slowing down and Russia and Brazil too are not doing well but India is ready to go at a different platform. Nobody is expecting that we will start growing at 7 per cent in a hurry. People are willing to wait for it.
Do you see a pick up in the investment cycle now?
The economy is on the right track and business sentiments are at an all time high and people in business are now looking to invest. While there are some who still have excess capacity there are many who are now looking to invest. It is only a matter of time that the investment cycle will pick up and people will start investing in plant and machinery.

A force that has little firepower  even lessskillsBy: Express News Service | Mumbai |
Posted: December 1, 2014 1:39 am
During an anti-terror drill at a suburban mall recently, while commandos were padding across a lawn for perimeter security, a Mumbai Police constable fished out a weathered set of handwritten notes from his pocket. “He wanted to read through quickly on how to handle a weapon, which he had last touched during his training days in the academy. He said he never got to use that advanced weapon in the firing range where he got an SLR for practice,” says an officer.
Six years after 26/11,  just how prepared the city’s policemen are is a question they ask themselves everyday. For, visit to a firing range is only an annual affair and during this, only a select few weapons are available to be test-fired. Ballistic experts say the constabulary’s firing skills are never tested or improved and inadequate weapons training affects their preparedness.
At the lone functional firing range at Ghatkopar for the constabulary, AK-47 was discontinued in 2012 after residents living even beyond its 300-metre range complained of bullets hitting their walls. So no constable, it can be safely assumed, has practised firing this long-range weapon for the past 24 months at least. The outcome: The only weapon a constable is now allowed is a carbine. “Misfiring is frequent as the cartridges are outdated too,” says an official.
A simulated firing range has been made available in Worli, but it’s simply not enough. At Ghatkopar, the weapon available to practise is the .303 rifle (which is now being scrapped and replaced by SLRs). In the annual firing that is allowed — every constable is allowed one day of firing in a year — he basically gets five rounds of trial firing and later target firing. There is no planned schedule for any of these, and men are selected randomly based on their availability from executive functions.
Theoretical knowledge is equally thin. In his or her lifetime, a Mumbai Police constable gets 15 days of theory weapons training.
The force has a total of just about 30,000 weapons, many not serviced for years.
Officers are allowed 15 rounds at the Naigaon firing range annually, where they brush up on firing their pistols and revolvers. A police inspector attached to a suburban police station said, “It’s over even before you settle.”
For the five-year-old Force One, things might look different now, with a new set of men being pulled in from the ranks. The last 100 of the first batch of 350 commandos will be out this year, making the entire Force One a bunch of new hands. “Most of us are trained for five years, in multiple settings, in different terror scenarios. We now know the importance of buddy-pair, how to dispose of an IED, and we do firing on advance weapons every week. Next month, I will be posted in State Reserve Police Force, from where over 80 per cent of the commandos are picked. My weapon in my department is a lathi,” says a commando.
As one IPS officer summed it up: “We cannot really speak much of our counter-terror units since we have not tested them yet. Fortunately, for all of us, they haven’t faced an attack yet. It would be incorrect to either speak their laurels or run them down.”

Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel’s daughter Anar Patel has formally joined the BJP.
The Ahmedabad district unit of BJP on Sunday released a list of 31 ‘celebrities’ who have joined the party during its ongoing membership drive.
Among them are head of a famous Muslim shrine of Bhadiyad, a host of Hindu religious figures, musicians, former IPS officers and actors.
Forty-two-year-old Anar Patel is managing director of a firm named Gramshree Sanstha. According to BJP, Anar was brought into the party fold by local BJP leader Kishansinh Solanki.
“As per the instructions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah that people reluctant to join politics should be brought to the party fold, we approached Anar Patel and several others, and they readily agreed,” Solanki told The Indian Express.
Other names in the list include famous folk singer Farida Mir, Gujarati music artist Arvind Vegda, retired IPS officers V D Vanar and N J Zala, RSS worker Yogesh Kinariwala, actress Shital Shah and cardiologist Hitesh Patel.
Among the religious leaders inducted into the party are Bavamiya Lalumiya, head of a Muslim shrine in Bhatiyad, Hindu religious figures like Atmaprakasdas Swami of Jetalpur Swaminarayan Temple, Shreeji Prakash Swami of Hathijan Swaminarayan Temple, Damodardas Bapu and Jankidas Bapu from Viramgam, Bhagwandas Bapu and Giri Bapu from Bavla and Chaitanya Swami Maharaj from Sanand.
Three close relatives of television actor Disha Vankani have also joined the BJP.

Three-day RSS camp ends inHaridwarWritten by Sanjay Singh | Hardiwar |
Posted: December 1, 2014 1:15 am
The three-day RSS camp in Haridwar ended on Sunday with the organisers claiming that 5,239 students attended the event from the 291 of the total 499 colleges in Uttarakhand. The camp titled, “Nav Shrijan Shivir”, was held at Baba Ramdev’s Patanjali Yogpeeth.
Speaking at the closing ceremony, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat said the Sangh has become recognised world over and directed cadres to regularly attend the shakhas.
“Ye shakha hai jo humko taiyar karti hai. Swayamsewak ke samne bada lakshya hai (It is the shakhas that prepare us. There is a big goal for the swayamsewaks),” Bhagwat said in his over 45-minute long speech in which he sketched the journey of RSS’s growth — from its birth in 1925 to its founder Dr Hedegwar’s death in 1940 to its present worldwide networking.
He said RSS was a difficult organisation to understand and added that regular attempts were needed to understand the organisation. Referring to the country’s diversities, he said it was Hindutva that has accepted the diversities.

HC seeks govt reply on new slum rehabplanWritten by Shalini Nair | Mumbai |
Posted: December 1, 2014 1:14 am
In what could be an alternative to the unsuccessful Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) scheme, the Bombay High Court has admitted a proposal for a new slum redevelopment model that envisages creating more open spaces, low-density settlements and additional affordable housing.
The division bench of Chief Justice Mohit Shah and Justice BP Colabawalla has given the state government three weeks to reply on the submission made by Nivara Hakk Welfare Centre in course of hearing a petition filed by NGO Citispace on encroachments on reserved open spaces. The proposal says it is possible to rehabilitate a slum population of 48 lakh and generate additional 4 lakh affordable houses while clearing 14.26 sq km encroached land for reserved open spaces, amenities and roads. The estimate of slum population excludes those living in Dharavi, Sanjay Gandhi National Park and airport land where redevelopment projects are already under way.
Under the SRA model, developers, who house slum residents vertically on a portion of the encroached plot, are allowed to build big apartments for sale on the remaining plot. As incentive in addition to the land, they are also given an FSI of 3 for such projects which, in cases where the density exceeds 650 tenements per hectare, can go as high as 4.
The submission made by Nivara Hakk proposes that within the existing SRA model where private developers get incentives for redeveloping slums in-situ, the government should restrict the maximum density to 500 tenements per hectare. Presently, the average densities of slums are 300 tenements per hectare, which post-SRA projects increase manifold, going up to 1250. “The existing slum residents can be housed in seven-storey structures as against the current practice of 15-plus storeys. If, after that, the developer is unable to consume his entire sale component while keeping the density within the cap, he should be granted transfer of development rights (TDR).
This TDR can then be sold by him to the government which will maintain a bank,” architect P K Das from Nivara Hakk said, adding the TDR can be purchased by developers who are developing low-density slum plots and require the TDR to attain the permitted density limits.
Moreover, the proposal states, all open spaces and amenities within the layout must be proportionate to the number of rehabilitation and sale units and accessible to both. For the purpose of affordable housing, the proposal says, the government must limit the sizes of sale component to 300-750 sq ft in area. To this end, slum sprawls, which presently account for 15 per cent of the total developable 244 sq km land continued…

Wont ask for lifting ban on govt staff attending shakhas  saysRSSWritten by Shyamlal Yadav | Hardiwar |
Posted: December 1, 2014 1:13 am
Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat has said that they would not ask the Centre to reverse its order that prohibits government employees from attending its shakhas as there was no need for it. He said that it is up to government to think on it. As far as RSS is concerned, he added, it has never felt any obstacle because of the restrictions.
Bhagwat was reportedly speaking at an interaction with college and university teachers on Saturday in Haridwar that was not opened to the media.
“Hum sarkaar se koi maang nahi karne jaa rahe. Hum apna kaam kar rahe hain. Hamara kaam aise kisee avrodhon se nahi rukta (We are not going to demand anything from the government in this regard. We are doing our work. Our work is never affected by such restrictions),” sources quoted Bhagwat as saying when the issue was raised by a teacher of a government college.
While replying to a query posed by the teacher who said that being a government employee he is often targeted by his superiors, Bhagwat said that there are such orders of governments that prohibit government staff from taking part in RSS activities, but RSS work is spreading despite all such things.
Sources said that the RSS chief quoted an instance of a Kerala government employee who became a pracharak when government suspended him for carrying out RSS work. “His half pay (that employees get during suspension) was sufficient to feed his family and during suspension he became a full-time pracharak for the Sangh,” Bhagwat reportedly said.
Several state governments have imposed restrictions on government employees prohibiting them from taking part in RSS activities.
The 1966 order no 3/10/(S)/66-Ests.(B), issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs, says, “Government have always held the activities of these two organisations (RSS and Jamaat-e-Islami) to be of such a nature that participation in them by government servants would attract provisions of sub-rule (1) of Rule 5 of the Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1964. Any government servant, who is a member of or is otherwise associated with the aforesaid organisations or with their activities is liable to disciplinary action.”
Interestingly, PM Narendra Modi is a RSS pracharak, while Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh claims to be a Swayamsewak.

Pension Fund  Pension Fund Regulatory Development Authority  PFRDA  State Bank ofIndiaWritten by Harish Damodaran , George Mathew | New Delhi | Mumbai |
Posted: December 1, 2014 1:13 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 1:15 pm
On September 23 — a week before the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) last monetary policy review — 10 state governments together raised Rs 8,100 crore of 10-year market loans at cut-off yields ranging from 8.9 per cent to 8.99 per cent.
Last Tuesday, 14 states managed to mop up Rs 15,225 crore again through 10-year paper. But this time, the yields were between 8.43 and 8.46 per cent.
What changed in these two months? Well, RBI did not bring down its overnight lending (“repo”) rate, which remains at 8 per cent. Yet, state governments have seen their borrowings costs fall by 50-odd basis points.
Since RBI’s last bi-monthly review on September 30, yields on the Centre’s benchmark 10-year security have dropped from 8.51 to 8.09 per cent. It is even more against the peak of 9.1 per cent on April 7. Then, too, the repo rate was 8 per cent.
But it isn’t just government bonds.
Since September 30, rates on corporate borrowings against one-year commercial paper — basically unsecured promissory notes — have come down by roughly 40 basis points to 8.9 per cent-levels.
Banks, likewise, are now mobilising funds through one-year tradable certificates of deposits at around 8.6 per cent, which is also a dip of 40 basis points.
Simply put, interest rates are falling without RBI doing anything. While even until two months ago the pressure to reduce policy rates was mainly from the finance ministry or CII and Ficci, today this is coming from the financial markets that are seemingly telling the RBI it has no option but to cut.
A good indicator of the market cues is the huge investor demand for bonds issued at high coupon rates. The expectation of interest rates falling has pushed up their prices and correspondingly driven down yield-to-maturity (YTM) to even below the original coupon levels.
Thus, a two-year non-convertible debenture of Larsen & Toubro issued on August 22 at 9.15 per cent is currently trading at an annualised YTM of 8.45 per cent on the National Stock Exchange.
Another indicator is bond spreads — the difference between yields on government securities and corporate bonds of similar maturity. These have declined from about 65 basis points to 40 basis points since September 30, which point to reduced risks associated with investing in bonds.
The question being asked is: even if RBI continues to ignore the rants of North Block or industry associations, can it ignore the markets that are clearly betting on rate reductions happening sooner than later?
Rana Kapoor, MD & CEO of Yes Bank, expects a 50 basis points cut in the repo rate in December itself.
DR Dogra, managing director of CARE Ratings, feels a rate cut is unlikely now and “RBI may choose to defer the decision for the policy review in February”.
Ashish Vaidya, executive director and head of trading at DBS India, notes that “a softening bias on rates” was apparent, but also believes that RBI will initiate cuts only from February.
“Inflation, both core and headline, seems to be coming down faster than anticipated. India is one continued…

Oil prices near four-year low after OPEC decides against output cutComments
Brent crude fell towards $72 a barrel on Friday, close to a four-year low touched the day after OPEC decided not to cut oil output to support prices.
OPEC's decision, which came after Saudi Arabia blocked calls from poorer members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut, led to a rout in oil prices on Thursday.
"The move aligns with Saudi Arabia's stance to allow the oil market to stabilise itself and be driven by supply and demand fundamentals," ANZ analysts said in a note on Friday.
Brent crude had fallen 13 cents to $72.33 a barrel by 0211 after plummeting $5.17 to close the previous session at 72.58. Earlier on Thursday, it touched its weakest since July 2010 at $71.25.
The crude benchmark is headed for its steepest monthly decline since November 2008, after falling more than 15% this month.
Brent has lost more than 37% since June when it hit $115.71 a barrel, hurt as increasing shale production in North America created an oil glut amid sluggish global economic growth.
US crude for January delivery plunged $4.86 to $68.83 a barrel, after dropping to its lowest since May 2010 at $67.75 in early Asian trade. U.S. markets were shut on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday.
US crude has shed almost 15% in November, its biggest monthly drop since May 2012.
OPEC's decision marked a "watershed" for oil markets, Barclays analysts said in a note.
"In keeping the production target at 30 million barrels per day, OPEC is clearly signaling that it will no longer bear the burden of market adjustment alone and this decision puts the onus on other producers, especially U.S. tight oil to adjust as well," they said.
Russia's most powerful oil official Igor Sechin said oil prices could fall to $60 or below by the end of the first half of next year and that Russia had the potential to cut between 200,000 and 300,000 barrels a day of production if prices remained low.
Responding to OPEC's decision, Venezuela president Nicolas Maduro said the country would keep campaigning until oil prices rebounded to $100 per barrel.
A further blow to global oil demand could come on Monday when China releases official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) date for November which could show slower growth, according to a Reuters poll.

Govt plans to cut stake in public sector banks to 52%; may get 89 120 crComments
The government is planning to bring down its stake in public sector banks to 52%, which can fetch the exchequer Rs. 89,120 crore.
Minister of state for finance Jayant Sinha told the Lok Sabha the government is "considering" to bring down its equity in the state-owned banks as it would reduce budgetary requirement for capitalisation of public sector banks (PSBs).
"The step would substantially reduce the requirement of budgetary provision for infusion of capital in public sector banks," he said in a written reply.
Sinha further said "the reduction of government share in equity capital of PSBs to 52% will enable mobilisation of Rs. 89,120 crore approx on the basis of current market price on November 21".
There are about two dozen PSBs and government holding in them is between 56.26% to 88.63%. The government has infused an amount of Rs. 58,600 crore since 2011 in these PSBs.
Public sector banks require equity capital of Rs. 2.4 lakh crore by 2018 to meet Basel III norms. For the current fiscal, the government has allocated Rs. 11,200 crore for bank capitalisation. As per existing law, government holding in PSBs cannot fall below 51%.

Rupee falls to nine-month low of 62.03 against dollarComments
Bucking the strong trend in stocks, the Indian rupee on Friday tumbled 16 paise to close at almost nine-month low of 62.03 against the greenback following sustained dollar demand from importers, including oil firms.
The rupee was also under pressure after government data showed that fiscal deficit touched 89.6% of the Budget Estimates for 2014-15 to cross Rs. 4.75 lakh crore at the end of October.
At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market, the domestic unit commenced lower at 61.93 a dollar from previous close of 61.87. It tried to recover by touching intra-day high of 61.8775. Later, it met with strong resistance on heavy month-end dollar demand from importers, mainly oil refiners, and fell back to a low of 62.0725.
It finally concluded at 62.03, showing a fall of 16 paise or 0.26%. Previously, it had closed at 62.04 on March 3, 2014. Stocks continued their upward sprint for the third straight session Friday with benchmark Sensex galloping 255.08 points to 28,693.99 and Nifty surging 94.05 points to 8,588.25 as tumbling oil prices strengthened the case for a rate cut by the RBI next week.
Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) injected $119.41 million on Thursday, as per Sebi data. The dollar index was up by 0.14% against its major global rivals.
Veracity Group CEO Pramit Brahmbhatt said: "Rupee traded weak today taking cues from the dollar demand from oil importers though local equities traded strong. The trading range for the spot USD/INR pair is expected to be within 61.60 to 62.40."

BSE market cap crosses 100 lakh cr  investors wealth doubles in 5 yearsComments
Market value of BSE-listed firms crossed Rs. 100-trillion landmark with the exchange calling it a reflection of India's potential as a new age powerhouse.
"India and the BSE reached a significant milestone today. It is a reflection of the potential of India as a new age powerhouse," BSE MD and CEO Ashishkumar Chauhan told PTI.
"It is also significant that it has happened after highly successful tour of our Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Nepal for SAARC, Australia for G20, Myanmar and Fiji," Chauhan said.
Measured in terms of total market capitalisation of all listed companies on BSE, the overall investor wealth in the Indian stock market rose to Rs. 100.01 lakh crore in early morning trade at 1005 hours as the benchmark Sensex soared by over 300 points in its sustained record rally.
"This achievement is a reflection of India's growth potential as seen from the foreign investor's perspective as well as the competitiveness of Indian entrepreneurs to manage world class organisations," Chauhan added.
The 30 Sensex companies alone, which are among the biggest companies in the country, now account for nearly 50 per cent or about Rs. 47 lakh crore of total investor wealth.
"It has taken India and BSE 140 years to reach this milestone of Rs. 100 lakh crore market capitalisation. However, given India's potential, India should be able to achieve multiple times Rs. 100 lakh crore market capitalisation in times to come," Chauhan said.
The total market cap of all BSE listed companies had crossed Rs. 10 lakh crore mark nearly 11 years ago in 2003, while it has doubled from about Rs. 50 lakh crore five years ago in 2009.

3 Tips for Using Credit Wisely During the Holidays3 tips for using credit wisely during the holidays
Southern Democrats Urge A Return To Party BasicsSouthern Democrats Urge A Return To Party Basics
 | By                                                                By BILL BARROW

ATLANTA (AP) — Southern Democrats are joining others in the party who say that a return to advocating to lift people out of economic hardship and emphasizing spending on education and public works will re-energize black voters and attract whites as well.
"It's time to draw a line in the sand and not surrender our brand," Rickey Cole, the party chairman in Mississippi, said. He believes candidates have distanced themselves from the past half-century of Democratic principles.
"We don't need a New Coke formula," Cole said. "The problem is we've been out there trying to peddle Tab and RC Cola."
Cole and other Southern Democrats acknowledge divisions with prominent populists such as Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is expected to run for president in 2016, and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Yet they see merit in pushing stronger voting rights laws, tighter bank regulation, labor-friendly policies such as a higher minimum wage and other familiar party themes.
Democratic politics have become a tough sell in the conservative South. A major challenge in the region is finding candidates who can win high-profile races now that Republicans, who scored well in midterm elections earlier this month, dominate the leadership in state legislatures and across statewide offices.
Georgia Democrats thought legacy candidates were the answer. But Senate hopeful Michelle Nunn, former Sen. Sam Nunn's daughter, and gubernatorial challenger Jason Carter, former President Jimmy Carter's grandson, each fell short by about 8 percentage points despite well-funded campaigns and ambitious voter-registration drives.
Arkansas Democrats lost an open governor's seat and two-term Sen. Mark Pryor. Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu led an eight-candidate primary but faces steep odds in a Dec. 6 runoff. Democrats' closest statewide loss in the South was North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan's 1.7 percentage point margin of defeat.
Exit polling suggests Democrats did not get the black turnout they needed and lost badly among whites. Nunn and Carter got fewer than 1 in 4 white votes, while Pryor took 31 percent and Landrieu 18 percent.
Should Landrieu lose, Democrats will be left without a single governor, U.S. senator or legislative chamber under their control from the Carolinas westward to Texas.
J.P. Morrell, a state senator from New Orleans, faulted a muddled message that began with candidates avoiding President Barack Obama. "You have to articulate why the economic policies we advocate as Democrats actually benefit people on the ground," Morrell said.
In Georgia, Nunn supported a minimum-wage increase and gender-pay equity, but her television ads focused on ending partisan rancor. Carter mostly accused Republican Gov. Nathan Deal of shortchanging public education. Nunn and Carter supported Medicaid expansion under Obama's health overhaul, but neither emphasized that argument in television advertising.
"No real economic message got through," said Vincent Fort, a state senator from Atlanta.
Georgia's Democratic chairman, DuBose Porter, defended Carter and Nunn as "world-class candidates" who can run again. He said Democrats "proved Georgia can be competitive in 2016," but he cautioned against looking for a nominee other than Clinton. "She puts us in play," he said.
In an interview, Carter focused more on tactics than on broad messaging, saying the party must register minority voters and continue outreach to whites. "If 120,000 people change their mind in this election, it comes out differently," he said. "But it takes a lot of time to build those relationships. ... You can't expect it to happen in one year."
Gary Pearce, a Democratic strategist and commentator in North Carolina, said Hagan's margin in a GOP wave offers hope for 2016, when statewide executive offices will be on the ballot. Fresh arguments, he said, "will have to come from younger Democrats in the cities." He pointed to several young Democratic candidates who won county commission seats in Wake County, home to Raleigh.
Cole, the Mississippi chairman, acknowledged that any new approach won't close the party's gap in the South on abortion, same-sex marriage and guns, and said Democrats intensify that cultural disconnect with "identity politics."
While the party's positions on gay rights, minority voting access, women's rights and immigration are not wrong, Cole said, "those people who don't see themselves in those groups say, 'What have the Democrats got for me?'"
Unapologetic populism, he said, would "explain better that the Democratic Party is for justice and opportunity — with no qualifiers — for everyone."

Clarke s birthday gift to  brother  Hughes: A moving tribute  album of old photosprint
Australian cricket captain Michael Clarke wrote a moving birthday tribute to Phillip Hughes Sunday, calling him the brother he never had as players continued to grieve over his death.
Hughes, who would have celebrated his 26th birthday on Sunday, died Thursday two days after he was knocked unconscious by a bouncer while batting in a domestic match at the Sydney Cricket Ground.
Australia's first Test against India, which was due to start on Thursday in Brisbane, has been postponed with no new date yet scheduled.
Clarke said he "struggled to comprehend how this tragedy could happen to one of life's true characters and gentlemen".
"His cricketing achievements -- of which there were many -- really play second fiddle to the human qualities that he exhibited," Clarke wrote in the Sunday Telegraph.
"Loyal to a fault, eternally optimistic, kind-hearted, wicked sense of humour, a child-like verve for life... I really could go on and on."
In 2 hours and 6 min it will be my Brothers 26th BDay. Please get yourself a drink and raise your glass!— Michael Clarke (@MClarke23) November 29, 2014
Clarke wrote of how he was instantly drawn to Hughes when the talented cricketer, then 17, moved to Sydney from his hometown of Macksville to play for his club Western Suburbs.
"I don't think in 12 years of playing cricket at the top level I have ever come across a more loyal or generous-hearted teammate," Clarke wrote.

Cricket Australia has said rescheduling of any Tests in the four-match series would be done in full consultation with the players, the Indian Board, the International Cricket Council and broadcasters.
Local media said the start of the Brisbane Test could be delayed by one or two days to give players some room to grieve after Hughes' funeral on Wednesday at Macksville in northern New South Wales.
Alternatively, the second Test in Adelaide, Hughes' adopted home, could be recast as the opening match of the series, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

In this MP village  having a  ghar jamai  is all the rageIn this MP village, having a 'ghar jamai' is all the rage

A more than 200-year-old tradition that questions the rules of patriarchy has one Madhya Pradesh offering a rare win-win for brides and grooms – and their respective families.
Nimola, just five kilometers from Burhanpur district headquarters, has for generations seen sons-in-law move in, earning the village a new name: jamai gaon (village of the sons-in-law). (Illustration: Abhimanyu)
Nimola, just five kilometers from Burhanpur district headquarters, has for generations seen sons-in-law move in, earning the village a new name: jamai gaon (village of the sons-in-law).
Out of the 700 houses, 675 have the daughter’s husband living in.
The tradition started over 200 years ago and families are more than willing following it for they see it as a harbinger of good luck.
"Some say that about 200 years ago, a Patel's daughter was married to some other village but his son-in-law was not doing anything and sold away his land. After he became bankrupt, the Patels brought the couple to the village and gave him a share from their property after which he started prospering. Since then most of the son-laws come back to this village for work or trade," said Dr KK Sonwane, a resident of the village, who himself is a ‘ghar jamai’.
The tradition is followed by all three major communities of the village: Marathas, Tadvi Pathan and Buddhists.
"The second reason why people proper in this village is because of power loom factories, sugar factory, Nepanagar paper mills which surrounds the village and provides employment to the residents," Sonwane added.
More than 2 lakh people of Khandwa and Burhanpur are employed in these industries.
With their hubbies and parents both with them, the girls are expectedly gleeful. "We never want to go outside this village and (all of us) want to marry a man who would come and live here," said Alisha (18), a resident of the village.
"We treat damaads with respect and have no objection to them staying here. They are just like any other family member," said Dullu Khan, whose sister's husband has been living in the house for the last six years.
The village is peaceful, rarely requiring a visit from the police.
"Being a damaad has its own responsibilities. None of them are addicted to any vices for they don't want to lose respect," said Prahlad Mahajan, 78, one of the oldest damaads of the village who came here about 50 years ago.
The sons-in-law are also given a share in the ancestral property. 
And most of the sarpanch of the village, which were elected in last 60 years, were also damaads.
"We believe damaads are a boon for the development of the village," Ashok Patel, a former sarpanch and a son-in-law of the village, said.

Campaigning ended on Sunday for the second phase of Jharkhand polls which saw Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi addressing rallies to woo the voters, who will cast ballot in 20 Assembly seats on December 2.
Former chief ministers Arjun Munda and Madhu Koda are in the fray among 223 candidates, including 35 women.
While campaigning ended at 5pm at Jamshedpur(East) and Jamshedpur(West) constituencies, it ended at 3pm in 18 other seats going for polls, Election Commission sources said.
With 16 out of the 20 constituencies reserved for tribals, Prime Minister Modi and Congress leaders Sonia and Rahul Gandhi took up the tribal issue.
During his campaigning, Modi appealed to the electorate to ensure that BJP gets the majority to "free the state from political instability".
Modi termed as "lies" Rahul Gandhi's allegations that the BJP was trying to amend acts that protect tribal land, days after the Congress leader alleged that efforts were on to change acts protecting such land.
In her election speeches, AICC president Sonia Gandhi claimed that a majority of tribals from Gujarat-- Modi's home state-- had migrated as they had lost land to "capitalists".
Polling for 13 out of the 81 Assembly had taken place on November 25.
Altogether 18 sitting MLAs, including ministers and BJP vice-president and former deputy chief minister Raghuvar Das (Jamshedpur-East) are seeking re-election.

The Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM-Prajatantrik) and Trinamool Congress are contesting after striking a pre-poll alliance with JVM, fielding candidates in 18 seats, conceding two seats for TMC in this phase.
The BJP, Congress and JVM have fielded four women candidates each.
Despite running the government after snapping ties, the JMM and Congress are contesting against each other in all the 20 constituencies.
Incumbent agriculture minister Banna Gupta (Jamshedpur -West), HRD minister Geetashree Oraon (Sisai), both from the Congress, and industry minister Champai Soren (Seraikella) are also trying their luck for re-election.
In the 20 seats that are going to polls in the second phase, BJP had eight, JMM five, Congress two and rest were held by Independent and other parties. Baharagora seat is vacant. Contesting for the fifth time from Kharsawan seat, leader of the opposition and ex-chief minister Arjun Munda is one of the prominent BJP candidates in the fray.
Madhu Koda, who has the distinction of ruling a state for the maximum period of 23 months as Independent MLA at the head of Congress/JMM/RJD supported UPA, is contesting from Majhgaon on the ticket of his Jai Bharat Samanta Party.
Koda's former Cabinet colleague Anosh Ekka, who is fighting from Kolebira constituency, is in judicial custody in connection with the killing of a para-teacher on November 26.
Ekka's wife Menon Ekka is contesting from Simdega.
Former ministers Bimla Pradhan (BJP), Dulal Bhuyan (Congress), Joba Manjhi (JMM), Niel Tirkey (JMM-Simdega) and Bandhu Tirkey are also trying their luck.

Cong  BJP modify agendas  PDP and NC shareplankWritten by Arun Sharma , Mir Ehsan | Jammu And Kashmir |
Posted: December 1, 2014 2:20 am
The national parties have made tactical shifts on key poll issues, the eye of each on constituencies loyal to the other. The regional parties, on the other hand, have stuck to their original planks of retaining Article 370 and removing the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act.
The shift for the BJP has been on Article 370; it has started talking of a discussion first rather than abrogating it. This is to woo voters in areas predominantly inhabited by Muslims, seen as a Congress constituency.
The Congress for its part, has taken a leaf out of the BJP book by promising “fully empowered” regional councils for both Jammu and Kashmir. Leh and Kargil already have autonomous hill development councils; it was so far the BJP that was demanding a council for Jammu. Now the Congress manifesto has promised separate councils for Muslim-dominated Peer Panchal valley as well as Chenab Valley. For hilly areas of Kashmir, it has assured development councils.
“The Congress promise is to regain ground it lost to the BJP in Hindu-dominated areas,” said trade union leader Koushal Sharma.
Among other new stands, the Congress has also promised to introduce a bill seeking constitution of a delimitation commission for assembly constituencies, which has not been done for 18 years. It has pointed out that the National Conference and PDP had opposed the move to bring such legislation during Ghulam Nabi Azad’s tenure as chief minister in 2006-08.
Between the PDP and the National Conference, meanwhile, there is little to choose on Article 370 or AFSPA. “The National Conference has always maintained the restoration of autonomy is the only viable solution to the Kashmir problem,’’ reads the NC manifesto. “Chief Minister Omar Abdullah has been consistently and vehemently advocating the revocation of AFSPA which the National Conference believes is no longer necessary…”
For its part, the PDP has pledged it will strengthen Article 370 if it wins the elections. “The special status enshrined in Article 370 is required to empower people of J&K and help deal with the issues of identity, borders and governance,” reads its manifesto. On AFSPA, the manifesto says the party would “review” the Disturbed Areas Act to “pave the way for revocation”.

Ebola-cured travellers must undergo body fluidtestsWritten by Utkarsh Anand | New Delhi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 2:19 am
The Union Health Ministry has asked Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) to issue advisory to all Indian missions abroad to ensure that a person cured of Ebola is allowed to travel to India only after all his body fluids have tested negative for the virus and after a period of 90 days have elapsed from the date that he or she has been considered cured of the deadly disease.
The latest screening measures have been proposed after traces of the virus were found in the semen of a 26-year-old man, who was said to have recovered from Ebola in Liberia and given a certificate of medical clearance from Liberian health authorities. The man is currently kept under isolation in the special health facility of Delhi airport.
After the incident, the Health Ministry held a review meeting with state health secretaries on November 21 where it was decided to revise the advisory.
Taking cue from the US government, the Health Ministry has also written to the Civil Aviation Secretary for “re-routing” passengers from West African countries, affected by Ebola, to some select airports in the country where intensive screening mechanism has been put in place. Seven airports across the country have been earmarked for such screening.
Meanwhile, the Home Secretary has been asked by the Health Ministry to make all travellers from the affected countries go through the mandatory health check before they are cleared through immigration.
As on November 13, a total of 691 passengers were under government’s surveillance programme. Of them 70 are belonged to high-risk cases, according to the ministry’s affidavit in the Supreme Court regarding government’s preparedness against Ebola. The SC, while admitting a PIL on the issue by Vineet Dhanda, had earlier issued notices to the Centre and states.

Let down by Mamatas TMC  Muslims flock to ShahsrallyWritten by Arshad Ali | Kolkata |
Posted: December 1, 2014 2:18 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 8:48 pm
Participation of Muslims in large numbers at BJP president Amit Shah’s rally here on Sunday is an encouraging sign for the saffron party in West Bengal, where votes from the minorities hold the key to forming a government.
Muslims who attended the rally complained that the Trinamool Congress government had let down the community as it did not fulfil its promises, and the BJP now appeared to them a viable option.
“We have been cheated so many times by so many political parties that we don’t believe anymore in what they said about the BJP. I am ready to test the BJP as well,” said 60-year-old Fazlur Rahman Mondal from Balurghat in South Dinajpore.
Safiqul Islam from Barasat in North 24 Parganas too said Muslims were misled by several political parties. “We have been brainwashed for too long. Now, we can see through what the previous ruling party had done and the present one is trying to do,” he said.
Some accused the Trinamool Congress of treating the community as a vote bank and favouring only influential Muslims. Md Alam from Mominpur, a Muslim-dominated locality in the city, said, “If one observed closely, one would see that the TMC was only handing over freebies to some of the influential Muslims and treating the rest of us only as vote bank.”
Rahidul Khan, Anarul Seikh and Mansad Khan, who belong to Saltola in Bankura, said they have defected from the TMC to the BJP because of internal clashes and bias in the Mamata Banerjee-led party. “We had to endure a lot of atrocities from our own party till we could not stand it,” said Rahidul. Anarul alleged:”In a housing project at our locality, those who already had homes were given homes, and we were deprived and homeless.”
“I defected because the TMC leaders there (in Bankura) are only busy filling their own pockets. They are not bothered about the people of the locality,” Mansad said.
In the rally, there were some like Mofizul Islam, who had initially started with the CPM, then moved the TMC and now has joined the BJP. “There is a lot of internal clash in the TMC at Arambagh which has made people very anti-Trinamool there. They are all looking for a change,” said Islam, a resident of Arambagh in Hooghly.
The recent clash in Makra village of Birbhum also appeared to a result of several Muslims shifting their allegiance from the Trinamool Congress to the BJP.
Danish Rahman from West Midnapore too thought the BJP deserved a chance. “We have been disappointed by the CPM and the TMC and have been fed by a lot of negativities by their leaders about the BJP. But, it cannot get any worse and so the BJP should be continued…

QE or not QE Spotlight on the ECB as inflationdipsBy: Reuters | Paris |
Posted: December 1, 2014 2:15 am
The ECB’s monthly rate meeting will focus minds this week on the debate over quantitative easing in the euro zone, as a series of data releases on both sides of the Atlantic sheds more light on European woes and US strength.
Final purchasing manager indices for Europe and the United States, US monthly jobs data and the European Central Bank’s updated forecasts will all provide clues to assessing the relative health of both regions.
The ECB staff inflation and growth estimates for the 18-nation single currency union are much awaited after data showed on Friday that inflation in the bloc was back to a five-year low, putting more pressure on the bank to take action.
Particular attention will be paid to internal debate within the ECB over quantitative easing and to ECB chief Mario Draghi’s comments on the data at his monthly news conference on Thursday, after his pledge to act to lift “excessively low” inflation.
The ECB is expected to leave key rates unchanged and wait for next year to decide whether to take the leap to government bond-buying.
A decision on QE may come as early as the first quarter, vice president Vitor Constancio said last week. But arch-hawk German ECB policymaker Jens Weidmann responded that there were “legal limits” on printing money to buy government bonds.
“The ECB’s communication has not always been crystal clear this year, but overall it has moved steadily towards a more dovish stance despite internal tensions within the Governing Council,” French bank Credit Agricole wrote in a note.
“We expect no sovereign QE announcement at the December 4 meeting but a more formal, albeit conditional commitment to broader asset purchases.”
Friday’s monthly US job figures will be the key data in the United States.
The unemployment rate fell to a six-year low in October, underscoring the economy’s resilience in the face of slowing global demand.
Wage growth remained tepid, though, suggesting little need for the Federal Reserve to hurry to start lifting interest rates.
On Thursday, the Bank of England looks set to keep interest rates on hold at a record low 0.5 per cent — that’s the unanimous expectation of analysts polled by Reuters.
The first hike in British interest rates is expected to come in the third quarter of 2015, six months later than previously thought, owing to low inflation, sluggish pay growth and a weak euro zone economy, a Reuters poll showed.
However China’s central bank will wait until fourth-quarter economic data is out and monitor US and Japanese monetary policy before considering any more rate cuts or easing, a central bank adviser said on Tuesday.
Falling oil prices will be another point of focus, after producer group OPEC decided not to cut crude production last week despite global oversupply.
Besides adding to Draghi’s headaches as it pushes inflation in Europe even lower, the fall in oil prices is also hurting the economies, currencies and financial markets of many producer countries.

Residents body  councillor spar over plan to shrink Sec 37parkBy: Express News Service | Chandigarh |
Posted: December 1, 2014 2:11 am
The work of widening a road in Sector 37, which will reduce the area of a park, has become a bone of contention between the residents’ welfare society and the local BJP councillor Arun Sood.
While residents allege that the park is being reduced to provide additional parking space to some persons, the councillor says that the road had become a bottleneck and was being widened on the demand of a majority of the residents. The road in front of houses 401 to 407 is being widened by shifting the railing about four yards inside the park where a toe wall is being constructed.
According to the Sector 37-A RWS, they had been opposing it from the beginning. The matter was discussed in a meeting held on November 16, where the body unanimously opposed it.
In a statement, the RWS said, “It has been confirmed by the area councillor that the railings on the boundary of the park are to be re-installed on a toe wall after shifting them four yards inside the park from their original place so that the space thus vacated could be utilised for parking of vehicles. In spite of protest against this move to benefit one or two house owners and causing loss to public property, the work is being carried out, and it would reduce the size of the park by approximately 600 square yards.”
B S Multani, society president, said, “Once the size of the park becomes less than 0.75 acre, it would not qualify for facilities like a walking track and lightpoints. After the meeting of our executive body, we contacted Arun Sood and requested him to ask the contractor to immediately stop the work. He assured us but nothing happened.”
Arun Sood, however, said, “The road is narrow and becomes a bottleneck at the place where the railing is being shifted. I got the work started after a majority of area residents approved it, and it is not being done to create parking space, but to widen the road.”
He added, “There is no foul play, the road widening is being done as per norms. The railing of the park can be at a distance of six feet from the road. In the presence of FOSWAC president BS Bittu, around 70 residents were called for a meeting where more than 60 residents were in favour of the project. One or two people, however, have made it a prestige issue and are going against the demand of the people. They said that instead of open voting, it should have been through a secret ballot.”

CBI official confirmed Sunday that the agency has closed its investigation in a preliminary enquiry launched against senior officials of Bharat Dynamics Limited for allegations of irregularities in award of a contract to a private power company for production of components for the indigenously developed Akash surface-to-air missile system.
The CBI was probing alleged violation of rules in the award of the over Rs 575 crore contract by senior BDL officials to the power company for producing self-propelled launcher (ASPL) for the missile system that was to be supplied to two army regiments.
The preliminary inquiry, which was being handled by the Hyderabad unit of CBI, has been closed due to lack of evidence to suggest corruption by the officers, CBI sources said.

To meat or not to meat is the question but IIT wont chickenoutWritten by Sumegha Gulati | New Delhi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 2:09 am
The chicken that ran off the menu at IIT-Delhi after April will be back on it from January.
The decision comes amid a request last month from Human Resource Ministry’s seeking views from IITs and IIMs on separate eating areas for vegetarians and non-vegetarians. IIT-Delhi had anyway gone meatless about five months ago citing “cost” factors.
Talks on whether to serve non-vegetarian food in the hostel mess began in February, after vegetarian students reportedly complained that they were “overpaying” for mess services. The house and mess secretaries of all hostels, accompanied by other student representatives, then met the director in April to discuss the matter.
“Till last semester, hostels served chicken up to thrice a week. Eggs were also served two-three days a week,” a student representative from Vindhyachal Boys’ hostel told Newsline. “All students pay the same mess charges. But the cost of paneer for example is lower than chicken’s. So the vegetarian students complained that they were being overcharged.”
He said it was then decided that the hostel mess would stop serving chicken. Eggs were retained as many vegetarians also eat them. He said the decision was taken “purely” on economic grounds.
For those who still wanted to eat meat, the institute proposed that an additional cost of Rs 40 per 200 grams of chicken would be added to the food bill. This proposal is going to be implemented after classes begin in the new year.
Satya Chaitanya, house secretary of Girnar Boys’ hostel, said the proposal had left the majority “unconvinced” as more than 60 per cent students in his hostel  are non-vegetarians.
“How could the management simply take meat off the menu? For the last five months, we have got no non-veg food in the mess. Moreover, the food is prepared in-house but as per the proposal, a vendor would now supply the non-veg food.”
Meat-eaters, however, have had options. Apart from the regular dining hall, students have two other options. Each hostel runs a night mess where snacks — veg and non-veg — are served.
Then there are kiosks run by Nescafe, Himachal Pradesh state government and private owners on the campus.
“Apart from these, there are three more canteens on the campus and one staff cafeteria where students are also allowed to eat. All these still provide non-vegetarian food,” Abhishek Arora, a third-year student, said.

Centre begins process for selecting first chief of BRICS developmentbankWritten by Surabhi | New Delhi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 2:07 am
India has initiated discussions on appointment of the president of the proposed BRICS development bank.
“The thought process on appointing the first president of the BRICS Bank has begun. The government is considering two options — we can either set up a search committee or advertise for the post,” said a source familiar with the development.
He however, said that a search committee may be the more likely route taken. “It usually makes more ense to set up a search committee as advertising for such a high profile post may not bring the desired candidates,” he further said, adding that a final call on the process will be taken by the Union Cabinet.
The five-nation bloc of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa had agreed at the Sixth BRICS Summit in Brazil that the New Development Bank would be set up with its headquarters in China with India getting the right to nominate the president.
The proposed bank with a $50 billion capital structure is expected to be an alternative to other multi-lateral agencies and will be focussed on development agenda in the BRICS countries.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi had at the BRICS leaders’ summit (on the sidelines of the G20 Summit) in Brisbane earlier this month suggested that the bank should be inaugurated by 2016.
The decisions on the location of the headquarters as well as the appointment of the president and vice-president of the bank will be taken up when finance ministers of BRICS countries meet for the seventh summit in Russia in July 2015.
The Chinese government is understood to have shortlisted some locations in Shanghai that could serve as the headquarters for the bank.
“We will start work on the appointment soon. The ratification of the bank by member countries is still in process and has got slightly delayed because of the new government formation in Brazil,” the source said.
Once the ratification is done by all five member countries, the board of directors of the bank will be appointed with each member nominating one director.
India will then designate the president, who will be formally ratified by the member nations and then appointed.

Justin Sullivan / Getty Images North AmericaThe best time to buy holiday airfare is...

Travelers wait in line to check in for their flights at San Francisco International Airport November two days before Thanksgiving.
When it comes to holiday travel, there are certain things you can always count on. Security waits will be interminable, planes will be packed and millions of procrastinating people will ponder the age-old question of when is the best time to buy airfare.
If you have to ask, you’re probably already too late.
“People always feel like the holidays are a long way away but the longer you wait, the more you’re likely to spend,” said Patrick Surry, chief data scientist for Hopper.com, an airfare-pricing website. 
Furthermore, he notes, the typical consumer searches for flights for up to two weeks, incurring another five percent in “procrastination costs” between the time they start looking and the time they decide to buy.
Take Thanksgiving travel. Analyzing 2013 pricing data, the number crunchers at Orbitz determined that the best day to buy this year was Oct. 10, with average fares available through Oct. 21. However, when their counterparts at Kayak ran their numbers, they determined that average fares were actually lower in mid-November than mid-October. Surry’s research showed prices were relatively flat throughout the period before spiking 10 days before the holiday.
The data for Christmas isn’t much clearer. Orbitz says you’d have gotten the best deal if you’d bought in early October while Hopper says you could’ve waited until around Halloween. For those who haven’t pulled the trigger yet, both Kayak and Travelocity suggest a second window for deals may open in early December.
While disappointing for deal-hunters, the discrepancies shouldn’t be surprising. The size and incredible complexity of the system — non-stops vs. connecting flights, price vs. convenience bookings and a near-infinite array of city pairs — makes apples-to-oranges comparisons across the system almost impossible. 
Bottom line: Finding a deal has more to do with what’s happening with bookings for your particular flight and route than the system overall.
Video: A firm that processes tickets for travel agents, dealing with about half of all airline tickets, found that Sundays had the lowest average airfares of the week.
“The thing we’ve discovered looking at all these prices is that there is no easy answer,” said Surry. “You really have to research each particular trip.”
That reality also applies to the age-old debate about what day of the week offers the best deals. For years, conventional wisdom has had it that Tuesday was your best bet as airline executives played Monday-morning quarterback over slow weekend sales and offered up quick sales to fill seats.
In September, however, Airlines Reporting Corp., which handles ticket sales for travel agencies and other third-party sellers, threw that logic for a loop when it released a report showing that the cheapest fares are not found on Tuesday, but over the weekend.
The report , which looked at nearly 130 million ticket sales between January 2013 and July 2014 found that the lowest fares were actually found on Sunday, when the average price was $432, 13 percent lower than Tuesday’s $497. Saturday came in second at $439.
Alas, this may be yet another case of apples and oranges as the Tuesday figure no doubt includes plenty of business travelers booking last-minute, high-priced tickets while weekend bookings are dominated by leisure travelers looking for the lowest possible fare. Thus, average fares purchased on weekends are bound to be lower.
Or not. According to an as-yet-unpublished Hopper analysis, the average cheapest time to buy a ticket is between midnight Tuesday and 1 a.m. Wednesday. Looking at 20 million searches over the last four months, the company determined that prices during that period were 2.5 percent below average. Unfortunately, the data also revealed that that only applied to 1.6 percent of the markets studied.
Needless to say, that scenario is even less likely to play out during the holidays, when filling empty seats isn’t an issue.
On the other hand, it’s never too early to start thinking about Thanksgiving... 2015.

Bill replacing coal ordinance to be brought in Parliament this week

Coal India Limited
(The coal blocks allocation…)
NEW DELHI: A bill seeking to replace the coal blocks allocation ordinance that unveiled the NDA government's ambitious coal sector reforms will be brought in Parliament this week.
Introduction as well as consideration and passage of two bills to replace two ordinances pertaining to coal blocks allocation and textile undertakings is on the government agenda this week.
The coal blocks allocation ordinance was brought in the wake of the Supreme Court decision cancelling 214 coal blocks in September.
The government promulgated Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Ordinance, 2014 in October to facilitate auctioning of the cancelled coal blocks.
Incidentally, the coal ordinance has been opposed by the central trade unions, including RSS-affiliated trade union Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS).
BMS as also AITUC, CITU, HMS and INTUC have jointly opposed the government's proposal to allow private players to mine coal and sell it in the open market, a right till now reserved with the state-owned Coal India Limited (CIL).
The ordinance has also come under attack from the Left parties.
The bill seeking to replace Textile Undertakings (Nationalisation) Laws (Amendment and Validation) Ordinance, 2014 is being introduced in Lok Sabha tomorrow and will also be moved for consideration immediately thereafter.
The ordinance was brought to shield the National Textile Corporation from rent control laws that have been used to evict its sick textile units from prime land in several cities.

Social media angst needs active helpprint
I woke up on Sunday morning to find a number of my Facebook friends – some of them very learned --- updating their status messages with what looked like a safety clause in a lawsuit. It read: “Due to the fact that Facebook has chosen to involve software that will allow the theft of my personal information, I do declare the following: on this day, November 29,2014, in response to the new Facebook guidelines and under articles L.111, 112 and 113 of the code of intellectual property, I declare that my rights are attached to all my personal data, drawings, paintings, photos, texts etc... published on my profile. For commercial use of the foregoing my written consent is required at all times.”
The Facebook spokesperson said it was a hoax and helpfully mailed me the company’s new data policy with all details on privacy, settings and all that. A Google search also revealed that it was “pointless garbage” or a “hoax” playing on privacy and intellectual property linked fears — and these clarifications happened two years ago!
However, the simple fact is that social media and user generated content are a complex subject. Since the content in question can be used/abused in many ways (think cut-and-paste theft, tagging, cyberstalking, intrusive advertising research), paranoia will be a frequently occurring thing. I joke often that user-generated content is “loser generated content” as content creators do not get rewarded, while they fear copyright theft or violation of privacy.
Fancy algorithms and data mining techniques are the 21st Century’s Big Brothers.
Companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter are the new global bureaucracies, and the way they communicate needs to improve a lot – in style, simplicity, frequency and pro-activeness. If not, people will fear the worst.

JSW Steel defers acquisition of Italy's Lucchini SpV

(In September, Jindal had…)
KOLKATA: JSW Steel Ltd, the third largest Indian Steel maker, today said it has deferred the proposed acquisition of Italy's Lucchini SpV .
"For the time being, plans for India is much stronger and larger. We want to focus in India.... We have deferred our decision to invest in the Italian project," JSW Steel chairman and managing director Sajjan Jindal said.
He was speaking on the sidelines of inauguration of Ispat Pragati Bhawan, the new office of Institute of Steel Development & Growth (Insdag) in the city.
In September, Jindal had told reporters that JSW has offered less than USD 100 million for three mills of the insolvent Lucchini and it was in a position to win it.
The company recently also gave a clarification in the bourses saying, "In line with our long term strategy to acquire finishing mills near to the market, we have submitted a binding bid for takeover of Rolling Mills of the Piombini Plant of Lucchini in Italy subject to certain terms and conditions. We are yet to get the response on this bid."
Lucchini, with a steel capacity of about 2.5 mt, was owned by Russia's Severstal but had to be declared insolvent in 2012 following which the government placed it under special administration and started the process to find buyers.
JSW currently has a total installed steel making capacity of 14.3 million tonnes in India.

New Yorker s Ferguson Cover Speaks Volumesreddit
The New Yorker revealed its Dec. 8 cover image in the midst of unrest in Ferguson , Missouri.
The cover depicts a distorted version of the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, broken into two parts -- one black, one white.
“I wanted to comment on the tragic rift that we’re witnessing,” illustrator Bob Staake said . “I lived in St. Louis for seventeen years before moving to Massachusetts, so watching the news right now breaks my heart. At first glance, one might see a representation of the Gateway Arch as split and divided, but my hope is that the events in Ferguson will provide a bridge and an opportunity for the city, and also for the country, to learn and come together.”
Protests raged in Ferguson and across the nation this week in the wake of Monday night's announcement that police officer Darren Wilson would not be indicted for the death of Michael Brown. Wilson, who is white, shot and killed Brown, a black teenager, on Aug. 9.

Father Of 14-Year-Old Child Bride Asks Nigerian Court To Spare Her LifeWasilat Tasi'u, 14-Year-Old Nigerian Girl, Sentenced To Death For Murdering Husband
 | By                                                                IBRAHIM GARBA and CHIKA ODUAH

KANO, Nigeria (AP) — The father of a 14-year-old child bride accused of murdering her husband said Thursday he was appealing to a Nigerian court to spare his daughter the death sentence.
Wasilat Tasi'u is on trial for the murder of her 35-year-old husband, Umar Sani, who died after eating food that Tasi'u allegedly laced with rat poison.
"We are appealing to the judge to consider Wasilat's plea," her father, Isyaku Tasi'u, told The Associated Press on Thursday.
On Wednesday witnesses told the High Court in Gezawa, a town 60 miles outside Nigeria's second largest city of Kano, that Tasi'u killed her husband two weeks after their wedding in April. Three others allegedly died after eating the poisoned meal.
The prosecution, led by Lamido Soron-Dinki, senior state council from the Kano State Ministry of Justice, is seeking the death penalty.
The case calls into question the legality of trying a 14-year-old for murder under criminal law and the rights of child brides, who are common in the poverty-stricken, predominantly Muslim northern Nigeria region.
"She was married to a man that she didn't love. She protested but her parents forced her to marry him," Zubeida Nagee, a women's rights activist in Kano, told AP. Nagee and other activists have written a letter of protest to the Kano state deputy governor.
Nagee said Tasi'u was a victim of systematic abuse endured by millions of girls in the region. Activists say the blend of traditional customs, Islamic law and Nigeria's constitutional law poses a challenge when advocating for the rights of young girls in Nigeria.
Justice Mohammed Yahaya adjourned the court until December 22. Tasi'u is in state juvenile custody.

BillOReilly.com on Ferguson: Racial profiling understandableBy Erik Wemple November 29 Follow @ErikWemple
Bill O’Reilly of Fox News (Frank Micelotta/Associated Press)
When issues of crime and race emerge, Bill O’Reilly feels most comfortable. In the aftermath of the Trayvon Martin killing, O’Reilly railed against hoodies and “gangsta” culture. And after Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson, Mo., in August, O’Reilly fought back all notions that there’s a culture of white privilege in the United States. He famously debated that particular contention in an appearance this fall on Jon Stewart’s “Daily Show. ”
Now that a grand jury in St. Louis County has declined to indict Officer Darren Wilson in the killing of 18-year-old Brown, O’Reilly is back on the beat. Yesterday a column titled “Ferguson, Truth, and The End of Time” surfaced on BillOReilly.com . The piece carried a peculiar byline — “BillOReilly.com Staff” — which may or may not include “Bill O’Reilly,” though the opinions contained within it sound a lot like those of a certain King of Cable News.
The thrust is a slap at a column in Time magazine by Darlena Cunha defending the role of rioting in expediting social change. Time magazine, argues BillOReilly.com Staff, has become “irrelevant,” though not so irrelevant that BillOReilly.com Staff doesn’t flinch at devoting precious column inches to rebutting it: “Let’s start by calling out Time Magazine for publishing garbage,” notes the column. “The aforementioned Darlena Cunha asks a question in her execrable column: ‘Is rioting so wrong?’ Yes, Ms. Cunha, it is. And nearly as wrong was Time’s decision to publish your incendiary diatribe.”
Cunha argues that racism is “still alive and well throughout our nation” — which is the sort of contention that short-circuits a guy like Bill O’Reilly, not to mention BillOReilly.com Staff. And so the column riffs:
To be fair, most Americans recognize that young black men are often viewed with more suspicion than, say, young Asian men. Not just by cops, but by shop owners and people walking down the street. Is it fair? No. But is it at least in part understandable? Of course.
All one has to do is examine a few stats. As the brave black columnist Jason Riley points out, blacks commit violent crimes at about ten times the rate of whites. Blame it on poverty or lack of education or anything else that makes you feel better, but the fact remains that black criminality is disproportionately high.
Bold text added to highlight a pernicious word. In stating that it’s “understandable” to profile young black men, BillOReilly.com Staff is essentially issuing a permission of sorts — permission to generalize, permission to stereotype, permission to propagate “the annihilation of the black individual.”
That last quote comes from an essay by the Atlantic’s Ta-Nehisi Coates in rebuttal to a column by The Washington Post’s Richard Cohen defending stop-and-frisk policing policies that weigh heavily on young black males. Coates wrote of such notions:
They hold that neither I, nor my twelve year old son, nor any of my nephews, nor any of my male family members deserve to be judged as individuals by the state. Instead we must be seen as members of a class more inclined to criminality. It does not matter that the vast, vast majority of black men commit no violent crime at all.
That sounds pretty “understandable” too, no?

Costliest riots ever were in Los Angeles in 1992; Chicago 1968 incident makes Top 10
Businesses should check if their insurance covers riots, industry executive says
Ferguson: Most commercial insurance should cover riots, industry executives say
The images were inescapable: businesses in Ferguson, Mo., damaged or destroyed by rioting in the wake of the Michael Brown grand jury decision.
What happens now to those livelihoods?
Small-business owners who had what are commonly called a "business owners policy" might be covered for damages, including broken windows and stolen property, from civil disobedience, says Ted Devine, chief executive of Chicago-based Insureon, an online site for small businesses seeking property and casualty insurance coverage.
The 10 most-costly riots in the U.S. Read the story
But "it's a good idea to explicitly ask your insurance agent whether that coverage is included," he said. Business owners policies can include many different types of coverage, and policies can differ depending on the size of the business, location, property and industry
Typically, a business owners policy includes general liability coverage, which is insurance for what the policyholder is legally obligated to pay because of bodily injury or property damage caused to another person.
The policy might also include "business interruption insurance" that's triggered by civil unrest; that would provide income to a business whose operations are halted because of property damage from rioting. Fire damage caused by protesters would be covered by the fire-civil unrest portion of the property coverage, said Devine, a former Aon executive.
The costliest riots occurred in Los Angeles in 1992, according to data on the Insurance Information Institute's website. Those riots resulted in $1.3 billion in insured damages in 2013 dollars. Among the 10 costliest civil disorders on record, seven occurred in the 1960s, according to the industry trade group. One in Chicago in April 1968 cost what is now the equivalent of $87 million in damages. That incident ranks ninth.
@RobertLop46 I agree as I said they should have sprayed Gatling guns my pepper spray into that riot Do us all a favor and eliminate future problems

Last summer, Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, was shot and killed by a white police officer in suburban St. Louis. Rioting ensued; the St. Louis Post-Dispatch said 28 businesses were reported to have been burglarized Aug. 10, the first night of unrest after the Brown shooting. One local insurance adjuster who processed three claims estimated damages were no more than $5 million.
For comparison's sake, the newspaper said, a 2012 St. Louis hailstorm saw insured damages of about $1.2 billion.
Devine said that, in the months between the Brown shooting and the grand-jury decision, agents hadn't seen Ferguson businesses having major problems getting business owners policies with civil unrest coverage.
"But it is possible that premiums will change to reflect recent events," Devine said.
More rioting occurred after a grand jury decision Monday night in which Officer Darren Wilson wasn't indicted in Brown's death.
A business owners policy might give the option of two kinds of property insurance, Devine said.
One is a "named-perils policy." That covers losses resulting from specific events named in the policy.
A second is an "all-risk policy." That covers all events except those specifically named in the policy.
"A lot of the businesses we serve — small businesses — get a business owners policy with a $500 annual premium with a per-occurrence limit, or total payout possible for any single claim, of $1 million and an aggregate limit, or a total payout possible for the duration of the policy, usually a year, of $2 million," Devine said.
Loretta Worters, an Insurance Information Institute spokeswoman, said both commercial property insurance and homeowners policies generally include coverage for losses caused by riots.
The rioting definition covers looting by people who steal merchandise or other property from the premises, as well as fire. Vandalism is also covered, she said.
As for businesses that must suspend operations or limit hours because of rioting, business income coverage — also known as business interruption — is only triggered if there is direct physical damage to the premises, forcing the business to suspend its operations.
If police or fire departments bar people from an area, there is generally coverage for lost business income and extra expense through a "civil authority provision" — if the business had that provision, Worters said. That includes curfews and other restrictions on access to a business.
Then there is car insurance.
"If the business or auto owner has comprehensive on their policy, it will pay for vandalism, including fire," Worters said. Comprehensive coverage is the portion of an auto insurance policy that covers damage to a car not involving a collision with another vehicle. That would include damage from fire, explosions, earthquakes, floods, riots and theft.
Worters said the Insurance Information Institute doesn't yet have estimates on insured losses related to the Ferguson riots.

Snooki got married (and there was no leopard print in sight)By Sarah Kaplan November 30 Follow @sarahkaplan48

Oh, Snooki. It seems only yesterday you were making calls on the duck phone and tending your pouf at the “Jersey Shore” house. And now you’re a wife.
Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi (27) was pouf-less at her wedding to Jionni LaValle (also 27), her longtime boyfriend and father of her two children. Instead, the reality star says she was going for a “Great Gatsby”-theme look for the event Saturday. (Whether she achieved it, well, we won’t ask F. Scott Fitzgerald.) We’ve got answers to five more pressing questions you didn’t know you had about the reality star’s New Jersey wedding.
1. What did she wear?
Well, it wasn’t animal print.
“To be honest with you, I’m kind of over that leopard stage,” Polizzi said on a July episode of her podcast, “Naturally Nicole.” “It’s not 2010 anymore.”
Instead, the bride wore a more traditional lace gown for the ceremony (“My Cinderella dress,” she told NJ.com) and a white, strapless mermaid dress for the Jazz Age-theme reception.
“I evolved into this vintage, classic and timeless person, which is freaking weird,” she said on the podcast.
2. Who is the groom?
He’s not a “Jersey Shore” alum, but he is a Jersey boy. Jionni LaValle is an East Hanover, N.J., native who met Polizzi while she was still filming the reality show in 2010, according to US Weekly . By 2011, Polizzi said  on “Good Morning America” that, while she wasn’t ready to get married, “I’m so down to making guido babies with him.”
The couple announced their engagement in 2012 while Polizzi was pregnant with their first child, Lorenzo. Their daughter, Giovanna, was born this September.
3. Where was the wedding?
In New Jersey, of course. The ceremony was held at St. Rose of Lima Roman Catholic church in East Hanover, N.J., and followed by a reception at the Venetian banquet hall in nearby Garfield. 
4. Did the Seaside Heights crew attend?
Yep! According to NJ.com , among Polizzi’s 15 bridesmaids were fellow “Jersey Shore” alums Jenni “JWoww” Farley, Sammi Giancola and Deena Cortese. (Farley, who is now Polizzi’s co-star in “Snooki and JWoww,” was the maid of honor.) Paul “DJ Pauly D” DelVecchio also posted an Instagram of himself dressed for the event Saturday.  
5. What about the kids?
Finding ways to feature the whole family seems to be a trend at celebrity weddings these days, and Polizzi’s was no exception. Two-year-old Lorenzo preceded the bride down the aisle holding a sign that read, “Daddy, here comes Mommy,” according to E! News . (No news as to whether Polizzi had to bribe her son with a candy bar, a tactic she apparently considered.) Meanwhile, baby Giovanna was pushed down the aisle in a stroller.

Wall Street week ahead: As energy shares tumble, opportunity lurks
Reuters Dec 1, 2014, 12.30AM IST
(An index of oil and gas exploration…)
NEW YORK: Shale stocks have been hard-hit as investors see margins all but evaporating following the slide in crude oil prices, but the U.S. shale energy boom is not over.
An index of oil and gas exploration and production tumbled 8.15 per cent on Friday as US crude fell almost 10 per cent to around $66.36 per barrel to hit its lowest in 4-1/2 years.
The slide came the day after oil cartel OPEC decided not to cut output in a meeting in Vienna. Prior to the decision, Saudi officials were reported as saying the kingdom, with its large currency reserves, was prepared to withstand oil prices as low as $70-$80 per barrel for up to a year.
But the weaker shale players may not have that long.
"We do not know if OPEC has ulterior motives to let oil prices drift lower and pinch the global (exploration and production) sector, or if reaching a consensus on cuts was just too challenging," wrote Wells Fargo Securities in a Friday client note. "What is clear is that lower cash flows are highly likely to translate into lower E&P spending."
US crude prices were catching up to Thursday's action in Brent as markets across the United States were closed for the Thanksgiving holiday. Friday's was a half-day session.
"We'll wait to see the trend next week when there's full market volume, however it's clear that as oil prices come down there will be pressure for the weaker of the companies in the sector, particularly exploration and the ones that are highly indebted," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.
The overall energy sector of the S&P 500 fell 6.3 per cent on Friday, adding to its year-to-date losses, now at 10.3 per cent.
Fourteen of the sector's more than 40 stocks are within 2 per cent of a 52-week low and the sector's weighting on the S&P 500 has dropped to single digits, closing below 8 per cent after Friday's shellacking, according to Reuters data.
Nearly 90 per cent of the sector's shares are trading below their 100-day moving average.
However, the sharp declines also create an opportunity.
"We recently moved from an underweight to a neutral weight rating in energy, so directionally we agree with the idea that this weakness is a buying opportunity, but it is very hard to tell where the bottom is," said Tony Roth, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust in Wilmington, Delaware.
"Crude seems to have no floor right now, and we could easily see the price drop into the low $60s."
With the big stock price drops, others see a run to consolidation. The sector subindex is down 12 per cent in 2014, with year-to-date losses of more than 20 per cent in seven companies.
"I think we'll see some healthy consolidation take place," said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin.
"Some may wither on the vine, but technology has improved to make it profitable to extract at a lower price point than last year. As a result, we'll probably see some opportunistic buying."
Jacobsen and Krosby said the slide in oil prices and the sector's shares does not mean the boom in the energy sector in the United States is ending, but will likely enter a new stage of development.
"The renaissance isn't over," said Jacobsen. "It's just maturing."

LaRon Landry wears Sean Taylor-style tape on his face mask(via @ATBechtold )
LaRon Landry was a rookie safety in Washington the year Sean Taylor was shot and killed. Taylor and Landry were thought to be the Redskins safeties of the future, but Taylor’s career was cut short by tragedy, and Landry lasted just five injury-plagued seasons in Washington.
Sunday, the Redskins faced Landry, now with the Colts, his third NFL team. And Landry’s face mask sure seemed to be set up as a tribute to Taylor.
The original taped-face-mask thing happened in 2005, after Taylor and Clinton Portis had been fined for wearing outlandish socks during a game. Via NFL Network’s Taylor film :
“It did, quite frankly, piss me off,” then-defensive coordinator Gregg Williams says in the film. “I confronted him about it. And he goes out the next week and took 40, 50 pieces of tape, and just taped up his face mask, which you can’t do. And I told the equipment manager, ‘Take the face mask off, get it off before he goes out there [and] gets another fine.’
“So they put [the taped up face mask] in my locker,” Williams says, showing off the piece, which he has apparently kept for a decade. “And I’ll be damned if he didn’t go ahead and tape up the one they put on anyway. And he still went ahead and got fined.”
There’s quite a resemblance here.

He spells out his ambition: This power will rulestateWritten by Bashaarat Masood | Handwara |
Posted: December 1, 2014 2:43 am
Sajad Lone’s speeches have left no one in doubt that he is projecting himself as chief minister. “I promise I will not let this power (his audience) go waste,” he told a huge crowd at his last campaign rally Sunday. “This power will rule the state.”
A meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made Lone the target of his opponents while the candidate himself is trying to use it to his advantage. “I met Modi and everybody has gone against me. I met him, do you support this?” he said; the crowd cheered. “Everybody has gone against me, and I feared I had done something wrong, but you have supported me once again.”
“His meeting will Modi will help him and help us,” says Ghulam Hassan Kar of Handwara. “He needs money for development and everybody knows that will come from the Centre.”
Sajad took on Omar Abdullah: “You say I will demolish mosques to make mandirs. There is no mandir in my house, but in your house. Babri Masjid was demolished in 1992. And six years after that you were a minister in BJP government.”
On Saturday, Omar had said Sajad is an enemy of Article 370. Lone replied, “My brother, whatever damage Article 370 has seen, it is because of you, your party and your father… If I need to sacrifice my life to defend Article 370, I will do it happily.”
He invoked the name of his father Abdul Gani Lone, the slain Hurriyat chairman. “I never thought that I would once sit in the chair where my martyred father used to sit,” he said. “I have a dream, you have to promise you will fulfil it. I should have the highest number of votes in the state.”

SIMI-linked doctor behind Andhra youths recruitment forISWritten by Johnson T A | Bangalore |
Posted: December 1, 2014 2:43 am
A doctor formerly associated with SIMI and currently based in the Gulf has been identified by security agencies as one of the persons involved in two recent attempts to recruit youths from Hyderabad for the Islamic State operating in Syria and Iraq.
According to sources familiar with the electronic investigations in the two cases, the online recruiter involved in the alleged attempt to lure a former Google employee and four Hyderabadi youths brought back from the Bangladesh border was the same doctor.
The name of this alleged recruiter had featured earlier in investigations into activities of the banned SIMI in Karnataka in 2007 but he had not been booked at the time. Officials said the medical doctor is in touch with Indian-origin persons such as cleric Sultan Armar, who is linked to the Indian Mujahideen and al-Qaeda.
The details about the doctor have reportedly been revealed by the four Hyderabadi youths intercepted in September in West Bengal’s Malda. Sources said monitoring of the online communications of the recruiter showed he was in touch with youths in different parts of the country, identified via their activities on jihadi sites and social media.
The doctor is alleged to have put the four Hyderabadi youths intercepted in September in touch with Armar, a cleric from Bhatkal in Karnataka who also goes by the name ‘Maulana Abdul Rehman al Nadwi al Hindi’ on the Net. Before the Hyderabad police caught up with the youths, Armar had allegedly spoken to them over Skype and promised to arrange their travel to Afghanistan.
The doctor, sources said, also provided the youths money to enable them to procure visas to travel via Turkey to Syria to join the IS.
The former Google employee, a software engineer also allegedly tapped by the doctor, caught the attention of investigators because of his online activities and for obtaining a work visa recently to travel to Saudi Arabia.
Two SIMI-linked men from Maharashtra arrested by the Hyderabad police recently were allegedly also recruited by Armar to join al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. According to sources, one of them had obtained a visa for travel to Iran.
Looking at measures to prevent youths from getting attracted to the IS and other jihadi outfits abroad, security agencies in India have also been looking at other data apart from Net monitoring.
Some agencies in Karnataka have identified young travellers to the Gulf region or West Asia in recent months who have failed to return after the lapse of their visas. “This has given us a shortlist of a handful of candidates who fit the profile of those who may join the IS, but there is no confirmation. Their families say they have gone in search of jobs, so they could be illegal immigrants abroad as well,” a senior police official said.

Malaria outbreak hits anti-NaxalopsBy: Express News Service | Raipur |
Posted: December 1, 2014 2:41 am
An outbreak of malaria in Bastar has severely impacted the security forces on the Naxal front. At least one policeman, Govind Tamga, has died and over 400 have been affected by the disease in the last 10 days. Besides the personnel, a huge number of villagers have been hit by the disease.
The situation is compounded by the lack of medicare in Bastar as the region has only one major hospital in Jagdalpur, which lacks capacity to treat the influx of patients. The male ward of the hospital is brimming over and over 50 personnel of the state police and the CRPF have to lie on the floor. The Bastar IG has asked the government to provide immediate help.
“Our operations have been affected. We have asked the state government to immediately take note of the situation and ensure medicare for policemen,” said IG S R P Kalluri.
“We have given special instructions to our forces posted in sensitive areas,” he said.
Such has been the impact that at least two anti-Naxal operations in the region were to be curtailed last week as the personnel were hit by the disease in forests, forcing the commanding officers to order an immediate retreat.
Bastar’s malaria officer Sanjay Basak said the sudden outbreak of malaria is a serious issue. “So far we were giving them chloroquine and primaquine for malaria, but these have proved ineffective. We have taken advice from the WHO’s officers about other medicines,” he added.
While some policemen, whose condition turned serious, have been airlifted to Raipur, at least 200 are still in police camps of interior areas and yet to receive medicare.
Speaking to TV reporters, the personnel admitted  to hospital said they were not given proper care and were forced to spend on their own.

No political pressure  event to highlight Rajas life: AMUV-CBy: Express News Service | Aligrah |
Posted: December 1, 2014 2:38 am
A day after AMU students union accused the Vice-Chancellor of succumbing to “pressure of BJP government” by deciding to hold a seminar on Raja Mahendra Pratap, the latter Sunday rejected the charge as a “misconception”.
“Some sections of the university community may harbour the misconception that I took this decision on Friday under pressure from the central government. This is patently false,” V-C Zameer Uddin Shah said.
He said the decision to hold the seminar springs entirely from “my intent to highlight those heroes of India’s freedom movement whose contributions have been forgotten by us today”. Shah said the seminar will be be held “at AMU at an early date despite some reservations on this move by some student leaders”.
The students’ union had Saturday passed a resolution terming the V-C’s decision as arbitrary and one that was “taken to please the leaders of a particular party”. AMUSU president Abdullah Azzam had said they were not opposed to the seminar, “but fear that the NDA government is trying to erode the autonomy of this institution. This is something which spells danger not only for the AMU.”

For nine years, their families exchanged sweets on Diwali as well as Eid. But relations had soured ever since the duo said they love each other and expressed the willingness to marry. They continued to meet despite warnings till on Saturday, Sonu was hacked to death while Dhanishta’s throat was slit, allegedly by her brothers.
The incident took place at Kuchesar Chopla village in Hapur, nearly 60km from Delhi. Muslims comprise 25 per cent of the area’s population. Of the remaining Hindus, 25 per cent are Dalits.
Sonu and Dhanistha had been meeting regularly for the past two years and had decided to marry. When Sonu approached his family, they reportedly sent him to Delhi where he worked at a welding factory. Back in Kuchesar, Dhanistha’s brothers and mother asked her to stay away from Sonu and began finding a match for her.
Police sources said the two spoke over phone and met whenever Sonu came to Hapur.
A few days before Diwali, Sonu returned to Hapur and took Dhanistha to Ghaziabad court where they reportedly married, police said. The two continued to live with their families. Police said the families soon found out and asked them to stay apart. When the warnings didn’t work, the families approached the village elders.
Village Pradhan Manoj Kumar said: “On Friday, Dhanistha’s brother came to my house, asking me to intervene. I asked him to call a Muslim representative, but he refused, saying that if he took it up with the community, the matter would get out of hand. I met the two families at Dhanistha’s house Friday. While Sonu confessed to their marriage, Dhanistha denied it and said she did not want to be with Sonu. Perhaps, her family forced her to say this. I told them to settle the matter and allow the children to live the way they wished to”.
However, a relative present at the meeting said:  “The diktat was clear. The two had been asked to stay apart for fear that the matter could turn communal”.
Hapur SP R P Pandey said the couple eloped the same night. “When they returned around 10am on Saturday, the girl’s brothers killed them in the presence of all villagers. We have arrested Dhanistha’s mother Noor Jehan and her brother Talib, based on a statement by Sonu’s father Satyavan. The remaining four brothers named in the FIR are absconding.”
In her statement to police, eyewitness Anita said: “It was the girl’s mother who asked her sons to kill Sonu. We were too scared to so anything.”
Satyavan said: “During Friday’s meeting, the Pradhan asked the girl if she had married my son, but she refused. Sonu had then agreed to stay away from her. I was on my way to get continued…

Indias spy agencies more toothless thaneverWritten by Praveen Swami | New Delhi |

In the spring of 2009, even as municipal crews in Mumbai were still sifting through the debris of 26/11, India’s newly-appointed home minister, P Chidambaram, was ushered into the digital heart of the United States’ war against terrorism, its super-secret National Counter-Terrorism Centre. He gazed intently, an aide recalls, at its giant video-walls, where information from across the world displayed in real time, and asked searching questions about the dozens of classified databases that feed them.
Later that year, Chidambaram promised a made-in-India NCTC would be up and running “by the end of 2010”- a third of the time it had taken the United States. “India cannot afford to wait 36 months”, he declaimed.
Indians waited that, and longer-and while they did, the foundations on which India’s intelligence services have been rotting. The Intelligence Bureau, highly-placed government sources said, is over 30% short of staff-particularly critical mid-level executive positions. For its part, the Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW), tasked with securing Indian interests across the world, has desperate shortages of specialists in languages and the sciences-deficits that are running as high as 40% in critical departments.
Later this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to make his first appointment to lead the Intelligence Bureau. He is expected to choose from among Ashok Prasad, who helped build the organisation’s counter-terrorism data-hub, the Multi-Agency Centre, D P Sinha, a veteran of anti-terror operations, and Dineshwar Sharma, a quiet but highly respected analyst, who won his spurs when he volunteered to serve in Jammu and Kashmir in the early 1990s.
The Prime Minister will also have to find a leader to rebuild R&AW-devastated by internal feuds, staff shortages and technology deficits. He is expected to choose between Rajinder Khanna, the leader of R&AW’s counter-terrorism efforts in recent years, and Arvind Saxena, a veteran with long experience of Pakistan, the United States and organisational management.
Too few spies
Figures released to Parliament by the United Progressive Alliance government show that even as Chidambaram’s efforts to create new institutions became the focus of official efforts, staffing deficits became endemic across the intelligence services. In March 2013, then Minister of State for Home R P N Singh told Parliament that the IB had 18,795 personnel on its rolls, against a sanctioned strength of 26,867 – in other words, a shortfall of over 30 per cent, and that based on manpower requirements drawn up in the 1970s.
The effects are evident across the states: dedicated counter-terrorism groups set up by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, while he was Intelligence Bureau chief, have been sucked into routine duties. The Intelligence Bureau’s operations hub in New Delhi has just 30-odd executive staff.
Intelligence Bureau chief Asif Ibrahim has cut the shortfall to some 7,000 people-taking in as many as the service’s overstretched training facility can handle. It’s proved just too little though and not because of lack of trying. In 2009, Chidambaram authorised the hiring of 6,000 personnel. However, the IB’s existing training facilities can process just 600 to 700 staff in a year, which barely continued…

Man who eloped with minor girl found dead  saycopsBy: Express News Service | Jalamdhar |

A 25-year-old man was found dead two days after he eloped and reportedly married a minor girl. The deceased has been identified as Jaswinder Singh.
Jaswinder’s family suspects he was killed by the girl’s family, who reportedly objected to the relationship. According to the police, Jaswinder eloped with the girl two days ago, following which a case of kidnapping was registered.
The marriage was also conducted against the wishes of the girl’s family.
Jaswinder returned home with the girl on Saturday, but his mother sent her to her parents’ home. Police said there were no injury marks on the body.

Make or break forSajadWritten by Muzamil Jaleel | Srinagar |

Twelve years after the assassination of his father Abdul Gani Lone, Sajad Lone finds his tumultuous political journey at a crossroads. Defeat could mean the end and, even if he wins, the road ahead will be full of bumps.
Sajad’s candidates across Kupwara face tough contests, but the biggest fight is his own. In his father’s Handwara, Sajad is in a triangular contest against sitting National Conference MLA Choudhary Ramzan — against whom his father had fought bitterly — and PDP’s Ghulam Mohideen Sofi, Sajad’s own creation, a shopkeeper whom he had made his proxy in 2002 and who defeated Ramzan. “I am not contesting against Sajad; he is contesting against me. It is his first (assembly) election; I am contesting my third,” Sofi says.
A fourth contestant, Ajaz Ahmad Sofi, belongs to Awami Ittihad Party of Engineer Rashid who, too, graduated from the late Lone’s political nursery. “If Sajad wants to become CM, why did he field a dummy candidate in 2002 rather than contest himself? Forty thousand lives would have been saved,” Ajaz says. Sajad’s aspirations to the CM’s chair have been a highlight of his campaign.
At any other time, no one would have bet on Lone’s son losing in what was the father’s bastion. Lone hailed from a remote village but his party, the People’s Conference, had its centre in Handwara. His story was a classic political thriller: a poor village boy fights hardship to become a lawyer, join politics and set up a vibrant party that takes on the might of Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah. Lone’s party was a key constituent of a loose alliance to counter the NC-Congress alliance that came up along with the Muslim United Front, a conglomerate of political and religious groups. PC had fought the elections separately but were joined in a common cause against the rivals turned friends NC and Congress.
He went into separatist politics after a poll debacle in 1987. Lone lost his seat to Ramzan by 10 votes in 1983; in 1987, amid allegations of rigging, he lost to Ramzan by 430 votes. Along with Lone, several of his MUF friends joined the separatist movement; his party’s support base was primarily restive young men who, too, would join the movement.
Although Lone was once close to the JKLF , it was Al Barq, an outfit born in mountainous north Kashmir, especially Kupwara, that came to be seen as an armed wing of his party.
Lone was killed in 2002. This was when Sajad came into the limelight, with an outburst against Pakistan and his father’s colleagues in the separatist camp. He fielded proxy candidates in the assembly elections held months later, leading to a split in Hurriyat Conference. While Syed Ali continued…

Black Friday Weekend Shopping Down  But Season Sales May Still Soarblack friday weekend shopping down  but season sales may still soar
Sunni group invites Joshi to inauguratemadrasaWritten by Lalmani Verma | Lucknow |
Posted: December 1, 2014 3:48 am
Veteran BJP leader and Kanpur MP Murli Manohar Joshi, who was associated with the Ram Janmnabhoomi movement, has received an unexpected invitation from a Sunni group to inaugurate an upgraded madrasa in Kanpur and address its students.
According to local BJP leaders, Joshi has accepted the invitation and he would inaugurate the institution during his next visit to the city. Al Jamiat-Ul-Nooria madrasa is located at Noori Road locality, where 60 per cent of the population is Muslim, mostly Sunnis.
According to the madrasa authorities, they were giving an opportunity to the senior BJP leader to speak before Muslims and also list the Union government’s plans for welfare of minorities.
After Joshi received the invitation, BJP’s Kanpur Mahanagar president Surendra Maithani, Cantonment MLA Raghunandan Bhadauriya and Mayor Jagatveer Singh Drona recently inspected the madrasa campus.
“This was a surprise invitation. For the first time in my political career, Muslims have requested a BJP leader to inaugurate a madarsa. Joshiji has accepted the invitation, and hence we had inspected the madrasa a few days back. Some furnishing work was going on there. Now, the madrasa is complete and it will be inaugurated whenever Joshiji visits Kanpur,” Maithani said.
The madrasa is run by a 10-member committee and all the members are from the Sunni sect. The BJP gets support of Shias in UP elections, but not from Sunnis .
Maqsood Ahmed, a faculty at the madrasa’s, noted the institution was running for around 15 years, but so far it was offering courses of Fauquania and Tahtania (up to Class VIII). Now, the madrasa has been upgraded to Class X (Munshi and Maulvi). The building has also been renovated.
“We want to get this upgraded madrasa inaugurated by local MP Murli Manohar Joshiji because he and other BJP leaders often speak from dais that the BJP want development for all and without partiality to any particular community. We want him to speak what the BJP government could do for Muslims,” Maqsood said.
Maqsood also said that application forms for admission to Class IX were being received, but classes would start only after inauguration by Joshi.
When asked about Joshi’s role in the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, Maqsood said, “What ever has happened, that is past now. We need to forget that and move forward to make the society progressive.”
He also praised the Narendra Modi government and said that the economic condition of the country was improving in the NDA regime.
“When public has given mandate to the BJP, Muslims should also give an opportunity to new government to work for all sections of society,” he said.

Twenty-six. It’s a number that has for long held a reverential place in the Australian sporting summer. One that is associated with every cricket tour made to this part of the world. One that translates into the Boxing Day Test, that ultimate showpiece of the inscrutable Australian machismo in sports. The day when a nation collectively goes, “Aussie you beewty..”
On Sunday, 26 had become the national mourning number for Australia . It was a day Phillip Hughes would have turned 26, and have in all likelihood be preparing for a Test comeback at the Gabba. But instead he is in a casket, with his funeral scheduled to be held at his hometown of Macksville, where he grew up picking bananas with his father, on Wednesday.
Australia is a vast stretch of land. It takes you four-and-a-half hours after the GPS on the airplane has told you that you’re flying over Australian soil to reach Sydney. And from the skies, you can see clouds casting wide shadows on the vast expanse. At ground level, you realise it is a nation engulfed by the darkest cloud it’s ever seen, and besieged in a pall of gloom. It’s like every household in Australia is mourning the loss of a dear one —a loving son, a doting baby brother, a beloved cricketer.
And as it tries to overcome the huge hole that Hughes has left in their lives, Australia has become obsessed with any number that it can acquaint with the many memories that the young left-hander from New South Wales has left behind. Traditionally, kids playing grade cricket across the country would be asked to retire when they reached 30. On Sunday, they walked off four runs earlier in a mark of respect to a young man who was refused the right to go past 25 in life.
26 though was only one of many numbers.
A golfing tribute 
On Sunday evening, an American fired a 63 at the Australian golf club in Sydney to win the Australian Open. And the crowd went nuts. The cheering didn’t stop even as young Jordan Speith picked up the ball he had just putted and flashed his club around. It wasn’t just his comprehensive win over the likes of Rory McIlroy that had got the fans going. It was more the score he had finished with. And for a major part of the day, the highlight of the final day’s play was the cricket bat that was placed near the 63rd hole with a golf ball placed reverentially on top. Over the weekend, all A-League matches have been stopped at the 63rd minute with the crowd roaring at the top of their voices to celebrate Hughes’ life continued…

Rape cases: FIRs on rise but conviction rateslidesWritten by Japjeet Duggal | Chandigarh |
Posted: December 1, 2014 3:45 am
While the number of FIRs registered in rape cases in Chandigarh is rising, the rate of conviction has declined in recent years. Police attribute this to the spreading awareness among rape victims and their readiness to take the help of law and register a case. Since 2012, the number of cases registered under Section 376 of IPC has doubled. The precise numbers are 27 in 2012, 45 in 2013 and 54 until October 31 in the current year.
On the other hand, the rate of conviction has decreased drastically from 37.5 per cent in 2013 to 14.28 per cent in 2014. This has happened in spite of the setting up of special courts to facilitate expeditious trial and amendments in law to make them women-friendly.
Chandigarh SSP Sukhchain Singh Gill said that most cases fall flat as the witness turns hostile in the court. “On perusal of many judgments, we found that the victims had turned hostile. We try to keep in touch with the complainants until they are examined, but the statements are recorded in camera and what can we do if they turn hostile?” said the SSP.
Advocate Rabindra Pandit, a criminal lawyer, said, “Since the criminal law was amended widening the denfinition of rape, the number of case has been rising. It has also become an easy tool to malign reputations. Many cases coming these days are fake and the accused pays a hefty sum to the complainant to get acquitted.’”
Recently, a local court acquitted five constables of the Chandigarh police on charges of gangrape after the minor girl, who had lodged the complaint, retracted from her allegations. The constables, who were dismissed from service, have not yet been reinstated.
Earlier, Dr Lalit Vermani, a former District Health Officer of Panchkula, was acquitted when the woman who had accused him of rape turned hostile during the hearing. The woman had approached the police on her own and alleged that the doctor had taken her to a hotel on the pretext of arranging a job, drugged her and then raped her.
Interestingly, neither the dismissed constables nor Dr Vermani has sued the complainats for causing them so much suffering and defamation by lodging a false case. Nor has the court ordered prosecution of the complainants on the charge of perjury for going back on their statements.

UP to have countrys first highway patrolforceBy: Press Trust of India | New Delhi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 3:43 am
Uttar Pradesh government is going to introduce the country’s first highway patrol on NH-2 and NH-25 for which the personnel will be trained by New Zealand Police and the uniform will be designed by fashion designers.
With financial aid to the tune of Rs 250-crore from World Bank, a separate unit – Uttar Pradesh Highway Patrol (UPHP) – will be raised whose jurisdiction will be limited to the highways it patrols.
The unit, which will receive separate branding, will not investigate cases and its role will be limited to ensuring proactive enforcement of traffic laws and quick response to accidents.
“We would soon be implementing it on a stretch of 750 km on NH-2, which enters UP from western part of Mathura and exits near Ballia passing through 13 districts. We are going to build a command centre at every 40 km. Four to five cars and two to three bikes will patrol each 40-km stretch round-the-clock in three shifts of eight hours each,” UP ADG (Traffic) Anil Agrawal said.
The command centres will not be like police stations and will only work as coordination centres between the patrolling parties. These centres will be connected to one central command room.
Around 200 especially designed cars and 150 bikes of 350cc engine will be procured for the force. These vehicles will be installed with GPS and other modern communication devices. The cars will have an ambulance-like space for transporting injured persons in case of an accident and will also contain life-saving equipment.
The ADG said all the work of the unit will be paperless. “Our men will have hand-held devices for issuing challan. Around 500 to 600 personnel will be absorbed on deputation for the unit for a period of three years following which they will have to compulsorily go back. We will send a bunch of officers for training to New Zealand, which would then formulate a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the unit,” said Agrawal.
According to Rajesh Rohtagi, an official with World Bank, UPHP is a component of a larger project named Uttar Pradesh Core Road Network Development Project, which would cost around Rs 3,500 crore. Seventy per cent of the finances for the project are being provided in the form of a loan returnable in 15-20 years.
“We are going to pump in Rs 250 crore for UPHP over the next six years, which will be used for infrastructure, capacity building and equipment. There will be a complete branding exercise to project the unit’s image, including on social and traditional media. They will be very different from the regular police and, for this, we are getting their uniform designed by professional designers,” Rohtagi said.
The exterior of the vehicles too will have a unique design. There will be two personnel in each car and all the members of the force will be given compulsory driving training.
The project will be initially implemented on NH-2 and NH-25 and can be applied to other routes in the future, he said.

We will no longer look east  but act east:ModiBy: Express News Service | Imphal |
Posted: December 1, 2014 3:41 am
Deserted roads greeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he arrived in Imphal Sunday to attend the closing ceremony of Sangai festival, a week-long Manipur tourism event. A call of bandh by Maoists and CorCom—an umbrella organisation of insurgent groups—to protest against the PM visit compelled most people to stay indoors.
However, Bhagyachandra Open Air theatre, the venue for the festival, was packed with people eager to catch a glimpse of the Prime Minister.
Speaking on the occasion, Modi said: “For the first time in 30 years, the people of the country have voted in a stable government. We will use this mandate to ensure that development is put on a fast track. And Manipur will be a part of this. We are no longer going to Look East but Act East — and Manipur will be a gateway for that. The development of the region is extremely significant for the economic development of the country.” He added that the government has allocated Rs 60,000 crore for infrastructure projects to boost connectivity in the region.
Taking a dig at Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh, who raised a host of demands with the PM in his speech, Modi said the Manipur government seemed to have more faith in the BJP government at the Centre than they had on their UPA predecessors.
Earlier, the Manipur CM seized the occasion to raise the Indo-Naga issue with the Prime Minister, who has said the conflict needs to resolved within a timeline. Ibobi said while attempts to end insurgency in the Northeast were welcome, Manipur’s territorial integrity should not be sacrificed “at any cost”.
“Please consider the sentiment in Manipur while trying to resolve the Indo-Naga issue. Not an inch of Manipur’s lands can be sacrificed. We do not want even an inch from any neighbouring state,’’ said Ibobi.
The CM also asked Modi to consider the upgrading of Regional Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) in Imphal to an AIIMS so that the shortage of speciality doctors in the Northeast can be overcome. He also thanked the government for setting up a Sports University in Manipur.
Ibobi also said that Border Roads Organisation had failed to improve connectivity in the Northeast in the past 40 years and stressed the need to upgrade the Imphal-Silchar highway.

BJP president Amit Shah on Sunday stopped midway in his speech while addressing a rally here as the muezzin’s call for prayers was sounded from a mosque close by and said he didn’t want to give West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee an excuse against him.
“Let me stop for a while. Let it (the muezzin’s call for azan) be completed. We don’t want to give Mamata Banerjee an excuse against us,” Shah said midway of his 30-minute speech as the azan (prayers) started. When some BJP supporters started shouting slogans while the azan was going on, the party president raised his hands and asked them to remain silent, reiterating, “We should not give any excuse to Mamata didi.”

Young and educated  but still children of theirfathersWritten by Deepu Sebastian Edmond | Jamshedpur |

The fight for Baharagora and Ghatsila constituencies, both in East Singhbhum, might tempt one to believe that a change is coming to Jharkhand’s politics. At the same time, however, both show how much remains the same.
Photographs of Ghatsila’s Congress candidate Cinderella Balmuchu, just 26, in a lab coat and holding a stethoscope on her campaign material is a source of wonder in Jharkhand. The same goes for the JMM’s Kunal Sharangi, 33, in Baharagora, who is an engineer from NIT Jamshedpur and has done a certificate course from Harvard’s Kennedy School.
Both are, however, products of privilege, the children of former legislators fighting proxy battles. The difference is that both fathers, educated themselves, have ensured their wards have completed their education before asking them to take the political plunge. Sharangi is the son of two-time Baharagora legislator and former BJP leader Dinesh Sharangi. The elder Sharangi, a doctor, was once the state’s health minister.
Of the two, Cinderella Balmuchu’s candidature was the more controversial. When the JMM-Congress alliance broke down on October 31 over seat shares, the JMM blamed Cinderella’s father Pradeep Balmuchu’s personal agenda as one of the main reasons. The Rajya Sabha member and former Pradesh Congress president, who has a PhD, has since managed to get a ticket for Cinderella in Ghatsila, from where he was MLA for three consecutive terms before being defeated by the JMM’s Ramdas Soren in 2009.
This newspaper caught up with Sharangi on Sunday as he entered the last half-hour of campaigning ahead of Tuesday’s election. His campaign had received a major vote of confidence from Chief Minister Hemant Soren, who addressed a public meeting earlier in the day. Almost all reports say Sharangi is in close contest with the BJP’s candidate, its former state unit president Dineshanand Goswami. Goswami is close to former chief minister Arjun Munda; Dinesh Sharangi — who was in talks to return to the BJP — reportedly quit the party over differences with Munda.
Sharangi, whom his supporters address as Kunal, signed out of campaigning by touring villages bordering West Bengal. He is a Brahmin, and so is Goswami. Sharangi believes he is part of a revival movement within the JMM. “Hemant bhaiyya wants young, educated individuals to come into the JMM so that it does not get stereotyped as a party of tribals,” he said. He cited the examples of Vijay Hansdak, lured from the Youth Congress by Hemant to successfully contest the Lok Sabha polls, and Mahua Manjhi, the state women’s commission chairperson who is the JMM’s Ranchi candidate.
Cinderella Balmuchu is reportedly fighting a tougher battle in Ghatsila. Unlike Dinesh Sharangi, who has largely remained in the shadows, Pradeep Balmuchu has guided his daughter throughout. In fact, if one continued…

Three arrested for Sec 17 ISBT robbery  Rs 89 lakhrecoveredBy: Express News Service | Chandigarh |
Posted: December 1, 2014 3:34 am
Almost a month after a goldsmith was robbed of Rs 1.10 crore near the ISBT in Sector 17, the crime branch on Sunday claimed to have solved the case by arresting three men and recovering Rs 89 lakh.
Sikander Rehman alias Denny, Jimmy Bansal and Rahul Bagiyal, all residents of Burail, were arrested near ISBT-17 while attempting to leave the city and relocate to a safer place. Chandigarh SSP Sukhchain Singh Gill said Sikandar, who had been working at the gold hallmarking business of Samir Jain in Sector 23 from the last four years, was the mastermind.
He knew Samir Jain’s routine and that either Jain or his partner often travelled to Delhi for the purchase of gold and carried huge sums of cash, said Gill. His accomplices were Jimmy Bansal, a roadside vendor who sold garments, and Rahul, who worked as a shop hand  in Sector 9.
Late on the night of November 1, Samir Jain was dropped near ISBT-17 by his nephew. He carried Rs 1.10 crore in two bags and was to board a  bus to Delhi. Aware of his plan, the trio had already made their plans.
As Jain was entering the bus stand from the side of the fire station, Jimmy and Rahul hit him from behind on the head with a blunt object. While Jain collapsed, the two fled with the bags, went to Sikandar who waited in a car nearby, and all three escaped.
Sikandar was among the people on whom the police started keeping a watch early on. Soon the police got to know about the other two.
“They had been spending lavishly and had purchased expensive items in the last few weeks. Rahul had spent Rs 10 lakh on his brother’s marriage, while Jimmy was seen donating a large sum of money to a beggar,” said DSP (Crime) Jagbir Singh.

Women in Business Q&A: Jenny Zack  President of LoveSpoon Candlesreddit
Jenny crossed "The Pond" in 1998 to work for the Mouse -- Mickey Mouse, that is -- at Walt Disney World as part of an international program called the Fellowship Program.  Always true to her roots, she represented Wales at the United Kingdom Pavilion at Epcot for a year and a half and then held several influential positions working for the Welsh Development Agency as well as the British Consulate.  Yet what always pulled at her heartstrings was being her own boss and providing a high-quality product that made a difference.  She prides herself in putting her stamp on "high-quality" and also giving back to others in need.  She currently gives some proceeds to a nonprofit organization called Give Kids the World, based in Kissimmee, Florida.  The name LoveSpoon Candles was derived from her homeland of Wales.  In Wales a lovespoon is a decoratively carved wooden spoon that was traditionally presented as a gift of romantic intent.  Jenny loves her homeland of Wales and loves providing high-quality candles for all to savor just as much.
How has your life experience made you the leader you are today?
I was raised in a modest house in Neath, Wales, where my parents worked all hours of the day in the healthcare field.  To this day I never remember wanting for anything, as my parents always provided for me and consistently ensured that my brother and I had the most fruitful life children could possibly have.  I will never forget how my parents led by example through hard work and a positive attitude.  They believed that if you worked hard and helped others along the way as much as you could, all would take care of itself.  I believe in this philosophy.  As a matter of fact, a mantra that I live by comes from the late Zig Ziglar: "No one cares how much you know until they know how much you care."  My husband and I instill this into our two boys, Logan, 10, and Dylan, 6.  We believe in working hard and showing people we care, which is one of the main reasons I launched LoveSpoon Candles.  I want people to see that I put as much thought and care into our product line so that people can cherish each candle as a special gift for themselves or a gift for one of their loved ones.  Nothing makes me happier than when I see that our product allowed someone to kick back and relax.  I have the best job in the world.  I get to create a product that brings joy to so many people.
How has your previous employment experience aided your tenure at the helm of LoveSpoon Candles?
First, I would say working for Disney for several years certainly allowed me to learn from the best in the hospitality business when it comes to guest satisfaction.  I established early on in my career a solid foundation of providing the utmost in customer satisfaction from my Disney training.  Additionally, while working at the Welsh Development Agency and the British Consulate, I was able to see firsthand how companies from my homeland worked on marketing, promotions, sales and business development.  I would say that when I look back now, I guess I have been able to take the customer service training from Disney and blend it with my business training from the British Consulate and Welsh Development Agency to create the boundaries for our company LoveSpoon Candles.
What have the highlights and challenges been during your tenure at LoveSpoon Candles?
The highlight is how much success we have seen in just over a year, and that people are absolutely adoring a product that I make personally is such a great satisfaction.  The challenge is simply having your own business.  Each day is a challenge, yet I strive to offer a high-quality product each and every day.
What advice can you offer to women who want to start their own business?
The advice I would offer to other women is that if you want to start your own business, then simply do it!  There will never be that perfect day, time, or season of the year to do so.  There will always be the excuse of "I will start tomorrow" or "I just don't have the time."  Life is meant to be lived out loud, so get out there and do it.  As Dr. Wayne Dyer says, "Don't die with your music still in you."  My goal in life is to play my music as elegantly and as loud as I can, and when all is said and done, I can only hope that people appreciated the concert.
What is the most important lesson you've learned in your career to date?
The most important thing I have learned is to of course surround yourself with a strong, positive group of people, and secondly to never, ever cut corners.  We at LoveSpoon Candles pride ourselves on providing the utmost in quality, which is the reason why I carefully and methodically hand-pour each of our candles.  The longevity of a company is based on providing high-quality products on a day-in-and-day-out basis, because, let's face it, people work hard, and they want a product that they can appreciate.
How do you maintain a work/life balance?
Life is what you make it.  For me, my work is part of my life, but my family will always come first. That is one of the great things about being your own boss: You get to choose the hours, and I get to do so much with my husband and two boys.  In our family life we juggle between our boys playing baseball, football and acting.  Oh, yeah, and did I mention we have two golden retrievers that we love taking on long brisk walks?  It is an invigorating life I lead, and I pinch myself every day!  I am truly blessed to be able to provide a product that people can enjoy and, at the same time, represent my Welsh heritage and enjoy my family.
What do you think is the biggest issue for women in the workplace?
For me it was having the confidence to speak my mind in board meetings.  Yet as I started getting more and more knowledgeable in my profession, I said to myself, "Enough is enough!"  I decided to start voicing my opinion and taking on more of a leadership role.  I felt I had a lot to offer to the companies that I previously worked for, and I believe to this day they would say that I provided solid contributions.  So I guess I would say the biggest issue is for women being respected for the strong individuals that they are, and frankly this can only be done by having the courage to shine your bright light in your office, boardroom or any other workplace environment.
How has mentorship made a difference in your professional and personal life?
I have been so blessed throughout my life to have so many tremendous mentors spend time with me and guide me over the years.  I could not be in a position that I am in now if it were not for the mentors that assisted me along the way.  I would encourage everyone to find someone that you work with or socialize with that embodies key attributes that you want to possess someday.  Take them out to dinner, and offer to pay for them.  Yet be sure to ask them questions on their achievements.  If you want to be successful, you must spend time with successful people.
Which other female leaders do you admire and why?
Princess Diana.  She was Princess of Wales and did so much good in helping others throughout the world, which inspires me to be able to help others in a similar fashion.
What do you want LoveSpoon Candles to accomplish in the next year?
Expand more domestically.  We have only been in business for a little over a year, and I really want more and more people to be able to "Indulge Their Senses" with our LoveSpoon candles, whether that is with our Cornerstone Collection or our Monogram Series.  I hope to fulfill that goal in 2015.

Out of my mind: Bombay dreamsWritten by Meghnad Desai |
Posted: November 30, 2014 12:30 am
Murli Deora’s passing away is a sad event. He was a political operator par excellence but also a very kind person as I can attest. He was one of those Congress leaders who knew his territory thanks to his deep roots and his ability to get along with every community in Bombay. But coming so soon after the defeat of the Congress in the general elections and then in Maharashtra, it also marks a watershed in the party’s fortunes nationally and in Bombay.
Bombay has become Mumbai over the last 25 years. This is not just a change of name but a change of politics and culture. There was a time when it was Bombay, the southern half of the islands which commanded the state and its capital. The Congress regarded Bombay as one of its strongholds. It had a Provincial Congress Committee of its own. Bombay was the place where the Quit India call was given and where the Gandhi-Jinnah talks took place in 1944.
The Congress drew strength from its connections with the money and the intellectuals of Bombay. K F Nariman is no longer known as anything more than a tourist point but he led the Congress before World War II. As a Parsi, he represented the best of Bombay’s cosmopolitan culture. Bhulabhai Desai, a distinguished barrister, was another pillar of Bombay Congress. The combination of Parsis, lawyers, businessmen and intellectuals (some belonging to more than one category) was at the heart of Congress power in Bombay.
It was mainly Gujarati and Parsi, but with S K Patil, Bombay had a shrewd operator who could extend the influence of the Congress into the Marathi-speaking community while keeping his business contacts flourishing. Patil also extended his friendship to the film industry (not yet called Bollywood) which lay to the north of the Mahim creek in Juhu/Bandra with studios in Chembur and Andheri. When Nehru wanted to induct V K Krishna Menon into the Lok Sabha, it was the film stars who campaigned for him in his North Bombay constituency.
Even so, the Congress began to lose Bombay when Panditji could not see the force of the demand for Samyukta Maharashtra. The Congress lost heavily in the 1957 Assembly elections and from then on had to abandon the cosmopolitan face of its leadership and put forward Marathi-speaking leaders. Morarji Desai was kicked upstairs to Central Cabinet. The Congress was lucky in having Y B Chavan who was an intellectual in politics and then many more leaders, with Sharad Pawar the latest in a long line. But the Congress had no mass leader in Bombay itself. The strength of its chief ministers lay in the rural hinterlands of Maharashtra, with Bombay being just a cash cow. With Bal Thackeray mobilising Marathi support from mid Bombay and further north, South Bombay lost its influence. The centre of gravity of politics moved from the Fort to Parel and Lalbaug and then further north.
Murli Deora was the  last link with the Congress past of powerful middlemen in South Bombay. They kept the money flowing smoothly.
Deora did not crave for the top position. He had clout and did not need high status to prove it. He was a quintessential Bombaywallah as his linguistic identity did not impede his popularity. He spoke Bombay’s language which is many languages put together in a mixie to bring out a heady blend called Bambaiya.
The Shiv Sena established its control over Mumbai by ignoring, if not neglecting, South Bombay. Indeed it behaved as an anti-Bombay party even when it ruled Maharashtra. When 26/11 happened, it was in South Bombay, which was alien territory to the then home minister of Maharashtra. ATS chief Hemant Karkare died the day Saamna, the Sena newspaper, had denounced him. Bombay felt abandoned by the Congress both locally and nationally.
Bombay’s dream of being Shanghai did not get any attention from the UPA or the Maharashtra Congress-NCP coalition. It is too much to hope that the new government in Maharashtra will care about reviving the business and financial centre that South Bombay used to be.
The contrasting fortunes of Delhi and Bombay show how much Bombay is a step child of the Congress. Will the BJP do any better?

From the discomfort zone: What will people sayWritten by Shombit Sengupta |
Posted: November 30, 2014 12:49 am
Our society’s most killing missile that prevents us from taking ownership of our lives is to wonder at every step what others will say. Nandita, a highly educated, 24-year-old working woman, was telling me that her parents will not object to her possible love marriage. Yet they and close family members have overdosed her to be very conscious about whom to choose, otherwise “What will people say?”. Her core investigation of boys and the big dilemma that comes to her mind when she feels romantically inclined is, “What will others say?”. She was expressing that, by nature, she will not go against her parents in choosing a boyfriend, which amounts to following a pre-determined pattern of who should be her ideal husband.
In India’s contemporary situation, she explained in a matter-of-fact way, having an affair need not translate to marriage, an area that’s not under her control.
Somehow she was realising her inner emotional content is getting disturbed. She said she has time up to age 27, but her conversation became indifferent, “With all my restrictions, I may fail in a love marriage, so I have to depend on my parents to find me a bridegroom”.
While I was doing some research in an Indian village, a farmer’s son told me their two-acre land gave them Rs 50,000, while Rs 20,000 was spent on input costs. With Rs 30,000 a year it was impossible to run their seven-member family. On his own initiative, he bought a small motorbike and became a mobile barber, going to people’s houses to earn money. This brought him nearly Rs 15,000 per month. But his relatives wanted to disassociate with him. Why? Because they are Brahmins and he was “defiling” the family’s image by pursuing a lower-caste job.
I really appreciate this courageous spirit of today’s young generation not caring about what people say. After the research, I went to his house and found the family living conditions quite comfortable with the money he brought in. He showed me his barber kit. His parents were despondent, wondering how they would get a Brahmin girl for him because his entrepreneurship was not acceptable in their community.
My own barrier was not so different. When Mr Jacques Gourdon, owner of the lithography printshop near Paris, very kindly offered me a sweeping job in 1974, I was totally shocked. It was unimaginable. I was from a Bengali bodhiya family. We were extremely poor in India, lived in a refugee colony. But how could I be a sweeper? I’d just arrived in France, knew no French, was penniless and without any job prospect. My growling stomach quickly won over my cultural blocks. I de-conditioned my continued…

Flip side: Year of the superheroWritten by Dilip Bobb |
Posted: November 30, 2014 12:41 am
Is it a bird? Is it a plane? Is it a drone? No, it’s SuperNamo, (with apologies to Superman). India’s new muscularity on the global and domestic stage has created a host of supermen and women, giving Marvel Comics an inferiority complex. It’s a complex development and all to do with power and an increasingly aggressive posture. Here are today’s leading superheroes.
DyNAMO: or Supernamo as he was known in an earlier avatar. He’s faster than a speeding bullet, one day in Sydney, next seen in Kashmir, Kathmandu, then back to Jammu, seemingly able to leap over the Himalayas in a single bound. Some call it Modiflying as he circles the world to reassure everyone that the force is with them. He uses his amazing powers in a never-ending battle to save the planet from destruction, and SAARC from the evil designs of the fire-breathing dragon called China. As we saw in Kathmandu, just one handshake can send everyone in retreat and save a regional grouping from collapse. Even the head of the sole superpower dare not decline his invitation. His 56-inch chest and limitless energy elicits shock and awe among his opponents, which makes one wonder why his wife needs to plead for protection from her protectors.
Muffler Man: He prefers a cap to a cape, and now that winter’s here, the Muffler Man is sure to re-appear, along with the broom to sweep the city clean and ensure a return to his glory days. The loss of his powers was self-inflicted but instead of resigning himself to his fate, he is back with us, asking to restore his superpowers, cutting electricity wires without a care, lifting water tankers one-handed, taking on the high and mighty, driving his supercar, the mighty WagonR, through the world’s most dangerous streets, fuelled on people power, the aam aadmi. Now, Arvind Kejriwal, a.k.a Muffler Man, looks to take his Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) to victory in the Three Cornered Battle, but pehle aap may no longer be the case.
Betman: He’s as tough as the cement he makes, destroys his opponents (or sends them into exile) with studied nonchalance, rules over the world of cricket and the Chennai Super Kings with an iron hand, and believes in strong family values. It’s because of family values that he’s now being called Betman, for presiding over an IPL that is now under review by the third umpire, in this case, the Supreme Court. In cricket administrative terms, Betman, also known as Cement Man, N Srinivasan, could now be made an outlaw because of an in-law.
Wonder Woman: People often wonder how she became so all-powerful, and a minister, and so highly educated, but Smriti Irani has become the caped crusader, determined to restore the country’s glory as a mighty kingdom. The fact that she played Sita in a Ramayana serial may have given her inspiration, with help from random astrologers. It could also explain her love for Sanskrit. Sita was a paragon of feminine virtues for all Hindu women, known for her “self-sacrifice” and “courage” — and walking through fire  —  and, despite the opposition she often faces, the cabinet’s Wonder Woman takes it all in her stride, in keeping with the Bollywood movie she is acting in, titled All is Well.
Invisible Woman: You see her here you see her there, er.., not quite. Sushma Swaraj seems to have lost some of her stature of late, resulting in her being overshadowed by those around her and above her. In a cabinet of macho, high-profile Alpha Males, her invisible act tends to go…, well, unnoticed.

Fifth column: Hope and audacityWritten by Tavleen Singh |

At the end of six months of the Modi sarkar are we seeing signs that it is confusing efficiency with reform? I ask the question because so far there is no sign of real reform in any area of governance. And, because some of Narendra Modi’s most ardent supporters are now beginning to get worried. Last week I met a man who dedicated a whole year to helping Modi become Prime Minister and he seemed despondent. When I asked how he thought the government was doing, he said he would answer in the words of the management guru Peter Drucker, “There is nothing quite so useless as doing with great efficiency something that should not be done at all.”
We can certainly not fault this government on efficiency. Ministers, high officials, clerks and peons now report for duty on time and are no longer to be seen taking long lunch breaks to soak in winter sunshine in Delhi’s parks. The Prime Minister’s Office hums with more noise and activity than we have seen in a decade but, despite this, there are no signs of the policy changes that are vital if we are to see real reform. The Planning Commission has been abolished but there are many, many other leftovers from socialist times that must go. Do we need a Ministry of Information & Broadcasting in an age when the Internet has made propaganda futile? Do we need a meddlesome University Grants Commission? Do we need the government to continue wasting our money on a hopeless airline and badly run hotels? We do not.
What we do need is for the government to make policies that will convince investors that India is a safe bet once more. We do not need a new government that simply implements more efficiently bad policies that it inherited from the last government. It was because of those policies that investors fled and the economy stopped growing. Unless this changes through better policies, the jobs that the Prime Minister promises young people at election rallies will not come. So far signals are so mixed that investors continue to shy away.
The Finance Minister promises to end tax terrorism but in the next breath orders tax inspectors to go forth in search of black money. Vodafone has been given temporary relief by the courts but the retroactive tax remains valid. And, although we hear that the government has grandiose plans to improve the decrepit transport systems, power stations and ports it inherited, it continues to refuse to pay those who have to build them. The infrastructure industry is owed more than Rs 1.5 lakh continued…

Immigration enriches you and meBy: New York Times |
Posted: November 30, 2014 12:36 am
A book, The Christian Examiner, warns that “ill-clad and destitute” immigrants are “repulsive to our habits and our tastes”. A former mayor of New York City cautions  they bring disease, “wretchedness and want” to America. And Harper’s Weekly despairs that immigrants are “steeped in ignorance” and account for a disproportionate share of criminals.
Boy, those foreigners were threatening — back in the mid-1800s when those statements were made about Irish immigrants.
Once again, the United States is split by vitriolic debates about how to handle immigrants, following President Barack Obama’s executive action to shield millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation. To me, the outrage seems driven by three myths:
Immigrants threaten our way of life: Many Americans see foreigners moving into their towns, see signs in Spanish, and fret about changes to the traditional fabric of society.
That’s an echo of the anxiety Theodore Roosevelt felt in 1918 when, referring to German and other non-Anglo European immigrants, he declared, “Every immigrant who comes here should be required within five years to learn English or leave the country.” That’s an echo of the “yellow peril” scares about Chinese and Japanese immigrants.
Undocumented immigrants may lower wages in some sectors, harming low-skilled native-born Americans who compete with them. One study suggests that a 10 per cent increase in the size of a skill group lowers the wages of blacks in that group by 2.5 per cent.
Yet, immigration has hugely enriched the country. For starters, unless you are a full-blooded American Indian, we have you.
Nations, like carpets, benefit from multiple kinds of threads, and Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, was right: “It is a good rule of thumb to ask of a country: Are people trying to get into it or out of it?”.
Immigrants are different because they’re illegals: People aren’t legal or illegal, behaviours are. If an investment banker is convicted of insider trading, he doesn’t become an illegal. So let’s refer not to “illegal immigrants” but to “undocumented immigrants”.
They have contributed $100 billion to Social Security over a decade without any intention of collecting benefits, thus shoring up the system, according to Stephen C Goss, chief actuary for the Social Security Administration.
At the state and local level, households headed by unauthorised immigrants paid another $11 billion in taxes in 2010 alone.
If migrants are given work permits and brought into the system, they will contribute $45 billion over five years in payroll taxes to the US economy, according to the Center for American Progress.
Immigration reform is an unconstitutional power grab by a dictator: Senator Ted Cruz compared President Obama’s executive action to the Catiline conspirators seeking to overthrow the Roman Republic. House Speaker John Boehner suggested that it was continued…

IS not fighting a holy war: Areeb Majeed tells NIA | Jihadists suffer heavy losses in SyriaAreeb Majeed
(Areeb Majeed also revealed…)
MUMBAI: Areeb Majeed , suspected member of terror outfit Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), has revealed the names of the local contacts, who allegedly provided him the logistics to join the group to take part in the battle in Iraq, NIA officials said today.
Majeed also disclosed how he was completely sidelined by the terror group as he had been asked to carry out menial tasks like cleaning toilets or providing water to those on the battlefield, instead of being pushed into the warzone.
"Majeed was today grilled for several hours when he revealed the names of the local contacts, who radicalized him and his three other friends here, and helped them fly to Iraq. We are verifying his claims and are trying to locate these local contacts," a National Investigation Agency official said.
However, the officer refused to divulge the names of the local supporters here saying it would derail the probe.
Asked for how many months he participated in the battle on the ground, the 23-year-old ISIS 'recruit' said he was completely ignored and asked to clean the toilets and arrange water for those battling with the security forces.
He told the investigators that despite his immediate supervisor's request, the ISIS cadres did not allow him to participate in the battle.
His resolve to take part in the war weakened after he was left unattended for his bullet injury for three days before being taken to a hospital, he told them.
"Only after I begged them, I was taken to a hospital. I was treating myself, but the injury was worsening as there was no proper medication or food available in the camps," Majeed told investigators.
"There was neither a holy war nor any of the preachings in the holy book were followed. ISIS fighters raped many a woman there," Majeed said while responding to one of the questions, an NIA official said.
Admitting that he and his three friends from Kalyan underwent training on handling of sophisticated AK 47 and rocket launchers, Majeed claimed the Indians were considered to be physically weak.
Majeed was arrested on Friday on his return to Mumbai after spending nearly six months in Iraq. He was booked under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) on charges of conspiring to commit a terrorist act and being a member of a banned foreign terror outfit, and under the stringent Section 125 of the IPC for "waging war against the nation".

KOLKATA: JSW Steel Ltd, the third largest Indian Steel maker, today said it has deferred the proposed acquisition of Italy's Lucchini SpV .
"For the time being, plans for India is much stronger and larger. We want to focus in India.... We have deferred our decision to invest in the Italian project," JSW Steel chairman and managing director Sajjan Jindal said.
He was speaking on the sidelines of inauguration of Ispat Pragati Bhawan, the new office of Institute of Steel Development & Growth (Insdag) in the city.
In September, Jindal had told reporters that JSW has offered less than USD 100 million for three mills of the insolvent Lucchini and it was in a position to win it.
The company recently also gave a clarification in the bourses saying, "In line with our long term strategy to acquire finishing mills near to the market, we have submitted a binding bid for takeover of Rolling Mills of the Piombini Plant of Lucchini in Italy subject to certain terms and conditions. We are yet to get the response on this bid."
Lucchini, with a steel capacity of about 2.5 mt, was owned by Russia's Severstal but had to be declared insolvent in 2012 following which the government placed it under special administration and started the process to find buyers.
JSW currently has a total installed steel making capacity of 14.3 million tonnes in India.

Hi-tech copying racket for Railways exam busted in Hyderabad  30heldWritten by Sreenivas Janyala | Hyderabad |
Posted: December 1, 2014 4:15 am
A gang involved in hi-tech cheating in an all-India Railway Recruitment Board exam was busted in Hyderabad on Sunday. The gang allegedly used earpieces with SIM cards to convey the answers to their candidates at different centres in Hyderabad, Tirupati and some other places in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.
The police arrested 30 people, including candidates, and seized eight electronic devices with in-built SIM cards, two laptops, a printer, nine earpieces resembling bluetooth devices and 27 cellphones.
The main accused has been identified as Mahender Kumar, a Railways employee who has also been arrested. “Kumar lured gullible candidates and collected Rs 5 lakh each from them. He provided electronic devices, and assured them that the answers would be dictated,” said an official.
At 2:30 pm, the police raided a secluded area in Malkajgiri, and nabbed 20 people who were in the process of dictating answers to the candidates in exam halls through electronic devices.
“Kumar received the questions on WhatsApp from the candidates. He sent the questions to his team, who relayed the answers to the candidates. The candidates were wearing earpieces containing SIM cards and were connected via bluetooth,” said the official.

China seeks to fund Indias first rail university  wants say incurriculumWritten by Avishek G Dastidar | New Delhi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 4:11 am
China has proposed to co-fund India’s first Railway university and handhold the Indian Railways as it takes baby steps in making the centre for learning a reality. Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently promised to set up four such universities in the country, and the government is set to start work on the first one.
After a formal visit to three universities in China last month — Beijing Jiaotong University, Tongji University and Southwest Jiaotong University — Railways Ministry officials submitted a report saying that China has offered its cooperation.
China’s National Railway Administration told the Indian delegation that apart from co-funding between Chinese Railway universities and the Indian Railways, they are interested in joint development of curriculum, design of the university campus and facilities, student and teacher exchange programmes, and offering latest learning technologies to India. The course design could also be such that one could pursue a dual academic degree, of which one part could be completed in India and the other part in one of the Chinese universities. “These programmes are to be collaborated at the graduate level, Masters level as well as the doctorate level,” said a senior government official.
As of now, the Railways is struggling with some teething trouble in its quest to set up the first university. EdCIL India, a PSU under the HRD Ministry, has asked for around Rs 60 lakh from the Railways to make a detailed project report, including drafting a bill required for the creation of the university. Taken aback by the steep quote to make just a report, the Railways has put it up for discussion before an internal high-level committee. An inter-ministerial dialogue is also expected on this.
The choice of location for the university, sources said, has been left with Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu, who will take the decision with the help of the Railway Board. The only preference is the presence of an airport nearby so that movement of visiting faculty and others associated with the university does not become a problem.
The Railway university will teach courses on management, finance as well as specialised engineering courses. Although it will be run by the Indian Railways, there will be no job guarantee for graduates, who will have to go through the established competitive processes — a subject that has been discussed internally, sources said.
As of now, IIT Kharagpur has been roped in to start a railway engineering course in collaboration with the Railways. Chinese universities have also evinced interest to participate by way of visiting faculty and other forms of collaboration.
Seeking China’s help on this was a conscious decision because China started specialised railway-related institutes way back in the late 19th Century. Ever since then, big universities in China have rolled out railway-specific technical as well as non-technical courses.

Dear unforeseenvalue, I know you are one of the oldest boarders on this board from lower levels of 30-40/. I am swing your messages for long. The way agrochemicals /other Agro related stocks like seeds etc have performed, like PI, KAVERI, MONSANTO, DHANUKA, Insecticides, etc, Astec is likely to move further ahead to say 140/ level. Going forward these stocks will do better going by the way they have performed this season despite an average monsoon. I think the small caps that are poised to do well in the next one year will include Astec, Aimco pesticides, Paushak. I own the two except Aimco which I am targeting for an entry. Warm regards!

Manufacturing needs a quality boostWill cheap gas last?
A significant innovation of the ‘Make In India’ call by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, given on August 15, was the addition of ‘Zero Defect, Zero Effect’. This translates into a manufacturing mission that is high on quality as also environmentally sustainable. In fact, the two goals are complementary—a nation’s development is sustainable only when the producers of products and services deliver highest levels of quality, at lowest cost, most efficiently, with minimum environmental impact and most responsible use of resources.
‘Quality’ is a holistic concept that goes beyond production of high-class goods and services to encompass entire processes and systems at the firm level and at the national level to maximise outcome, efficiency and productivity at minimal cost. It extends to long-term business strategies for organisational excellence and success and can be extrapolated to include efficient supply chains. Inculcating a culture of quality in the country so as to meet the objectives of Zero Defect, Zero Effect requires a mindset change among the policy-makers and industry alike in order to enhance national competitiveness in the global marketplace and succeed in manufacturing transformation.
India today has a large number of winners and recipients of internationally-acclaimed awards for business excellence. According to CII data, there are 21 awardees of the renowned Deming Prize and 238 Total Productivity Maintenance (TPM) awardees of the Japan Institute of Plant Maintenance (JIPM). Firms have also worked towards obtaining international energy and green ratings, certifications covering quality, energy and environment, and other well-known business excellence standards.
This drive for excellence has enabled gains in productivity, quality, costs, operational efficiencies and conservation of critical natural resources. In training programmes conducted by CII on Quality Management Systems, we have seen production in participating firms going up by 50%, quality levels increasing by 80%, cost of manufacturing coming down by 5-8%, and cost of maintenance being slashed by 30-50%. A huge positive outcome has been zero accidents, zero breakdowns and zero defects in the companies which have gone through the TPM process. The high point is raised morale of employees as staff at all levels is involved in kaizen or continuous improvement and innovation as well as in aligning to enterprise goals. Such quality interventions have helped enhance the image of Indian manufacturing and many of our companies have emerged as top-five producers of their product categories in the world. While this is a no mean achievement, there is still a long way to go for universal coverage in terms of scale and numbers of manufacturing enterprises.
A comprehensive initiative for expanding quality attainments would aim to transform methodologies, processes and systems across the value chain. It would revitalise the use of manufacturing tools and techniques while building a strong brand for India and its products and services, focusing both on the customer as well as on society as a whole. The endeavour of Zero Defect, with a focus on the customer, would act towards zero non-conformance and non-compliance. On the other hand, Zero Waste, Zero Effect, with a societal focus, would focus on zero air pollution, zero liquid discharge, zero solid waste and zero wastage of natural resources. This would converge the Make In India mission with the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and stress minimising waste at the industry level.
Strong and clear standards, identifying specific criteria for compliance towards Zero Defect and Zero Effect, need to be developed across diverse fields. Each criterion would be in the form of graded improvements that would be demonstrable with the highest grade corresponding to world-class maturity assessment criteria, and should include both enablers and results. This would help Indian industry to measure itself against global benchmarks and seek to evolve to its desired levels of quality.
A range of areas need to be addressed to make industry competitive and quality-compliant. The use and adoption of proven and time-tested quality tools and techniques, green technologies, management systems, excellence models, fundamental concepts and innovative approaches, and coordinated and time-bound processes using a defined roadmap with clear outcomes will be some of strategies that Indian industry would need to deploy. Industry would need support in terms of training, consultancy and advisory services that would assist firms in adopting these proven methodologies. Multiple modes including awareness dissemination, personalised interventions, audits, assessments and cluster mode would be required to achieve the twin goals and build necessary internal capacities and capabilities for vibrant and sustainable enterprises.
CII’s Institute of Quality is the initiator of India’s first maturity assessment criteria ever on Zero Defect, Zero Effect, termed as the ZED Maturity Assessment Criteria. Evolved with the collaboration of the Quality Council of India, this would bring out a ZED framework with a maturity matrix to guide industry to commence and advance on quality attainments. Benchmarks would be established across focus sectors and products, which would enable India’s 1.1 million MSMEs to reference themselves. Besides CII Institute of Quality, other CII Centres of Excellence who will be actively participating in this ZED movement would include CII-Avantha Centre for Competitiveness for SMEs, CII-ITC Centre of Excellence for Sustainable Development, CII-Sohrabji Godrej Green Business Centre, CII-Triveni Water Institute, CII-Naoroji Godrej Centre of Excellence and CII Andhra Pradesh Technology Development and Promotion Centre.
The success of the Make In India mission would depend heavily on the competitiveness of Indian enterprises, particularly MSMEs. Zero Defect, Zero Effect should thus be developed as an additional mission in partnership with industry to support and assist companies.

Monetary policy: How much can RBI ease? RBI may preserve headroom to close CPI-WPI divergence in moving towards medium-term, 4% inflation target

Editorial: RBIs inclusion pushIndian rupee slips past psychological $63 mark to hit 13-month low
RBI’s guidelines for small finance banks are less onerous than the draft rules, which is probably why a couple of microfinance institutions (MFIs) and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) are already at work on their spreadsheets. While the prospect of being able to mobilise deposits must be tempting, especially for an MFI because it would bring down the cost of funds dramatically once there is a reasonable-sized base of current and savings accounts, some of the savings will be lost in meeting the cash reserve ratio and the statutory liquidity ratio norms. In the initial years, therefore, the returns will be slightly lower but that’s the cost of being in business.
Indeed, while there are no geographical restrictions on where the bank can set up shop, it’s not going to be easy for a new entity to build a loan portfolio in an unbanked or even under-banked region; an MFI should have less trouble scaling up since it would be more familiar with the territory and customers. They would have no trouble ensuring that three-fourths of the net credit comprises priority sector loans; where large banks have found lending to farmers a risky proposition—SBI has a high level of non-performing assets—and NBFCs too may take time to get a handle on the business, MFIs should find the going relatively easy. Since many MFIs have followed the self-help group model targeting women as borrowers to ensure that repayments are regular, they may stay with that approach.
To that extent, the cap on the ticket size of R25 lakh, for 50% of the loans, might be irrelevant because the average ticket size could end up being much smaller. The guidelines, therefore, seem aimed at helping MFIs to graduate to banks and the central bank should get a good number of applications. The dream of becoming a universal bank at a later stage—a la Bandhan—would egg them on. Indeed, given how banks will be focusing on financial inclusion for the next decade at least, a sound business can fetch the promoter a handsome valuation in an M&A transaction. Indeed, with millions unlikely to get access to formal banking, there’s potential for payments banks as the growing value of transactions through m-wallet, which has more than tripled in the last two years to R2,750 crore, indicates. The majority of these transactions were remittances but by providing customers with more services, telecom operators can reduce the churn, in the process earning additional revenues. That way they would leverage their large distribution networks, including those in rural India, more effectively. However, revenues from the payments bank business are likely to be paltry—CRISIL estimates that even after years the contribution to their total revenues is likely to be less than 1%. Moreover, payments banks are likely to have less than 0.5% of the total CASA. Perhaps some of them will want to team up with a bank to spare themselves the challenge of cash management, though it’s not clear whether banks bring much else to the table.

Data Drive: Global lessons for Indias manufacturingWill cheap gas last?
As India embarks on a massive manufacturing mission that is high on quality and environmentally sustainable, there has to be a paradigm shift in the way the country handles the industry. In the last two decades, India’s share in global manufacturing GDP grew from 0.9% to just 2% and its share of global merchandise exports rose from 0.5% to 1.7%. The sector accounted for 15% of GDP in 1993; it remains about the same even today. Even the number of jobs in the sector remained low over the last two decades, increasing only 1.8% per year from 37 million to 53 million.
When seen against the performance of India’s peers, a lot needs to be done. Between 1993 and 2013, China’s share of global manufacturing GDP leapfrogged from 3.1% to 24.1%, and its share of global merchandising exports rose from 2.4% to 11.5%. At the current pace, it will be difficult for the sector to achieve 25% of GDP target set by the National Manufacturing Policy.
However, if the government’s Make in India initiative boosts investment and fosters innovation and technology development, manufacturing sector can create significant employment—about 60 million additional jobs over the next decade—and raise the sector’s share to 25% of GDP.
Skilling the workforce will be a key requirement as the demand for skilled workers far outweighs the available supply. Due to years of under-investment in employee skilling and training, India has one of the least skilled manpower among the top manufacturing nations. A Boston Consulting Group report says only 17% of those entering the workforce are skilled. And even those who are skilled, quality remains a major issue, as 5% of workers are highly skilled and a staggering 64% are associated with a very low level of skilling.

Black Friday Deals Aren t Always So Specialblack friday deals aren t always so special
From the discomfort Zone: What will others sayWill cheap gas last?
Our society’s most killing missile that prevents us from taking ownership of our lives is to wonder at every step what others will say.
Nandita, a highly educated, 24-year-old working woman, was telling me that her parents will not object to her possible love marriage. Yet they and close family members have overdosed her to be very conscious about whom to choose, otherwise “what will people say?” Her core investigation of boys and the big dilemma that comes to her mind when she feels romantically inclined is, “what will others say?” She was expressing that, by nature, she will not go against her parents in choosing a boyfriend, which amounts to following a pre-determined pattern of who should be her ideal husband. In India’s contemporary situation, she explained in a matter-of-fact way, having an affair need not translate into marriage, an area that’s not under her control. Somehow, she was realising her inner emotional content was getting disturbed. She said she has time up to the age of 27 years, but her conversation became indifferent, “With all my restrictions, I may fail in a love marriage, so I have to depend on my parents to find me a bridegroom.”
While doing some research in an Indian village, a farmer’s son said their two-acre land gives them R50,000, while R20,000 is spent on input costs. So, with R30,000 for the year, it’s impossible to run their seven-member family. Taking his own initiative, he bought a small motorbike and became a mobile barber, going to people’s houses to earn money. This brings him nearly R15,000 per month. But his relatives want to disassociate with him. Why? Because they are Brahmins and he’s defiling the family’s image by pursuing a lower-caste job. I really appreciate this courageous spirit of today’s young generation not caring about what people say. After the research, I went to his house and found the family living condition was quite comfortable with the money he brings in. He showed me his barber kit. His parents were despondent, wondering how they will marry him off to a Brahmin girl because his entrepreneurship is not acceptable in their community.
My own barrier was not so different. When Jacques Gourdon, owner of the lithography printshop near Paris, very kindly offered me a sweeping job in 1974, I was shocked. It was unimaginable. I was from a Bengali bodhiya family. We were extremely poor in India, lived in a refugee colony. But how could I be a sweeper? I’d just arrived in France, knew no French, was penniless and without any job prospect. My growling stomach quickly won over my cultural blocks. I deconditioned my Indian caste-conscious baggage and graciously accepted the job.
But more mental torture awaited me. My job entailed taking six big dustbins full of used ink cleaning cloth and papers out from my printshop to the road at the end of each working day. That traumatised me. “What if someone saw me?” That this instant fear was ridiculous did not occur to me then. Just imagine the kind of complex I was carrying in my head. Nobody knew me in France then, which Indian would see me or even wonder who I was? How can any acquaintance or neighbour from my Indian village ever know I was here that I had to be careful of, “What will they say?” But psychologically, I was very disturbed. Lots of cars and buses ply on the main road, so every time I went outside the door with my dustbins, I used to hide my face not to be recognised as a sweeper in society.
After some time, I discovered this anguish to be totally absurd when I found Gourdon was respectfully presenting me to other artists who came to the printshop as a painter from Calcutta. He’d even promote my paintings, so I could make some extra money. The artists who’d come to the printshop to make their lithographs never looked down at my sweeping work like we tend to do in India. That broke my whole misconception of what other people will think. I started to boldly say then that my occupation was a sweeper while I was a painter. My morale was boosted when fellow students at my Parisian art college appreciated that I worked hard to support my education and livelihood, while undermining themselves that they were studying with their father’s money. So I learnt that worrying about what others will say is the most indecent social education system in our country because it puts you in a cage you cannot break free from.
Just imagine, a cobbler in our country is considered the lowest caste ‘mochi’. I remember, even in my poverty-stricken childhood, my grandmother never allowed me to touch the cobbler when he came to repair a broken sandal. After he left, the place he occupied was cleaned with water. Does it mean our cobbler has no chance of becoming a Christian Louboutin or Jimmy Choo, the celebrated shoe designers whose hand everyone wants to shake?
“Hats off to you! You don’t care what others will say” is what people in India often tell me about the bright, holiday colours I wear to work to meet top global corporate managers. Actually, I started wearing such colours in France to differentiate myself from the high-flying CEOs I had to mingle with, and didn’t really pay heed to this habit. Until I recently met Nandita and discovered the gravity of the words, “What will people say?”
The enveloping torment that society puts on people of a different caste and creed does not allow us to blossom to our full potential. I hope India’s young generation will ignore such persecution of “What will others say?” and make their careers without boundary, achieve their love life without other’s interference and create their livelihood in every domain with dignity.

Monetary policy: How much can RBI ease? RBI may preserve headroom to close CPI-WPI divergence in moving towards medium-term, 4% inflation target

Forget monumental change  where is incremental changeTata Steel close to reopening its top iron ore mine
Why Jyotiraditya Scindia
Part of the Congress’ youth brigade that was seen as the party’s bright new hope, Jyotiraditya Scindia was among its few members to retain his seat in the LS polls. As the Congress’ chief whip, he has to shepherd its small grouping of 44 to make their voice count against the BJP’s brute majority in Lok Sabha. Having held commerce, industry and power portfolios as MoS in the UPA government, he brings to his new job expertise on issues close to the Narendra Modi regime’s agenda, and his oratory.
MANOJ CG: The Congress seems to have learned no lesson from its Lok Sabha defeat. For example, the party announced a 28-member campaign committee only two weeks before the first phase of polling in Jammu & Kashmir. Why such last-minute decisions?
A major learning for us is the fact that you may do a lot of good work but it’s important to communicate that good work too. We require a lot of improvement in communication. A lot of internal manthan is going on within the Congress. I’ve been part of one of those meetings and a lot of churning is going on. I’m quite confident that in the next month or two, you will see a detailed timeline outlining our way forward as a constructive opposition party for the next five years.
COOMI KAPOOR: But isn’t this churning taking too long?
In our meetings, there’s been a lot of plain-speaking and introspection. Let’s wait for the results, which I’m confident will come out in the next one or two months. Surely, there needs to be visibility and a roadmap. Timeline— six or four months—is not the key issue. The key issue is to come out with a robust programme. Somewhere along the way, in addition to the factors I mentioned, we lost the connect with aspirational India. You need to be able to re-establish that connect. That connect has to be re-established not only in terms of the role of the opposition at the Centre but also in terms of the role in various states.
MANEESH CHHIBBER: You’ve talked about visibility. Does this also mean that Rahul Gandhi needs to be more visible?
We’ve learnt it the hard way, in the 2014 elections, that for any political party, communication is key. Being omnipresent across all forms of media— lectronic, digital, social—is important. As a party and as leaders and individuals within it, at the district level, at the state level, at the Centre, right up to the leadership level, we have to be able to engage with and understand the new India.
MANEESH CHHIBBER: You’re a young leader, the aspirational India. You retained your seat. What do you think the Congress could have done right to get more seats?
First, remember, you are on the back of a 10-year government. Secondly, we also had tremendous headwinds—oil at $115 a barrel and now, it’s $80a barrel. Oil prices are down by 30%—that’s a huge fillip to the fiscals. We did a lot of work, but I also post this 20-20 hindsight—good work is not enough, marketing it is important too. The government today is doing a lot of marketing and communicating, but not much has happened in the past six months. Forget the promised monumental change, we’re not even seeing incremental change. You talk about ‘Make in India’, but there’s not much change on the ground.  That party is using communication and branding strategy to the zenith and, on the other hand, the Congress needs to improve a lot on that front.
LIZ MATHEW: Many of you have given suggestions to the leadership publicly and at internal meetings. But there seems to be no reaction from the leadership. For example, in Tamil Nadu, despite the Congress being out of power for many years, it still has 5-6% vote. Even when you were in power, the party failed to expand that base. Do you think there needs to be a change from the top, a leadership change, if only on a trial basis?
Let’s not forget that this is the same Congress that came to power in 2004 and 2009. So, a number of things have worked for us. After 10 years, you have anti-incumbency. I am not making an excuse. Obviously, we failed. Top-down, bottom-up, we all recognise it. The key challenge here is to carve a path forward. It’s important to identify leadership and we’ve done that in a couple of states, like in Rajasthan with Sachin (Pilot). I believe that’s the path forward because unless you have strong states, you will not have a strong Centre. Politics has changed in the last 15 years since I joined it. Earlier, the centre and states would be very different. Today, you got to have a strong state leadership. We are doing that slowly but steadily. You can’t be hasty and make decisions on impulse. You can’t have a knee-jerk reaction, ‘Ok we got a drubbing here, and therefore, take the decision’.
UNNI RAJEN SHANKER: One of your colleagues talked about the cameo appearance of the leadership. Is it still an issue?
As far as appearances are concerned, whether it’s Rahulji or Soniaji, they have put to use everything at their command in terms of touring—being there for both national and state elections. It’s important for us also to galvanise at our level. It’s easy to look downwards or upwards and blame the system. We, too, should introspect and see where we have not performed and correct our positioning.
AMBREEN KHAN: To what extent do you think that Priyanka Gandhi should lead the Congress?
The Congress democratically elects its leadership—the president and the vice-president. Our leadership today is Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi and we will work according to their policies.
AMBREEN KHAN: Is Priyanka a ray of hope for the Congress?
She has tremendous capability. Whether she would like to get into politics or not is her personal decision. It’s unfair of us to make that call for her.
Tekchand Sonawane: Your partners like the DMK and NCP were involved in scams. Did the Congress suffer a setback in the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections because of the damage caused by its alliances?
An alliance is formed on the basis of a common minimum programme. There are gives and takes, there have been some shortcomings, but those were of the UPA as a whole. To blame allies is wrong. It may have been one of the reasons but it definitely was not the only reason.
SHYAMLAL YADAV: What is your view of the RSS’ role in the present government?
It’s not different from what it’s always been. It’s always been like that. This is a party and a leader that projected something else. And today, you’ve seen the permeation of the command and control system. We have seen it permeate into the organisation of the BJP as office-bearers are coming in. We’ve always said that it will be the case, and it’s slowly turning out to be so. These are very early days, 175 days, but we’re suddenly seeing the influence of that, right?
People talk about Swachh Bharat movement. We started Nirmal Bharat, you reduced its budgetary allocation and replaced it with a communication plank. There’s no action, only statements. All schemes being carried out today are of the UPA. All projects—from train lines to power plants— being inaugurated today were initiated by the UPA. Look at the composition of the cabinet. You talked about presenting a model, clean government. Are you walking the talk? The Congress is already asking these questions. People of the country will start asking these questions soon.
SHYAMLAL YADAV: Should government employees be allowed to attend RSS shakhas?
Obviously not. Government employees are supposed to be neutral. You have a capable person around but you will not keep him because he was aligned with someone! Your civil servant works for the country, not a party or an individual. You got to keep his/her respect and dignity.
SHYAMLAL YADAV: Is the Congress prepared to deal with the RSS?
We have always been prepared to deal with them. It’s not a new phenomenon. It’s been around since the time of Independence or even before. And we’ve always combated them because we believe in a secular, modern India.
RAGHVENDRA RAO: During the first Parliament session of the new government, there was an impression the Congress was struggling to make its presence felt, particularly in the Lok Sabha. With the kind of numbers you have, what is going to be your strategy to play the role of an effective opposition?
I don’t buy that conclusion completely. We have raised a number of important issues. Our numbers have been reduced but our voices have not been drowned. We have been given the responsibility of fighting for the rights of the people of this country, and we will deliver on that in Parliament irrespective of our numbers.
MANOJ CG: As the chief Congress whip in the Lok Sabha, how do you plan to counter the land acquisition Bill if the government brings it in a changed format?
If something is in the interest of the country, we will support it. But if there are changes that will affect 60-65% of the work force of this country, which is in agriculture, we will certainly oppose it. But it is too early to pass a judgment. Let’s wait for the draft to come out.
MANOJ CG: Are you in touch with other opposition parties for larger collaboration on such issues?
Yes, both in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. And we will work together on areas of mutual interest.
MONOJIT MAJUMDAR: Why has the Congress not countered the BJP in Madhya Pradesh, where the latter has been in power for so long?
That’s something I dealt with in the Assembly elections in November last year. And I said the first person who should be held responsible is me. It’s important to start building a campaign almost two years before any state election and we were not able to do that.
MANEESH CHHIBBER: As leader of the Congress in Madhya Pradesh, you accept your responsibility for the Assembly defeat. But Rahul Gandhi has not accepted responsibility for the 2014 Lok Sabha polls defeat. Why is everybody in the party trying to shield him?
That’s not so. He was clear after the Uttar Pradesh elections, he came out and addressed all of you. He was very clear even after the Lok Sabha elections when he came and spoke with all of you. It takes courage to come out in front of the country and say, ‘Yes, we failed and we need to go back to the drawing board’. And he very candidly did that. But we feel that we are all accountable as a party and we need to look within and correct ourselves.
LIZ MATHEW: The BJP, instead of joining hands with political parties, is taking personalities who have clout in a particular community or in a state. And it keeps saying many Congress persons will join its fold. How concerned are you?
I’m not too concerned with the rise or fall of the BJP. I’m more interested in the need to build the party from within. It is very important to keep the family together—not only leaders, but also grassroots workers. I think it’s also important to create that distinction between those committed to the party and those who move away at an opportunistic time.
AMBREEN KHAN: What is the equation of the party’s ‘youth brigade’ with Rahul Gandhi?
Why are we going back to this constant construct of Rahulji with the youth brigade? Mr Gandhi has a connect with every worker of this political party. There are capable leaders across the spectrum. You may come from any age bracket and may still have many productive things to contribute. You keep talking about youth brigade. I’m 45, I have a son who is 19 years old.
RAKESH SINHA: Has the row over Robert Vadra hurt the party?
I would not like to comment on something to do with the life of a private individual.
COOMI KAPOOR: As chief whip of the party, do you think it’s suitable for office-bearers to move into the well of the House to protest?
Why not? I’m not in favour of indiscipline, but if your voice is not being heard from the seat on an important issue, then what option do you have? That’s a part of parliamentary practice.
MANEESH CHHIBBER: In state after state going to polls, like in J&K, Congress leaders are quitting the party in droves. Is that a worrying sign for the party?
I wouldn’t want to say in droves, but if any member leaves, it’s not something   any party would be happy about. It’s at times like these when you know who is committed to the party’s ideology. As I said, it’s better to have a slightly smaller but a more tight-knit family.
APURVA: Starting from Muzaffarnagar in 2013, there have been a spate of communal clashes. Madhya Pradesh has seen six-seven incidents in the last one and a half months. In Delhi, there have been five in the last one month. What do you attribute this rising communal tension to? And what is the Congress doing about it?
One of our mainstays is to ensure a diverse and vibrant India. And secular ideology forms an important cog in that wheel. If you want a progressive India, it cannot be based on the foundation of economic growth. It has to be based on a foundation of unity in diversity, on the ability of every community to prosper, on an environment of peace and stability. That has to be the mainstay of this government. What we have seen in the past six months is a phenomenal rise in incidents like the ones you have mentioned. The Prime Minister had not spoken up until very late. Such communal incidents are going to be a primary concern of the party.
APURVA: But what are you doing on the ground? There was no visible Congress presence on the ground after the incidents in Delhi.
Our MLAs were there.
No, they were not involved in any way. Your Okhla MLA did not even want the registration of an FIR over what had happened.
We may agree to disagree. But the impression I have been given is that the Congress was very much present on the ground. Certainly, I can say for my state that we are very much on the ground.
APURVA: But is this a concerted effort?
Absolutely.
Tekchand Sonawane: Do you think anyone other than a Gandhi can lead the Congress?
I’ll repeat myself. Our party believes in democracy. Each and every Congress person sits and decides who will be the party president and vice-president. We have an unbreakable faith in their leadership and I believe this party will make a comeback.
LIZ MATHEW: What do you think about the BJP’s attempts to adopt icons of the Congress such as Gandhi and Nehru?
To be very candid with you, I believe every leader who has taken this country forward has to be venerated. If the BJP is venerating the leaders of the Congress, who have taken the country forward, I think we should be happy about that. I don’t think we should be concerned about that. But I also believe that it is a matter of convenience that is being played out. And people will see through it.

Phillip Hughes death: An unfinished lifeWill cheap gas last?
Phil Hughes was agricultural in his batting style. But he was humble and affable like a Macksville farm boy. He was a bright and jolly good fellow. He was only 25 years old. We thought he had time on his side… After the initial flurry, Hughes was relegated to a perennial reserve man in the Australian team. He accepted that with a smile, for he thought he had time on his side…
South Africa in 2009 was a magical beginning. A callow left-hander he was then, who upstaged Chris Rogers and Phil Jaques to get into the Test squad. A century in each innings (115 and 160) at Kingsmead, Durban proved to be instrumental in Australia’s series victory. It also vindicated Andrew Hilditch’s (then Australia chief selector) selection policy. But happiness was short-lived.
Hughes went to England and Andrew Flintoff and Co exposed the chinks in his technique against moving ball. He was dropped after scores of 36, 4 and 17 at Cardiff and Lord’s. The return Ashes Down Under in 2010 was even worse. He made 2, 12, 16, 23, 31 and 13 in the six innings he played. Another omission followed.
Hughes had shown signs of returning to form with a gritty 126 against Sri Lanka at Sinhalese Sports Club in September next year. But he failed to build on that, a couple of decent contributions down the line notwithstanding. The Indian summer in 2013 was the worst as Hughes could only manage 147 runs in eight innings against the spin bowling of Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja. Towards the end of that series, however, he had started to unlock the secret which allowed him one more chance at the top level.
Hughes went to England, made 81 not out in the first Test at Nottingham, but his form dipped again. He made 1 and 1 in the second Test at Lord’s, and it turned out to be his last.
A tally of 1,535 runs at 32.65 in 26 Tests and 826 runs at 35.91 in 25 ODIs was pretty average for a cricketer of Hughes’ talent. But we thought he was young enough to make up for lost time…
Hughes was on the verge of Test recall, in place of injured Michael Clarke, when he was taken down by a Sean Abbott—spare a thought for him—bouncer at the Sydney Cricket Ground. What an irony that the ball was, in fact, slow enough to cause the damage. Hughes had already completed his stroke when it arrived. He got his timing wrong.
Former England captain Michael Atherton has rightly reminded us about the brutal nature of the game even in these days of head-to-toe protection. “Even in this helmeted, padded age, cricket remains a brutal game and Hughes’s sickening injury Tuesday was a reminder of that,” he wrote in his The Times column.
Just think about the players then who had faced 90 mph deliveries with very little protective gears. Hughes reportedly was wearing an older, lighter version of his Masuri helmet, but he at least had some protection. Those who stood against Douglas Jardine’s insane Bodyline tactics had none.
Hughes’ injury was an accident and sadly he became a victim of misfortune. As per Tony Grabs, trauma director at St Vincent’s Hospital where Hughes was admitted for surgery, it was one of the rarest of rare cases.
“This was a freakish accident because it was an injury to the neck that caused haemorrhage in the brain. This condition is incredibly rare. It’s called vertebral artery dissection, leading to subarachnoid haemorrhage—that’s the medical term for it,” Grabs told Cricinfo. “If you look in literature, there’s only about 100 cases ever reported, so this is incredibly rare. Only one previous case has ever been reported as the result of a cricket ball,” he added.
Calls for restrictions on the number of bouncers are preposterous. “Without fast bowling, without the physical threat, cricket is a lesser game,” wrote Atherton. Without genuine fast bowling, cricket loses its charm.
In the 1970s, when West Indies fast bowlers were causing mayhem, the great Muhammad Ali was once ushered into the Caribbean dressing room. He picked up a cricket ball and said: “Do you mean to say you play with this stuff, this hard one? It can kill!”
Still, cricket remains a very safe sport. We have seen odd accidents—head injuries, concussions, broken jaws and cheekbones, broken noses and broken ribs. But thankfully, fatal or near-fatal injuries are few and far between. When a solid, hard object, weighing 5.5 ounces, is hurled at 90 mph and the batters have only half a second to adjust, then there will always be an inherent danger. Those who play the game are well aware of it. Hughes’ death is unlikely to change their approach. They won’t be going to the crease with the fear of getting hit.
Of course, Hughes’ death puts the safety issue in the spotlight. Hopefully, more time will be spent to further improve the quality of protective equipment. But nothing in life can be fool-proof. Accidents can happen anytime, even with the best protective gears in place. There’s always an element of luck attached to it.
Hughes was unlucky. His time was up.

India s economic growth likely to be 5.6% in FY15: CitigroupTata Steel close to reopening its top iron ore mine
Driven by reforms momentum and decline in inflation, India is expected to see a growth rate of 5.6 per cent in 2014-15 even as the GDP expansion slowed in the second quarter, says a Citigroup report.
According to the global financial services major, the reform momentum post the assembly polls, improving liquidity conditions paint a bullish picture of the Indian economy.
For the second quarter of this fiscal year, GDP growth slowed to 5.3 per cent, from 5.7 per cent in the previous April-June quarter.
The growth figure for the first half of this fiscal year stands at 5.5 per cent significantly higher than 4.9 per cent in the same period last year.
“The reform momentum post the assembly polls, improving liquidity conditions and project clearances prompt us to retain our full-year growth estimate of 5.6 per cent in the current financial year as against 4.7 per cent last year,” the report said.
The decline in GDP growth rate in the second quarter was mainly on account of subdued performance of agriculture and manufacturing sectors.

Indian employees most engaged globally: ReportTata Steel close to reopening its top iron ore mine
A majority of Indian employees are performing intensely and their work engagement level is highest in the world, a new study says.
At the same time, six out of ten Indian employees are not working to their full potential while the younger employees are constantly on the look out for a new job.
According to BI Worldwide, an employee engagement solutions provider, 51 per cent of Indian employees are performing intensely, making them globally the most engaged in their work.
They are followed by Chinese employees (49 per cent), US (38 per cent), Brazil (36 per cent), Canada (28 per cent) and the UK (24 per cent).
Though the level of employee engagement is very high in India, more than 6 in 10 Indians are not working to their potential, the report said.
“On an average, half of Indians admit to investing only 50-90 per cent of their effort at work. Moreover, three per cent of Indian employees report that they invest only half of their effort or less at work,” the report said.
BI Worldwide conducted the survey to measure employee’s intensity of performance and commitment at work place.
The survey spanned across seven countries namely India, Brazil, Canada, China, US, UK and the Latin American region outside of Brazil and covered nearly 7264 responses.
The report further said the older generation in India would prefer to stay at their current employer for almost seven years while the younger lot is planning to leave much sooner.
According to BI Worldwide research in India, Gen X (born between 1960s to 1980s) employees would like to leave in 4.7 years, while Gen Y (born between 1980s to 1990s) plans on staying for a mere 2.9 years.
Moreover, nearly a quarter of Gen Y employees who work full time in an organisation larger than 500 employees have plans to leave their company within the next year.
“With entire career ahead of them, Gen Y employees are jockeying for position. They are experimenting. And theyâ€™ve realised that their income can grow more rapidly if they job-hop,” the report said.
According to the report, the top five reasons why the Gen Y employees in India plan to leave are fear, job stress, a sense of unfair pay, a bleak or unknown future and for an innovative workplace where they can contribute ideas and make decisions.

RBI Guv Raghuram Rajan s tryst with Tuesdays: Preferred day for policy reviewsTata Steel close to reopening its top iron ore mine
It may be sheer coincidence that all monetary policy reviews by RBI Governor Raghuram Govind Rajan this fiscal have taken place on Tuesdays and this would be the case for the upcoming review this week as well.
In the current fiscal beginning April 1, 2014, Rajan has undertaken four monetary policy reviews so far and the fifth would take place on December 2, with all these five being on Tuesdays.
The former chief economist of IMF, who took over as RBI Governor on September 4, 2013, came out with four policy reviews during the previous fiscal as well and two of them took place again on Tuesdays. The other two reviews by Rajan were on Wednesday and Friday last fiscal.
As a result, six out of eight monetary policies announced by him during his entire tenure so far have been on Tuesdays.
The ninth review, scheduled for this week, takes place on a Tuesday where RBI is widely expected to keep the benchmark rate unchanged.
Incidentally, Rajan has maintained the benchmark interest rate in all four reviews so far in the current fiscal citing high inflation, even as there has been a growing clamour for rate cuts by industry, the government and economists among others.
Surprising the industry and analysts completely, the RBI Governor in his first policy review in September last year raised the short-term policy (repo) rate by 0.25 per cent to 7.5 per cent to keep “worrisome” inflation under check.
His fight against stubborn inflation gained pace the following month as well when he again hiked the repo rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 7.75 per cent.
Rajan put a pause on rate hike on December 18, 2013 but said the RBI will hike interest rates if inflation does not subside in line with the expected declining trend.
Not happy with the inflation trend, RBI did hike repo rate by 0.25 per cent the very next month that is in January 29, 2014 by 0.25 per cent to 8 per cent. Since then, the central bank has left its benchamark rate unchanged despite pressure from all quarters.

M-commerce to contribute up to 70 pct of online shoppingTata Steel close to reopening its top iron ore mine
Shopping online through smartphones is expected to be a game changer shortly and industry experts believe that m-commerce would contribute up to 70 per cent of their total revenues.
“In India, the mobile internet traffic now outweighs personal computer traffic. With increasing penetration of smartphones, India is all set to be a massive market for m-commerce. The marketing strategies for e-commerce companies will increasingly be tailored to suit the rising adoption of smartphones, social media and improving customer experience across touch points and platforms,” Amazon India Vice President and Country Manager Amit Agarwal told PTI.
He said that more than 40 per cent of their traffic comes from mobile devices.
Mobile internet users in India are estimated to be 120 million compared to 100 million users using internet on their personal computers.
“Close to 60 per cent of our orders are coming over mobile now. It is growing really fast. We get more traffic on the mobile than we get on personal computers. Within the next 12 months over 75 per cent of our orders will be on mobile,” Snapdeal co-founder Kunal Bahl said.
Fashion portal retailer Myntra.com expects close to 70 per cent of revenue coming through mobiles this fiscal.
“Myntra.com has witnessed phenomenal activity on the m-commerce front, with smartphones gaining prominence as the preferred mode to access and shop for fashion brands in the country.
“Currently, close to 50 per cent of our business is driven by m-commerce and with the launch of our Mobile App across all platforms (Android, iOS and Windows), we expect this figure to grow to 70 per cent by end of this fiscal,” Myntra Chief Product and Technology Officer Shamik Sharma said.
M-commerce is estimated to be 30 per cent of the USD 3 billion e-tailing industry and is likely to grow to nearly 40 per cent of the industry that is expected to be 32 billion by 2020, according to Technopak Senior Vice President, Retail and Consumer Products Ankur Bisen.
Flipkart Senior Director Marketing Mausam Bhatt said e-commerce industry is gradually progressing to be a m-commerce industry.
“I think the way e-commerce industry is evolving it is becoming more of a mobile-commerce industry. If you look at Flipkart a year ago, less than 10 per cent of our orders, transactions and visits used to come from mobile commerce.
“Now those numbers are greater than 50 per cent for us. It is accelerating at a very rapid pace. We are seeing more than 2 times or 3 times growth from the mobile front compared to desktop, where Flipkart is growing overall but mobile is growing at a much faster pace,” he said.
For fashion portal Jabong, m-commerce constitutes 30 per cent of its sales and Founder and Chief Executive Officer Arun Chandra Mohan said it will drive the growth of the sector.
“The internet penetration is increasing exponentially. The existing users are spending more time on internet. New users are increasing significantly. The mobile users are scaling up. So even in Jabong, we have invested heavily on mobile app.
“Close to 30 per cent of our revenues is coming from mobile. Penetration is increasing and existing users are coming back very strongly. M-commerce will drive the e-commerce growth going forward and right now it is a very strong enabler,” he said.
Flipkart’s Bhatt said there is an increasing growth in commerce from the non-metro cities which is primarily driven through smartphones.
He pointed out that in India almost 70-75 per cent of the people primarily access internet via their phones, which is driving a lot of growth for a lot of companies.
“It enables them to expand their market outside of the traditional metro regions where a lot of e-commerce players are historically focused on and that is one of the big driving factors why e-commerce companies are now focusing on the mobile segment,” he said.
He further said m-commerce story in India is proving to be a game changer at the global level.
“If you look at the benchmark from the US companies or the Chinese companies, the percentage of revenue that is driven from m-commerce in India is significantly higher than lot of those companies and countries,” he said.
Myntra’s Sharma said mobile is an important mode to increase revenues and acquire customers.
“Mobile is now one of our most strategic channels for driving revenue and customer acquisition. We are investing to build strong technology and marketing platforms that will allow us to accelerate our growth on mobile,” Sharma said.

Congress leader joins chorus: Make Sanskrit must till ClassXWritten by Ruhi Tewari | New Delhi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 4:20 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 9:37 am
As the controversy over the NDA government’s decision to replace German with Sanskrit as the third language in Kendriya Vidyalaya schools rages, a Congress leader has now thrown his weight behind Sanskrit. Former Member of Parliament from Delhi Mahabal Mishra has said that Sanskrit should be taught as a mandatory subject at least till Class X.
Mishra, a patron of the Sanskrit Shikshak Sangh (SSS) — the group that took the language issue to court and prompted the HRD Ministry’s decision — held a meeting of the organisation on Sunday to “discuss the future strategy”.
As per details of the meeting, which were written down by SSS president D K Jha, Mishra congratulated the Sangh for “the victory of Sanskrit as a third language in the Delhi High Court while assuring full cooperation in the fight for the language”. According to the details, Mishra also said that if Sanskrit is not taught in schools in the country, “Indian culture will die out”.
When contacted, Mishra told The Indian Express that he would take up the matter in all relevant forums.
“Yes, as the sanrakshak (patron) of the SSS, I called for a meeting today where we discussed the future course of action to ensure Sanskrit is taught to children. Indian culture and tradition are empty without Sanskrit; it glues us all together. I believe the language should be made compulsory at least till Class X. How the government does it is up to them. I am not talking to any government or political party. I am talking as a citizen. I will raise the issue wherever and whenever I can at appropriate forums,” Mishra, who has been a patron for the past few years, said.
However, he did not comment on the issue of German being scrapped as the third language in KVs. He said that he wasn’t against any language, but that he firmly believed Sanskrit should be taught in the country. He also said the “ills prevalent in our society” will not end till Sanskrit is taught on a wide scale. Sunday’s meeting was held at Mishra’s residence.
Incidentally, while Sanskrit was the mandatory third language in KVs since 2001, it was when Mishra’s party was in power at the Centre that German was introduced as an alternative in 2010-11.
The Indian Express had earlier reported how the SSS had said that its next move would be to make all other schools drop foreign languages as the third language.
According to Jha, Mishra also assured that he would garner all possible support from his party on the issue.
The SSS, an umbrella body of Sanskrit teachers and scholars, had earlier moved the Delhi High Court alleging that the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan’s decision to introduce German as a third language in place of Sanskrit was against the education policy and the three language formula. The three language formula states that schools ought to teach Hindi, English and one modern Indian language.
The controversy erupted when, continued…

Andhra Pradesh govt seeks more fiscal elbowroomWritten by Shaji Vikraman , Harish Damodaran | Mumbai/ New Delhi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 4:16 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 9:52 am
Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu’s government has sought the Centre’s permission to enable the residuary state to borrow up to 7 per cent of its GDP for the next five years, indicative of the potentially huge fiscal costs arising from the creation of Telangana. The TDP government’s borrowing proposal is way over the mandated borrowing limits for states.
Naidu’s government has justified the demand — requiring an amendment to the AP Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM) — mainly on grounds of having to finance the building of a new state capital to make up for the loss of Hyderabad to Telangana, besides infrastructure for the new state.
The existing FRBM laws cap annual borrowings — that is, the gross fiscal deficit — to a maximum of 3 per cent of any state’s GDP.
AP Chief Secretary I Y R Krishna Rao confirmed that the state had sought relaxation in its FRBM law to run a fiscal deficit up to 7 per cent. “We need to borrow more for building a new capital and infrastructure creation. Given our weak manufacturing and services base, especially after loss of Hyderabad, we are left with very little resource-raising options today,” he told The Indian Express.
Although the residuary state does have a relatively prosperous farm economy, much of the incomes from it aren’t taxable, Rao added.
Interestingly, the Telangana government under K Chandrashekar Rao — whose Telangana Rashtra Samithi is not part of the ruling BJP-led alliance at the Centre, unlike Naidu’s Telugu Desam Party — has also pitched for relaxation of FRBM targets to help secure more borrowings.
The Centre, for now, isn’t receptive to either of the states’ demands — coming as they do on top of farm loan waiver schemes announced by both governments that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), for one, hasn’t taken kindly to.
Deviating from FRBM targets normally attracts penalties in the form of the errant states being denied the facility of concessional rates on loans from the National Small Savings Fund. Besides, there is the danger of markets punishing states viewed as profligate. West Bengal and Punjab, for instance, have had to borrow at higher rates than other states in recent government loan auctions.
Former RBI Governor C Rangarajan, who also headed the 12th Finance Commission, said that allowing any state to contract excess borrowings for five-year periods would push up its interest burden — both on account of addition to overall debt as well as the markets demanding higher rates in auctions.
Rangarajan suggested that a preferable alternative would be to provide a one-time financial package from the Centre to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in the post-bifurcation scenario. Such a package — as opposed to blanket permission for ramping up borrowings — is what the 14th Finance Commission is expected to recommend.
The Commission, headed by former RBI Governor Y V Reddy, continued…

Parents beware: this round of Frozen-mania wont end after the holidays. Idina Menzel says a sequel is in the works.DISNEY JUST WON’T “LET IT GO” – HERE COMES “FROZEN” PART TWO
TELL YOUR WALLET TO “LET IT GO” – “FROZEN” FRENZY NOT OVER YET
JUST “LET IT GO” – “LET IT GO” TO BE STUCK IN YOUR HEAD FOR ETERNITY
REPORTERS KEEP USING “LET IT GO” PUNS AND WE’RE JUST JOINING IN. We have to — the highest-grossing animated film of all time is getting a part two, according to its star.
Idina Menzel, the voice of wintery princess Elsa, told the Telegraph that a sequel to “Frozen” is indeed “in the works.”
This shouldn’t be shocking to anyone who was awake and alive last winter, when “Frozen”-mania overtook the country, and its hit song “Let It Go” became the national anthem of children who control their parents’ minivan stereo.

The overwhelming popularity of the PG-rated film caused stores to sell out of their “Frozen” merchandise so rapidly the “national shortage” of “Frozen” supplies made headlines for weeks. (One mom proudly told the New York Post that she went to 42 stores to find an Elsa dress for her 6 1/2-year-old. A few paragraphs later, the story was about parents getting in all-out brawls.)
But Disney is giving people what they want, and then some : after $1.2 billion in worldwide ticket sales, no opportunity to monopolize on the film’s popularity will be left unattempted. There will be a “Frozen” Broadway musical, a “Frozen” theme park attraction, “Frozen” on ice, a “Frozen” sing-a-long DVD … and this holiday season, the National Retail Federation’s annual survey of top toys showed that one in every five people buying a toy for a girl will choose a “Frozen” item. Maybe the “Frozen” headphones ? “Frozen”  soup ? “Frozen”  toilet seat cover ? This is the first time in 11 years that Barbie didn’t hold the number one spot . Disney also reported that more than 3 million “Frozen” dresses have been sold in 2014. That’s the equivalent of every person in the state of Mississippi wearing an Elsa or Anna costume.
The true cost of “Frozen” fame was not felt in the coffers of Disney but in the eardrums of parents who after allowing their children to view the film were treated to the following two questions for months on end: “Can we watch/listen to ‘Frozen?’” and “Can we watch/listen to Frozen again?” The soundtrack is one of only two albums to go platinum in 2014 and the three official “Let It Go” videos on YouTube have more than 850 million views combined.
Some parents reveled in the high-pitched ballads; others bemoaned that “Frozen”  ruined their lives .
“I definitely did not get into the shower thinking ‘I’m gonna sing ‘Let It Go!’” says Scott Kramer of Los Angeles when he begins telling the story of how his anti-”Let It Go” video went viral on YouTube. Kramer, a father of an 8-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son, realized things had gone too far when he caught himself absentmindedly singing “The cold doesn’t bother me anyway!” while washing himself. He teamed up with his wife and another couple to create “A Frozen Father (“Let It Go” Dad Parody),” which now has 2.5 million views on YouTube. 
Seated at a piano in front of a fireplace with Anna and Elsa dolls on the mantel, Kramer’s friend Josh Elson sings, “It’s in my head, it’s in my dreams, / this freaking song is haunting me / I’ve had enough, this has to stop / Please make it stop / Let it go…”
“I mean, it’s a great song,” Kramer said. “But it was just like, enough already.”
His YouTube fame was outpaced by parents Sam and Nia Rader of Carroll, Texas, whose video “Good Looking Parents Sing Disney’s Frozen (Love Is an Open Door)” attracted 18 million views and a slew of its own parodies including “Better Looking Parents ACTUALLY Sing Frozen “Love is an Open Door.” Although the Raders’ daughter Symphony seemed utterly uninterested in “Frozen” in their viral video, Nia said she’s thrilled that there will be more of “Frozen” for her daughter to enjoy.
“The princesses I grew up with, like the Little Mermaid, she gave up her voice and transformed her body to find love. That’s an unrealistic idea to put into little girls’ minds,” Nia said. “In ‘Frozen,’ they put family above everything else.”
The Raders said Symphony, age 4, has already started saving up the dimes she earns from her “good behavior chart” to buy the “Frozen” sequel when it is released.
Kramer’s children are also psyched for “Frozen” part two, as they have each seen the existing movie about 100 times, he estimates. For him and the other parents whose one thought (crystallizing like an icy blast?) at the news of more “Frozen” is a tinge of dread, the plan is just to accept the train is coming.
“First thing when the trailer for the sequel comes out, we’ll have to make a follow up video,” he said. “One that will get us mentally prepared for the onslaught, I guess.”

San(dear), your this logic is quite accurate. Will surely work out. But since the interest rate is based on a lagging indicator known as inflation, and lowering of interest rates too can take some time, it is difficult to fathom such depths of view for a common invester, sometimes also known as retail invester and poor invester.

On Black Friday  Americans Confront the Walmart 1 Percent: Pay Employees a Living Wagereddit
Walmart won't pay its employees enough to afford Thanksgiving dinner, so they're holding food drives for their employees. Seriously. It's been reported that an Oklahoma City Walmart set up bins for underpaid associates to donate canned goods to other underpaid associates.
Walmart workers have a better idea: Pay us enough to put food on the table.
On Black Friday, the busiest shopping day of the year, tens of millions of Americans will travel to Walmart stores to look for holiday discounts on computers, toys and cellphones as well as to buy groceries and basic household items. But at more than 1,600 of Walmart's 4,000 stores, shoppers will be greeted by Walmart employees handing out leaflets and holding picket signs -- "Walmart: Stop Bullying, Stop Firing, Start Paying" and "We're Drawing a Line at the Poverty Line: $25,000/year" -- protesting the company's abusive labor practices, including poverty-level wages, stingy benefits, and irregular work schedules that make it impossible for their families to make ends meet.
The Black Friday rallies and demonstrations represent a dramatic escalation of the growing protest movement among employees of America's largest private employer. But they also represent the vanguard of a sharp challenge to the nation's widening economic divide and the declining standard of living among the majority of Americans.
National leaders and community groups from every corner of the country will join Walmart workers at the Black Friday protests. Members of Congress,  women's groups, and environmental and consumer organizations have all pledged support, saying that the Walmart workers' fight is a fight for all Americans.  This week 226 organizations -- including the National Organization for Women, the NAACP, the Sierra Club, MoveOn.Org, the U.S. Student Association, Dream Defenders, and the AFL-CIO  --  sent a letter to Walmart chairman and owner Rob Walton calling for Walmart to raise pay to $15 an hour and provide consistent, full-time work for its workers; provide working women with good jobs that pay decent wages; and create a workplace that fosters inclusivity, appreciation and understanding.
Last week U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) and U.S. Rep. George Miller (D-California) spoke at a congressional briefing to discuss a business model that some are calling the "Walmart Economy," defined as an economy "where a few profit significantly on the backs of the working poor and a diminishing middle class." Joined by Walmart workers, Warren said , "It is good to hear workers' voices in the halls of Congress. No one in this country should work full-time and still live in poverty, and that's what raising the minimum wage is all about."
It is sometimes difficult to recognize historical events as they unfold, but it is likely that future generations will look at these Walmart protests as a major turning point that helped move the nation in a new direction, similar to the sit-down strikes among Flint auto workers in 1937, the Woolworth lunch-counter sit-ins by civil-rights activists in 1960, and the first Earth Day in 1970, which jump-started the environmental movement.
The swelling anger over inequality began with the Occupy Wall Street demonstrations in September 2011 and spread quickly from New York City to cities across the country. The Occupiers were soon evicted from the parks and other places they temporarily inhabited, but the movement's message has continued to resonate with the American public. Activists as well as many politicians and pundits have embraced its "1 percent vs. 99 percent" theme, which has quickly become part of Americans' everyday conversations.
Public opinion polls reveal that a significant majority of Americans believe that there is too much power in the hands of a few rich people and corporations, that our political and economic system unfairly favors the wealthy, and that wealthy people don't pay their fair share of taxes. Surveys also document that Americans think that people who work full-time should not be trapped in poverty. A Pew survey conducted earlier this year found that 73 percent of Americans -- including 90 percent of Democrats, 71 percent of independents, and 53 percent of Republicans -- favor raising the federal minimum wage from its current level of $7.25 an hour to $10.10 an hour. Many think it should be higher.
But public opinion alone doesn't translate into changes in politics and public policy. For that to occur, people have to take collective action. The past year has witnessed a growing protest movement for social and economic justice. Workers at fast-food chains like McDonalds, Taco Bell, Burger King, and Wendy's have mounted several protest actions, including one-day strikes at more than a thousand restaurants in cities around the country, demanding a base wage of $15 an hour. Earlier this year Seattle adopted a citywide $15-an-hour minimum wage -- part of a growing wave of municipal minimum-wage laws.
From the police and prosecutors in Ferguson to Walmart and its owners, abuse of power by the few is keeping many Americans living in fear. Every day average Americans must worry about police violence, the possibility of being unjustly fired, and being unable to find the next meal for their children.
Our communities cannot thrive when they are held back from earning a decent living by the biggest corporation in our country.
No institution epitomizes the realities of hypercapitalism as much as Walmart, so it isn't surprising that the giant retailer has increasingly become the target of protests, not only by its employees but by a broad coalition of consumers, community groups, unions, and others.
Walmart -- with 1.3 million employees in the U.S. and more than 2 million around the globe -- has probably confronted more opposition on more different issues than any corporation in history.
To environmentalists "Walmart" is a dirty word. Despite its ballyhooed sustainability work, Walmart's greenhouse-gas emissions are growing, not shrinking.  Walmart's heavily promoted sustainability initiatives have done more to improve the company's image than to help the environment, according to a new report by the nonprofit Institute for Local Self-Reliance.  Last year the company pleaded guilty to violating the Clean Water Act and had to pay an $82-million fine for improperly handling hazardous waste, pesticides, and other materials in violation of federal laws. Walmart also finances politicians who fight action to address the climate crisis, including funding the campaigns of some of the most powerful climate-change deniers in Congress.
Women employees filed suit against the company for its longstanding practice of paying women less than men for the same jobs.
Labor, faith-based groups, and organizations representing small businesses in dozens of cities have waged successful battles to stop Walmart from opening new stores, warning that the presence of a Walmart outlet drives out locally owned merchants and depresses wages for employees in unionized grocery stores and other retailers.
Immigrant-rights activists have condemned Walmart for knowingly doing business with contractors who exploit undocumented immigrants to work as Walmart's janitors. On several occasions, federal agents have raided Walmart stores across the nation and searched offices at the company's Bentonville, Arkansas, headquarters to investigate its abuses.
Public safety advocates have criticized Walmart for being the nation's largest seller of guns and ammunition . Media exposés of Walmart's membership in the right-wing American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) forced the company (but not the Walton Family Foundation) to withdraw its affiliation. ALEC is now infamous for pushing a conservative legislative agenda, including the notorious "Stand Your Ground" laws, which came out of an ALEC working committee co-chaired by a Walmart executive in 2005 and contributed to the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012.
Public education advocates have criticized the Walton family for donating tens of millions of dollars to conservative organizations and political candidates who seek to privatize public schools and promote high-stakes testing and huge subsidies to private education companies.
Members of Congress have criticized Walmart for paying its employees so little that many are eligible for food stamps and Medicaid, forcing taxpayers to pick up the tab for the company's poverty-pay policies. A report by the House of Representatives' Committee on Education and the Workforce examined data received from the State of Wisconsin and found that a single Walmart store could cost taxpayers between $900,000 and $1.7 million a year in government subsidies.
The New York Times uncovered Walmart's massive bribery of Mexican officials, reporting that the company paid more than $24 million in bribes to gain approvals to expand its operations. Top Walmart executives knew about the bribery scheme but quickly ended an internal investigation and even promoted one of the company officials involved in the scandal.
Last year workers at Thai shrimp farms supplying Walmart went on strike, protesting low wages, inadequate toilet access, and substandard housing. Human Rights Watch reported that working conditions were akin to debt bondage.
Walmart has also recently earned well-deserved negative publicity for its complicity in thwarting safety improvements at Bangladesh sweatshops that make clothes sold in Walmart stores. One of them was the eight-story Rana Plaza factory building near Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, where, last year, at least 1,134 workers were killed after the building collapsed -- the deadliest garment-industry disaster in history. To make matters worse, Walmart has refused to sign a Bangladesh fire- and building-safety accord drawn up by human-rights groups and signed by many other global retailers.
But beyond these specific offenses, Walmart has become a symbol -- and a major cause -- of the nation's widening gap between the super-rich and the rest.
Last year Walmart made $16 billion in profits. The company's controlling family, the Waltons, is the richest family in America, with nearly $150 billion in wealth. That is more than the total wealth of 43 percent of American families combined, yet most Walmart workers make less than just $25,000 a year.
The Waltons can afford to pay all their employees $15 an hour and provide full-time work -- enough to live with dignity and raise a family. But they won't -- not unless people speak up.
In what became a major embarrassment for the company, the Cleveland Plain-Dealer reported that a Walmart store in Canton, Ohio, had organized a food drive, asking its own employees to donate to their hungry coworkers so that they could afford a Thanksgiving meal. The store manager no doubt meant to help his employees, but for most Americans the food drive symbolized Walmart's greed rather than its good intentions. The incident quickly became front-page news, an instant sensation on radio talk shows and in the blogosphere, the subject of editorial cartoons, and the butt of jokes by Stephen Colbert and others.
Economists note that if Walmart paid its employees at least $25,000 a year, a million and a half workers would be lifted out of poverty. That would mean more money staying in communities to support local businesses, helping create at least 100,000 new jobs. Demos , a nonprofit research group, released a report finding that Walmart could easily pay every employee $14.89 without raising prices by simply not buying its own stock to further enrich the Walton family.
Not surprisingly, a growing coalition of Americans has rallied behind Walmart workers not only to help them win better conditions at work but to challenge Walmart's and the Walton family's political influence.
Over the past year protests against the company have escalated, led by Organization United for Respect at Walmart (OUR Walmart), a nationwide network of Walmart workers.
This crescendo of conscience has put Walmart on the defensive. Its television ads aren't pushing consumer goods but instead seek to persuade viewers that Walmart is an ideal employer . In recent years the company has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on philanthropy, hoping that its charitable giving to food banks, homeless shelters and various nonprofit groups will cleanse its image as a corporate predator.
But Walmart's propaganda campaign doesn't seem to be working. Calls for change at Walmart continue to grow louder. Many unlikely suspects have jumped aboard the anti-Walmart train.   Even Fortune magazine -- hardly a radical rag -- recently observed that "Wal-Mart can afford to give its workers a 50% raise" without hurting its stock value. Writing in the Wall Street Journal, Al Lewis chided Walmart for paying its employees "always low wages" and, in turn, "creating a growing class of working poor."
Walmart pays attention to these protests. We've already seen recent successes, like when Walmart changed its policy on pregnant women after workers submitted a resolution to the company, and when the retailer created a system that gives workers better access to hours by allowing them to sign up for open shifts online.
Walmart workers have escalated their online organizing and community outreach ahead of Black Friday, allowing customers and community members to join the fight for $25,000 and an end to illegal retaliation against employees who raise their voices against company practices.
This year the day after Thanksgiving will be remembered not as the biggest shopping day of the year but as the day Americans took action to demand that Walmart, the country's largest employer, pay workers livable wages and play a part in improving our economy.

Life hacks: 7 things successful people do in their 30s7 Things Successful People Do In Their 30s
By Richard Feloni | Business Insider –  Thu 27 Nov, 2014 1:10 AM IST
Print
Mario Tama/Getty One of the most common pieces of advice is to not let work keep you from your loved ones.
Your 30s are typically a time of settling down. You can't get away with many of the risks or bad habits that may have characterized your 20s.
For instance, many 30-somethings focus so much on raising a family and building a career that they neglect important relationships and ignore opportunities they may never get again.
We've collected below the most common advice from those who have already experienced their 30s.
1. They spend time with people who add value to their lives.
Manson collected over 600 responses from readers who have lived through their 30s, and one of the most common pieces of advice was to stop spending time with those who don't treat you well and instead spend more time with loved ones.
"Don't just work. Make memories. The older you get, the harder it is to make meaningful relationships," writes Microsoft product designer Michael Dorian Bach on Quora.
The entrepreneur and blogger James Altucher writes on Quora that you also shouldn't forget that your parents grow older as you do. "When I was 34 I hung up the phone on my dad in an argument and never returned his calls. Six months later he had a stroke and died. A week before that he had emailed me to say hello but I didn't return the email. I'm sorry, Dad."
2. They pursue their loftier aspirations.
Twenty-somethings often begin their careers with big goals that they set aside to settle for a job they're not passionate about. Before they know it, a temporary job becomes a career.
An anonymous poster writes on Quora that the biggest mistake of his or her 30s was to become "addicted to a monthly salary," in the sense that he or she chose job security over career satisfaction.
While it's certainly more difficult to start a business or switch industries when you're 35 as opposed to 25, it's not impossible and may be the right choice.
Vera Wang, for example, didn't enter the fashion industry until she was 40 and now she's one of the world's premier designers.
3. They don't obsess about the future.
Manson recounts that one of the biggest lessons of his 20s was that there's not a magical moment where you start feeling like an adult who has it all figured out. He was happy to learn that his older readers said the same thing about their 30s.
"Unless you are already dead — mentally, emotionally, and socially — you cannot anticipate your life 5 years into the future. It will not develop as you expect. So just stop it. Stop assuming you can plan far ahead, stop obsessing about what is happening right now because it will change anyway, and get over the control issue about your life's direction," his reader going by Thomas writes .
It's healthy to have goals for you and your family, but don't stress out over specifics. Acknowledge that you still have plenty left to learn and that you're going to continue to grow as a person in unexpected ways.
4. They decide whether they want kids or not.
Kids certainly are not for everyone, but the majority of those who wrote to Manson or posted on Quora say they realized that putting off having children for an ideal situation is a bad idea. If you want to have kids, have them before it's too late.
"You don’t have the time. You don't have the money. You need to perfect your career first. They'll end your life as you know it. Oh shut up … Kids are great. They make you better in every way. They push you to your limits. They make you happy. You should not defer having kids," Manson's reader Kevin writes .
Melia Robinson/Business Insider Make time for exercise. Your future self will thank you.   5. They take care of their health.
With a growing list of responsibilities, one of the first things that can go is making exercise and healthy eating habits a priority. But think of putting forth a little effort in both areas as a long-term investment.
"Be healthy. That is priority 1. Don't get into your 30s being slow and tired all the time. It sucks," Michael Dorian Bach writes on Quora.
Adam Dehner says on Quora that "at 41, I've got a list of physical complaints that might not have come about had I been healthier."
6. They establish a financial foundation for the future.
Hopefully you used your 20s to figure out a way to pay back the student loan debt statistics say you most likely had after graduating, and also started saving. But if you hit 30 and you've set nothing aside, it's not too late. By this point, though, you need to start saving for your retirement.
Altucher writes about the many times in his 30s that he bet practically all of his money on a business venture and then lost all of it. He is doing well now, but he looks back on his failures as the result of recklessness.
Determine what percentage of your paycheck you can easily live without and consider setting up an automatic investment in a 401k and/or other savings accounts.
7. They still enjoy themselves.
And finally, just because you're not in your 20s anymore doesn't mean you need to stop having fun. Bach writes on Quora that he spent most of his 30s chasing money, and it only made him unhappy and more cynical about life.
Quora user Jeff Miller adds that he learned the best times in his 30s were going on dates with his wife and playing with his kids. Among all participants, there was a recurring theme that none of the money you work hard to make matters if you're not enjoying life.

Gruden postgame: McCoy competed  secondary struggledBy Isabelle Khurshudyan November 30 Follow @ikhurshudyan
Despite a decent performance, Colt McCoy could not pull out a victory for the Redskins, as they lost, 49-27, against the Indianapolis Colts. The Washington Post's Gene Wang and Dan Steinberg discuss how the lackluster defense was mostly to blame. (Kyle Barss/The Washington Post)
After the Redskins’ 49-27 loss to the Colts , Washington Coach Jay Gruden spoke to the media about the performance of quarterback Colt McCoy and the blown coverages on defense.
On the defensive mix-ups in coverage:
“Players have to start stepping up and taking some accountability at some point, and we’ve got to do a better job coaching. That’s all I can say. But to have those guys wide open like that, it’s unheard of on simple coverage calls.”
“I don’t know. We do have a young group back there. In fairness to them, they’re young. There’s not a lot of experience back there in the secondary. (Brandon) Meriweather goes out. Phillip Thomas comes in. You’ve got Amerson, who’s a second-year guy. (Bashaud) Breeland is a first-year guy. Phillip Thomas is a young player. You’ve got (Chase) Minnifield, who hasn’t played much. You’ve got (Greg) Ducre, who hasn’t played much. It’s a young group back there other than Ryan Clark, so mistakes are going to be had. We’ve just got to keep coaching. That’s all we can do.”
On the defensive inconsistency:
“Consistency is a big part of football. A lot of teams look very good for a quarter or a drive or a half or maybe a couple games, but the really good teams can do it week in and week out. Right now, that’s what we’re trying to figure out. Defense gave us a great opportunity early in the game. We had a chance to go up 14-0, 10-0, 7-0. We blew it on offense. We got out of the gate way too slow as an offensive unit. It looked like we were sleepwalking out of the huddle. It’s just not a very spirited performance on offense, in my opinion. Then on defense, they tried the best they could.”
On if quarterback Colt McCoy will be the starter next week:
“Yeah, Colt competed. There’s some things I wish we would’ve done differently, [as] play-callers and execution-wise, but I feel like he competed and did a nice job out there. Obviously, he’s frustrated at the first-half performance. We all are. The first half was not good on any level. But he competed, came back and gave us a chance there.”
On the fourth and inches call in the second half:
“I thought we had to go for it there. Originally, I had a nice inside power play called, but then when they took the timeout, I saw [how] they lined up, and I saw they had a guy playing bump-and-run on DeSean (Jackson) with a safety and not much help, so I decided to try a play-action pass and launch it to DeSean. I got a little greedy, that’s all I can say. Then we blew the protection.”
“It was a big play in the game, that’s for sure. Should have punted it. Should have run it. Should have done something other than what I did.”
Redskins quarterback Colt McCoy talks with head coach Jay Gruden. (Darron Cummings/Associated Press)
On Colt McCoy in the first half:
“Obviously, the first half did not turn out exactly how we hoped it would turn out. The game is four quarters, and he came back in the third quarter, got us a couple big drives, made some good throws, obviously the great throw on the scramble touchdown where he got hit and spun around. He did a good job competing. I don’t think it was the start we wanted, but I thought Colt competed and did some good things.”
On the secondary:
“We’re really short in the secondary. We’ve just got to keep coaching them. Some of these mistakes we’re making as a group back there are unheard of. We’ve just got to get them coached up and try to eliminate them.”

Congress leader joins chorus: Make Sanskrit must till Class XWritten by Ruhi Tewari | New Delhi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 4:20 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 9:37 am
As the controversy over the NDA government’s decision to replace German with Sanskrit as the third language in Kendriya Vidyalaya schools rages, a Congress leader has now thrown his weight behind Sanskrit. Former Member of Parliament from Delhi Mahabal Mishra has said that Sanskrit should be taught as a mandatory subject at least till Class X.
Mishra, a patron of the Sanskrit Shikshak Sangh (SSS) — the group that took the language issue to court and prompted the HRD Ministry’s decision — held a meeting of the organisation on Sunday to “discuss the future strategy”.
As per details of the meeting, which were written down by SSS president D K Jha, Mishra congratulated the Sangh for “the victory of Sanskrit as a third language in the Delhi High Court while assuring full cooperation in the fight for the language”. According to the details, Mishra also said that if Sanskrit is not taught in schools in the country, “Indian culture will die out”.
When contacted, Mishra told The Indian Express that he would take up the matter in all relevant forums.
“Yes, as the sanrakshak (patron) of the SSS, I called for a meeting today where we discussed the future course of action to ensure Sanskrit is taught to children. Indian culture and tradition are empty without Sanskrit; it glues us all together. I believe the language should be made compulsory at least till Class X. How the government does it is up to them. I am not talking to any government or political party. I am talking as a citizen. I will raise the issue wherever and whenever I can at appropriate forums,” Mishra, who has been a patron for the past few years, said.
However, he did not comment on the issue of German being scrapped as the third language in KVs. He said that he wasn’t against any language, but that he firmly believed Sanskrit should be taught in the country. He also said the “ills prevalent in our society” will not end till Sanskrit is taught on a wide scale. Sunday’s meeting was held at Mishra’s residence.
Incidentally, while Sanskrit was the mandatory third language in KVs since 2001, it was when Mishra’s party was in power at the Centre that German was introduced as an alternative in 2010-11.
The Indian Express had earlier reported how the SSS had said that its next move would be to make all other schools drop foreign languages as the third language.
According to Jha, Mishra also assured that he would garner all possible support from his party on the issue.
The SSS, an umbrella body of Sanskrit teachers and scholars, had earlier moved the Delhi High Court alleging that the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan’s decision to introduce German as a third language in place of Sanskrit was against the education policy and the three language formula. The three language formula states that schools ought to teach Hindi, English and one modern Indian language.
The controversy erupted when, continued…

Andhra Pradesh govt seeks more fiscal elbow roomWritten by Shaji Vikraman , Harish Damodaran | Mumbai/ New Delhi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 4:16 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 9:52 am
Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu’s government has sought the Centre’s permission to enable the residuary state to borrow up to 7 per cent of its GDP for the next five years, indicative of the potentially huge fiscal costs arising from the creation of Telangana. The TDP government’s borrowing proposal is way over the mandated borrowing limits for states.
Naidu’s government has justified the demand — requiring an amendment to the AP Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM) — mainly on grounds of having to finance the building of a new state capital to make up for the loss of Hyderabad to Telangana, besides infrastructure for the new state.
The existing FRBM laws cap annual borrowings — that is, the gross fiscal deficit — to a maximum of 3 per cent of any state’s GDP.
AP Chief Secretary I Y R Krishna Rao confirmed that the state had sought relaxation in its FRBM law to run a fiscal deficit up to 7 per cent. “We need to borrow more for building a new capital and infrastructure creation. Given our weak manufacturing and services base, especially after loss of Hyderabad, we are left with very little resource-raising options today,” he told The Indian Express.
Although the residuary state does have a relatively prosperous farm economy, much of the incomes from it aren’t taxable, Rao added.
Interestingly, the Telangana government under K Chandrashekar Rao — whose Telangana Rashtra Samithi is not part of the ruling BJP-led alliance at the Centre, unlike Naidu’s Telugu Desam Party — has also pitched for relaxation of FRBM targets to help secure more borrowings.
The Centre, for now, isn’t receptive to either of the states’ demands — coming as they do on top of farm loan waiver schemes announced by both governments that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), for one, hasn’t taken kindly to.
Deviating from FRBM targets normally attracts penalties in the form of the errant states being denied the facility of concessional rates on loans from the National Small Savings Fund. Besides, there is the danger of markets punishing states viewed as profligate. West Bengal and Punjab, for instance, have had to borrow at higher rates than other states in recent government loan auctions.
Former RBI Governor C Rangarajan, who also headed the 12th Finance Commission, said that allowing any state to contract excess borrowings for five-year periods would push up its interest burden — both on account of addition to overall debt as well as the markets demanding higher rates in auctions.
Rangarajan suggested that a preferable alternative would be to provide a one-time financial package from the Centre to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in the post-bifurcation scenario. Such a package — as opposed to blanket permission for ramping up borrowings — is what the 14th Finance Commission is expected to recommend.
The Commission, headed by former RBI Governor Y V Reddy, continued…

KiOR got 100 million from Khosla and GatesBy Steven Mufson October 21, 2013 Follow @StevenMufson
The Silicon Valley venture capital firm run by Vinod Khosla has pledged to inject an additional $85 million into the cash-starved biofuel maker Kior , and a Bill Gates fund is going to chip in $15 million, too.
Kior, which has fallen far short of its production forecasts this year, said Monday that Khosla and Gates will help finance a second refinery, which would convert wood chips into gasoline and diesel. Kior chief executive Fred Cannon said the company could be cash flow positive in 2015.
Khosla said in an interview that he will increase his total investment in the company to $125 million and that Gates will invest $15 million. The new investments are a combination of purchases of new common stock and the conversion of existing debt to convertible stock. About half the new investments have been made, and about half are commitments for future investment.
Kior says it can convert wood chips and agricultural waste into oil products identical to those based on crude oil. Other companies are trying to use similar technology to produce cellulosic ethanol .
A year ago, Kior said it expected to produce 13 million gallons of motor fuel this year, but Cannon said in an interview Sunday that he expects production to total just 1  million to 2 million gallons. A group of investors has filed a lawsuit against the company, accusing it of misrepresentation.
Khosla asserted that the delays were not worrisome and not unusual for a first-of-a-kind construction project.
Kior’s stock peaked at more than $20 a share in September 2011 but tumbled to less than $1.50 a share this year. On Friday, before the announcement of the new financing, Kior’s shares jumped 13 percent to $2.60 a share. By 11 a.m. Monday morning, the stock had dropped 3.1 percent to $2.52 a share.

PM Narendra Modi bats for SMART policingAfter Christmas in school holiday row, Narendra Modi govt backtracks
Pitching for ‘SMART’ policing, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said intelligence gathering is the most vital aspect of the security essentials of the country which must honour its police martyrs and ensure welfare of police personnel.
The Prime Minister stressed that security of the nation does not depend on arms but on intelligence gathering.
Quoting Chanakya, the Prime Minister said, “Security of a nation does not depend on arms, how much arms are there or on the number of people using them. But depends more on intelligence gathering”.
“If intellegence gathering is strong than arms, armed men and use of arms do not become primary.Intelligence gathering is the most vital aspect of the security essentials. The nation which has the best intelligence is the strongest”, Modi said at the 49th annual conference of DGPs hosted by the Intelligence Bureau.
The Prime Minister said he wanted a force which takes care of the country’s law and order in an efficient manner.
“By ‘SMART’ policing, I mean S for strict but sensitive, M for modern and mobile, A for alert and accountable, R for reliable and responsive and T for techno-savvy and trained”, Modi said.
The police force should inculcate these values to ensure best policing which will go a long way in bringing about a new awakening and consciousness, improve its image and work culture, he said.
The Prime Minister also highlighted the need to honour the 33,000 police personnel martyred in the country after Independence as “this was not a small thing.They sacrificed for the country and the citizens security and peace. Their sacrifice while on duty should not go unrecognised”.
“The question of citizens knowing the police men’s sacrifice does not arise.The police itself does not know who these martyrs are”, Modi pointed out.
A task force has to be formed for a protocol to ensure that the force takes full responsibility of conducting last rites of martyrs with full honour as “they had died on duty for the safety and security of the common man”, the Prime Minister said.
“Besides, each state has a police academy where recruits are trained and in their syllabus it should be mandatory to include a book on the life of those police men killed on duty in their state and the courage they showed. This will inspire them”, Modi said.
“There should be a new official government book where the new generation of police will have to study about these martyrs–their lives and sacrifice and every year a new updated edition should be brought out”, he said.
The Prime Minister also called for bringing out an e- book in every state on these martyrs in the state language as well as the national languages and “this may seem to be a small gesture but will be an immense inspiration”.
Pointing out that many of the state police departments have annual cultural programmes, particularly Mumbai Police with the participation of film personalities, Modi asked them to “bring out a souvenir on the life story of the sacrifices of the police personnel of that state.They should never die whether or not they exist bodily”.
Underscoring the importance on police welfare, he said, “Policemen’s life is full of tension as they put their life at risk. Unless we ensure that there is peace and stability in their family, they cannot give their full to society and do their duty properly”.
“It is the responsibility of the government to set up a systematic programme to ensure certain welfare schemes to ease their lives like health checkup, their children’s education and their housing, particularly for those at the lower level”, he said.
“Our priority should be to bring change in a scientific manner”, he said.

Assam CM Tarun Gogoi urges PM Narendra Modi to take up issue of  China dams on BrahmaputraBy: Press Trust of India | Guwahati |
Posted: November 30, 2014 6:43 pm | Updated: November 30, 2014 6:46 pm
Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi on Sunday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to raise with Beijing the reported construction of dams on Brahmaputra by China.
“It is learnt that China is constructing some dams on the Brahmaputra river in the portion flowing through Tibet. This has created many apprehensions in the minds of the people. We urge that the matter be taken up with the Government of China to ensure that the flow of water in the river Brahmaputra is not altered in any manner detrimental to Assam,” Gogoi said in a memorandum submitted to Modi who concluded his two-day visit to Assam on Sunday.
The memorandum also cited the perennial flood problem of Assam and sought Central assistance in dealing with it.
“There is a requirement of Rs 6,700 crore for strengthening of embankments and other protection measures, which will help us cope better with recurring floods in the long term. It is worth mentioning in this connection that all the embankments constructed immediately after great earthquake of 1950 have outlived their design life and need immediate strengthening,” it added.
Gogoi also urged the Prime Minister for inclusion of erosion in the list of disasters under the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF).
Regarding security and law and order issue, the state government put forward a number of suggestions like having specialised equipment and infrastructure for riverine battalion and police stations, upgrading the police training school in Assam to an academy and modernisation of the force.
The Chief Minister also urged Modi for inclusion of Guwahati, Golaghat, Silchar, Jorhat, Tezpur, Tinsukia, Barpeta and Bongaigaon in the ‘Smart City’ scheme so that its benefits are available to these cities.

Hong Kong police clash with protesters outside government headquarters

Hong Kongers
(China says candidates for…)
HONG KONG: Hundreds of Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters faced off against police in a fresh escalation of tensions on Sunday night, as officers fired pepper spray at angry students trying to surround the government headquarters.
In chaotic scenes, protesters wearing helmets and wielding umbrellas attempted to breach the police cordon guarding the office of Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying , during a rally at the main Admiralty protest site.
"I want true democracy!" protesters yelled at police who used loudspeakers to order them them to disperse.
"Surround the headquarters. Paralyse the government." Apart from those on the front lines, several thousand people filled Tamar Park near the legislative complex.
Overall numbers have dwindled since the mass protests started two months ago, calling for free leadership elections in 2017 in the semi-autonomous Chinese city.
Protesters have become increasingly frustrated as China refuses to budge on its electoral plans for the city, and public support wanes for the occupation of major roads in different locations.
Organisers called Sunday's rally after police last week cleared one of the protest sites in the Mongkok district, making more than 100 arrests.
Protesters Sunday stormed past police lines to occupy Lung Wo road, a main traffic artery connecting the east and west of Hong Kong island.
China says candidates for the 2017 election must be vetted by a loyalist committee, which demonstrators say will result in the election of a pro-Beijing stooge.
But protesters have also expressed anger over the government's perceived cosy relationship with Hong Kong's powerful tycoons.
Leung admitted on Saturday that frustration among young people over a lack of "upward mobility" was fuelling the protests.
His comments to a government committee meeting on poverty came weeks after he shocked ordinary Hong Kongers by saying open elections were not feasible because they would result in the poor dominating politics.
The city's leader is currently selected by a 1,200-strong pro-Beijing committee stacked with elites from different business sectors.

Modi govt backtracks on BJP s Netaji demandAfter Christmas in school holiday row, Narendra Modi govt backtracks
The BJP-led government has refused to make public nearly 39 classified files on the mysterious disappearance of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and related matters, in sharp contrast to the demands of disclosure raised by its senior leaders when in Opposition.
In January when the Lok Sabha election campaign was at its peak, the then BJP president Rajnath Singh, during a visit to Cuttack – the birthplace of Netaji – on the occasion of his 117th birth anniversary, had demanded that the UPA government make public the records related to the freedom fighter.
Singh is now the Home Minister.
The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) in a recent RTI reply accepted that there were 41 files related to Bose, of which two had been declassified, but refused to disclose them taking a position similar to that of the erstwhile Congress-led UPA government.
“Disclosure of documents contained in these files would prejudicially affect relations with foreign countries. As such, these files are exempted from disclosure under Section 8(1)(a) read with Section 8(2) of the Right to Information Act,” the PMO said in its reply to RTI activist Subhash Agrawal.
Singh had claimed during the election campaign that there was larger public interest in the disclosure of the documents, but the PMO under Modi seems not to be in agreement as is evident from the reply which considered the larger public interest disclosure clause – section 8(2) – of the RTI Act but chose to withhold the documents.
The section 8(2) says, “Notwithstanding anything in the Official Secrets Act, 1923 nor any of the exemptions permissible in accordance with sub-section(1), a public authority may allow access to information, if public interest in disclosure outweighs the harm to the protected interests.”
“The entire country is impatient to know as to how Netaji died and under what circumstances,” Singh had said, releasing a book on the eve of Netaji’s birth anniversary in Cuttack on January 22.
The PMO said in its reply, “Yes this office has some files related to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. A list of files unclassified/classified/declassified with number and subject matter relating to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose is enclosed.”
The PMO gave a list of 41 files of which two related to INA treasure and appointment of a inquiry commission to go into circumstances of death have been declassified and sent to the National Archives of India.
The office, in its response, admitted that there are 10 files which are unclassified but still invoked exemption clause of section 8(1) to withhold them from disclosure.
Four ‘Top Secret’ files which are held by the PMO include miscellaneous correspondence with and about widow and daughter of Netaji, transfer of his ashes to India and two files on the Justice Mukherjee Commission of Inquiry looking into his death/disappearance, it said.
There are 20 files classified as ‘Secret’ including one related to acquisition of Jankinath Bhavan – birth place of Netaji – by then Orissa government, five files of late sixties on the appointment of inquiry committee to go into the circumstances of “death” of Netaji, correspondence with and about his wife and daughter, another inquiry commission to look into treasure of INA, two references from Samar Guha, MP on his disappearance, Bharat Ratna award to Netaji and number of files on his death/disappearance among others.
The rest of the files are categorised as ‘Classified’ which include issues related to mortal remains kept in Rankoji temple in Japan while on the rest no particular subject is mentioned.
Commenting on the development, RTI applicant Agrawal said, “Public interest definitely overweighs the protected as several commissions/committees have been formed by the Union government to probe mystery in death of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose.”
“The CPIO (Central Public Information Officer) did not even specify name of the country with which relations are likely to be prejudicially affected,” he said.

Islamic State made Mumbai  jihadist  Areeb Majeed clean toiletsAfter Christmas in school holiday row, Narendra Modi govt backtracks
Areeb Majeed, suspected member of terror outfit Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), has revealed the names of the local contacts, who allegedly provided him the logistics to join the group to take part in the battle in Iraq, NIA officials said today.
Majeed also disclosed how he was completely sidelined by the terror group as he had been asked to carry out menial tasks like cleaning toilets or providing water to those on the battlefield, instead of being pushed into the warzone.
“Majeed was today grilled for several hours when he revealed the names of the local contacts, who radicalized him and his three other friends here, and helped them fly to Iraq. We are verifying his claims and are trying to locate these local contacts,” a National Investigation Agency official said.
However, the officer refused to divulge the names of the local supporters here saying it would derail the probe.
Asked for how many months he participated in the battle on the ground, the 23-year-old ISIS ‘recruit’ said he was completely ignored and asked to clean the toilets and arrange water for those battling with the security forces.
He told the investigators that despite his immediate supervisor’s request, the ISIS cadres did not allow him to participate in the battle.
His resolve to take part in the war weakened after he was left unattended for his bullet injury for three days before being taken to a hospital, he told them.
“Only after I begged them, I was taken to a hospital. I was treating myself, but the injury was worsening as there was no proper medication or food available in the camps,” Majeed told investigators.
“There was neither a holy war nor any of the preachings in the holy book were followed. ISIS fighters raped many a woman there,” Majeed said while responding to one of the questions, an NIA official said.
Admitting that he and his three friends from Kalyan underwent training on handling of sophisticated AK 47 and rocket launchers, Majeed claimed the Indians were considered to be physically weak.
Majeed was arrested on Friday on his return to Mumbai after spending nearly six months in Iraq. He was booked under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) on charges of conspiring to commit a terrorist act and being a member of a banned foreign terror outfit, and under the stringent Section 125 of the IPC for “waging war against the nation”.
In May this year, four youths from Kalyan town — Majeed, Shaheen Tanki, Fahad Shaikh and Aman Tandel — had left India to visit holy places in West Asia, but disappeared thereafter. They were suspected to have joined the ISIS.
According to police, the four engineering students flew to Baghdad on May 23 as part of a group of 22 pilgrims to visit religious shrines in Iraq.
The next day, Majeed had called his family from Baghdad and apologised for having left without informing them. Upon returning to India, other pilgrims had told the police that, Majeed, Fahad, Aman and Saheen had hired a taxi to Fallujah, a city west of Baghdad, which had emerged as the epicentre of Iraq’s deadly insurgency.
On August 26, Tanki called up Majeed’s family and told them that their son had become a “martyr” claiming that the latter died fighting for ISIS in Syria.
Accordingly, the next day, Areeb Majeed’s family performed ‘Janaza-e-gayabana’ (prayers for the departed soul in the absence of the body) in Kalyan.

In fading Japan hinterland, sceptics doubt "Abenomics" will cure ills
Reuters Dec 1, 2014, 03.33AM IST

Abenomics
(Critics say Abe's policies…)
AKITA CITY: Mihoko Asaka wants to know how candidates in this month's election in Japan will create jobs and halt the drastic population decline that is bleeding her home region of youth and vitality, but has little hope they will offer real solutions.
Like many of his age group, her 25-year-old son left the largely rural prefecture of Akita in northeastern Japan to find work after graduating from college.
"I'm interested to see how much they are listening to the voices from this region," said Asaka, 57, waiting for a bus in Akita City, the prefecture's capital. "But I don't think our voices are being heard. They talk about money being thrown around, but we can't see where it goes."
Critics say Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's policies to end deflation and generate growth have helped mainly big cities, large companies and the rich by boosting share prices and exporters' profits with a hyper-easy monetary policy that has slashed the value of the yen and sent asset prices higher.
All too aware of the criticism, Abe has made spreading the benefits of his "Abenomics" agenda to "every nook and cranny" of Japan a key plank of his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) platform for the Dec. 14 lower house election.
The LDP-led ruling coalition is expected to keep its lower house majority, so interest is focused on whether and to what extent its grip on two-thirds of the chamber erodes.
Akita prefecture, with the dubious distinction of having Japan's highest suicide rate and fastest-shrinking population, definitely needs a boost.
Already, about 30 per cent of its population is aged 65 and over compared to 25 per cent nationwide, with the ratio predicted to rise to more than 40 per cent by 2040, when Akita's total population will have fallen by more than a third to 700,000.
The prefecture has had scant success attracting new businesses. Average annual wages ranked 45th out of 47 prefectures in 2013, while Akita's minimum wage of 679 yen ($6) per hour lags far behind Tokyo's 888 yen.
"Abenomics isn't helping Akita," said a 65-year-old former banker who declined to give his name. "It just keeps sinking."
A LITTLE LIGHT?
Some local executives argue Abenomics is working, at least by beginning to alter the deflationary mindset that has kept Japanese companies in downsizing mode for two decades.
Akita's jobs-applicants ratio hit 0.93 in October, still way below Tokyo's 1.59 but a 22-year high for the prefecture.
"Before, things were completely dark. Now we can see a little light," Hiroki Miura, chairman of the Akita Chamber of Commerce and Industry, told Reuters, adding that sharp cuts in public works spending by the previous Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) government had hit the local economy hard.
Some business leaders had hoped Abe's plan to legalise casinos could be a boost for the region but the outlook is murky after legislation died in parliament due to the election.
  Florist Masanori Sato, head of a local shopowners association, said he'd felt a gradual improvement in business until a sales tax rise to 8 per cent took effect in April. Abe has postponed a second sales tax hike to 10 per cent for 18 months from a planned October 2015 start.
"So far, Abenomics has mostly helped the centre, but I feel as if it will start to spread after a while," he said in his tiny flower shop filled with Christmas decorations.
Like elsewhere in Japan, however, Akita wage increases have not kept pace with rising prices, and union officials said many of the new jobs on offer are for lower-paid temporary workers.
The LDP is traditionally strong in the region, but Abe's decision to call a snap poll after just two years in office is making it hard for the LDP to generate enthusiasm. Voter turnout could mark another record low, in Akita as well as nationwide.
NO WINDS BLOWING
"Last time, the wind blowing against the DPJ was very strong," said Yoichi Suzuki, vice-chairman of the LDP's Akita urban branch, referring to a voter backlash in 2012 against the then-ruling Democrats sometimes chaotic 2009-2012 reign.
"This time ... there is no wind at all."
As elsewhere, voter disaffection could help the LDP, since it can still mobilise core supporters, although local politicians said LDP-friendly farmers are upset over falling rice prices and could turn to a rival conservative candidate in one of the prefecture's three election districts.
Civil servant Mihoko Iwasawa, 55, doesn't plan to vote.
"I'll just keep quiet and hope the LDP wins," she said, chatting with a former classmate in a coffee shop.
While anti-Democrat anger may have waned a bit, it has far from evaporated.
"It's impossible to suddenly restore our image in this election," DPJ candidate Manabu Terata told Reuters. A 38-year-old former aide to DPJ premier Naoto Kan, Terata is bidding to regain his lower house seat.
Housewife Fumiko, 66, voted for the DPJ in 2009 but didn't cast a ballot three years later.
This time, she has yet to make up her mind. "There are a lot of people who can't vote for any party with confidence," she said, declining to give her family name. "I'm one of them."

NEW DELHI: Domino's, the world's largest pizza delivery chain, sells more pizzas in India than anywhere else outside its home country — the US.
Domino's Pizza India, run by the Bhartia family-promoted Jubilant FoodWorks , now makes and sells four lakh pizzas every day, or more than 12 crore pizzas a year — about twice the number of burgers McDonald's sells in India.
This month Domino's India overtook its UK counterpart in store count to become the largest international market for the company outside the US. As of November 29, there are 818 Domino's Pizza restaurants in India across 173 cities.
"India is the only country where we are double the size of McDonald's," said Ajay Kaul, CEO, Jubilant FoodWorks.
And he still sees huge scope for growth. "We believe we are scratching the surface... over 15 million people are consuming us every year, but half of those consumers are consuming us only once a year," Kaul said.
It's this opportunity that has persuaded Domino's, with global retail sales of $8 billion, to expand its reach in the Indian market aggressively despite the slowdown in the quick service sector with people checking their discretionary spending. In second quarter, Jubilant FoodWorks' same-store sales growth slowed to 5.3 per cent compared with 6.6 per cent a year earlier.
The company, which also operates the Dunkin' Donuts chain in the country, reported a 12.7 per cent year-on-year drop in its standalone net profit for the second quarter at Rs 29 crore as it spent big on opening new stores.
It plans to continue expanding its reach at a fast clip. Kaul said Domino's is looking to set up 150 new stores every year and hopes to touch 1,500 to 2,000 stores by 2020. He said people like eating pizza in smaller markets such as Patna, Salem and Kanpur as much as they do Delhi or Mumbai.
India got to second rank in the Domino's universe within 18 years. However, India is a distant No. 2 to the US, where Domino's operates more than 5,000 stores.
Patrick Doyle, global president and CEO at Domino's Pizza, said he was not surprised by the India success because of the quality of people the company has.
"India now has more stores than any market outside of the US. Clearly, it is a major priority for us and will continue to be," he told ET in an email. So why have Indians taken to pizza in such a big way? Kaul said it's quite simple — cultural affinity.
"Pizzas resonate with Indian consumption habits as they look like chapatis, have a wheat base, are eaten with hands instead of forks and spoons, and the same pizza is often shared by slices and has either vegetables or chicken toppings," he explained.
Then there's the seemingly infinite variety afforded by the mix-and-match aspect of toppings. "We Indians like combinations and variety in our food and a pizza allows all of that, unlike a burger or any other global food product," said Santosh Desai, social commentator and MD and CEO of Future Brands . Another big factor is the price. At the entry level rate of 49, Domino's pizzas in India are also the lowest priced in the world.
As it steps up store count, Domino's is shrinking coverage areas — so that it can continue to deliver pizzas within 30 minutes. Its delivery bikes, sourced from Hero, come fitted with speed governors that prevent the drivers from going too fast. "We call our delivery men 'safe delivery persons' and (still) try to ensure that the average delivery time is 22 minutes," Kaul said.

Father of eight wants his children to workBy Jonnelle Marte October 28 Follow @jonnelle

David T. Fagan has eight kids and his oldest daughter is a senior in high school–and he hasn’t saved a penny for his children’s college education. But Fagan isn’t stressing. In fact, Fagan says he would prefer it if his children didn’t go to college at all.
Fagan and his wife lay out their parenting philosophy in new book Guerrilla Parenting , scheduled to be released in January, and say they encourage their children to strike out on their own and create businesses from the time they’re in elementary school. If the children are set on going to college — and their oldest is– Fagan says he expects his children to work, save up and earn scholarships. Or at the very least, they need to make a good case for how they’re going to use the degree to land a job and avoid ending up back on his couch.
Fagan, a marketing executive who lives in Orange County, Calif. with his wife, kids and two dogs, recently spoke with The Washington Post about the pros and cons of a college education and how he and his wife start teaching their children about money from the moment they start walking.
The conversation below has been edited for length and clarity.
Tell me about your family.
I’m the oldest of six kids and I grew up in a home where if I wanted anything my parents told me hey you have to go work for it. I actually left high school in 11th grade. Later on I did do a little bit of college, but never graduated. That carried over to when I had kids. You know, wanting them to have a customized education. Not so much about college and degrees. I think there’s a lot of wasted time there.
I think there’s are a lot of people out there who are not cut out for college. I’m raising my kids knowing that each one of them is different and that each one of them needs a little bit of an experience. A lot of my kids, they go to public school but I’ve taken my kids out of school before.
They’ve been home schooled at different times but for the most part they’re all in public schools. My oldest is 17, my youngest is two. It makes things interesting to say the least.

When you decided to leave school, was it because you wanted to start working?
I was just very independent and that’s maybe one of the downsides of having too much independence. Because my parents always had me do so much things and make money, by the time I was in 11th grade, I was bored. I wanted to experience things. I wanted to work and make money and be on my own.
I think I made my life harder than it needed to be at that age but out of that came me learning what my strengths were and learning what my weaknesses were and learning how to make money. I didn’t have a college education and I also looked really young so I had to learn how to communicate with people.
I moved from a small town in Oregon to California. I sold an electronics company into hiring me to sell electronics. Cell phones were just starting to get big and computers were also starting to get big so I sold computers. They usually didn’t hire people till they turned 18. I was 17 so I had to sell them on that.
I wanted to work, I wanted to make money. I wanted to be independent. I wanted to go out and do things.  But I think that’s kind of part of the problem and where a lot of teens fall short today. They’re starting to have their own dreams and ideas and instead of those things being fostered and experimented with, they’re being squashed and thrown to the side.
And unfortunately by the time they’re given that chance they have responsibilities and they have issues and they have other things going on. They have good habits and they have bad habits. All of a sudden life gets in the way and now it’s really hard. So I think early on they really need to experiment and to try things.
Are you trying to say that an education is important but if you don’t have an experience or a good work ethic, an education won’t go as far?
Mark Twain had a famous quote, “I have never let schooling interfere with my education.” And I just love that quote because it’s so true. There’s just so many things that can’t be done in the classroom. There’s so many things about the school system that are broken. That’s not news to anybody it’s just nobody’s brave enough to do something different.
So, what I’ve done with my own kids is my oldest was in first and second grade and I pulled her out of school because she just wasn’t doing very well and the teacher didn’t know what to do. So I brought her to the office with me. I gave her things to do.
Then she went back into school all the way back until the 7th grade and then in the 7th grade she was starting to do some different business stuff that I was helping her with, and other parents were saying, “Hey, how does your daughter do this or how does this work? And how does she earn all this money?” So I pulled her back out of school and started taking her on the road. I do a lot of speaking and presenting so I started taking her to conventions with me and I actually put her on stage. And I was like, “Hey you potential entrepreneurs out there, if I can teach a 12 year old girl how to do this you can do this. If I can teach a 12-year-old to start a business, you can start a business.”
So I helped her write a book and do some other things and gave her a lot of real world experience. But then in the 8th grade she went back to school and she probably had seen a little too much of the real world at a young age. Then her sophomore year we took her out of school again because she was having so many opportunities.
So she did a huge internship program with my office in Beverly Hills, and she did more traveling and she started a business called hireateentoday.com, which is a virtual assistant company made out of teenagers. Then in the 11th grade she wanted to date, she wanted to spend time with her friends.
She just wanted to be young. So she went back to school in the 11th grade and now she’s just getting ready to start the 12th grade and graduate and figure out what she wants to do next.
So much is customizing things. I think I do have some advantages that some parents don’t because I do have the ability to teach, I do have the ability to put them in different environments. But I think that’s stuff that other people can do too and that’s what we want to teach them too through this Guerrilla Parenting book.
How can children start making money when they’re young?
I’m big on teaching power plays. A power play to me is something you can do really quickly that will make you money. I’m always teaching people about proof of concept– getting things to market quickly.
One of the things my daughter, who just turned 13, will do to get money, she’ll go into an office complex and she’ll say, “I’m bringing in enchiladas tomorrow. Who wants some?” In an afternoon, she’ll sell 30 to 40 products.
She’ll do that in 24 hours and she’ll make herself a couple hundred bucks. She’s really good at sales, and that’s what I’m seeing specifically the potential in her. School is not going to teach her what I think she needs to learn next to develop those talents so I want to help her do that.
Related: How to pass money on to your children
How early do you start teaching your kids about the concept of money and how it’s made?
Very early. But it’s not so much about just money. It’s really a mindset. And I find the mindset is really about teaching kids if you want something, figure it out and then show them how to get it. So the mindset starts at a year-and a half, two years old.
If I’m at a store or if we’re at a restaurant, I’ll ask them, “What do you want?” And they’ll say, “I want to order this.” “Well you tell the waitress, you tell the person at the counter.” And that may sound really silly but some kids are really shy. And if my kids won’t ask for it, they won’t get it. So just getting them in the mindset of what do you want and what are you willing to do to get it, even if maybe it makes you feel a little uncomfortable.
That is the biggest problem with our society right now. You very rarely see two or three generations of success in a row because that one person gets the success and what do they say? They say, “I never want my kid to go through what I went through.” When what they went through was exactly what made them a success.

So what do they do? “I’m going to send you to the best school. I’m going to send you to the best college. I’m going to give you this, I’m going to give you that. I’m going to give you all the things I never had” –without them ever having to work for it. And so by giving them things they’re kind of condemning them to a life of mediocrity.
That’s what I’m trying to show people. Help your kids figure out what they want and then make them do their part to get it.
Walk me through the rules of the house. If one of your kids wants to go to college, who pays for it?
My kids all know that if they want to go to college they’ve got to pay for it. They also know I’m a deal maker and negotiator and when the time comes they can pitch me whatever they want to pitch me. But the rules are I’m not paying for anybody’s college. I might pay for an individual class that they might sell me on or whatever. But I’m just not a believer.
You can ask anyone of my kids. “Is your dad going to pay for college? No.”
So what are you going to do? You’d better get a scholarship, you’d better get good grades. I think we’re putting the emphasis on the wrong thing. The emphasis is on “you’ve got to go to college.” The emphasis should be on, “You’ve got to become self-reliant. You’ve got to take care of yourself.”
I use this one Venn Diagram a lot where three circles all overlap in the middle. One circle is everything you love to do. Make another list of everything you know how to do what you’re good at doing. And then the other circle is, what are the things people will pay you to do? And where that overlaps in the middle. that’s the sweet spot. That’s where total success is at.
So I’m more concerned with the journey of helping my kids figure out what that looks like. What do they love, what are they good at, and who will pay them the most money for those things?
College might help you learn what you love, college might help you learn all three of those areas. But it’s a method. It’s a process. It’s a tool, it’s a resource. It’s not the destination. Too many people go to college as if that is the finish line. And that’s why you see all these people sleeping on their parents’ couches.
Related: How much do you need to make to afford your student loans?
I have friends who are attorneys and things like that they basically say “David I was just told that when I graduated I would turn into money, I would be instantly rich. But you know, here I am now. I’m an attorney, and there’s a ton of attorneys and now I have to learn business.” So all the focus is on the wrong thing.
So many groups are trying to raise awareness to the fact that an education alone does not lead to success and many employers emphasize work experience. But the numbers still show that the people who have college degrees earn more on average than people who don’t. So how do you balance that?
Ask yourself this: Who are the people who make the most money overall? What are the careers? Sales people. Entrepreneurs. Maybe only 10 percent to 20 percent of those sales people or entrepreneurs are really doing well but that 10 to 20 percent of those people are drastically slanting the numbers against anything else. And I would even go as far as saying that again, are we asking the right question? You’re saying, “who is making the most money?” But money doesn’t equal happiness.
People aren’t defining happiness by the second home, the boat, the fancy corner office. The fancy title. More and more people are starting to value experiences and stability to make a decent living. To have friends. To travel, to have a hobby. To be able to have a vacation, to be able to have a balanced life. We don’t care so much about the savings account, which maybe is a problem that is going to come back to bite us. But we want to enjoy life now. We don’t want to put off our dreams till later because we don’t know if there’s going to be a tomorrow. There used to be more stability in the marketplace.
It used to be “I’m going to go to get a college education and go work for a company because it’s more stable.” But it’s not anymore. Companies are going out of business all the time. Companies merge all the time. Companies are sending jobs overseas all the time.
It may still be that college kids and corporations are the safer thing but that’s changing. It’s changing fast. I think it’s going to keep changing so if you want happiness and self-reliance then learn how to monetize your knowledge and your experiences and learn how to live a life by your own design.
So if your children do decide they do want to save money to go to college, how are you advising them to do that?
My second oldest daughter Taylor, who is 15, is perfect for college. She is saving a little bit. She’s a 4.0 student. She’s won awards for being a student athlete. I believe that she is one of those people that she is designed for school. She should go to college. She probably will become an attorney or something like that. But even then I’m going to say “okay now you have a law degree, open up your own practice but don’t go to work for someone else. Or go work for someone else for a while and then open up your own practice so you can be in control of your own destiny.”
But I wouldn’t be surprised if she graduated high school, went to college, got married, had kids. Maybe did something else on the side. But lived life totally happy, totally content and totally by design even though education played a big role in it.

Five things to know about Alibabas leadershipBy Jena McGregor September 18 Follow @jenamcgregor
Jack Ma, chairman of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., speaks at a company event in Beijing, China, on Wednesday, Jan. 19, 2011. Photographer: Nelson Ching/Bloomberg
On Friday morning, Jack Ma , the charismatic and already super-wealthy  founder of  Alibaba Group , is expected to ring the bell of the New York Stock Exchange. It will mark the much-anticipated  debut of shares of the Chinese company, and could become the world's largest initial public offering ever . Here are some key points you should know about the people leading this e-commerce giant:
1. Jack Ma is not actually the CEO.
The name behind this massive stock offering may be the founder and the company's face — and a very visible one at that — but he's not technically the CEO. Ma stepped down  as chief executive in January 2013, and a few months later  Jonathan Lu took the CEO title.
Lu, whose first job after college was at the reception desk of a Holiday Inn in China, has been described as Ma's "corporate alter-ego." He's a sort of Tim Cook to Jack Ma's Steve Jobs — the soft-spoken, behind-the-scenes operator who focuses on the company's current needs while Ma, now executive chairman, is the visionary. Still, as a recent New York Times  profile reminded us, Ma continues to act not only as the public face but as the chief negotiator, the top strategist and the biggest individual shareholder who remains very much in control.
Another behind-the-scenes person of note: Simon Xie, a co-founder and vice president, is the only person   besides Ma  who owns the " variable-interest entities " that hold the operating licenses to various Web sites that are critical to Alibaba's business. According to Reuters , the unassuming Xie helps run Alibaba's investment division and is not a member of the 30-person steering committee that manages the company (see below), but he is still "one of Ma's most trusted business partners."
2. Its governance structure is novel, and possibly unprecedented, for a company of this size.
Alibaba Group has an unorthodox approach to governing itself. In  filings , it writes that the company has acted like a partnership in many ways since its founders first got together in Jack Ma's apartment in 1999. As a result, in 2010 it established the "Alibaba Partnership," a now 30-member steering committee made up of managers at Alibaba Group and related companies. Alibaba says this arrangement allows executives to focus on the long-term, collaborate better and "override bureaucracy and hierarchy."
In filings, the company also noted it sees this as a better alternative to dual-class share structures , which have been used in other tech giants . In those, votes by shareholders (often founders) who own a certain class of stock carry a disproportionate weight. Alibaba has argued  its structure "is designed to embody the vision of a large group of management partners. This structure is our solution for preserving the culture shaped by our founders while at the same time accounting for the fact that founders will inevitably retire from the company."
Yet while those Alibaba managers in the partnership don't have outsized votes, they do have a very special privilege: They get to nominate  a majority of the company's governing body, its board of directors.
That means, in effect, they have the power to choose whom they answer to. "You're basically ceding control to management," says Charles Elson , the director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. "It's very unusual. I've never seen anything like it for a company of this size."
3. That — plus Ma's comment that "shareholders come third" — could be a concern for some investors. 
Since insiders have so much control over the board, some governance experts wonder what that means for the board's independence and efficacy. Harvard Law School's Lucian Bebchuk, for example, detailed his concerns in a recent New York Times piece . While that risk doesn't seem to be keeping many people away from the huge stock offering, some investors have called it out as a warning sign .
Less worrisome is the comment in Ma's letter to shareholders that Alibaba "will put 'customers first, employees second, and shareholders third.'” Plenty of other business leaders  have used similar phrasing , and what he appears to mean is that he intends to focus on the long term rather than give in to short-term whims of shareholders that might arise. Without offering something that's first and foremost valuable to customers, and ensuring the company has happy, talented and focused employees to support that work, "we could not possibly have satisfied shareholders," Ma writes.
4. The gender diversity of its management team is better than that of some big companies in Silicon Valley. But on the board, it's lacking.
Nine of the 30 members of the Alibaba Partnership, or nearly 30 percent, are women. And three of the 12 executives it lists on its  Web site  as leaders of the company are as well. That's higher  than the 21 percent of Google's leaders who are women and the 21 percent at Twitter . (The 28 percent at eBay and  Apple  are more in line.) Alibaba Group's chief financial officer, head of human resources, and "chief customer officer" are all women.
Yet the gender makeup of its board leaves something to be desired. The lone female on the nine-member board  is Yahoo's chief development officer,  Jacqueline Reses  — and she is expected to step down once the IPO is completed.
5. The annual shareholder letter won't always come from Ma, or the CEO.
That may sound like a trivial thing, but it's not. Annual shareholder letters from big-name companies, such as  Warren Buffett 's at Berkshire Hathaway or the one written by Amazon's  Jeff Bezos  (who also owns the Washington Post), are widely studied by investors. They offer shareholders a sense of the big-picture strategy, some insights on how management thinks, and the key priorities for the company. Yet Ma has written that, after the IPO, his "partners in the Alibaba Partnership will take turns writing the annual letter." That's a very unusual practice — just like plenty of other things about this huge company that's about to go public.

It will fly like a missile if the take off happens.The days are not far as it has consolidated nearly a month. Fingers crossed.. :-) ..

(They are pouring funds into…)
NEW DELHI: Overseas investors have poured in over $ 4 billion in the Indian capital markets this month taking total inflows to over $ 40 billion since January.
The net investment by foreign investors into equities was Rs 13,753 crore ($ 2.23 billion) last month, while they infused Rs 11,723 crore ($ 1.9 billion) in the debt market , taking the total to $ 4.1 billion, as per latest data.
The net infusion in October was $ 2.8 billion. Market analysts maintain that Foreign Portfolio Investors have been betting on the Indian market mainly on account of the reforms agenda of the new government at the Centre.
They are pouring funds into Indian markets on the hopes of speedy economic growth and cut in interest rates as oil prices have dropped and inflation has declined.
Moreover, foreign investors are pumping funds into debt in order to take advantage of the higher yields.
The net investment by overseas investors into the equity market has reached Rs 96,020 crore ($ 16 billion) so far this year, while in the debt markets it is at Rs 1.48 lakh crore ($ 24.4 billion), taking the total to Rs 2.44 lakh crore ($ 40.36 billion).
The strong inflows have helped push the BSE index Sensex by about 36 per cent so far this year.
Since the beginning of June, Foreign Institutional Investors ( FIIs ) along with sub-accounts and qualified foreign investors have been clubbed together by market regulator Sebi to create a new investor category called Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs).

Islamic State jihadists suffer heavy losses in Syria's Kobane

(At least 50 jihadists were…)
BEIRUT: Islamic State group jihadists battling for control of the Syrian town of Kobane have suffered some of their heaviest losses yet in 24 hours of clashes and US-led air strikes.
At least 50 jihadists were killed in the embattled border town in suicide bombings, clashes with Kobane's Kurdish defenders and the air strikes, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Sunday.
The Britain-based monitor also reported that the US-led coalition battling the IS group hit at least 30 targets in and around Raqa, the jihadists' de facto capital.
There were no immediate details of a toll in the Raqa strikes, which the Observatory called one of the larger waves of raids by the coalition since it began its campaign in Syria in September.
In southern Daraa province, regime strikes killed at least 19 civilians, among them seven women and two children.
The deaths in Kobane came on Saturday after IS jihadists launched an unprecedented attack against the border crossing separating the Syrian Kurdish town from Turkey.
Kurdish officials and the Observatory alleged the attack was launched from Turkish soil, a claim dismissed by the Turkish army as "lies".
IS began advancing on Kobane on September 16, hoping to quickly seize the small border town and secure its grip on a large stretch of the Syrian-Turkish border, following advances it made in Iraq.
At one point it looked set to overrun the town, but Kurdish Syrian fighters, backed by coalition air strikes and an influx of Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga forces, have held back the group.
In Raqa province, the coalition carried out strikes against at least 30 IS targets on the northern outskirts of Raqa city and struck Division 17, a Syrian army base jihadists captured earlier this year.
Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said the strikes had caused casualties, but there was no immediate toll available.
"We can't say it's the largest set of raids they have carried out, but it's been a long time since we've seen this number of targets hit," he said.
The coalition began carrying out air strikes against the Islamic State group on September 23, and stepped up raids in Kobane in a bid to prevent it falling to IS.
On Thursday, the coordinator of the coalition said at least 600 IS fighters had been killed in air strikes and that the group had made easy targets of its fighters by pouring them into Kobane.
"ISIL has in so many ways impaled itself on Kobane," said retired US general John Allen, using a variant of the name for IS.
  But Syria's Foreign Minister Walid Muallem, speaking from Russia after meeting key regime ally President Vladimir Putin, said the air strikes were having little effect.
"Is Daesh weaker today after two months of coalition strikes? All the indicators show that it is not," he told the pan-Arab Al-Mayadeen news channel.
He said unless Turkey closed its border to jihadists, the group would be unharmed by the air strikes.
Damascus has regularly accused Turkey of supporting "terrorism" because of its support for the Syrian opposition.
Turkey denies the allegations, but has made no secret of its backing for the opposition, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan calling for Syria's President Bashar al-Assad to step down.
Despite their differences, Erdogan is set to receive Putin in Ankara on Monday for talks about the conflict, which began in March 2011 and has killed nearly 200,000 people.
The regime has kept up its deadly strikes, including raids that killed 19 civilians including seven women and two children in Jassem in southern Daraa province on Sunday.
Turkey also hosted Pope Francis this week, who used his visit to urge protection of the Middle East's Christian population against threats by jihadists.
"The terrible situation of Christians and all those who are suffering in the Middle East calls not only for our constant prayer, but also for an appropriate response on the part of the international community," the Pope said in a joint statement with Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I.

("All pending projects need…)
KOLKATA: Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu today advised Metro Railway and Kolkata Metro Railway Corporation Ltd (KMRC) authorities to resolve the hurdles and accelerate the progress of their pending projects.
"All pending projects need to be expedited to prevent further escalation of project costs," Prabhu said after reviewing various project works in the state.
Incidentally, the ambitious East West Metro project of KMRC is incurring cost over-run due to delay in solving land problem in central Kolkata area.
Laying stress on efficient finance management and passenger earnings, Prabhu directed the railway officials at a high level meeting where possible steps to ensure passenger safety were discussed, a railway release said here.
The minister dwelt on the need for construction of road over-bridge and under-bridge along NH corridors as per MoU signed with the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways .
Directing the officials to give immediate response to passenger complaints, he emphasised there should be single number where passengers could lodge all sorts of complaints.
Speaking about security in railway, the minister stressed on further training to railway security personnel for passenger assistance.
Stressing on the need for better coordination between the railway and state police for investigation and curb crime, Prabhu said, "More women security personnel will be engaged for escorting trains."
According cleanliness a national priority, Prabhu said that there should be no compromise in ensuring cleanliness of trains, platforms and railway tracks.
Stating that railway was committed to serve quality food to passengers, the minister said the railways in this connection have set up mechanised base kitchens to ensure strict quality assurance.
He also discussed about the supply of low-cost purified drinking water to passengers.

WHO will miss Ebola targets it set for Decem...World Health Organization will miss Ebola targets it set for December 1

(Even if December 1 targets…)
LONDON: Two months ago, the World Health Organization launched an ambitious plan to stop the deadly Ebola outbreak in West Africa, aiming to isolate 70 percent of the sick and safely Ebola 70 per cent of the victims in the three hardest-hit countries Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone by December 1.
Only Guinea is on track to meet the December 1 goal, according to an update from WHO.
In Liberia, only 23 per cent of cases are isolated and 26 per cent of the needed burial teams are in place. In Sierra Leone, about 40 per cent of cases are isolated while 27 per cent of burial teams are operational.
With the target date looming on Monday, it looks almost certain WHO's goals will be missed, marking another failure in attempts to slow the biggest-ever outbreak of the deadly disease. The Ebola outbreak was first reported in Guinea in March and spiraled out of control after being declared a public health emergency in August.
WHO's Dr. Bruce Aylward acknowledged in October that to reach the December 1 goal would be "really pushing the system hard."
"If we don't do it in 60 days and we take 90 days: No. 1, a lot more people will die that shouldn't; and No. 2, we will need that much more capacity on the ground to be able to manage the caseload," said Aylward, who is directing WHO's Ebola response.
In recent weeks, there have been some successes in curbing Ebola; cases seem to be declining or stabilizing in Liberia and Guinea. But the area around Sierra Leone's capital and a district in the country's north are seeing a severe surge in cases.
The December 1 targets had been met in many places but not all, which was the goal, said Anthony Banbury , who is heading the UN's Ebola response.
"There are still going to be many people who catch the disease and many people who die from it," Banbury said.
Even if the December 1 targets had been reached, WHO and others had predicted Ebola would continue sickening people in West Africa and possibly elsewhere until sometime next year.
As of November 26, WHO said there were nearly 16,000 cases of Ebola and 5,600 deaths, including all confirmed, suspect and probable cases.
Failing to reach the December 1 target now suggests Ebola will spread even further as capacities to respond become even more stretched, according to Oyewale Tomori, of Redeemer's University in Nigeria, who sits on WHO's Emergency Ebola committee.
"We need to redouble our efforts to see what we can do to reduce the spread and catch up with the virus," he said. "Right now, it doesn't look good."

Imran Khan threatens to "shut down" Pakistan by December 16

December 16
(The cricketer-turned-politician…)
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's opposition leader Imran Khan today threatened to "shut down" the entire country by December 16 if the Nawaz Sharif Government failed to initiate an impartial probe into the alleged rigging in 2013 general elections.
The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chief, in a rally here outside the Parliament, said that his protest will continue till the government initiate an inquiry into the "massive rigging" in last year's general elections, which saw Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) win by a landslide.
"The ball is in your court, Nawaz Sharif -- do your talks, do your investigations and solve the issue. We will close Pakistan down when December 16 comes, and what I do after that you will not be able to bear it...It has been 109 days and Naya Pakistan is waking up every day. We can all see it," Khan was quoted as saying by Dawn.
"On Thursday (December 4), I will go to Lahore and shut it down. On December 8 I will shut down Faisalabad, on December 12 I will go to Karachi and shut it down. By December 16 I will shut down all of Pakistan if the poll inquiry is not initiated," Khan said.
The cricketer-turned-politician has been holding protest-rallies in different cities to spread his movement, demanding a probe into the allegations of rigging the election.
Khan had launched his protest in mid-August, demanding Sharif's ouster, but he later withdrew his main demand of the Prime Minister's resignation ahead of the probe and offered the government to constitute a judicial commission comprising Supreme Court judges, ISI and Military Intelligence officials, to investigate the reported rigging.
December 16 is considered as a tragic day in the history of Pakistan as the country lost its eastern wing after a war with India when its army surrendered and Bangladesh emerged as an independent country.
The PTI leader said that if his demand for the impartial inquiry of the elections was not met, he would make the functioning of government "impossible".
He alleged that the Nawaz Sahrif government is promoting corruption and politics of patronage.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister's spokesman, Mussadik Malik said that it was "unfortunate" that Khan had threatened to "shut down" the country.
"What he want to achieve through it. I urge him to leave the politics of agitation and enter into a meaningful dialogue to achieve his objectives," he said.
Minister for Railways Saad Rafiq said such announcements cannot be made by a patriotic person.
"Imran wants to spread anarchy and derail democracy in the disguise of bringing true democracy," he said.

Retail group: Black Friday weekend loses allure(Total spending for the weekend…)
NEW YORK: Black Friday fatigue is setting in.
Early discounting, more online shopping and a mixed economy meant fewer people shopped over Thanksgiving weekend, according to a survey of shoppers released Sunday by the National Retail Federation.
Overall, 133.7 million people shopped at stores and online over the four-day holiday weekend, down 5.2 per cent from last year, according to a survey of 4,631 people conducted by Prosper Insights & Analytics for the trade group.
Total spending for the weekend is expected to fall 11 per cent to $50.9 billion from an estimated $57.4 billion last year. Shoppers, on average, are expected to spend $380.95 over the four days, down 6.4 per cent from $407.02 last year. That marked the second year in a row spending was down.
Part of the reason is that Target, Macy's, Wal-Mart and other major retailers pushed fat holiday discounts as early as Halloween and opened stores even earlier on Thanksgiving to kick off the holiday shopping season, stealing some thunder from Black Friday and the rest of the weekend.
The preliminary data also raises worries shoppers remain frugal despite improving employment and falling gas prices.
Matt Shay, the trade group's CEO, told reporters that the effect of the economy is puzzling, but he believes that people benefiting a recovering economy may not feel the need to fight the crowds to get the deepest discount on a TV or toaster. And those who still feel like they're still stuck in a recession may not have the money and will stretch out what they spend through Christmas.
``While they're more optimistic, they're very cautious,'' Shay told reporters during a conference call. ``They're still looking for the deals. If the deals are not right for them, they're not going to spend.''
Bottom line: Expect more deep discounting, all season long.
``Every day will be Black Friday. Every minute will be Cyber Monday,'' he said.
That could be what it takes to get shoppers to open their wallets for the holiday shopping season, which accounts for 20 per cent of the retail industry's annual sales.
Despite an improving economy, high food prices and stagnant wages are still affecting on shoppers.
And people also are becoming more discerning when they shop. Armed with smartphones and price-comparison apps, they know what's a good deal, and what's not.
Kimani Brown, 39, of Manhattan, was among the Black Friday defectors. After four years of braving the crowds, he called it quits this year.
``I consider myself a smart shopper. And it's not as alluring as it used to be,'' Brown said. "It's a marketing tool, and I don't want to be pulled into it.'' He said he looked at the sales and wasn't impressed.
Moreover, he says he tended to overspend during the Black Friday sales because he got caught up in the frenzy, and he paid the price in January when he looked at his credit card statement.
  Instead, he says he will be looking at what is known as Cyber Monday, the online shopping day after Thanksgiving weekend.
And some Thanksgiving shoppers felt they were doing it against their will. Cathyliz Lopez, of New York City, said she was forced to shop on the holiday because they felt the deals were better than Black Friday.
``It's ruining the spirit of Thanksgiving,'' said the 20-year-old who was shopping at Target's East Harlem store on Thursday. ``But I was checking all the ads, and the best deals were today.''
The National Retail Federation is still predicting a 4.1 per cent increase in holiday sales to $616.9 billion. That would be the highest increase since the 4.8 per cent gain in 2011.
Some stores and malls had reason to be optimistic
Dan Jasper, a spokesman at Bloomington, Minnesota-based Mall of America, said customer counts are tracking up 5 to 6 per cent for the four-day weekend. One plus: Shoppers were doing more buying for themselves.
``People were in an optimistic mood,'' he said. ``They felt confident in the economy.''
CEOs at Target and Toys R Us said they saw shoppers not just concentrated on the doorbuster items but throwing in extra items in their carts. Macy's CEO Terry Lundgren told The Associated Press that he's hoping lower gas prices will help spending.
``There's reason to believe that confidence should continue to grow. That should be good for discretionary spending,'' he said.
In a separate report out Saturday, IBM said online sales for Black Friday climbed 9.5 per cent over the same day last year. More than one of every four transactions was made using a smartphone or tablet computer.
But the early start pulled sales forward, resulting in sales declines at stores for Black Friday for the second time in a row. Shoppers spent $9.1 billion at stores on Black Friday, according to data out Saturday from research firm ShopperTrak. That's a drop of 7 per cent compared with the same day last year.
Sales on Thanksgiving jumped 24 per cent to $3.2 billion from $2.5 billion a year ago. And overall sales for the two days are expected to slip half a per cent to $12.29 billion. Those figures don't include online transactions.

Hong Kong activists, police clash outside government headquarters

(Pro-democracy protesters…)
HONG KONG: Pro-democracy protesters clashed with police as they tried to surround Hong Kong government headquarters late Sunday, stepping up their movement for genuine democratic reforms after camping out on the city's streets for more than two months.
Repeating scenes that have become familiar since the movement began in late September, protesters carrying umbrellas _ which have become symbols of the pro-democracy movement _ battled police armed with pepper spray, batons and riot shields.
After student leaders told a big crowd rallying at the main protest site outside government headquarters that they would escalate their campaign, hundreds of protesters charged past police lines on the other side of the complex from the protest site. They blocked traffic on a main road, but were stopped by police barricades from going down a side road to Chief Executive Leung Chun-Ying's office.
Protesters said they wanted to occupy the road until at least the next morning to prevent Leung and other government officials from getting to work, but police in the early hours of Monday charged the crowd, aggressively pushing demonstrators back with pepper spray and batons.
Police arrested at least five protesters, according to the Hong Kong Federation of Students, one of the groups that have played important roles in organizing the protest movement, which is seeking free elections in the former British colony.
Many in the crowd were wearing surgical masks, hard hats and safety goggles. They shouted ``I want true democracy.''
Protesters said they were taking action to force a response from Hong Kong's government, which has made little effort to address their demands that it scrap a plan by China's Communist leaders to use a panel of Beijing-friendly elites to screen candidates for Hong Kong's leader in inaugural 2017 elections.
``We want to upgrade our action to force the government to make some statements about our goal'' of genuine democracy, said protester Ernie Kwok, 21, a maintenance worker and part-time student. ``I really want to have real elections for Hong Kong because I don't want the Chinese government to control us, our minds, anything.''
Earlier Sunday, police warned that they would take action to prevent the protesters from surrounding government headquarters. They said in a statement that they would ``take resolute enforcement actions'' and would ``use minimum level of force to stop any violent and illegal acts, so as to uphold the law and order.''
Authorities last week used an aggressive operation to clear out the protest camp on the busy streets of Hong Kong's crowded Mong Kok district, one of three protest zones around the semiautonomous city.
In Britain, a lawmakers' committee said the Chinese Embassy had warned that its members would be refused entry if they tried to go ahead with a visit to Hong Kong as part of an inquiry into the city's relations with the U.K. since the handover of sovereignty to China in 1997.
  Richard Ottaway, chairman of Parliament's committee on foreign affairs, said the Chinese authorities were acting in an ``overtly confrontational manner.'' He said he would seek an emergency parliamentary debate on the development.
The Foreign Office called the Chinese message to the lawmakers ``regrettable'' and said it has expressed its position to the Chinese side ``at the most senior levels.''

("The recent unveiling of…)
Geoff Lewis, executive director and global market strategist at JPMorgan AMC, has said the government policy reforms tabled so far have not been surprising, but rather they appear to be many small steps in the right direction. The introduction of new projects and return of Indian entrepreneurs' animal spirits will take time before showing more visible effect. Edited excerpts from an interview with ET..
How do you think the Bank of Japan's stimulus announcement and European Central Bank's (ECB) likely quantitative easing will aid emerging markets' equity performance?
The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan must continue to expand their balance sheets to fight deflationary pressures.
Despite some increase in volatility, overall global liquidity for markets should remain flush. In emerging markets, we continue to expect an uncomfortable period of adjustment in 2015 relating to recent rapid build-up in debt together with strengthening of the US dollar.
The US Federal Reserve prepares to hike rates next year. How do you think this will impact global financial markets?
While the US continues to normalise its monetary policies, the key implications are --stronger US dollar, continued weakness in global commodity prices, and looser monetary conditions globally. We expect very gradual and cautious raising of short-term US interest rates by the Federal Reserve in the second half of 2014. We believe that the impact on markets when it happens will be more benign than many investors are currently fearing.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has completed over 6 months in his office. How do you rate the performance of new government against expectations?
One of the most crucial issues for Modi's government has been the reforms necessary to stem major issues the country is currently facing - raising economic growth from multi-year lows, taming inflation, and getting spiralling deficits under control. And Modi seems to have taken long-term view on solving these issues, considering that he has at least one full term of around 5 years and quite likely the second to push forward his plans. So far, the reforms tabled have not been surprising, but rather they appear to be many small steps in right direction that in sum are likely to have a material impact over a period of time.
What is your view on government reform policies, and do you think they are right enough to bring back India's economic growth back on track?
The recent unveiling of the 'Make in India' campaign aimed at attracting business to set up manufacturing in India will hopefully add to the positive investment climate.
Modinomics will only succeed in the longer term if it can galvanise the private sector.
Government policies alone will not be enough to restore GDP growth to 6.5% or higher. The recent uptick in capex is a good sign while the introduction of new projects and the return of Indian entrepreneurs' animal spirits will take time before having a more visible effect. A GDP growth rate close to 7% should be possible for India over the medium term.
  How do you think easing global commodity prices can boost India's prospects for faster economic growth?
The cheaper oil prices have been in particular a boon for Modi, who reassuringly took the opportunity provided to deregulate the retail diesel price and streamline various fuel subsides. These cuts will also help the Modi government in its attempt to reach the fiscal deficit target of around 4% of GDP. More rapid progress in defeating inflation will help bring forward the timing of monetary easing and interest rate cuts.
RBI has expressed to break the back of inflation before considering monetary policy decisions. What is your outlook on interest rates scenario?
Inflation has now fallen below RBI's 6% target for January 2016, causing some speculation of a rate cut in the near future, possibly even at the December meeting. We would not expect the first interest rate cut to come from RBI until February. However, we also recognise that with inflation having fallen so quickly, there will be growing impatience within some parts of the new government to see the benefits of rate cut. RBI may come under growing political pressure the longer it holds out while FIIs will not wish to see any major rift on monetary policy between the Modi administration and India's central bank.
What are your earnings growth expectations?
There has so far been little sign of pick-up in consensus earnings, but we believe that we are getting closer to a major inflection point for earnings. Over the medium term, a compounded growth (CAGR) of 15-18% for Indian equity markets should be achievable if Modi's programme to raise potential growth is a success.
What's your biggest concern about Indian markets?
In the short term , the rather disappointing earnings season YTD, and investor impatience over the speed of cyclical recovery or with the progress of Modinomics might become the trigger for more significant locally-driven market correction than in October. Such a market correction would offer investors who are late to India story a good entry point as we believe that the next big theme for the Indian equity market is likely to be a strong domestically-led secular recovery in earnings.
What are your economic growth expectations for FY16?
Six percent appears conservative as forecast for GDP growth in CY2015 as many sell-side brokers have pencilled in a figure that is closer to 7% than 6%. If all goes well, then 6.5% is possible, but we would caution against investors looking for an early return to higher growth path without the prior implementation of supply-side reforms and visible improvement in trend productivity.

Vimal Bhatia,TNN | Dec 1, 2014, 05.04 AM IST - - - - -$$$$$
JAISALMER: Hundreds of floodlights along the border fencing and posts manned by BSF at the India-Pakistan border will soon get lighted with solar energy. Union home ministry as pilot project has approved to set up solar power house of five mega watt capacity at Tala area at Jaisalmer in Rajasthan. If this solar power project is successful then at all the international borders of the country will have solar-powered lighting, implemented in phases. The government would save crores of rupees using solar power and also save on diesel used for generators.

BSF assistant engineer Hari Ram, who is playing an important role in setting up this pilot project said that on the guidelines of union home ministry, solar-based water heating system of five mega watt is proposed to be set up at Jaisalmer. Solar Energy Corporation of India will set up this pilot project. Recently, deputy manager Ankit Agarwal had visited the area for survey and had discussions with the officers concerned.
He said that the cost would be around Rs 35 crore and power generated from the solar power project will be used for supplying electricity to border posts and floodlights.
BSF DIG Amit Lodha said that with setting up of such type of solar energy vapour project, there would be an end to huge diesel expenses that is used for running the generator sets.
On the other hand, another senior official said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given directions to set up solar energy plants nearby border posts to cut the huge electricity expenses on border posts. The PMO has sent a note in this regard to union home ministry.

#Brands have taken over everything else  so why not Advent calendarsBy Abby Ohlheiser November 28 Follow @abbyohlheiser
If all you want for Christmas is to learn more about #brands, then boy oh boy are you ever in for a holiday miracle! This season, you can buy your loved ones an Advent calendar from a brand.
Advent, of course, is the theological name for the Christian season beginning four Sundays before Christmas (this year, that means Nov. 30). Christians traditionally spend that season celebrating the first coming of Christ and anticipating his second coming.
One traditional way to mark the season: Advent candles — one for each Sunday, often nestled in a wreath. These days, many families use Advent calendars, too.
The calendars often offer a small gift — often chocolate — each day of the Advent season. They’re basically perfect for brands: Put some otherwise free samples in a decorated box with some cool doors, and suddenly those samples are a collector’s item! Or at least they’re the perfect early holiday gift, exposing people to various products during the busiest shopping season of the year.
But, you say, there are so many brands out there. How do I choose? Which #brand is my brand? Can I sell my Advent calendar on eBay even after I use it? ( Yes. ) Can you please bring back Mark Berman and get this nonsense off the Post Nation blog? ( Not yet! )
Anyway, here are some options to help you choose the branded Advent calendar that is correct for you.
Lego
Lego Advent calendars, I am told, are kind of a big deal. A cursory search corroborates this: The company offers several different themed calendars for sale this year, including a “friends” Advent calendar — which is pink and purple and I assume is targeting small human girls; a “city” Advent calendar ; and, brand upon brand, a “Star Wars” Advent calendar.
Each day reveals a different toy, like a tiny Lego dog, a tiny Lego man (or woman), or a tiny Lego couch.
According to Lego, these calendars cost anywhere from about $30 for the city version to $40 for the “Star Wars” one. Except the “Star Wars” calendar is already sold out on the official Lego site, which means you could end up paying more .
Verdict: Hmm. If they made an Advent calendar for their women in STEM line, I’d think about it.
Yankee Candle Company
I went to college near the Yankee Candle company’s Massachusetts headquarters. How do I know this? The same way I know there’s a Yankee Candle Company outpost in a mall: With proximity comes an overwhelming smell. So the highway in Deerfield, Mass., smells like Mixed Yankee Candle Company, which smells more or less like this optical illusion looks.
So if you want that smell in your home, in a more controlled, holiday-related way, buy this Advent calendar. On the company’s British site, enthusiasts can buy a wreath-shaped Advent calendar with several “winter” scented tea candles inside. The American “Christmas Countdown Calendar” is more bland. Scent of a #brand cost: About $25.
Verdict: My head still hurts from looking at that optical illusion.
Angry Birds
For the analog game enthusiast who also loves apps, there is this Advent calendar-game filled with pieces of plastic that look like items from Angry Birds, the phone game. It’s manufactured by Mattel.
Description: “Now kids can play their #1 favorite app game in real life.”
None of the birds have special powers, or whatever is great about the birds on the phone game.
The plastic version of Angry Birds in a box costs $22 on Amazon .
Verdict: I don’t really understand how this is festive, but okay.
Starbucks
Mini grahams! Gift cards! Reusable tins! A chalkboard!
Starbucks apparently went to a craft store and made you this Pinterest-y Advent calendar .
Because it’s impossible to put a mint latte in a tin a month in advance, most of the treats here are chocolate-covered graham crackers. The ultimate prize? A $5 gift card to Starbucks, so you can buy a latte yourself.
Verdict: People already measure the beginning of the holiday season with the sudden appearance of red cups in Starbucks stores, so this #brand’s aesthetic spread into Advent calendars seems inevitable. Next year: Starbucks-brand Christmas trees?
The Body Shop
Like Lego Advent calendars, cosmetics Advent calendars are also apparently a huge thing, but for a slightly different demographic. And they can get expensive (more on that later).
The Beauty Advent Calendar, from the Body Shop, is just $50. You have to buy it in a Body Shop store.
Verdict: This Advent calendar gives six cents to War Child, a charity that works on education access in conflict zones. So that’s nice.
Benefit Cosmetics
For the price of two Body Shop Advent calendars, you could buy this Benefit Cosmetics sample Advent calendar.
For 24 days of samples. I don’t know what else to say.
 Verdict: I give up.

Ray Rice Wins Appeal  Suspension Vacated ImmediatelyRay Rice Wins Appeal, Suspension Vacated Immediately
Associated Press
reddit
NEW YORK (AP) — Ray Rice has won the appeal of his indefinite suspension by the NFL.
An arbitrator ruled Friday that his suspension for punching his fiancee, now his wife, should be vacated immediately. The NFL said Rice, a free agent, is "eligible to play upon signing a new contract."
Former U.S. District Judge Barbara S. Jones said Commissioner Roger Goodell's decision in September to change Rice's original suspension from two games to indefinite was "arbitrary" and an "abuse of discretion."
Jones was deciding whether the NFL overstepped its authority in modifying Rice's two-game suspension after video of the Baltimore Ravens running back punching Janay became public.
Rice was released by the Ravens when the video went public. Rice and the union contended he was essentially sentenced twice, and Jones agreed.
She noted in her decision that after Goodell increased the punishment for a first offense under the personal conduct policy from two to six games, "the commissioner called Rice to assure him that the new policy would not affect him — that it was forward-looking and his penalty would not be increased."
In her decision, Jones also wrote:
"Because Rice did not mislead the commissioner and because there were no new facts on which the commissioner could base his increased suspension, I find that the imposition of the indefinite suspension was arbitrary. I therefore vacate the second penalty imposed on Rice.
"The provisions of the first discipline — those regarding making continued use of counseling and other professional services, having no further involvement with law enforcement, and not committing any additional violations of league policies — still stand."
The NFL said it accepted the decision.
"We respect Judge Jones's decision to reinstate Ray Rice from his indefinite suspension for violating the league's personal conduct policy in an incident of domestic violence," spokesman Greg Aiello said in an email to The Associated Press.
"Ray Rice is a free agent and has been eligible to be signed by an NFL team since he was released by the Ravens. Based on Judge Jones' decision, he will be eligible to play upon signing a new contract."
Goodell and the Rices testified at the hearing, as did NFL security chief Jeffrey Miller and Ravens general manager Ozzie Newsome. During his appearance, Goodell told Jones: "I do accept that I have to be consistent with consistent circumstances, and ... I think that's about fairness, and fairness would be, you should be as consistent as possible in your discipline."
The NFL Players Association claimed a "victory for a disciplinary process that is fair and transparent" in a statement. The union called again for collective bargaining to produce a new personal conduct policy.

Modinomics will succeed if it can galvanise pvt sector: Geoff LewisModinomics will succeed only if it can galvanise private sector, says Geoff Lewis, JPMorgan AMC

Geoff Lewis, executive director and global market strategist at JPMorgan AMC, has said the government policy reforms tabled so far have not been surprising, but rather they appear to be many small steps in the right direction. The introduction of new projects and return of Indian entrepreneurs' animal spirits will take time before showing more visible effect. Edited excerpts from an interview with ET..
How do you think the Bank of Japan's stimulus announcement and European Central Bank's (ECB) likely quantitative easing will aid emerging markets' equity performance?
The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan must continue to expand their balance sheets to fight deflationary pressures.
Despite some increase in volatility, overall global liquidity for markets should remain flush. In emerging markets, we continue to expect an uncomfortable period of adjustment in 2015 relating to recent rapid build-up in debt together with strengthening of the US dollar.
The US Federal Reserve prepares to hike rates next year. How do you think this will impact global financial markets?
While the US continues to normalise its monetary policies, the key implications are --stronger US dollar, continued weakness in global commodity prices, and looser monetary conditions globally. We expect very gradual and cautious raising of short-term US interest rates by the Federal Reserve in the second half of 2014. We believe that the impact on markets when it happens will be more benign than many investors are currently fearing.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has completed over 6 months in his office. How do you rate the performance of new government against expectations?
One of the most crucial issues for Modi's government has been the reforms necessary to stem major issues the country is currently facing - raising economic growth from multi-year lows, taming inflation, and getting spiralling deficits under control. And Modi seems to have taken long-term view on solving these issues, considering that he has at least one full term of around 5 years and quite likely the second to push forward his plans. So far, the reforms tabled have not been surprising, but rather they appear to be many small steps in right direction that in sum are likely to have a material impact over a period of time.
What is your view on government reform policies, and do you think they are right enough to bring back India's economic growth back on track?
The recent unveiling of the 'Make in India' campaign aimed at attracting business to set up manufacturing in India will hopefully add to the positive investment climate.
Modinomics will only succeed in the longer term if it can galvanise the private sector.
Government policies alone will not be enough to restore GDP growth to 6.5% or higher. The recent uptick in capex is a good sign while the introduction of new projects and the return of Indian entrepreneurs' animal spirits will take time before having a more visible effect. A GDP growth rate close to 7% should be possible for India over the medium term.
  How do you think easing global commodity prices can boost India's prospects for faster economic growth?
The cheaper oil prices have been in particular a boon for Modi, who reassuringly took the opportunity provided to deregulate the retail diesel price and streamline various fuel subsides. These cuts will also help the Modi government in its attempt to reach the fiscal deficit target of around 4% of GDP. More rapid progress in defeating inflation will help bring forward the timing of monetary easing and interest rate cuts.
RBI has expressed to break the back of inflation before considering monetary policy decisions. What is your outlook on interest rates scenario?
Inflation has now fallen below RBI's 6% target for January 2016, causing some speculation of a rate cut in the near future, possibly even at the December meeting. We would not expect the first interest rate cut to come from RBI until February. However, we also recognise that with inflation having fallen so quickly, there will be growing impatience within some parts of the new government to see the benefits of rate cut. RBI may come under growing political pressure the longer it holds out while FIIs will not wish to see any major rift on monetary policy between the Modi administration and India's central bank.
What are your earnings growth expectations?
There has so far been little sign of pick-up in consensus earnings, but we believe that we are getting closer to a major inflection point for earnings. Over the medium term, a compounded growth (CAGR) of 15-18% for Indian equity markets should be achievable if Modi's programme to raise potential growth is a success.
What's your biggest concern about Indian markets?
In the short term , the rather disappointing earnings season YTD, and investor impatience over the speed of cyclical recovery or with the progress of Modinomics might become the trigger for more significant locally-driven market correction than in October. Such a market correction would offer investors who are late to India story a good entry point as we believe that the next big theme for the Indian equity market is likely to be a strong domestically-led secular recovery in earnings.
What are your economic growth expectations for FY16?
Six percent appears conservative as forecast for GDP growth in CY2015 as many sell-side brokers have pencilled in a figure that is closer to 7% than 6%. If all goes well, then 6.5% is possible, but we would caution against investors looking for an early return to higher growth path without the prior implementation of supply-side reforms and visible improvement in trend productivity.

Forex reserves fall by US $672.4 mn to US $314.87 bnForex reserves fall by US $672.4 million on decline in core currency assets
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: November 29, 2014  | 09:19 IST
(Photo: Reuters)
The country's foreign exchange reserves dipped by US $672.4 million to US $314.878 billion due to a decline in core currency assets, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in Mumbai on Friday.
Total forex reserves were up by US $419.4 million to US $315.55 billion during the previous reporting week.
Foreign currency assets , a major constituent of overall reserves, decreased by US $664.3 million to US $289.398 billion for the week ended November 21, the central bank said.
Dollar-denominated foreign currency assets include the effect of appreciation and depreciation of non-US currencies such as euro, pound and the yen held in reserves.
Domestic gold reserves remained unchanged at US $19.738 billion for the reporting week, RBI said.
The special drawing rights (SDRs) were down by US $5.9 million to US $4.223 billion, while the country's reserve position with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) declined by US $2.2 million to US $1.518 billion during the week, the data released by RBI showed.

Focus On Profits Is Not Enough For A Great Businessreddit
It's always been tough to start a new business, even when the bottom line was just making a profit to stay alive. A few years ago, a second focus of sustainability ("green") was added as a requirement for respectability. Now I often hear a third mandate of social responsibility. Entrepreneurs are now measured against the "triple bottom line" (TBL or 3BL) of people, planet, and profit.
The real challenge with the triple bottom line is that these three separate accounts cannot be easily added up. It's difficult to measure the planet and people accounts in any quantifiable terms, compared to profits. How does any entrepreneur define the right balance, and then measure their performance against real metrics?
Lots of people are trying to help, with new twists on the age-old model of free-market capitalism that has driven businesses for the last 500 years. Current examples include the Conscious Capitalism® movement led by John Mackey, The B Team , led by Sir Richard Branson, the 1% for the Planet organization, and the Benefit Corporation (B Corp) now available in 20 States.
In the interest of helping first-time entrepreneurs, as well as existing business executives, keep their sanity as well as their focus, I offer the following pragmatic suggestions for dealing with the triple bottom line requirements:
Sort out your personal definition of success first. Starting and running any business is hard work, so the last thing you need is "success" with no satisfaction. If your primary dream is to help the starving people around the world, or prevent global warming, you might consider a non-profit, academic, on government role, rather be an entrepreneur.
Making a profit does not imply greed. Many young entrepreneurs seem to think that capitalism and making profit are dirty words. The reality is that you can't help people or the environment, or yourself, if you don't have any money. Businesses run by ethical people create value and prosperity based on voluntary exchange, while reducing poverty.
Sustainability and social responsibility alone don't make a viable business. As an Angel investor, I see too many business proposals that are heavy on sustainability, but light on financial realities. Most customers today won't pay you five times the cost of alternatives, just because yours is "green."
The whole can be greater than the sum of the parts. The real opportunity for entrepreneurs is to provide solutions that solve a problem better than the competition, while also providing sustainability and social responsibility. Conscious Capitalism, for example, claims 3.2 times the return of other companies over the last 10 years.
Responsibility and integrity are still the key. A responsible entrepreneur promotes both loyalty and responsible consumption by educating consumers so they can make more informed decisions about their purchases, based on ecological footprints, and other sustainability criteria. That's a win-win business for the customer and the entrepreneur.
Explore new forms of company ownership and profit sharing. There is no rule in capitalism that employees and other stakeholders can't equitably share in the returns. In fact, there is plenty of evidence that these arrangements, such as with Whole Foods , are easy to implement, and pay big productivity, loyalty, as well as financial dividends.
Begin tracking your positive social and environmental impacts. What you measure is what you get, because what you measure is what you are likely to pay attention to. Tracking can be informal, or you can follow a more formal system, like Global Impact Investing Ratings System (GIIRS). Even informal results can be your best advertising.
It's a lot more productive and a lot less risky to start early in building your record of the positives on social, environmental, and people responsibility, rather than wait and hope never to be caught in an excessive profits scandal, child labor issue, or poor sustainability practice.
So while the bar for business success continues to go up, because we all now operate on a world stage, the entrepreneur "best practices" haven't changed. Every entrepreneur needs to start with a strong vision, think long-term, communicate effectively, and always lead with responsibility and integrity. The days of success measured only by monetary returns are over. How does your business stack up against the triple bottom line?

BlackBerry courts iPhone users with cash
Customers who trade in their iPhones could receive up to $400 cash back depending on the model and condition of their trade-in, plus a $150 gift card.
AFP Relaxnews –  Sat 29 Nov, 2014

MONTREAL: Canadian smartphone maker BlackBerry is wooing Apple customers with a cash offer for trade-ins of iPhones for its new square-screened, keyboard-equipped Passport.
The promotion was announced late Monday and will be available starting next month until February 13, in Canada and the United States.
Customers who trade in their iPhones could receive up to $400 cash back depending on the model and condition of their trade-in, plus a $150 gift card.
This marks the first time that BlackBerry has gone head-to-head with Apple since the Canadian firm launched a turnaround plan last year aimed at stemming massive losses.
The Passport was launched in September.
After months of teasing, BlackBerry's latest and most interesting device for some time, the Passport, has finally launched in India at a price of Rs 49,990.

Named for its approximate size to the travel document, the phone was designed to win back key corporate users after BlackBerry was effectively knocked out of the highly competitive consumer smartphone market dominated by Apple and Samsung.
Investors seemed pleased, pushing up the Waterloo, Ontario-based company's share price slightly in morning trading.
But analysts were more skeptical. Carl Simard of Medici called it a very "desperate move."
In September, BlackBerry reported it narrowed its loss in the latest quarter, and expressed optimism that its major restructuring and new business-friendly devices would help fuel a turnaround.
For the three months ended August 30, BlackBerry posted a loss of $207 million on $916 billion in revenues largely split between sales of services and software and more than two million smartphones.
The Canadian manufacturer pioneered the smartphone market but has struggled to keep up with competitors in recent years.
Last year, the company introduced the BlackBerry 10 operating system and new smartphones in an effort to regain ground lost to rivals such as Apple and others using the Google Android operating system.

Gold at 2-week low on easing of import curbsfiscal deficit
(Gold in global market, which…)
NEW DELHI: Gold prices today plunged by Rs 270 to trade at over two-week low of Rs 26,400 per ten gram in the national capital after the Reserve Bank yesterday eased curbs on import of the precious metal.
Silver also extended losses for the third day and tumbled by Rs 820 to Rs 35,380 per kg on poor offtake by industrial units and coin makers.
Easing restrictions on gold imports, the Reserve Bank yesterday scrapped the controversial 80:20 scheme.
Under the 80:20 norm, put in place in August 2013 to curb high gold inflows that was widening the current account deficit, at least 20 per cent of the imported gold had to be mandatorily exported before bringing in new lots.
Bullion traders attributed the fall in gold prices to easing restrictions on gold imports by the RBI by scrapping the controversial scheme, which is likely to enhance supplies and check smuggling of the precious metal.
"The RBI move will improve supplies in the market and bring down gold prices further in coming days," All India Sarafa Association vice-president Surinder Kumar Jain said, adding the strengthening dollar, however, will limit fall in prices.
He said the import curbs had restricted availability of the basic raw material for the jewellery sector.
Besides, a weak global trend where gold weakened as a stronger dollar and falling crude prices, curbing demand for the precious metal, weighed on the gold prices.
Gold in global market, which normally sets price trend on the domestic front, fell by 1.80 per cent, the biggest fall since November 5, to 1,175.50 an ounce in New York.
Silver too tumbled by 6.3 per cent, the biggest drop since June 2013, to $15.55 an ounce in yesterday's trade.
In Delhi, gold of 99.9 and 99.5 per cent purity plunged by Rs 270 each to Rs 26,400 and Rs 26,200 per ten gram respectively, a level last seen on November 12.
Sovereign traded lower by Rs 100 to Rs 23,600 per piece of eight gram.
In line with weak trend, silver ready also recorded a hefty fall of Rs 820 to Rs 35,380 per kg and weekly-based delivery by Rs 1,085 to Rs 34,525 per kg.
On the other hand, silver coins remained steady at Rs 61,000 for buying and Rs 62,000 for selling of 100 pieces.

(All the parameters are now…)
In an interview with ET Now, Vijay Kedia, MD, Kedia Securities, shares his views on the markets. Excerpts:
Nikunj Dalmia: 2014 has been a great year for the Indian stock markets. After this extraordinary run-up, do you think the party is getting over?
Vijay Kedia: I do not think so. Party has just begun.
Nikunj Dalmia: Why do you think the party has just started?
Vijay Kedia: Because all the parameters are now in the favour of the economy and still, retail participation in market is very less and the economy is reviving. Companies have yet to deliver good numbers and return. So it is just a beginning.
Nikunj Dalmia: External factors are clearly are on our side. Brazil is in a mess, Russia seems to be falling apart, ECB and BOJ are committed to print more money and we do not know what will happen to the US economy in the short term. So, do you think India on the margin will benefit because globally things are in a mess?
Vijay Kedia: That could be an advantage for India in other words. So, why not?
Nikunj Dalmia: Three years ago, I remember, when we interacted on this same forum, your big call was that the Sensex will eventually touch 1 lakh. We are at 27000. Are you still confident that the Sensex will touch 1 lakh?
Vijay Kedia: Yes, of course. On the contrary, I will say that my confidence has increased. I am of the opinion that by 2020, the Sensex should touch 100,000.
Nikunj Dalmia: That is a big number, isn't it?
Vijay Kedia: Could be a big number today. It looks like a big number, but I have some reasons why should it be 100,000 by 2020. I will give you an example. Prior to 2003, any bull market in India never lasted for more than nine months. If I say bull market, that means the previous top to the next top. So the duration of every bull market was less than 9 months and the duration of every bear market was more than 16 months. This was the history.
Nikunj Dalmia: This was before 2003?
Vijay Kedia: Before 2003.
Nikunj Dalmia: So you are looking at the Sensex history from 1980 to 2003?
Vijay Kedia: Yes, you can say that.
Nikunj Dalmia: That time bull markets were small and bear markets were big.
Vijay Kedia: Yes, the bull market was smaller, means not more than nine months. I may be wrong by 1 month or 15 days, but I am near perfect figure.
 
For the first time it happened in the history of India in 2003 that the bull market lasted for five years or six years, and when the bear market came, it lasted for less than 16 months. If you remember, from 22000, we went down to 7200 or 7300, but within a span of nine months, we recovered.
Nikunj Dalmia: So now the reverse is happening. Now bear markets are small and bull markets are long.
Vijay Kedia: Yes, they are long. The same story is now going to be repeated. I think that we are in a bull market. So if you take the clue from the past history, we should be having another five or six years of a bull run and in the last bull market, 6000 was the top before 2003.
Nikunj Dalmia: The TMT bull market?
Vijay Kedia: Yes, the TMT bull market. So when the index crossed 6000, it went up to 22000. That was somewhere around four times. I think the same story is going to be repeated again.
Nikunj Dalmia: So, what is the real entry point or the beginning point of this bull market? Is it 8000 because we bottomed out at 8000 in 2008 or the beginning entry point of this bull market will be closer to 21000 or 22000?
Vijay Kedia: Around 20000-22000, not 8000.
Nikunj Dalmia: Are you of the view that the bull market has only started last year, it has not started three years ago?
Vijay Kedia: I do not think so. It depends on how you calculate. That could be the end of a bear market. As they say that the end of a bear market is the beginning of a bull market, but the actual bull market has started now.
Nikunj Dalmia: So in this bull market, can the Sensex go to 100,000?
Vijay Kedia: Yes, this is what I think that in this current bull market, which is going on, we should see the index of 100,000.
Nikunj Dalmia: For the Sensex to go to 100,000, a lot of things have to align our way both locally and globally. Inflation is still sticky, valuations are not all that cheap and earnings are still a big question mark.
Vijay Kedia: That is why we are at 27000, because of that only.
Nikunj Dalmia: So how will things change? For the index to go to 100,000, the dynamics have to change completely.
Vijay Kedia: It is changing. When I read newspapers in the morning, I feel that something is happening in India, something is cooking. It might take some time as all experts are saying.
Nikunj Dalmia: There is an old saying on the Wall Street that bull markets always climb the wall of worry and they always come down on ray of hope.
Vijay Kedia: Yes.
Nikunj Dalmia: I just get a sense that right now, there is too much of hope and hype in the Modi story.

JSW Plans Rs 2 000-Cr Iron Ore PipelineMotherson Sumi's German Acquisition to Be EPS Accretive
Kolkata: JSW Steel is working towards a de-risking strategy for iron ore that will fuel its ambition to turn its Bellary plant into world's largest single site steel plant by 2022.
"We are setting up 500km slurry pipeline to import iron ore into the Vijayanagar plant in Bellary from a port near Goa. My vision is to turn Vijayanagar from 10 million tonne to 20 million tonne, world's largest single site steel plant by 2022," JSW Steel chairman and managing director Sajjan Jindal said here on Sunday.
He was speaking on the sidelines of inauguration of Ispat Pragati Bhawan, the new office of Insdag.
He said Karnataka can offer the maximum iron ore of 15 million tonnes, while to take the steel production to 20 million tonnes, JSW would require 35 million tonnes of iron ore.
Mr Jindal said that laying the 500 km pipeline from Jaigarh near Goa to Bellary district would cost about Rs 2,000 crore and the same will come up over the next two years.
The project will pump imported iron ore from overseas sources and will have an annual freight cost saving of Rs 2,000 crore and that will help neutralise the cost disadvantage of imported iron ore, the company said.
JSW said only 50 per cent of its iron ore requirement is fed by domestic sources, mostly from Karnataka.

Campaign ends for round two in J&K  Jharkhand assembly pollsPress Trust of India | Nov 30, 2014 at 07:34pm IST
Srinagar/Ranchi: The high-pitched campaign for the second phase of election on December 2 in 18 seats in Jammu and Kashmir and 20 in Jharkhand ended on Sunday with Prime Minister Narendra spearheading BJP's bid too woo voters even as the performance of his government came under attack.
The campaign fever had heightened in Jammu and Kashmir after a record over 71 per cent voting in 15 seats during the first phase on November 25.
Nine seats in Jammu and as many in Kashmir are going to polls in the second phase with 175 candidates in fray, including several high-profile candidates like former separatist Sajad Lone and four state ministers.
The campaign fever had heightened in Jammu and Kashmir after a record over 71 per cent voting in 15 seats during the first phase on November 25.
In Jharkhand, former Chief Ministers Arjun Munda and Madhu Koda and three ministers are among 223 candidates, including 35 women, contesting from 20 seats-- 16 of them reserved for tribals. Both the states are witnessing multi-cornered contests.
Of the nine constituencies in the Valley, the contest in Handwara in north Kashmir has evoked interest as Lone is making debut in assembly elections after unsuccessfully contesting the Lok Sabha polls in 2009. BJP has not fielded its candidate from Handwara segment.
Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, who is leading the campaign of National Confernce, had accused Lone of ganging up with the BJP, which he alleged wants to end the special status of the state.
"Today, suddenly one of the leaders (Sajad Lone) sees a brother in (Prime Minister) Narendra Modi. The brother who wants to remove Article 370, the flag and the Constitution of this state," he had said.
The only woman minister in National Conference-led coalition government, Sakina Ittoo, is among the four ministers in the fray for Noorabad assembly segment going to polls in Tuesday. Other ministers from her party inlcude Law Minister Saifullah Mir (Kupwara) and Chaudhary Mohammad Ramzan (Handwara) while Ajaz Ahmad Khan (Gool Arnas) is from Congress.
A total of 15.35 lakh people are eligible to vote. Security arrangements have been tightened following a terrorist attack in Arnia on November 28 in which 10 people lost their lives and a grenade attack in Srinagar yesterday in which eight people were injured. on Saturday, militants had also triggered a blast targeting an army vehicle near LoC in Poonch, but the troops escaped unhurt.
The campaigning for the second phase saw many political bigwigs addressing rallies including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress President Sonia Gandhi and party Vice President Rahul Gandhi.
While BJP led by Modi raised the issue of corruption and dynastic politics and promised to bring development, it remained silent on the controversial issues of abrogation of Article 370 relating to special staus to Jammu and Kashmir.
The party released a vision document in which it tried to woo Kashmiri Pandits by promising to reserve three seats in Kashmir for the community displaced from the Valley due to militancy.
Ruling National Conference said it would oppose any attempt to "tamper" with Article 370 and press for the reversal of "erosion" of the constitutional provision over the years.
Targeting Modi government, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi alleged that it was being run by big industrialists and had failed to fulfill the promises made during the election campaign.

His knock of 151 helps the team register a 52-run win over North
Manoj Tiwary’s splendid knock guided East Zone to a 52-run victory over North Zone in the first semifinal of the Deodhar Trophy at the Wankhede Stadium here on Sunday. This was the Bengal batsman’s second century in domestic limited-overs tournaments, the first (130) coming 10 days ago against Vidarbha at Rajkot in the Vijay Hazare Trophy.
A typically-determined Tiwary began the repair work along with opener Shreevats Goswami as early as the 12th over, held the innings together even as wickets tumbled at the other end and finished at an imposing 151 (15x4, 4x6). His score was the second highest in the tournament, behind Vidyut Sivaramakrishnan’s 158 for South against Central at Jaipur in 2006.
East will play the winner of the second semifinal between West and South in the title-match on Wednesday.
Tiwary and Goswami scored at almost run-a-ball during their fourth-wicket association, lifting East from a dismal 33 for two to 93, before the left-handed Goswami pulled leg-spinner Amit Mishra to mid-wicket where Mandeep Singh did the rest.
Saurabh Tiwary fell with the score on 141, leaving his skipper with the onerous task of farming the strike as well as batting through the full quota of overs. When on 132, Manoj Tiwary was bowled off a no-ball from Rishi Dhawan, and cashed in on this stroke to luck as he and Saurasish Lahiri smashed 32 out of the 34 runs scored in the final two overs.
North was never in the race once the seamers Ashoke Dinda, Veerpratap Singh and Biplab Samantaray removed three top-order batsmen, including Yuvraj Singh (leading in the absence of the indisposed Harbhajan Singh), by the 10th over.
Gurkeerat Singh Mann and Rishi Dhawan stitched together a partnership of 71 for the fifth wicket, but once the former fell, the climbing asking rate proved much for the remaining North batsmen.
After his resounding success in the Hazare Trophy, Bengal seamer Veerpratap was added to the East squad in the eleventh hour.
The scores: East Zone: Shreevats Goswami c Mandeep b Mishra 43 (61b, 2x4), Parvez Aziz c Yuvraj b Dhawan 4 (13b, 1x4), Virat Singh b Tokas 5 (27b, 1x4), Manoj Tiwary c Yuvraj b Sharma 151 (121b, 15x4, 4x6), Saurabh Tiwary c Verma b Sharma 17 (35b, 1x4), Biplab Samantaray c Mann b Yuvraj 10 (16b, 1x4), Kumar Deobrat c Verma b Dhawan 15 (18b, 1x4), Saurasish Lahiri c Mishra b Sandeep 15 (9b, 1x6), Shahbaz Nadeem (not out) 2 (1b), Veerpratap Singh (not out) 0 (0b); Extras (lb-2, nb-1, w-8): 11; Total (for eight wkts. in 50 overs): 273.

I am Amit Shah who has come to uproot Trinamool  says BJP chief on Mamata s home turfComments
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) launched a scathing attack on West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata on Sunday, laying the foundation for the 2016 assembly elections in the state where the saffron party is eyeing substantial gains.
Echoing Narendra Modi's call for a Congress-free India, BJP president Amit Shah called for a Trinamool-free Bengal, addressing a public rally at Kolkata on Sunday. (ANI Photo)
Addressing a rally that saw a crowd of two lakh people, BJP national president Amit Shah attacked Banerjee over the Saradha case, terrorist activities as well as lack of development in the state.
"If you vote for a BJP government, we will ensure prosperity and take the state forward," Shah told the people of Bengal.
"A few days ago, Mamata Banerjee had asked: who is Amit Shah?  I am Amit Shah… I have come here to start the process of uprooting Trinamool Congress," he added, calling for a 'Trinamool-free Bengal', in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's slogan of a 'Congress-free India'.
Shah pointed out that throwing out the ruling party from the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) polls in 2015 can be the first step towards that “dream”.
The BJP chief's address came at a time when the ruling Trinamool Congress was reeling under graft allegations in the multi-crore Saradha chit fund scam and the October 2 blasts that killed two alleged militants from Bangladesh who had taken shelter in Burdwan.
"Stop protecting Bangladeshis," Shah told Banerjee, "Don't jeopardise the security of the state and the country."
Turning the heat on the state government over the blasts, he added, "Who is Hasan Chowdhury? Mamata Banerjee, please tell the people of Bengal who he is."
Chowdhury owned the two-storey house in Burdwan where a group of alleged Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh operatives were hiding. He is known to be a Trinamool worker.
Exuding confidence about BJP's poll prospects, Shah said, "Maharastra and Haryana have already voted for a BJP government. Jharkhand and J-K will certainly vote for BJP governments."
Shah added the Trinamool had failed to usher in development in Bengal, which is not known for an industry-friendly image.
"Many big industries have shut operations in West Bengal, the youth are unemployed and the... infrastructure is poor."
Reaching out to the youth, Shah said youngsters in Bengal wanted that the Burdwan terrorists be hanged and the Saradha culprits be sent behind the bars.
"I am challenging Mamata Banerjee to declare that those arrested by CBI in the Saradha scam are innocent," the BJP president added.
Trinamool MP Sinjoy Bose and suspended party MP Kunal Ghosh have been arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation in connection with the Saradha case that has sent a shock wave across the nation.
"Mamata Banerjee staged a big demonstration against the Singur factory (of Tata's Nano) that had affected about 1,200 people… But why is she silent about the Saradha scam that has affected 17 lakh people?"
The shadow of Saradha has been hounding Banerjee and her government since it exploded in early 2013. Kunal Ghosh had recently said Banerjee was the biggest beneficiary of the scam. 
"West Bengal needs a government that fights against corruption and does not protect people involved in scams," Shah said.
"The journey of Modiji's victory chariot flagged off in 2014 will come to Kolkata," he added at the rally, for which he was initially denied permission by the Trinamool government.
BJP state leaders had to move Calcutta high court thrice to obtain permission to organise it after the Kolkata Police, KMC and fire services department said no.
The BJP's rise in Bengal has sparked speculations about new equations in Bengal's political arena where the saffron brigade was a fringe player till recently.
However, banking on Modi's poll promises on development, the party bagged an impressive 16.8% vote share in the April-May Lok Sabha elections. Even though the BJP won just two of the 42 seats, it made an impact.
Frequent clashes between BJP and Trinamool supporters have been reported in Bengal since the polls.

Will swap land with Dhaka  end illegal influx  says PM Narendra ModiPrime Minister Narendra Modi said that his government would go ahead with a land transfer deal with Bangladesh keeping illegal influx and Assam’s long-term security interests in mind.
 
Bangladesh stands to gain some 10,000 acres of land through this deal the UPA government had initiated in 2011 and placed as a bill for ratification in Rajya Sabha in December last year. The BJP in Assam had opposed this deal, as did the Trinamool Congress in West Bengal.
Addressing party workers in Guwahati on Sunday, Modi said, “The land swap deal will be beneficial. It might seem to be an immediate loss for Assam, but it will serve security interests in the long term and help solve the problem of Bangladeshi migrants.”
Infiltration from Bangladesh is a major issue in the Northeast. It is viewed as a demographic invasion designed to out-populate scores of indigenous communities in the region.
 
The Prime Minister said there would be no compromise with the security of the strategic Northeast. “The forces trying to destabilise Assam and the Northeast should know that Delhi has a new government and the law will not spare them now,” he said.
Insisting that the BJP brand of politics was not based on casteism, communalism or regionalism, Modi said his party believes in nationalism. “Our mantra of inclusive development has compelled all political parties to rework their agendas,” he said, adding that his government has special plans for the Northeast.

Pre-market: Nifty likely to edge higher on strong Q2 GDP datagdp
(Tracking the momentum,…)
NEW DELHI: The 50-share Nifty index is expected to open flat on Monday following muted trend seen in other Asian markets and strong Q2 GDP data. Tracking the momentum, the index is expected to edge higher after muted start to reclaim its crucial psychological level of 8,600.
At 07:30 a.m., Nifty India stock futures in Singapore were trading 0.5 point lower at 8,625 indicating a flat opening on the domestic market.
India's gross domestic product grew better than expected in the July-September quarter but slower than the nine-quarter high recorded in the preceding three-month period.
GDP rose 5.3 per cent in the second quarter of FY15, better than the 5.1 per cent expectation, but below 5.7 per cent recorded in the April-June period, according to data released by the statistics office on Friday
"Against all odds, Q2 GDP figures have shown a surprising jump of 5.3 per cent, beating consensus expectations of 5 per cent. The overall growth of 5.3% benefitted from favorable base in two sectors, viz. Mining and Community, Social & Personal services," says Dr. Soumya Kanti Ghosh, Chief Economic Adviser & GM, Economic Research Department, State Bank of India.
"However, we believe that the Q2 numbers are on the upside and doesn't explain the ground reality," adds Ghosh.
The 50-share Nifty index finally ended the day with a gain of 94 points at 8588. The Sensex was up 255 points at 28693 on Friday.
The momentum is likely to continue trending higher and has an immediate support placed at 8500 and the index would remain firm as long as 8500 is respected, say experts.
"Positional trades may now trail the stop loss of long positions to 8420 as it has now emerged as a key support for the index," GEPL Capital said in a report.
"If Nifty manages to sustain above 8500 then the recent gains may extend higher and Nifty may test 8710 in coming few sessions. Only a breach of 8420 would be the indication of weakness," added the report.
Overnight, US stocks ended mostly flat in a holiday-shortened session on Friday, but major indexes rose for a sixth straight week.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.49 points to 17,828.24, the S&P 500 lost 5.27 points, or 0.25 per cent, to 2,067.56 and the Nasdaq Composite added 4.31 points, or 0.09 per cent, to 4,791.63.
Asian shares were trading flat. Japan's Nikkei 225 index which was trading 0.97 per cent higher at 17,630 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was trading 1.2 per cent lower at 23,679. China's Shanghai index was trading 0.30 per cent higher at 2,705.

Oil Slumps Near $59 for First Time Since 2009 on Oversupply
Tokyo stocks opened slightly higher on Monday after the dollar rose against the yen on oil-producing cartel OPEC's decision not to cut production.
The Nikkei 225 index at the Tokyo Stock Exchange was up 0.09 per cent, or 15.25 points, to 17,475.10 at the start.
The dollar was at 118.87 yen early Monday, up from 118.65 yen in New York Friday afternoon.
The euro also rose to 147.87 yen from 147.64 yen in US trade, while buying $1.2438 against $1.2443.
A weaker yen is a positive for Japanese exporters as it makes them more competitive abroad and increases profits when they are repatriated.
On Wall Street the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.49 points on Friday, creeping to a new record high at 17,828.24, while energy-related stocks were hammered after the OPEC decision.

Twitter is tracking other apps on your phoneTwitter is tracking other apps installed on your phone
Associated Press     New York   Last Updated: November 27, 2014  | 15:13 IST

Microblogging site Twitter is now tracking what other apps its users have installed on their mobile devices so it can target content and ads to them better.
However, the San Francisco-based company said it is only collecting the list of apps that users have installed, not any data within the apps. It would also not collect the app lists from people who have previously turned off ad targeting on their phones.
Twitter Inc said on Wednesday that users will receive a notification when the setting is turned on and can opt out using settings on their phones.
On iPhones, this setting is called "limit ad tracking." On Android phones, it's "opt out of interest-based ads."
Besides advertising, Twitter said knowing what apps people have downloaded can improve its suggestions on what accounts to follow and add relevant content to their feeds that isn't advertising.

CAG wants $357.16 mn of RIL s KG-D6 cost disallowedCAG wants $357.16 million of Reliance Industries' KG-D6 cost disallowed
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 28, 2014  | 17:05 IST

The CAG on Friday sought disallowance of $357.16 million (about Rs 2,179 crore) expenditure Reliance Industries (RIL) incurred on drilling of wells and payments to contractors in KG-D6 while it pulled up Oil Ministry for delays in approvals and inconsistent parameters.
In its second audit of RIL's eastern offshore KG-D6 block, the CAG recommended disallowing the Mukesh Ambani -run company from recovering $279.8 million in cost of three wells as well as a part of expenditure the firm had incurred in area which was improperly declared discovery area.
The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) in its report tabled in Parliament, found irregular payment of $427.48 million to contractors, of which it sought disallowance of at least $77.36 million cost.
Under the Production Sharing Contract (PSC), RIL and its partners BP plc of UK and Canada's Niko Resources are allowed to recover all capital and operating expenditure from sale of oil and gas before sharing profits with the government.
Expenditure amounting to $160.81 million incurred on account of three appraisal wells was not eligible for cost recovery and had been disallowed by Petroleum Ministry.
However, even after the Ministry communicated its decision, the Operator continued to claim the cost recovery, as seen in the final accounts for the year ended 2013, it said. The CAG recommended that the Ministry ensure that the disallowed cost of three wells amounting to $160.81 million is recovered from RIL and its partners.
It pulled up the Ministry for not approving annual expenditure and work budgets on time and also asked it to develop consistent and uniform parameters for evaluating commerciality of discoveries.
Also, the Ministry was asked to urgently take steps to resolve the differing views of the contractor (RIL) and upstream regulator DGH on the reserve estimates of KG-D6 and take appropriate action to increase production. Listing instances of irregular payments, the CAG said RIL paid Allseas Marine Contractors (AMC) Euro 200 million more for construction of offshore facilities.
It wanted cost recovery of $77.36 million paid for a floating oil production system to be disallowed. Besides, it found fault with payment of $12.48 million start-up and production bonuses to employees, $88.77 million in hiring of deepsea drilling rig and over $16 million in bonus to contractors.
Finding fault with the Ministry in declaring the entire 7,645 square kilometre KG-D6 block area as discovery area, CAG said, Normally the entire amount of $427.03 million would requirement to be disallowed for cost recovery since these activities were not in line with PSC provisions.
Keeping in mind, however, the fact that the exploration resulted in a commercial discovery (D34), it said recommended disallowing  $118.99 million expenditure.
At this stage, keeping in mind the national interest and energy security, Audit recommends that Ministry should accept sharing of exploration cost of only those of the above mentioned wells which resulted in a commercial discovery and disallow the cost recovery of $118.99 million already effected by the operator on the remaining wells, CAG said.
In respect of D29, D30 and D31 discoveries, CAG said the Ministry should disallow their cost in case they are found to be commercial unviable.
It said pricing mechanism for crude oil and condensate from MA field in the KG-D6 block has not been finalised even after six years of production.
The PSC provisions relating to pricing and sale of crude oil and condensate may be followed and decision on pricing and sale of crude oil and condensate may be taken at the earliest, the report said.
According to CAG, the total expenditure incurred in Block KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6, till March 2013 was $10.441 billion out of which $ 9.929 billion has been cost recovered.
Out of the profit petroleum of $1.03 billion till March 2013, the contractor has got $929.32 million and Government has got $103.26 million, the report added.

Record run continues! Sensex  Nifty close at new highsRecord run continues! Sensex, Nifty close at new highs
India Infoline News Service | Mumbai | November 28, 2014 16:19 IST
Market cap of BSE-listed companies hit historic Rs 100 lakh crore mark ensuring it a place among the Top 10 exchange houses in the world.
 
 
The December series began with a jingle as the Sensex surged over 250 points to hit a fresh lifetime high of 28,772. The Nifty also rose nearly 100 points and crossed the 8600 mark for the first time ever. The gains during the day saw the market cap of BSE-listed companies reaching a historic Rs 100 lakh crore mark  for the first time ensuring it a place among the Top 10 exchange houses in the world.
 
The oil marketing companies flared on the bourses with crude falling even further. Commenting on the same, Amar Ambani, Head of Research, IIFL said, "With crude prices continuing to fall precipitously, outlook for India's PSU oil companies is improving considerably. At US$70/bbl crude oil price, gross under recoveries on an annualized basis would be in the range of Rs300-400bn as compared to Rs1,100bn reported last fiscal. With higher excise duties on petrol and diesel along with fall in gross under recoveries we believe OMCs will not share any burden. For ONGC and Oil India, back calculations suggest net realizations will be highest if crude stabilizes between US$65-75/bbl. Higher net realizations for crude oil coupled with increased gas prices will result in robust earnings growth in the next couple of years."
 
The RBI on Thursday, announced new guidelines for small banks and also allowed new players from the telecom and retail space to act as payment banks. The banking reforms, coupled with a steep fall in Crude Oil prices to four-year record lows helped the market start the day on a gung-ho note. The OPEC members in the meeting yesterday decided not to cut production despite fall in demand.
 
Cheaper Crude Oil price is likely to amount of lower inflation in coming days. Hence, in-directly this lays more emphasis on the Central Bank to lower rates in its meeting on Tuesday. The only data to be watched now is the Q2 GDP numbers.
 
The Sensex opened with a positive gap of 52 points at 28,491, and the Nifty jumped 21 points to 8,517 at the opening bell. There was no looking back as banking and energy stocks pulled the market to new record highs in the early trade.
 
Further in the day, the banking stocks, mainly the PSU banks, got another fillip after the Ministry of State for Finance, Jayant Sinha announced the government intention to bring down stake in PSU banks to 52%.
 
In other macro economic data, India's fiscal deficit for April-October period rose to Rs. 476,000 crore from Rs. 458,000 crore in year ago period. The current fiscal gap is at 89.6 per cent of Rs. 531,000 crore of FY15 Budget target.
 
Back to the market, the Sensex zoomed to a fresh all-time high of 28,822, and traded on a firm note for the most part of the trading day. The BSE index finally ended with a solid gain of 255 points at 28,694.
 
The NSE Nifty zoomed past the 8,600-level, to touch a fresh peak at 8,617. The Nifty pared some gains and eventually settled 94 points higher at 8,588. For the record, the Sensex gained 359 points this week, and 828 points in November. The Nifty was up 111 points for the week, and added 266 points this month.
 
The broader markets also ended on a positive note. The CNX Midcap index surged over a per cent to 12,387, and the Smallcap index added 0.6% to close at 5,184.
 
Among sectors the rate sensitives were the top gainers led by the Bank Nifty, up nearly 3% at 18,527 followed by the Auto index up 1.9% at 8,538, and the Realty index up 1.5% at 218.55.
 
PSU banking majors - Punjab National Bank and Bank of Baroda were the top gainers today. Both the stocks soared over 7.5% each at Rs. 1,075 and Rs. 1,091, respectively. The largest PSU bank, SBI surged 5.4% to fresh record highs of Rs. 322.
 
Asian Paints scaled 5.7% to Rs. 746. IndusInd Bank, Kotak Bank and BPCL were the other major gainers, up around 4% each.
 
Other major Nifty gainers included stocks like - IDFC, Axis Bank, Tata Steel, ACC, Mahindra & Mahindra, Maruti, Zee Entertainment, Tata Motors, Ambuja Cement, Lupin and ICICI Bank.
 
In the broader market, Jet Airways hit the 20% upper circuit at Rs. 322, as cheaper crude oil prices are likely to directly impact the company's bottom line in a big way. SpiceJet also hit the 20% in intra-day deals, and was up eventually 18.4 per cent at close. Even Kingfisher Airlines managed to hit the 5% upper circuit at Rs. 1.34.
 
Other beneficiaries of cheaper crude were oil marketing stocks  - HPCL zoomed 9% to Rs. 597. BPCL surged 3.6% to Rs. 746, and IOC rallied 4.4% to Rs. 365.
 
Incidentally, oil explorer Cairn India was the major loser in the Nifty 50 today. The stock slumped 4.5% to Rs. 260. ONGC too was down over a per cent at Rs. 378.
 
Sesa Sterlite shed 3% at Rs. 231. Bharti Airtel, BHEL and Jindal Steel were the other notable losers.

Oil s plight! Can cool towards US$60/bblOil's plight! Can cool towards US$60/bbl
Hitesh Jain ,  IIFL | Mumbai | November 28, 2014 16:43 IST
Considering the scheme of things, we will not be surprised to see oil prices moving further lower till US$60/bbl.
 
 
It is simply unprecedented to witness a cartel refrain from exercising its authority to protect its interests. It appeared that OPEC defied the terminology of a cartel. The group which contributes around 40% of the global oil output could have easily acted in order to stem the recent rout in energy prices. In fact, OPEC at its recent group meeting decided to keep the production quota unchanged at 30mbpd, as large oil producing members expressed reluctance to cut output and opined that the markets will stabilize on its own. There was a divergence of opinion among the oil producing members of the cartel, where small producers like Venezuela and Algeria are worried about the recent rout in prices; nevertheless large producers are bracing for lower values in order to compete with growing non-OPEC output. The large producers had their say, as combined output of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait account for more than 40% of the total OPEC output. Oil prices bore the brunt of the same, with WTI and Brent values down by 31% and 36% respectively on YTD basis. To begin with, OPEC's laissez faire policy amid falling energy prices and oversupplied conditions seemed unfathomable. However, the concealed motive behind the inaction sounds reasonable. The story doing the rounds is that key producer like Saudi Arabia is intentionally bracing for lower oil prices as it wants to undermine US shale oil revolution, wherein producers will find it unviable to extract oil at such lower prices. Intent of the oil kingdom became clear when Saudis announced deeper price cuts for US customers, while hiking prices for Asian clients. Experts claim that about 50% of shale oil is uneconomical at the current prices. It will be interesting to see whether prolonged lower oil prices can bring a halt to the growth in the shale output.
 
OPEC is definitely not a quintessential cartel, where there is lack of trust among the members and there is no punitive measure for breaching the rules of the game. For instance, the cartel has been constantly producing oil well above the production quota of 30mbpd inspite of the fact that output in other nations was impacted by the turmoil in the Middle East. Most of the incremental growth in output has been contributed by none other than the swing producer Saudi Arabia. Saudis have maintained output around 9.5-10mbpd during the course of this year. Wealthy oil nations like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and United Arab Emirates can produce oil amid much lower prices and hence withstand the difficult times. Although members like Venezuela, Nigeria and Iran are not comfortable with diminishing oil revenues, the big members has been successful in driving home the point of enduring the short term pain. The endeavor clearly is to regain the market share and OPEC is ready to battle it out. Although the interests of the individual members within the group are incompatible, OPEC as a group this time is looking at things in a different perspective. A production cutback would have translated in to higher prices; however it insidiously provides an encouragement to the competition (shale oil). Strategic acumen does not lie in boosting prices; it lies in destroying the opponent.
 
Meanwhile, Russia is also not ready to cut output as it cannot afford to do so. Moscow is largely reliant on the oil sales, which is the only source of boosting reserves. With increasing financial sanctions imposed by the western nations on Russia, Oil companies find it difficult to borrow from overseas markets. The only way for the oil companies is to produce more and monetize in order to meet the fresh capital requirements.
 
On outlook, comfortable global supply side equation will very much remain the rhetoric which the oil markets will dwell on. To a larger extent, markets have already priced in the supply/demand dynamics. However, the scenario is evolving as ever. With OPEC deciding to let the market forces determine the prices and the demand equation remaining weak across the globe (barring US), the bulls will very much remain on the defensive. OPEC will unlikely change its output levels until June next year, as it is projecting demand growth to be subdued next year. Considering the scheme of things, we will not be surprised to see oil prices moving further lower till US$60/bbl.

Coca-Cola to set up Rs 1 000-cr plant in KarnatakaCoca-Cola to set up Rs 1,000-cr bottling plant in Karnataka

The Karnataka government has allotted 250 acres of land at Yadgir in the state's northern region to Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages for setting up a bottling plant at a cost of Rs 1,000 crore and creating about 500 direct jobs.
"The decision to allot the land was taken at a cabinet meeting here after the company's representatives Shukla Wassan and Ashotosh Singh apprised the chief minister (Siddaramaiah) of their investment proposal," a senior official told IANS on Friday. "The chief minister advised the soft drinks major to provide employment also to family members of land losers and local people by giving them skilled training," the official said.
The cabinet, which met here, about 580 km from Bengaluru, approved allotting 150 acres of land to the railways at Yadgir industrial area for setting up a coach factory, which was cleared by former railway minister Mallikarjun Kharge of the previous UPA government.
"The railway ministry has floated a global tender for setting up the passenger and freight coach factory at Yadgir. Construction is expected to commence from March-April," the official said.
Kharge, currently leader of the Congress in Lok Sabha, represents Kalburgi (reserved) parliamentary constituency.
The state government also decided to allot 125 acres of land to Bengaluru-based Mphanite Solutions at Yadgir for setting up a manufacturing facility to produce pet bottles at a cost of Rs 489 crore and provide direct employment to 1,160 people.
"The cabinet has agreed in principle to allot 640 acres of land at Yadgir to a consortium of 53 pharma firms from Telagana and Andhra Pradesh, as they had shown interest to invest Rs 1,297 crore in setting up drug manufacturing facilities, with an employment potential to 10,779 people," the official said.
At a day-long meeting, being held by the ruling Congress government for the second time since it came to power in May 2013, the cabinet cleared investment proposals worth Rs 2,786 crore on 1,015 acres of land in the Yadgir industrial area to create a whopping 12,439 jobs.
As the state government nodal agency, the Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board had acquired 3,232 acres of farm lands at Kadechur and Badiyala villages in Yadgir district for industrial and development projects.
"The chief minister directed the district officials to provide power and water to the industrial area for initiating the projects," the official added.

Expect stock & sector rotation in coming monthsenvironment
(There is immense liquidity…)
In a chat with ET Now, Ritu Gangrade Arora, CIO, Canara HSBC OBC Life Insurance Co Ltd, shares her macroeconomic outlook and talks about the markets. Excerpts:
ET Now: What are the factors that will impact the way our markets move now in the medium term?
Ritu Gangrade Arora: I believe a lot of macroeconomic fundamentals are falling in place for India and even the stars are aligning and helping us in the form of crude prices coming off. On the macro front, the pressure on inflation has eased and the exchange rate has been steady, which now allow the RBI to focus on growth.
While I do not expect an interest rate cut, things are looking positive on the macro front. As far as corporate earnings are concerned, I see no improvement. The last corporate results were disappointing and hence, the markets at 17 times look reasonably poised.
Having said that, there is immense liquidity still in the system and if liquidity continues to flow in the market, we might see further upsides from here. But in terms of fundamentals, we are reasonably poised. Structurally, I remain bullish for the next three to five years, but for the immediate future, our market has priced in all the hopes and euphoria.
ET Now: The Winter Session of Parliament has kicked off. What are your observations so far? Do you think the government is taking up some important measures like GST or any other?
Ritu Gangrade Arora: There is a lot listed for this session. I am not sure what all could be achieved. GST is of course a very important issue for India, but I do not think it will be presumptuous to assume that we would be able to resolve it within a month. But a roadmap and clarity as it emerges is all positive and I hope good business gets done in this Winter Session and at least some of the concrete bills that have been put up get passed. But it is a little early to foretell. The session has just begun.
ET Now: Which are the sectors in your mind which could really see improvement in earnings?
Ritu Gangrade Arora: Crude has a significant impact on our micros. It helps us with the twin deficit that we had been facing, be it the fiscal or current account deficit. Needless to say, both have improved and inflation stands to benefit from crude as well. So it has an all pervasive impact on our economy and all sectors.
I also worry that if crude continues to fall, it is not a very good signal because then one starts worrying about a global deflation and fall in demand which is not a great situation for any country. While we are net importers of crude, but we also export to developed economies and would not want to see deflation all pervasive.
So, I welcome crude falling and sectors that will continue to benefit from it would be of course oil and gas and oil marketing companies, but also consumption because as the inflation is coming off, feel-good factor will improve and consumption should come back as well.
 
ET Now: What is your take on the Indian currency and the fact that it is reacting to the dollar? We have seen a fair amount of weakness. It closed at a nine-month low actually and it is clearly bucking the trend because equities are going pretty strong.
Ritu Gangrade Arora: I worry for the currency in 2015. I believe the currency will see a tug of war and we will see a tumultous time ahead. The reason for that is the US economy strengthening. We also see quantitative easing being withdrawn. So dollars will flow back to the US and also, fresh investments will flow to the US with a revival and capex cycle starting there, which means the world's reserve currency dollar will strengthen further from here.
On the other hand, another dominant currency which is yen is likely to depreciate further. QE has been extended, 300 billion more has been committed to it and the central bank in Japan has said every measure that is needed will be taken to bring inflation back to 2%. It means yen will have a depreciating pressure. Euro as we know is facing its own challenges with growth in euro region at tepid 0.2% and euro as a currency will be under depreciating pressure as well.
One will like to assume that China and Korea will be first to react in this environment. Now in this environment where there will be an appreciating dollar, depreciating yen and euro, India cannot be buffered. While our reserves at 315 billion are sufficient and the current account deficit at 1.7% of GDP is reassuring, but I am sure we will also be caught in this movement and we could see our currency depreciating a bit from here. This global order of currencies will change in 2015 and will be closely watched and be a key determinant of flows in the world.
ET Now: In terms of your top picks, what are your sector underweights and overweights?
Ritu Gangrade Arora: I continue to prefer and practice a balanced portfolio approach. I believe in fundamentally strong companies. So it is a bottom up approach there. Having said that, I prefer the banking sector. I like the IT sector, automobiles, capex, infra, but very solid companies within this and I expect sector rotation to continue.
So even in this year, there have been periods in time and IT has performed. There have been other periods where cap goods have performed and I expect that to continue because there is no solid improvement on the corporate result front to have a secular rally in all sectors and index as a secular rally. So we will see stock rotation, sector rotation more pronounced over the next couple of months and hence, a balanced portfolio would be the right approach to play it.

KANO, Nigeria (AP) — Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan vowed to track down the perpetrators of the bomb blasts that killed more than 100 people at the central mosque in the city of Kano.
Jonathan said his government will "continue to take every step to put an end to the reprehensible acts of all groups and persons involved in acts of terrorism."
More than 102 people were killed in the bomb explosions at the central mosque in Kano, said a hospital worker.
The multiple explosions that hit the mosque on Friday injured more than 150.
"Most of those receiving treatment ... are in dire need of blood and we are appealing to people to come and donate their blood to rescue the victims," Dr. Usman Bashir told Associated Press on Saturday.
Hundreds had gathered Friday in the mosque, which is known for attracting moderates, for a sermon in a region terrorized by attacks from the extremist group Boko Haram.
Witnesses said heavy smoke could be seen billowing in the sky from a long distance away. Immediately after the blasts, hundreds of angry youths took to the streets in riots, throwing stones, brandishing sticks and shouting at security officials.
The palace of the Emir of Kano is near the central mosque. The Emir, one of the highest ranking Islamic figures in Nigeria, is currently out of the country, said palace officials.
Boko Haram has not claimed responsibility, but the attack bears the hallmarks of the militant group that has carried out numerous such attacks in northern Nigeria, including in Kano. In September, two suicide bombers killed at least 15 students at a government college and in July, five suicide bombings were carried out over the course of a week. More than 1,500 have been killed this year in the insurgency, according to Amnesty International.
The attack was condemned by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon who called the attack "horrific," pledged U.N. support for Nigeria's fight against terrorism, and called for the perpetrators to be swiftly brought to justice, according to his spokesman.

Haryana: Sisters thrash molester in moving bus as passengers look onHaryana sisters who beat up molesters to be felicitated by CM
PTI  Rohtak, Haryana, November 30, 2014
First Published: 18:41 IST(30/11/2014) | Last Updated: 13:58 IST(1/12/2014)
Comments
The brave college-going sisters, who fought back eve-teasers in a Haryana Roadways bus, will be honoured by Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Republic day.
In a rare show of courage, the two sisters thrashed three molestors inside a bus in Haryana's Rohtak town, even as passengers chose to look the other way.
Both sisters confronted the accused and mustered enough courage to thrash them, with one of the girls even hitting the youths with her belt, for allegedly outraging their modesty.
The entire incident, recorded by a passenger on mobile phone, went viral both on television and social media. It showed the two girls using their hands and a belt to thrash the molestors, who appeared to be taken by surprise.
A case has been registered against three youths in this connection, police said on Sunday. No arrest has, however, been made so far.
The accused have been identified as Kuldeep, Mohit and Deepak, police said, adding that a case under section 354 (assault or criminal force with intent to outrage woman's modesty) and section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of IPC have been registered against them.
The victims in their complaint alleged that they were harassed by some youths in a Haryana Roadways bus when they were going to their college on Friday.
When the victims objected, one of the accused started beating them up.
Not to give up easily, the girls fought with the accused as fellow passengers remained mute spectators. One of the victims even hit the accused with a belt, police said.
One of the girls said, "They threatened us and abused us. One of them touched my sister inappropriately. They started making obscene gestures... After heated exchanges, one of the boys called his friends asking him to beat us up. One of them beat my sister while two others caught hold of me.
"Then, I whipped out my belt and thrashed them. They pushed us out of the bus when it slowed down," she narrated.
Meanwhile, the father of the two sisters alleged that there was pressure from the panchayat that the girls should withdraw the complaint.
SP Rohtak Shanshank Anand told PTI over phone, "We have identified the accused and soon they will be arrested. These are brave girls and we fully support them."

BERLIN (Reuters) - The mother of a German woman killed when Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was downed over eastern Ukraine in July is suing the Ukrainian authorities at the European Court of Human Rights for failing to close their airspace, a German paper reported.
The mother of the victim named as "Olga L." was seeking $1 million in compensation from Kiev for manslaughter by negligence and had begun proceedings in the past week, Bild am Sonntag newspaper said on Sunday.
According to the indictment, Ukraine should have closed its airspace to civil air traffic because of fighting with pro-Russian separatists.
It accuses Ukraine of failing to do so because it wanted to continue to profit from the fees paid by transit flights - which at the time numbered 700 per day and would have earned it several million dollars a month, the newspaper reported.
The victim's mother is represented by aviation lawyer Elmar Giemulla who has argued that under international law Ukraine should have closed its air space if it could not guarantee the safety of flights.[ID:nL6N0RM03H]
Giemulla said in September he was representing three families of German victims of the crash.
The airliner crashed in Ukraine in pro-Russian rebel-held territory on July 17, killing 298 people, two-thirds of them from the Netherlands. Four Germans died in the crash.
Ukraine has accused the rebels of shooting the plane down with an advanced Russian-made missile. Russia has rejected accusations that it supplied the rebels with SA-11 Buk anti-aircraft missile systems.
European governments have so far refrained from openly attributing blame.

LONDON (Reuters) - Champions Manchester City galvanised their pursuit of Premier League leaders Chelsea on Sunday with an emphatic 3-0 victory over a Southampton side who have surprisingly come between the leading title protagonists.
With table-topping Chelsea held to a 0-0 draw against Sunderland on Saturday, victory for City at fortress St Mary's took them above Southampton into second place with 27 points from 13 matches, six behind Jose Mourinho's pace setters.
Tottenham Hotspur came from a goal down to beat Everton 2-1 with goals from Christian Eriksen and Roberto Soldado moving Spurs up to seventh with 20 points.
After a less than convincing start to the attempted defence of their title, City's display against Southampton saw them back to their free-flowing best as goals from Yaya Toure, Frank Lampard and Gael Clichy condemned Ronald Koeman's high-flying side to a first home defeat of the season.
"We beat a very good team," City manager Manuel Pellegrini, speaking to Sky Sports, said. "They were second in the table and deserved that position.
"It was important to have a clean sheet again, they had just one chance in the 90 minutes and that is important for the trust in our team.
"It was close in the first 45 minutes and we continued working as a team in defence and attack until we scored."
SCREAMING CITY
City screamed for a penalty for a foul on Aguero in a goalless first half when Jose Fonte's hefty challenge wiped the Argentine out in the box. Incredibly Aguero, making his 100th Premier League appearance, was booked for diving.
But Ivorian midfielder Toure, so often City's go-to man on their way to the title last season, put his side in front after 51 minutes when his low shot from the edge of the area flicked off Saints defender Toby Alderweireld and past Fraser Forster.
When French defender Eliaquim Mangala received a second yellow for a foul on Shane Long it seemed Southampton had a lifeline but that was snatched away when Lampard ghosted through into space and buried his shot low into the corner after being picked out by James Milner.    Clichy hammered the final nail into Southampton's coffin when he turned the ball home in the 88th minute.
"I'm disappointed because in the second half the beginning was a bit better than the start of the game," Koeman told Sky Sports after his side dropped to third.
"You know that if you do some mistakes you are punished for that. It was not good enough today and we have to realise that. The difference was the quality."
SPURS FIGHTBACK
Everton's Kevin Mirallas produced a stunning strike from 20 metres to open the scoring at White Hart Lane in Sunday's clash between the two Europa League representatives.
Tottenham equalised six minutes later when Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard palmed Harry Kane's shot into the path of Eriksen, who kept his composure to score.
In first half stoppage time, Soldado scored his first league goal since March when he raced on to Aaron Lennon's astute pass and powered a shot past Howard.
Everton applied pressure late on but Spurs stayed strong to avoid their third consecutive league defeat at home.

By Julia Symmes Cobb
BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia's Marxist FARC rebels freed an army general and two other captives on Sunday, paving the way for peace talks in Cuba to resume in the quest to end five decades of conflict.
President Juan Manuel Santos halted negotiations in Havana two weeks ago after the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) seized five hostages, including General Ruben Dario Alzate, disrupting the push to end violence that has killed more than 200,000 people.
Santos refused to allow the talks, which had advanced more than previous attempts, to continue until the hostages were freed. Alzate, Corporal Jorge Contreras and civilian lawyer Gloria Urrego were released in a jungle area near where they were seized in the Pacific province of Choco.
The rebels freed two other soldiers captured a week before the general on Tuesday, meaning all five hostages have now been released. The Red Cross said those released on Sunday were fit to be flown by helicopter to the city of Medellin.
"It's clear this decision contributes to returning to a favorable climate for continuing the talks (and) shows the maturity of the process," President Santos said in a statement.
Santos said he would now meet his team of negotiators to discuss their return to the two-year-old peace talks in Cuba.
In a statement posted online on Sunday confirming the hostages' release, the FARC negotiating team in Havana reiterated its demand for a ceasefire during peace talks, a request Santos has repeatedly said is out of the question.
"It's time for a bilateral ceasefire, for armistice, so that no bellicose happening in the battlefield justifies interrupting such a beautiful and historic process like that of agreeing peace for a nation which longs for this destiny," the statement said.
It referred to the need "to redesign the rules of the game" without clarifying what that meant. A statement last week from FARC leader Rodrigo Londono, known by nom de guerre "Timochenko", said Santos had violated a general agreement stating that the talks must not be interrupted.
"A peace process which has gotten to this level ... cannot be submitted to any type of hurried and impulsive attitudes which will stall the coming of our reconciliation," the FARC negotiators said.
The FARC said a member of its negotiating team, 'Pastor Alape' or Felix Antonio Munoz Lascarro, had traveled to Colombia to ensure the hostages' release went smoothly.
BACK TO BUSINESS?
Alzate, 55, and his fellow captives were seized as they disembarked from a boat in a jungle region of poor and violent coastal Choco. The FARC declared him a prisoner of war.
The two soldiers freed on Tuesday, Paulo Cesar Rivera and Jonathan Andres Diaz, were taken during combat in a separate incident in the eastern province of Arauca three weeks ago.
The government and the FARC have reached partial agreement on ending the illegal drugs trade, land reform and political participation for demobilized rebels.
The speedy release of all captives benefits the rebels and Santos, who took a tough stance suspending the talks, and may for now silence critics who claim he has bowed to rebel demands and that the FARC is not serious about ending the conflict.
Powerful and still-popular former President Alvaro Uribe, now a senator, and his opposition party have slammed the talks, claiming the rebels are seeking impunity and have milked the hostage-taking for press coverage.
The last peace effort ended in a shambles in 2002 when the rebels used a demilitarized zone to expand their fighting force and take hostages.
The process finally collapsed when the FARC kidnapped a senator. The group held him captive for six years.

Sugar factories begin crushing operationsSugar factories begin crushing operations
Gururaj Jamkhandi | Dharwad Dec 01, 2014 12:25 AM IST
Sugarcane growers in north Karnataka got a relief of sorts this weekend with sugar factories in the region starting crushing of sugarcane in the afternoon.
The harvested sugarcane will be transported to factories. The South Indian Sugar Mills Association (SISMA) had directed all the factories in the state to begin crushing the sugarcane, and the factories have fallen in line. The state Cabinet, which met at Kalaburgi last week, discussed the issue and decided to end the impasse.
The ministers held talks with the factory management and asked the factory owners to start crushing. They were assured that the government will help them financially within 15 days. The factories and the farmers have been at loggerheads over the price of sugarcane. While the farmers were demanding Rs 2,600 a tonne, the factories offered Rs 2,100 a tonne. The farmers had even obtained an order from the high court which had asked the factories to pay Rs 2,500 per tonne.
The matter came up for discussions at the state cabinet meeting held at Kalaburagi last week. Minister for IT/BT S R Patil said that the cabinet considered the fact that the fate of the farmers in north Karnataka depended on the sugar factories and that the factories should survive in the interest of the farmers. As such, the government has decided to compensate the factories, he added.
In Karnataka there are 65 sugar factories of which 58 are functioning. The cooperative sector has 22 factories, two are run by the government and 34 are privately-owned. Of the private factories 33 are owned/managed by politicians.
Belgaum district is stands first in sugarcane production in Karnataka accounting for 35 per cent of the state’s total production. With 21 sugar factories, the district produces 13 million tonnes of sugarcane every year, while the total production in the state stands at 35 million tonnes. Bagalkot has nine factories while Bidar has four, Vijayapura, Kalaburagi and Davanagere three each.
Karnataka has 2.5 million sugarcane growers and the government earns Rs 6 crore every year by way of tax from this sector.

AMU VC comes under flak from students  unionEnforcement Directorate probing beneficiary of Rs 425 crore Indian Premier League facilitation fee
Aligarh Muslim University’s decision to hold a seminar on Raja Mahendra Pratap has come under criticism from the student’s union which alleged that the Vice-Chancellor had succumbed to “pressure of BJP government” but he rejected the charge saying it is a “misconception”.
Ending a stand-off, BJP yesterday gave up its plans to organise the birth anniversary celebration of Raja Mahendra Pratap at the AMU campus after the Vice-Chancellor Zameer Uddin Shah announced that the university will hold a seminar to mark his contribution.
Last night, the AMU Students’ Union passed a resolution criticising the Vice-Chancellor’s decision to hold the seminar “under pressure of the BJP government at the centre”.
“Some sections of the university community may harbour the misconception that I took this decision on Friday under pressure from the central government. This is patently false,” Vice-Chancellor Zameer Uddin Shah told PTI yesterday.
“My decision to hold the seminar springs entirely from my intent to highlight those heroes of India’s freedom movement whose contributions have been forgotten by us today,” Shah added.
“The seminar will be be held at AMU at an early date despite some reservations on this move by some student leaders,” Shah said.
Shah had earlier written to the centre saying there could be a communal flagration and student unrest after BJP leaders had planned to celebrate the birth anniversary of Pratap, a freedom fighter and one of the land donors to the AMU campus, in front of the main gate of the campus on December 1.
The students’ union resolution passed yesterday criticised the BJP saying the planned celebrations were with an “intent of polarising society”.
“Raja Mahendra Pratap is an illustrious alumni of our university and we greatly respect and honour him. However, we strongly feel that the decision of the Bhartiya Janta Party to suddenly appropriate this iconic freedom fighter stems from the intent of polarising society.”
President AMU Students’ Union Abdullah Azzam said they were not opposed to the seminar, “but we feel, that the VC is succumbing to the pressures mounted by the ruling party at the centre.”
“We fear that the NDA government is trying to erode the autonomy of this institution. This is something which spells danger not only for the AMU, but for the entire educational system in the country,” Azzam said.
Stressing that the decision to hold the seminar is purely an academic exercise, Shah said, “Even if the students’ union may have some reservations on the timing of my announcement, I will ensure that this seminar is held in a proper academic atmosphere.”

Mid-sized IT firms lap up tech startupsCloudSquads Inc
(Persistent recently acquired…)
PUNE: A bunch of mid-sized IT companies are increasingly buying startups or partnering with them in new technology spaces to diversify and increase product offerings.
Companies such as Persistent Systems, Zensar, Gozoop and Geometricare are working with and acquiring product startups.
"We partner with startups through a dedicated team, have an M&A department scouting startups for acquisition, and at the same time our venture fund arm is investing in startups with innovative technology that has a long time horizon," said Mritunjay Singh, chief operating officer at Persistent Systems.
Persistent recently acquired Hoopz, a Pune-based startup working in the web discovery technology space. Earlier this year it acquired California and Pune-based CloudSquads Inc , an enterprise social apps platform.
Zensar Technologies has acquired Professional Access Software Development, which is into in retail commerce, while global digital services IT company Gozoop has bought iThink Info Tech , which focuses on custom software development for web and mobile.
Persistent has a $10-million (approx Rs 62 crore) venture fund. It plans to invest in more than 40 companies. "We are in discussion with five to six startups through our M&A team and we may acquire them if we feel they can contribute towards the end-to-end solutions we offer our clients with new innovative technology," Singh said.
"Indian companies are doing well in the product space in Internet of Things (IoT), cloud and big data," he said. "Depending on who fits our profile, our acquisition can be from India or the US."
Singh said decision making was faster in companies where the urgency to add new technology is more.
Besides taking over startups, these firms are also investing in them.
Ganesh Natarajan, CEO of Zensar Technologies, said, "We are partnering with over a dozen startups and will expand this universe. And if there are opportunities to incubate or acquire similar players of we would be open."
He added, "In Zensar's case, with our focus on digital transformation, we continually seek companies, both startup and mature technology providers who have point solutions in our focus verticals - manufacturing, retail and insurance."
Krishna Ramaswami, who heads India operations and the digital enterprise of Zensar Technologies, said startup partners with niche solutions are integral to providing digital transformation solutions today. "This is exactly what we have adopted as a strategy. The reasons are quite fundamental because startups are nimble and are engaged with cutting edge solutions in the digital space," he said.
The company is looking to partner with around a dozen startups, and is also looking at acquisitions in key markets, primarily US and Europe, Ramaswami said.
Digital services company Gozoop is similarly looking at acquisitions of startups working in its core area. In July, it acquired web and mobile software development startup IThink Info Tech. A year earlier it had bought social media agency Red Digital.
"Indian startups know how to bootstrap well," said Rohan Bhansali, CEO of Gozoop. "We are always on the lookout for a purchase that can make us bigger and better. We are currently on the lookout for acquisitions in the gaming space," he added.
Bhansali said Gozoop looks for both talent and scale. "Talent acquisitions are made in areas that are not naturally our strengths. Here the biggest assets we acquire are the entrepreneurs along with their teams. Scale acquisitions help us enter new geographies and expand our current client base."
There are 800 startups being set up in India every year and the country is the third largest startup ecosystem in the world after the US and UK.
Seven Indian tech startups were acquired by global players in 2013, and this year global giants, Facebook, Yahoo and Google have made acquisitions for the first time in India.
Sharad Sharma, cofounder of product think tank iSpirit , said Persistent Systems has made a consistent effort to acquire startups as a strategic move. "We need more IT companies to take a lead in startup acquisition. Companies such as Zensar have started acquiring startups too, but for the most part it is still early stages," he said.
Sharma said that for the majority of the IT companies in India, the Global 2000 companies form the top clients. "Their natural acquisition strategy too is focused on the US and UK startups that cater to same size customers," he said. "Indian product companies on the other hand are focused on the mid-sized market globally, especially the US.
Hence, we are seeing the trend of acquisitions from US companies who are serial acquirers, such as Google and Yahoo. This trend shall continue as more product startups get discovered from India," Sharma said.

(Among Nifty stocks, there…)
A spate of disappointing corporate earnings for the quarter ended September 2014, thanks to a slow economic recovery, forced analysts to downgrade the FY15 earnings per share ( EPS ) estimates of about 60% of the top 300 companies (covered by at least 5 analysts). Of the 181 downgrades, 124 are mid-caps while the remaining are large-caps. Stocks, mostly belonging to consumer goods, cement, PSU banks and telecom and utilities suffered the maximum downgrades.
Some of the stocks which have been downgraded include Axis Bank , ABB , Aditya Birla Nuvo , Jindal Steel and DLF. Among Nifty stocks, there were 14 upgrades and 32 downgrades. The earning estimates of companies such as Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki and Sun Pharma have been upgraded signifi cantly.
Analysts said the consensus on earnings downgrades for FY15 & FY16, post Q2 FY15 results, belies current market euphoria. "It appears that the market is setting its sights on the growth prospects beyond FY16, ignoring the current earning downgrades and perceiving lower risk premium on India, given the improving macros, political stability, decisive governance and benign external sector," said Vinod Karki, VP-Strategic Research Group, ICICI Securities. "Assuming lower infl ation, anticipated rate cut, improving consumer sentiment, and investment revival are expected to fuel earning upgrades in FY16."

Petrol  diesel price cut on fall in oil pricesPetrol price cut by 91 paise, diesel by 84 paise per litre
BT Online Bureau     New Delhi   Last Updated: December 1, 2014  | 08:23 IST
Petrol and diesel prices were cut on Sunday as international oil rates continued to slump . This is the seventh reduction in petrol prices since August, while it is the third for diesel.
Petrol price was cut by 91 paise a litre, and diesel by 84 paise per litre, a PTI report stated.
The price reduction will be effective midnight, Indian Oil Corp, the nation's largest fuel retailer, announced in New Delhi.
In Delhi, petrol price will cost Rs.63.33 a litre as compared to Rs.64.24 per litre previously while in Mumbai the reduction will be 96 paise to Rs.70.95 per litre.
Diesel will cost Rs.52.51 a litre in Delhi from Sunday as against Rs.53.35 currently while in Mumbai the price will be cut by 93 paise to Rs.60.11 per litre.
Rates differ from state to state due to differential local sales tax or VAT rates.
The prices of petrol and diesel were last revised downwards on November 1 by Rs.2.41 a litre and Rs.2.25 per litre, respectively (including state levies at Delhi) on the back of declining international oil prices.
"Since the last price changes, the international prices of both petrol and diesel have continued to be on a downtrend.
The Rupee-USD exchange rate has however appreciated since the last price change. The combined impact of both these factors warrant a decrease in retail selling prices of both petrol and diesel," IOC said in the statement.
This is the seventh consecutive reduction in petrol prices since August and third in diesel in rates since October.
Prior to today's reduction, petrol price has been cumulatively cut by Rs.9.36 per litre since August.
Diesel price was cut for the first time in more than five years on October 19 by Rs.3.37 a litre when the government decided to deregulate the fuel. This was followed by another reduction on November 1.
"The movement of prices in international oil market and INR-USD exchange rate shall continue to be closely monitored and developing trends of the market will be reflected in future price changes," the statement said.

President Barack Obama will discuss the situation in Ferguson on Monday with his Cabinet, civil rights leaders, law enforcement officials and others.
The White House says Obama's Cabinet meeting will focus on his administration's review of federal programs that provide military-style equipment to law enforcement agencies.
The White House says the president also will meet with young civil rights leaders to discuss the challenges posed by "mistrust between law enforcement and communities of color."
He'll then meet with government and law enforcement officials, as well as other community leaders, to discuss how to strengthen neighborhoods.
Protests have continued in Ferguson but have been more muted than the violence sparked last week by a grand jury's decision not to indict a police officer in the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown.

Antioxidants could be anti-workoutSkipping meals makes kids obese: Study
Antioxidant vitamins are enormously popular with people who exercise. The supplements are thought to alleviate muscle damage and amplify the effects of exercise. But recent studies have raised questions about whether antioxidants might be counterproductive for runners and other endurance athletes. And now a cautionary new experiment adds to those doubts by finding that antioxidants may also reduce the benefits of weight training.
It is easy to see why people might think that antioxidants like vitamins C and E could be helpful to anyone who works out regularly. Both aerobic exercise and strength training lead to the production of free radicals, molecules that in concentrated amounts can cause tissue damage. Antioxidants sop up and neutralise free radicals.
But recent experiments with endurance athletes have found that consuming large doses of vitamins C and E actually results in a slightly smaller training response. But the studies looked only at endurance sports such as running and cycling, not weight training, which involves different biochemical processes within muscles.
So for the new study, published in The Journal of Physiology, scientists at the Norwegian School of Sports Sciences in Oslo and other institutions, some of whom previously had studied aerobic exercise and antioxidants, set out to repeat those experiments in a weight room.
They began by recruiting 32 men and women who had at least some experience with weight training. Then they randomly divided them into two groups. Half were asked to start taking two antioxidant vitamin pills each day, one before and one after exercising. The total daily dosage amounted to 1,000 milligrams of Vitamin C and 235 milligrams of Vitamin E, which “is high but not higher than athletes commonly use,” said Goran Paulsen, a professor at the Norwegian School of Sports Sciences who led the study. The other group did not take any supplements.
All of the volunteers then began the same resistance-training regimen, consisting of four fairly rigorous training sessions each week. As the exercises grew easy, weights were increased, with the aim of pumping up the size and strength of the volunteers’ muscles. The programme lasted 10 weeks. But midway through that time, the researchers took small samples of muscle tissue from each volunteer in order to determine what, precisely, was going on deep within each volunteer’s cells.
Then the men and women finished the remainder of the programme, at the end of which the researchers again measured their strength and muscle size.
In general, people’s muscles had increased in size to the same extent, proportionally. The group that had taken the vitamins now had larger muscles. So did the group that had not. But there were subtle but significant differences in their strength gains. Over all, the volunteers who had taken the antioxidants had not added as much strength as the control group. Their muscles were punier, although they had grown in size.
The differences continued beneath the skin, where, as the muscle biopsies showed, the volunteers taking the vitamins had reduced levels of substances known to initiate protein synthesis. Protein synthesis is necessary to repair and strengthen muscles after weight training. So the volunteers taking the vitamins were getting less overall response from their muscles, even though they were following the same exercise programme.

Chidambaram asks govt to convince RBI to cut ratesChidambaram asks govt to convince RBI to cut rates on Dec 2

Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram has urged the government to convince the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for a rate cut to boost growth.
Economic growth slowed to 5.3 per cent in the July-September quarter, from 5.7 per cent in April-June period. The growth was 5.2 per cent in September quarter of last financial year.
"Use your persuasive powers to convince the Governor, RBI, that a rate cut is an imperative, if for no reason other than to signal to investors and consumers that the economy will move toward a lower interest phase," Chidambaram said on Friday.
The former minister also said no one should be surprised that the second quarter of 2014-15 returned a growth rate of 5.3 per cent.
"When the government rushed to take credit for the first quarter growth rate of 5.7 per cent, I had cautioned them. All the signs of a sluggish economy were there - low credit growth, a limping manufacturing sector, no new major investments, stalled projects, infrastructure bottlenecks, etc," Chidambaram said.
He said the government should have focused on these matters but did not. "Nor did it use its parliamentary majority and its claim of a 'strong' Executive branch to push legislative and administrative measures," he added.
"Government seems to have been seduced by the rise in the stock market and the adulation showered at organised Indian diaspora events. The problems were identified in 2012, corrective measures were taken and momentum was built up in sectors such as electricity, coal, agriculture and reviving stalled projects. That momentum should have been maintained- and accelerated- in the first six months of the new government. It did not, and the result is poor Q2 growth," Chidambaram said.
The former finance minister said all was not lost and the government could do a few things in the coming months of this financial year and revive growth.
He suggested that government should reiterate the goal of containing the containing the fiscal deficit at 4.1 per cent this year. "It should appoint a head of PMG and unblock stalled projects, which is the best bet to accelerate investments in the real economy immediately."
Chidambaram also wanted the government to identify a few proposed big ticket investments, foreign or Indian, bring everyone into a room with the prime minister and not to disburse without resolving all issues and announce the start date of each investment proposal.

The opening week of the Winter Session of Parliament saw the NDA government deploy diplomacy, tough talk and some gentle arm-twisting
The opening week of the Winter Session of Parliament saw the National Democratic Alliance government deploy diplomacy, tough talk and some gentle arm-twisting — not to mention the might of its majority in the Lok Sabha — to drive home its agenda.
In an effectively four-day week, with work on the opening day restricted to obituaries and introductions of new Ministers, Parliament cleared three Bills. Another three were approved by the Lok Sabha and now await passage by the Rajya Sabha.
The two vacancies in the Select Committee examining the contentious Insurance Bill were filled, and it appears set to submit its report on December 12, making passage of this law a possibility in this session.
Government business apart, black money was discussed in both Houses. The government also agreed to a debate on the MGNREGA in the Rajya Sabha, where it assured the Opposition that the United Progressive Alliance’s flagship programme would not be diluted.
Expectedly, the government had more success in the Lower House, thanks to its numbers, Speaker Sumitra Mahajan’s control of the House and Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu’s conciliatory style.
Mr. Naidu reaches Parliament at 9 a.m., studies the business and at 9.30 a.m., holds a strategy meeting with his two deputies, Rajiv Pratap Rudy (Lok Sabha) and Mukthar Abbas Naqvi (Rajya Sabha), and the whips.
The government had negligible success in the Rajya Sabha.
Despite Chairman Hamid Ansari switching the time slots for Question Hour and Zero Hour, the House could not function for over a few minutes on any day, largely because the Opposition dominates the Upper House and the government is in a minority.

Sebi to launch consultation for promoter reclassificationSebi to launch consultation for promoter reclassification
Press Trust of India | Mumbai Dec 01, 2014 12:28 AM IST
Adopting a key non-legislative recommendation of the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission (FSLRC) panel for overhaul of financial sector regulatory framework, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is launching a public consultation for framing rules to allow reclassification of promoters at listed firms looking to become public shareholders.
The new norms can have a significant impact on the way some merger and acquisition deals are structured, as also in cases involving corporate restructuring that take place due to disputes among members of business families or after settlements between rival corporates.
Some of the scenarios where such reclassification has already been sought by promoters include cases of split in a promoter family, a main promoter selling majority stake to another investor, marriage between members of rival business families and a promoter group wanting to exit from day-to-day operations of a listed company.
While the government is looking to implement many recommendations of FSLRC in days to come, it has asked regulators, including Sebi, to begin adoption of governance-enhancing and non-legislative suggestions made by this panel on a proactive basis.
Consequently, Sebi has decided to frame all its major policy decisions after a public consultation process, as suggested by the FSLRC, a senior official said.
“As the change in process of reform continues ... I have not the least doubt that a large number of these (FSLRC) recommendations will actually see implementation in the days to come,” Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said at a seminar organised by the BSE yesterday.
While Sebi has been framing most of its key regulations after a public consultation over the draft norms, it would now onwards follow this procedure for all policy matters having any significant implications for various market participants.
As part of the new procedure, Sebi would make necessary amendments to its existing regulations governing re-classification of promoters after finalising a policy in this regard pursuant to a public consultation process.
Among others, amendments might be required to the regulations governing takeovers, listing norms and the disclosure rules applicable to listed companies, the official said.
A discussion paper containing draft regulations for reclassification of promoter as public shareholders, which have been finalised after detailed deliberations by Sebi's Primary Markets Advisory Committee, would be soon put in public domain for comments from all stakeholders.
The paper would also detail the various scenarios and conditions under which a promoter or promoter group can be re-classified as a public shareholder.
At present, the regulatory framework does not prescribe any specific criteria for such re-classification, which Sebi feels is required to lend objectivity to the process of reclassification of promoters of listed companies as public shareholders under various circumstances.
One of the scenarios include an existing promoter group entering into an agreement with a new group of investors for sale of a substantial stake and expressing its intention to become a public shareholders after giving away all special rights and privileges enjoyed by them.
In another case, daughter of one of the promoters of a listed company gets married to a family member of a business rival and wants to re-classify her status as a public shareholder.
The other test case presented by Sebi involves a promoter deciding to sell a majority of his or her stake to a new strategic investor looking for a controlling stake, and then retaining a minority stake along with position of chairman.
The new norms would specify whether a reclassification can be permitted in such cases.
The other such scenarios encountered by the regulator include two family members, having jointly promoted various companies, deciding to go through a family separation.
The agreement involves one family member giving majority control to the other and the vice versa, and thereafter one promoter seeking public shareholder status in companies where he has given majority control to the other family member.
There can also be a case where a business family and promoter of a listed company decide to exit from the day-to-day operations and retain only a minority stake without any special rights while handing over the management to professionals.
The norms for whether such promoters, as also in other possible cases, should be allowed to reclassify themselves as public shareholders would be finalised after the detailed public consultation process, the official added.

Indian Oil Eyes West Coast for New Refinery Project
Press Trust of India | Updated On: November 30, 2014 14:29 (IST)
Motherson Sumi's German Acquisition to Be EPS Accretive
Mumbai: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), the country's biggest oil company, is looking at setting up a green field refinery on the West Coast as part of its expansion plans, a top company official has said.
"With the growth in the economy, we see there is a need for green field refinery by 2021-22. After setting up of Paradip refinery in East Coast, we are now looking at setting up of refinery in West Coast region, for which we are looking for suitable state and place," IOC chairman B Ashok told reporters here.
The company is also the second largest petrochemical player having 19 per cent market share.
"We have a 19 per cent market share and we are looking at expanding. We see plenty of opportunities and want to be a strong player," Mr Ashok said.
IOC's Rs 34,555-crore state of the art 15 million metric tonnes per annum (MMTPA) Paradip refinery would be commissioned in phases from March 2015 onwards, he said.
On cost escalation, Mr Ashok said, the Paradip refinery was envisaged originally at Rs 29,700 crore and has now been estimated at Rs 34,555 crore, which includes certain changes, with the addition of a new power plant.
The refinery is capable for processing a broad basket of crude oil grades, including cheaper high-sulphur heavy crudes, which would help the company improve its bottom-line, he said.
As part of its diversification plan, the company is setting up a polypropylene project having capacity of 680 KTA at Paradip.
The INDMAX FCC Unit of 4.2 MMTPA capacity at Paradip, one of the major secondary processing units, is designed to operate in petrochemicals mode to maximise propylene/ethylene production.
The unit would produce 700 KTA of propylene. Based on the availability of propylene, a poly-propylene plant of 700 KTA capacity is expected to be commissioned by 2017-18, with an estimated capex of Rs 3,150 crore, he said, adding that the company sees a lot of potential in polymer usage.
On fall in crude oil prices, Mr Ashok said indications are that prices are going to behave same way in the near term.
Falling crude price is good for the country and good for customers, he added.
"IOC's profits are under pressure but operationally we are improving. With the commissioning of Paradip Refinery, our position will be better."
The company is expanding its portfolio in gas, petrochemicals and upstreams to improve its bottom-line, he further said.
Among new businesses, IOC currently has a participating interest in 13 domestic and nine overseas blocks. These blocks are in different stages of development. The cumulative investment in E&P (exploration and production) initiatives has been Rs 9,860 crore till date, but the IOC is not going to be a major player in E&P, Mr Ashok said.
In the gas sector, IOC sold 3.22 MMT of R-LNG during 2013-2014, which constitutes a market share of 28 per cent in the domestic market. A pioneer in supplying 'LNG by road' to customers not connected to pipeline networks, it includes transportation of LNG in cryogenic tankers by now.
IOC plans to augment its 132-km Dadri-Panipat pipelines. A 5 MMTPA LNG re-gasification terminal project at Ennore in Tamil Nadu is under implementation.
IOC is also a consortium partner for implementation of 4,000 km of gas pipeline projects and is also a joint venture partner for city gas distribution in Agra and Lucknow. Another joint venture for city gas distribution is also being implemented for Lucknow and Chandigarh.
In the petrochemicals sector, IOC is now the No. 2 player in the country. The petrochemical plants of IOC includes LAB at Gujarat Refinery having capacity of 120 TMTPA; PTA at Panipat refinery 553 TMTPA; and Naphtha Cracker at Panipat having Polyethylene capacity of 650 TMTPA. The total investment on these plants is over Rs 20,800 crore, Mr Ashok said.
IOC has been aggressively automating its retail outlets with a view to optimising the benefits for customers, dealers and the corporation. About 6,537 retail outlets have been automated till date and the Corporation has aggressive plans to cover the entire network.

5 ways to stand out in your new job5 Ways to Stand Out in Your New Job
By Hannah Morgan | U.S.News & World Report LP –  Wed 1 Oct, 2014 7:24 PM IST
Print
>
Holding on to a job once you've landed it may not be as easy as it sounds. Beyond performing your job well , you will need to learn to master skills you never really thought about.
Do you know what differentiates the average employee from the one who truly excels at work? Daniel Goleman, author of "Emotional Intelligence: Why It can Matter More Than IQ" has written: "The abilities that set stars apart from average at work cover the emotional intelligence spectrum: self-awareness, self-management, empathy and social effectiveness."
If you are ready to move beyond average, consider developing your emotional intelligence, as well as your skills. Goleman suggests these are the "human skills" that set you apart as a star performer: "confidence, striving for goals despite setbacks, staying cool under pressure , harmony and collaboration, persuasion and influence."
These five competencies can help you survive and thrive in your next role, or even in your current position.
Believe in yourself. Starting a new job with unfamiliar surroundings, customs and people can be unnerving. Don't let that prevent you from knowing your strengths. Remember: The company selected you out of many candidates. Be confident -- not cocky -- in what you know and what you can do. When in doubt, tap people inside and outside the company, and ask for advice and recommendations. Don't make excuses for not knowing the answer, and by all means, don't criticize yourself if you don't immediately understand something. Confidence can be faked until you really feel like you own it. Stand and sit tall. Look people in the eye. And speak with a strong voice.
Don't let adversity stand in the way. When faced with new challenges and setbacks, you have two choices: Give in, or dig in. Remember: There was a reason why the company established goals or you created personal goals. Persevere, and find the workaround. Look for new ways to solve the problem, and consider enlisting help from others. Convert your problem into a question, and listen to the responses you get without judgment or criticism. When you stay committed and driven to achieve your goals, both you and others will know you're giving your best shot.
Stay cool as a cucumber: When deadlines loom or crises occur, how will you respond? Stressful scenarios are inevitable in today's workplace, and coping requires calm and calculated thinking. Give yourself some time to respond calmly by stepping away from the situation. Surround yourself with positive influences -- people who have learned how to look cool under pressure. Emulate their behavior, and ask for feedback .
Work in harmony: Teamwork and collaboration are the norm in the workplace -- there's no working around it. But with teamwork come differing agendas. The best time to address collaborative expectations is early in the process. Get everyone on the same page, and hold them accountable for acceptable group performance. This means communicating openly, establishing trust and being accountable for work assigned to you. You may not be the leader of the group, but you can certainly do your part to ensure your relationships with team members are mutually beneficial.
Master persuasion and influence: Every idea you have and every change you want to make requires you to communicate and sell your plan to others. Persuasion and influence happen best when you understand the motivation, preferences, needs, goals and desires of those you are trying to sway. Rather than push your idea or leverage logic to build the case, start instead by addressing how your idea helps the issues being faced by those you are selling it to. Use sensitivity and awareness of their feelings to win over your teammates. Using this lens helps your audience understand how your idea will benefit them.

Paswan flays Nitish for being jealous of ModiPosted: November 30, 2014 5:28 pm
 
Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan on Sunday accused senior JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar of attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi out of “jealousy”.
“Narendra Modi se jalan ke chalte Nitish Kumar arsh se pharsh par aa gaye hai…agar abhi bhi nahi sambhle to aur bhugtege (Due to jealousy towards Narendra Modi, Nitish Kumar bit the dust and if he continues doing so will have to suffer more in future),” Paswan told reporters.
In the recent Parliamentary poll, BJP along with LJP and Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) had won 31 out of a total 40 seats in Bihar. Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) could manage only two seats.
Paswan, whose Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) is an ally of BJP in NDA, said Modi’s popularity has crossed borders.
“Be it US, Japan or Australia, wherever he has gone recently, people and governments there gave him rousing welcome,” he said.
The Prime Minister has brought a new ray of hope for youth in particular, he said.
On Kumar and JD(U) government raising fingers at the PM on the issue of special category status for Bihar, Paswan said, “Even if the status is given, it is of no use because the JD(U) government has failed to develop infrastructure in the state for it.”
“Special status will be given to Bihar when NDA comes to power and create favourable conditions,” Paswan said.
Paswan also accused Kumar for Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi’s statements on various issues which has generated lot of controversy recently.
“Kumar is behind this so that people start saying that Kumar should return back as CM in place of Manjhi,” he added.
Empathising with Manjhi, Paswan said, “Since he (Manjhi) is from a humble background he talks straight from his heart.”
On the government inquiry report on stampede that had left 33 dead, the Union Minister charged the state government with making officials “scapegoat” for its own faults.
“This is an issue of murder of 33 persons. Whoever is responsible should be booked under 302 of IPC (murder)… efforts to whitewash the issue will not succeed,” he said.
Paswan announced that LJP would launch its election campaign in the state from December 13 with a ‘Rath yatra’ which would continue till the polls next year.

Tackling malnourishment  migration in tribal belt two main challenges before govt  says CM Devendra FadnavisWritten by Shubhangi Khapre | Mumbai |
Posted: November 30, 2014 6:06 pm | Updated: November 30, 2014 6:08 pm
Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has urged the administration to ensure strict enforcement of the employment guarantee scheme in the tribal belt of Melghat to facilitate livelihood for villagers who are reeling in abject poverty. Fadnavis indicated, “The biggest challenge was to bring the employment to their doorsteps.”
The two challenges before the state government was to address the problems of malnourishment and migration. And Fadnavis indicated
that tribals cannot be dismissed as mere labourers. The administration will evolve policy for their overall development and growth in their own region.
During his visit to the Malur (Forest) in Melghat (Amravati), Fadnavis took a rollcall to ascertain the names of workers listed by the forest department were true or false. And also ensured that those who turned up were actually paid Rs 168 per day.
“Is Kadu Suma Dhurve here?” Fadnavis called out much to the surprise of the village woman. “Yes, I am here,” she quipped. Sanju Mavaskar, Ram Kali, Soni Kasbekar, Shruti Ghodekar, Ganu Mavaskar.. thus ran the long list of workers who reported to work.
Fadnavis said, “The purpose of the visit to the tribal belt of Melghat was to personally review the ongoing multiple projects in areas of employment of tribals, functioning of primary health centres, problems related to malnourishment, schools and access to roads.”
While acknowledging that there are many many miles to go to address the problems in the region, Fadnavis indicated, “The government will focus on inclusive development of the region.” Melghat has often hit the headlines for death of children due to malnourishment.
The government also admits, “Lack of nourishment coupled with sustained earning that often lead to migration was a cause of serious
concern. The challenge was to bring the employment to their door steps.”
Fadnavis said, “The malnourishment and migration are issues which will have to be addressed. We will have to promote the schemes
undertaken by various departments that rope the services of the villagers to sustain their livelihood.”
In a clear departure from the past, Fadnavis did not restrict his two day visit to interactions or brainstorming with the officials. Instead, he  interacted with the tribals personally by visiting their hamlets to verify the progress of the schemes.”
“What do you do if anybody falls sick in the village?” He asked. The villagers replied, we visit nearby “arogya kendra” primary health centre located in the vicinity.
A similar enquiry on schools in the village revealed that teachers were irregular. The villagers also complained about the poor road connecting their village.
The chief minister admitted, “There cannot be any excuse for the poor quality work on roads. When the government is providing funds it is expected the who ever has got the contract delivers the results. And if there are shortcomings the authority in the district should not hesitate to take action.”

40 Indian prisoners released by Pakistan repatriatedBy: Press Trust of India | Attari (amritsar) |
Posted: November 30, 2014 7:32 pm
As many as 40 Indian prisoners including 35 fishermen were today repatriated by Pakistan government through Attari-Wagah land route.

TMC nullifies Amit Shah's claim, says Mamta Banerjee too strong to defeat

Kolkata: The battle between the Bharatiya Janata Party and Trinamool Congress continues ahead of the West Bengal Assembly elections 2016. The Trinamool Congress hit back at BJP president Amit Shah and accused the BJP of being involved in the Sahara scam and calling the Sunday rally a "grand flop show".
Trinamool Congress leader Subrata Mujkherjee said, "It's very difficult to defeat TMC and Mamta Banerjee, We will fight taking the people with us."
Earlier on Sunday, Shah took on TMC Chief and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamta Banerjee at her home turf in Kolkata. At a rally in the city, Shah accused her of shielding those accused in the chit fund scam and Burdwan blasts.
#west bengal #kolkata #bharatiya janata party #tmc
Shah lashed out at the Mamata Banerjee government in Bengal and called for a change of guard in the state.
"I am Amit Shah and I am here to uproot the Trinamool Congress from the land of West Bengal," he said.
Shah charted the road map for that ultimate goal by targeting the 2015 Kolkata Municipal Corporation elections which precedes the state polls. References to the Trinamool Congress' alleged involvement in Saradha ponzi scam and the Burdwan terror probe were repeatedly used as ammo by most speakers.
Raking up the compelling issue of infiltration of Bangladeshi nationals into the state, Shah reminded Mamata that she was Bengal's CM and not Bangladesh's. "When the NIA is investigating the Burdwan case, Mamata is playing vote bank politics. She is protecting Bangladeshi infiltrators. She needs to remember that she is the CM of Bengal and not Bangladesh," said the Modi aide.
BJP leader Siddharth Nath Singh said, "In 2014 Madan will have to run away, in 2015 Mukul Roy will have to run away and in 2016 Mamata will have to run away."

Congress hits back at Arun JaitleyAfter Christmas in school holiday row, Narendra Modi govt backtracks
Hitting back Finance Minister Arun Jaitley for accusing it of being obstructionist in Parliament, Congress on Sunday said it exposes Bharatiya Janata Party’s “hypocricy and double standards” as the party had frequently “derailed” legislative business while it was in Opposition.
Terming Jaitley’s charge as “misleading and unwarranted”, Deputy Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha and Congress leader Anand Sharma said that the credit for Parliament’s functioning and passage of bills during the current winter session goes to Congress as it respects the institution as a “responsible” Opposition.
“The statement of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley accusing the Congress party of being obstructionist in Parliament is misleading and unwarranted. Finance Minister wants to be reminded that it was BJP which as Opposition party resorted to frequent disruptions in Parliament,” Sharma said.
He accused the BJP of opposing the Economic Reforms and opening of FDI in many sectors, including Civil Aviation, Insurance and Multi-Brand Retail.
“Arun Jaitley was the leader of Opposition when BJP derailed the legislative business in Parliament in furtherance of its partisan agenda. No business was transacted in many sessions.
“It is ironic that the Finance Minister has now conveniently forgotten BJP’s role and the accusation against Congress speaks of BJP’s hypocrisy and double standards,” he said.
Accusing Congress of following an obstructionist approach, Jaitley had yesterday said the government was committed to going ahead with reforms measures to take India back to original potential of 8 per cent economic growth.
“Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP government are busy promoting crony capitalism and have to yet address the structural issues of the economy,” Sharma said.
Terming Jaitley’s claims of turning economy around and ensuring more capital inflows as “exaggerated and fallacious”, Sharma said that the BJP government “inherited” a healthy economy with both fiscal and current account deficit under control.

CBI questions DIG in Orissa chit fundcaseWritten by Debabrata Mohanty | Bhubaneswar |
Posted: December 1, 2014 4:21 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 6:50 pm
The CBI on Sunday interrogated Rajesh Kumar, DIG of north-central range in Talcher, for more than three hours in connection with the Seashore chit fund scam, in which lakhs of investors in Orissa were allegedly duped of about Rs 1,500 crore.
Meanwhile, sources said that Anu Garg, a 1991-batch Orissa cadre IAS officer who has been on central deputation as joint secretary in the PMO since October 2012, is also likely to be questioned.
Till a few months ago, Kumar himself was investigating chit fund companies — including Seashore — in the state. On Sunday, he reached the CBI office in the morning and left at 12.40 pm. The CBI has so far interrogated and arrested builders, mediapersons, politicians and Seashore executives in connection with the case.
CBI sources said that Kumar was questioned about his links to Subhankar Nayak, a broker arrested by the agency last month.
Nayak allegedly helped the businesses of Seashore and Artha Tatwa by building a relationship with top IAS and IPS officers, journalists and politicians of the ruling BJD.
On Sunday, Kumar only said, “I have told the CBI whatever I had to tell them.”
It is learnt that Kumar’s name figured in diaries, envelopes and other documents seized by the CBI from Nayak’s apartment in Bhubaneswar on November 18.
According to the list of seized articles, submitted to the special CBI court and accessed by The Indian Express, a bunch of 12 envelopes contained the names of some officers and advance payments purportedly made to them. Kumar’s name figured in this list. The list also refers to DIG/SBP (Sambalpur, northern range) and SP Dhenkanal, but without giving any name or year.
Later in the evening, Kendrapara SP Satish Gajbhiye was interrogated for about two-and-a-half hours by the CBI. Gajbhiye’s name came up in Nayak’s diary as SP Dhenkanal, it is learnt. Before his transfer to Kendrapara, Gajbhiye was SP in Dhenkanal district. Sources said Nayak allegedly invested in Gajbhiye’s crusher unit.
According to CBI sources, Kumar was interrogated on suspicion of derailing the chit fund probe.
The 1998-batch officer, the first IPS to be questioned in connection with the scam, investigated more than a dozen chit fund companies — including Seashore — in the past two years as the DIG of Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the CID. He took over as north-central range DIG more than a month ago. As head of the EOW, he was leading the chit fund investigation till the CBI took over the probe under orders from the Supreme Court.
Apart from Kumar, the list submitted to the court mentions the name of Anu Garg, the official in the PMO who was earlier secretary in Orissa’s health and family welfare department.
Garg could not be reached for comment despite repeated attempts. Her husband Saurabh Garg, also a 1991-batch IAS officer who is now in the Ministry of Finance, told The Indian Express over phone that his wife is on tour continued…

New J&K govt to decide on Article 370  saysTogadiaBy: Express News Service | Bharuch |
Posted: December 1, 2014 4:32 am
VHP leader Praveen Togadia on Sunday said that it will be up to the BJP to decide on whether to abrogate controversial Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir if it comes to power after the election.
Speaking on the sidelines of an event, the VHP’s international working president said, “It will be up to the BJP to decide what to do with Article 370 ( in the event it forms government in J&K).”
The VHP has maintained a strong stance on the Article 370 stating that the country needs uniform civil code.
RSS general secretary Bhaiji Joshi, who was accompanying Togadia, also took similar line on the issue of Article 370 saying that the ball will now in the court of the new Jammu and Kashmir Assembly after the results of the ongoing election are declared and the new government is formed.
“We will accept the decision taken in the J&K Assembly,” he said. Joshi further emphasised that the BJP government in the Centre should take all steps to bring back black money from abroad.
“Black money should be brought back to the country,” he said.
The leaders of the VHP and RSS were in Bharuch to participate in a cultural programme organised to mark golden jubilee of the formation of the VHP which completes 50 years of its existence.
The celebration included performance by students from the schools run by educational trusts supported by the VHP.
Students from schools in tribal region performed highlighting educational activities being undertaken by these trusts.

Education dept plans career development training for new govt schoolteachersWritten by Ritu Sharma | Ahmedabad |
Posted: December 1, 2014 4:29 am
The Gujarat Education Department has planned to provide a six-month “career development training” programme to its freshly recruited teachers and head teachers across government and granted primary and secondary schools.
The decision comes as the department “realised after discussions with the educationists that this training will help freshly recruited teachers and head teachers in teaching weak students in the rural areas. This intermediate training is also necessary for the personal development of head teachers and other teaching staff,” states a government notification.
However, it is to be noted that in last one year, another attempt by the Education Department was made to improve the quality of teachers.
Previous year, the department resorted to “punishing” all those teachers under whom the students scored below 30 per cent in the state board examinations.
After carrying out a survey of all government schools across the state, the department identified teachers, majority of whom were subject teachers of Mathematics, Science and English, under whom the students’ results were less than 30 per cent. While three to five increments of such teachers were held back, many were transferred out from their home districts with warnings issued to them.
This was followed by a seminar-cum-training session carried out in Gandhinagar for these teachers with “poor” results. While inputs were taken from them, they were also trained as per their requirements.
“The need for a comprehensive training project for freshly recruited teachers has been realised as the department has recruited a large number of teachers and head teachers in the recent years. Like other professions, apart from the education qualification, practical training is also an essential aspect of teaching. Also, apart from teaching, they need to be well averse with the administrative set-up too,” said Additional Chief Secretary (Education) Arvind Agrawal.
With a budget allocation of Rs 1.66 crore, it will be a pilot project on teaching staff with less than five years of experience. In the first year, to be implemented from 2014-15, 80 vidyasahayaks and assistant teachers of government schools, including a maximum of 25 from grant-in-aid schools, will be selected for the training.
Similarly, for the head teachers and principals, the total number has been fixed as 30 that will include 10 from granted schools. Also, those teachers who are to be promoted as head teachers and principals in the coming three years would be covered under this career development programme.
As proposed in the notification, though Gujarat Council of Education Research and Training (GCERT) would be implementing this training project, it would be imparted through “outsourcing”.
However, Agrawal said that the department is also contemplating to impart this training at the District Institute of Education and Training (DIET) centres. “As our DIET centres are also well equipped, these could be roped in for this project. Other modalities continued…

Vadodara actress who put herself on sale on Facebook says sorry for breaking thelawWritten by Aditi Raja | Ahmedabad |
Posted: December 1, 2014 4:23 am
The Gujarati actress — Chandni Rajgaur — living in Kalali of Vadodara, who put herself “for sale” on social networking site Facebook to treat her ailing parents has no complaint against the government as “the administration didn’t know that she was suffering”.
The story of Chandni and her family members’ agony came to light a couple of days ago when she first posted the Facebook status and later media highlighted the issue.
According to Chandni, calls have been pouring in from as far as Kanpur and Tamil Nadu from philanthropists, but making a beeline at her modest residence in a one-room apartment of the EWS housing scheme in Kalali area are political leaders of Vadodara, showering financial and edible donations for the woman in distress.
For two days, Chandni switched off her phone. There are 167 missed calls and countless messages advising her to refrain from selling herself and asking for her bank account details to provide financial assistance.
“I have written down my account number on a piece of paper to tell the people who are asking for it. Some are also calling me to find out how much I will charge for an hour, but when I put up that post, I did not intend to do it. I had decided, I would hang myself to death the next day, if help did not come in. I am glad people came in and saved me,” she said.
Her Facebook account has since been deactivated by “friends” she has made in the last four days and she has received financial assistance close to worth Rs 1 lakh .
A small-time Gujarati actress, who also calls herself a poet and has won local recognition for being a messiah of stray dogs, her November 26 post on Facebook — “Chandni Rajgaur bikau hai…(Chandni Rajgaur is for sale) — turned into a political circus after making headlines when a newspaper reporter in Ranchi turned to Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren for a comment.
Soren, who is facing the second phase of the Jharkhand Assembly polls on December 2, was quick to ridicule Narendra Modi’s “Gujarat model” and announce that he was adopting the woman in distress who had decided to sell herself on Facebook.
“I will not allow a woman of this country to sell herself for financial needs. I have decided that as the CM of Jharkhand, I will adopt this woman from Gujarat and take care of her needs,” Soren told a regional newspaper.
On Saturday, former CM of Uttar Pradesh Mulayam Singh Yadav, on a visit to Ahmedabad, told the reporters that the Gujarat government must extend help to the Vadodara woman who wanted to sell herself to overcome her financial crisis. However, Chandni said that she has not heard from Soren or Mulayam Singh.
Vadodara MP Ranjan Bhatt, city mayor Bharat Shah, District Collector Vinod Rao and BJP party city president Bharat Dangar visited Chandni with continued…

Gautam Adanis Power Play: Short of cash flows but not on ambitionGovt extends olive branch to Kalanithi Maran's Spicejet, allows ticket bookings for next 3 months
Gautam Adani may be short of cash flows but he’s certainly not short on ambition. The first generation entrepreneur’s firm is among the most-levered in the country but that hasn’t stopped him from borrowing more to buy more.  As one analyst put it, “Adani Power continues to struggle to meet extant debt requirements, but is still not running shy of adding to its asset portfolio”. Bloomberg data puts the firm’s net debt to equity ratio at a fairly high 7.43 as on September 30 and the APL stock has lost 24% of its value in the last six months.
In April, APL became India’s largest private sector power producer, when it commissioned the fourth unit of its 3,300 MW thermal Tiroda power plant located in Maharashtra. The company edged out Tata Power from its spot as India’s biggest private sector power producer, a position that the latter had held for over a decade.
Today, APL has an operational generation capacity of 9,280 MW built from scratch. But, with an ambitious target of touching 20,000 MW by 2020; the company is now on a shopping spree.  In August it agreed to acquire Lanco Infratech’s 1,200 MW thermal plant located in Udupi, Karnataka in August for R6,000 crore and followed it up last week by announcing the purchase of Avantha Power and Infrastructure’s 600 MW plant in Korba, Chhattisgarh for a value of R4,200 crore. If both deals are closed, APL’s portfolio will swell to 11,040 MW.
The Udupi purchase surprised analysts since the asset is mired in tariff-related litigation; moreover the acquisition was made at an expensive valuation. Again, the Korba plant has a power purchase agreement for only 35% of the power generated, under the cost-plus arrangement, to the home state but sale arrangements for the remaining 65% capacity remain unclear.
The company’s biggest asset, its 4,620 MW thermal power plant in Mundra, Gujarat, awaits a verdict on compensatory tariff—the Supreme Court has asked the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL) to re-visit the grant of compensatory tariff. APL and Tata Power had asked for a revision in tariff for generation capacity based on coal imported from Indonesia but state-run distribution firms that buy this power are against a higher tariff.
Kotak Institutional Equities notes that despite including for compensatory tariff, interest coverage remains low at 1.1X with interest costs of R3,600 crore in FY2014. The outstanding debt was approximately R44,000 crore on a net worth of R6,500 crore and APL reported consolidated losses of R1,270 crore in 1HFY15 against a net worth of R5,400 crore. UBS observes that the capital that APL would need to raise was most likely to come from its owners as “external equity funding doesn’t look very likely at this stage.” The promoters could, of course, decide to sell a stake in their other businesses.
Gautam Adani would be hoping the government clears regulatory hurdles at the earliest. The 52-year-old businessman, whose interests range from ports and power to edible oil, became India’s 11th richest individual, according to Forbes magazine.
His personal wealth was pegged at $7.1 billion by Forbes, which said that the Ahmedabad-based industrialist added $4.5 billion to his net worth since 2013, making him the biggest wealth gainer in dollar terms for the year. His business, however, is not exactly in the pink of health.

In an audacious attack, militants shot dead sarpanch of the ruling National Conference on Sunday night in Shopian district of Kashmir near his residence.
Mohammad Sultan Bhat was in his car when, about 500 metres from his residence in Nazneenpora in Shopian when the ultras stopped his vehicle and pumped bullets at him from close range at around 9.30 pm, police said.

Narendra Modi govt should take up Bhopal gas tragedy issue with Barack ObamaAfter Christmas in school holiday row, Narendra Modi govt backtracks
Two days before world’s worst industrial disaster’s 30th anniversary, Amnesty International Secretary General Salil Shetty on Sunday said that the Narendra Modi-led NDA government should raise issues pertaining to the Bhopal Gas tragedy with US President Barack Obama during his visit to India in January next year.
“It is time to give victims and survivors the compensation they deserve. It is time to clean up the site and toxic wastes. And it is time to ensure justice and bring Dow Chemicals and Carbide to book,” he told reporters here.
Dow Chemicals had taken over Union Carbide Corporation, US, years after the December 1984 toxic gas leak from its plant here killed thousands of people and affected more than 5.5 lakh people.
Shetty said previous governments let Union Carbide off the hook by underestimating the number of people killed and maimed.
“The Indian government has to urgently re-verify the data against health records and make the figures credible and in the line with Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and even state government records. The recent announcement by Union Minister in this regard is a welcome move,” he said.
“Most importantly, for three decades, Union Carbide has used USA as a safe haven from criminal charges to dodge culpable homicide. The Bhopal Chief Judicial Magistrate has called Union Carbide six times but because of their consistent no show, has called it an ‘absconder’,” Shetty said.
Demanding that the top rung US officials of Dow and Union Carbide be brought to book, Shetty said after 25 years, only seven Union Carbide India officials have been convicted and not a single American employee who was on top of the chain of the command has been brought to justice.
He said that a foreign company’s disregard for Indian judicial system is outrageous.
“It is time that the Modi government takes Bhopal tragedy as a serious issue with Obama when he visits India on January 26,” the global human rights watchdog member said.
Shetty recalled the US government’s response to BP oil spill in Gulf of Mexico in 2010 where the oil major was held liable and had to pay a whopping USD 20 billion as fine and for the cleanup.
“The double standards are outrageous. If the same disaster was caused by an Indian company on US soil, there is no way they would have got away with it. The US has to show that it treats all human lives as equal, whether you are poor Muslim woman in Bhopal or a US citizen in Louisiana who suffered from the BP oil spill.
“We know that the safety standard in the West Virgina plant of Union Carbide was much higher than Bhopal. It is time to right these wrongs,” he said.
The activist dubbed USD 470 million paid by Union Carbide in an out of court settlement in 1989 for the Bhopal Gas tragedy as just tip of the iceberg.
“On behalf of Amnesty International, I am here to say the victims and survivors of the worst industrial disaster of our times can’t be asked to wait any longer. 30 years ago about 20,000 people died, up to half a million affected. They can’t wait any longer,” he said.

Islamic State made Mumbai  jihadist  clean toiletsAfter Christmas in school holiday row, Narendra Modi govt backtracks
Areeb Majeed, suspected member of terror outfit Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), has revealed the names of the local contacts, who allegedly provided him the logistics to join the group to take part in the battle in Iraq, NIA officials said today.
Majeed also disclosed how he was completely sidelined by the terror group as he had been asked to carry out menial tasks like cleaning toilets or providing water to those on the battlefield, instead of being pushed into the warzone.
“Majeed was today grilled for several hours when he revealed the names of the local contacts, who radicalized him and his three other friends here, and helped them fly to Iraq. We are verifying his claims and are trying to locate these local contacts,” a National Investigation Agency official said.
However, the officer refused to divulge the names of the local supporters here saying it would derail the probe.
Asked for how many months he participated in the battle on the ground, the 23-year-old ISIS ‘recruit’ said he was completely ignored and asked to clean the toilets and arrange water for those battling with the security forces.
He told the investigators that despite his immediate supervisor’s request, the ISIS cadres did not allow him to participate in the battle.
His resolve to take part in the war weakened after he was left unattended for his bullet injury for three days before being taken to a hospital, he told them.
“Only after I begged them, I was taken to a hospital. I was treating myself, but the injury was worsening as there was no proper medication or food available in the camps,” Majeed told investigators.
“There was neither a holy war nor any of the preachings in the holy book were followed. ISIS fighters raped many a woman there,” Majeed said while responding to one of the questions, an NIA official said.
Admitting that he and his three friends from Kalyan underwent training on handling of sophisticated AK 47 and rocket launchers, Majeed claimed the Indians were considered to be physically weak.
Majeed was arrested on Friday on his return to Mumbai after spending nearly six months in Iraq. He was booked under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) on charges of conspiring to commit a terrorist act and being a member of a banned foreign terror outfit, and under the stringent Section 125 of the IPC for “waging war against the nation”.
In May this year, four youths from Kalyan town — Majeed, Shaheen Tanki, Fahad Shaikh and Aman Tandel — had left India to visit holy places in West Asia, but disappeared thereafter. They were suspected to have joined the ISIS.
According to police, the four engineering students flew to Baghdad on May 23 as part of a group of 22 pilgrims to visit religious shrines in Iraq.
The next day, Majeed had called his family from Baghdad and apologised for having left without informing them. Upon returning to India, other pilgrims had told the police that, Majeed, Fahad, Aman and Saheen had hired a taxi to Fallujah, a city west of Baghdad, which had emerged as the epicentre of Iraq’s deadly insurgency.
On August 26, Tanki called up Majeed’s family and told them that their son had become a “martyr” claiming that the latter died fighting for ISIS in Syria.
Accordingly, the next day, Areeb Majeed’s family performed ‘Janaza-e-gayabana’ (prayers for the departed soul in the absence of the body) in Kalyan.

Oil Slumps Near $59 for First Time Since 2009 on Oversupply
Tokyo stocks opened slightly higher on Monday after the dollar rose against the yen on oil-producing cartel OPEC's decision not to cut production.
The Nikkei 225 index at the Tokyo Stock Exchange was up 0.09 per cent, or 15.25 points, to 17,475.10 at the start.
The dollar was at 118.87 yen early Monday, up from 118.65 yen in New York Friday afternoon.
The euro also rose to 147.87 yen from 147.64 yen in US trade, while buying $1.2438 against $1.2443.
A weaker yen is a positive for Japanese exporters as it makes them more competitive abroad and increases profits when they are repatriated.
On Wall Street the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.49 points on Friday, creeping to a new record high at 17,828.24, while energy-related stocks were hammered after the OPEC decision.

Kolkata: BJP President Amit Shah on stopped midway in his speech while addressing a rally in Kolkata as the muezzin's call for prayers was sounded from a mosque close by and said he didn't want to give West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee an excuse against him.
"Let me stop for a while. Let the muezzin's call for azan be completed. We don't want to give Mamata Banerjee an excuse against us," Shah said midway of his 30-minute speech as the azan (prayers) started.
When some BJP supporters started shouting slogans while the azan was going on, the party president raised his hands and asked them to remain silent, reiterating, "We should not give any excuse to Mamata'didi."
When some BJP supporters started shouting slogans while the azan was going on, Shah raised his hands and asked them to remain silent.
Shah's jibe at Banerjee came in the wake of the uncertainty about conducting BJP rally at the city's Esplanade area with the state administration and civic authorities initially denying permission and BJP knocking the doors of the High Court.

Odisha: Cycle pumps used for tubectomy in government medical camp  probe ordered21

Angul: Close on the heels of the Chhattisgarh sterilisation episode, use of cycle pumps to dilate the cervix of women during tubectomy procedures at a camp in Odisha's Angul district has come to the fore.
Taking serious note of the matter, the Odisha state government has ordered an administrative probe into the reported incident of Friday at a camp organised by the health and family welfare department at Banparpal, officials said.
"The district collector of Angul has been asked to conduct an inquiry to ascertain what exactly had happened and under what circumstances," state Health secretary Aarti Ahuja told PTI on Sunday, adding the collector has been asked to submit a report within 2-3 days.

The incident came to light barely a fortnight after the death of several women following botched sterilisation surgeries at a government camp in Chhattisgarh.
However, medical authorities in Angul and the surgeon on duty at the government-run Banarpal community health centre have defended the procedure as "routine" in such operations in most government health facilities in the state.
Mahesh Rout, who operated on the women, claimed that cycle pumps are routinely used in several parts of the state in the absence of costly medical equipment. Adequate safeguards are followed while using cycle pumps and the nozzle tips are properly sterilised before conducting the  procedures, he said.

IPL Fixing: My fate was sealed in five minutes says Sreesanthprint
The Justice Mudgal panel's final report on the IPL spot-fixing scandal has named top BCCI officials.
The Supreme Court has also made scathing observations days after the BCCI gave a clean chit to its sidelined president, N Srinivasan, and IPL COO, Sundar Raman. The BCCI's two-man panel had not found anything against Srinivasan's son-in-law and CSK official, Gurunath Meiyappan.
But the BCCI banned three Rajasthan Royals players for spot-fixing on the basis of a police chargesheet that is yet to stand scrutiny in court. The main figure in this saga, S Sreesanth, banned for life, feels cheated.
Charged by the police for bowling no balls in exchange for money in an IPL match last year, the former India pacer says in an interview to HT that he is suffering because he doesn't have a 'godfather' and that the BCCI took just five minutes to decide his fate.
Excerpts:
Do you think BCCI has done injustice to you?
It's more than injustice, but I don't want to talk about this because my case is sub judice. I don't want to make more enemies. But one thing is clear, I've not been pronounced guilty by the court. I am not bothered about others getting a clean chit. I think of myself and my cricket. There is no proof against me, but if there is, it should become clear (in the court).
Were you not given a chance to present your case properly while deposing before BCCI's Anti-Corruption officials?
They hardly even heard me and decided my fate in five minutes. I was told BCCI was looking into the matter and that I would be informed about the outcome of the inquiry. I had hardly come down and got into my car when I started getting calls from you (media) guys that I have been banned for life. I was shocked. More than anything else, I am not in a position to go back to these people. I don't have a godfather. Whatever I have earned in life is by grace of god. I have not done anything against the game. Whatever I was accused of is based on circumstantial evidence. There is nothing direct against me, nothing has been proved so far.
The Supreme Court suggests there should be overall change in BCCI. If this happens, do you see any hope?
Of course. I am not worrying about playing for India. I just want to be allowed to play for Kerala, or first class or county cricket. I love to play cricket in an honest way. Sooner or later everything will come out. I am praying for this. I just want my cricket back. I am 31-32 now. I just got four or five years of cricket left in me.
How tough were the last two years?
I have gone through something that even my enemy should not. Everything happening with me was insulting, but the biggest humiliation was taking away my cricket. My Kochi ground is just 500 metres from my home but I can't even enter it. This is everyday humiliation.
Are you following the Supreme Court hearing?
Yes. I believe something great will come out. As far as my case is concerned, one thing is clear... I am not even an accused in court, I am just a co-accused. There is nothing against me in the supplementary charge-sheet. My lawyers will argue on January 13. I have a feeling I will come clean.
So, nothing good has happened to you in life since the ban?
It's not like that. I am going to be a father soon.

Taking Stock
CK Narayan, MD at Growth Avenues told CNBC-TV18, " DLF seems to be more certainly putting in a long term bottom. I don’t see DLF making new lows, the lows are in for this particular stock. Very clearly  BHEL put in its low significantly earlier when it hit that Rs 200 it came out with another two-three quarterly results subsequent to that but everyone of those numbers have been less than satisfactory but then that has done nothing to the trend of the stock except to keep it up and fuel it further."
"It might have moved up from its lows and it is not that you can go and buy it at any price but basically I would strongly suggest that one should remain bullishly biased in both DLF and BHEL whatever dips that you get are to be used for buying," he added.

Where crude is headed BELOW 50!?!?
Only about 4 percent of shale production needs $80 or more to be profitable. Most drilling in the Bakken formation, one of the main drivers of shale oil output, returns cash at or below $42 a barrel, the IEA estimates.

5 Terrifying Things About Black Fridayreddit
Black Friday marks the kickoff of the holiday shopping season and generally is the busiest shopping day of the year. Last year nearly 150 million Americans went shopping on Black Friday, spending more than $57 billion.
At Silk , we often create visualizations from data. Silk is a place to explore and visualize our world through data. Recently my colleague at Silk, Alice Corona, analyzed Black Friday mayhem data, then transformed it into some eye-opening visualizations.
1. The most dangerous place to shop on Black Friday: Perhaps the most intriguing of Corona's findings looks at which retail locations have had the most injuries and deaths on Black Friday. According to the data, the largest percentage of reported injuries occurred in a Walmart. This makes America's largest retailer the most dangerous place to shop on Black Friday.
Data from black-fridays.silk.co
2. A year to remember: Since 2006 there have been 89 reported Black Friday injuries. In 2011 a record 46 people were injured during Black Friday-related events.
Data from black-fridays.silk.co
3. Weapon of choice: As toy sales surge during the holidays, apparently so do sales for pepper spray. Pepper spray proved to be the weapon of choice on this crazy day of fighting for the best deals on stocking stuffers. We counted 41 cases of reported pepper spray incidents since 2006.
Data from black-fridays.silk.co
4. Angry mobs: OK, maybe they aren't angry, but they're certainly very determined mobs of shoppers. Since 2006, 19 people have been injured and one man lost his life in a stampede of eager shoppers.
5. Guns:
So much for that holiday cheer. As NBC's Miami affiliate reported, in 2012 two people were shot outside a Tallahassee Walmart over a parking space.

Finance ministry hopeful of 5.4-5.9% growth this yearFinance ministry hopeful of 5.4-5.9 per cent growth this year

The finance ministry expects the economy to record a growth rate of 5.4-5.9 per cent this year as it said 5.3 per cent second-quarter GDP expansion is on expected lines.
Economy grew at a rate of 5.7 per cent in April-June period.
"The growth in the second quarter of the current financial year 2014-15 has been broadly on the expected lines," it said in a statement, after the release of economic data for this period.
Referring to the Economic Survey projection that the growth of GDP would be in the range of 5.4-5.9 per cent, the ministry said: "In the first half of the year the growth has been 5.5 per cent, which is broadly in line with the projections as well as the expectations."
GDP expansion in the second quarter was pulled down mainly by poor performance by agriculture and manufacturing sectors, which grew by 3.2 per cent and 0.1 per cent respectively.
The ministry also said lower growth in agriculture was expected in in view of lower than expected monsoon this year.

Black Friday Protests Hit Walmart:  Biggest Day EverWalmart Black Friday Protests Hit Major Cities With Calls For '$15 And Full Time'

WASHINGTON -- Dirk Rasmussen had Friday off and could have slept in if he wanted to. Instead, the Maryland resident and Teamster rose early and drove to downtown Washington, eager to join a post-Thanksgiving protest against Walmart.
"Our local [union] president encouraged us to take part," said Rasmussen, 58, who works in a lumber and building-supply warehouse. "I raised eight children on a Teamsters benefit package and Teamsters wage. I'm a firm believer in collective bargaining, and I'm very concerned about the security of this next generation."
Black Friday may be most famous for doorbuster shopping deals, but among progressives it's becoming a regular holiday for labor demonstrations. Friday marked the third consecutive year of scattered but highly visible protests against Walmart. Demonstrators, along with an unknown number of Walmart strikers, are calling for better pay and scheduling practices from the world's largest retailer.
On Thursday and Friday, photos on Twitter tagged with #walmartstrikers showed sizable protests in D.C., Pittsburgh, Northern New Jersey, Los Angeles, Long Beach, Calif., and St. Paul, Minn., among other areas. The protests were led by OUR Walmart, a union-backed worker group, alongside community and labor groups in different cities.

Dan Schlademan, campaign director of Making Change at Walmart, a project of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, said on a call with reporters Friday that he expects the number of strikers to be in the hundreds by the end of the day, though the group could not provide a specific number of workers who'd submitted strike notices to their bosses.
"All the signs that we're seeing is that this is going to be the biggest day ever," Schlademan said.
Brooke Buchanan, a spokeswoman for Walmart, told HuffPost that the retailer was more concerned with serving its customers than with protests it views as union stunts. According to Buchanan, more than 22 million shoppers came to Walmart stores on Thanksgiving alone this year.
"We're really focused on our customers," Buchanan said. "We've got millions of customers coming in [on Thanksgiving] and Friday, and we're making sure they have a safe and exciting shopping experience."
In D.C., a crowd estimated at 200 to 400 people assembled outside the Walmart store on H Street Northwest, calling on the retailer to commit to "$15 and full time" -- a wage of $15 per hour, the same rate demanded by fast-food strikers, and a full-time schedule for those who want it. One of OUR Walmart's top criticisms of the retailer is that part-time workers don't get enough hours.
The protest was large enough to draw the D.C. police, who stood at the store's doors and dispersed the crowd after about an hour.
Melinda Gaino, an employee at the store, said she would be missing three shifts this week while on strike. Gaino took part in a sit-down strike on Wednesday inside the H Street store, where she and other protesters sat on the floor with tape over their mouths, calling on Walmart to end what they called the silencing of workers.
Gaino, a 45-year-old mother of four, said she joined OUR Walmart in August out of concern with some of the challenges faced by her colleagues. Many workers, she said, don't get enough hours to support their families.
"This has given me more confidence," Gaino, who earns $9.90 per hour, said of going on strike. "I said I've come this far, so I may as well go all in."
Correction: This item originally misstated the number of Walmart shoppers on Thanksgiving.

Measure your nutmeg carefullySkipping meals makes kids obese: Study
In these early days of the holiday season, as cooks begin sifting through recipes rich in spice and sugar, consider this small warning from toxicologists: Measure your nutmeg carefully.
Of all the well-loved seasonal spices, nutmeg stands out for its long and slightly twisted history. In the Middle Ages, it was used to end unwanted pregnancies. More recently, desperate prisoners embraced it as a rather miserable drug substitute. So, on occasion, have teenagers, some of whom wound up at poison control centres. A couple of years ago, a man in Sweden claimed that nutmeg had induced him to spit at strangers on the street.
“It’s not that nutmeg cases are that common,” said Leon Gussow, an Illinois toxicologist who publishes a blog for professionals called The Poison Review. “But toxicologists do recognise it as one of the more interesting spices in the kitchen.”
As Dr Gussow noted recently in Emergency Medicine News, awareness of the spice’s poisonous and exotic side effects has been around for some time. The spice trade first brought nutmeg to Europe in the 12th century, where it rapidly gained a reputation as a seed of unusual potency, strong enough to fight infection (including the Black Plague), stimulating enough to bring on menstruation, poisonous enough to induce an abortion. It also earned shady credentials for inducing a kind of hazy, druglike high that could include hallucinations.
The effect was potent enough that nutmeg mythology eventually became part of prison culture. In the 1965 book, “The Autobiography of Malcolm X,” the activist describes purchasing it from inmates in prison, concealed in matchboxes, and stirring it into water. “A penny matchbox full of nutmeg had the kick of three or four reefers,” he wrote.
Toxicologists say that description is somewhat misleading. It takes a fair amount of nutmeg — two tablespoons or more — before people start exhibiting symptoms. These can include an out-of-body sensation, but the most common are intense nausea, dizziness, extreme dry mouth, and a lingering slowdown of normal brain function. Dr Gussow said nutmeg experimenters have compared it to a two-day hangover.
“People have told me that it feels like you are encased in mud,” said Dr Edward Boyer, professor of emergency medicine and chief of the division of medical toxicology at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. “You’re not exactly comatose, but you feel really sluggish. And your remembrance of events during this time period is incomplete at best.”
The main chemical culprit in nutmeg is called myristicin which forms naturally in the seeds (and in other plants, occurring in trace amounts in carrots). Myristicin belongs to a family of compounds with psychoactive potential that occasionally are used to make much stronger psychotropic drugs. It has been included in recipes for MMDA. And it is chemically related to another compound, safrole, also found in nutmeg, which is sometimes used in the synthesis of the street drug Ecstasy.
Nutmeg incidents are rare — at least, those reported to the authorities. “We do see a few paediatric cases where parents left an open spice jar where a child could reach it,” said Dr Patrick Lank, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University.
The rarity of the cases means that even though nutmeg information is available online, there is enough information about the negative effects that most people appear to avoid it anyway. “It’s clear that the stories on the Internet have not led to large numbers of nutmeg abusers turning up in emergency rooms,” Dr Boyer noted.
The usual holiday samplings of nutmeg — the dusting on eggnog or a cocktail, the quarter-teaspoon sprinkle that goes into a pie or cake — is not a risk to revelers. In those doses, the woodsy, sweet flavour should simply be enjoyed.
Potent spice
Nutmeg is the seed of an evergreen tree, Myristica fragrans, native to Indonesia. The spice mace comes from a thin protective layer that encloses that seed.
It was known to be strong enough to fight infection, stimulating enough to bring on menstruation, poisonous enough to induce an abortion. It also earned shady credentials for inducing a kind of hazy, druglike high that could include hallucinations.
Toxicologists say it takes two tablespoons or more before people start exhibiting the symptoms — an out-of-body sensation. But the most common are intense nausea, dizziness, extreme dry mouth, and a lingering slowdown of normal brain function.

Off switch for pain discovered in the brainVisa on Arrival scheme to boost tourism in Goa
Scientists have discovered that it is possible to block a pathway in the brain of animals suffering from neuropathic pain, which could have a huge impact on improving pain relief in humans.
The study led by Saint Louis University researcher Daniela Salvemini demonstrated that turning on a receptor in the brain and spinal cord counteracts chronic nerve pain in male and female rodents.
Activating the A3 receptor – either by its native chemical stimulator, the small molecule adenosine, or by powerful synthetic small molecule drugs – prevents or reverses pain that develops slowly from nerve damage without causing analgesic tolerance or intrinsic reward.
As an unmet medical need, pain causes suffering and comes with a multi-billion dollar societal cost.
Current treatments are problematic because they cause intolerable side effects, diminish quality of life and do not sufficiently quell pain.
The most successful pharmacological approaches for the treatment of chronic pain rely on certain “pathways”: circuits involving opioid, adrenergic, and calcium channels.
For the past decade, scientists have tried to take advantage of these known pathways â€“ the series of interactions between molecular-level components that lead to pain.
While adenosine had shown potential for pain-killing in humans, researchers had not yet successfully leveraged this particular pain pathway because the targeted receptors engaged many side effects.
Salvemini and colleagues have demonstrated that activation of the A3 adenosine receptor subtype is key in mediating the pain relieving effects of adenosine.
“It has long been appreciated that harnessing the potent pain-killing effects of adenosine could provide a breakthrough step towards an effective treatment for chronic pain,” Salvemini said.
“Our findings suggest that this goal may be achieved by focusing future work on the A3AR pathway, in particular, as its activation provides robust pain reduction across several types of pain,” said Salvemini.
The research was published in the journal Brain.

BCCI offers help to 'speed up healing process'
The BCCI has offered an informal interaction between some of the Indian cricketers and their Australian counterparts, in order to help the players recover from the tragedy of Phillip Hughes' death.

The BCCI has offered an informal interaction between some of the Indian cricketers and their Australian counterparts, in order to help the players recover from the tragedy of Phillip Hughes ' death.
Virat Kohli at a Phil Hughes memorial outside the Adelaide Oval.With Hughes' funeral on Wednesday, the Brisbane Test which was originally scheduled to start on Thursday has been postponed. It is possible that the opening Test could be pushed back by three days and then the scheduled nine-day break between the second and third Test be cut down to four days.
Many Indian players have been in touch with their friends in the Australian cricket fraternity following the unfortunate incident, and the BCCI is understood to have informed Cricket Australia that the board would be willing to go the extra mile to "speed up the healing process".
"If some of our boys mingling with the Australian players is going to help them get back on track, we will immediately facilitate it," a board insider told ESPNcricinfo.
The BCCI has also passed a message to all the members of the squad that anyone who wishes to attend Hughes' funeral would be able to do so. Some of the India players, including those with Mumbai Indians - the IPL team Hughes was a part of - and some of those who toured Australia with the India A side, were friends with Hughes. If those players would like to pay their tributes to Hughes, the Board, according to an official, "will facilitate the trip to Macksville". However, the full squad is unlikely to go down to Macksville.
Meanwhile, the BCCI expects the reworked Test series itinerary to be finalised in the next 24 hours. CA officials informed the BCCI during discussions on Saturday that the new schedule will be confirmed on Sunday after their deliberations with various stakeholders, and most importantly, with the players.

Modi slips to second spot in Times Person of the Year pollModi slips to second spot in Time’s ‘Person of the Year’ poll
PTI
PTI Narendra Modi
Washington, Nov 30:  
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has slipped to the second place in Time magazine’s ‘Person of the Year’ poll with the Ferguson protesters surging ahead of him in a vote by the readers.
According to the latest reports, Modi is leading second with 9.8 per cent of the total votes polled so far, while the Ferguson protesters are leading with 10.8 per cent of the votes.
Joshua Wong, face of the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement, is placed third.
Nobel Peace prize winner Malala Yousafzai (5.3 per cent) and Russian President Vladimir Putin are placed fourth and fifth respectively.
US President Barack Obama is placed at a distant 11th position with just 2.4 per cent of the total votes.
The annual poll, which is currently underway, is scheduled to end on December 6 and the poll’s winner will be announced on December 8.
However, it is the Time’s editors who will choose the Person of the Year, which is scheduled to be announced on December 10.
Till November 26, Modi was leading the polls with 11.1 per cent of the total votes, while Ferguson protesters with 8.8 per cent were ranked second.
But support for Ferguson protesters surged after a recent grand jury’s decision of not to indict a white police officer who fatally shot an unarmed black man which caused an outcry across the US.
“Ferguson protesters surged ahead this week of the leader of the world’s largest democracy,” Time magazine said yesterday in a story titled ‘Modi Drops From Lead in TIME’s Person of the Year Poll.’
“Modi, the newly elected Indian Prime Minister and leader of the largest democracy in the world, has raised high hopes among Indians that he can invigorate the country’s economy and cut bureaucratic red tape that has slowed development in India,” the magazine said.

Volatility is on the cards next week as stock markets take cues from the much-awaited RBI policy meet, developments in Parliament and economic indicators, including monthly auto sales, say experts. 
Shares, which have logged new highs in the past few sessions, will immediately react to GDP data that was released after markets closed on Friday. 
Economic growth fell to 5.3 percent in the second quarter compared to 5.7 percent in the June quarter. This has raised the clamour for a rate cut by the RBI in its December 2 policy review meeting.
"We believe the ongoing positivity will extend further and index will touch newer high in this week. However, things won't be easy for traders as volatility may continue to surprise due to list of events and data," said Jayant Manglik, President Retail Distribution, Religare Securities Limited. 
The release of HSBC manufacturing PMI data for November on Monday and HSBC India services PMI on Wednesday would also help shape directions.
Additionally, markets would be keeping a close eye on auto stocks as these companies would be unveiling their monthly sales figures. 
"Markets are hoping for a rate cut in the RBI policy meeting this week," said Dipen Shah, Head of Private Client Group Research, Kotak Securities. 
Besides, investors would also track the ongoing winter session of Parliament amid expectations of more reforms. 
"Movement of index in near-term will consistently remain on further reform initiatives to be taken in the ongoing winter session of Parliament, much awaited RBI's monetary policy on Tuesday and auto sales numbers in start of the month," said Vivek Gupta, CMT - Director Research, CapitalVia Global Research Limited.
Over the past week, the BSE benchmark Sensex gained 359.36 points to settle at 28,693.99. The index hit its all-time high of 28,822.37 on November 28. 
Globally, European Central Bank (ECB) will meet on December 4 to discuss monetary policy. Hopes are high that ECB would unveil more stimulus depending on economic conditions.
The US nonfarm payrolls report for November will be out in the US on December 5.

Hero MotoCorp Plans to Set Up Manufacturing Plants in Brazil, Argentina
Press Trust of India | Updated On: November 30, 2014 19:47 (IST)
Motherson Sumi's German Acquisition to Be EPS Accretive
Bogota, Colombia: Eyeing aggressive expansion in Central and Latin America, Hero MotoCorp, India's largest two-wheeler maker, plans to set up manufacturing units in Brazil and Argentina, even as it expects an upcoming plant in Colombia to help widen its reach in the region.
"We believe that the factory in Colombia will be a good hub for supply to other markets for us in Central and Latin America," Hero MotoCorp managing director and CEO Pawan Munjal told PTI.
"We will get into manufacturing in Brazil. Argentina also requires us to manufacture locally, which is also on the cards. We would like to enter the Brazilian market along with the Rio Olympics in 2016," he added.
Hero MotoCorp launched six of its best-selling bikes here as part of its target to clock 1.2 million unit sales from global business by 2020.
The two-wheelers rolled out include 100 cc motorbikes Splendor iSmart, Eco Deluxe, and Passion-Pro, the 125 cc Glamour, the 150 cc Hunk and the 225 cc Karizma ZMR. The bikes will be sold in 120 outlets spread across the country.
In July, the company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary in Colombia and commenced construction of a state of the art manufacturing plant in the country.
The project entails investment of $70 million in capital expenditure as well as working capital over a three year period, he added.
"In the first phase we are going for manufacturing 75,000 to 80,000 units in annual capacity, going up to 1,50,000 units in next phase," Mr Munjal said on the upcoming Colombia unit.
With this, the New Delhi-headquartered Hero MotoCorp will be the first Indian two-wheeler company to have a manufacturing plant in Latin America. The plant in Colombia is expected to go on stream by the middle of 2015.
Mr Munjal said the company is looking to establish manufacturing and assembly units in 50 countries worldwide as part of its global expansion plans.
By 2020, the company aims to be in over 50 countries with 20 plus assembly facilities globally.

Mumbai, Nov 28:  
The Appellate Tribunal for Electricity has said it is in the interest of consumers of Tata Power and R-Infra that the changeover consumers of Tata Power continue to get supply from Tata Power on R-Infra’s network even if a 33/22 kV sub-station of Tata Power is available in the vicinity.
It will also be convenient and economical for the consumers to changeover back to R-Infra, in case, R-Infra’s tariff becomes more attractive in future.
This refers to charges against Tata Power that it was choosing its consumers from the neighbouring network and resorting to ‘cherry picking’.
In Mumbai, consumers can choose the power distribution utility they prefer.
APTEL also observed that it is legal for consumers to changeover from one licensee to another using the network of one of the licensees. Regarding changeover to Tata power using R-Infra’s network, the tribunal said R-Infra is entitled to charge changeover consumers wheeling charges and other compensatory charges as decided by the regulator (Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission from time to time.
APTEL also said it is practically difficult to lay a parallel network in Mumbai as pointed out by Tata Power. There are certain directions given by the Tribunal in the order regarding restriction of rollout plan of Tata Power only to the areas where laying down of parallel network will improve the reliability of supply. However, there shall be no restriction on any licensee to lay a network to supply to new connections.
APTEL also directed the state regulator to decide the detailed protocol for switchover and changeover after hearing all the parties concerned.
Responding to the APTEL order, a Reliance Energy spokesperson said, “The recent judgments of APTEL upholds RInfra’s stand to protect low-end consumers. APTEL has also confirmed that high-end consumers supplied by TPC ( Tata Power) need to pay cross subsidy surcharge and Regulatory Assets which would create a level-playing field and protect the interest of low-end consumers. APTEL has restrained TPC on laying network. This will protect interest of 23 lacs low-end consumers in suburbs of Mumbai.”

SpiceJet may delay paying November salary by 1-3 daysSpiceJet may delay paying November salary by 1-3 days

New Delhi, November 30:  
There will be a delay of one-three days in the payment of November salaries for SpiceJet employees. Confirming the development, sources in the airline said that the staff was fully behind the management.
An airline staffer who BusinessLine spoke to did not seem unduly worried about the development pointing out that during November the month ended on Sunday, which is a bank holiday. “When the going is good the company has paid us even on 27th if the last day of the month is on a holiday.
“We know the attempts being made to get a new investor and are not unduly worried as yet about a slight delay in salaries,” the employee who is not allowed to speak to the media said.
Rival airlines also did attach too much significance in SpiceJet’s delay in paying its salaries. “Airlines are faced with liquidity issues at the end of every month as they have to meet statutory commitments like having to pay service tax that has been collected on the sale of air tickets on a particular date at the end of every month,” an official of a rival airline said.
An official of another rival airline added, “With the prices of aviation turbine fuel, which accounts for 40-45 per cent of operating costs for most domestic airlines, declining substantially it will give breathing space to not only SpiceJet but the entire domestic airline industry.”

Committee for revamp of forest clearanceCommittee for revamp of forest clearance
Somesh Jha | New Delhi Dec 01, 2014 12:31 AM IST
The T S R Subramanian committee has recommended a massive revamp of various forest laws, to expedite the processing of industrial applications.
These range from the way forests are defined to cutting the procedures in attaining forest clearance for industrial projects.
At present, three laws - Indian Forests Act (IFA) of 1927, Forest Conservation Act (FCA) of 1980 and the Wildlife Protection Act (WPA) of 1972 - govern these matters.
Definition
The panel has said a forest should be defined as an area so notified under the IFA with the government record and not include plantations grown on private land. "Forest should not include any plantation raised on private land by any individual or agency," is one recommendation. Roadside plantations might also come out of the ambit of being declared part of a forest.
This might encourage private plantations, the panel saying individuals were reluctant to grow plants on their private land.
On FCA
The primary step in filing a forest clearance proposal is to attach a topographic map with the application. "As this (map) is treated as classified by the Survey of India, it takes time to obtain this," the committee noted. It has suggested a project developer be allowed to attach geo-referenced maps marking the area in which the project has to be set up. This may be had directly from the Forest Survey of India's website. It will also reduce the time for a forest officer (FO) to examine the proposal (two months is presently given for this).
After this, according to the present rules, a project developer makes a wildlife plan, on the details of managing wildlife and impact of industries in the near vicinity. The committee said as this was a process taking two months, regional wildlife plans should be prepared by the state governments instead, as a project developer would require official assistance to formulate a plan, a tedious task.
After this, the FO carries out physical verification for enumeration and marking of trees, to avoid illicit felling during setting up of a factory. The panel says enumeration can be done at a later stage of the proposal, rather than at the primary level. "As this process of field verification involving ground-truthing appears unavoidable, it is suggested the enumeration not hold up processing of the application. Once first-stage approval is received, enumeration of trees can be taken up. This process could be speeded by outsourcing this function to an agency under the supervision of the District FO," said the panel.
After the FO examines all these documents, the file is moved to the principal chief conservator of forests, who forwards this to the Union ministry of environment and forests.
FRA relaxation
A project developer is bound to produce a certificate showing all the claims and settlement processes of forest dwellers has been duly filed and processed under the FRA. The panel notes many applications are not accompanied by such a certificate and a large number of cases are pending with MoEF. It suggests first-stage approval do not require such certification.
"The certificate under the FR Act can be provided/ obtained during the prescribed period for compliance with the conditions of first stage clearance," the panel said. Also, in cases of linear projects, the panel suggests doing away with the need for formal approval from the gram sabhas concerned.

My fate was sealed in five minutes: Sreesanthprint
The Justice Mudgal panel's final report on the IPL spot-fixing scandal has named top BCCI officials.
The Supreme Court has also made scathing observations days after the BCCI gave a clean chit to its sidelined president, N Srinivasan, and IPL COO, Sundar Raman. The BCCI's two-man panel had not found anything against Srinivasan's son-in-law and CSK official, Gurunath Meiyappan.
But the BCCI banned three Rajasthan Royals players for spot-fixing on the basis of a police chargesheet that is yet to stand scrutiny in court. The main figure in this saga, S Sreesanth, banned for life, feels cheated.
Charged by the police for bowling no balls in exchange for money in an IPL match last year, the former India pacer says in an interview to HT that he is suffering because he doesn't have a 'godfather' and that the BCCI took just five minutes to decide his fate.
Excerpts:
Do you think BCCI has done injustice to you?
It's more than injustice, but I don't want to talk about this because my case is sub judice. I don't want to make more enemies. But one thing is clear, I've not been pronounced guilty by the court. I am not bothered about others getting a clean chit. I think of myself and my cricket. There is no proof against me, but if there is, it should become clear (in the court).
Were you not given a chance to present your case properly while deposing before BCCI's Anti-Corruption officials?
They hardly even heard me and decided my fate in five minutes. I was told BCCI was looking into the matter and that I would be informed about the outcome of the inquiry. I had hardly come down and got into my car when I started getting calls from you (media) guys that I have been banned for life. I was shocked. More than anything else, I am not in a position to go back to these people. I don't have a godfather. Whatever I have earned in life is by grace of god. I have not done anything against the game. Whatever I was accused of is based on circumstantial evidence. There is nothing direct against me, nothing has been proved so far.
The Supreme Court suggests there should be overall change in BCCI. If this happens, do you see any hope?
Of course. I am not worrying about playing for India. I just want to be allowed to play for Kerala, or first class or county cricket. I love to play cricket in an honest way. Sooner or later everything will come out. I am praying for this. I just want my cricket back. I am 31-32 now. I just got four or five years of cricket left in me.
How tough were the last two years?
I have gone through something that even my enemy should not. Everything happening with me was insulting, but the biggest humiliation was taking away my cricket. My Kochi ground is just 500 metres from my home but I can't even enter it. This is everyday humiliation.
Are you following the Supreme Court hearing?
Yes. I believe something great will come out. As far as my case is concerned, one thing is clear... I am not even an accused in court, I am just a co-accused. There is nothing against me in the supplementary charge-sheet. My lawyers will argue on January 13. I have a feeling I will come clean.
So, nothing good has happened to you in life since the ban?
It's not like that. I am going to be a father soon.

New J&K govt to decide on Article 370  says TogadiaBy: Express News Service | Bharuch |
Posted: December 1, 2014 4:32 am
VHP leader Praveen Togadia on Sunday said that it will be up to the BJP to decide on whether to abrogate controversial Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir if it comes to power after the election.
Speaking on the sidelines of an event, the VHP’s international working president said, “It will be up to the BJP to decide what to do with Article 370 ( in the event it forms government in J&K).”
The VHP has maintained a strong stance on the Article 370 stating that the country needs uniform civil code.
RSS general secretary Bhaiji Joshi, who was accompanying Togadia, also took similar line on the issue of Article 370 saying that the ball will now in the court of the new Jammu and Kashmir Assembly after the results of the ongoing election are declared and the new government is formed.
“We will accept the decision taken in the J&K Assembly,” he said. Joshi further emphasised that the BJP government in the Centre should take all steps to bring back black money from abroad.
“Black money should be brought back to the country,” he said.

Education dept plans career development training for new govt school teachersWritten by Ritu Sharma | Ahmedabad |
Posted: December 1, 2014 4:29 am
The Gujarat Education Department has planned to provide a six-month “career development training” programme to its freshly recruited teachers and head teachers across government and granted primary and secondary schools.
The decision comes as the department “realised after discussions with the educationists that this training will help freshly recruited teachers and head teachers in teaching weak students in the rural areas. This intermediate training is also necessary for the personal development of head teachers and other teaching staff,” states a government notification.
However, it is to be noted that in last one year, another attempt by the Education Department was made to improve the quality of teachers.
Previous year, the department resorted to “punishing” all those teachers under whom the students scored below 30 per cent in the state board examinations.
After carrying out a survey of all government schools across the state, the department identified teachers, majority of whom were subject teachers of Mathematics, Science and English, under whom the students’ results were less than 30 per cent. While three to five increments of such teachers were held back, many were transferred out from their home districts with warnings issued to them.
This was followed by a seminar-cum-training session carried out in Gandhinagar for these teachers with “poor” results. While inputs were taken from them, they were also trained as per their requirements.
“The need for a comprehensive training project for freshly recruited teachers has been realised as the department has recruited a large number of teachers and head teachers in the recent years. Like other professions, apart from the education qualification, practical training is also an essential aspect of teaching. Also, apart from teaching, they need to be well averse with the administrative set-up too,” said Additional Chief Secretary (Education) Arvind Agrawal.
With a budget allocation of Rs 1.66 crore, it will be a pilot project on teaching staff with less than five years of experience. In the first year, to be implemented from 2014-15, 80 vidyasahayaks and assistant teachers of government schools, including a maximum of 25 from grant-in-aid schools, will be selected for the training.
Similarly, for the head teachers and principals, the total number has been fixed as 30 that will include 10 from granted schools. Also, those teachers who are to be promoted as head teachers and principals in the coming three years would be covered under this career development programme.
As proposed in the notification, though Gujarat Council of Education Research and Training (GCERT) would be implementing this training project, it would be imparted through “outsourcing”.
However, Agrawal said that the department is also contemplating to impart this training at the District Institute of Education and Training (DIET) centres. “As our DIET centres are also well equipped, these could be roped in for this project. Other modalities continued…

Vadodara actress who put herself on sale on Facebook says sorry for breaking the lawWritten by Aditi Raja | Ahmedabad |
Posted: December 1, 2014 4:23 am
The Gujarati actress — Chandni Rajgaur — living in Kalali of Vadodara, who put herself “for sale” on social networking site Facebook to treat her ailing parents has no complaint against the government as “the administration didn’t know that she was suffering”.
The story of Chandni and her family members’ agony came to light a couple of days ago when she first posted the Facebook status and later media highlighted the issue.
According to Chandni, calls have been pouring in from as far as Kanpur and Tamil Nadu from philanthropists, but making a beeline at her modest residence in a one-room apartment of the EWS housing scheme in Kalali area are political leaders of Vadodara, showering financial and edible donations for the woman in distress.
For two days, Chandni switched off her phone. There are 167 missed calls and countless messages advising her to refrain from selling herself and asking for her bank account details to provide financial assistance.
“I have written down my account number on a piece of paper to tell the people who are asking for it. Some are also calling me to find out how much I will charge for an hour, but when I put up that post, I did not intend to do it. I had decided, I would hang myself to death the next day, if help did not come in. I am glad people came in and saved me,” she said.
Her Facebook account has since been deactivated by “friends” she has made in the last four days and she has received financial assistance close to worth Rs 1 lakh .
A small-time Gujarati actress, who also calls herself a poet and has won local recognition for being a messiah of stray dogs, her November 26 post on Facebook — “Chandni Rajgaur bikau hai…(Chandni Rajgaur is for sale) — turned into a political circus after making headlines when a newspaper reporter in Ranchi turned to Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren for a comment.
Soren, who is facing the second phase of the Jharkhand Assembly polls on December 2, was quick to ridicule Narendra Modi’s “Gujarat model” and announce that he was adopting the woman in distress who had decided to sell herself on Facebook.
“I will not allow a woman of this country to sell herself for financial needs. I have decided that as the CM of Jharkhand, I will adopt this woman from Gujarat and take care of her needs,” Soren told a regional newspaper.
On Saturday, former CM of Uttar Pradesh Mulayam Singh Yadav, on a visit to Ahmedabad, told the reporters that the Gujarat government must extend help to the Vadodara woman who wanted to sell herself to overcome her financial crisis. However, Chandni said that she has not heard from Soren or Mulayam Singh.
Vadodara MP Ranjan Bhatt, city mayor Bharat Shah, District Collector Vinod Rao and BJP party city president Bharat Dangar visited Chandni with continued…

CBI questions DIG in Orissa chit fund caseWritten by Debabrata Mohanty | Bhubaneswar |
Posted: December 1, 2014 4:21 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 6:50 pm
The CBI on Sunday interrogated Rajesh Kumar, DIG of north-central range in Talcher, for more than three hours in connection with the Seashore chit fund scam, in which lakhs of investors in Orissa were allegedly duped of about Rs 1,500 crore.
Meanwhile, sources said that Anu Garg, a 1991-batch Orissa cadre IAS officer who has been on central deputation as joint secretary in the PMO since October 2012, is also likely to be questioned.
Till a few months ago, Kumar himself was investigating chit fund companies — including Seashore — in the state. On Sunday, he reached the CBI office in the morning and left at 12.40 pm. The CBI has so far interrogated and arrested builders, mediapersons, politicians and Seashore executives in connection with the case.
CBI sources said that Kumar was questioned about his links to Subhankar Nayak, a broker arrested by the agency last month.
Nayak allegedly helped the businesses of Seashore and Artha Tatwa by building a relationship with top IAS and IPS officers, journalists and politicians of the ruling BJD.
On Sunday, Kumar only said, “I have told the CBI whatever I had to tell them.”
It is learnt that Kumar’s name figured in diaries, envelopes and other documents seized by the CBI from Nayak’s apartment in Bhubaneswar on November 18.
According to the list of seized articles, submitted to the special CBI court and accessed by The Indian Express, a bunch of 12 envelopes contained the names of some officers and advance payments purportedly made to them. Kumar’s name figured in this list. The list also refers to DIG/SBP (Sambalpur, northern range) and SP Dhenkanal, but without giving any name or year.
Later in the evening, Kendrapara SP Satish Gajbhiye was interrogated for about two-and-a-half hours by the CBI. Gajbhiye’s name came up in Nayak’s diary as SP Dhenkanal, it is learnt. Before his transfer to Kendrapara, Gajbhiye was SP in Dhenkanal district. Sources said Nayak allegedly invested in Gajbhiye’s crusher unit.
According to CBI sources, Kumar was interrogated on suspicion of derailing the chit fund probe.
The 1998-batch officer, the first IPS to be questioned in connection with the scam, investigated more than a dozen chit fund companies — including Seashore — in the past two years as the DIG of Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the CID. He took over as north-central range DIG more than a month ago. As head of the EOW, he was leading the chit fund investigation till the CBI took over the probe under orders from the Supreme Court.
Apart from Kumar, the list submitted to the court mentions the name of Anu Garg, the official in the PMO who was earlier secretary in Orissa’s health and family welfare department.
Garg could not be reached for comment despite repeated attempts. Her husband Saurabh Garg, also a 1991-batch IAS officer who is now in the Ministry of Finance, told The Indian Express over phone that his wife is on tour continued…

RBI rules hard on us  but we will comply: UberReserve Bank of India rules hard on us, but we will comply: Uber
Harsimran Julka & Madhav Chanchani, ET Bureau Dec 1, 2014, 04.00AM IST
(Uber says that under its…)
MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: Taxi hailing service Uber sharply criticised Indian rules that require two-step authentication of credit card transactions and sought 45 more days to comply with the central bank's directive on the issue.
On the backfoot after the Reserve Bank of India said customers could not be charged directly on their credit cards, Uber tied up earlier this month with mobile wallet provider Paytm but is complaining that the two-factor authentication is a sub-optimal way of doing business.
"While this requirement is intended to provide more security for consumers, it is an antiquated solution that is cumbersome for consumers and stifling for businesses across India," the company said in a blog post.
"We are going to comply with the norms. While its expensive and hard on us as it hurts the riders and partner drivers, we wanted to do the right thing," said Eric Alexander, head of business at Uber Asia.
Uber, in its blog post, described the requirement of two-factor authentication as "unnecessary and burdensome," but said it had "constructive discussions" with the RBI and is "committed to working with the Indian government to advance regulations that support innovation and job creation."
Uber is upping the ante in India, one of its most important markets, citing the business friendly image of the Narendra Modi government, saying it is eager to "assist in creating Indian government policies that encourage economic growth, spur foreign direct investment and facilitate job creation."
Uber is squaring off against Olacabs, a taxi aggregator founded by IIT-Bombay graduates Bhavish Aggarwal and Ankit Bhati. The Bangalore-based company last month raised $210 million (Rs 1,300 crore) in a round led by Softbank, giving it the financial muscle to establish itself as the market leader in India.
Uber says that under its tieup with Paytm, users can have a mobile wallet in which they can store money to be paid after a ride. The Paytm wallet is linked with debit cards, credit cards and net banking.
Passengers will no longer be able to pay directly using credit cards, a senior executive of the San Franciscobased company said.
Uber, which was valued at $17 billion in its last round of funding earlier this year, is expanding rapidly around the world but also facing opposition from many governments and taxi operators from Bangkok to Berlin where the authorities have declared the service to be illegal.
Just last week, Uber was forced to stop operations in the US state of Nevada and a court in Paris will decide in a few days whether the company is complying with regulations.
In India, too, Uber has run up against radio taxi operators who complained that the app illegally charged customers' credit cards without going through a layer of authentication mandated by the central bank. The Reserve Bank of India agreed with their contention and set November 30 as the deadline for mandatory use of two-step authentication of transactions.
Uber has been giving discounts and even free rides to incentivise users to move to the wallet. Typically these discounts are for new customers, but Uber started free rides for all customers during November 24-30.
At least three Uber drivers ET spoke to said they saw a sharp spike in bookings after the offer. "We used to get about five bookings a day. But with the free ride offer, our bookings daily have shot to about 10-12, with an average daily earning of Rs 3,000 this week," said Vishnu Kumar, a Delhi-based Uber driver.
Paytm also saw wallet downloads increase. "We saw tremendous increase in downloads in over 3 digit percentages. It has also increased our wallet usage as not all rides were under Rs 300," said Amit Lakhotia, vice-president for business at Paytm. The Paytm official declined to disclose the number of downloads.
But even with this spurt, Uber is expected to see a number of customers drop off as it changes the payment system. "If everyone would have converted, this would have been a no-brainer decision. But this has been gut-wrenching because it has significant impact on our user base," said Alexander.

Expansion projects of Mercedes-Benz  Fiat clearedWritten by Nisha Nambiar | Pune |
Posted: December 1, 2014 5:38 am
Clearing proposals submitted by auto giants Fiat and Mercedes-Benz for their expansion projects, the State Environment Assessment Committee has set a condition. They should build toilets in 53 schools and supply clean water to 50 schools without using electricity, as their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).
The State Environment Assessment Committee (SCAC) cleared the proposals after considering their likely impact on environment, along with certain pointers to compensate for the “externality” — the pollution additional production of vehicles would bring in with more vehicles hitting the roads.
The expansion project of Mercedes-Benz India Ltd at MIDC, Chakan, Phase III will roll out 9,000 more vehicles. Fiat India Automobiles expansion project at Ranjangaon will increase production by 10,000 vehicles. Looking at the increase in pollution this could cause, the committee under SEAC incorporated the conditions.
“They are making more vehicles and should carry out corporate social responsibility for pollution caused. The SEAC directed these companies to follow norms. They have to provide toilet facilities and clean drinking water without using electricity,” said an official.
“While Fiat will have to provide toilet facilities for 53 schools in the district, the other auto giant will provide drinking water at about 50 schools,” said environment department officials.
The auto giants had sought clearances for the projects about two months back and they were cleared in the 89th meeting of SEAC recently. In a detailed Environment Impact Assessment report all aspects of air and water pollution, as well as water treatment, paint shops were studied for likely impact on environment. The proposals were cleared after declaring that all aspects were satisfactory.
Fiat is spread on 8.5 lakh square metre area at Ranjangaon, and Benz on 4 lakh square metre at Chakan.
Meanwhile, the Union government on Wednesday agreed to set up an environment regulator vested with powers to appraise industrial projects but with no powers to penalise violators. This follows inter-ministerial and inter-state consultations over the months after an SC order to set up an autonomous body for appraising and penalising offenders.

Gang war: Day after  2 Marne aides heldBy: Express News Service | Pune |
Posted: December 1, 2014 5:35 am
Two persons who are allegedly members of the Gajanan Marne gang, were arrested on Sunday in connection with the murder of Amol Hari Badhe of Hanuman Nagar, known to be an active member of the Nilesh Ghaywal gang.
Two more persons, Santosh Nagu Kamble and Lakhan Lokhande, were also injured in the incident in Navi Peth on Saturday. Kamble has told the Vishrambaug police that Marne himself was present at the time of the attack. Those arrested have been identified as Vishal Shrirang Dimbale alias Gotya (25) and his brother Sagar (24).
The three – Badhe, Kamble and Lokhande – had come to Navi Peth area to attend a funeral at Vaikunth Crematorim. Later, the three were going towards Rajendra Nagar on their bike when they were intercepted by some members of the Gajanan Marne gang. Their four-wheeler knocked the bike down, and the three fell on the ground. The members of the the Marne gang opened fire but the trio got up and tried to flee. Some Marne gang members on motorcycles opened fire at them again.
Badhe was shot in the head while two others escaped the attack with stab injuries. On November 4, Santosh Hiraman Gawade (28), a close aide of Nilesh Ghaywal, was killed in Lavale and Marne was named in the FIR. Other suspects named in the FIR on Saturday’s incident are Balaji Kadam, Rupesh Marne, Vicky Bandal, Sagar Rajput and Vicky Samudre.

HIV-positive: Match-making site ignites wedding hopesBy: Express News Service | Pune |
Posted: December 1, 2014 5:32 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 5:33 am
It was 14 years ago that he tested positive for HIV.  “It was in 2000 that I learnt about it,”says Raj G (name changed). It seems like yesterday, he says. Having put a broken marriage behind his back, a match-making site has ignited interest in him to find an HIV positive life partner.
He is banking on http://www.positivesaathi.com , which has more than 5000 members and has helped over 400 people living with HIV to find soul mates. The portal founders have organised a meet for members registered on their site. On Sunday, ahead of World Aids Day (December 1) the space outside Regional Transport Office was transformed into a dais for patrons who arrived for the meet.
Deputy Regional Transport Officer Anil Valiv who founded the website in October 2006, says that they have come a long way. The portal has gone on to register over five-and-a-half thousand members. “We organised this event to give a platform to members to meet fellow members. If it culminates in a wedding, we help them secure services of NGOs, doctors, lawyers and other facilities,” he says.
Meena Bhat (name changed) in her 20s, says, “I was diagnosed with the condition since birth. I been leading a healthy life since then. It’s not easy to accept at times, but the important part is not to lose hope. Acceptance is not easy in society. A normal life and marriage was a distant reality.”
A doctor and a hypnotist instilled optimism in the visitors.
The websites has had its share of trouble. Anand Shinde, a technician says, “Verifying all registrations was not easy. There were fake profiles, multiple profiles, and profiles of married people. We had to clear the database twice, and send emails to members to re-register. Members often want boys or girls from their own caste. There were cases where marriages have broken because one member was a vegetarian and the other a non-vegetarian. Another barrier is religion.”

Nifty likely to edge higher on strong Q2 GDP datagdp
(Tracking the momentum,…)
NEW DELHI: The 50-share Nifty index is expected to open flat on Monday following muted trend seen in other Asian markets and strong Q2 GDP data. Tracking the momentum, the index is expected to edge higher after muted start to reclaim its crucial psychological level of 8,600.
At 07:30 a.m., Nifty India stock futures in Singapore were trading 0.5 point lower at 8,625 indicating a flat opening on the domestic market.
India's gross domestic product grew better than expected in the July-September quarter but slower than the nine-quarter high recorded in the preceding three-month period.
GDP rose 5.3 per cent in the second quarter of FY15, better than the 5.1 per cent expectation, but below 5.7 per cent recorded in the April-June period, according to data released by the statistics office on Friday
"Against all odds, Q2 GDP figures have shown a surprising jump of 5.3 per cent, beating consensus expectations of 5 per cent. The overall growth of 5.3% benefitted from favorable base in two sectors, viz. Mining and Community, Social & Personal services," says Dr. Soumya Kanti Ghosh, Chief Economic Adviser & GM, Economic Research Department, State Bank of India.
"However, we believe that the Q2 numbers are on the upside and doesn't explain the ground reality," adds Ghosh.
The 50-share Nifty index finally ended the day with a gain of 94 points at 8588. The Sensex was up 255 points at 28693 on Friday.
The momentum is likely to continue trending higher and has an immediate support placed at 8500 and the index would remain firm as long as 8500 is respected, say experts.
"Positional trades may now trail the stop loss of long positions to 8420 as it has now emerged as a key support for the index," GEPL Capital said in a report.
"If Nifty manages to sustain above 8500 then the recent gains may extend higher and Nifty may test 8710 in coming few sessions. Only a breach of 8420 would be the indication of weakness," added the report.
Overnight, US stocks ended mostly flat in a holiday-shortened session on Friday, but major indexes rose for a sixth straight week.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.49 points to 17,828.24, the S&P 500 lost 5.27 points, or 0.25 per cent, to 2,067.56 and the Nasdaq Composite added 4.31 points, or 0.09 per cent, to 4,791.63.
Asian shares were trading flat. Japan's Nikkei 225 index which was trading 0.97 per cent higher at 17,630 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was trading 1.2 per cent lower at 23,679. China's Shanghai index was trading 0.30 per cent higher at 2,705.

Will swap land with Dhaka  end illegal influx: Narendra ModiPrime Minister Narendra Modi said that his government would go ahead with a land transfer deal with Bangladesh keeping illegal influx and Assam’s long-term security interests in mind.
 
Bangladesh stands to gain some 10,000 acres of land through this deal the UPA government had initiated in 2011 and placed as a bill for ratification in Rajya Sabha in December last year. The BJP in Assam had opposed this deal, as did the Trinamool Congress in West Bengal.
Addressing party workers in Guwahati on Sunday, Modi said, “The land swap deal will be beneficial. It might seem to be an immediate loss for Assam, but it will serve security interests in the long term and help solve the problem of Bangladeshi migrants.”
Infiltration from Bangladesh is a major issue in the Northeast. It is viewed as a demographic invasion designed to out-populate scores of indigenous communities in the region.
 
The Prime Minister said there would be no compromise with the security of the strategic Northeast. “The forces trying to destabilise Assam and the Northeast should know that Delhi has a new government and the law will not spare them now,” he said.
Insisting that the BJP brand of politics was not based on casteism, communalism or regionalism, Modi said his party believes in nationalism. “Our mantra of inclusive development has compelled all political parties to rework their agendas,” he said, adding that his government has special plans for the Northeast.

Bigg Boss winner Gauahar Khan  slapped  for wearing short skirt on reality showActor Gauahar Khan slapped for wearing short skirt on reality show

Actor and model Gauahar Khan was allegedly slapped by a 24-year-old youth who was in the audience of a singing show hosted by her at Film City, Goregaon (East), on Sunday. The Aarey Sub police have detained the suspect, Akil Malik. Police sources said the accused told them he disapproved of the actor wearing a short skirt.

According to the police, the incident took place during the final episode of India's Raw Star at studio number 9. “A preliminary probe has revealed that someone from the audience started teasing Khan to which she protested. An argument ensued between Gauahar and the man who was teasing her. Things turned ugly when the man suddenly slapped the actor,” an Aarey police officer said requesting anonymity.
India's Raw Star is an Indian singing competition series hosted by Khan and mentored by singer-rapper Yo Yo Honey Singh.
The brawl did not end there with one of the show’s finalists and one of the production men beating up the accused. Guards deployed at the venue intervened and caught the accused and handed him over to the police who later sent him for a medical examination.
A source from the show reveals, “There were over 2,500 people present at the venue with 250 bouncers. Yet a 24-year-old guy in the crowd teased Khan and got into an argument with her. While he was being escorted out of the place, he managed to go up on stage and slapped her.”
The source adds, “It was chaos after the security pulled the man away. Gauahar was shocked and was crying a lot. A stunned Gauahar didn’t understand what happened. Though the shooting was stopped, Gauahar took a break of an hour to gather her bearings and then reported back on stage to finish the leftover one hour shoot.”
“We will record Khan’s statement in detail and will register a case under section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 354 (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) of Indian Penal Code and will arrest the accused youth,” said Vilas Chavan, senior inspector of the Aarey Sub police station.

The brave college-going sisters, who fought back eve-teasers in a Haryana Roadways bus, will be honoured by Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Republic day.
In a rare show of courage, the two sisters thrashed three molestors inside a bus in Haryana's Rohtak town, even as passengers chose to look the other way.
Both sisters confronted the accused and mustered enough courage to thrash them, with one of the girls even hitting the youths with her belt, for allegedly outraging their modesty.
The entire incident, recorded by a passenger on mobile phone, went viral both on television and social media. It showed the two girls using their hands and a belt to thrash the molestors, who appeared to be taken by surprise.
A case has been registered against three youths in this connection, police said on Sunday. No arrest has, however, been made so far.
The accused have been identified as Kuldeep, Mohit and Deepak, police said, adding that a case under section 354 (assault or criminal force with intent to outrage woman's modesty) and section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of IPC have been registered against them.
The victims in their complaint alleged that they were harassed by some youths in a Haryana Roadways bus when they were going to their college on Friday.
When the victims objected, one of the accused started beating them up.
Not to give up easily, the girls fought with the accused as fellow passengers remained mute spectators. One of the victims even hit the accused with a belt, police said.
One of the girls said, "They threatened us and abused us. One of them touched my sister inappropriately. They started making obscene gestures... After heated exchanges, one of the boys called his friends asking him to beat us up. One of them beat my sister while two others caught hold of me.
"Then, I whipped out my belt and thrashed them. They pushed us out of the bus when it slowed down," she narrated.
Meanwhile, the father of the two sisters alleged that there was pressure from the panchayat that the girls should withdraw the complaint.
SP Rohtak Shanshank Anand told PTI over phone, "We have identified the accused and soon they will be arrested. These are brave girls and we fully support them."

SI Reporter | Mumbai Dec 01, 2014 08:29 AM IST
Markets are likely to open on a flat note tracking the mixed trends in their Asian peers. Some volatility is expected later in the session as the stocks which have logged new highs in the past few sessions will react sharply to GDP data that was released after markets closed on Friday. 
 
At 5.3% GDP growth for the July-September quarter is better than street expectations but lower than the 5.7% growth of the last quarter which has increased the clamour for a rate cut from RBI though the central bank may defer any such measure to the next policy review meeting. 
 
The release of HSBC manufacturing PMI data for November on Monday and HSBC India services PMI on Wednesday would also help shape directions.
 
At 8:30AM, the early indicator SGX Nifty was flat at 8,617.
Meanwhile, foreign institutional investors were net buyers in Indian equities worth Rs 935.86  crore on Friday, as per provisional stock exchange data.
Asian markets are largely trading weak with the notable exception of Nikkei index which has gained around 0.8%. According to HSBC manufacturing PMI data for the month of November, there is a modest recovery in the Japanese economy. The final Markit/JMMA Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) was 52.0 in November.
 
Chinese shares are trading mixed with Hang Seng losing close to 2% and Shanghai Composite index gaining 0.6%.
 
Overnight, US stocks ended mostly flat in a holiday-shortened session on Friday, but major indexes rose for a sixth straight week.
 
The Dow Jones industrial average ended flat at 17,828, the S&P 500 lost  0.2% to 2,067.56 and the Nasdaq Composite closed flat at 4,791.63.
 
Stocks in focus
 
Auto shares will be in focus as these companies would be unveiling their monthly sales figures. Hero MotoCorp  will be in focus on its plans to expand in Southern America. The company is planning to set up manufacturing units in Brazil and Argentina and a plant is coming up in Colombia.
 
OMCs like HPCL,BPCL and IOC  will be in focus as petrol price was cut by 91 paise a litre on Sunday, the seventh reduction since August, and diesel by 84 paise per litre, the third straight cut, as international oil rates continued to slump.
 
JSW Steel is in focus on the reports that is  is working towards a de-risking strategy for iron ore that will fuel its ambition to turn its Bellary plant into the world’s largest single-site steel plant by 2022.
 
Engineering and construction major Punj Lloyd will be in focus as it  will finalise its stake sale in Gurgaon-based hospital Medanta Medicity by December-end, a move aimed at reducing the company's Rs 6,000 crore debt.
 

Ebola-cured travellers must undergo body fluid testsWritten by Utkarsh Anand | New Delhi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 2:19 am
The Union Health Ministry has asked Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) to issue advisory to all Indian missions abroad to ensure that a person cured of Ebola is allowed to travel to India only after all his body fluids have tested negative for the virus and after a period of 90 days have elapsed from the date that he or she has been considered cured of the deadly disease.
The latest screening measures have been proposed after traces of the virus were found in the semen of a 26-year-old man, who was said to have recovered from Ebola in Liberia and given a certificate of medical clearance from Liberian health authorities. The man is currently kept under isolation in the special health facility of Delhi airport.
After the incident, the Health Ministry held a review meeting with state health secretaries on November 21 where it was decided to revise the advisory.
Taking cue from the US government, the Health Ministry has also written to the Civil Aviation Secretary for “re-routing” passengers from West African countries, affected by Ebola, to some select airports in the country where intensive screening mechanism has been put in place. Seven airports across the country have been earmarked for such screening.
Meanwhile, the Home Secretary has been asked by the Health Ministry to make all travellers from the affected countries go through the mandatory health check before they are cleared through immigration.
As on November 13, a total of 691 passengers were under government’s surveillance programme. Of them 70 are belonged to high-risk cases, according to the ministry’s affidavit in the Supreme Court regarding government’s preparedness against Ebola. The SC, while admitting a PIL on the issue by Vineet Dhanda, had earlier issued notices to the Centre and states.

Arvind Kejriwal promises VAT rationalisationAfter Christmas in school holiday row, Narendra Modi govt backtracks
Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal promised to rationalise the Value Added Tax (VAT) in Delhi, if his party came to power.  At a fundraising lunch organised the party’s traders wing at the national capital here, AAP collected Rs 50 lakh.
Addressing traders, Kejriwal promised to rationalise VAT on products, which were higher in states, especially neighbouring ones, saying this will help consumers and traders, both of whom were unhappy with the arbitrary manner it was currently calculated without a proper rationale and proposed to initiate online payment of taxes.
The party collected Rs 50 lakh from the event, while a similar event held in Mumbai last Thursday fetched Rs 91 lakh, taking the total to Rs 1.41 crore in just two such events.
Entry fee for the event was Rs 20,000.
AAP plans to hold similar high-cost meals in the national capital and Bangalore, and attempts are being made to hold one in Kolkata.
The party has set a target of Rs 30 crore for the Assembly elections.
Outlining the party’s vision for traders of Delhi, Kejriwal said his party wanted to make the national capital a trading powerhouse by creating a traders friendly environment.
“AAP will abolish raids by VAT department inspectors which are carried in the name of sudden visits. Tax collection from traders cannot be coercive, since it is counter-productive and leads to more tax evasion. Traders have to be encouraged to pay taxes on time by providing incentives and the AAP government will abolish all coercive measures currently used against traders,” he said.
Kejriwal added that his party will give priority to revive the wholesale business in Delhi and will make all possible efforts to turn the national capital into a retail hub.
The party will soon unveil its plan to encourage the wholesale distributive character of the national capital.

Will RBI Governor Raghuaram Rajan succumb to rate cut pressureWill RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan succumb to pressure to cut rates?
Manojit Saha | Mumbai Dec 01, 2014 09:28 AM IST
Tuesday    will be a litmus test for an economist with unquestionable credentials. Come December 2,  Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan’s resolve to fight inflation will be tested against the backdrop of finance ministry’s constant soundbytes to do otherwise.
 
Pressure from the mandarins at North Block – where the Finance Ministry is housed – is not new for a central bank governor. Both Rajan’s and current finance minister Arun Jaitley’s predecessors were often at loggerheads openly, sometimes through TV appearances or the written word.
 
Jaitley’s predecessor Pallaniappan Chidambaram once famously said when Duvvuri Subbarao declined to cut rates that the government would walk alone to revive growth. To which Subbarao’s parting shot was ‘Let Chidambaram take a walk but he will thank that the RBI exists.’
 
While Chidambaram - a lawyer by profession  - was keen to portray himself no less than a super regulator, his predecessor was less ‘hands on’. Pranab Mukherjee, the then finance minister and now President of the country, left the job of managing government banks to the bureaucrats, particularly to one DK Mittal who was the then financial services secretary. He shot to fame by sending instructions to public sector bank chairmen almost every day, thereby encroaching on the ‘turf’ of RBI which is the constitutional body to regulate banks in India. Later, a committee appointed by Rajan and headed by former Axis Bank chairman P J Nayak, and a former bureaucrat in the finance ministry, pointed out the need to end dual regulation because it crippled the functioning of PSBs.
 
Then, too, the finance ministry never quite liked the idea of the RBI governor crossing the street, quite literally, to visit South Block – where the prime minister’s office is located – after the customary pre-policy meeting with the finance minister.
 
So why should we expect Jaitley to be different? There is absolutely no reason, even if Jaitley is not seen as ‘hands on’ or known for ‘handpicking’ secretaries, (which is now done by the prime minister himself).
 
However, in the the last one month of his five-month tenure, Jaitley increasing looks like his ‘super regulator’ predecessors. He has made it a habit of giving the same soundbytes to the media like his predecessors on why RBI should cut interest rates.
 
That is why this is the first time that Rajan, the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is facing perhaps the toughest test in his one and a quarter year tenure at Mint Road. This will likely be a tougher battle than the currency crisis that India won hands down or the inflation battle which Rajan is on the verge of winning – retail inflation has fallen from double digits to below 6% in 13 months. 
 
It has been proved beyond any iota of doubt that previous finance ministers miscalculated the ferocity of inflation which impoverished the marginal sections of society for about three years now. 
 
It is best left to the governor of central bank who is better equipped to tackle it. To quote Rajan himself: “Let’s fight the battle against inflation once and win.”

Long Nifty today; like Ashok Leyland  PNB  Axis Bk: SukhaniSudarshan Sukhani of s2analystics.com says the mood in the market is positive and traders should long the market. On specific stocks, Sukhani is bullish on  Ashok Leyland and  Punjab National Bank and Axis Bank .
Below is the transcript of Sudarshan Sukhani\\'s interview with Latha Venkatesh and Sonia Shenoy on CNBC-TV18.
Sonia: It looks like a good start to trade after the smooth run that we had on Friday and today’s expectations how would you trade the Nifty?
A: We would trade the Nifty by being on the long side. I don’t think there is any confusion on that. For many months and at least for the last few weeks, the critical question is if you do not have a position in the Nifty or the Bank Nifty, do you want to buy now and the answer is yes, we are never targeting prices, we do not say this is where the price could go because we know that these are all time highs and a sustained uptrend. What we are always saying is keep a stop - if it doesn’t work out, you get stopped out otherwise you must be in this market.
So for a market that is likely to open up, if you have a position in the Nifty, follow the stops that I am suggesting, if you don’t have one then take a position and then follow the same stops. For the Nifty assuming a gap up which seems likely, your stop should be somewhere around 8,470 and for the Bank Nifty at 18,000. So these are the two levels, within this be on the long side.
Latha: What is the individual stock calls? Within the Nifty itself, your bets are on  ITC and TCS .
A: Yes, there is some amount of sector rotation that is possible. We have seen a sharp run up in banks and some of the banks sort of take a back seat and as we have already seen, IT is a buy on dips opportunity, ITC is on the verge of lifetime breakouts, both are heavyweights on the Nifty and if the Nifty goes up, it picks up some segments then pushes the participants and in that sense, this one should also go up, ITC as well as TCS.
Sonia: You have a buy on Ashok Leyland today, you think that will resume its uptrend now?
A: It does seem so. Ashok Leyland had a very minor correction, that correction seems to have come to an end and good stocks, outperforming stocks continue to do that.
I will just share my weekend experience with you. I went to Thiruvananthapuram to attend the Silver Jubilee function of a brokerage firm there. So the two takeaways were I had the pleasure of meeting Chitra Ramakrishna, MD of NSE. The NSE is the backbone of the Indian financial system and meeting here reassured that it is in very safe hands. There were more than 1,500 people attending that function. That tells me that the equity culture is growing now slowly people are coming in the markets.
Latha: Besides Ashok Leyland, you like LIC Housing . It has been a long-time favourite, isn’t it?
A: It is a long time favourite, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) will do wonders. We are just starting that process. There was a small correction, that correction is over, buy LIC Housing -- you cannot go wrong buying banks and NBFCs. Even if you buy at a high price, stay, the next rally will take you up.
Sonia: Two banks that you have today, Punjab National Bank (PNB) and Axis Bank, one private and one public. You expect both these pockets to move with equal vigour?
A: I think they should. ICICI Bank has done its bit. Axis is on the verge of a breakout and PNB is a very interesting story. It has done nothing, it has been in a trading range for four months on the back of some fundamentals or whatever, it cannot stay there. It is on the verge of a significant breakout. So if you want a position trade, PNB is ideally poised for that.
Latha: I would have normally started with the Nifty and celebrated the fact that it has touched 8,500 but I want to ask you about the metal stocks.  Hindalco up 3 percent,  JSPL up 3 percent,  Sesa up 2.7 percent,  Tata Steel 2.3 percent, anything that is giving you more of a trading bounce from hereon?
A: Only Hindalco and that also to a limited extent. I think this is only just a knee-jerk reaction to the Chinese rate cut and the charts haven’t changed, the charts are still slightly downbeat for metal stocks. So I would not advise traders to rush into them. Hindalco independently had a chart that suggested some upside but that is about it.
Sonia: The stock of last week was clearly  State Bank of India (SBI), it was up 10 percent and this morning as well, SBI is moving with some strength, from the banking pack, would you still stick with some of these largercap PSU banks or now would you look outside the index?
A: I would be willing to buy anything. SBI was always a favourite. It still is. It has not finished its upmove. In a short-term horizon, today, tomorrow, day after, there could be some pullbacks, I don’t know about that but if you want to make an investing idea, want to have a position trade then at current levels, SBI is number one in the bank list and then there are PSU banks, we talked about Punjab National Bank (PNB) and  Canara Bank also comes in that,  Corporation Bank which is not in the F&O is also very appropriate idea for position trade or an investing theme.
Latha: Anything at all in the midcap banking space that catches your eye, public or private?
A: Yes,  Vijaya Bank and  Dena Bank both public sector banks are building bases and willing to go higher, so both are ideas. I don’t think they are short-term trades but have a view till the end of December at current prices, they are worth buying into.
Latha:  NMDC among the metal space is of any interest to you?
A: NMDC has a different story. It is almost at its lows. So just the very fact that it has its lows and a bounce could come, it is worth buying. A risk here on the downside is very limited but I don’t see this as a short-term one-two days trade but then it shouldn’t be -- this market rewards traders who are holding on for a few weeks rather than just one day.
Sonia: Give us a chart check on Crompton Greaves .
A: Crompton Greaves is building a base and willing to go higher. I don’t know how the market is going to react to the news and I don’t understand it but I would be a buyer in Crompton Greaves, keep a stop somewhere around Rs 180-181, it is a position trade but worth taking.

Gross NPAs of PSU banks rise to 5.33% in SeptemberGross NPAs of PSU banks rise to 5.33% in September
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 28, 2014  | 17:08 IST
Non-performing assets (NPA) of public sector banks rose sharply to 5.33 per cent of total advances in September 2014 mainly due to sluggishness in the economy and other factors, including delay in environmental clearances.
The gross NPAs of state-run lenders stood at 4.72 per cent of total advances at the end of March 2014. The main reasons for increase in NPAs of banks are sluggishness in the domestic growth during the recent past, slowdown in recovery in the global economy, uncertainty in the global markets, delay in environmental permits..., Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha said in a written reply to the Lok Sabha.
Besides, external factors like ban in mining projects, and aggressive lending by banks in the past, especially during goods times, were among the reasons for rise in stressed assets, he added. He further said that the cancellation of coal blocks in September 2014 and its impact on the asset quality of banks depends on the time of resolution of this issue.
The government has ascertained that the impact of cancellation coal block allotment on PSBs due to likely stoppage of production of power plants is estimated at Rs 96,484 crore. The net NPAs of PSBs at the end of September rose to 3.14 per cent, from 2.74 per cent in March 2014.

National gene bank discovery to help develop wheatvarietiesGold futures fall 1.13% on weak global cues
The National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR), commonly known as the national gene bank, has identified around 45 accessions (a unique identifier given to a protein sequence) out of its collection of 20,000 accessions which have been found to be resilient to heat during grain formation period.
This identification of traits of genes would help agricultural scientists developing new wheat varieties which can deal with fluctuations in temperature commonly witnessed in the north of India since the last few years.
Agricultural scientists associated with the characterisation drive say that the purpose is to help provide large genetic variability which helps in quality seed development.
These wheat accessions or germplasms, identified in the last three years, will soon be put into the national varietal development programme for creating new varieties of seeds for farmers. It takes about 5 -10 years after the identification of genes to develop a new variety.
“Identified genes will play a crucial role in development of next generation wheat seed varieties which would withstand adverse impact of higher temperature being witnessed in the last few years in key growing areas,” KC Bansal, director, NBPGR, told FE.
According to him, the national gene bank, located in the heart of the Capital, has also identified around 50 wheat accessions which have the capacity to deal with various rust attacks commonly seen in the crop in northern India.
“We have been dealing with the issue of yellow and steam rust in wheat crop for the last few years and the new varietal development programme would get support from genes resources identified by the national gene bank,” said a senior scientist with the Directorate of Wheat Research (DWR), a premier research institute based in Karnal, Haryana.
The gene bank had launched the research programme on ‘acquisition, evaluation and identification of climate resilient wheat and rice genetic resources for tolerance to heat, drought, and salt stresses’ under the agriculture ministry’s ‘National Initiative on Climate Resilient Agriculture’ started three years ago.
The gene bank has prioritised 15 categories, including rice, wheat, maize, pearl millet, finger millet, chickpea, mustard, okra, brinjal and mango, for gene preservation initiatives.
At present, according to regulations, the germplasm held with the gene bank is only shared with state-owned research institutes.
Out of the total collection of germplasm at NBPGR, about 90,000 will be rice varieties. Others include wheat (20,000), vegetables (24,000), total oilseeds (55,000) and pulses (50,000). Threats to these crops are kept in a genebank in the form of seeds.
The NBPGR has collected genes of around 1,500 crop species, including ornamental, oilseeds and medicinal. But the majority of them, which are critical to food and nutritional security, will be around 15-20.
According to the agriculture ministry’s data, the country’s wheat production has increased from 72.7 million tonne in 2001-2 to 95.9 million tonne in 2013-14.
However, in the last few years, because of wide fluctuation in temperature and appearance of yellow rust in northern India, agricultural scientists have expressed concern about sustaining wheat production in the long run.
Eeureka!

03:30pm Market Closing
The market ended at new record closing high on Friday following further fall in crude oil prices after the OPEC decided not to cut output. Hopes of rate cut or indication of rate cut in monetary policy on December 2 also pushed market higher.
The Sensex rose 255.08 points or 0.90 percent to close at 28693.99 and the Nifty climbed 94.05 points or 1.11 percent to 8588.25.
About 1499 shares have advanced, 1521 shares declined, and 99 shares are unchanged on the Bombay Stock Exchange.
Punjab National Bank, Bank of Baroda, Asian Paints, State Bank of India, IndusInd Bank, Axis Bank, Tata Motors, Tata Steel and M&M were top gainers, up 2.5-7.4 percent.
However, Cairn India fell 4.44 percent followed by Sesa Sterlite with 3 percent loss. Jindal Steel, Bharti Airtel, ONGC, GAIL and Dr Reddy's Labs declined 0.4-0.9 percent.
03:15pm DLF in News
In a temporary relief for realty major DLF, the Supreme Court (SC) today has granted status quo to the Punjab and Haryana High court order directing re-auction of 350 acre land parcel, which was alloted to the company in the year 2009.
The Punjab and Haryana High court had ordered the Haryana Government to scrap this land deal after concerns were raised by the farmers. Also, it had directed re-auction of this land.
The apex court has also issued notice to the Haryana government with respect to the DLF appeal.
DLF was allotted this land at Wazirabad in Gurgaon for Rs 1750 crore. The company emerged as sole bidder in competitive bids after Unitech, Malaysian Consortium dropped out of it on technical grounds. The real estate player had submitted bids for 12,000 per sq mt as against a reserve price for 11,978 per sq mt.
03:00pm NBFCs in Focus
Shares in non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) gained ground today after the Raghuram Rajan-led Reserve Bank of India (RBI) last evening issued final guidelines for allowing the set up of “payment banks” and “small finance banks” in the country.
Shares of Shriram Transport Finance, Sundaram Finance, SREI Infra Finance, Manappuram Finance and Muthoot Finance surged 3.9 percent to 4.3 percent amid hopes the companies would have a shot at turning themselves into small banks.
The central bank defines a payment bank as one that will be allowed to take deposits and offer remittances up to a small limit (Rs 1 lakh currently) to its customers but cannot lend money. A small finance bank will operate in a similar fashion to a normal bank (by taking deposits, offering withdrawals as well as offering loans) but with a focus on small, underserved areas of the country.
A typical candidate for a payments bank is a telecom company or a retail chain that can tap into its existing captive customers and provide them technology-based financial services such as payments and withdrawals.
While the issue of guidelines pertaining to small banks is expected to pave the way for several non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) to convert into one, a move that would also bring them closer to becoming a universal bank in future.
02:45pm Interview
Shobhit Uppal, Deputy Managing Director, Ahluwalia Contracts is confident of the company meeting its topline target of Rs 1100 crore for FY15 and growing at 20-25 percent for FY16-FY17 backed by new orders from the public sector covered with escalation clause. The company has already completed 90 percent of the old low margins orders, said Uppal.
The net order book for the company stands at Rs 3500 crore dividedly equally between public and private. And orders from the private sector are likely to pick up over the next 6-12 months, he added.
On the execution front, he said the pace of execution on the public side has picked up but is still slow on the private sector side because of liquidity issues.  
The company sees re-development and smart cities as future growth drivers.
02:30pm Fiscal Deficit
India's fiscal deficit was Rs 4.76 trillion (USD 76.77 billion) during April-October, or 89.6 percent of the full-year target, government data showed on Friday.
The deficit was 84.4 percent during the comparable period in the previous fiscal year.
Net tax receipts were at Rs 3.69 trillion (USD 59.52 billion) in the first seven months of the current fiscal year that ends in March 2015, reports Reuters.
02:15pm Gold Update
Gold extended losses into a third session today, dropping to a one-week low, on expectations that plunging oil prices could sap inflationary pressure, curbing the metal's appeal as a hedge.
Oil hit four-year lows around USD 70 a barrel, as OPEC resisted the temptation to cut back production following a more than 30 percent plunge in prices since June.
The drop in oil prices, along with the resulting strength in the dollar, hurt gold which is often seen as a hedge.
Spot gold had fallen 0.3 percent to USD 1,187.40 an ounce by 0741 GMT. It hit USD 1,181.30 earlier in the session - its lowest since November 20.
The metal has lost over 1 percent for the week, snapping a three-week rally.
US gold futures slid 1 percent to a session low of USD 1,180.60, reports Reuters.
02:00pm Market Check
The market remained in strong uptrend with the Sensex rising 338.92 points or 1.19 percent to 28777.83 and the Nifty climbing 118.10 points or 1.39 percent to 8612.30.
About 1600 shares have advanced, 1303 shares declined, and 105 shares are unchanged on the Bombay Stock Exchange.
The Indian equity market is in a strong bull phase and is looking good at the current levels, Nirmal Jain, chairman, IIFL said in an interview to CNBC-TV18. The valuation of Indian market is fair at the current levels, he said. However, he foresees one bout of correction before Budget.
Meanwhile, the decline in global crude price is likely to benefit paint and tyre companies, he said. On the macro front, it will have a broader positive impact on the India economy and will help soften inflation levels, he added.
Sharing his expectations from December 2 monetary policy, Jain said that the RBI will take into account recent dynamic global developments. He sees 50-60 percent chance of rate cut on Tuesday.
Punjab National Bank, Bank of Baroda, Asian Paints, IndusInd Bank, State Bank of India, Axis Bank, Tata Motors, Tata Steel and ICICI Bank topped the buying list, up 2.5-8 percent. However, Cairn India fell 3.74 percent impacted by fall in crude oil prices. Sesa Sterlite and Bharti Airtel declined 1.5 percent each.
Among midcaps, Jet Airways shot up 20 percent followed by Syndicate Bank, J&K Bank, Sobha Developers and UCO Bank with 6-7 percent gain while Max India, Aban Offshore, Raymond, Sulabh Engineer and AstraZeneca Pharma slipped 3-4 percent.
In macro data to watch out today, second quarter GDP may point to a slowdown in growth rate. CNBC-TV18 poll shows Q2 GDP coming in at 5.2 percent led by slower manufacturing.

The central bank defines a payment bank as one that will be allowed to take deposits, issue debit cards, offer remittances up to a small limit (Rs 1 lakh currently) and distribute financial products such as insurance and mutual funds to its customers but cannot lend money. Most deposits will have to kept in government securities.
A small finance bank will operate in a similar fashion to a normal bank (by taking deposits, offering withdrawals as well as offering loans) but with a focus on small, underserved areas of the country.

In trade today, shares in Shriram Transport Finance , Sundaram Finance , SREI Infra Finance , Manappuram Finance  and Muthoot Finance  surged 3.9 percent to 4.3 percent amid hopes the companies would have a shot at turning themselves into small banks.
“The obvious beneficiaries of this regulation will be Shriram Group (Shriram Transport and Shriram City Union Finance), Sundaram Finance, micro finance institutions and possibly other small NBFCs such as Manappuram, Muthoot or SREI should they choose to convert and RBI under its “fit and proper” guideline decides to give them a license,” a note by brokerage firm JPMorgan said.
“ Mahindra Finance , L&T Finance Holdings , LIC Housing Finance , Indiabulls Housing Finance  and Dewan Housing Finance  are likely ruled out given their promoters run industrial houses or are state-owned entities both of which are not eligible,” it added.
Payment and small finance banks are important initiatives to bring under-banked people into the organised financial system by increasing the convenience of bank accounts, a note by CLSA said.
“Both these formats are expected to intensely leverage on digital platforms to offer low-cost and convenient services. We believe this will also drive digitisation of India’s banking sector,” it added.

Healthy gut microbiota can prevent metabolic syndromeSkipping meals makes kids obese: Study
Promoting healthy gut microbiota, the bacteria that live in the intestine, can help treat or prevent metabolic syndrome, scientists have found.
A person with metabolic syndrome is twice as likely to develop heart disease and five times as likely to develop diabetes.
Researchers at Georgia State University and Cornell University did a follow-up on their previous research published in journal Science, using an improved technical approach to make the results more significant.
In the previous study, researchers showed altered gut microbiota plays a role in promoting metabolic syndrome.
Gut microbiota performs key functions in health and when it becomes dysregulated it can promote chronic inflammatory diseases such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.
In addition, altered gut microbiota promotes inflammation that leads to metabolic syndrome.
“We’ve filled in a lot of the details about how it works,” said Dr Andrew Gewirtz, a professor in the Institute for Biomedical Sciences at Georgia State.
“It’s the loss of TLR5 on the epithelium, the cells that line the surface of the intestine and their ability to quickly respond to bacteria.
“That ability goes away and results in a more aggressive bacterial population that gets closer in and produces substances that drive inflammation,” Gewirtz said.
Normally, the bacteria are in the mucous layer at a certain distance away from epithelial cells. The researchers showed altered gut microbiota is more aggressive in infiltrating the host and gets very close to the epithelium.
This altered population produces flagellin and lipopolysaccharide, which further promote inflammation.
The research team improved the study by comparing mice that were siblings and littermates, making all conditions in the study the same. The mice only differed by whether they were missing a specific gene, TLR5.
Previously, the researchers studied mice that were from two different strains and lived in separate environments.
In the new study, they found the absence of TLR5 on the intestinal surface leads to alterations in bacteria that drive inflammation, leading to metabolic syndrome.
“These results suggest that developing a means to promote a more healthy microbiota can treat or prevent metabolic disease,” Gewirtz said.
“They confirm the concept that altered microbiota can promote low-grade inflammation and metabolic syndrome and advance the underlying mechanism.
“We showed that the altered bacterial population is more aggressive in infiltrating the host and producing substances, namely flagellin and lipopolysaccharide, that further promote inflammation,” Gewirtz said.
The findings are published in the journal Gastroenterology.

Rampal promised followers a place in heaven
Rampal's trusted followers worked like agents and spread out far and wide to find and fleece people by peddling miracles, cures and spiritual powers.
Mail Today –  Fri 28 Nov, 2014

NEW DELHI: Claiming to sell salvation to unsuspecting followers, controversial godman Rampal took a cue from ponzi operators to expand his evil empire.
His trusted followers worked like agents and spread out far and wide to find and fleece people by peddling miracles, cures and spiritual powers.
Unlike a ponzi operation, however, Rampal did not pay any commission to his “agents”.
“Every follower was required to bring in at least three members or a family. The followers preyed on the poor and the illiterate and sold them the idea that baba possessed miraculous healing powers and could rid them of any ailment or problem," a follower told Mail Today.
Police sources said while every newcomer was free to attend a single spiritual discourse or satsang, he had to pay Rs 1,000 for the initiation process, called Naamdaan. This was done publicly, and the follower was given a Guru Mantra which was in fact the Gayatri Mantra.
Rampal would ask new followers to chant the mantra for three months. That was how a primary membership of Satlok Ashram could be obtained.
For the secondary membership, Rampal would ask his followers to get Satnaam, for which he charged Rs 9,000. Members buying Satnaam were given a better deal by Rampal and were involved in the Ashram’s activities.
Saarnaam was the third type of membership, given after a follower had spent 10 years with Rampal. He would be charged Rs 10,000 for this and would be included in the executive committee of the Satlok Ashram.
The Satlok ticket was the highest degree that a follower could aspire for and which was awarded after 15 years for one lakh rupees. Rampal and his henchmen claimed that by getting a Satlok ticket, a follower would directly land in heaven.
"Yes, it is true he used to charge Rs 1,000 initially and then Rs 9,000. But I have no knowledge about the Satlok Ticket. But he fooled people by telling them that he would send them to heaven," Superintendent of Police, Hisar, Satender Kumar Gupta told Mail Today.
FREE ELEVATION
Police investigation revealed Rampal had promised “free elevation” to higher grades during the police raid if his followers guarded his Satlok Ashram.
When the police cordoned off his Ashram he allegedly promised free 'Saarnaam' worth Rs 10000 to every follower. The poor, who were unable to buy this 'honour', took up this offer and guarded his fortress. Rampal has admitted during questioning that he lured followers with Saarnaam.
WHERE'S HIS MONEY?
A big mystery now is Rampal’s missing money. According to Hisar SP Satender Kumar Gupta, police has recovered Rs 3.5 lakh from Satlok Ashram besides coins weighing 90 kgs and valued at around Rs 2 lakh. Rampal's seized bank accounts contain only Rs 24 lakh.
Unconfirmed sources said that Rampal was planning to buy land close to his ashram and had paid an advance of Rs 50 lakh to the owner. He was yet to clear ration and other bills worth several crores of rupees.
"A probe is on and we are trying to figure out the net worth of Rampal's ashram, besides tracing his cash reserves," Satender Kumar Gupta said.
MORE GRILLING
The Haryana Police, meanwhile, are planning to bring Rampal to Betul in Madhya Pradesh to interrogate him about his ambitious plans to construct an ashram in Urdan village of the district.
According to highly-placed sources, Rampal knew the detailed plan of his under-construction ashram, which could have easily accommodated over 50,000 people at one time and had two lakes, a water filter plant, swimming pool and separate accommodation for males and females among his 10,000 sewadars.
However with his arrest, the under-construction work in his sprawling ashram has come to a grinding halt. It is spread over an area of 70 acres in Urdan village situated along the National Highway 69.
On Wednesday, some of his sewadars approached the district electricity board office and requested that power supply to his under-construction ashram should be discontinued.

You’ve filed for divorce, so why aren’t you free?
Yo-yoing between court dates. Losing money. Losing your mind. Praying at makeshift court shrines for the litigation to end. Playing cat and mouse with your ex. Befriending fellow aspiring divorcees. Here’s what a divorce case in a Mumbai court really looks like.

Tick, tick, tick…this was the monotony of court dates. It was like eating dal and rice everyday without respite, with never a vada pav in sight and no point in dreaming of pizza. What was going on? Did our legal system suck so much? Did we all have so much free time that we could spend whole days in court only to come back with the princely prize of…NOTHING? You’d maybe get a new court date after four months and then needed to fervently pray that the judge would not be on leave.
What you see in the movies or on television where there is immediate resolution of a crime with punishment swiftly following after is just a fantasy world. However, the horror stories you hear about two generations fighting in court are true. I shuddered to think of my fate. I yo-yoed from one court date to another and the court date became the walls separating each compartment of my life. Then I saw that each court date was the defining point of my life and everything else was in-between. Even then it seemed like a sad waste of a talented young woman.
Nothing ever changed. The courts were never painted, the clerks were transferred after two or three years, the judges also got transferred to other cities, and the lawyers were still demanding money and lording over the clients unless you were someone really important.
I always went to the little makeshift temple. It was just a foot-high deity lodged in a niche created on a tiled platform below a shady banyan tree just outside the court. There would be people behind me queuing up to say their prayers too, and sometimes I would meet the same litigants on my floor in the court or who I had seen from time to time coming again and again to court. I would rush and finish in one minute, take my prasad and hope my prayers would yield benefits (it’s ironic that we pray to God for a minute in this rushed buzz of the day, and that too for a case that goes on forever). I would then get off on the right floor and reserve a seat outside my courtroom, where my case was going on, by keeping my bag there. The courtroom also evoked a sense of ownership because, after all, I had been coming here for almost eight years now. I would then have my name checked on the roster and would sit staring into space, trying to avoid my fellow inmates because the family court was a mental and emotional jail.
Vandana ShahI’d look at the news, read the gossip, listen to my iPod, eat a little and wait. It’s the waiting that kills you, and there is so much of it you do. Each date was like a drop of water waiting for freedom. It was like undergoing Chinese water torture because it is the waiting for the next drop that drives you crazy. You wait for a court date, your lawyer, the judge, the money, the spouse, the acceptance, love of people, and wait and wait for this hell to be over. Sometimes words cannot sufficiently describe the dreary atmosphere and the feeling of loss and listlessness in the family court.
My routine in the court remained exactly the same. When my lawyer would arrive, we would go inside the court and listen to some nonsense from the judge about settling the matter amicably. He would also talk about disposing some new minor petition in my matter which was a frivolous petition filed by my soon-to-be ex-husband’s family to delay the proceedings. We would then present our answer, after which they would counter it, and so the whole interminable whirlpool continued to spin. When this petition was dismissed, my lawyer and I would file a frivolous petition asking for the inspection of some papers. Clearly, we weren’t going to back off and stop filing frivolous petitions. The game of cat and mouse becomes catch me if you can. It is amazing how these petitions can delay a case for up to six months at a time – it gives you a real perspective on the sheer amount of time involved in divorce cases.
Both, my soon-to-be ex-husband and I continued with these petitions for such a long time that by the time the main case came up for hearing, we each had about 2,000 pages worth of petitions in our files, and they were all filled with junk. I could précis all of that in less than 100 words, maybe even twenty-five. Does anyone care about the system? Nope, each litigant, lawyer and every person in India who has had even a brief interaction directly or indirectly with the legal system has millions of excuses right from the ever-increasing population to not having enough judges. But no one questions the system or tries to change it. If the law minister couldn’t provide a principal for the Government Law College in Mumbai for a number of years, what hope do we have of changing this system?
What happens to us poor litigants in all this? It seems unfair that we come into the divorce courts as bright young people and leave as disgruntled and cynical adults having wasted, if we are lucky, fifteen years of our life here. The physical changes in our body from slim frames to thickened waists and wrinkled necks are obvious for all to see. These changes perhaps reflect the wizening of our souls as well. The mental changes are not visible but are far more devastating and far too numerous to enumerate, but it’s like surviving and learning to live again after a nuclear bomb. Can’t we logistically streamline the process of divorce or use alternate dispute resolution methods like arbitration and make them binding on a couple? They may be simplistic solutions but perhaps there is collusion in the system to avoid resolving divorces so that the judges can justify their jobs, the lawyers can loot their clients, and the villains can just file one stay order and have the matter in court for years.
The litigant also wastes her time, money and peace of mind in a fruitless exercise because sometimes when the judgment comes in, it’s too late and all the time wasted doesn’t make the entire process worth it. Of course, there is always the recourse to appeal the judgment, which wastes even more time. The appeal can go to the High Court and then Supreme Court and finally the judgment comes in and you are happy…that’s if you aren’t dead, if not physically then in all other ways.
Another heart-wrenching fallout of the socio-legal system of divorce in India is the absence of communication between the two parties unless it is through the lawyers. You can’t even be civil and say hello. The parties will, however, talk when there are accusations to be hurled. Every word is challenged in and out of court and each penny fought for and every insult traded and exchanged and all the drama. Everyone says “my marriage was unhappy from day one,” but I cannot understand why it takes people ten years and two kids to walk out.
But there are always a few poignantly humorous episodes in court: a woman took out a bottle of poison in the courtroom and in filmy style flung it at the lawyer before the judge, cursed her husband and said, “If you don’t give me my money, I will kill myself.” The poison was fake, but she made her point! Another woman came to court with her ‘boyfriend’ and it didn’t go down well with the judge. It was weird and everyone both inside and outside the courtroom kept wondering why on earth someone would come with her boyfriend to a court where she was divorcing her husband. The brazenness of it added to the foolishness and desperation of it. Another time, a woman openly called her mother-in-law a slut and proceeded to tell her father-in-law about all the men his wife was involved with! The poor man promptly engaged the son’s lawyer himself. There was another time that a clerk went on long leave and took up a job as a private detective to supply information about the cases to the respective parties. He never got caught, though. It was all happening in the divorce courts. They were like an epic movie packed with the ingredients of love, sex, humor, action, villains, vamps, heroes, heroines, item girls and the extras. But the question remains – how had the court impacted me?
The Ex-Files by Vandana Shah, Shobhaa De BooksMy appearance had gone from catwalk model to rat walk and it was when someone jeered at me, my looks and predicament, and said some very cruel words, that I snapped out of my morbid reverie. It is a tragic state that the courts put you in, and then because of the self-fulfilling prophecy, you become a court rat. You live the life, dress bad, look bad, and feel bad and of course, bad things happen to you. But that cruel jeer saved me; like they say, you can always turn around a negative into a positive. I decided I wanted no part of this misery and was determined to live a life. I would not just be defined by the start and finish line of court dates for the rest my life. I would live well and not mope at all. Whatever I would do, I would love my life and that would for sure be the best that I could do for myself. Like they say, the best that you can do for yourself is live well – because living well is the best revenge.
I cleaned up my entire appearance and also my mindset and I felt as shiny as a new penny. It took me six months of friend therapy, avoiding relatives, my lawyer, skipping a few dates, and praying until I felt healed and ready to take on the world. I was ready to be churned out as a brightly minted coin. No one was going to stop me whether it was my relatives, my detractors or my in-laws.

Rs 1.5 crore looted from cash van by robbersBikers shoot guard, loot Rs.1.5 crore in Delhi
By Indo Asian News Service | IANS –  Sat 29 Nov, 2014

New Delhi: Two robbers on a bike opened fire at a private company's security guard and took away about Rs.1.5 crore from a cash van in Delhi, police said Saturday.
"Two people came on a motorcycle and opened fire at the security guard and took away a bag containing around Rs.1.5 crore in cash," Joint Commissioner of Police Sandeep Goel told IANS.
The guard was identified as Govind, was shot on his head and chest. He later succumbed to his injuries in hospital, police said.
The incident took place around 11 a.m. when the cash van came to refill a Citibank ATM in north Delhi's Kamla Nagar market area, police said.
Govind was accompanied by another security guard and two bank employees.
The bikers, who were following the van, opened fire at him when he came out of the vehicle. They snatched away the bag being carried by the other guard and brandished their weapons in the air to escape, police said.
The van occupants told police there was more cash in the van which they had needed to refill other ATMs in the city.

Pakistan s state actors behind attacks in India: RajnathPrint
Guwahati:  Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh Saturday said state actors from Pakistan are playing a role in destabilising India.
Mentioning the gun battle that erupted Thursday in Jammu and Kashmir's Arnia sector, he said Pakistan's claim that "non state actors are behind such incidents is not true".
He was addressing the 49th All India DGPs and IGPs conference here.
Eleven people - four civilians, three soldiers and four militants - were killed in the fierce gunfight that ended Friday.
Rajnath Singh also raised the Islamic State (IS) issue at the conference and described the terror group as a "major security threat". "We are concerned about the fact that Indian youngsters are getting drawn to Islamic State."
The home minister said Al-Qaida is a serious threat and the central government has not taken it lightly.
"There may be many terrorist organisations in the world but the government will not allow them to get a foothold in India," he said.
He said "Muslims fought for India's freedom like Hindus did. Al-Qaida won't succeed in their motives."
On the Oct 2 Burdwan blast, he said the West Bengal Police and National Investigation Agency are playing crucial roles in the probe.
The blast took place at a house in Burdwan district's Khagragarh area, killing two Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh militants and injuring another.
Admitting that there was lack of development in the northeast, he said: "There is lack of development in northeast. Let me assure you, we are committed towards a comprehensive development of this region."
Singh urged all the northeastern states to fill up vacancies in the police forces and assured them of all possible help.
Directors general of police (DGPs), inspectors general of police (IGPs) from all states and union territories, heads of all paramilitary forces, officials from the Intelligence Bureau and all chief ministers of the northeastern states are taking part in the two-day conference.

Ministry claims previous allocations have not been spent
Leading economists and social activists on Saturday criticised the government for possible cuts in budget allocations in social sector programmes while avoiding both parliamentary discussion and public debate on the issue.
Citing The Hindu’s report on November 27 that the central government was proposing to cut expenditure on education by Rs. 11,000 crore and the budgets for the departments of Panchayati Raj, Rural Development and Sanitation by about 25 per cent, the activists demanded the government be more transparent regarding its proposals.
“The social sector allocations between 2004-05 and 2013-14 have remained stagnant if one considers economic growth over the same period. The Ministry of Finance’s argument is that there were unspent funds in social sector programmes. But our research has shown that by improving decentralized planning, funds flow from the Centre, and institutional capacity in States, this can be addressed. The government’s focus on Swachch Bharat, Skill India, Ganga rejuvenation, etc., should not mean it slashes funds from education, health, and rural development,” said Subrat Das of the Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability.
Economist and Jawaharlal Nehru University professor Jayati Ghosh cited the instance of MGNREGA allocations, pointing out that while the government had allocated Rs. 34,000 crore for the programme in 2014-15, up from Rs. 33,000 crore the previous year, it would prove inadequate as the government had not taken Rs. 9,000 crore pending to States as wages in the previous year.
Economist Prabhat Patnaik said with growth not projected to pick up, it was important to stimulate demand through more public spending. “Exports are reducing, manufacturing is stagnant, and budget cuts in social sector programmes at such a time will increase recessionary tendencies in the economy,” he said.
“The government has adopted a subterfuge process of carrying out cuts to the social sector budgets. This is an attack on democracy and will increase social unrest. They need to make this information public and let the public and the parliament debate this,” said Nikhil Dey, a social activist with the Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan, adding that people’s movements from across the country had planned a People’s Assembly on December 2 to raise the government’s attack on social programmes.

Washington: Your smartphone and other compact wireless devices could soon receive data twice as faster, thanks to a tiny new inexpensive circuit developed by researchers.
Researchers at The University of Texas at Austin created the radically smaller, more efficient radio wave circulator that could be used in cellphones and other wireless devices.
The circulator has the potential to double the useful bandwidth in wireless communications by enabling full-duplex functionality, meaning devices can transmit and receive signals on the same frequency band at the same time.

#smartphone #data sharing
The key innovation is the creation of a magnetic-free radio wave circulator.
Since the advent of wireless technology 60 years ago, magnetic-based circulators have been in principle able to provide two-way communications on the same frequency channel, but they are not widely adopted because of the large size, weight and cost associated with using magnets and magnetic materials.
Freed from a reliance on magnetic effects, the new circulator has a much smaller footprint while also using less expensive and more common materials.
These cost and size efficiencies could lead to the integration of circulators within cellphones and other microelectronic systems, resulting in substantially faster downloads, fewer dropped calls and significantly clearer communications.
The team of researchers, led by Associate Professor Andrea Alu, has developed a prototype circulator that is 2 centimetres in size - more than 75 times smaller than the wavelength of operation.
The circulator may be further scaled down to as small as a few microns, according to the researchers. The design is based on materials widely used in integrated circuits such as gold, copper and silicon, making it easier to integrate in the circuit boards of modern communication devices.
"We are changing the paradigm with which isolation and two-way transmission on the same frequency channel can be achieved. We have built a circulator that does not need magnets or magnetic materials," Alu said.
The device works by mimicking the way magnetic materials break the symmetry in wave transmission between two points in space, a critical function that allows magnetic circulators to selectively route radio waves.
With the new circulator, the researchers accomplish the same effect, but they replaced the magnetic bias with a travelling wave spinning around the device.
Another unique feature is that the new circulator can be tuned in real time over a broad range of frequencies, a major advantage over conventional circulators.
The research was published in the journal Nature Physics.

Israel: Biggest Jewish-Arab school set afire amidst tense situationBy: Press Trust of India | Jerusalem |
Posted: November 30, 2014 4:24 pm
One of Israel’s largest bilingual schools for Jewish and Arab children was set on fire in a suspected arson attack in southern Jerusalem, worsening the tense situation following the 50-day war with the Hamas. The incident comes amid growing tensions in Jerusalem between the two communities that started before the 50-day bloody war in Gaza and has continued unabated despite heightened security arrangements.
The fire broke out at the playground in the school on Saturday evening and was extinguished by emergency crews. Police and fire services said that they suspected arson based on the visible evidence found at the scene. The Max Rayne Hand in Hand Jerusalem School is the country’s largest Jewish-Arab institution. It has been co-run by a Jewish and an Arab principal since its foundation in 1998 by the Hand in Hand non-governmental organisation.
Over the past few months, the school has been repeatedly targeted by right-wingers, who have sprayed racist graffiti against Arabs on its walls, local media reports said. “Even if they manage to dirty the school’s walls, they will not manage to bring down our enterprise [of civil cooperation],” Hand in Hand Executive Director, Shuli Dichter, said in a statement.
“In addition to denouncing [these actions] expressing support, we invite the entire Israeli public to join us in the building of Jewish-Arab civil partnership in Israel. We will continue to develop our educational and social project, where every day 1,200 students come to study, some 200 teachers come to teach and in which thousands of family members are involved,” he said.
Jerusalem’s Mayor, Nir Barkat, condemned the incident saying, “We will not allow pyromaniacs and criminals who take the law into their own hands to disrupt our daily lives”. “We will continue to denounce the extremists and do whatever it takes to restore the quiet to Jerusalem,” he said.
The bloodiest war between the two sides broke out after the Hamas fired dozens of rockets at Israel after Israel rounded up its activists in the West Bank following the murder of three Israeli teens there. The war claimed lives of 2,200 Palestinians and 70 Israelis.

No compromise on security; BJP converted development into national agenda: Narendra ModiWritten by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati |
Posted: December 1, 2014 12:06 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 10:28 am
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday announced that his government would not compromise on national security and utilise land transfer agreement with Bangladesh in a manner that it serves the long-term security interests of the state. It might seem to be an immediate loss to Assam, but the state would benefit in the long run, Modi, allaying apprehensions over the Indo-Bangla land swap deal, said.
“The government will utilise the India-Bangla land transfer agreement to seal all routes across the international border through which illegal Bangladeshi migrants have been entering Assam and creating havoc in the state,” he said.
Addressing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers here at the end of his two-day hectic trip to Assam, Modi also claimed that his government has been able to convert development into a national agenda prompting all other parties to push issues like caste, creed, religion and language to the back.

Asking the people of Assam to have faith in him, Modi said, “There will be no compromise on Assam’s security.” He also promised to fulfil the promises he had made to the people of Assam during Lok Sabha elections. “I know the sentiments of the people of Assam. We will always protect the interests of Assam and the country, he said. Modi however did not make any commitment on the Bangladeshi influx issue and carefully avoided recalling his announcemebt during the election campaign in April that Bangladeshi migrants would have to pack up afte May 16.
He however issued a stern warning to forces trying to harm the interests of Assam and the Northeast region and said that law would not spare them now. “Such forces should know that the government has changed in Delhi and the law will not spare them now,” he said. The development of the entire northeast region including Assam was a priority of his government, Modi added.
The Prime Minister also claimed that the BJP has compelled all other political parties to make development the prime issue instead of issues like caste, creed and region. “We have turned the issue of development into everybody’s agenda across the country,” he said. The country, Modi claimed, has seen performance and agenda of the government run by all others parties including the Congress, the Left parties, regional parties and coalitions and they have now seen the BJP-led government at the Centre.

Bigg Boss 8 : Sonakshi Sinha shakes a leg with Salman Khan; interacts with housematesWritten by Sonal Gera | New Delhi |
Posted: November 30, 2014 6:19 pm | Updated: November 30, 2014 11:44 pm
Putting all rumours and in Sonakshi Sinha’s terminology ‘fiction’ to rest, the actress makes an appearance in tonight’s episode of ‘Bigg Boss’, hosted by Salman Khan and does an impromptu jig with him.
There have been rumours afloat that Salman and Sonakshi have had a fallout at Arpita’s wedding reception which left Sonakshi crying bitterly at the party. Sonakshi had quashed those reports in her tweet that said it was nothing but a fiction and deserved a read.
Leaving those said-unsaid things behind, the actress turns up on the show tonight hosted by Salman to promote her upcoming movie ‘Action Jackson’ in which she co-stars with Ajay Devgn, Manasvi Mamgai and Yami Gautam. The actress will be seen shaking a leg with Salman Khan to few songs including one from ‘Dabangg’ where she made her Bollywood debut opposite Salman.
Not only this, Sonakshi also visits the house and interacts with them. It’s reported that she has a special activity planned for the inmates.
When asked about her favorite contestant from the house, Sonakshi is reported to have taken RJ Pritam Singh’s name. RJ Pritam, apparently, has been one of the favorites of all the celebrities who have visited the house.
Meanwhile, the chaos inside the house continue to prevail despite Salman’s best efforts to show the contestants some light. While Ali Quli Mirza is now being targeted for his indecent behaviour towards the women in the house and inmates in general, the groupism inside the house is deepening to the darkest levels.
Also, in tonight’s episode the evicted contestant will finally be revealed. Renee Dhyani, Praneet Bhatt and Sonali Raut still have the danger lurking over their head.

No immediate need for capital to fund business growth, says Bajaj Allianz CEO
New Delhi, November 30:  
Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance will take a call on listing of its shares in bourses only after the proposed insurance law is passed in Parliament, Managing Director and CEO Anuj Agarwal said.
“We will wait for the final wordings of the new law and then decide whether or not to go ahead with listing or an initial public offering,” he told BusinessLine here when asked about his company’s listing plans. The private life insurer is “comfortably” capitalised as on date and there is no immediate need for capital, he added.
Product launch
Agarwal was in New Delhi for the launch of ‘Retire Rich’, a unit-linked deferred pension plan. Given the increasing life expectancy, Retire Rich has an increased maximum age limit at entry to help one live a worry-free post retirement life, he said.
While the minimum entry age for the policy is set at 30 years, the maximum entry age has been capped at 73 years.
The plan offers the Pension Builder Fund, which provides capital appreciation by investing in a mix of debt and equities.
Vesting benefit
On surviving till the vesting date, the fund value will be available as vesting benefit.
The vesting benefit will not be less than the guaranteed vesting benefit of 101 per cent of the total premiums paid.
“In India, there has been a substantial change in retirement trends and an increase in life expectancy.
“Retire Rich plan is best suited for customers looking for secure and stable returns over a long term horizon of 10-40 years,” Agarwal said.

IndiGos Q2 load factor dips below industry averageIndiGo’s Q2 load factor dips below industry average
K Giriprakash
Highly discounted fares of competitors could be the reason
Bengaluru, November 28:  
Low-cost airline IndiGo, perhaps the only profitable airline in the country, has seen its load factor dip below the industry average in the second quarter of this fiscal. For the quarter, the airline’s average domestic passenger load factor was 73.3 per cent compared with the industry average of 74.8 per cent, largely because of aggressive pricing by some of its competitors. Although the load factor increased in October to 76.2 per cent, the trend of trailing average load factor continued. The average industry domestic load factor for October was 77.6 per cent.
Financial performance
Sources in the airline said that during the second quarter, IndiGo’s financial performance took a hit as well. The airline does not disclose its financial performance as it is a privately-held company.
SpiceJet was able to increase its load factor even during September, historically the leanest month of the season, largely because of its market stimulation drive through reportedly well fenced, highly discounted fares on almost all its sectors that aimed to fill up seats that would have otherwise flown empty.
Companies such as SpiceJet and AirAsia India have rolled out highly discounted fares during the last few months.
But with SpiceJet’s Boeing fleet reduced to the twenties from thirties, as acknowledged by the airline, the airline’s capacity in November and a part of December has reduced, resulting in around 50 flights in its winter schedule being cancelled.
November and December are historically the peak months for domestic air travel. IndiGo, which received its 100th Airbus A320 November, and recently an additional Airbus A320 on short-term lease from ailing Singapore-based Tigerair, has deployed sufficient capacity to absorb the demand that SpiceJet may not be able to cater to.
With this, it may be the turn of IndiGo and a few others to increase their load factor now.
IndiGo today has the highest number of aircraft serving domestic routes. It has a fleet of 85 A320s, of which, one is short-term leased from Tigerair, while 84 are from the airline’s first order of 100 placed with Airbus in 2005. All 100 aircraft were inducted through a sale-leaseback arrangement. Of these, 16 aircraft were sent back to the lessors after the conclusion of a six-year sale-leaseback contract. The airline hopes to receive its Airbus A320NEO aircraft starting late next year.
IndiGo operates 548 daily flights connecting 36 destinations, including five international cities. International flights constitute 11 per cent of the total capacity deployed by the airline.
An analyst pointed out that SpiceJet’s market stimulation drive forced other airlines to respond with low fare sales as well, but Indigo may have not been able to stimulate the market to its full potential, resulting in the trailing load factors.
“IndiGo’s load factor dipped below the industry average for the entire quarter for the first time in its operating history. But IndiGo is set to strongly benefit in November and December because of the planned cancellation of certain flights by SpiceJet,” he said.

111 tie knot in Surat massweddingBy: Express News Service | Surat |
Posted: December 1, 2014 4:38 am
A mass marriage function of “Lagna Nu Vavetar” here on Sunday evening saw chanting of vedic slokas on one side and Quranic verses on the other. The wedding was of 111 girls of which three were Muslim and married as per Islamic rituals.
The newly-wed couples were blessed by religious leaders like Sadhvi Rutambara, political leaders and community people. It is to be noted that in the case of a few girls Mahesh Sawani, owner of P P Sawani group, acted as father and carried out all the marriage ceremonies.
Gujarat Chief minister Anandiben Patel who was scheduled to attend the function failed to turn up due to viral fever but she sent a message and blessed the couples.
The programme was organised by P P Sawani group, which runs five schools and a multi-specialty hospital. The family members of both bride and groom were present in the small pandal made in the huge ground, where hindu priests carried out the ceremonies as per ritual. The nikah ceremony was organised on the main stage in the presence of dignitaries of different political parties and religious leaders.
Sawani remained present in the pandal and blessed the girls. After the nikah, the newly wed were blessed by political and religious leaders.
Among the dignitaries present were Governor Vajubhai Wala, BJP central and state-level leaders and Minister Purshottam Rupala, Mangubhai Patel, Bharatsinh Parmar, Jayesh Radadia, Ranjeet Gilitwala, alogng with Sadhvi Rutambara, Swami Narayan. BJP sources said that CM Anandiben Patel could not attend the function due to ill health but her message to the couples was conveyed on the mike. In her message she also praised the initiative by Sawani.
A representative of the Guinness Book of World records Eva was also present on the main stage. Eva gave a certificate of world record to Sawani, for mehendi (heena tattoo) being done on 521 girls in the Abrahma farm.  All the politicial leaders, in their speech, appreciated the step taken by Sawani group for such a noble cause. Sawani said, “We have borne all the expenses of all these girls  and I personally remained present, like their father, in each pandal. I am thankful to the family members of all the people who attended the ceremony and even the political personalities. We started such functions in 2007 with two girls and now we have reached 111 girls. We will continue the trend in coming years.”

Expansion projects of Mercedes-Benz  FiatclearedWritten by Nisha Nambiar | Pune |
Posted: December 1, 2014 5:38 am
Clearing proposals submitted by auto giants Fiat and Mercedes-Benz for their expansion projects, the State Environment Assessment Committee has set a condition. They should build toilets in 53 schools and supply clean water to 50 schools without using electricity, as their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).
The State Environment Assessment Committee (SCAC) cleared the proposals after considering their likely impact on environment, along with certain pointers to compensate for the “externality” — the pollution additional production of vehicles would bring in with more vehicles hitting the roads.
The expansion project of Mercedes-Benz India Ltd at MIDC, Chakan, Phase III will roll out 9,000 more vehicles. Fiat India Automobiles expansion project at Ranjangaon will increase production by 10,000 vehicles. Looking at the increase in pollution this could cause, the committee under SEAC incorporated the conditions.
“They are making more vehicles and should carry out corporate social responsibility for pollution caused. The SEAC directed these companies to follow norms. They have to provide toilet facilities and clean drinking water without using electricity,” said an official.
“While Fiat will have to provide toilet facilities for 53 schools in the district, the other auto giant will provide drinking water at about 50 schools,” said environment department officials.
The auto giants had sought clearances for the projects about two months back and they were cleared in the 89th meeting of SEAC recently. In a detailed Environment Impact Assessment report all aspects of air and water pollution, as well as water treatment, paint shops were studied for likely impact on environment. The proposals were cleared after declaring that all aspects were satisfactory.
Fiat is spread on 8.5 lakh square metre area at Ranjangaon, and Benz on 4 lakh square metre at Chakan.
Meanwhile, the Union government on Wednesday agreed to set up an environment regulator vested with powers to appraise industrial projects but with no powers to penalise violators. This follows inter-ministerial and inter-state consultations over the months after an SC order to set up an autonomous body for appraising and penalising offenders.

Gang war: Day after  2 Marne aidesheldBy: Express News Service | Pune |
Posted: December 1, 2014 5:35 am
Two persons who are allegedly members of the Gajanan Marne gang, were arrested on Sunday in connection with the murder of Amol Hari Badhe of Hanuman Nagar, known to be an active member of the Nilesh Ghaywal gang.
Two more persons, Santosh Nagu Kamble and Lakhan Lokhande, were also injured in the incident in Navi Peth on Saturday. Kamble has told the Vishrambaug police that Marne himself was present at the time of the attack. Those arrested have been identified as Vishal Shrirang Dimbale alias Gotya (25) and his brother Sagar (24).
The three – Badhe, Kamble and Lokhande – had come to Navi Peth area to attend a funeral at Vaikunth Crematorim. Later, the three were going towards Rajendra Nagar on their bike when they were intercepted by some members of the Gajanan Marne gang. Their four-wheeler knocked the bike down, and the three fell on the ground. The members of the the Marne gang opened fire but the trio got up and tried to flee. Some Marne gang members on motorcycles opened fire at them again.
Badhe was shot in the head while two others escaped the attack with stab injuries. On November 4, Santosh Hiraman Gawade (28), a close aide of Nilesh Ghaywal, was killed in Lavale and Marne was named in the FIR. Other suspects named in the FIR on Saturday’s incident are Balaji Kadam, Rupesh Marne, Vicky Bandal, Sagar Rajput and Vicky Samudre.

HIV-positive: Match-making site ignites weddinghopesBy: Express News Service | Pune |
Posted: December 1, 2014 5:32 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 5:33 am
It was 14 years ago that he tested positive for HIV.  “It was in 2000 that I learnt about it,”says Raj G (name changed). It seems like yesterday, he says. Having put a broken marriage behind his back, a match-making site has ignited interest in him to find an HIV positive life partner.
He is banking on http://www.positivesaathi.com , which has more than 5000 members and has helped over 400 people living with HIV to find soul mates. The portal founders have organised a meet for members registered on their site. On Sunday, ahead of World Aids Day (December 1) the space outside Regional Transport Office was transformed into a dais for patrons who arrived for the meet.
Deputy Regional Transport Officer Anil Valiv who founded the website in October 2006, says that they have come a long way. The portal has gone on to register over five-and-a-half thousand members. “We organised this event to give a platform to members to meet fellow members. If it culminates in a wedding, we help them secure services of NGOs, doctors, lawyers and other facilities,” he says.
Meena Bhat (name changed) in her 20s, says, “I was diagnosed with the condition since birth. I been leading a healthy life since then. It’s not easy to accept at times, but the important part is not to lose hope. Acceptance is not easy in society. A normal life and marriage was a distant reality.”
A doctor and a hypnotist instilled optimism in the visitors.
The websites has had its share of trouble. Anand Shinde, a technician says, “Verifying all registrations was not easy. There were fake profiles, multiple profiles, and profiles of married people. We had to clear the database twice, and send emails to members to re-register. Members often want boys or girls from their own caste. There were cases where marriages have broken because one member was a vegetarian and the other a non-vegetarian. Another barrier is religion.”

A brief musical history of the OsmondsBy Amy Argetsinger November 30 Follow @AmyArgetsinger
(Photo by GAB Archive/Redferns/Getty Images)
Was there ever an act like the Osmonds? Not only did they make the leap from child stars to adult performers, they dabbled in an insane variety of genres — from barbershop to disco – that would have put Spinal Tap to shame. They were squeaky-clean Mormons who, by all accounts, never indulged in the better-known temptations of showbiz. Their hair and teeth were downright Kennedyesque. And their heyday, of course, was the 1970s, so the clothes and the choreography were just to die for. Here, in 13 songs, your introduction to everyone’s favorite family band. (** Donny and Marie Osmond: Cheerfully embracing their teen-idol past **)
1. After being discovered as kids doing an adorable barbershop quartet routine at Disneyland , four of the older Osmond brothers (Alan, Wayne, Merrill and Jay) made their debut on the Andy Williams Show in 1962 . They became regulars, and soon 5-year-old scene-stealing Donny joined act. Here he makes his first appearance singing “Yes, Sir, That’s My Baby.” Before you knew it, they had added tap dancing to their routine.
 
2. After a seven year run with Andy Williams, the brothers decided to make a move into pop music. It was hard to shed the variety-show image, but they managed to work with the legendary Muscle Shoals R&B production team. The result was their first number-one hit, “One Bad Apple,” in 1971. Merrill sang lead with 13-year-old Donny hitting the high notes on the chorus. Hmmm, do they sound like another band of brothers? Apparently, this song was originally written with their pals, the Jackson 5, in mind.
 
3. It wasn’t long before Donny was increasingly pushed out in front, taking lead on bubblegum tunes like “Sweet and Innocent” and “Go Away, Little Girl” – which you get to see them sing here at the 1972 Ohio State Fair in 1972, in these spectacular Elvis suits. True story: Donny used to have roadies track down the cute girls he spotted in the audience and bring them backstage. . . so he could talk to them.
 
4. But already, the older Osmonds were craving a heavier sound. The first time you hear it, you’ll probably cringe. The second or third time, you’ll admit it’s kind of catchy. By the fourth or fifth time — it will be your new favorite song. By the sixth or seventh time – and there will be a sixth and seventh time — you’ll wish you were an Osmond, too. Look at how much fun they’re having, rocking out in their flares, Donny tearing up the keyboard. You get the feeling he’d much rather have spent the rest of the 1970s in a garage band. (Also from this era: The proto-bro country “Down By the Lazy River,” and their famous Saturday morning cartoon .)
 
5. How did Marie end up in country music? At 12 years old, she took a long look at the pop world and decided it was too rough on young women. “Then Loretta Lynn came along, I thought, my gosh, this woman can write her music, she can be a mother, she can have hit records she can be married, you don’t have to be single and have a career for three years if you’re lucky. . . I saw that women were really treated wonderfully well, and so I went into country music.” Seriously, 12 years old, that girl. So she went to Nashville and promptly recorded a No. 1 single. Here she is, 13 and gorgeous, singing that song, “Paper Roses.”
 
6. This may have been the most regrettable recording of Donny’s career, his 1972 cover of Paul Anka’s “Puppy Love” – the one that branded him for years as a smarmy teen idol – but this 1974 performance is epic. It’s in the UK, where Osmondmania may have been higher than even in the U.S., and he’s totally owning that room. (“Someone help me! Help me please!”) Also: That white suit.
 
7. Jimmy Osmond was the youngest, a cherubic brassy-voiced tyke who was more a sidekick than an official member of the Osmonds band – but he was the first Osmond to score a gold record (for a single he recorded in Japan), and to this day, still holds the record for the youngest performer (9 years old) to hit No. 1 in the U.K., with “Long Haired Lover from Liverpool,” a kind of musical-hall/novelty tune, in 1972. He now oversees a lot of the family’s business interests, and he recently took over the old Andy Williams theater in Branson, Mo. Instead of writing his memoirs (“I’m too young, and I’m not that interesting!”), he penned a semi-autobiographical kids book, “The Awesome Possum Family Band.”
 
8. But it had already been decided: The future of Osmond Inc. was Donny & Marie, starting with “I’m Leaving It All Up To You,” a big hit for them in 1974. (See also: “Morning Side of the Mountain.” )
 
9. As warned in the main story , the opening sequence of the first episode of Donny & Marie’s variety show, where they sing “That’s the Way” is mortifying. You’ll probably want to watch it six or seven times. (You can even see the entire episode . It is bonkers. I had completely forgotten about the ice skaters. With special guest stars Lee Majors, Paul Lynde, Karen Valentine, and everyone else you hadn’t thought about since 1979!)
 
10. Of course, their trademark became the concert segment, better known by the theme song: “I’m a Little Bit Country, I’m a Little Bit Rock’n’Roll.” Self-explanatory. Donny, who did not love the slapstick comedy part of the job, says he most enjoyed going into the studio to work on this segment every week.
 
11. Marie didn’t have much trouble rebounding after the show was canceled. Country radio welcomed her back, and in 1985, she scored a No. 1 hit and a CMA Award for “Meet Me In Montana,” her duet with Dan Seals. (See also: “There’s No Stopping Your Heart.” )
 
12. It took Donny years longer, but he found an unlikely mentor after a chance meeting with Peter Gabriel, who steered him to the team that got him on track with “Soldier of Love.” Fun fact: This first became a U.S. radio hit in 1989 when an NYC station played it without identifying the singer at first. Note that the singer is a far better dancer than the models here.
 
13. The comeback was complete in 1992, when he stepped into the lead role in “Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,” touring with the stage production for six years. Ever the trouper, Donny gamely rocked both long hair and a loincloth.

New Delhi: The Prime Minister's Office has disclosed partial details of files related to freedom fighter Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose but has decided not to make these filed public. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led government has maintained that a disclosure of the classified files on the mysterious disappearance and related matters of Netaji could have an impact on diplomatic relations.
The disclosures have been made in response to an RTI filed by activist Subhash Chandra Agarwal. "The government has just given me the subject matter but not the copies. I had asked for both. The response is partially satisfactory. What is the government scared of," he asked adding that he has filed the first appeal and will the continue the fight till he gets the copies.
"Disclosure of documents contained in these files would prejudicially affect relations with foreign countries. As such, these files are exempted from disclosure under Section 8(1)(a) read with Section 8(2) of the Right to Information Act," the PMO has said in its reply to RTI activist Subhash Agrawal.

In January when the Lok Sabha election campaign was at its peak, the then BJP president Rajnath Singh, during a visit to Cuttack - the birthplace of Netaji - on the occasion of his 117th birth anniversary, had demanded that the UPA government make public the records related to the freedom fighter.

Singapore, Dec 1:  
Crude oil prices fell further in Asia today to new multi-year lows, continuing a steep selloff sparked by OPEC’s decision to maintain crude output in an oversupplied market.
US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for January delivery dipped USD 1.55 in early Asian trading to USD 64.60, its lowest intraday level since July 2009.
Brent crude for January sank USD 1.84 to USD 68.31, below the psychologically important USD 70 level.
“Negative actions in the oil market are continuing today.
Investors see crude as remaining vulnerable after last week’s OPEC announcement,” Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, told AFP.
“We have not yet seen any piece of news or development that could trigger a bottoming out phase in oil prices,” he added.
The unabated price plunge comes after the 12-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) opted November 27 to maintain its collective output ceiling at 30 million barrels per day, where it has stood for three years.
OPEC refused to cut production despite a glut of supplies that has sent prices tumbling by more than a third since June, with analysts warning of further falls to come.
The news dragged WTI down USD 7.54 in New York on Friday, compared with the settlement price on Wednesday, to end at USD 66.15 a barrel. US floor trading was closed Thursday for a holiday.
Brent meanwhile had settled at USD 70.15 on Friday, down USD 2.43 from Thursday’s close. It had earlier touched USD 67.90, its lowest intraday price since February 2010.

The government should contemplate the establishment of an Indian information technology service. The raison d’etre is the prime minister’s vision of a digital India. The service should not be cadre-based a la the other all-India services, but similar to the short service commission of officers into the armed forces. Recruitment should be competitive and limited to recent graduates from technical institutes. The tenure of office should be limited to between, say, two to five years. Further, the PM should appoint a national technology advisor (like the national security advisor) to oversee and coordinate the progress of e-governance.

MUMBAI: The S&P BSE Sensex opened on a positive note led by gains in pharma, tech and banks even as the Asian markets remained subdued. According to analysts, traders should be cautiously adding long positions as the market may consolidate in the near term.

Meanwhile, it's advisable to stick to a stock centric approach and trade with a proper exit strategy," said Angel Brokin note.
"If the momentum persists in the market then we may see an extended move towards 8650 - 8680 levels on the Nifty. On the flipside, 8500 - 8420 are seen as immediate support levels for the index," the note added.

Are you about to be sackedThese are topics LinkedIn Influencers weighed in on. Here’s what two of them had to say.
Robin Brodrick, senior HR operations coordinator at EMC and career coach at Talent Counseling
There are several tell-tale indications that you’re about to be sacked, wrote Brodrick in her post Four Signs You’re About to Get Fired and What to Do About It .
 “You find your job advertised online; your boss asks you to write standard operating procedures for everything to do; your day-to-day tasks slowly start getting reassigned to other people (or you’re asked to train others on how to do them ‘just in case’); you’re not being invited to meetings that you used to be included in,” she wrote.
Any of these sound familiar? Don’t panic. There are ways to figure out what’s really going on, Brodrick wrote.
“Schedule time on your boss’s calendar to speak with him or her,” wrote Brodrick, but don’t give them the topic ahead of time. “You don’t want to give your boss time to prepare for this conversation. You’re more likely to receive candid answers this way.”
Once you’ve got the meeting set, be prepared for some tough answers, Brodrick wrote.
Start the meeting simply: tell your boss you’re “seeing signs that people typically associate with getting fired and that you would like your boss to clarify the situation for you,” she wrote. “Now be quiet. Let silence be your weapon... just sit there and wait for their response.”
You’re likely to receive one of three responses, wrote Brodrick. The worst, of course, would be confirmation that you will be sacked. But, you might receive a good-news response — that the department is bulking up or putting new people in the pipeline in order to promote you, she wrote.
The third possibility, wrote Brodrick: “The company is advertising because they hear that you are looking for employment elsewhere, or because they feel like your workload is too much for one person and they want to add another member to the team.” If that’s the response, gauge whether the boss is telling the truth — and inquire more deeply about your responsibilities moving forward.
“No matter what your boss’s answer is, take the time to think before you reply,” Brodrick wrote.
Liz Ryan, chief executive officer and founder at Human Workplace
There are career blunders — and then there are near-fatal career blunders, wrote Ryan in her post The Five Deadliest Career Mistakes . The worst missteps can haunt you, or make it hard to push forward in your profession.
“Leaping without looking is the first deadly career mistake,” wrote Ryan. “Many talented and marketable people take the first job offer they get. They figure ‘any job is better than no job’ and undervalue themselves dramatically in the process.”
It makes sense, in some ways, explained Ryan. “On the one hand, they have an unexciting job offer. If they take it, they don't have to go on any more interviews, or worry about how to pay the rent,” she wrote. “If they pass on the offer, they remain open to everything the world might have in store for them, but they stay in Indecision Land a little longer. Most of us settle very quickly for a steady state over a state of flux, even when it hurts us to do so.”
The second deadly career mistake? Letting someone else run your career, wrote Ryan. This can easily happen when you’re in a company you like, but the milestones set for you don’t make sense or seem to be one more thing to do before the reward you already feel you’ve earned.
“An employer's plan for you, no matter how well-intended, is built with the employer's requirements in mind, not yours,” wrote Ryan. “If you're spending your energy hitting somebody else's yardsticks, you can easily lose track of your own path.”
The “third deadly career mistake is to burn bridges,” wrote Ryan. “When you get so fed up with a job that you have to leave, then go.”
And remember, you might not be so innocent. “You participated in creating the negative energy that you desperately want to escape right now. You've got a responsibility to disentangle yourself from the mess in an adult way,” Ryan wrote. “Unless you're being abused or are in an unsafe situation at your job, give two weeks’ notice on your way out. Smile, say only positive things and keep breathing. If you make less than a gracious exit, you're squandering whatever value your soon-to-be-former-job could add to your resume, not to mention your reputation.”

RBI policy to dictate mkt movement next weekRBI policy to dictate market movement next week
Dipak Mondal        Last Updated: November 28, 2014  | 19:54 IST
Equity markets closed the week with a bang as the National Stock Exchange (NSE) Nifty rose 1.1 per cent on Friday to close at 8,588 while the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) Sensex rose 0.9% to 28,694.
The markets were buoyed by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries'(OPEC's) decision not to cut crude oil production despite falling prices.
Lower oil prices mean India's current account deficit will shrink. The Nifty ended the week 1.31% higher than the previous week's close of 8,477, while the Sensex closed 1.27% higher than the previous week's close of 28,335.
The week started on a strong note as the European Central Bank began buying asset-backed securities, expanding its quantitative easing programme, and China cut benchmark rates for the first time in since July 2012.
Back home, investors welcomed the government decision not to appeal against the Bombay High Court decision in favour of Shell and Vodafone in a transfer pricing case. The industry and markets said this would help India gain the faith of foreign investors.
"The decision is a welcome relief not just for Shell but for all MNCs which have faced the adjustment on share issuance. It is significant to note that the court did not hesitate to exercise its extraordinary power to issue a writ where appeal remedy was available in this situation as the court felt that the tax department clearly exceeded its jurisdiction to bring to tax a capital transaction," said Mukesh Butani, Managing Partner, BMR Legal.
Among Sensex stocks, major gainers during the week were BHEL (12.05%), Hindalco Industries (8.59%), Mahindra and Mahindra (6.2%), Tata Power (5.56%) and SBI (5.38%).
The losers included ITC (-3.52%), L&T (-1.5%) and Bajaj Auto (-1.32%). ITC was hit by the government's decision to ban sale of loose cigarettes.
The buoyancy in large-cap stocks was not reflected in mid-cap and small-cap stocks. The BSE Mid Cap index rose 0.73% while the Small Cap index ended the week 0.5% lower than the last week's close.
Among  sector indices, the BSE Realty jumped 3.56% while the Bankex rose 2.56% during the week. PSU bank stocks gained on Friday as the government said it aimed to bring down its holding in PSU banks to 52%.
The mood was upbeat in the sector ahead of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) policy on December 2 .
"Banking stocks were in demand on hope of rate cut by the RBI in the next policy meeting.  The Bank Nifty closed higher by around 532 points (on Friday). Good demand and short covering helped the index outperform the broader market," says Alex Mathews, head of research, Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services.
Next week, a major trigger will be the RBI policy on December 2. Most analysts feel the central bank is unlikely to cut rates despite the fact that GDP growth slowed to 5.3% in the second quarter of the current financial year from 5.7% in the first quarter.
"The fiscal policy will remain tight, complementing the tight monetary policy maintained by the RBI. Moreover, notwithstanding falling crude oil prices and record-high equity markets, Indian Rupee (INR/USD) has weakened gradually towards 62, indicating potential future volatility. This makes it even more unlikely for the central bank to cut the policy rate next week and dilute the effects of ensuing fiscal tightening," Dhananjay Sinha, head, Institutional Research, Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd.

We may be on the verge of the sixth mass extinction.By Chris Mooney November 28 Follow chriscmooney

When we think about the concept of mass extinctions, we tend to think of something pretty dramatic. For instance, we now know that the dinosaurs were wiped out by a six-mile-wide asteroid that hit the Earth at thousands of miles per hour. Its impact, according to the new Smithsonian Channel documentary  Mass Extinction: Life at the Brink  (airing Sunday night), had the force of “a hundred million nuclear bombs,” unleashing tsunamis hundreds of feet in height that hurtled across the ocean "at the speed of a jet."
So yeah, that's pretty dramatic. And yet many scientists think that today we may be on the verge of another creeping mass extinction -- the sixth the planet has seen -- even as most people barely notice it happening.
Consider just one species highlighted by Mass Extinction: the African lion, or Panthera leo. There are some 32,000 to 35,000 lions left, according to a recent scientific estimate . But as of 1950, their numbers were vastly higher; one group of experts puts them at 500,000, and Mass Extinction uses the number 400,000. Either way, that's a 90 percent or more decline.
The lion numbers, stark as they are, are pretty solid, says  Anthony Barnosky , a biologist at the University of California-Berkeley who is featured in the film, and who authored the book Dodging Extinction: Power, Food, Money and the Future of Life on Earth .
"We know that from historic records of where lions used to be, and where they clearly are not any more. So it’s a combination of using the historical data about what we know distributions were over the past couple of centuries, combined with some very detailed studies, censuses of how many lions are out there in known populations over the past half century."
The chief cause of lion declines? "Indiscriminate killing in defense of life and livestock, coupled with prey base depletion," says the International Union for Conservation of Nature , which has the African lion on its "red list" of threatened species.
African lions aren't unique. A similar story, according to Barnosky, could be told about tigers, rhinos, and any number of other species. "We have killed about 50 percent of the world’s vertebrate wildlife in just the past 40 years," he says. "We've killed half the numbers of individuals. We've fished 90 percent of the fish out of the seas. So these are big things we’re doing to the world."
Mass Extinction examines both at the asteroid strike that killed off the dinosaurs 66 million years ago, and also the " Great Dying " at the end of the Permian period 252 million years ago, when some 90 percent of Earth's species vanished in the wake of massive volcanic eruptions in Siberia.
In each of these cases, the global extinction was caused not only by an immediate dramatic event, but by its subsequent effect on the planet's oceans and atmospheres. The asteroid impact led to so much smoke in the atmosphere that the sun's radiation was cut down dramatically, leading to great climatic changes. And the dramatic vulcanism that ended the Permian triggered global warming and ocean acidification by putting lots of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
In other words, these past extinctions have been tied to dramatic changes in the global climate. That is not the principal cause of the current extinction -- yet. So far, we've been threatening species by taking their habitat away for farming and for our growing populations. But global warming may now act on top of that.
"It's like adding a match to gasoline," says Barnosky.

(Government has welcomed…)
NEW DELHI: Russia has expressed interest in production of civil and light transport aircraft in India with their technology , Parliament was informed today.
The Indian government has welcomed the Russian interest and is committed to enhancing bilateral investment and trade cooperation, Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in a written reply to the Lok Sabha.
"The Russian side expressed their interest in production of civil aircraft, light transport aircraft and helicopter in India with Russian technology," she said.
The eighth session of the Indian-Russia Forum on trade and investment was held here on November 5.
Replying to a separate question on coffee industry, she said that stem borer pest is amongst major constraints affecting cultivation of Arabica variety of coffee.
"The combined effects of higher temperatures, reduction of shade for increasing the yield of pepper grown as intercrop and lack of timely control measures by the growers have led to increase in the incidence of the pest," she said.
About 3,200 hectares of productive area in Karnatka are reported to have been affected by stem borer due to long dry spell from November 2013 to May 2014 and resultant high temperatures.
She added that several steps have been initiated to address the problem of pest in coffee cultivation.
"The government has approved a two year action plan (2014-15 and 2015-16) for combating the stem borer in affected areas," the minister said.

BSE Sensex  NSE Nifty continue record-breaking runSpiceJet shares continue to plunge; down 17 pct
Continuing their rallies, the BSE Sensex and the CNX Nifty set new records during the week under review and closed at new closing highs of 28,693.99 and 8,588.25 respectively on sustained foreign fund inflows amid falling crude prices.
Global crude oil prices dropped to USD 72/barrel, the lowest level since August 2010. Falling oil price is good news for India, which imports 80 per cent of its requirements. This will also help the country narrow its Current Account Deficit as well as fiscal deficit.
Interest rates related shares from realty, banking and auto were in keen demand on hopes of rates cut.
IT, Metal and Power sectors too attracted good buying support.
The benchmark Sensex resumed higher at 28,413.01 and shot up further to intra-day life-time high of 28,822.37 before logging its new closing high of 28,693.99, a gain of 359.36 points or 1.27 pct during the week. It has gained by 2,585.46 points or 9.90 pct in six consecutive weeks.
The CNX 50-share Nifty also rose by 110.90 points or 1.31 pct to register its new closing peak of 8,588.25 after touching an intra-trade all-time high of 8,617.00. It gained 808.55 points or 10.39 pct in six straight weeks.
“Sentiments were buoyed by OPEC’s decision to sustain production levels and the subsequent sharp fall in crude prices. Markets are hoping for a rate cut in the RBI policy meeting next week,” said Dipen Shah, Head of Private Client Group Research, Kotak Securities.
Hopes of big-bang reforms in the ongoing winter session and growing expectations of more stimulus measures from China and Europe also boosted the market sentiment.
Sustained capital inflows also was the another factor behind rise in the share values as FPIs/FIIs continued their buying spree as they invested Rs 3,641.83 crs during the week.
Realty counters were at the forefront after Floor Area Ratio in Delhi in respect of plots of 750–1000 sq mt size were enhanced from the present 150 per cent to 200 per cent while the same has been increased from 120 per cent to 200 per cent for plots of 1000 sq mt and above.
As a result, sectoral S&P BSE Realty index was the top gainer with a rise of 3.56 per cent.
Major gainers from the sensex pack were Hindalco (8.59 pct), M&M (6.20 pct), Tata Steel (6.07 pct), Tata Power (5.56 pct), SBI (5.38 pct), Infosys (5.14 pct), HUL (4.31 pct), Hero Motocorp (3.77 pct), HDFC Bank (2.67 pct), Gail India (2.56 pct), HDFC (2.34 pct), Dr Reddy’s Lab (2.04 pct) Coal India (2.20 pct) and Wipro (2.16 pct).
Other gainers from the S&P BSE sectoral indices were IT 2.60 pct, Bankex 2.56 pct, Metal 1.61 pct, Auto 1.56 pct, Power 1.54 pct and Teck 1.39 pct.
The total turnover at BSE and NSE rose to Rs 20,862.31 crs and Rs 96,919.64 crs respectively during the week as against the last weekend’s level of Rs 17,604.23 crs and Rs 86,603.23 crs.

Rumours of live wire led to Patna stampedePrint
Patna: Rumours that a live cable wire had fallen as well as administrative lapses led to the Dussehra day stampede here that left 33 people, mostly women and children, dead, an official said Saturday.
"Rumours that a live cable wire had fallen near the exit of one of the gates of the Gandhi Maidan led to panic resulting in a stampede," Principal Home Secretary Amir Subhani told the media here, a day after a panel probing the stampede submitted its report to the state government.
A two-member inquiry commission, with Subhani and Additional Director General of Police Gupteshwar Pandey, was set up by the Bihar government to probe the stampede.
Subhani also said there were administrative lapses that contributed to the tragedy in which over 30 people were also injured.
"The Patna district administration, Patna police, Patna Municipal Corporation and Patna traffic police failed in their duty of crowd control management and other arrangements for holding such a big event," he said.
According to him, the lighting arrangements at the venue were inadequate and several officials including magistrates deployed on duty were missing at the time of the tragedy.
"We have recommended to the state government to take administrative and disciplinary action against officials responsible for these lapses," Subhani said.
Subhani and Pandey had recorded the statements of then Patna district magistrate Manish Kumar Verma and then Patna senior superintendent of police Manu Maharaj along with magistrates who were on duty at the Gandhi Maidan.
They also recorded the statements of the injured and collected information about the incident that occurred after the burning of Ravana's effigy.
The statements of the eyewitnesses and the relatives of the victims were also recorded in-camera at the two-day hearing conducted at the collectorate.
Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi had said the government would take action against officials if they are found guilty.

SRIHARIKOTA: Chennai-based Valeth Hightech is among the smaller companies that will be joining hands with behemoth's like Hindustan Aeronautics in ISRO's experiment aimed at being a precursor to India's first manned mission .
The company has machined the silica-based tiles that will shield a trapezoidal pod Indian Space Research Organisation will launch into space and bring back to earth in an experiment in December.
The attempt is to test new design features developed for its new-age launch vehicle GSLV Mk-III, which will enable India to launch its heaviest thus far - 4-tonne satellites. A capability that an elite club of US, Russia and China can boast of now.
"Many small companies have contributed to this mission, and Valeth's contribution is critical to the mission safety," says S Unnikrishnan Nair , one of the project directors for Crew Module Atmospheric Re-entry Experiment.
For ISRO , the challenge lies in frictional heat that can burn up the crew module as it re-enters the atmosphere from the 126-km high point it is expected to touch in this mission.
"The temperature as a result of earth's pull can reach up to 1,600 degree Celcius. To protect the crew module, heat shields are used," said Subba Rao, another scientist at Satish Dhawan Space Centre SHAR , Sriharikota.
Scientists said the silica cladding covering the module will keep temperature at a lower level. The entire duration of the experiment is close to 1,140 seconds.
The crew module is expected to splash at a point 180 km off Andaman and Nicobar in sea, from where it will be secured by the Indian Coast Guard.
The cost of the project is estimated at Rs 140 crore, with expenses on the crew module alone at Rs 15 crore.

Priyanka Chopra sends legal notice to spa ownerBy: BollywoodHungama.com | Mumbai |
Posted: November 30, 2014 10:30 am | Updated: November 30, 2014 2:38 pm
Recently the media was abuzz with reports that spa owner Manik Soni’s outlet in Versova had been raided by cops for the alleged involvement in the flesh trade. Now we hear that Priyanka Chopra who owns the property that had been leased to Charisma Beauty Spa outlet has sent the owner Soni a legal notice.
The raid came after the police received a tip off saying that the spa was being used as a front to run a sex racket. Following the tip the police deployed a decoy to verify the charges. This resulted in a raid where three adult females were rescued and the manager Dinesh Chandrakant was arrested.
Though shaken, Priyanka Chopra has been unavailable for comment, however her mother who also runs a clinic on the same floor stated that they have sent a legal notice to Soni as well as have cancelled the lease for the spa.
Did not know my property was being misused, says Priyanka Chopra
Actress Priyanka Chopra has sent a notice asking her tenants, who have been accused of running a sex racket on her property in Mumbai rented to them, to vacate.
Police had busted the alleged flesh trade earlier this month on her property, which Priyanka had leased out to a spa owner.
“It was shocking and little unnerving for me… You give so many properties which you put on rent and you don’t know what people are doing in their homes. Like that, I didn’t know what they were doing, it was just a property which went on rent. Right now the police are investigating. I don’t have much knowledge of it but my lawyers are keeping a track of it,” the actress told PTI.
The 32-year-old star said she has already sent a notice to the accused, asking them to vacate the property.
“It is a matter under investigation. Whatever the police say we will abide by that. We have sent a legal notice already and they will have to vacate,” she said.

ISRO to test crew module in Dec to put man in spaceTo put man in space, Isro to test crew module in December

SRO is taking baby steps towards sending man to space, with an experimental flight of a GSLV-Mark III all set to carry this 'crew module'.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
SRIHARIKOTA: Scientists at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota are busy integrating a brown bucket-like structure with a black lid mounted on a pedestal. Some day soon, they believe, an improved version of this would carry human beings to space.
Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) is taking baby steps towards sending man to space, with an experimental flight of a GSLV-Mark III all set to carry this 'crew module' as the payload in the second week of December. While the manned mission is at least 10 years away, a full-fledged flight of GSLV-MIII is still a couple of years away. The biggest rocket ever to be made by Isro , it can carry payloads up to four tones—a necessity in the coming days of heavy communication satellites.
For this, scientists are testing the indigenously developed cryogenic engine at Isro's Mahendragiri facility in Tirunelveli district. In the experimental flight called the LVM3-X/CARE mission , the cryogenic engine C25 will not be used.
"We will be having a morning launch for the experimental test flight on any day between December 15 and 20. The date will be finalized in another week," said SHAR director M Y S Prasad. The unmanned module to be used in Crew Module Atmospheric Re-entry Experiment (CARE) is to test the ability of the module to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere with thermal resistance, parachute deployment in cluster formation, aero braking system and apex cover separation procedures.
The crew module will be separated from the GSLV rocket at an altitude of 126km and will re-enter the atmosphere at about 80km. It will 'soft-crash' into the Bay of Bengal about 600km from Port Blair, and be retrieved by the Indian Coast Guard tracking its beacon signal. This will be the first time the module weighing more than 3,000kg will be tested for its atmospheric reentry and parachute deployment patterns from such high altitudes.
Isro's first space recovery experiment (SRE-1) module launched by a PSLV in January 2007 weighed just 555kg, and it was not a crew module. It re-entered atmosphere and was successfully collected from the Bay of Bengal.
"We will not be injecting any object into the orbit during this test flight. The crew module costs around Rs 15 crore and Rs 140 crore was spent on the GSLV Mark III components to be used for the test flight," said project director S Somanath.
CARE mission director Unnikrishnan Nair said so far the crew module has been tested by airdropping it from IAF choppers and the test flight will provide them a chance to actually map its trajectory, thermo resistance capacity of the exterior. The module will be packed with three separate sets of parachutes to be deployed in pairs, including a 31-metre diameter parachute which will be the biggest made in the country. Experts pointed out that manned missions in the future will involve similar crew modules, but with special chambers for life support.

Radio telescopes on Earth will beam 90,000 messages to Mars on Friday to commemorate the launch 50 years ago of the first robotic probe to visit the planet.
A US space funding company called Uwingu organized the extraterrestrial shout-out to mark the 50th anniversary of NASA's Mariner 4 mission and to raise funds for its other projects.
Uwingu's "Beam Me To Mars" initiative invited interested participants to send digital radio-wave transmissions of their names, messages and pictures to Mars for fees ranging from $5 to $99.
The effort attracted several celebrities including actor and comedian Seth Green and actor George Takei, who portrayed Mr. Sulu on the television series " Star Trek ."
The transmission is scheduled to begin just after 3 p.m. EST/2000 GMT on Friday. Traveling at the speed of light, the messages will take 15 minutes to reach Mars. The entire transmission will be repeated twice.
While there is no one on Mars to answer the call, project organizers say that is beside the point.
Copies of the messages will be delivered to Congress, to NASA headquarters in Washington, and the United Nations in New York as a show of support for space exploration.
"Though no one is on Mars yet to receive the messages, here on Earth people will hear them loud and clear," Uwingu wrote on the project website.
Uwingu, pronounced "oo-wing-goo" which means "sky" in Swahili, is a privately owned company that raises money to fund space research and educational outreach projects.
Since Mariner 4's successful flyby of Mars, returning the first pictures of the planet's surface, more than 20 other spacecraft have successfully visited, orbited or landed on the planet's surface.
NASA currently has three orbiters and two rovers working on Mars, and the European Space Agency and India each have one Mars orbiter.
The long-term goal of the US space program is to land astronauts on the Red Planet.

Mumbai  Kolkata most vulnerable to climate change: GovtTata Steel close to reopening its top iron ore mine
India’s populous coastal cities Mumbai and Kolkata are most vulnerable to loss of life and properties due to coastal flooding in the second half of the century, the government has said quoting a UN report ahead of a key global climate conference in Peruvian capital Lima.
The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned against extreme weather events like occurrence of heatwave, heavy precipitation, droughts, floods, cyclones and wildfire that cause damage to ecosystems and human systems in various regions, Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said.
“… India is among the top 20 countries and regions most at risk based on analysis of climate risk and coping ability. Mumbai and Kolkata will have the greatest population and assets exposure to coastal flooding in 2070,” he said.
The minister’s statement assumes significance at a time when representatives of governments are scheduled to meet in Lima from tomorrow for the Climate Change Conference to lay the foundation for an effective, new and universal climate change agreement in Paris in 2015.
Last week, the UN Environment Programme had underscored the need for global emissions to peak within the decade and then to rapidly decline so that the world can reach climate neutrality â€“ also termed zero net emissions â€“ in the second half of the century.
With climate change impacts worsening and affecting the poor and most vulnerable, governments urgently need to scale up adaptation to climate change, according to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
“Never before have the risks of climate change been so obvious and the impacts so visible. Never before have we seen such a desire at all levels of society to take climate action,” said Christiana Figueres, Executive Secretary of the UN Climate Convention.
Figueres said “it is hugely encouraging” that “countries have already been outlining what they intend to contribute” towards the climate action, referring to the recent agreement between China and the US to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Climate expert Chandra Bhushan, however, said the deal signed between China and the US “was not in line with the principals of the UN Convention”. In Lima, India must work harder with developing countries and push for an ambitious global deal which is equitable and saves the world from catastrophic climate impacts, he said.
“India must push for a principle-based emissions reduction target for all countries. This is the only way the world can remain within the planetary limits,” Bhushan said.
In a statement issued ahead of the Lima meet, Figueres said, “Never before has the society had all the smart policy and technology resources to curb greenhouse gas emissions and build resilience… We can be confident we will have a productive meeting in Lima, which will lead to an effective outcome in Paris next year.”
The UN has said, in Lima, all governments need to work towards streamlining elements of a draft agreement for Paris 2015 and explore common ground on unresolved issues in order to achieve a balanced, well-structured, coherent draft for the next round of work on the text in February next year.
The governments meeting under the “Ad Hoc Work Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action” (ADP) needs to define the scope and the type of contributions they will provide to the Paris agreement, along with clarity on how finance, technology and capacity building will be handled, it says.
Countries will put forward what they plan to contribute to the 2015 agreement in the form of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) by the first quarter of 2015, well in advance of the Paris conference in December.
The Lima conference needs to provide final clarity on what the INDCs need to contain, including for developing countries who are likely to have a range of options from, for example, sector-wide emission curbs to energy intensity goals.
According to Figueres, “countries are working hard to increase emission reductions before 2020, when the Paris agreement is set to enter into effect. Pathways on how to accomplish this will also be a key issue before nations in Lima.”
Union minister Javadekar will be part of the high-level Indian delegation to the Lima Conference.
In addition to progress made to date towards a Paris agreement, the political will of countries to provide climate finance is increasingly coming to the fore. At a recent pledging conference held in Berlin, Germany, countries made pledges towards the initial capitalisation of the Green Climate Fund totalling nearly USD 9.3 billion.

US keen for co-production in defence with IndiaBarack Obama
(Obama's visit in January, reflects…)
WASHINGTON: With India being one of the top priorities of the Obama Administration, the US is keen to explore co-production and co-development opportunities in defence with the rising Asian power and expand maritime security cooperation to further strengthen the strategic ties.
"We think there is a strong potential (in Indo-US defense ties). We want to translate that strong potential into action and reality. And that is desired on both sides," Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs Puneet Talwar said on the eve of his visit to New Delhi.
"The way you do that is coming to a closer understanding of the strategic picture. We see a natural convergence between India and the United States," he said.
Leading a high-powered inter-agency delegation, including officials from the State Department, Pentagon and the US Pacific Command, Talwar will travel to India from tomorrow to co-chair a political-military dialogue with senior officials from External Affairs and Defence ministries.
"We would be discussing, I hope, several topics of regional security in the Indo-Pacific region and we also want to get into discussion of defense trade as well," he said.
"What you have seen and what you will continue to see is that India is very high up on the agenda. We see a natural convergence between India and the US. We think it is really incumbent on us to try to explore this relationship and try to take as far as we possibly can because we see benefits not only for us, we see them also globally," he said.
"We think a strong India-US relationship would be good for peace, prosperity and security in the Indo-Pacific but also globally," he said in response to a question.
The talks will focus on regional and maritime security, defence trade, and new areas for strategic cooperation.
Referring to the significant increase in strategic and defense ties, he said defense trade relationship has now gone from virtually zero to $ 10 billion in less than a decade.
"It has grown significantly. We think defense cooperation can go much further and that's the signal we received from India. They would like to take it further and certainly we would like to as well," he said.
During his visit, Talwar will seek opportunities to further expand India-US security cooperation, including support for the Department of Defense's US-India Defence Trade and Technology Initiative.
"We want to talk about co-production and co-development opportunities. We have been working through the defense trade and technology initiatives on a number of potential projects where one could get into a very sophisticated kind of collaboration and co-operation," he added.
US aviation giant Boeing last week delivered the sixth P-8I maritime patrol aircraft to India, which is part of multi-billion dollar contract of eight aircraft.
  President Barack Obama's visit in January, Talwar said, reflects the high priority that his administration has placed on deepening and strengthening the partnership with India.
In India, Talwar will hold meetings with government officials in New Delhi, visit US-Indian joint ventures in the defense sector in Hyderabad, deliver remarks at the Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses, and hold a roundtable discussion with the US-India Business Council.
"We want to translate that, and try to narrow down into specific areas where we can have co-operation. Where we had discussions in the past and look forward to continuing them on the defense side in particular, are issues of co-production and co-development, as well as just understanding and explaining to India from our perspective and getting a better understanding of their perspective how defense procurement, defense trade and defense licensing systems work on both sides so that we can deepen our cooperation," Talwar said.
He would be accompanied by Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kenneth Handelman, who is in-charge of the directorate of defense trade control.
"We hope that would be beneficial conversation. Of course part of the goal of defense trade and technology initiative was to address what you were talking about (relaxing export control norms for India), to be able to put on the table certain projects which we can pursue that would involve very sophisticated areas," Talwar said.
"That conversation we would like to take to deeper level. We think more can be done there. And so this whole area of technology transfer should be one that we talk about and the kinds of systems that we do to explain our procedures and our policies in this area I think would be a useful exercise. This is the kind of conversation that we want to deepen with India," he added.

AgustaWestland deal investigation at  advanced stage : Manohar ParrikarAeromatrix
("The deal has been scrapped…)
NEW DELHI: Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar today said investigation into irregularities in the scrapped Rs 3,600 crore AgustaWestland deal is at an advanced stage.
"The deal has been scrapped and it is being probed...It is at an advanced stage of investigation," he said in the Lok Sabha during Question Hour.
The Minister was responding to a query related to the AgustaWestland issue.
In the wake of charges that kickbacks were paid to get the contract, India in January had cancelled the Rs 3,600 crore deal with Anglo-Italian firm AgustaWestland for supply of 12 VVIP choppers to the Air Force.
CBI is investigating the matter and had registered a case against former IAF Chief S P Tyagi along with 13 others, including his cousins and European middlemen in the issue.
As part of the probe, CBI had recorded the statements of former Intelligence Bureau Director and, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana Governor E S L Narasimhan. The agency had also questioned former NSA M K Narayanan and former SPG Chief B V Wanchoo, among others.
The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is also looking into the case.
Khaitan was earlier questioned by CBI in this case. ED had lodged a case in this deal under PMLA, taking cognisance of a more than a year-old CBI FIR.
ED has booked Tyagi, some of his family members, European nationals Carlo Gerosa, Christian Michel and Guido Haschke , six firms -- Italy-based Finmeccanica, UK-based AgustaWestland, Chandigarh-based IDS Infotech and Aeromatrix , two companies based in Mauritius and Tunisia, and unnamed persons in its criminal complaint.
The supply of 12 VVIP helicopters from AgustaWestland came under the scanner after the Italian authorities had alleged that bribes were paid by the company to clinch the deal.

The rebel rocketeer
You see, a few years before the TV series kicked off in the mid-Sixties, a man named Forrest Robinson decided to profess his love of Batman in the only way he knew how. By dismantling a car and remaking it in the image of the Caped Crusader's own whip.
Hardened Batman fans will remember that the original Batmobile was just a teardrop coupe from the 1930s, taken from the comics.
1963 Forrest Robinson Batmobile. (Heritage Auctions)
So Forrest (you're better than those Bubba Gump Shrimp Company jokes, you really are) started with a 1956 Oldsmobile frame with the classic ‘Rocket' 324 V8 engine underneath, slashed away the body and attached his own custom design.
The whole thing ended up measuring over five metres in length and over two metres in width, including the fin, ‘bat-nose' front end and pocket sliding doors. Upon presumably declaring ‘Look on my works, ye Mighty and despair!', Robinson painted it silver and used it as his personal car.

Then, of course, the Batman TV series began, and the public went a bit bat-sh-, well, you know what. Forrest's creation was bought up by a DC Comic Books company, repainted in official Bat colours and used for a short promotional campaign.
But then George Barris's car came good, and Forrest's one ended up being sold for just $200, before it lay abandoned for nearly 50 years. It was recently discovered, renovated and tarted up for sale.
It's being offered by Heritage Auctions, with bids starting from $90,000. That's lot for an old, um, Oldsmobile, true, but remember: it's not who you are underneath, but what you do, that defines you...

Not a single person blames Abbott: ClarkeBy: Press Trust of India | Melbourne |
Posted: November 30, 2014 11:21 am | Updated: November 30, 2014 12:46 pm
Australian skipper Michael Clarke has offered his full support to distraught bowler Sean Abbott, whose unfortunate bouncer led to the tragic death of young batsman Phillip Hughes.
     
The 22-year-old Abbott has been undergoing counselling ever since the accident took place during a domestic match at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Tuesday.
Clarke said no one blames Abbott for the unfortunate incident and the entire Australian team stands behind him and will support him in returning to the sport.
“I would like to say some words about Sean Abbott. This is a tremendous young man with a bright future whose life has changed forever by this accident.  And that’s what it is — a freak accident,” Clarke said.
“No-one — not one single person — blames him in any way for what has happened. He deserves our full support, he will absolutely have mine whenever he needs it, and I know that also goes for the entire Australian cricket community.
“Sean, when you feel like getting back on the horse mate, I promise you that I will be the first to strap on the pads and go stand up the end of the net to hit them back at you. It’s exactly what Hugh Dog would want us both to do,” Clarke was quoted as saying in ‘Herald Sun’.
Clarke, who was a close friend of Hughes, also paid glowing tribute to the young Australian and thanked his country men for their support during this crisis.
“I also want to take this opportunity to thank the Australian public for the wonderful words of support that Phillip’s family and team mates have received over the last several days. It’s really brought home to me what I guess I have always known- that all of us who love this game are a family — a big, wide, culturally diverse, passionate family,” he said.
“Nothing can temper the pain and devastation that the Hughes family are now experiencing. But I know that they have taken comfort in the extraordinary outpouring of prayers, tributes and deeds that have filtered down to them from all parts of the world,” Clarke said.
“I also would like to pay tribute to all those people of who touched Phillip’s life and helped him on his cricketing journey in some way. From his junior team mates, to the coaches up on the north coast who noticed and nurtured his prodigious talent, to the umpires who would have tired of signalling his endless 4’s through point.
“They are all part of the wonderful cricket family, and I am sure they are grieving Phillip’s passing deeply.
“The best qualities of Australians have come to the fore this week and I personally have been deeply moved,” he added.

 Rajan s Tryst With Tuesdays: Preferred Day for ReviewsBofA-ML Sees 0.25% Rate Cut in February on Easing Inflation
New Delhi: It may be sheer coincidence that all monetary policy reviews by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Raghuram Govind Rajan this fiscal year have taken place on Tuesdays and this would be the case for the upcoming review as well.
In the current fiscal year that began on April 1, 2014, Mr Rajan has undertaken four monetary policy reviews so far and the fifth would take place on December 2, with all these five being on Tuesdays.
The former chief economist of International Monetary Fund (IMF), who took over as RBI Governor on September 4, 2013, came out with four policy reviews during the previous fiscal year as well and two of them took place again on Tuesdays. The other two reviews by Mr Rajan last fiscal year were on Wednesday and Friday.
As a result, six out of eight monetary policies announced by him during his entire tenure so far have been on Tuesdays.
The ninth review, scheduled for this week, takes place on a Tuesday where the RBI is widely expected to keep the benchmark rate unchanged.
Incidentally, Mr Rajan has maintained the benchmark interest rate in all four reviews so far in the current fiscal year citing high inflation, even as there has been a growing clamour for rate cuts by industry, the government and economists among others.
Surprising the industry and analysts completely, the RBI Governor in his first policy review in September last year raised the short-term policy (repo) rate by 0.25 per cent to 7.5 per cent to keep "worrisome" inflation under check.
His fight against stubborn inflation gained pace the following month as well when he again hiked the repo rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 7.75 per cent.
Mr Rajan put a pause on rate hike on December 18, 2013 but said the RBI will hike interest rates if inflation does not subside in line with the expected declining trend.
Not happy with the inflation trend, the RBI did hike repo rate by 0.25 per cent the very next month that is in January 29, 2014 by 0.25 per cent to 8 per cent. Since then, the apex bank has left its benchamark rate unchanged despite pressure from all quarters.

Sebi to Launch Consultation for Promoter Re-ClassificationOil Slumps Near $59 for First Time Since 2009 on Oversupply
Mumbai: Adopting a key non-legislative recommendation of the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission (FSLRC) for overhaul of financial sector regulatory framework, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is launching public consultation for framing rules to allow re-classification of promoters at listed firms looking to become public shareholders.
The new norms can have a significant impact on the way some merger and acquisition deals are structured, as also in cases involving corporate restructuring that take place due to disputes among members of business families or after settlements between rival corporates.
Some of the scenarios where such re-classification has already been sought by promoters include cases of split in a promoter family, a main promoter selling majority stake to another investor, marriage between members of rival business families and a promoter group wanting to exit from day-to-day operations of a listed company.
While the government is looking to implement many legislative and administrative recommendations of the FSLRC in days to come, it has asked regulators including Sebi to begin adoption of governance-enhancing and non-legislative suggestions made by this panel on a proactive basis.
Consequently, Sebi has decided to frame all its major policy decisions after a public consultation process, as suggested by the FSLRC, a senior official said.
"As the change in process of reform continues ... I have not the least doubt that a large number of these (FSLRC) recommendations will actually see implementation in the days to come," Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said at a seminar organised by the BSE on Saturday.
While Sebi has been framing most of its key regulations after a public consultation over the draft norms, it would now onwards follow this procedure for all policy matters having any significant implications for various market participants.
As part of the new procedure, Sebi would make necessary amendments to its existing regulations governing re-classification of promoters after finalising a policy in this regard pursuant to a public consultation process.
Among others, amendments might be required to the regulations governing takeovers, listing norms and the disclosure rules applicable to listed companies, the official added.
A discussion paper containing draft regulations for re-classification of promoter as public shareholders, which have been finalised after detailed deliberations by Sebi's Primary Markets Advisory Committee, would be soon put in public domain for comments from all stakeholders.
The paper would also detail the various scenarios and conditions under which a promoter or promoter group can be reclassified as a public shareholder.
At present, the regulatory framework does not prescribe any specific criteria for such re-classification, which Sebi feels is required to lend objectivity to the process of reclassification of promoters of listed companies as public shareholders under various circumstances.
One of the scenarios include an existing promoter group entering into an agreement with a new group of investors for sale of a substantial stake and expressing its intention to become a public shareholders after giving away all special rights and privileges enjoyed by them.
In another case, daughter of one of the promoters of a listed company gets married to a family member of a business rival and wants to reclassify her status as a public shareholder.
The other test case presented by Sebi involves a promoter deciding to sell a majority of his or her stake to a new strategic investor looking for a controlling stake, and then retaining a minority stake along with position of chairman.
The new norms would specify whether a re-classification can be permitted in such cases.
The other such scenarios encountered by the regulator include two family members, having jointly promoted various companies, deciding to go through a family separation.
The agreement involves one family member giving majority control to the other and the vice versa, and thereafter one promoter seeking public shareholder status in companies where he has given majority control to the other family member.
There can also be a case where a business family and promoter of a listed company decide to exit from the day-to-day operations and retain only a minority stake without any special rights while handing over the management to professionals.
The norms for whether such promoters, as also in other possible cases, should be allowed to reclassify themselves as public shareholders would be finalised after the detailed public consultation process, the official added.

Kohli  Shastri  Fletcher to attend Hughes  funeralBy: Press Trust of India | Adelaide |
Posted: November 30, 2014 5:49 pm
Stand-in skipper of the Indian team Virat Kohli will attend the funeral of Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes on Wednesday.
He will be joined by team director Ravi Shastri, coach Duncan Fletcher and team manager Arshad Ayub.
Three or four other Indian players are expected to join them and a final decision will be made once the team reaches Brisbane on Monday.
The funeral will be held on Wednesday, December 3, in Hughes’ hometown of Macksville.
The left-handed batsman died on Thursday after being hit by a bouncer in a Sheffield Shield game two days prior, sparking an outburst of emotion throughout the country.
India’s two-day tour match against Cricket Australia Invitational XI at Adelaide Oval this past weekend was cancelled as a result.
The team continued to stay over in the city till Sunday holding regular practice sessions in preparation for the Test series.
Sunday would have been the late cricketer’s 26th birthday and as such the solemn mood continued to be observed by one and all.
Australian skipper Michael Clarke wrote a special tribute  to his former team-mate.
Cricket Australia too edited the score-card from that Sheffield Shield game between New South Wales and South Australia, changing Hughes’ status from ‘retired hurt’ to ’63 not out’.
The Australian governing body has been full of praise for the understanding and patience the BCCI and the visiting team have shown in this sad circumstance.
Attending the funeral is another step for the Indian contingent to show solidarity to their hosts at such tragic time.
They had earlier practised away from the Adelaide Oval on Friday as a mark of respect, holding a closed net session, wearing black arm-bands.
On Saturday, before practice, Kohli had ‘put out’ one of his bats as well as his India cap outside the Adelaide Oval, paying tribute to the late cricketer.
However, the uncertainty over the first Test continues .
It was learnt that Cricket Australia had first sought a one-day postponement to the Test because their players wouldn’t have been ready to play on Thursday.
The Indian team was informed of this and they did not make any changes to its planned departure for Brisbane.
Later yesterday evening, the visiting contingent was also made aware of the possibility of the complete cancellation of the Test match, but subject to playing the game at a later date.
It seemed a proper notion given that there is quite a gap between the second Test at Adelaide that supposedly ends on December 16 and the third Test at Melbourne that is scheduled to begin on December 26, continued…

New Zealand register innings win  level series 1-1By: Reuters | Sharjah |
Posted: November 30, 2014 6:48 pm | Updated: November 30, 2014 10:49 pm
Paceman Trent Boult took four wickets as New Zealand beat Pakistan by an innings and 80 runs to win the third and final Test within four days and level the series 1-1.
Pakistan, who won the first match of the series in Abu Dhabi by 248 runs, were all out for 259 in their second innings in Sharjah on Sunday.
Asad Shafiq staged a lone battle for Pakistan and completed his fifth Test hundred with an aggressive 137 off 148 balls but ran out of partners in the end.
On a docile pitch at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium where New Zealand posted their highest total in Tests, the 25-year-old Boult extracted enough movement and pace to rattle the Pakistan top order.
Shan Masood (4) edged Boult to Tim Southee at slip in the third over, while the paceman bowled Azhar Ali (6) with the last delivery of his fourth over and then returned to dismiss Younus Khan for a duck leg before with the first ball of his next.
Off-spinner Mark Craig, who took seven wickets in the first innings, continued to punish Pakistan by dismissing opener Mohammad Hafeez and captain Misbah-ul-Haq.
Hafeez (24) looked solid before he fell in the second over after lunch, offering a tame return catch to the 27-year-old Craig. Misbah (12) then reviewed the umpire’s bat-pad decision off the same bowler but failed to overturn it.
Sarfraz Ahmed (37) took the attack to the New Zealand bowlers and added a quickfire 73 for the sixth wicket with Shafiq.
But leg-spinner Ish Sodhi, who saw Sarfraz dropped twice off his bowling in one over, took out the wicketkeeper-batsman and Yasir Shah (10) to take New Zealand closer to victory.
The 28-year-old Shafiq smashed 18 fours and six sixes in his knock and added 78 for the ninth wicket with Rahat Ali to delay New Zealand’s celebration. He fell to Boult.
Rahat became the last man out and Craig’s 10th victim in the match.
Earlier in the morning, New Zealand’s first innings closed on 690 with Craig (65) becoming the sixth batsman to score at least a half-century in the innings.
The visitors hit 22 sixes in total, another record for the most number of maximums in a Test innings.
Paceman Rahat and leg-spinner Yasir Shah picked up four wickets each for Pakistan, while part-time off-spinner
Hafeez, who was reported for an illegal action after the first Test in Abu Dhabi, took the remaining two wickets.
Vettori delays retirement
New Zealand’s veteran spinner Daniel Vettori said he didn’t feel it appropriate to call time on his Test career after the tragic death of Phillip Hughes who was like a team-mate.
The 35-year-old staged a comeback in Test cricket after an injury gap of 28 months in the third and final Test in Sharjah, a match overshadowed by Hughes’s tragedy.
Vettori said he was unlikely to add to his record 112 caps for continued…

Consolidation Key for Indian Banking Industry Growth: Uday KotakMotherson Sumi's German Acquisition to Be EPS Accretive
Mumbai: Having sealed a mega deal to merge ING Vysya Bank with itself, Kotak Mahindra Bank's chief Uday Kotak has said consolidation is very important for growth of the domestic banking industry.
The banking industry is largely fragmented in India with 46 commercial banks, nearly half of which are state-run entities but only two of them figure among the world's 100 largest banks.
Besides, there have not been many mergers in the Indian banking space and the merger of ING Vysya Bank with Kotak Mahindra Bank is the first major deal since private sector leader ICICI Bank's takeover of Bank of Rajasthan about four years ago.
"Frankly speaking, consolidation is very important in Indian banking industry because to finance India's future financing needs, you need banks of size and this is one step towards that," Mr Kotak told PTI in an interview here.
The all-share transaction to merge ING Vysya Bank would create India's fourth largest private sector bank after ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Axis Bank, respectively. Incidentally, acquisitions have played a key role in growth of the two largest lenders.
"If you just look at our balance sheet on combined basis, it is Rs 2 lakh crore and the market cap will be over Rs 1 lakh crore," Mr Kotak said, while explaining the upside from the merger valued at over Rs 15,000 crore.
"If you look at the private sector, we will be the fourth largest and we see a significant upside. We are very well capitalised and we would not need any additional capital and therefore there is no plans to have any dilution in short to medium term. Our ability to grow is significant," he added.
Asked about the future growth prospects and whether the merged entity would be one of the global banks from India in next five years, he said, "The key thing and our internal mantra is bigger, bolder and better."
"So, we have to be bigger, we have to be bolder and we have to be better. Around this theme, we want to build a financial institution out of India which the country should be proud of."
"Size is important, but the quality of a financial institution in terms of what it does is also very important and this would include quality of our products, quality of our service and customers and that is much more important in my mind. Having said that, size is important to relevance too," Mr Kotak said.
On positioning of the merged entity, he said, "We are going to position ourselves as a world-class financial institution. We want to do things that are comparable to the best in the world. At the same time, we want to have a very strong human qualities. On combined basis, we would have 40,000 employees."
He expects the deal to get all necessary approvals by end of March 2015.

India Post Collects Rs 280 Cr via Cash on Delivery for E-Tailers: ReportMotherson Sumi's German Acquisition to Be EPS Accretive
New Delhi: Within a year of joining the e-commerce bandwagon as a distribution channel, India Post has transacted business worth Rs 280 crore in the cash on delivery (CoD) segment alone for firms like Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon.
While the amount of revenue generated for itself could not be ascertained, government officials said India Post is very keen on developing its e-commerce related services as a major revenue model going ahead.
"India Post collected over Rs 280 crore from consumers and gave it to e-commerce firms, since CoD facility was started in December 2013. The department with its huge network can serve as the best agency for not just delivering products, but also collecting money," a government official said.
However, this is a small chunk of the overall market size for e-commerce in India, which runs into billions of dollars already and is growing at a fast pace every year.
CoD has emerged as one of the most sought after services for e-commerce entities and 50-75 per cent of orders are placed with various online retailers with this payment option, while the remaining opt for credit card or bank payments.
In India, customers tend to prefer CoD as the online payment modes are yet to catch up in many parts of the country while many people are not comfortable with advance payments for products purchased online.
The government entity's cash handling services like core banking solutions, money transfer and a robust account system can further help e-commerce firms in collecting cash from users in urban as well as rural areas, the official said.
India Post has about 1.55 lakh post offices, making it the world's largest postal network. On an average, a post office serves 21.21 sq km area and about 7,175 people.
Another official said various e-commerce firms have been using India Posts CoD facility since it was introduced. Firms like Flipkart, Snapdeal, Amazon, Shopclues, Naaptol, Telebrands and Homeshop18 are some of them.
India Post has set up booking counters in the premises of some customers like Amazon and Naaptol, while for Snapdeal it is exploring setting up of e-commerce booking kiosks in post office locations.
Communications and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has also said previously that India Post is best suited to offer delivery services to e-commerce players, given its wide reach across rural, urban and semi-urban areas.
The minister has directed officials from the Department of Posts to focus on opportunities in e-commerce sector. India Post is also ramping up its infrastructure to grab a major chunk of the distribution, delivery or logistics, which will touch about $9 billion by 2021.
According to market experts, e-commerce business in India was about $6 billion in value in 2012 and is expected to touch $76 billion by 2021 of which distribution, delivery and logistics constitutes around 12 per cent.

Tata Power May Not Source Coal From Indonesia for Mundra
Press Trust of India | Updated On: November 30, 2014 20:29 (IST)
Motherson Sumi's German Acquisition to Be EPS Accretive
New Delhi: Tata Power may cut dependence on Indonesian coal and explore other geographies to source the fuel for expansion of its 4,000 MW Mundra ultra mega power project (UMPP) in Gujarat.
The company owns stake in KPC mining company in Indonesia, which owns and operates coal blocks in the island nation.
"It (import) could be from any market globally because after the HBA price regime was implemented in Indonesia, we get no advantage at all from ownership," Tata Power managing director Anil Sardana told PTI.
He said the coal for Mundra project expansion can be sourced from any other country and any other mine because one gets it at the market-determined price.
HBA price of Indonesia is the monthly coal reference rate which is calculated on the monthly average of four international coal indices.
"The expansion was on the assumption that the units will be linked to market phenomenon and we would be using imported coal," Mr Sardana said.
The company plans to expand the capacity of its Mundra project by 1,500 MW by adding two units.
As per the original plan layout prepared by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), there is space for two additional units.
"Since water is there, evacuation is there, every other facility is there and it makes sense for one to generate electricity at a cheaper price," Mr Sardana said.
Where else can one expect imported coal-based power being generated at less than Rs 3, he quipped.
On whether the company would go ahead with the proposed expansion of the Mundra despite little clarity on the issue of compensatory tariff, he said, "The compensatory tariff issue is only concerned with UMPP. As far as the two additional units are concerned, they will be at market prices, so therefore the two phases are completely different."
The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission earlier this year asked the power procurers to pay Rs 329.45 crore as compensatory tariff for the Mundra plant to partly offset escalation in the price of imported coal.

Mobile Commerce to Contribute up to 70% of Online Shopping: ExpertsMotherson Sumi's German Acquisition to Be EPS Accretive
Mumbai: Shopping online through smartphones is expected to be a game changer shortly and industry experts believe that mobile commerce or 'm-commerce' would contribute up to 70 per cent of their total revenues.
"In India, the mobile internet traffic now outweighs personal computer traffic. With increasing penetration of smartphones, India is all set to be a massive market for m-commerce. The marketing strategies for e-commerce companies will increasingly be tailored to suit the rising adoption of smartphones, social media and improving customer experience across touch points and platforms," Amazon India vice president and country manager Amit Agarwal told PTI.
He said that more than 40 per cent of their traffic comes from mobile devices.
Mobile internet users in India are estimated to be 120 million compared to 100 million users using internet on their personal computers.
"Close to 60 per cent of our orders are coming over mobile now. It is growing really fast. We get more traffic on the mobile than we get on personal computers. Within the next 12 months over 75 per cent of our orders will be on mobile," Snapdeal co-founder Kunal Bahl said.
Fashion portal retailer Myntra.com expects close to 70 per cent of revenue coming through mobiles this fiscal year.
"Myntra.com has witnessed phenomenal activity on the m-commerce front, with smartphones gaining prominence as the preferred mode to access and shop for fashion brands in the country."
"Currently, close to 50 per cent of our business is driven by m-commerce and with the launch of our Mobile App across all platforms (Android, iOS and Windows), we expect this figure to grow to 70 per cent by end of this fiscal," Myntra chief product and technology officer Shamik Sharma said.
M-commerce is estimated to be 30 per cent of the $3-billion e-tailing industry and is likely to grow to nearly 40 per cent of the industry that is expected to be 32 billion by 2020, according to Technopak senior vice president-retail and consumer products Ankur Bisen.
Flipkart senior director Marketing Mausam Bhatt said e-commerce industry is gradually progressing to be a m-commerce industry.
"I think the way e-commerce industry is evolving it is becoming more of a mobile-commerce industry. If you look at Flipkart a year ago, less than 10 per cent of our orders, transactions and visits used to come from mobile commerce."
"Now those numbers are greater than 50 per cent for us. It is accelerating at a very rapid pace. We are seeing more than 2 times or 3 times growth from the mobile front compared to desktop, where Flipkart is growing overall but mobile is growing at a much faster pace," he said.
For fashion portal Jabong, m-commerce constitutes 30 per cent of its sales, and founder and chief executive Arun Chandra Mohan said it will drive the growth of the sector.
"The internet penetration is increasing exponentially. The existing users are spending more time on internet. New users are increasing significantly. The mobile users are scaling up. So even in Jabong, we have invested heavily on mobile app."
"Close to 30 per cent of our revenues is coming from mobile. Penetration is increasing and existing users are coming back very strongly. M-commerce will drive the e-commerce growth going forward and right now it is a very strong enabler," he said.
Flipkart's Mr Bhatt said there is an increasing growth in commerce from the non-metro cities which is primarily driven through smartphones.
He pointed out that in India almost 70-75 per cent of the people primarily access internet via their phones, which is driving a lot of growth for a lot of companies.
"It enables them to expand their market outside of the traditional metro regions where a lot of e-commerce players are historically focused on and that is one of the big driving factors why e-commerce companies are now focusing on the mobile segment," he said.
He further said m-commerce story in India is proving to be a game changer at the global level.
"If you look at the benchmark from the US companies or the Chinese companies, the percentage of revenue that is driven from m-commerce in India is significantly higher than lot of those companies and countries," he said.
Myntra's Mr Sharma said mobile is an important mode to increase revenues and acquire customers.

Post-1962  China treated Gorkha POWs better  indoctrinated them: ResearchComments
After the Indian defeat in the war of 1962, China took in over 3,900 Indian Prisoners of War (POW). But among them, about 700 Gorkha POWs were singled out for different – ‘perhaps better’ – treatment, sought to be indoctrinated against their Indian officers, and told that Chinese and Nepalis are ‘brothers’. China even made a direct offer to Nepal to take back Gorkha POWs, an offer Kathmandu declined.
This was seen as a part of an effort to infiltrate Nepal with ‘agents’ – the fear of which alarmed the UK, whose diplomats in London, Kathmandu, Delhi and then Peking kept a close track of the episode. Chinese intentions also worried Nepal – but it kept those fears to itself because the royal regime wanted to portray to Delhi that it was closer to Beijing than it actually was.
These are claims made in a research article based on diplomatic correspondence between British diplomats (now available at the National Archives in London), and more recent press reports by a former British four-star general, Sir Sam Cowan. HT has exclusive access to the as-yet unpublished piece. While there have been earlier indications of differential treatment, the direct Chinese offer to Nepal as well as the high interest in London was not known so far.
On April 3, 1963, China announced its decision to release and repatriate all captured soldiers. The release process started the following week. In mid-May, there were press reports in Delhi that none of the Gorkha POWs had been released.
To figure the reason, Cowan quotes a cable by JAG Banks, the British High Commissioner in Delhi to his bosses in London earlier in April. The Nepal desk officer in the ministry of external affairs (MEA) had told Banks that China had been in touch with Nepal, ‘suggesting that as the Indian Gorkhas they had captured were Nepalese subjects, the Chinese government would be willing to release them directly to Nepal’. The Nepal government had replied saying it was ‘far from true that all Gorkhas lived in Nepal’ and rejected the offer. It was only on June 15 that PM Jawaharlal Nehru confirmed that Gorkha POWs had been returned to India.
On June 21, Guy Clark, the British ambassador to Nepal gave London an account of the treatment of a Gorkha POW based on a testimony provided by one such person at a British Gurkha depot. The dispatch quotes him to say they were ‘very well-treated’, were given a short pep talk each day on the ‘virtues of communism, told that Chinese and Nepalese were brothers, and that before long, India, Pakistan, Nepal and other small countries would become a part of communist China’. The ex prisoner had told the British that they had treated this as a ‘joke’ and did not intend to turn against their Indian officers.
Cowan however takes this with a pinch of salt and says, “We cannot be sure exactly how the Chinese treatment of Gorkhas POWs might have influenced their behavior, either immediately, or perhaps more particularly, many years later.” He throws up an intriguing possibility. The places which were the hub of Nepal’s radical left, and later communist movements, were also epicentres of Gorkha recruitment in the Indian Army. Did anyone influenced by his time in China help spread revolutionary consciousness in Nepal after retirement?
The then Nepal government was alive to these fears, with both the chairman of the council of ministers Tulsi Giri and police chief P S Lama, telling the British that they were well aware of Chinese plans to infiltrate agents. The Chinese military attaché had even sought to bribe Lama. But Nepal kept these fears to itself – for its entire approach with Delhi was to play up its warmth with Beijing to dilute Indian opposition to palace rule in Nepal.

Regional pact: India wants services  goods bundledTalks to form world’s largest trading bloc, including Asian giants, start today
New Delhi, November 30:  
India will face pressure from its partners to seal a separate deal in goods — leaving out services — as the next round of negotiations for a regional comprehensive economic partnership (RCEP) pact begins in New Delhi on Monday,
Separating services could take away India’s bargaining chip and prevent it from working out a good deal for its professionals, the Government fears. The RCEP, which will create the largest trading bloc in the world, includes India, the 10 Asean countries, Japan, South Korea, China, New Zealand and Australia. Together, they account for 45 per cent of the world population, and a quarter of global GDP, at $21.4 trillion.
“Almost all the partners want fast-tracking of an agreement in goods while pushing services to the backburner, but we are determined not to agree,” a Government official told BusinessLine.
Members are hoping to finalise the first set of offers (concessions) in the sixth round of talks in New Delhi, from December 1 to December 5. The negotiations are scheduled to be wrapped up by the end of next year.
Giving initial offers, supposed to be uniform for all members, is also proving to be a problem, as India is not comfortable with giving concessions to China.
“Several sectors have urged us to be cautious while offering concessions to China as they face intense competition from the country,” the official said.
Giving concessions to New Zealand and Australia similar to those offered to other partners is also not easy. “Except for China, New Zealand and Australia, we have free trade pacts with all RCEP members, which is turning out to be a problem,” he said.
This is because all FTA partner countries expect India to give initial offers equal to or over and above what exists in those pacts. It is difficult to give such liberal offers to countries that India does not have an FTA with.
New Delhi is adamant about not agreeing to separate agreements on goods and services because it has had a bitter experience with Asean. Since India agreed to sign a free trade agreement in goods early, it had nothing left to bargain with when it was negotiating on services.
As a result, it got almost nothing in the area of services, which happens to be of primary interest to the country.

Group Shows How Much Better World Would Be If Fortune 500 Donated Just 1% Of Revenuesreddit
One group wants more businesses digging deeper into their pockets for charitable causes, and it believes they'll make more money in the long run by doing so.
The One Hope Foundation , an organization working with companies to integrate charitable giving into their business models, believes companies that commit to worthy causes will boost bottom lines by complying with customers wants. The foundation's success causing positive change reflects a growing number of businesses prioritizing cause-related missions.
According to One Hope, if Fortune 500 companies donated just 1 percent of the $12.21 trillion they garnered in 2013, several milestones could have been reached with the funds: access to clean water for everyone who doesn't have it and an end to homelessness in the U.S., to name a couple.
Here's what else the world could do with 1 percent of $12.21 trillion:
As Time.com pointed out, " times have changed " from past decades, when businesses were skeptical to implement any form of social responsibility into their goals. Ten years ago, roughly a dozen Fortune 500 companies around the world issued a corporate social responsibility, or CSR, report -- today, the majority do .
The dramatic increase can be tied to a large number of consumers who want to support businesses that give back to charitable causes. A 2011 study by Cone Communications found that 94 percent of customers are likely to switch brands to one that supports a social issue, if the brands are about equal in price and quality.
The One Hope Foundation, which claims to have facilitated more than $1.5 million in donations to more than 200 charities thus far, is pushing for more business partners and soliciting donations from supporters in its latest campaign video above. The group says that a $10 donation to One Hope generates $500 to charity.

Indian Aces make it 3/3 in IPTLBy: Press Trust of India | Manila |
Posted: November 30, 2014 10:27 pm | Updated: November 30, 2014 10:45 pm
Indian Aces notched up their third win on the trot with a 28-20 victory over UAE Royals in the battle of two unbeaten sides in an India Premier Tennis League match.
After today’s win, Indian Aces topped the table after the Manila leg to emerge early front-runner in the high-profile tournament.
The Indian side, however, began with a loss with Ana Ivanovic going down fighting 4-6 in the Kristina Mladenovic in the first women’s singles. The battle of the in-form women’s singles players was a thrilling contest with Ivanovic almost making a sensational comeback from 1-5 down before eventually losing the match.
Experienced mixed doubles pair Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna registered a 6-3 second set win over Mladenovic and Nenad Zimonjic and Indian Aces took the advantage with Bopanna partnering the crowd favorite Gael Monfils to a 6-4 victory over Zimonjic and Marin Cilic in men’s doubles.
An injury pulled Cilic out from early in the set against Monfils, but Malek Jaziri was a more than capable substitute.
However, the creative Frenchman Monfils pulled off a 6-3 win to extend the Indian side’s lead.
The past champions’ singles was the main event worth waiting for, with big serves and entertaining shot-making from Goran Ivanisevic and Fabrice Santoro. Frenchman Santoro emerged 6-4 winner over Ivanisevic to complete the dominance by Indian Aces.
Monfils was later all praise for the kind of tennis being played in the tournament.
“I love this format. This suits me well. I love the team atmosphere. We have fun out there. Actually we’re good friends – Ana, Sania – we grew up together. It’s a good competition because we have fun,” he said. Monfils also commented on the use of a coach’s substitution.
“I was surprised with the substitution (of Cilic). Malek is tough but I think I was in great shape. I’m happy to win for my team. After three wins, I feel great, I feel strong.” Bopanna added, “We’re having a lot of fun and keeping each other motivated.”
Player coach Santoro said he enjoyed his time in Manila. “I will remember the hospitality and how many people love tennis here and are happy to see the best champions in the world and if you ask the crowd they’ll want to have this back again next year.”
In the second match of the day, home team Manila Mavericks withstood an inspired Serena Williams to beat Singapore Slammers 27-19 before adoring fans.
Mark Philippoussis was drafted in as a substitute due to Carlos Moya’s injury and he proved the right choice by entertaining the home crowd with brilliant tennis, taking the first set against Patrick Rafter 6-2.
Mavericks’ player-coach Treat Huey and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga whipped the audience into a frenzy in their 6-5 win over the in-form Singapore doubles pair of Nick Kyrgios and Tomas Berdych. Kyrgios was substituted mid-set for Lleyton Hewitt.
The crowd called out its admiration for a living legend of the sport as Serena Williams continued…

Two-time World Championship bronze medallist P.V. Sindhu lifted her first title of the season by successfully defending the $120,000 Macau Grand Prix Gold trophy after seeing off Kim Hyo Min of Korea in the women’s singles finals, in Macau on Sunday.
World No. 11 Sindhu prevailed over 91st-ranked, Kim 21-12 21-17 in the summit clash that lasted 45 minutes at the Tap Seac Multisport Pavilion in Macau.
The bronze-medallist at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games, Sindhu faced tough competition from Kim, who had come into the finals after beating seventh seed Chinese Yu Sun but the experienced Indian held her nerves to stave off the challenge from the Korean.
Kim started off on an aggressive note and found the gaps easily to lead 3-0. Sindhu slowly started to decode her rival’s game and not only clawed back at 6-6 with deceptive net play but led 7-6.
Kim wriggled her way out of difficult situation with the help of her back hand returns but she faced resistance from the experienced Sindhu, who used her smashes to notch up winners and entered the interval 11-8 up.
Sindhu dominated the long rallies after the break and caught Kim at the forecourt twice. She also earned points with her soft taps to rush to 19-9 when Kim failed to return a net shot.
The Korean earned a couple of winners with her cross court returns but Sindhu soon reached the game point after making Kim run to four corners of the court. The Indian then clinched the opening game in 20 minutes with a sharp return which Kim couldn’t negotiate.
After changing sides, Kim lost a few points hitting long and wide but her cross court slices helped her move neck and neck at 7-7.
Kim went into the lead when Sindhu made some misjudged at the baseline. The Indian also struggled with the length of her fast attacking lifts, allowing Kim to go into lead at 11-8.
Sindhu, however, got back her bearing after the breather as she drew parity and then went into a 13-11 lead with five straight points. Kim gathered two points to once again fight back to 13-13 but the Korean struggled with the drift and hit long and wide to be 13-17 behind.
Kim grabbed a point with two impressive forecourt returns and aided by Sindhu’s error in judgement at the baseline moved to 16-17. A long fierce rally ensued which Sindhu won after pushing the shuttle at the back of the court.
Sindhu earned a healthy four match-point lead when Kim failed to return a shot. Kim saved one when the Indian hit wide but with the Korean herself sending the shuttle out after that, Sindhu clinched her first title of the season.
Sindhu had lost the Syed Modi Grand Prix Gold final to fellow Indian Saina Nehwal in January this year.

Rail Vikas Nigam to hold 10% in new ports infra entityRail Vikas Nigam to hold 10% in new ports infra entity
Arijit Paladhi | New Delhi Dec 01, 2014 12:32 AM IST
Government-owned Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd (RVNL) is to take 10 per cent equity in the new public sector unit (PSU) to be formed to enhance port connectivity through the railways.
As already reported in this newspaper, all 12 major port trusts intend to jointly form the proposed company to be called Port Infrastructure Vikas Nigam Ltd (PIVNL). The PSU will be formed with equity stakes from all 12 major ports and RVNL, with a 90:10 shareholding pattern. The initial authorised share capital will be around Rs 100 crore, divided into a million equity shares of Rs 1,000 each.
The company will construct, operate and maintain rail and road infrastructure to facilitate connectivity for transportation of goods from ports in India or abroad. The special purpose vehicle is to be formed within a month of Cabinet approval. A draft note for the Cabinet was sent to, and been examined, by the ministries of finance, railways, law & justice and the Planning Commission.
RVNL is under the railways ministry. It was formed to undertake and implement railway projects. It has so far completed 11 port connectivity projects and has six pending. PIVNL has the specific objective of increasing the efficacy of the rail evacuation systems at major ports. End-to-end connectivity to the hinterland is an important factor in the efficiency and growth of a port. On that front, significant work remains to be done, a ministry official says.
In 2013-14, nearly 28 per cent of the total cargo handled by major ports was transported by Indian Railways, to and from the hinterland. A seven-year-old World Bank study says the optimal share of transporting goods through rail should be at least six percentage points higher. Non-major ports handle 60-90 per cent of their cargo volumes through the rail network.

Wary BJP pulls up socks to take on AAPs #MufflerManBJP pulls up socks to take on AAP’s #MufflerMan

The growing popularity of the Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) ‘MufflerMan’ on Twitter has made the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) jittery. The party is now desperately searching for ways to make its presence felt on the social media.
AAP’s social media campaign, ahead of the Delhi assembly elections, has been trending on Twitter with the hashtag ‘MufflerMan’ for many days now. According to sources, the state unit of the BJP has asked its members to focus more on Twitter by updating information and highlighting the work being carried out by the Modi government.
Also, for the first time, the party has asked the district units of the state BJP to come up with their own website to connect with local people. A senior BJP leader said that the Chandni Chowk district will launch its website on Tuesday.
“Hashtags including ‘Mufflerman’ and ‘Kejriwal Fir se’ have dominated the social media space for days now. Everyone is talking about it— whether or not they support AAP. Our presence on the social media is very poor and we are losing out on our youth support. A team is monitoring the work done by the social media so far and each district has been asked to create their own website,” said a senior BJP leader.
Sources said former AAP leader Ashwini Upadhyay, who is now the spokesperson for the Delhi BJP, is overseeing the entire process and has been tweeting regularly to counter claims made by the AAP.
“Workers have also been asked to trend topics relevant to the Delhi BJP to show the party’s presence on social networking sites. All councillors, former MLAs and party workers have been advised to use media tools, including Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp to reach out to the people. We need to reach out to the people in every way possible,” said a BJP leader.
“The AAP has been running a full-fledged campaign on social media wherein all the policies and decisions of the government are being debated and criticised. We need to respond by using the same platform,” said a senior BJP leader.

Another cricketing tragedy  21 years agoAnother cricketing tragedy, 21 years ago

When an emotional Australian team doctor, Peter Brukner, addressed the media in the aftermath of Phillip Hughes' death on Wednesday, he said the 25-year-old's injury was an "incredibly rare" vertebral artery dissection, which had been reported only 100 times and caused by a cricket ball just once.
An eerily similar case, perhaps the only other one caused by a cricket ball, from 21 years ago, is documented in a book of forensic case studies written by Melbourne-based journalist Liz Porter, The Sydney Morning Herald reported.
The other case is examined in Porter's book. The scene was not a first-class ground but a set of cricket nets in suburban Melbourne at a training session in 1993.
It received no media coverage that the forensic pathologist who reviewed the case, Dr David Ranson, can recall.
"Its circumstances make unbearable reading for any parent with children who play cricket - or baseball - or any sport involving sudden movement and a ball flying at some speed," Porter wrote.
The bowler, a regular in the third XI, was not bowling at a particularly brisk pace because he was nursing a knee injury.
He chatted to his mate between balls about their respective scores on the weekend. The bowler's mate then padded up and took his turn in the nets.
"The bowler took his usual short run, rolled his arm over and released the ball... It didn't land short enough to be a bouncer, and appeared to be heading to the leg side," Porter wrote.
"The bowler saw his mate positioning himself to hit the ball. But, suddenly, the ball hit some gravel on the matting and reared up - far higher than either of them expected.
"The bowler watched his friend move to evade it, scrunching his shoulder up and turning his head back sharply to the left, to avoid being hit as the ball bounced up," he said.
The batsman was given CPR at the scene, rushed to hospital and placed on life support.
"The following afternoon, the distraught bowler was told that his friend had died," Porter wrote.

Now  a dedicated air cargo service for NortheastNow, a dedicated air cargo service for Northeast
Supratim Dey | Guwahati Dec 01, 2014 12:39 AM IST
The landlocked Northeast region of the country is expected to get a dedicated air cargo service soon, to cater to the business community's needs for fast movement of goods to and fro. Mumbai-based Sovika Aviation Services said on Sunday it would launch a dedicated cargo airline service to cater to all major airports of the northeastern states from February 2015.
Speaking to Business Standard, Hemant Anand, vice-president of the company, said although there was huge movement of goods to and from the Northeast at present, there was no daily dedicated cargo airline service for the region. "Most likely by mid-February next year, we will be starting this cargo and freight service. We are very serious about this business and have done our homework well," said Anand. He was in the city to attend the North East Connectivity Summit, organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry.
The company plans to use an ATR-72 aircraft, which can carry eight tonnes of cargo, and fly to all major airports of the region such as Guwahati, Agartala, Imphal, Aizawl and Dimapur. Anand said since aviation engineering facilities are available in Kolkata, the service would be based out of here.
"I have visited several cities in the region in recent days to gauge the demand. The traders and businessmen I have spoken to are very enthusiastic on having a dedicated cargo airline service. We hope to carry at least 10 tonnes of cargo to and from the Northeast every day," he added. At present, cargo from the region is carried by passenger aircraft carry, which handle about 20 tonnes of cargo every day. Anand said quite often, traders are forced to delay the movement of their cargo due to unavailability of space in passenger aircraft.
He said he had spoken to the chief ministers of Assam and Meghalaya and have sought the state governments' support for the launch of the dedicated cargo airline service.
Speaking at the conference, Bhupesh Joshi, managing director, Clubone Air, said until and unless the state and central governments ease norms and licensing policies for the region, it would not be commercially viable for airlines to operate passenger aircraft on short routes in Northeast. At present, the region has 23 airports, among which 12 are non-operational.
"How long can we rely on subsidy route? The Airports Authority of India and the state and central governments need to sit with us on the table to understand our needs," said Joshi.

Ahead of Obama visit: India  US talks today on joint arms production  tech transferBarack Obama
(The aim of the dialogue is…)
NEW DELHI: India and the United States will discuss defence technology transfer and joint defence production in Delhi from Monday, in the first major political-military dialogue in the run-up to US President Barack Obama's visit to India as chief guest at Republic Day next month.
Hoping to give a boost to Modi's call to global manufacturers to 'Make in India', the two sides will explore the possibility of joint defence production in critical areas like missiles after the government allowed 49% FDI in this strategic sector.
The US delegation is being led by Indian-American Puneet Talwar, assistant secretary in the US State Department's bureau of political military affairs, officials told ET. An important agreement on defence collaboration is expected to be signed during Obama's trip, they added.
The aim of the dialogue is to have wider discussions on export licensing, defence cooperation and strategic cooperation, and this round will serve as a preparation for a possible defence pact during Obama's visit, officials indicated. The scope of the political-military dialogue was expanded during Modi's US trip in September.
A key element in discussions will be technology transfer that the Modi government is seeking for enabling India to attain self-sufficiency in the long run. The issue of technology transfer will be addressed under the Defence Trade and Technology Initiative or DTTI, which represents US' commitment to build an indigenous Indian industrial base by pre-screening projects for co-production, and eventually, co-development.
There are over 20 items ranging from anti-tank missiles to launch systems for aircraft carriers that the US has offered to India under DTTI. Officials said DTTI needs a fresh push from both sides.
The two countries will set up a task force to quickly evaluate and decide on unique projects and technologies which will have a transformative impact on bilateral defence relations and enhance India's defence industry and military capabilities, officials said.
With defence being one of the key areas of cooperation, the yardstick of long-term India-US cooperation will be FDI in India, transfer of technology, co-production and co-development, a diplomat said. India presents a huge opportunity for global defence equipment manufacturers as it has announced a procurement plan of $100 billion over the next decade.
There is consensus among American policymakers that maintaining stability in Asia requires increased security cooperation with a democracy and emerging economy like India, officials said.
The US defence industry is looking abroad to increase sales at a time when domestic budgets are declining.
The security relationship is one area that offers tremendous promise for India-US relations , an official said, adding that it is an important element of Modi's economic dream.

Will Narendra Modi Magic work: Cyclical recovery likelyTata Steel close to reopening its top iron ore mine
The rise of ‘strongman economics’…The spate of economic crises that unfolded – from the East Asian Crisis of 1997 to the Lehman Crisis of 2008 – dented the credentials of neo-liberal economics. Over the past decade, aggressive leaders or ‘strongmen’ in leading emerging economies (such as Putin in Russia, Erdogan in Turkey and Lula in Brazil) have sought to fill this ideological void with what we call ‘strongman economics’ i.e. ad-hoc economic policies alongside hyper-nationalism.
Narendra Modi’s rise to power and his key policy initiatives – the Prime Minister’s Jan Dhan Yojana,  Make in India campaign, and the Sanitation Mission – need to be viewed against this backdrop of hyper-nationalistic leaders implementing ad-hoc economic policies.
…rarely has a structural impact on the economy. Cross-country experience suggests ‘strongman economics’ has seldom resulted in the structure of the economy changing. The only common outcomes that each of these strongmen have delivered are lower inflation and higher GDP growth.
The former has been achieved by allowing central banks to focus on price stabilisation and the latter by adopting ad-hoc need-of-the-hour policies to revive growth. We expect the same dynamic to unfold in India.
India may be heading towards a cyclical recovery. India appears to be on the cusp of its ‘fourth wave’ of GDP growth, triggered by the change of guard in New Delhi as well as the policy reset. The new majority government looks likely to kick-start a cyclical recovery and it should be able to control inflation. Whilst Modi is focussed on propagating his pet schemes, the fact that India has a government with a simple majority should mean fewer decisions will be driven solely by political expediency and more  decisions should have a focus on economic efficiency. Modi’s likely focus on breaking down the self-perpetuating triangle of ‘corruption, competition and inflation’ should result in lower inflation.
Investment implications
The Mega-themes that will characterise Modi’s India are mostly the Mega-themes that have characterised the economy over the past five years i.e. (i) the rise of light industrial exports, (ii) the rise of aspirational consumption, and (iii) the decline of ‘connected’ companies. In a cyclical recovery, high-quality cyclical companies would perform well. Finally—and the market is ignoring this theme completely—as India moves into a lower inflation environment, the operating margins of entrenched players will come under pressure.
The rise of light industrial exports. Whilst China’s manufactured exports is 10x the size of India’s, China is losing its competitiveness, as India’s manufactured exports’ growth has exceeded China’s for the past five out of six years. The space vacated by China is likely to be distributed amongst various nations. Whilst India is capturing a share of China’s manufactured exports market too, which sub-sector is India likely to create a substantial mark in?
Given India’s rising expertise in the medium-technology space and its deficiencies on infrastructure and capital, India will likely enlarge its footing most decisively in the engineering goods space, which fortunately requires moderate amounts of capital, labour and technology.
India’s manufactured exports sector is growing at a healthy rate and it possesses formidable competitive advantages in cost and engineering talent. In particular, in light industrial manufacturing, sectors like auto & auto ancillaries, light capital goods, and chemicals seem to have a critical mass of relatively established companies with large export franchises. Here are 13 promising manufactured export plays from these sectors.
Stock-specific impact
Auto & auto ancillaries: Our export plays are Bajaj Auto, the poster boy of India manufactured exports; TVS Motors, our favourite turnaround story in the sector; Bharat Forge, the global leader in forgings; Balkrishna Industries, India’s largest tyre exporter; and WABCO, the well-managed Indian subsidiary of the global leader in brakes.
Light engineering: We focus here on a handful of companies which have built meaningful export franchises – Cummins India, the Indian subsidiary of the dominant American genset manufacturer; AIA Engineering, the #2 player globally in high-chrome grinding media; TTK Prestige, the largest manufacturer of pressure cookers globally; VA Tech, India’s leading water treatment project management company; Triveni Turbines, the leading manufacturer of small turbines (0-30MW); and Elgi Equipments, the second-largest domestic air compressor manufacturer.
Chemicals: We highlight the two most-appealing export plays in specialty chemicals – PI Industries, the best-positioned listed company in agrochemicals; and Aarti Industries, one of the leading suppliers of specialty chemicals to global manufacturers.
The sustained rise of aspirational consumption. The stellar rural wage inflation (10-year CAGR of 13%) has been responsible for the current rural prosperity. Besides the rise blue-collar wages and the number of rural roads and state/national highways are largely behind this step-up in demand.
Urban teledensity in India expanded from 48% in FY07 to 169% in FY12, implying a 4x increase. Rural teledensity has increased by 7x from 6% to 39%, led by Bihar, Bengal, MP and Maharashtra, which together account for nearly a third of rural population.
The continued fall of the connected company. Aidede by a series of landmark legal verdicts, the ‘connected company’ continues to fade away. Secondly, with Modi seemingly focused on maintaining his distance from the crony capitalist construct, the heyday of the connected company is behind us. Thirdly, it also appears that ‘connected companies’ that flourished during the UPA regime are having more regulatory/legal challenges than others. We reiterate that the share prices of such companies are headed towards zero. Since March 2011, our Good & Clean portfolios have beaten the BSE500 by 28% points.
Structural changes unlikely but cyclical recovery highly likely. Despite Modi’s claims of pursuing a mix of the ‘neo-liberal model of economic growth’ and the ‘East Asian growth model’, we believe Modi wouldn’t be able to change the trend path assumed by the various constituents of GDP over the past decades. But a cyclical recovery seems likely as the Centre improves business confidence through able governance.
Pressure on the margins of entrenched category leaders. In a high inflation environment, companies with strong brand names tend to be better placed than their newer, run-of-the-mill rivals, owing to their better pricing power. As a result, over the past decade, high and variable inflation has been a friend of strong companies and an enemy of weak companies. In effect, inflation takes profit from weak firms and gives it to stronger firms. If the core inflation starts coming off, we should be seeing corporates taking operating margin hits instead of hiking prices.

I have come to uproot Trinamool: Amit Shah on Mamata s home turfComments
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) launched a scathing attack on West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata on Sunday, laying the foundation for the 2016 assembly elections in the state where the saffron party is eyeing substantial gains.

Addressing a rally that saw a crowd of two lakh people, BJP national president Amit Shah attacked Banerjee over the Saradha case, terrorist activities as well as lack of development in the state.
"If you vote for a BJP government, we will ensure prosperity and take the state forward," Shah told the people of Bengal.
"A few days ago, Mamata Banerjee had asked: who is Amit Shah?  I am Amit Shah… I have come here to start the process of uprooting Trinamool Congress," he added, calling for a 'Trinamool-free Bengal', in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's slogan of a 'Congress-free India'.
Shah pointed out that throwing out the ruling party from the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) polls in 2015 can be the first step towards that “dream”.
The BJP chief's address came at a time when the ruling Trinamool Congress was reeling under graft allegations in the multi-crore Saradha chit fund scam and the October 2 blasts that killed two alleged militants from Bangladesh who had taken shelter in Burdwan.
"Stop protecting Bangladeshis," Shah told Banerjee, "Don't jeopardise the security of the state and the country."
Turning the heat on the state government over the blasts, he added, "Who is Hasan Chowdhury? Mamata Banerjee, please tell the people of Bengal who he is."
Chowdhury owned the two-storey house in Burdwan where a group of alleged Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh operatives were hiding. He is known to be a Trinamool worker.
Exuding confidence about BJP's poll prospects, Shah said, "Maharastra and Haryana have already voted for a BJP government. Jharkhand and J-K will certainly vote for BJP governments."
Shah added the Trinamool had failed to usher in development in Bengal, which is not known for an industry-friendly image.
"Many big industries have shut operations in West Bengal, the youth are unemployed and the... infrastructure is poor."
Reaching out to the youth, Shah said youngsters in Bengal wanted that the Burdwan terrorists be hanged and the Saradha culprits be sent behind the bars.
"I am challenging Mamata Banerjee to declare that those arrested by CBI in the Saradha scam are innocent," the BJP president added.
Trinamool MP Sinjoy Bose and suspended party MP Kunal Ghosh have been arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation in connection with the Saradha case that has sent a shock wave across the nation.
"Mamata Banerjee staged a big demonstration against the Singur factory (of Tata's Nano) that had affected about 1,200 people… But why is she silent about the Saradha scam that has affected 17 lakh people?"
The shadow of Saradha has been hounding Banerjee and her government since it exploded in early 2013. Kunal Ghosh had recently said Banerjee was the biggest beneficiary of the scam. 
"West Bengal needs a government that fights against corruption and does not protect people involved in scams," Shah said.
"The journey of Modiji's victory chariot flagged off in 2014 will come to Kolkata," he added at the rally, for which he was initially denied permission by the Trinamool government.
BJP state leaders had to move Calcutta high court thrice to obtain permission to organise it after the Kolkata Police, KMC and fire services department said no.
The BJP's rise in Bengal has sparked speculations about new equations in Bengal's political arena where the saffron brigade was a fringe player till recently.
However, banking on Modi's poll promises on development, the party bagged an impressive 16.8% vote share in the April-May Lok Sabha elections. Even though the BJP won just two of the 42 seats, it made an impact.
Frequent clashes between BJP and Trinamool supporters have been reported in Bengal since the polls.

OnePlus One launch in doubt after Cyanogen-Micromax dealOnePlus One launch in doubt after Cyanogen-Micromax deal
indiatoday.in        Last Updated: December 1, 2014  | 12:07 IST
OnePlus is supposed to launch its OnePlus One phone, a phone powered by CyanogenMod, in India on December 2. But after Cyanogen Inc announced an exclusive partnership with Micromax on Friday, there is seems to be some confusion around the launch.
Micromax and Cyanogen said that the CyanogenMod OS will be exclusively available to only Micromax phones in India.
The announcement has surprised OnePlus . Responding to a query on Twitter, the company co-founder Carl Pei said that the launch of the phone was still on schedule. "Our fans have done nothing wrong. We have done nothing wrong. India has waited long enough," he tweeted.
But it was not clear if the phone would run CyanogenMod or not. One thing is sure that even if the OnePlus One launches with CynaogenMod, it will probably not receive any CyanogenMod updates and in future will see its operating system, at least in India, getting replaced with some other software.
In a "letter" on the company website, Pei said that his firm was building new Android-based operating system for the OnePlus One.
Pei said that already a team is working on the new operating system. "(the) team was put in place originally to build the software which would power our future devices. So, though it's not what we originally planned, we have shifted engineering efforts to the OnePlus One upon hearing this news. According to our current estimations, we'll be able to release our first community build to our Indian users next month and have a production-ready build in February," he wrote.
"Our system will be based on Lollipop, and will be built to be stable, fast, and lightweight. True to our original promise of putting user experience first, it will be bloatware-free and only carry the features important to our users. We appreciate the work that Google has put into Android, and we have no plans of departing from Material Design nor adding unnecessary customizations," Pei added.

ET Wealth | Six ways that help you save taxSix ways to help you save tax next time you pay it
By ET Bureau | 1 Dec, 2014, 10.21AM IST
Faulty investment strategies and poor knowledge of rules could result in a higher tax outgo. Find out how to avoid it.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
Everybody complains about high taxes, but in the lowerand mid-income groups, the effective tax rate is not very high. A person with a taxable income of Rs 40,000 a month will pay only 3.2% of his income in tax.
Someone earning Rs 80,000 a month will pay 9.5%. This assumes that these taxpayers will invest at least 15% of their income in tax-saving options under Section 80C.
Yet, many taxpayers believe they are paying too much tax. They could be right. Faulty investment strategies, poor awareness about tax rules and tardiness could be exacting a high tax from some of the individuals.
One of the most common reasons for paying higher tax is the inability to avail of the full deduction under Section 80C. If you procrastinate tax planning and wake up at the end of February, there's a good chance that you won't be able to utilise the entire Rs 1.5 lakh tax-saving limit. "If you save regularly, you won't face any problem at the end of the financial year," advises Sudhir Kaushik, Cofounder and Chief Financial Officer of tax filing portal Taxspanner.com . Last year, Taxspanner noted that nearly 51% of the salaried taxpayers who used their portal to file tax returns had not fully exhausted the Rs 1 lakh saving limit under Section 80C. The figure might be higher next year because this year's budget has enhanced the saving limit to Rs 1.5 lakh.
This week's cover story looks at some of the most common reasons that taxpayers end up paying more tax. We also offer suggestions on how to avoid this higher outgo of tax by realigning investments and optimising the tax deductions that are available. If you are also following a faulty investment strategy or are not aware of the various rules that can help save tax , the nuggets of information in the following pages can prove invaluable for you.
Investing in tax-inefficient options
Fixed deposits are hot favourites of Indian investors. Nearly 56% of total household savings are parked in these deposits. But these are also very tax inefficient. The entire interest earned on the fixed deposit is taxed as income at the rate applicable to the investor. In the highest tax bracket, 30.9% tax pares the post-tax yield of these deposits significantly. Recurring deposits, infrastructure bonds and small saving schemes such as NSCs and the newly relaunched Kisan Vikas Patra get the same tax treatment.

Cant use religious places as dumping ground for arms: HCPosted: December 1, 2014 2:21 am
BY SANJEEV VERMA
Taking note of intelligence inputs that retired defence personnel were involved in training private commandos and arming them with illegal weapons to protect Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has decided to treat the issue as a public interest litigation.
The division bench comprising Justices M Jeyapaul and Darshan Singh has observed that search of such deras to unearth illegal arms and ammunition and monitoring the activities of deras on periodic basis is the need of the hour to avoid bloody confrontations like the recent operation on Sant Rampal’s Satlok Ashram in Barwala, Hisar.
“Religious places are meant only to impart religious discourses and not for giving training to private commandos to protect the head of a dera/ashram. At any rate, it cannot be used as a dumping ground of arms and ammunition,” the court observed.
Directing the high court registry to put the case before the Acting Chief Justice, the division bench said, “In view of the above facts and circumstances, the above observations made by us in connection with the Dera Sacha Sauda headed by Gurmeet Ram Rahim be taken as a public interest litigation.”
The judgment has come after senior advocate Anupam Gupta, amicus curiae in a criminal contempt case against Rampal, informed the court on November 28 that as per instructions issued by the Indian Army’s 10 Infantary Division Headquarters on December 13, 2010, some ex-servicemen were involved in imparting weapon training to activists of Dera Sacha Sauda. Intelligence inputs had also pointed to the involvement of some serving defence personnel in activities of the dera.
The court mentioned that unless illegal activities are monitored by top-level bureaucrats and police force, the situation would slip out of hand. Casualties will be more compared to what we faced while executing the arrest warrant against Rampal, it added.
The court also took judicial notice of the fact that Gurmeet Ram Rahim is facing two cases of murder and one case of rape being heard by a special CBI court.

Leftist Vazquez wins Uruguay presidential runoff: exitpollsBy: Associated Press | Montevideo |
Posted: December 1, 2014 9:51 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 11:39 am
Tabare Vazquez’s victory in Uruguay’s presidential election is a show of support for the leftist coalition that has governed the country for the past decade and allows the government to proceed with its plan to create the world’s first state-run marijuana marketplace.
Vazquez, a 74-year-old oncologist who was president from 2005 to 2010, topped center-right rival Luis Lacalle Pou of the National Party 53 percent to 40 percent in Sunday’s vote.
The runoff vote drew international attention after Lacalle Pou promised to undo much of the pioneering plan to put the government in charge of regulating the production, distribution and sale of marijuana on a nationwide scale. Vazquez, meanwhile, said he would proceed with it, unless it produced negative results.
As results came in, Lacalle Pou called Vazquez to concede and wish him “great success,” while supporters of Vazquez’s Broad Front coalition poured into the streets to celebrate.
In his victory speech, Vazquez called on the opposition to join him in a national accord to deal with the issues of public security, health and education. “I want to be able to count on all Uruguayans, but not so they follow me, so they guide me, accompany me.”
Sunday’s win marked a reversal of roles for Vazquez, who shook up Uruguayan politics when he became president the first time, peacefully ending 170 years of two-party dominance. In his first presidential campaign, Vazquez promised changes that would “shake the roots of the trees.” But he governed as a relatively cautious moderate, avoiding the constitutional changes and polarization that have shaken countries such as Venezuela.
His popularity on leaving office paved the way for the election of his successor, current President Jose Mujica, a former guerrilla known for his humble lifestyle and straight talk. Both men belong to the Broad Front coalition, which has been in power for a decade and has passed laws same-sex marriage, abortion and marijuana.
This time around, Mujica’s popularity and a strong economy helped propel Vazquez into office, where he is now seen as the candidate of continuity, not of change.
Javier Silva, an operator at a state electrical plant, said he voted for Vazquez because he thinks the country is doing well.
“The economy is rising. The country isn’t anything like it was 10 or 20 years ago, when it was in decline,” said the 35-year-old.
Monica Centurion, an official at a state hospital, said she voted for Lacalle Pou because of his pledge to improve public security, which “is the principal issue.”
Vazquez immediately moved to calm fears that he would introduce radical change in his second term.
“Within the Constitution and the law everything. Outside the Constitution and the law nothing,” he told party militants after his win was announced.
Lacalle Pou is the son of another ex-president, Luis Alberto Lacalle Herrera, who governed from 1990 to 1995.
During his campaign, he criticized the marijuana plan, saying he continued…

Starlet Gauahar Khan slapped during reality showshootBy: Entertainment Feature Service | New Delhi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 9:46 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 5:24 pm
The self appointed moral police does it yet again! Model – actor Gauahar Khan was slapped by one of the audience members while she was hosting the singing reality show ‘India’s Raw Star’ at Film City in suburban Goregaon, Mumbai.
Gauahar Khan was attacked and threatened by an audience member who said that, “being a Muslim woman, she should not have worn such a short dress”, Aarey Colony police said. The accused, identified as Mohammed Akil Mallick (24), slapped and touched her inappropriately during the break of the show, but was immediately overpowered by the security guards deployed there, following which the police were notified.
Gauahar was as expected appalled at the slap and demanded the accused to be ousted. After the incident, she even refused shooting for the rest of the show, but the makers of the show convinced her to continue. Have a look at her reaction at the slap:
Senior inspector at Aarey police station, Vilas Chavan, said that the accused was subsequently arrested and booked under IPC sections 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation). Mallick will be produced before the court tomorrow.

Barcelona edge out Valencia 1-0  closes gap ontopBy: Reuters | Madrid |
Posted: December 1, 2014 9:42 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 1:42 pm
Barcelona left it late to snatch a 1-0 win at Valencia on Sunday after Atletico Madrid’s 2-0 victory at home to Deportivo La Coruna was overshadowed by the death of a visiting fan hours before kickoff.
A 43-year-old Deportivo supporter had to be pulled out of the freezing Manzanares river near Atletico’s Calderon arena after dozens of rival fans, who police said belonged to radical “ultras” groups, battled in the streets.
The man, who was identified by Deportivo as Francisco Javier Romero Taboada, suffered cardiac arrest, hypothermia and head injuries and died shortly after 2 pm local time (1300 GMT) when he failed to respond to efforts to revive him in hospital.
“It’s disgusting, such scum have no place in football,” Atletico chief executive Miguel Angel Gil Marin said on the club’s website (www.clubatleticodemadrid.com).
“I just hope that they identify those responsible so they can’t repeat actions as regrettable as these,” he added, just one voice in widespread condemnation of the violence.
Barca and Valencia each had plenty of chances in a scrappy game at the Mestalla that was settled when Sergio Busquets pounced on a loose ball and smashed it high into the net in the fourth minute of added time.
The ugly side of La Liga was again on display when Lionel Messi, who had a quiet night after setting a La Liga scoring record last weekend, appeared to be struck on the head by a plastic bottle thrown from the crowd during the goal celebrations.
The Argentina captain did not look to have been hurt and gave the thumbs up as he left the pitch.
Barca’s victory trimmed the gap to Real Madrid back to two points after the leaders set a club record of 16 straight victories in all competitions when they won 2-1 at Malaga on Saturday.
Real have 33 points from 13 matches, with Barca on 31 and champions Atletico on 29 in third. Valencia dropped to fifth on 24 points, two behind Sevilla who thrashed visiting Andalusian rivals Granada 5-1.
Barca should have been ahead in the 14th minute when Valencia goalkeeper Diego Alves produced a superb save to deny Luis Suarez, who is yet to open his account in La Liga since his ban for biting expired at the end of October.
The Uruguay international, who joined from Liverpool in the close season, then had a goal wrongly ruled out for offside in the 69th minute.
Barca keeper Claudio Bravo was also on fine form and conjured brilliant stops against second-half efforts from Sofiane Feghouli and Alvaro Negredo.
“We are never satisfied with a draw and we pushed until the end,” Busquets said in an interview with Spanish television.
“The ball fell to me after Alves saved and I put everything into the shot,” added the Spain midfielder.

Actor and model Gauahar Khan was allegedly slapped by a 24-year-old youth who was in the audience of a singing show hosted by her at Film City, Goregaon (East), on Sunday. The Aarey Sub police have detained the suspect, Akil Malik. Police sources said the accused told them he disapproved of the actor wearing a short skirt.

According to the police, the incident took place during the final episode of India's Raw Star at studio number 9. “A preliminary probe has revealed that someone from the audience started teasing Khan to which she protested. An argument ensued between Gauahar and the man who was teasing her. Things turned ugly when the man suddenly slapped the actor,” an Aarey police officer said requesting anonymity.
India's Raw Star is an Indian singing competition series hosted by Khan and mentored by singer-rapper Yo Yo Honey Singh.
The brawl did not end there with one of the show’s finalists and one of the production men beating up the accused. Guards deployed at the venue intervened and caught the accused and handed him over to the police who later sent him for a medical examination.
A source from the show reveals, “There were over 2,500 people present at the venue with 250 bouncers. Yet a 24-year-old guy in the crowd teased Khan and got into an argument with her. While he was being escorted out of the place, he managed to go up on stage and slapped her.”
The source adds, “It was chaos after the security pulled the man away. Gauahar was shocked and was crying a lot. A stunned Gauahar didn’t understand what happened. Though the shooting was stopped, Gauahar took a break of an hour to gather her bearings and then reported back on stage to finish the leftover one hour shoot.”
“We will record Khan’s statement in detail and will register a case under section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 354 (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) of Indian Penal Code and will arrest the accused youth,” said Vilas Chavan, senior inspector of the Aarey Sub police station.

The gains followed removal of gold import curbs and the 80-20 scheme by the Reserve Bank on Friday evening.
The 80-20 scheme mandated authorised gold importers to ensure 20 per cent of any gold consignment they imported was exported before any more import. These authorised importers typically provide gold to jewellery companies and so, were seeking export proof before providing additional gold.
The two import curbs were introduced in August 2013 and had hit jewellery companies’ business in multiple ways. The premium (price difference between domestic and imported gold) rose sharply due to reduced supply, making gold sourcing an expensive and difficult task. Second, the curbs restricted these companies’ ability to buy gold on lease from banks. Thus, while their margins took a beating, interest costs surged. Third, as a result, companies slowed on their expansion plans. Fourth, the companies had to resort to the more expensive methods of hedging on international commodity exchanges. Both earnings and return ratios thus came under pressure.
However, with the removal of these curbs, gold premiums have already begun correcting (to an estimated $3-4 from $10-15 an ounce; these had risen to as much as $75). The companies are thus expected to gradually see a reduction in sourcing pressures. Jewellery companies’ volumes could also get a push, as they can now meet the rising demand in the ongoing wedding season. “Titan could increase the quantum of gold-on-lease post these measures. This would be a key positive, as gold-on-lease is a low cost and effective hedging tool and bolster Titan’s ability to expand without resorting to debt,” analysts at Motilal Oswal Securities wrote in a recent note.
Notably, Titan had resorted to debt to fund its expansion plan after implementation of the curbs last year. From being a net cash company (Rs 83 crore) as of March 2014, Titan reported net debt of Rs 730 crore on its balance sheet as of September.
PC Jewellers' borrowings also rose, by 4.3 times to Rs 10,034 crore in FY14 over FY13. TBZ's debt increased 34.3 per cent to Rs 563 crore in FY14 over FY13. Titan, PC Jewellers and TBZ's return on capital employed (RoCE) compressed by 2,220 basis points, 760 bps and 460 bps, to 14.9 per cent, 26.7 per cent and 37.2 per cent, respectively, in FY14 versus the previous year.
However, Titan being a leading player, able to import gold directly from the international market, was relatively less impacted by the sourcing curbs as compared to its peers.
Abneesh Roy of Edelweiss Securities says, “PC Jewellers had export revenues, while Titan and TBZ had negligible exports at the time of imposition of the curbs. Thus, PC Jewellers was able to manage better on that front.” The removal of curbs is positive for all jewellery entities, as the volatile gold premium will now be minimal or zero. This will aid their quarterly numbers and improve their cash flow and margins, adds Roy.
While the three stocks rallied on Monday, they're still eight to 22 per cent lower than their respective 52-week highs. Most analysts remain positive on the prospects of these companies and have Titan as their preferred pick, given its larger size and leadership position. Since Friday, nine analysts have issued a recommendation on the stock, says Bloomberg — seven have a 'buy' and two a ‘hold’ rating. Their average target price of Rs 436 indicates a potential upside of about 12 per cent.

Rupee falls to fresh nine-month low in early tradeForex update: Rupee recovers from over 9-month low, ends at 62.02 against US dollar

The rupee on Monday recovered from initial losses and edged marginally higher at 62.02 against the Greenback, snapping a two-day losing trend, on late dollar selling by exporters and some banks.
After opening weak, the rupee hit a fresh nine-month low of 62.25 against US currency as traders reacted to government easing curbs on gold imports and economic growth for second quarter coming at a tepid 5.3 per cent. However, the local unit erased the losses and closed marginally higher by one paisa.
At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market, the rupee commenced sharply lower at an intra-day low of 62.25 a dollar from Friday's close of 62.03 .
The mood was a bit cautious ahead of Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) monetary policy review .
"Over this week, we expect the pair to trade within a range of 61.60/80 and 62.30/40 levels on spot. RBI monetary policy and US November jobs report will be key data points," said Anindya Banerjee, Currency Analyst, Kotak Securities.
Later, the rupee rebounded on dollar selling by some banks and exporters and ended at an intra-day high of 62.02 against the American unit, up 0.02 per cent.
In the previous two sessions, the rupee had lost 19 paise.
The domestic currency had little help from the domestic stock market on Monday as the benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) index Sensex closed 134.37 points (or 0.47 per cent) lower.
There was support for the rupee from data released by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) that showed FPIs/FIIs infused US $396.24 million in the domestic market on Friday.
The dollar index, a gauge of six major global rivals, was down by 0.15 per cent. Oil prices fell to a five-year low and even gold rates fell as global investors were risk-averse.
Pramit Brahmbhatt, CEO, Veracity Group said, the trading range for the spot rupee is expected to be within 61.60 to 62.40.
In the forward market, premia closed steady to weak on stray receipts from exporters.
The benchmark six-month premium payable in May ended at its last Friday's closing level of 224-226 paise while forward contracts maturing in November, 2015, softened to 433.5-435.5 paise from 435-437 paise.
The RBI fixed the reference rate for dollar at 62.1377 and for the Euro at 77.3677.
The rupee fell back against the pound to 97.48 from Friday's close of 97.34 while it moved down further to 77.31 per euro from 77.29.
The domestic unit, however, improved further to 52.36 per 100 Japanese yen from 52.48 last Friday.

Fans should simply hold onto their tickets until further notice  says CricketAustraliaBy: Reuters | Sydney |
Posted: December 1, 2014 10:06 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 1:17 pm
Cricket Australia and the Indian board (BCCI) remain in discussions over the future of the first Test between the two countries that was supposed to have started on Thursday in Brisbane.
The Dec. 4-8 match at the Gabba was postponed indefinitely on Saturday, following the death last Thursday of Australia batsman Phillip Hughes.
Hughes died two days after he was struck in the head by a short-pitched delivery in a first class game at the Sydney Cricket Ground, with his death causing an outpouring of emotion, sympathy and support from inside and outside the cricketing world.
“We know that there are many people who have purchased tickets to the test match who will be wondering what happens next ,” Cricket Australia James Sutherland told the cricket.com.au website on Monday.
“Once the situation has been resolved, we will advise them as a priority. Fans should simply hold onto their tickets until further notice.”
Local media reported that a decision on the test was likely to be made later on Monday, with the India team expected to arrive in Brisbane to begin their preparations.
A two-day game against an Australian XI in Adelaide scheduled for last Friday and Saturday was cancelled following Hughes’s death.
The funeral for the left-hander, who would have turned 26 on Sunday, will be held in his hometown of Macksville in northern New South Wales on Wednesday, with the timing of that considered a major determinant in postponing the first Test.
The fate of the first Test, however, had been in the balance even before Hughes died of his horrific injury as many of the Australia team were among his closest friends and few expected them to be mentally ready for the game anyway.
TV rights make an incoming tour by the India test team by far the most lucrative in the world game so cancellation of the Brisbane match is unlikely.
There is precious little room for manoeuvre, however, with the second Test scheduled to take place in Adelaide from Dec. 12-16 with the third starting on Boxing Day (Dec. 26) in Melbourne and the fourth in Sydney running from Jan. 3-7.

Brent crude sinks to $68.31  below psycholog...CMC Markets
(Brent crude for January…)
SINGAPORE: Oil prices fell further in Asia today to new multi-year lows, continuing a steep selloff sparked by OPEC's decision to maintain crude output in an oversupplied market.
US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for January delivery dipped USD 1.55 in early Asian trading to USD 64.60, its lowest intraday level since July 2009.
Brent crude for January sank USD 1.84 to USD 68.31, below the psychologically important USD 70 level.
"Negative actions in the oil market are continuing today. Investors see crude as remaining vulnerable after last week's OPEC announcement," Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, told AFP.
"We have not yet seen any piece of news or development that could trigger a bottoming out phase in oil prices," he added.
The unabated price plunge comes after the 12-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) opted Thursday to maintain its collective output ceiling at 30 million barrels per day, where it has stood for three years.
OPEC refused to cut production despite a glut of supplies that has sent prices tumbling by more than a third since June, with analysts warning of further falls to come.
The news dragged WTI down USD 7.54 in New York on Friday, compared with the settlement price on Wednesday, to end at USD 66.15 a barrel. US floor trading was closed Thursday for a holiday.
Brent meanwhile had settled at USD 70.15 on Friday, down USD 2.43 from Thursday's close. It had earlier touched USD 67.90, its lowest intraday price since February 2010.

The world has finally reached "the beginning of the end" of the AIDS pandemic that has infected and killed millions in the past 30 years, according to a leading campaign group fighting HIV.
The number of people newly infected with HIV over the last year was lower than the number of HIV-positive people who joined those getting access to the medicines they need to take for life to keep AIDS at bay.
But in a report to mark World AIDS Day on Dec. 1, the ONE campaign, an advocacy group working to end poverty and preventable disease in Africa, warned that reaching this milestone did not mean the end of AIDS was around the corner.
"We've passed the tipping point in the AIDS fight at the global level, but not all countries are there yet, and the gains made can easily stall or unravel," said Erin Hohlfelder, ONE's director of global health policy.
The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS is spread via blood, semen and breast milk. There is no cure for the infection, but AIDS can be kept at bay for many years with cocktails of antiretroviral drugs.
United Nations data show that in 2013, 35 million people were living with HIV, 2.1 million people were newly infected with the virus and some 1.5 million people died of AIDS. By far the greatest part of the HIV/AIDS burden is in sub-Saharan Africa.
The AIDS pandemic began more than 30 years ago and has killed up to 40 million people worldwide.
The United Nations AIDS agency, UNAIDS, says that, by June 2014, some 13.6 million people globally had access to AIDS drugs, a dramatic improvement on the 5 million who were getting treatment in 2010.
"Despite the good news, we should not take a victory lap yet," said Hohlfelder.
She highlighted several threats to current progress, including a $3 billion shortfall in the funds needed each year to control HIV around the world.
"We want to see bold new funding from a more diversified base, including more from African domestic budgets," she said.
ONE also noted that HIV is increasingly concentrated among hard-to-reach populations such as injecting drug users, gay men and sex workers - groups who are often stigmatised and have trouble accessing treatment and prevention services.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has eased norms to fund low-cost housing by permitting banks to extend loans against long-term infrastructure bonds.
The RBI, however, barred lenders from providing loans against long-term infrastructure bonds issued by other banks.
"Further, such loans should be subject to a ceiling, say, Rs 10 lakh ($16,170) per borrower, and tenure of loan should be within the maturity period of the bonds," the central bank said in a circular.
In July, the RBI had allowed long-term bonds raised by banks for infrastructure lending to be exempted from mandatory reserve requirements.

Govt scraps 80:20 scheme on gold importsGovernment eases curbs on gold imports, scraps 80:20 scheme
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 28, 2014  | 21:06 IST

Easing the restrictions on gold imports, the government has done away with the '80:20' scheme, freeing incoming shipments of the precious metal from exports.
Under the 80:20 norms, 20 per cent of the imported gold had to be mandatorily exported before bringing in new lot.
"We believe the move will do away with the distortions and calm the market which was anticipating some curbs to restrict gold imports," an official said, adding this would help reduce imports.
Sources said the 80:20 scheme was "working" as gold imports had slowed, but the shipments surged after certain relaxations were given by then UPA government.
The 80:20 scheme was put in place in August 2013 to curb gold imports, considered a major cause for the widening current account deficit (CAD).
The outgoing government in May relaxed the norms and permitted six private sector trading firms to import the gold under the 80:20 scheme.
Initially under 80:20 scheme, only state-owned firms and banks were permitted to import.
The six private firms, which were given relaxation, accounted for 40 per cent of the total gold imports in April-September, sources said.
Gold imports jumped 280 per cent to $4.17 billion in October, trade data showed.
India imported 95,673 kg of gold in September, the highest level in the first six months of this financial year.
In August, the imports stood at 50,213 kg.
Imports of the precious metal in April, May, June and July were 43,207 kg, 52,612 kg, 77,681 kg and 45,269 kg respectively.

Street finally reopens four days after Ferguson riotsBy David Montgomery November 28 Follow @dmontyjr

Police reopened a half-mile section of West Florissant Avenue in the Ferguson, St. Loui s, area Friday afternoon for the first time since nearly a dozen businesses were torched there Monday night after the announcement of the grand jury’s decision in the killing of Michael Brown.
The section will close again at 5 p.m., then re-open at 7 a.m., and will continue on that schedule in the coming days until business owners can demolish and secure their burned-out properties, said Lt. Norman Campbell of the St. Louis County Police, who is in charge of policing in the small community of Dellwood, adjacent to Ferguson, where the re-opened section is located.
“I will rebuild,” vowed Juanita Morris, standing in front of the burnt shell of her Juanita’s R Fashions Boutique. “This was a place to meet, not only to shop. People who were hurting could tell their stories.”
For residents like Jeff Gordon, a university student getting a degree to become a drug counselor at age 52, the closure has been a huge inconvenience. Instead of his normal 20-minute walk from the Dellwood Mobil Mart to his house in Ferguson, he has had to take a one-hour detour.
“Four days is too long,” Gordon said.
Police said they had to keep the section closed for so long because they considered it a crime scene.
In the confusing municipal geography of this area, dotted with small suburban jurisdictions, West Florissant cuts through Ferguson, then Dellwood, then Ferguson again, without making a turn. Brown was killed on a street off West Florissant, in Ferguson.
However, to the frustration of Dellwood Mayor Reggie Jones, the whole strip is frequently referred to as Ferguson in news reports.
“We don’t want people to overlook the impact on Dellwood,” Jones said at a news conference in front of Juanita’s, just before the avenue reopened.
Dellwood lost 13 businesses to fire, and another five were looted, Jones said. That includes buildings burned in a separate part of Dellwood, and it does not count buildings burned in Ferguson. The toll in Dellwood was 10 percent of its business district, Jones said.
“We have employees who need money for the holidays,” said Phil Hurlbut, a local resident and owner of the Mobil Mart who employs 11. He reopened Friday for the first time since being looted – but not burned – Monday night. He said “tens of thousands of dollars” worth of liquor and cigarettes were stolen. “They mostly live paycheck to paycheck,” he said of his employees. “So when they can’t work it’s a hardship for them.”

Not only rate cut is a must, but makers of consumables should be made to pass on the benefits of lower cost (petroleum, interest et all). Only then can you have control over inflation. However we works sans simple economic thinking and hence do not expect any rate cut

Equity benchmarks ended at new record closing high on Friday, the first day of December series, following further fall in crude oil prices after the OPEC decided not to cut output. Hopes of rate cut or indication of rate cut by RBI in monetary policy held on December 2 also pushed market higher in trade today.
The 30-share BSE Sensex rallied as much as 383.5 points intraday to hit a life high of 28822.37, before closing at 28693.99, up 255.08 points or 0.90 percent compared to previous close.
The 50-share NSE Nifty crossed another milestone 8600-mark, hitting an all-time high of 8617 but some profit booking in late trade dragged the benchmark index from the day’s highest point. The index closed at 8588.25, up 94.05 points or 1.11 percent.
Experts see strong upmove in the market in December series. They see the next target at 8750 on the Nifty and 29000 on the Sensex before any major correction.
Vibhav Kapoor of IL&FS is bullish on the Indian market. He said that medium term base for the Nifty has moved up to 8,000 level.
Ambit Capital has introduced a Sensex target of 36000 and sees GDP growth at 6 percent by the end of FY16.
For the week, the Sensex and Nifty gained 1.3 percent each. CNX Midcap index rose 1.1 percent while BSE Small Cap index fell 0.5 percent.
On the global front, Brent crude on Thursday fell to USD 71.25 a barrel, the lowest level since July 2010 after the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) decided against cutting output, leaving the market with excess supply. It maintained its output target of 30 million barrels per day. January Brent crude oil futures fell 0.03 percent to USD 72.56 a barrel and WTI crude oil declined 6.46 percent to USD 68.93 a barrel, at 16 hours IST.
Asian markets closed higher with the Nikkei rising 1.23 percent and Hang Seng climbing 1.99 percent while European markets like France’s CAC, Germany’s DAX and Britain’s FTSE fell 0.4-0.7 percent, at 16 hours IST.
Back home, second quarter GDP will be announced in the evening today, which will be closely watched as economists expect a slowdown in growth rate.
In other macro economic data, India's fiscal deficit climbed to Rs 4.76 lakh crore during April-October period (or 89.6 percent of the FY15 Budget target of Rs 5.31 lakh crore), up from Rs 4.58 lakh crore in the year-ago period.
 
The Reserve Bank of India will announce its fifth bio-monthly monetary policy review on December 2.
Vibhav Kapoor said that the current trend of falling crude oil price open up possibility of an earlier than anticipated rate cut. He is hoping RBI governor Rajan to slash rates in the upcoming policy. “If rate cut is not announced on December 2nd, then the market could see a mild negative reaction,” he added.
Shares of Punjab National Bank, Bank of Baroda, State Bank of India, IndusInd Bank, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and HDFC Bank gained 1-7 percent on hopes of rate cut next week.
In the auto space, Tata Motors, Hero Motocorp, Mahindra and Mahindra and Maruti Suzuki climbed 2-3 percent.
Coal mining company Coal India was up 1.6 percent as the board of directors of the company approved project report of thermal power plant worth investment of Rs 11,363 crore in Sundargarh. Environment minister Prakash Javadekar told Network 18 that not a single project of the company is stuck due to environment ministry nod.
However, Cairn India fell 4.44 percent (on fall in crude oil prices that may eat refining margins of the company) followed by Sesa Sterlite with 3 percent loss. Jindal Steel, Bharti Airtel, ONGC, GAIL and Dr Reddy's Labs declined 0.4-0.9 percent.
Lower crude oil prices also positively impacted a basket of stocks today. Oil marketing companies like HPCL, BPCL and IOC rallied 4-9 percent. Paint and tyre stocks like Asian Paints and Apollo Tyres also surged 5 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively as they will operationally benefit from lower crude prices.
Shares in non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) also gained ground today after the Raghuram Rajan-led Reserve Bank of India (RBI) last evening issued final guidelines for allowing the set up of “payment banks” and “small finance banks” in the country. Shriram Transport Finance, Sundaram Finance, SREI Infra Finance, Manappuram Finance and Muthoot Finance surged 3-4 percent.
About 1499 shares advanced while 1521 shares declined on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

Noida engineer's Rs 900 crore empire falls
A team of around 100 officials conducted search operations at 20 buildings located in Noida, Ghaziabad and Delhi. The drive will continue for a few more days.

NEW DELHI: Engineer Yadav Singh’s corruption has been so massive that Income Tax officials are yet to drill out the full detail of his ill-gotten wealth even after twenty raids.
The Income Tax department on Friday raided his residence at Noida’s Sector 51 and found cash worth Rs 10 crore and diamond and gold jewellery of around 2 kg.
Singh, meanwhile, was shunted out of the post of Chief Project Engineer and will no longer be looking after the three authorities of Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway. A red-faced Uttar Pradesh government has shifted him to Noida’s CEO office till investigations against him are completed.
On Thursday, the department had found unaccounted assets at the residence and offices of Singh and also unearthed 40 fake companies running under his wife Kusumlata’s name. Sources in the department say Singh’s scam runs over Rs 900 crore.
A team of around 100 officials conducted search operations at 20 buildings located in Noida, Ghaziabad and Delhi. The drive will continue for a few more days.
“We have found evidence to prove that Singh has unaccounted assets. We have seized laptops and documents. We will reveal all details in a day or two," said Krishna Saini, Director (Investigation), Income Tax department, Uttar Pradesh.
The team also sealed 13 lockers on Friday that belonged to Singh and his associates. It also found that two firms—Mamta and Meenu creations—were involved in managing Singh’s unaccounted-for money.
Web of deceit
The probe team has discovered that Meenu Creation Private Ltd and McConn Infra Private Limited were involved not only in exporting garments but also in buying land at throwaway prices and selling them at prevailing market rates. Singh allegedly misused his power in these transactions.
Sources said Singh was being interrogated by an I-T team in Delhi. They have detained Anil Peshawari, his business partner, to interrogate him.
“We have found Singh has invested in 35 fake Kolkata-based companies. We are yet to substantiate how he has invested the money. Singh used to get 5% as commission on every contract that he awarded to a contractor,” said another official.
Officials said this looks like a clear case of black money and fraud.
Saini said that some officers of Noida Authority would also be grilled in this connection. “It is a survey and search operation in which over 130 I-T officials and an equal number of policemen have been deployed. We have also recovered documents of unnamed properties. We cannot give out more details because the probe is on,” Saini said.
Digging deep
Sources said Singh had shares in many real estate companies of Noida and Greater Noida and had a team of contractors who used to work for him.
Although it was out in the public domain since 2007 that Yadav Singh was a corrupt officer who was involved in flouting every land deal norm, the Mayawati government between 2007 and 2012 and the present Akhilesh Yadav government had allegedly favoured him.
Despite facing corruption charges, Mayawati had given him charge of all infrastructure works in Noida. Flouting all norms, he had entered an agreement with several companies for Rs 954-crore projects within eight days in December 2011. In many cases, the deals were sealed without issuance of any tender.
Singh was suspended by the Akhilesh Yadav government in June 2012 from the post of Chief Maintenance Engineer of Noida Authority on charges of corruption.
However, a few months later, he was made Chief Engineer (Second) of Noida. The SP government had also given him the charge of Chief Project Officer of Yamuna Expressway Authority. He was practically exercising the powers of a Chief Engineer at all these places.
Yadav Singh and his wife's case brings to mind tainted Madhya Pradesh’s IAS couple Arvind and Tinoo Joshi's example. In 2010, an I-T raid led to the initial recovery of Rs 3 crore in cash. Further investigations revealed the MP cadre bureaucrats were in possession of assets disproportionate to their known sources of income which ran into Rs 360 crore.

Premium on ATM use was wanted badly by banksStory
Free but limited
Premium on ATM use may have irked customers but banks, backed by the RBI, want it badly.
Anand Adhikari      Follow @anandadhikari    Edition: Dec 7, 2014
The premium on transactions in one's own bank's ATMs may have irked many customers but the central bank is all for it though banks may take a differing position. ICICI Bank, the country's largest private bank, till date does not charge its customers for transactions from its ATMs.
But the other three big banks - SBI, HDFC Bank and Axis Bank - are charging Rs 5 to Rs 20 per transaction from its customers for using its own ATMs after the first five free transactions in a month. The move is the outcome of the RBI guidelines in August that restricted own-bank ATM use by customers to five free transaction per month. It had also reduced the other-bank ATM use from five free transactions to three in six metros.
While many experts see this move as bizarre, the bankers feel otherwise. A banker on condition of anonymity said, "It costs the bank Rs 15 to Rs 20 on every transaction."
ATMs are gradually replacing branches
According to Himanshu Pujara, Managing Director of Euronet India that provides electronic payment and transaction processing services, another big issue is the Rs 15 inter-change fee paid by the banks whose ATM cards are used by customers in other- bank ATMs. The big banks with large ATM networks have been opposing attempts to lower the charge while the smaller banks with lesser ATMs have been at the receiving end as they end up paying more.
In April 2009, the RBI for the first time put a cap on the charges levied at Rs 20 per transaction after bankers started charging anything from Rs 5 to Rs 60 per cash withdrawal.
Some bankers say the latest move was precipitated by customers who do not use mobile or Internet banking for cheque book requests or balance enquiry.
"Customers also withdraw cash and pay utility bills. It can be paid easily through net banking," says a banker. Recently we introduced toll-free numbers for balance enquiry, cheque book request, to which customers are gradually migrating," says Nitin Chugh, Head (digital banking) at HDFC Bank. Even today, the debit/ATM card is mostly used to withdraw money though it can be used as a shopper's card. RBI data show debit card use at merchant outlets is less than five per cent in terms of value transacted.
The bankers have the full backing of the RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan on this issue. In a FICCI seminar recently Rajan had said, "There are no free lunches. The ATM transaction is free for you but not for the bank. It costs the bank Rs 75 to Rs 100 for those five transactions." Rajan had clarified that the RBI has only allowed banks to charge customers for ATM use but it is not binding on banks. "If you like your customers to use the ATMs for free, you can subsidise the transactions. What we have done is let large banks make better business decisions, reduce the hidden subsidy and make it more transparent," Rajan had said.
Definitely, the onus is on banks as to what they should do as there could be many hiccups too. "The banks should take additional care and deliver what they promise. For instance, customers sometimes have to run around due to transaction failures at the ATMs. Will the banks compensate?" asks Nirmala Desiken, Trustee of Consumer Association of India.
As competition grows, banks also have to woo customers one way or the other.

Police arrest 118 globally for flight ticket fraudEnforcement Directorate probing beneficiary of Rs 425 crore Indian Premier League facilitation fee
Police around the world have arrested 118 suspects in a global investigation into online fraud that targets the travel industry, a crime said to cost airlines $1 billion a year.
European Union police coordination agency Europol said the arrests were made during two days of coordinated action this week at more than 80 airports in 45 countries.
The investigation targeted criminal online services selling credit card details and fake plane tickets.
Europol Director Rob Wainwright said Friday that the investigation and arrests were the result of close cooperation between law enforcement agencies, the airline industry and credit card companies.
Wainwright said ”We are reaching new levels with our cooperation and aim to become an unbeatable alliance with aspirations to make cyberspace as crime free as possible for global citizens.”

Egypt: Thousands protest against the verdict of Mubarak  one killedBy: Press Trust of India | Cairo |
Posted: November 30, 2014 9:54 am | Updated: November 30, 2014 1:04 pm
At least one person was killed and nine others injured when police clashed with demonstrators who were protesting in Cairo to denounce an Egyptian court’s verdict to drop a murder charge against ousted president Hosni Mubarak .
Over 3,000 protesters took to the streets and gathered near Tahrir Square on Saturday evening, after Mubarak was acquitted of a murder charge by a court which found him not guilty in the killing of hundreds of unarmed protesters during the 2011 revolution that toppled the former strongman’s nearly three decades-long regime.
Health Ministry spokesperson Hossam Abdel-Ghaffar confirmed that one protester died while nine others sustained injuries. The protesters held country’s flag and chanted slogans against the verdict. Police closed Tahrir square to prevent protesters from entering and fired water cannons, teargas and birdshot to disperse the crowd, media outlets reported.
In a dramatic reversal of fortune, Judge Mahmud Kamel al-Rashidi on Saturday overturned the life sentence Mubarak received in June 2012, which means he will face no punishment for allegedly sanctioning the murder of 846 protesters during Egypt’s 2011 uprising or for allegedly profiting from the export of gas at below-market rates.

India Post pockets Rs 280 cr courtesy Flipkart  AmazonAmazon
(While the amount of revenue…)
NEW DELHI: Within a year of joining the e-commerce bandwagon as a distribution channel, government entity India Post has transacted business worth Rs 280 crore in the Cash-on-Delivery (CoD) segment alone for firms like Flipkart , Snapdeal and Amazon.
While the amount of revenue generated for itself could not be ascertained, government officials said India Post is very keen on developing its e-commerce related services as a major revenue model going ahead.
"India Post collected over Rs 280 crore from consumers and gave it to e-commerce firms, since CoD facility was started in December 2013. The department with its huge network can serve as the best agency for not just delivering products, but also collecting money," a government official said.
However, this is a small chunk of the overall market size for e-commerce in India, which runs into billions of dollars already and is growing at a fast pace every year.
CoD has emerged as one of the most sought after services for e-commerce entities and 50-75 per cent of orders are placed with various online retailers with this payment option, while the remaining opt for credit card or bank payments.
In India, customers tend to prefer CoD as the online payment modes are yet to catch up in many parts of the country while many people are not comfortable with advance payments for products purchased online.
India Post's cash handling services like core banking solutions, money transfer and a robust account system can further help e-commerce firms in collecting cash from users in urban as well as rural areas, the official said.
India Post has about 1.55 lakh post offices, making it the world's largest postal network. On an average, a post office serves 21.21 sq km area and about 7,175 people.
Another official said various e-commerce firms have been using India Posts CoD facility since it was introduced. Firms like Flipkart, Snapdeal, Amazon, Shopclues, Naaptol, Telebrands and Homeshop18 are some of them.
India Post has set up booking counters in the premises of some customers like Amazon and Naaptol, while for Snapdeal it is exploring setting up of e-commerce booking kiosks in post office locations.
Communications and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has also said previously that India Post is best suited to offer delivery services to e-commerce players, given its wide reach across rural, urban and semi-urban areas.
The Minister has directed officials from the Department of Posts to focus on opportunities in e-commerce sector.
India Post is also ramping up its infrastructure to grab a major chunk of the distribution, delivery or logistics, which will touch about $9 billion by 2021. According to market experts, e-commerce business in India was about $6 billion in value in 2012 and is expected to touch $76 billion by 2021 of which distribution, delivery and logistics constitutes around 12 per cent.

India Post takes up Rs 7 000 crore investment projectAlibaba
( E-commerce is now going…)
SILIGURI: E mail, social networking or instant chats. All these Internet based services might have taken blood out of India Post while transforming communication in the country from paper based 'Letters' to electron based 'Data.' But E-Commerce, based upon the same internet is now going to pump in fresh blood to India post's veins prompting it to go for Rs 7,000 crore worth connectivity augmentation project.
"The e-commerce battle is growing at fast pace throughout the country. And there lies our new opportunity," says Mr. John Samuel, member of Postal Services Board . India Post is taking up a connectivity revamping project worth Rs 7000 Crore to utilize this opportunity.
"Wide and fast growing coverage of Internet through computer and mobile phones are bringing more and more people from even remote corners to the doorsteps of E Commerce sites. But delivery of the items is an issue where India Post excel's with its 1.5 lakh establishments and time tested connectivity network," he said.
E Commerce giant Alibaba in China or Amazon in US largely depend on their respective Postal Service. It's true that the same can happen in India too. But, "We need to bring in some change in our own attitude at certain corners and modernize our connectivity, physical as well as electronic," accepted Mr. Samuel.
India Post is now taking up a new-age IT project, at an approximate cost of Rs. 4909 crores. In addition, another Rs 2000 crore is being spent to add up vehicles to its nationwide fleet to ensure 'delivery on time,' a must for the E Commerce organizations.

(India Post is re-inventing…)
NEW DELHI: India Post is re-inventing itself to cater to the burgeoning eCommerce services industry in the country by setting up data centres, arming the postman with hand-held devices and implementing softwares for facilities like cash on delivery (CoD).
The modernisation project is being supervised by an Inter Ministerial Steering Committee, which includes officials from Finance Ministry , Department of Electronics and Information Technology and other stakeholders, according to sources.
The aim is to cash in on the growing demand for delivery and logistics in the eCommerce space.
India Post, with its huge network and experience in handling mail and parcels, is the best agency to provide pan-India delivery service, sources said.
According to market analysts, India's e-tailing space is estimated to be worth over USD 6 billion with delivery and logistics comprising around 10-12 per cent.
India Post has about 1.55 lakh post offices, making it the world's largest postal network. On an average, a post office serves 21.21 sq km area and about 7,175 people.
The project is also looking at providing standard web- based integration system and an end-to-end tracking service for the eCommerce firms. This will also enable the Department to undertake large consignments of goods and services.
India Post will also provide hand-held devices to about 15,000 postmen and other hardware in mail offices, with procurement expected to be completed by December 2015.
These devices would enable connectivity in rural areas, they said.
"Besides, softwares are being created for real time delivery data updation, money remittance systems for Cash on Delivery (CoD)/electronic generation and settlement of bills and interface with tracking systems of Railways and Airlines for complete visibility," a source said.
India Post will also have multiple access channels like POS, portal, mobile site and call centre for information, complaint management and article booking.
"To roll out these services, the modernisation project has various initiatives to augment capacities like setting up of data and recovery centres, softwares for money remittances services, etc," the source added.
A primary data centre has already been operationalised in Mumbai and work is on for a data recovery centre (to be set up in Mysore by December this year).
"Besides, software solutions for mail operations, money remittances (CoD), retail business, inventory management, Finance & Accounts is being worked on and this is likely to be rolled out by December next year," sources said.
Communications and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had said India Post with its rural, urban and semi-urban reach was best-suited to offer delivery services to e-commerce players.
Already, the West Bengal circle of the Postal Department has approached various industrial bodies with a plan to create an online marketplace for local traders.

Fifth NSG commandos hub to come up in Gujarat

(NSG hub will come up on a 41-acre…)
NEW DELHI: Gujarat will be the new base for stationing the elite NSG counter-terror commandos with the government sanctioning a new hub in the state six years after similar centres were created in the country following the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.
The latest National Security Guard hub will come up on a 41-acre land in Randesan village near state capital Gandhinagar and will house special counter-terror and counter-hijack strike units of these 'black cat' commandos in the western flank of the country alongside a similar base in Mumbai.
The chosen land is at a distance of 14 km and about 25 minutes drive from Ahmedabad International airport which will enable NSG teams to quickly get air-borne in an emergency.
The Union Home Ministry , according to official records, accorded final sanctions in this regard in September after which the state government has been asked to complete formalities before infrastructure works can begin here to raise commandos barracks and training facilities.
The government had created the first four NSG hubs in Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and Hyderabad in 2009, months after the November 2008 Mumbai attacks where 10 Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists laid a violent siege of over 60 hours and killed 166 people.
The Gujarat NSG hub, sources said, is expected to activated by November next year and a squad of 240 commandos will be stationed for movement at a short notice.
"The hub will reinforce the strength of the existing Mumbai base and will undertake specific strikes as and when required," a senior officer said.
Locating NSG in all the four corners of the country is aimed at rushing in the commandos for any counter-terror and counter-hijack operation in the shortest possible time.
The response time taken by the 'black cat' commandos force for countering the Mumbai terror attacks in 2008 had come under criticism and therefore the government had decided to station the commandos at various locations so that crucial time was not lost in transit.
NSG was raised in 1984 as a federal contingency force to counter terrorist-sponsored activities.

How fake art competes with the great masters in IndiaHow counterfeits compete with the great masters in India's fledgling art market
By Suman Layak , ET Bureau | 30 Nov, 2014, 01.43AM IST
Do not be a lazy buyer Read and educate yourself. The signature of the artist is often easiest to forge. See if you can spot the trademarks of the artists work or identify his/her brushstrokes?
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
It can happen to the best. As it did to Vickram Sethi, art dealer, auctioneer and chairman of the Institute of Contemporary Art .
Circa 2008, Sethi is sitting in his office in South Mumbai's art district, Kala Ghoda. After carefully looking at a fullsized Husain painting, it dawns on Sethi that he is being duped. Only a few days ago he had paid an advance of Rs 1 lakh after seeing an image of the painting and an art dealer had transported it over from Delhi. After seeing it for real in his gallery, Sethi was 90% sure it was a fake.
What followed was dramatic. Sethi locked up his gallery and refused to pay the balance of Rs 70-80 lakh. He also refused to let the painting be taken out unless he got a refund of the advance. After a few hours the dealer relented.
At the time of the incident MF Husain, the celebrated painter, had already moved to Dubai. Sethi digs deep into his memory to recall why he rejected the painting. The legs and knees of the horses were not right and the shape of the mane was different from Husain's trademark style. A full sheet Husain today can easily cost between Rs 22 lakh and Rs 30 lakh and more (a 4x6 can touch Rs 90 lakh) and there's no upper limit. Taking the "fake" hostage was probably worth it.
Here's a more recent example of a brush with dodgy art. A young lady, recommended by a painter of repute, approached businessman Harsh Goenka with a Husain painting in mid-2014.
Goenka, chairman of RPG Enterprises and one of the biggest art collectors in India, liked the painting. But, on a hunch, he sent it to art dealer Dadiba Pundole, who has dealt with a lot of Husain's work. Pundole pointed out to Goenka that while Husain's English signature on the painting matched, his signature in Hindi was wrong.
Also, the arrows in a scene showing Bhisma Pitamah on his deathbed were pointing upwards, the wrong direction. Husain had done this Mahabharata scene in many of his paintings. Goenka adds: "Also it was too perfect. Husain is never too perfect in his arrangement."
The seller claimed she had no idea that it was a fake and Goenka sent her away with the painting. Not every art buyer is as fortunate. Many end up with duds.
For instance, art consultant Mallika Advani , formerly with international art auctioneer Christie's, talks about a friend who recently came to her with two paintings of celebrated painter FN Souza.
She needed money to tide over a distress. Advani was, however, shocked to find that both the paintings were obvious fakes.
Welcome to the quicksand called the fledgling Indian art market , barely 15 years old, and yet to build its institutions.

For the purposes of authentication, it is important to distinguish between types of artists
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
Nirmalya Kumar
The buzz around the question of fakes in Indian art can be deafening. But, it has real consequences as it slows down the trade in art and leaves collectors as victims. My own observation based on 20 years of collecting Indian art, especially Jamini Roy, is that there are more fake authenticators than fakes.
First, one must define "fake". With old masters like Canaletto or Titian, it was all about distinguishing the "hand" of the master from that of the assistants. With modern art, Marcel Duchamp pronounced, "it is artist choice, not hand, that determines a genuine work". His most famous creation was an upside down porcelain urinal Fountain, which claimed that art is anything that does not have functional value. Following this, anything signed by the artist is considered "genuine", because one is buying the mind of a modern artist, not his hand.
The development of art over centuries and the advent of the camera means that a great painter does not necessarily make for a great artist. It is about having a new, unique, big idea. As an artist once famously said: "After I come up with the idea, do I have to paint it too?" Consequently, most artists have a studio to help them execute works such as the famous Anish Kapoor sculpture in the Olympic Park London . Or, with Jamini Roy, his two assistants who filled the colour after the master had painted the primary lines.
India loves a good conspiracy theory, especially where money is involved. The art world is full of these. The result is mushrooming of art authenticators, particularly for what is unfortunately called the Old Bengal School. Only in India do you find authenticators who are experts in multiple artists. It has become a business. Once when purchasing an obviously fake Jamini, I asked for an authenticity certificate. One was duly produced from a respectable art historian for Rs 15,000! Overseas, you can only be accepted as expert on one artist. Any relative of an artist being considered an expert is a curiously Indian phenomenon.
Some Indian art observers have asked for a government panel to be set up for authenticating art. Unfortunately, this is not an answer to the problem. A Rembrandt Research Project was set up in 1968 to authenticate the great artist's works. The predictable happened. The number of "approved" Rembrandts has steadily dropped from around 700 in 1920s to 250. The result of "group think" in committees leads to genuine works being excluded as it is easier to say "no" than "yes". Members who reject more frequently are viewed as being more rigorous in their approach.
A few months ago, I saw this happen with a three-person panel set up to authenticate Tagore paintings. And, if a genuine painting in one style is rejected, then of course, the other paintings by the artist in the same style must also questioned. Not surprisingly, the Rembrandt Research Project has now been declared a failure.
Among Indian artists, probably Jamini Roy evokes the word "fake" most frequently by non-experts. It makes them seem knowledgeable about art. But one must ask a few questions:
Is there any documentation to say that the artist signed the assistant's work?
Is there a single case of an assistant complaining that the master passed his or her work off as his own?

Led by Christie s auction  success of 3 art events may signal revival for industryLed by Christie's auction, success of three art events may signal revival for industry

(MF Husain’s That obscure…)
The Indian art fraternity is waiting for three grand events that may signal a revival for the domestic market: Christie's second auction of Indian works scheduled for December 11 in Mumbai, the Kochi-Muziris Biennale 2014 from December 12 to March end, and the seventh edition of the India Art Fair that runs from January 29 to February 1 in the capital.
While the scale and model of each event is different - the auction is a transparent, upfront secondary market; the fair an open commercial stage, and the biennale a not-for-profit exhibition -- the three complement each other in the Indian art market.
"The success of all three would certainly signal the revival for the industry," says Neha Kirpal, founder director of India Art Fair. "The art market runs on sentiment, not logic." Kirpal sees a "distinct uplift in sentiment" because of a stable government in place and "India's positive projection on the world stage." She attributes the "redefining moment" to the current government, without naming it.
Christie's expectations are along similar lines, although the Londonbased auction house does not see any "strong connection" between political stability and buying sentiment.
Orphans by Ram Kumar
Globally, Christie's notched up record sales of £2.69 billion, up 12% for the half year ended June 30.
The strong collection at the first Christie's auction wasn't enough to lift the Indian market, which had remained subdued largely because 2014 was an election year, say a majority of art marketers and critics that ET spoke with. The world's largest art broker expects to build upon the 2013 India auction, when it shored up more than $15.4 million -- doubling its own estimates -- with the upcoming sale.
"Prices for great works have been robust," says Sonal Singh, head of department, South Asian Modern and Contemporary Art, at Christie's India office in Mumbai. "There is demand for great trophy works...It is the function of quality that has been the underlying factor of the success."
SH Raza's Suryodaya or sunrise emphasises the role of light.
  This time Christie's has put on the block works by leading names of India's modern art movement, from Tyeb Mehta, Vasudeo S Gaitonde and Francis Newton Souza to Rabindranath Tagore and Jamini Roy. An untitled piece by Mehta is expected to fetch between $1.38 million and $1.95 million (Rs 12 crore). An untitled work by Gaitonde is estimated to sell for more than $1 million, as is one of Souza's pieces.
"A pocket book belonging to Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore is among my favourite things in the sale," says Singh. The book was given by Tagore to a teacher at Santiniketan and is being offered by his descendants. "Tagore composed many of his major poems and songs in this book, including poems from the Sonar Tari (Golden Boat) series...We expect it to sell for Rs 40-60 lakh," says Singh.

Besides, there are 10 pieces donated by contemporary artists such as Subodh Gupta, Atul Dodiya and Bharti Kher, sold to benefit Delhibased Khoj International Artists' Association, a globally recognised artist residency programme.

A preview of the works is currently being held in New Delhi to attract greater participation in the auction. "I sincerely hope for a good show by Christie's because currently the market is deep in the throes," says Siddhartha Tagore, editor and publisher of Art & Deal magazine. "A strong collection at next month's auction will definitely work to lift sentiment." The next India Art Fair is also geared up with a similar hope and an impressive line-up.
"We have moved deeper and wider for the 2015 show," says fair director Kirpal. Standing beside artworks from international galleries will be domestic counterparts from tier-II cities such as Ahmedabad, Ludhiana and Trivandrum as well as from Bangladesh and Pakistan.
At the Kochi-Muziris Biennale, 94 artists from 30 countries will be participating in the event, spread across eight venues. The second edition of the biennale is curated by Mumbai-based Jitish Kallat and will include contemporary artists Anish Kapoor and Yoko Ono.
For too long, Indian artists have sought western approval and recognition, a trend that's now changing with the growth of the domestic art market. "Christie's success last year is a good example of that," says Kirpal. "And I am even more optimistic for this year's sale."

Govt firm on reforms despite Opposition roadblocksArun Jaitley
(Finance minister Arun Jaitley…)
Finance minister Arun Jaitley took The Economic Times Awards platform to warn the Opposition parties that no amount of obstacles could stop the Narendra Modi government's resolve to lift India's economic growth back to 8% and more, signalling that a joint session of Parliament would be called if needed.
The government, which has been busy fixing the basic administrative problems caused by years of policy paralysis, aims to make the goods and services tax a reality, push reforms in land acquisition, encourage manufacturing, private investment in mining minerals, and end the notorious tax regime that became a nightmare for businessmen. The subsidy for the rich may well become history while the poor may still be eligible for it.
"I am quite conscious of the fact that some people will try and obstruct, though the national mood is to the contrary,'' Jaitley said at The Economic Times Awards for Corporate Excellence on Saturday. "The obstructionists won't be able to sustain for too long. We are fairly determined to go ahead with each one of these measures.''
India is on the cusp of a multi-year bull run amid gloom and doom in global economies as the Modi government breathes new life into administration. The emergence of Modi with the strongest ever mandate in more than three decades and his firm approach to governance have ushered hopes of what Nomura Securities calls the 'goldilocks' days for the Indian economy.
The Indian rupee and the stock market, which were pummelled last year due to collapse of governance, are buoyant this year, with international investors pouring in more than $40 billion in equity and debt. The rupee, which was the worst performer last year, is the best performer among emerging market currencies this year despite a surging US dollar. Though the economy is growing slower than its best days, it expanded 5.3% in the September quarter, beating estimates of 5.1%.
"In order to reform India, you have to reform the Railways,'' said Jaitley. "Manufacturing remains a serious challenge. Just freedom on licensing or creation of corridors or even raising sector limits is not going to solve our problems.... Unless we can assure investors that manufacturing in India will be cost effective and competitive."
Although some have been critical that the government has not made a significant push on reforms, it has been putting in place a system for a better functioning of the government. The government has hastened the clearance of pending projects and is easing labour laws. It will bring in the Constitutional amendments bill on goods and services tax in the current session of the Parliament which could create a national market breaking state boundaries.

Industry awaits reforms burst from Modi governmentArun Jaitley
(About 400 corporate honchos…)
Anticipation of a burst of reforms by the Narendra Modi government was in focus as India's top business leaders gathered on Saturday to honour the achievements of their compatriots at The Economic Times Awards 2014 for Corporate Excellence .
Businesses made a pitch for better infrastructure and a more conducive policy environment while senior ministers touted the government's track record during the six months it has been in power. Finance minister Arun Jaitley suggested that he was reading from the same hymn sheet as industry and vowed determination and urgency. "We are all in a hurry. The PM works overtime. The ministers are forced to work overtime. People also want early results," Jaitley said.
The land acquisition law which was championed and cleared by the previous UPA government came in for particular attention from Jaitley who blamed "obsolete thinking" for that piece of legislation as well as entitlement schemes seen as stifling investment. "We want to get government discretion out of the process."
Defence minister Manohar Parrikar was also big on the theme of urgency. Plucked out of Goa, the IIT alumnus indicated that his patience with the defence production establishment is running thin. "Fighters we have been developing, but for how many years? We need to get airborne fast."
About 400 corporate honchos were present at the ceremony, among them Kumar Mangalam Birla of the Aditya Birla group, Rahul Bajaj, PRS Oberoi, ICICI Bank and Infosys chairman KV Kamath, Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group's Anil Ambani, N Chandrasekaran, CEO of Tata Consultancy Services, the winner of the Company of the Year award, Dilip Shanghvi of Sun Pharmaceuticals, the Business Leader of the Year, and Cipla's Yusuf Hamied, the winner of the award for lifetime achievement.
The awards, India's premier business accolade, reflected the rising prominence of new-economy enterprises and startups. Zomato, the online restaurant listing guide, which is valued at `4,000 crore and expanding rapidly in India and abroad, became the second winner of the Startup of the Year award after Bookmyshow in 2013. Dhiraj Rajaram, the founder of data analytics provider Mu Sigma, was Entrepreneur of the Year along with Chandra Shekhar Ghosh of microfinance company Bandhan.
At a panel discussion on the theme "Achhe Din: On track for 8% growth?" Bharti Airtel's Sunil Bharti Mittal complimented the government for its clarity of vision and ability to put in hard work, but observed that this can only be a beginning. "The trailer is fantastic. We are waiting for the big magnum opus movie," he remarked.
Power minister Piyush Goyal described the ordinance on coal reform as "only the first step," and estimated that the problems in the sector would be resolved in eight to nine months. Commerce and industry minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who is championing the government's signature Make in India initiative to promote local manufacturing, also counselled patience. "It is taking a bit of time to play out, but the response has been absolutely encouraging," she said.

ET Awards 2014: Key highlights of the panel discussionArun Jaitley
(The event saw 11 players…)
NEW DELHI: The ET Awards for Corporate Excellence saw top corporate honchos of India Inc like Sunil Mittal, YC Deveshwar and prominent ministers of the NDA government including Finance Minister Arun Jaitley , Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman engaged in constructive dialogue under a single roof.
The panel discussion chaired by Bodhisatva Ganguli saw the participation from key members of the Cabinet and other ministers, including Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. The topic of the panel was whether India is on the right track to attain 8% growth.
Jaitley strongly advocated the 49% cap on FDI in defence as a major policy move, the objective being capacity building. He also said that allocation of resources has been the top priority of the government, but more needs to be done. "There is an increasing need for far greater preparedness in this sector than there has been in the past," he said.
This was mirrored by the new Defence Minister, Manohar Parrikar, who felt that the Indian industry had a huge potential and that, he will try to make the vision of 'Make in India' a reality in this sector.
"We are trying to make 'Make in India' a reality in the defence sector," he said. "Hopefully, we will be pushing through a lot more reforms in this sector in the days to come," he added.
Power minister Piyush Goyal was also optimistic about the passage of the coal ordinance in the parliament and assured the panel of the PM's support in this sector. "Power sector is a priority for PM Modi. I also have the budgetary support from the Finance Minister, and thus, I'm hopeful of the passage of this ordinance in Parliament soon," he said.
Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis felt that Mumbai has not created infrastructure initiatives in 15 years and that is an issue that needs to be addressed. "If India has to grow 8%, Maharashtra has to grow above 10%. Infrastructure initiatives spoken about have not been implemented in full and that is an area that we need to work on."
He also felt that coastal roads is the key to decongesting Mumbai and speedier clearances in this regard are important. He also said that plans are on to expedite the New Mumbai Airport.
Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that technology is taking over a lot of things today. "The role of technology in this day and age cannot be ignored, particularly in the retail sector," she said. She also expressed hope that the Make in India initiative will start showing on ground.
Businessman and Diageo chief Ivan Menezes expressed hope and happiness on Modi government's moves in the last few months. "I am delighted to see the reforms agenda being talked about by the government," he said. "Ease of Business is key to India's progress and I hope the number of clearances comes down drastically."
Bharti chairman Sunil Mittal also shared a similar sentiment about the new government. "I feel blessed to have a government as truly committed to bringing about change as this," he said.
ITC Chairman Y C Deveshwar , however, felt that the government's initiatives could take time to materialize and meanwhile, it is important not to compromise on competitiveness, that had been the case in the past. "Focus on manufacturing competitiveness is the need of the hour. In addition to this, it is also important to ensure that investment takes root in the municipality and panchayat level," he said.
Flipkart chief Sachin Bansal felt that the sentiment about India has changed tremendously in the past few months and that, its growth rate has been promising, especially when pitted against other developing economies.
The event saw 11 players in the corporate landscape of India take home awards spanning 10 broad categories.

The travellers dilemma: sexism in India or racism in the Westtourism and leisure
India grows heavy and claustrophobic after a few years of being the independent, vocal woman. The strong mask I need to don to keep safe, it grows into fetters. Images build up of those free women in Europe. Enough money has built up in the savings account so I can afford a return ticket. West is not new to me. I went there to university.
I am already backpacking in North India. Mother puts together the visa papers for me. Certain things like visa documentation require stability, structure, a home address and bank access. Thankfully other things are still free, like taking a Himalayan walk.
Austria to me resembles a cake. Viennese buildings I could slice into pieces and swallow the sweet concrete. The colours of buildings are pink, yellow, blue, green. Not light enough to be pastels, not dark enough to make a statement. Just right to make cakes with. Everything is beautiful — the neat roads, the pretty pots of flowers in balconies, the wild flowers in the Alps. The Alps even. Take out the crazy heights of the Himalayan range, shoot all the wild animals, chase out all the people except a few and add flowers in replacement. There are the Alps for you. I should mention the difference in attitude of the people towards mountains. While us good Indians we visit spots of interest, sit down in a group, eat, dump plastic and head back home, the western approach is different.
But when they see a mountain, they take out one or two sticks and start to use their legs. They like to climb three or four mountains a day. Sometimes they hurl themselves down at breakneck speed from the mountain top: I think they call it ice-skating.
Overall I liked Austria. If I wanted to live in a rich country, be middle class and have a suburban house, I would pick Austria. But I doubt if Austria would pick me. Still I have some family there through my boyfriend. It is a soft beginning to a backpack trip.
“When you see it all, you tend to thank god for the typical Asian hospitality”
Italy, Denmark and Germany follow. Time goes by, two months and a half. I grow, I change. I became narrower in the sense of needing fewer items to feel that my bag is enough. Backpacker’s disciplining. I became wider in that places stopped to matter. I could go anywhere, come out of any place.
There were some low points in the trip. Something else came at other times that brought sweetness. Overall it was a great experience.
Two things stood out for me in terms of culture shock.
The doors were spectacularly unfamiliar. I like doors that you push or pull and they open. Here my knowledge stopped. The Germanic race, they specialised in doors. They liked doors to open in, out and at 20 degree angles. They liked doors to morph into windows.
To open without being touched, they put sensors somewhere around a door to detect movement. Well-hidden always; I presume for the reason of aesthetics. I remember I took to a little dance every time I saw a door.
It was not just the doors, it was also, for example, the coffee machines that confused me. It was a machine world. Before you decide I am the simpleton, I want to interrupt. I see a cultural difference. I see the Germanic people as a masculine race, machine-oriented, intellectual, direct, on time. I see Indians as a feminine mind — family, care, incessant talk and natural design.
Another unexpected experience was the prevalence of racial judgments. Yes, in a street of light-skinned people to be the brown person in travel-rags is to stand out. What I did not anticipate was the extent of fear or hatred I felt at times. Especially when I was asking for a service in a shop. Once I had the experience of being denied entry to sit in the restaurant car of a train. I was told to go for a takeaway. It could have been a communication problem between Indian and European English. However, the incident stank so much of racist discrimination that I returned to the restaurant car and took time to lose my temper.
Being an Indian, I expect strict obsequiousness in people who provide me services. Jokes aside, thank god for the typical Asian hospitality. We don’t seem to mind so much the hierarchy of putting the customer first. I think any person behind the counter in shops in Europe has to be first apologised to and then approached carefully to find out the price of a pair of shoes. These incidents around race were so pervasive as I backpacked along the hinterlands of the continent that I was forced to the conclusion of having this choice: should I choose sexism in India or racism in the West?

Girls better than boys at making computer games: Study40
2
London: Girls are more adept at making story-based computer games than their male counterparts, a new study has found.
Researchers at the University of Sussex in UK asked pupils at a secondary school to design and programme their own computer game using a new visual programming language that shows pupils the computer programmes they have written in plain English.
Dr Kate Howland and Dr Judith Good found that girls in the classroom wrote more complex programmes in their games than the boys and also learnt more about coding compared to the boys.
A new study suggests that girls can be motivated to explore programming and create rich gameplay experiences by building on their skills in literacy and storytelling.
#computer games #computer programmes #video games
There are persistent concerns about the under representation of women in computing - only 17 per cent of the UK's computer science graduates in 2012 were female, despite a promising reduction of the gender gap in maths-related subjects at school level, researchers said.
Some believe that girls are put off in their teenage years by the common portrayal of the 'nerdy boy' in TV and film.
This new study suggests that girls can be motivated to explore programming and create rich gameplay experiences by building on their skills in literacy and storytelling.
"Given that girls' attainment in literacy is higher than boys across all stages of the primary and secondary school curriculum, it may be that explicitly tying programming to an activity that they tend to do well in leads to a commensurate gain in their programming skills," Good said.
"In other words, if girls' stories are typically more complex and well developed, then when creating stories in games, their stories will also require more sophisticated programs in order for their games to work," Good added.
The young people, aged 12-13, spent eight weeks developing their own 3D, role-playing games, using software made available with the popular medieval fantasy game Neverwinter Nights 2, which is based on the popular Dungeons & Dragons franchise.
Games like these are built on 'scripts', simple programmes that describe what happens if or when a particular condition is met - eg if the player kills the dragon, a message is displayed on screen.
However, many young people with no prior programming experience are daunted by the complexity of the coding languages used to build these scripts. Howland and Good developed a new programming language called Flip that 'scaffolds' pupils as they script events within their game. It uses a simple interface in which users create scripts by connecting graphical blocks together.
The girls used seven different triggers - almost twice as many as the boys - and were much more successful at creating complex scripts with two or more parts and conditional clauses.
Boys nearly always chose to trigger their scripts on when a character says something, which is the first and easiest trigger to learn.
The study was published in the journal Computers and Education.

PF Body to Become UIDAI Registrar to Enroll Subscribers
Press Trust of India | Updated On: November 30, 2014 21:14 (IST)
Your ATM Usage Pattern Need Not Hurt Your Pocket
New Delhi: The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has decided to become a registrar of the Unique Identification Authority of India to facilitate enrolment of its subscribers who don't have Aadhaar.
The retirement fund body wants to seed over 4.2 crore portable Universal PF Account Numbers issued by it, with the Aadhaar number of subscribers.
In order to deliberate upon the strategy to seed more Aadhaar numbers in UAN database, a meeting was held between EPFO and UIDAI in the presence of UIDAI's director general and mission director, Vijay S Madan, and EPFO's Central Provident Fund Commissioner, K K Jalan.
"During the meeting, it was decided that EPFO should sign up as registrar to enrol EPF members, who do not have an Aadhaar number to facilitate the enrolment process for such members," an office circular said.
It was noted during the meeting that under UAN programme, the seeding of Aadhaar number in the UAN database is very low.
At present, for 4.2 crore UANs issued by EPFO, only around 42 lakh Aadhaar numbers of members have been uploaded and about 21 lakh Aadhaar numbers of members have been digitally verified by the employers.
It was also decided that till the process for EPFO to become Registrar and engagement of Enrolment agencies is completed, the field offices of UIDAI would facilitate setting up of enrolment camps at all the offices of EPFO coming under their jurisdiction immediately.
The availability of an enrolment camp at each of its field office would facilitate the EPF members to enroll conveniently at these camps, as per the circular. EPFO has planned to launch a facility of submitting online application for settlement of PF withdrawal claims next month.
The facility, however, would be available to all those members whose PF account is seeded with Aadhaar number as biometric details would help to facilitate the big financial transactions.

Mamata shielding blast accused: Shahnational politics
West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is trying to shield the accused in the Bardhaman blast case, Bharatiya Janata Party president Amit Shah said here on Sunday.
Addressing an Utthan Diwas (Day of Rising) function of the party, he accused Ms. Banerjee of “toying with national security” for the sake of vote-bank and trying to block the National Investigation Agency (NIA) investigation into the case by raising questions of federalism.
The Trinamool Congress rubbished Mr. Shah’s allegation.
The BJP leader said many Trinamool leaders were involved in the case. “Who is Ms. Banerjee trying to shield? She has to tell the people of Bengal who is Nurul Hassan Chowdhury [known to be a Trinamool supporter at Khagragarh in Bardhaman] in whose house the blast took place,” Mr. Shah said.
Mr. Shah cautioned Ms. Banerjee against “depending on Bangladeshi infiltrators” to save her partyHe also alleged that Ms. Banerjee had tried to stall the NIA probe by raising the issue of federalism.
Making it clear that coming to power in West Bengal in the 2016 Assembly election was a priority for the BJP, Mr. Shah urged the people of West Bengal to “uproot” the Trinamool in the Kolkata Municipal Corporation election early next year.

Putting a human face on historyWritten by A O Scott |
Posted: December 1, 2014 12:54 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 8:45 am
Ever since the financial crisis of 2008, I’ve been waiting for The Grapes of Wrath. Or maybe A Raisin in the Sun, or Death of a Salesman, a Zola novel or a Woody Guthrie ballad — something that would sum up the injustices and worries of the times, and put a human face on the impersonal movements of history. The originals are all still around, available for revival and rediscovery and part of a robust artistic record of hard times past. But we are in the midst of hard times now, and it feels as if art is failing us.
For the past few years, like a lot of other people, I’ve been preoccupied by the economic state of the world. I spend more time than is healthy pondering the global labour market, the minimum wage, rising inequality, the collapse of the middle class, Thomas Piketty, Janet Yellen and the gross domestic product in China, India and Brazil. Closer to home, I’m grateful for my luck and worried about my neighbours, anxious about my children’s prospects and troubled by the fissures that divide my city and my country.
Strictly speaking, none of this has much to do with my designated area of professional expertise, which could reasonably be defined as writing about the stuff that people seek out to escape such worries and anxieties. Serious art and popular entertainment, in their diverse ways, offer refuge and distraction. Their pleasures and comforts are not trivial, but essential. Art is the domain of solved problems, even if the problems are formal and the solutions artificial.
But if art, ideally, floats free of the grim reality of work, need and sustenance, that reality is nonetheless its raw material and its context. Intentionally or not, artists in every form and style draw on and refashion the facts of life that surround them, and the resulting work takes its place among those facts. What I’m grandly and abstractly calling “works of art” are more concretely and prosaically books, songs, movies, plays, TV series, environmental installations, paintings, operas and anything else that falls into the bin of consumer goods marked “Culture”. These goods are bought and sold, whether as physical objects, ephemeral real-time experiences or digital artifacts. Their making requires labour, capital and a market for distribution. The money might come from foundations, Kickstarter campaigns or retail sales or advertising revenue. The commerce between artist and public is brokered by the traditional culture industry and also by disruptive upstarts like Amazon, Netflix, Google and iTunes. But the whole system, from top to bottom, from the Metropolitan Opera House to the busker in the subway station below it, is inescapably part of the capitalist economy.
And that economy, in turn, provides an endless stream of subject matter. Much as I respect the efforts of economists and social scientists to explain the world and the intermittent efforts of politicians to change it, I trust artists and writers more. Not necessarily to be righteous or infallible, or even consistent or coherent; not to continued…

GST still not in place  states dismantle VATTata Steel close to reopening its top iron ore mine
Even before a debate began on how exclusion of petroleum products and a high revenue neutral rate (RNR) among other regressive proposals could sully the image of the proposed Goods and Services Tax (GST), several major states had already impaired the structure of its precursor, the Value Added Tax. While experts vouch for the principles that must guide the GST/VAT design, namely levy at every transaction of businesses above a threshold and input tax credit for every buyer except the final consumer, these state governments have over the past few years violated them, almost recklessly.
The state VAT launched about a decade ago has been deprived of its ability to produce incremental economic growth. The states’ policies that run contrary to the tenets of the VAT system began as they hiked tax rates by a quarter post-2009 when the Centre was still to withdraw a fiscal stimulus.
The stimulus was meant to prevent a drastic fall in growth on the heels of the global economic crisis.
In the more recent years, some states, in their anxiety to protect revenue growth despite a prolonged economic slowdown, have also imposed a disguised tax on inter-state stock transfers and truncated the input tax credit (ITC) by various means.
At least one of these states has even restricted the levy to the easy-to-capture first point of sale in case of a number of items of great currency, negating the concepts of multi-point taxation and a wider tax base.
Instances of states’ VAT-distorting policies are many. Punjab, in December 2013, introduced a  system of levy only on the first point of sale for a large variety of items – from electronic goods and packaged foods to mineral water and medicines – at substantially higher rates of 7-25% (as against the weighted average of about 12% in case of other items). This meant the tax is paid at either the manufacturer’s or first importer’s stage and an absence of tax on the value added downstream, including at wholesale and retail points. The logic was simple: levy the tax where it is easy to do and protect immediate revenue streams by raising the rates; avoid the pain of keeping a trail on the value chain if the value addition to be captured is relatively small (20-25% in this case). As a result, the VAT system in the state had collapsed.
Also, some states have amended rules on tax credits that punish large companies having outfits in different parts of the country and have to transfer part of their stock across state borders before they are sold. In theory, there is no tax on moving products within a group company across borders as this does not amount to sale. However, thanks to the change in Tamil Nadu’s VAT rules in November 2013, a taxpayer in that state says a car manufacturer, cannot fully utilise the tax credit on the raw materials purchased within the state to meet the VAT liability on the cars sold in the state, because a part of those raw materials are used to manufacture cars moved to neighbouring Karnataka.
The restrictive rule by Tamil Nadu is that in such cases (here the sale of cars within Tamil Nadu), input tax credit shall be allowed only if the tax paid on inputs sourced within the state is more than 5% of their value. In most cases, this is not the case and the ITC gets denied. This goes against the ITC’s rationale that a buyer, if not a final consumer, should not pay a tax on the tax content of his input price.
Although this amounts to a virtual tax on stock transfers from a state, itself a bad impost given that it seeks to undermine the freedom of firms to conduct their businesses in the most economical way, an unintended victim is the consumer in the same state, as truncated input tax credits for the manufacturer/dealer could inflate consumer price.
Tamil Nadu also restricts input tax credit for dealers unable to claim the concessional 2% Central Sales Tax (CST) on inter-state sales, and is therefore liable to pay VAT even on items exported to other states. CST being an origin based tax is the right of the exporting states and no credit is available on this.
Some states either do not allow or severely restrict input tax credit when petroleum refineries sell their outputs. In September 2014, Gujarat restricted credit on input tax incurred on purchase of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products. Maharashtra also does not allow petroleum refiners like BPCL and IOC to use ITC from crude purchases, for instance from ONGC’s Bombay High fields, to pay output taxes.
The economic cost of these distortions are considerable. Rahul Renavikar, executive director at EY, says there is a growing tendency amongst key states to tweak the VAT system. For businesses with pan-India operations, this is a big irritant, he adds. Also, most states try to milch petroleum products to augment revenue, again an unwholesome practice. For instance, revenues from petroleum, oil and lubricants, or POL, accounted for 30% of Gujarat’s revenue from tax on sales in FY14, up from 27% in FY11; in Maharashtra’s case, POL’s share rose to 33% from 28% in the same period. Over 60% of the states’ own tax revenue comes from sales tax (VAT).
While most states have more or less managed to keep the revenue growth in the post-crisis period similar to the preexisted levels due to these misadventures and a help from sustained high inflation (VAT is ad valorem), experts warn that the states’ purblind tax policies could now start backfiring. These policies, they say, have aggravated the economic conditions. As a result, the higher and firmer revenue buoyancy relative to the Centre’s that most states have seemingly enjoyed in post-crisis years is wearing off. A vicious cycle may have been created.
Maharashtra, for instance, saw flat growth in VAT revenue in FY14 from 20% in the previous year and 23% in the year before that. While some faulty revenue-augmentation steps helped Gujarat achieve VAT revenue growth of 52% in FY12, it dropped to 17% (budget estimate) in FY14.
A moderation in the overall state-VAT revenue growth is also increasingly visible, with growth declining from 26.4% in FY11 to 23.7% in FY12 and further, to 19% in FY13.  The budget estimate for growth in FY14 was even lower at 17.2%.
The trend in the Centre’s indirect tax revenue has been more erratic, thanks to post-crisis fiscal stimulus, its gradual  withdrawal and a longer-than-expected economic slowdown. During FY09 and FY10, the growth in the Centre’s indirect tax collections was negative – minus 3.4% and -0.2% respectively – but jumped to 41% in the subsequent year helped by the low base, but could not sustain the tempo and dipped to just 9.5% in FY14, and further to 5% in the first half of the current fiscal. States’ VAT revenue, it seems, are now to follow this trend as their faulty strategies are proving to be of only transient help.
In terms of size, the Centre’s indirect tax collections (at Rs 5.19 lakh crore in FY14) is slightly higher than the combined revenue of states from VAT (estimated Rs 4.8 lakh crore for FY14).
“Since states have the authority to change VAT laws, they are making irrational changes without understanding the implications. Transparency and removal of tax cascading, the purposes of introducing VAT, get defeated if this levy is collected from the first point of sale itself, no matter the convenience of collecting slightly more revenue from limited number of dealers at this stage,” says Mahesh C Purohit, director at Delhi-based Foundation for Public Economics and Policy Research. GST, by design, will not allow states to make changes in tax rates or in the relevant rules, he adds.

ET Awards: Small steps will lead to big change  say Modi MantrisBharti Airtel
(This govt will take what…)
MUMBAI: Impatient industry leaders who streamed in large numbers into the ET Awards for Corporate Excellence on Saturday looking for announcements on big-bang reforms from the top ministers in the Narendra Modi government were instead told that they could expect a series of measures that will leave a lasting impression.
This government will take what may look like small steps, but will push through important legislation and clear regulatory cobwebs which are crippling businesses, and their impact will be such that the 'Make in India' project of PM Modi will become a reality rather than remain a slogan.
Liberalisation of investment regulations will be dictated by national interest instead of aiming to just enrich a few, and leave out millions as in the past when employment generation lagged economic growth.
"The objective was capacity building, so at 49% (in defence) we have had a reasonable good initial period," said Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. "I do not think there are too many amongst the captains of the industry here who are going to invest 49% in defence only to become minority shareholders.
People are approaching Indian corporates for joint ventures."
The proof of the pudding is in the eating, Power & Coal Minister Piyush Goyal told the galaxy of CEOs and entrepreneurs during a panel discussion, which included Bharti Airtel's Sunil Mittal, ITC's YC Deveshwar and Diageo Plc's Ivan Menezes.
"We sorted out a 40-year story in less than 40 days," said minister Piyush Goyal.
"I have yet to read one editorial which has been able to find flaw in that ordinance," said Power & Coal Minister Piyush Goyal. "We stand for whatever we say and we will take every step required to meet expectations of people and get achhe din."
The Lok Sabha should pass the Bill in the next few days, Goyal said. When asked if the joint session route could be used in case the government experienced difficulty in getting the Bill through Rajya Sabha, Goyal said the government would explore "any route" to get the Bill through.
Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar said the country's defence policy will be tailored in such a way that the world's biggest importer of defence equipment will produce more of its needs at home, even if it is done by a multinational company. "We are working on policies where Make in India becomes a reality in this sector," said Parrikar. "If we are the biggest customer, why cannot I get things done in my country, at least initially even if it is by global (companies)."
Industry captains who were worried that 'big-bang' reforms are absent and that the government was sounding nationalistic in a throwback to the days of socialism were assured that national interest need not necessarily be anti-business and trade. Although the postponement of the Trade Facilitation Agreement under the World Trade Organization caused a lot of anxiety, the way the government handled the issue leads one to believe that the nation is in safe hands, said Sunil Mittal, founder of Bharti Airtel.
"At one point in time (I felt) that either the WTO will collapse or we will be isolated in the whole process and that other countries will move forward," said Mittal. "This government showed nerves of steel. When the whole world, and this time mind you most emerging countries were also not behind us, then to stand alone and say we want to protect our agriculture, we want to protect our procurement... I think you have done a fantastic job. I personally feel we are blessed to have a government like this."
  Be it defence, retail, power or coal, the common thread of policymaking will be that there is a level-playing field and there is no favouritism towards any single group, or an individual.
The government will take time to decide, but it will come up with a foolproof mechanism.
"It is the role of technology which is very difficult for anyone to put a brake on," Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharam said, when questioned on the talk of restrictions on ecommerce. "But at the same time, I would not want to rush in to say either way because our position, on say multi-brand retail, is very clear.
But nothing more at this stage."
Indeed, as the debate progressed, it became evident that chief executives are worried more about the nitty-gritty of doing business which the Modi government is focusing on rather than limits on foreign ownership, and dominance of inefficient state-run enterprises in many fields.
"We need 250,000 approvals in one year... licences and approvals in one year," said Menezes of Diageo, which bought United Spirits in a $3-billion transaction. "I would hope with the direction we are taking, that number comes down drastically. I mean that will unleash economic activity, growth that will cause us to invest. It will raise more employment."
Part of the industry's worries were addressed right on the spot.

("The recent unveiling of…)
Geoff Lewis, executive director and global market strategist at JPMorgan AMC, has said the government policy reforms tabled so far have not been surprising, but rather they appear to be many small steps in the right direction. The introduction of new projects and return of Indian entrepreneurs' animal spirits will take time before showing more visible effect. Edited excerpts from an interview with ET..
How do you think the Bank of Japan's stimulus announcement and European Central Bank's (ECB) likely quantitative easing will aid emerging markets' equity performance?
The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan must continue to expand their balance sheets to fight deflationary pressures.
Despite some increase in volatility, overall global liquidity for markets should remain flush. In emerging markets, we continue to expect an uncomfortable period of adjustment in 2015 relating to recent rapid build-up in debt together with strengthening of the US dollar.
The US Federal Reserve prepares to hike rates next year. How do you think this will impact global financial markets?
While the US continues to normalise its monetary policies, the key implications are --stronger US dollar, continued weakness in global commodity prices, and looser monetary conditions globally. We expect very gradual and cautious raising of short-term US interest rates by the Federal Reserve in the second half of 2014. We believe that the impact on markets when it happens will be more benign than many investors are currently fearing.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has completed over 6 months in his office. How do you rate the performance of new government against expectations?
One of the most crucial issues for Modi's government has been the reforms necessary to stem major issues the country is currently facing - raising economic growth from multi-year lows, taming inflation, and getting spiralling deficits under control. And Modi seems to have taken long-term view on solving these issues, considering that he has at least one full term of around 5 years and quite likely the second to push forward his plans. So far, the reforms tabled have not been surprising, but rather they appear to be many small steps in right direction that in sum are likely to have a material impact over a period of time.
What is your view on government reform policies, and do you think they are right enough to bring back India's economic growth back on track?
The recent unveiling of the 'Make in India' campaign aimed at attracting business to set up manufacturing in India will hopefully add to the positive investment climate.
Modinomics will only succeed in the longer term if it can galvanise the private sector.
Government policies alone will not be enough to restore GDP growth to 6.5% or higher. The recent uptick in capex is a good sign while the introduction of new projects and the return of Indian entrepreneurs' animal spirits will take time before having a more visible effect. A GDP growth rate close to 7% should be possible for India over the medium term.
  How do you think easing global commodity prices can boost India's prospects for faster economic growth?
The cheaper oil prices have been in particular a boon for Modi, who reassuringly took the opportunity provided to deregulate the retail diesel price and streamline various fuel subsides. These cuts will also help the Modi government in its attempt to reach the fiscal deficit target of around 4% of GDP. More rapid progress in defeating inflation will help bring forward the timing of monetary easing and interest rate cuts.
RBI has expressed to break the back of inflation before considering monetary policy decisions. What is your outlook on interest rates scenario?
Inflation has now fallen below RBI's 6% target for January 2016, causing some speculation of a rate cut in the near future, possibly even at the December meeting. We would not expect the first interest rate cut to come from RBI until February. However, we also recognise that with inflation having fallen so quickly, there will be growing impatience within some parts of the new government to see the benefits of rate cut. RBI may come under growing political pressure the longer it holds out while FIIs will not wish to see any major rift on monetary policy between the Modi administration and India's central bank.
What are your earnings growth expectations?
There has so far been little sign of pick-up in consensus earnings, but we believe that we are getting closer to a major inflection point for earnings. Over the medium term, a compounded growth (CAGR) of 15-18% for Indian equity markets should be achievable if Modi's programme to raise potential growth is a success.
What's your biggest concern about Indian markets?
In the short term , the rather disappointing earnings season YTD, and investor impatience over the speed of cyclical recovery or with the progress of Modinomics might become the trigger for more significant locally-driven market correction than in October. Such a market correction would offer investors who are late to India story a good entry point as we believe that the next big theme for the Indian equity market is likely to be a strong domestically-led secular recovery in earnings.
What are your economic growth expectations for FY16?
Six percent appears conservative as forecast for GDP growth in CY2015 as many sell-side brokers have pencilled in a figure that is closer to 7% than 6%. If all goes well, then 6.5% is possible, but we would caution against investors looking for an early return to higher growth path without the prior implementation of supply-side reforms and visible improvement in trend productivity.

India emerges as Dominos biggest market out...India emerges as Domino’s biggest market outside US

Domino’s
(India got to second rank…)
NEW DELHI: Domino's, the world's largest pizza delivery chain, sells more pizzas in India than anywhere else outside its home country — the US.
Domino's Pizza India, run by the Bhartia family-promoted Jubilant FoodWorks , now makes and sells four lakh pizzas every day, or more than 12 crore pizzas a year — about twice the number of burgers McDonald's sells in India.
This month Domino's India overtook its UK counterpart in store count to become the largest international market for the company outside the US. As of November 29, there are 818 Domino's Pizza restaurants in India across 173 cities.
"India is the only country where we are double the size of McDonald's," said Ajay Kaul, CEO, Jubilant FoodWorks.
And he still sees huge scope for growth. "We believe we are scratching the surface... over 15 million people are consuming us every year, but half of those consumers are consuming us only once a year," Kaul said.
It's this opportunity that has persuaded Domino's, with global retail sales of $8 billion, to expand its reach in the Indian market aggressively despite the slowdown in the quick service sector with people checking their discretionary spending. In second quarter, Jubilant FoodWorks' same-store sales growth slowed to 5.3 per cent compared with 6.6 per cent a year earlier.
The company, which also operates the Dunkin' Donuts chain in the country, reported a 12.7 per cent year-on-year drop in its standalone net profit for the second quarter at Rs 29 crore as it spent big on opening new stores.
It plans to continue expanding its reach at a fast clip. Kaul said Domino's is looking to set up 150 new stores every year and hopes to touch 1,500 to 2,000 stores by 2020. He said people like eating pizza in smaller markets such as Patna, Salem and Kanpur as much as they do Delhi or Mumbai.
India got to second rank in the Domino's universe within 18 years. However, India is a distant No. 2 to the US, where Domino's operates more than 5,000 stores.
Patrick Doyle, global president and CEO at Domino's Pizza, said he was not surprised by the India success because of the quality of people the company has.
"India now has more stores than any market outside of the US. Clearly, it is a major priority for us and will continue to be," he told ET in an email. So why have Indians taken to pizza in such a big way? Kaul said it's quite simple — cultural affinity.
"Pizzas resonate with Indian consumption habits as they look like chapatis, have a wheat base, are eaten with hands instead of forks and spoons, and the same pizza is often shared by slices and has either vegetables or chicken toppings," he explained.
Then there's the seemingly infinite variety afforded by the mix-and-match aspect of toppings. "We Indians like combinations and variety in our food and a pizza allows all of that, unlike a burger or any other global food product," said Santosh Desai, social commentator and MD and CEO of Future Brands . Another big factor is the price. At the entry level rate of 49, Domino's pizzas in India are also the lowest priced in the world.
As it steps up store count, Domino's is shrinking coverage areas — so that it can continue to deliver pizzas within 30 minutes. Its delivery bikes, sourced from Hero, come fitted with speed governors that prevent the drivers from going too fast. "We call our delivery men 'safe delivery persons' and (still) try to ensure that the average delivery time is 22 minutes," Kaul said.

Industry for cheaper e-Visa on arrival  more...ETA
("It is not a foregone conclusion…)
NEW DELHI: India's move to introduce e-visa on arrival for visitors from 43 countries could have been more effective with a lower fee and inclusion of nations that generally account for a large share of inbound tourists, industry executives and experts have said.
As per the electronic tourist authorisation (ETA) facility, applications will be allowed four days prior to travel to nine airports - Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram, Hyderabad and Goa.
However, India will levy a fee of $60 per passenger (excluding interchange charge for credit/debit cards), compared to $15 Sri Lanka charges from nationals of SAARC countries and $30 of others.
Tourists will have to pay about Rs 3,700 for Indian visa. The industry, within India and abroad, has expressed cautious optimism over the move. "India's current visa system is a challenge for many potential visitors, so it's great to see the government committed to reforming it. Our research shows that visa facilitation, including e-visas, could result in the creation of up to five million jobs in G20 countries," said David Scowsill, president and COO of the London-based World Travel & Tourism Council.
According to research by UNWTO and the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), improving visa processes could generate an additional $206 billion in tourism receipts by 2015 in G20 economies.
Most countries that have implemented similar schemes have seen an increase in tourist arrivals. In March 2009, the UK began allowing tourists from Taiwan staying less than six months to enter the UK without a visa. Arrivals increased sharply in 2009 (39.6 per cent), before a correction and rebound in 2010 and 2011, respectively. In 1996, Australia introduced a similar facility and ETA accounted for an average growth in arrivals to Australia at 8.9 per cent per year, ranging from 1.7 per cent (Japan and Italy) to 19.4 per cent (Finland) over the respective three-year periods, the research showed.
An Indian tourism ministry official earlier this year said ETAs could push up inbound tourism by 10 per cent in the first year itself. Last year, India recorded about 6.97 million tourist arrivals, a 5 per cent increase over 2012.
"It is not a foregone conclusion that every tourist will now want to come to India. I only see the tourist arrival numbers doubling in the next five to seven years," said Vikram Madhok, managing director of travel agency Abercrombie and Kent India.
Another tour operator Dipak Deva, director and CEO, destination management, India and South Asia of Kuoni said the government must consider countries like France, Switzerland and UK immediately in its list since these countries can add 10-12 per cent tourists to India.
Sri Lanka introduced the ETA facility in 2012, after which it has seen a higher number of tourists coming into the country. Travel agency TUI India's MD Arjun Sharma said the government should consider reducing the fees as well as possibly offer discounts during the off-season summer months.
In November 2008, the US, too, expanded its visa waiver programme. Consequently, tourist arrivals from newly added regions grew 46 per cent over the next three years while travel from these markets to other similar destinations only grew at a fraction of that rate, added the WTTC report.

Petrol  diesel prices cut on fall in oil pricesPetrol price cut by 91 paise, diesel by 84 paise per litre
BT Online Bureau     New Delhi   Last Updated: December 1, 2014  | 08:23 IST
Petrol and diesel prices were cut on Sunday as international oil rates continued to slump . This is the seventh reduction in petrol prices since August, while it is the third for diesel.
Petrol price was cut by 91 paise a litre, and diesel by 84 paise per litre, a PTI report stated.
The price reduction will be effective midnight, Indian Oil Corp, the nation's largest fuel retailer, announced in New Delhi.
In Delhi, petrol price will cost Rs.63.33 a litre as compared to Rs.64.24 per litre previously while in Mumbai the reduction will be 96 paise to Rs.70.95 per litre.
Diesel will cost Rs.52.51 a litre in Delhi from Sunday as against Rs.53.35 currently while in Mumbai the price will be cut by 93 paise to Rs.60.11 per litre.
Rates differ from state to state due to differential local sales tax or VAT rates.
The prices of petrol and diesel were last revised downwards on November 1 by Rs.2.41 a litre and Rs.2.25 per litre, respectively (including state levies at Delhi) on the back of declining international oil prices.
"Since the last price changes, the international prices of both petrol and diesel have continued to be on a downtrend.
The Rupee-USD exchange rate has however appreciated since the last price change. The combined impact of both these factors warrant a decrease in retail selling prices of both petrol and diesel," IOC said in the statement.
This is the seventh consecutive reduction in petrol prices since August and third in diesel in rates since October.
Prior to today's reduction, petrol price has been cumulatively cut by Rs.9.36 per litre since August.
Diesel price was cut for the first time in more than five years on October 19 by Rs.3.37 a litre when the government decided to deregulate the fuel. This was followed by another reduction on November 1.
"The movement of prices in international oil market and INR-USD exchange rate shall continue to be closely monitored and developing trends of the market will be reflected in future price changes," the statement said.

ATC to pick up 51% in tower company Viom for $1 bnYou are here: Home > Collections > Tatas
American Tower Corp set to pick up 51% in tower company Viom for $1 billion

American Tower Corp
(Viom’s enterprise valuation…)
NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: American Tower Corp (ATC) is close to sealing a deal worth $900 million-$1 billion to acquire a 51% stake in Viom Networks, which will be followed by a merger of the Indian unit of ATC with Viom, bringing the curtains down on year-long talks.
Viom is majority-owned by the Tatas (54%), who hold the stake through unlisted telecom arm Tata Teleservices.
Srei, promoted by the Kolkata-based Kanoria family, owns around 18.5% while the rest is held by a clutch of PE funds including IDFC Private Equity, SBI Macquarie, Oman Investment Fund, GIC of Singapore and AMP Capital.
According to multiple sources involved in the transaction, the first leg of the deal will see Srei sell its stake and exit Viom, while the Tatas will significantly pare their shareholding to 26-30%.
"While Macquarie, SBI and IDFC Private Equity will continue for certain, the decision of the other equity firms is not yet clear," said one of the people cited, referring to the first stage of the transaction.
The second phase of this twopronged process will see ATC merging its India portfolio of around 12,000 towers with Viom, which owns 42,000 towers, marking a substantial consolidation in the local telecom towers industry.
ATC will be the controlling shareholder of the merged entity, though the exact shareholding depends on the outcome of lastmile negotiations.
Viom's enterprise valuation is around Rs 18,000-19,000 crore, which includes over a billion dollars (Rs 6,500 crore) of debt.
ATC and Macquarie declined comment while the rest didn't respond to queries. One of the people quoted earlier told ET the agreement is almost final though some changes were possible.
Post merger, Tatas and remaining PE holders will get a stake in the combined entity, though their holdings will be diluted.
"In future, ATC would like to raise capital through an IPO of the combined ATC-Viom and that is when Tata Teleservices will look at a complete exit," said one the persons privy to the details of the deal, explaining why the Tatas have chosen to dilute their stake and not exit completely.
"The Tatas expect the valuations of their tower portfolio to rise under ATC's management."
Credit Suisse and Citi are the bankers to the deal.
Once signed, the deal will bring to an end over a year of protracted negotiations during which Viom's founders were also simultaneously looking at alternative means of raising funds, such as through local or an overseas listing, given the buoyancy in the stock markets.
With other suitors — which at one time included PE firms Carlyle, Providence and Malaysian telecom company Axiata, which has a significant stake in Idea Cellular — dropping out, ATC's bid remained the largest and the only formal offer.
Founded in 2009, Viom posted a profit of Rs 100 crore on revenues of Rs 4,900 crore for the year ended March 31, 2014. It recorded an operating margin of 56%. The company claims a tenancy ratio of 2.2 times and over 92,000 tenancies.
The firm trails Indus Towers, a venture promoted by the Bharti Group, Vodafone India and Aditya Birla Telecom, in India's telecom tower market, which is seeing a revival in tandem with the overall telecom sector. Indus operates some 1.1 lakh towers.
Viom gets more than 40% of its revenue from Tata Teleservices, 20% from Uninor and remaining from other operators. It has a master-level agreement to lease towers to Reliance Jio Infocomm at a market-determined price. The ATC deal would help the Tata Group pare some of the Rs28,000-crore debt of its telecom business. The funds can also be partly used to pay NTT DoCoMo for the Japanese company's stake in Tata Teleservices. The Tata Group is reportedly looking to exit the telecom sector.
Srei will use the cash for its other businesses, which include infrastructure development, and finance.
Nasdaq-listed ATC, on the other hand, has a comparatively smaller presence in the country, operating about 12,000 towers.
Last year, the company was looking to reduce its tower count as the telecom industry was going through a tough phase post the 2012 licence cancellations and the lack of investment by debt-ridden telcos.
But the US company has renewed its focus on India, with pricing power now returning to operators and the industry seeing massive growth of wireless data traffic. The successful spectrum auctions in February this year and another upcoming sale next February have also raised expectations of a spurt in tower demand as telecom operators are likely to aggressively roll out data services, which will require a large number of tower sites.

Sajjad Lone senses desire for change in J&K  ready to support BJP in its  Mission 44+Pallavi Ghosh , CNN-IBN | Dec 01, 2014 at  08:53am IST
Srinagar: As Jammu and Kashmir will vote in the second phase on Tuesday, the terror-hit areas of Kupwara and Handwara are in the fray this time and the desire for change is apparent in these constituencies. It is an apple belt but the money is limited to a handful few.
Sajjad Lone, once a separatist but has now entered into mainstream politics, sensed this desire for change in the National Conference stronghold. Lone has stirred a controversy by shaking hands with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
People's Conference leader Lone defended himself and said he has done no wrong. He even said that a new entrant like Bharatiya Janata Party should be given a chance.
Lone said, "The situation is such that there could be a hung assembly and our preference would be a new set of people should come."
Lone is hoping to ride piggyback on the charisma of the Prime Minister and in if BJP falls short in its 'Mission 44+', he is ready to support the party.
Chief Minister and NC leader Omar Abdullah, who is fighting a tough battle, made this an issue.
Omar said, "Sajjad Lone has claimed that the NC is growing closer to the BJP. But it is Lone who is warming up."

See improvement in jewellery biz & balance sheet: TitanMy balance sheet will be significantly different because there would be no debt now. It’s a natural hedge; it’s easier and much better.
S Subramanian
CFO
Titan
With the RBI on Friday easing restrictions on gold imports by scrapping the controversial 80:20 scheme, R S Subramaniam, CFO, Titan in an interview to CNBC-TV18 spoke about the benefits to the industry and his company per se.
He says the scrapping of export rule is very positive for the industry and would now reduce the arbitrage opportunity for smugglers.
"The premium is based on the scarcity and the demand-supply situation gap. The premium that was averaging around USD 75-100 per ounce over the last one year would come down to USD 3-4 per ounce level, so that is one big advantage with the removal of the curbs, " he adds.
Moreover, now with the consumer requiring to pay less in terms of premium will look at purchasing more gold jewellery, which in turn would benefit both.
"It has been decided by the Government of India to withdraw the 20:80 scheme and restrictions placed on import of gold. Accordingly, all instructions issued about the scheme from time to time...stand withdrawn with immediate effect," the RBI said in a notification.
Below is the transcript of S Subramaniam's interview with Latha Venkatesh & Sonia Shenoy on CNBC-TV18.
Latha: Tell us the spin for your company. You all have got used to the import control rule. Now that it is not there is it going to make a difference?
A: It’s great news. A good gift on Friday evening from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the government of course. Basically we did not have any problem in procuring gold during the period but the impact was seen on the high premium over the last one year or so, which touched USD 100-150 per ounce. However, it did cool off significantly in the last two-three months and now with the 80:20 removed, the premium would come back to normal USD 3-4 per ounce level, so that is a good thing which means the arbitrage opportunity for smugglers etc would come down significantly and that is good news.
Smuggling, hopefully with this should come off entirely, there maybe 10 percent customs duty but we would hopefully see more people complying with it rather than smuggle because that was an issue that we had and therefore there is a differential rate in the gold rates in the market at times. So that would now disappear. So it’s a level playing filed, its good, cost of funding should come down because with this gold only should be back entirely.
Latha: You said two specific things – (1) premium for gold falls to USD 3; falls from what to USD 3 and (2) cost of funding. On each how much would the impact be, how much would your margins improve? If you can give us the quantity
A: The premium was based on the scarcity. The demand-supply situation gap, so as I said it was averaging around USD 75-100 per ounce over the last one year. It had touched a peak of USD 150 per ounce and so on. Having said that in the last two-three months the supply situation is better, some relaxation has happened in the import curbs and therefore it had come down to about USD 10-15 per ounce levels – that would come down to USD 3 per ounce level, so that is one big advantage with the removal of the curbs.
However, we did not have much of an impact on that because we all passed on this to the consumer. It is good that the consumer now will have to play less in terms of premium, so that’s a positive from consumer perspective and therefore for us as well because one assumes that if the rates are more attractive then consumers will buy more gold, more jewellery. So that’s one expectation.
The second is cost of funding. Without gold on lease,  which was there for about six-eight months, we had to borrow at the local banking system or whatever else and of course we did get a lot back in terms of premium when we hedged ourselves internationally, so it did bring our cost down to around 3 percent level. Therefore, with gold on lease expected to be back now in full swing, we would be at the same level. However my balance sheet will be significantly different because there would be no debt now. It’s a natural hedge; it’s easier and much better.
Sonia: How much do you think the return on capital employed (RoCE) in the jewellery business could improve to now?
A: It would go back to its old levels. There was a time it touched 100 percent, I am not saying we will go back to that but 60-70 percent yes; it will go to that level.
Sonia: What about an improvement in your operating cash flows, in your free cash flows, any kind of indication on how this move maybe not now but in the last three-six months?
A: It would take some time because going forward all the gold that we buy could be on lease, we still have some which we have paid in cash so that will come off. If 100 percent of gold is going to be on lease and you get six months credit and stock turn is normally 2.2, which means we have five month holding, so we could actually be ending up with one month surplus cash which is good news. So balance sheet looks far better.
Latha: What about profit and loss (P&L), if you can tell us EBITDA margin in basis points?
A: The big difference here would be that when we had premium in the market, we unfortunately had to have swings in margins on a quarter to quarter basis, for example last quarter we had to get a charge of the high premium that were in the inventory, which we had procured two quarters before that and last quarter when we could not charge the consumer because the premiums had fallen. Those anomalies would come off entirely and that’s a great thing.
Therefore, on margin basis I do not think there will be a significant difference overall but balance sheet will be much cleaner, hedging is much easier and so on.

Tabare Vazquez’s victory in Uruguay’s presidential election is a show of support for the leftist coalition that has governed the country for the past decade and allows the government to proceed with its plan to create the world’s first state-run marijuana marketplace.
Vazquez, a 74-year-old oncologist who was president from 2005 to 2010, topped center-right rival Luis Lacalle Pou of the National Party 53 percent to 40 percent in Sunday’s vote.
The runoff vote drew international attention after Lacalle Pou promised to undo much of the pioneering plan to put the government in charge of regulating the production, distribution and sale of marijuana on a nationwide scale. Vazquez, meanwhile, said he would proceed with it, unless it produced negative results.
As results came in, Lacalle Pou called Vazquez to concede and wish him “great success,” while supporters of Vazquez’s Broad Front coalition poured into the streets to celebrate.
In his victory speech, Vazquez called on the opposition to join him in a national accord to deal with the issues of public security, health and education. “I want to be able to count on all Uruguayans, but not so they follow me, so they guide me, accompany me.”
Sunday’s win marked a reversal of roles for Vazquez, who shook up Uruguayan politics when he became president the first time, peacefully ending 170 years of two-party dominance. In his first presidential campaign, Vazquez promised changes that would “shake the roots of the trees.” But he governed as a relatively cautious moderate, avoiding the constitutional changes and polarization that have shaken countries such as Venezuela.
His popularity on leaving office paved the way for the election of his successor, current President Jose Mujica, a former guerrilla known for his humble lifestyle and straight talk. Both men belong to the Broad Front coalition, which has been in power for a decade and has passed laws same-sex marriage, abortion and marijuana.
This time around, Mujica’s popularity and a strong economy helped propel Vazquez into office, where he is now seen as the candidate of continuity, not of change.
Javier Silva, an operator at a state electrical plant, said he voted for Vazquez because he thinks the country is doing well.
“The economy is rising. The country isn’t anything like it was 10 or 20 years ago, when it was in decline,” said the 35-year-old.
Monica Centurion, an official at a state hospital, said she voted for Lacalle Pou because of his pledge to improve public security, which “is the principal issue.”
Vazquez immediately moved to calm fears that he would introduce radical change in his second term.
“Within the Constitution and the law everything. Outside the Constitution and the law nothing,” he told party militants after his win was announced.
Lacalle Pou is the son of another ex-president, Luis Alberto Lacalle Herrera, who governed from 1990 to 1995.
During his campaign, he criticized the marijuana plan, saying he continued…

Shares in Sun Pharmaceutical  and Ranbaxy Laboratories  were up 1 and 2 percent respectively in early Mumbai trading after the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) approved the merger announced between the two giants early this year.
In a filing to the stock exchange, Sun noted that the FIPB had “approved the proposal of the company for issuing equity shares of the company to the non-resident investors of Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited pursuant to the merger of Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited into Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited.”
The mega USD 4 billion deal, which will create the world’s fifth largest pharmaceutical company by sales, is yet to receive approval from competition watchdogs in India (Competition Commission of India) and the US (Federal Trade Commission) and there are concerns the deal may get delayed as it is likely to create to dominant market share for the merged company in certain key segments.
“The interactions with the agencies continue and we are seeing a lot of progress on both these sides. At an appropriate stage we will probably announce when we reach something of a milestone,” Sun CFO Uday Baldota told CNBC-TV18 in an interview in November.

Rupee slumps to fresh 9-month low of 62.25Rupee ends flat at 62.02
Our Bureau
Tweet
Mumbai, Dec 1:  
The rupee erased its earlier losses during the day to end almost flat at 62.02 to the dollar against Friday’s close of 62.03 due to the American dollar's gains against other currencies overseas.
Rupee under pressure ahead of monetary policy, below 62 again. The $24 bn of FPI money that moved in to debt this year is at stake here.
— lokeshwarri sk (@lokeshwarri) December 1, 2014
In intra-day trade, the domestic unit touched a high of 62.25 and a low of 62.02. According to market watchers, dealers avoided taking long positions ahead of the Reserve Bank of India’s bi-monthly monetary policy review tomorrow.
Bond yields slip to 8.03%
Yield on the benchmark 10-year bond hit 8.03 per cent, the lowest level since August 2013, on continued fall in global crude prices. Brent crude prices were near four-year lows after oil producers’ club OPEC decided to not cut oil output. Harihar Krishnamoorthy, treasurer at FirstRandBank, said, “The market believes that the OPEC’s decision to not cutback production will last for some time.” According to NS Venkatesh, Executive Director (Treasury & International Banking), IDBI Bank, the market has been showing irrational exuberance and if the RBI does not cut rates in the policy announcement scheduled tomorrow, it may lead to hardening of bond yields to 8.15 per cent levels.

Imran Khan threatens to shut down Pakistan by Dec 16By: Press Trust of India | Islamabad |
Posted: December 1, 2014 10:38 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 3:52 pm
Pakistan’s opposition leader Imran Khan on Sunday threatened to “shut down” the entire country by December 16 if the Nawaz Sharif Government failed to initiate an impartial probe into the alleged rigging in 2013 general elections.
The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chief, in a rally here outside the Parliament, said that his protest will continue till the government initiate an inquiry into the “massive rigging” in last year’s general elections, which saw Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) win by a landslide.
“The ball is in your court, Nawaz Sharif — do your talks, do your investigations and solve the issue. We will close Pakistan down when December 16 comes, and what I do after that you will not be able to bear it…It has been 109 days and Naya Pakistan is waking up every day. We can all see it,” Khan was quoted as saying by Dawn.
“On Thursday (December 4), I will go to Lahore and shut it down. On December 8 I will shut down Faisalabad, on December 12 I will go to Karachi and shut it down. By December 16 I will shut down all of Pakistan if the poll inquiry is not initiated,” Khan said.
The cricketer-turned-politician has been holding protest-rallies in different cities to spread his movement, demanding a probe into the allegations of rigging the election.
Khan had launched his protest in mid-August, demanding Sharif’s ouster, but he later withdrew his main demand of the Prime Minister’s resignation ahead of the probe and offered the government to constitute a judicial commission comprising Supreme Court judges, ISI and Military Intelligence officials, to investigate the reported rigging.
December 16 is considered as a tragic day in the history of Pakistan as the country lost its eastern wing after a war with India when its army surrendered and Bangladesh emerged as an independent country.
The PTI leader said that if his demand for the impartial inquiry of the elections was not met, he would make the functioning of government “impossible”.
He alleged that the Nawaz Sahrif government is promoting corruption and politics of patronage.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister’s spokesman, Mussadik Malik said that it was “unfortunate” that Khan had threatened to “shut down” the country.
“What he want to achieve through it. I urge him to leave the politics of agitation and enter into a meaningful dialogue to achieve his objectives,” he said.
Minister for Railways Saad Rafiq said such announcements cannot be made by a patriotic person.
“Imran wants to spread anarchy and derail democracy in the disguise of bringing true democracy,” he said.

Fans should simply hold onto their tickets until further notice  says Cricket AustraliaBy: Reuters | Sydney |
Posted: December 1, 2014 10:06 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 1:17 pm
Cricket Australia and the Indian board (BCCI) remain in discussions over the future of the first Test between the two countries that was supposed to have started on Thursday in Brisbane.
The Dec. 4-8 match at the Gabba was postponed indefinitely on Saturday, following the death last Thursday of Australia batsman Phillip Hughes.
Hughes died two days after he was struck in the head by a short-pitched delivery in a first class game at the Sydney Cricket Ground, with his death causing an outpouring of emotion, sympathy and support from inside and outside the cricketing world.
“We know that there are many people who have purchased tickets to the test match who will be wondering what happens next ,” Cricket Australia James Sutherland told the cricket.com.au website on Monday.
“Once the situation has been resolved, we will advise them as a priority. Fans should simply hold onto their tickets until further notice.”
Local media reported that a decision on the test was likely to be made later on Monday, with the India team expected to arrive in Brisbane to begin their preparations.
A two-day game against an Australian XI in Adelaide scheduled for last Friday and Saturday was cancelled following Hughes’s death.
The funeral for the left-hander, who would have turned 26 on Sunday, will be held in his hometown of Macksville in northern New South Wales on Wednesday, with the timing of that considered a major determinant in postponing the first Test.
The fate of the first Test, however, had been in the balance even before Hughes died of his horrific injury as many of the Australia team were among his closest friends and few expected them to be mentally ready for the game anyway.
TV rights make an incoming tour by the India test team by far the most lucrative in the world game so cancellation of the Brisbane match is unlikely.
There is precious little room for manoeuvre, however, with the second Test scheduled to take place in Adelaide from Dec. 12-16 with the third starting on Boxing Day (Dec. 26) in Melbourne and the fourth in Sydney running from Jan. 3-7.

Ministry of External Affairs to lobby Korea, Japan for shipping technology
Ruchika Chitravanshi, ET Bureau Dec 1, 2014, 10.24AM IST

Cochin Shipyard
(“Why should these companies…)
NEW DELHI: GAIL India needs nine ships to ferry six million tonnes of liquefied natural gas that it's contracted to buy from the US starting September 2017. Of these, three LNG carriers need to be made in India.
But with key South Korean and Japanese shipbuilders staying away from bidding process for this, the shipping ministry has called on the foreign ministry for assistance.
The idea is to lobby South Korea to push its companies to provide technology support to domestic yards, especially since Samsung and Hyundai—both of which have shipbuilding arms of repute— have found a lucrative market in India for their refrigerators, cars, phones and other products. This is their chance to play a significant in the Make in India campaign to make the country a manufacturing base, the shipping ministry has argued.
"Why should these companies keep themselves only to auto, telecom sectors when we can really use their expertise in a crucial area like shipbuilding," a senior government official said. There doesn't seem to be much time left. Since India does not have the expertise, an international partner has to be finalised by 2015 to provide quality assurance, training and supervision.
The Shipping Corporation will be running these ships in partnership with GAIL. Only one company, South Korea's STX Offshore, has thus far agreed to share technology to make LNG vessels at Indian shipyards.
While STX Offshore matches most of the bid requirements, its poor net worth and weak order book raise concerns about viability. To be sure, the South Korean Development Bank , with a 97% stake in STX, has assured the government of its financial support for the GAIL project. Still, with just days to go before the last date for bids closes on December 4, GAIL is in a bit of a bind.
The shipping ministry wants leading shipbuilders, including Hyundai , Daewoo and Samsung to step up and offer to partner Indian shipyards, which have never built such vessels before. LNG carriers require highly specialised technology in order to store the gas in cryogenic conditions.
Japanese and South Korean shipyards are known for their expertise in making such vessels at a price that's competitive compared with European yards. However, government officials said that countries guard this knowhow closely and do not want to part with it even on commercial terms, which is why so few bids have come in.
Japanese yards have cited a labour crunch and said they don't have enough personnel to supervise construction in India, with too many orders to meet. Cochin Shipyard , which has partnered with Japan in ship design and construction before, failed to get a positive response from companies there.

ET Awards 2014: Modi government has revived investor sentiment  but challenge is to ensure that India clocks 8% or more GDP growthArun Jaitley
(At ET Awards 2014, Bodhisatva…)
At ET Awards 2014, Bodhisatva Ganguli (BG) finds out from the policy makers and business leaders whether India would be able to achieve the tall targets of economic and business growth.
BG: Let me yet again thank the ministers and the CEOs for taking time out on a Saturday, especially the ministers, as we all know 7.30 pm on a Saturday evening is peak working time in the Modi administration.
On a more serious note, there can be little doubt that PM Modi has lifted spirits, not just by reviving investor sentiment but also by galvanising the people at large through initiatives like Swachh Bharat. However, things need to change on the ground, and the ministers on the dais are tasked with doing just that. One of the strategies which the government has pursued is to focus on areas such as defence and railways and tourism, which have so far been left out of the ambit of reforms. So, let me turn to Mr Parrikar first. Mr Parrikar, defence is one area where the government has already raised the FDI limit and it seems to be a thrust area of the PM's 'Make In India' campaign. Could you give us a sense of your priorities?
MANOHAR PARRIKAR: You chose to shoot me down first. I will put it in one line. It is a huge potential for the Indian industry and obviously for contributing to industrial production. We are working on policies where 'Make In India' becomes reality in this sector.
BG: Mr Jaitley, would you like to weigh in on the subject?
ARUN JAITLEY: I think we got our priorities right as far as defence was concerned on day one. The priority was domestic production and preparedness. Now, you can't indefinitely have a system where you continue to be the largest importer in the world, and for almost monopoly items or rare items, huge prices are quoted. And you don't make any effort to start this whole process of domestic production.
Now, defence is symptomatic of what ailed the previous government. Probably, the (then) prime minister favoured raising the caps, but one minister, the then defence minister, vetoed it. Now, in the very first 10 to 15 days of our government, we took a policy decision to raise the cap to 49%. Within days, it was announced in the Budget.
A criticism was made, including by The Economic Times, why not make it 51%? I don't think there are too many among the captains of the industry here who are going to invest 49% in defence only to become minority shareholders. Therefore, 51%, as in Sunil (Mittal's) industry, would soon become 74% and soon become probably even more. So, all you will have is plants being shifted from Germany or the United States to India. That was not the objective. The objective was capacity-building. So, at 49%, we have had a reasonable good initial period.
People are approaching Indian corporates for joint ventures. And the second priority is procurement. In the last five to six months, we have started this culture, a monthly meeting of the defence acquisition council.
As far as allocation of resources is concerned, I think it gets top priority. And considering the area, the region of the world we live in, hopefully there is no future aggression.
But if it is, it could be a dual aggression and, therefore, you need far greater preparedness than you had in the past. I think that is what we are preparing ourselves for, that is best defence that India has.
BG: Mr Parrikar, do you see major defence equipment, let us say aircraft or tanks or submarines, being made by the Indian private sector?
MANOHAR PARRIKAR: It depends on the quantum, technology, technology transfer There are many issues. It is easier said than done. But I think we have begun well and we will push through so that over a period of one or two years, we get a lot of things. If we are the biggest customer, why can't I get things done in my country?
At least initially, it can be with technology transfer in some cases, it can be with transfer of components and offset properly designed. Ultimately, I think the political mind and minds from the industry side also need to go into it, otherwise the bureaucratic mind sometimes creates a very funny situation.
I was going through the latest policy draft of 80-20, where development is supposed to be sponsored by the government to the extent of 80% of the development cost.
Now, there was one very funny line there.
For the 80% supposed to be released in phases, there was a clause put in that we should obtain 5% bank guarantee for releasing that support. I never understood the logic of that 5%. I said you can very well give him 75% instead of 80%. But the psychology is when you give money, get some bank guarantee, otherwise you are actually giving it for development and you give it only on achievement of certain parameters. But they had this line, so it needs to be fine-tuned based on the industry's perception so that it really takes off and does not get stuck up.

Factory growth in Nov fastest in nearly 2 years: PMIManufacturing PMI at 21-month high in November
BS Reporter | New Delhi Dec 02, 2014 12:59 AM IST
In November, manufacturing activity in India rose to a 21-month high, though that didn’t lead to additional hiring, showed the HSBC Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), released on Monday.
The data also pointed to an uptick in price pressure, owing to a commentator on the report advising the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to hold policy rates at its monetary policy review on Tuesday, despite persistent demands from India Inc to ease rates.
For November, the PMI rose to 53.3 points from 51.6 points in October. Monday’s data come a few days after official data showed India’s economy grew 5.3 per cent in the quarter ended September, against 5.7 per cent in the previous one, owing to the manufacturing sector expanding only 0.1 per cent in the September quarter, against 3.5 per cent in the previous one.
A reading of more than 50 in the PMI for manufacturing, based on a survey of about 500 private firms, means expansion, while a reading of less than 50 shows contraction. The survey includes output, outlook and confidence of respondents.
The improvement in conditions in manufacturing, the 13th consecutive rise, was across segments, said Markit Economics, which compiled the data. It added the performance of the consumer goods segment was the best in the broad areas monitored. However, official data on the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) hasn’t shown any sustained uptick in consumer goods this year, at least in the durables segment. In September, for instance, consumer goods production declined 11.35 per cent, while production of consumer non-durables rose just 1.5 per cent.
In November, growth in production in the manufacturing sector was the highest since February, 2013, which Markit Economics attributed to rising new work inflows. “November data reinforced reports of stronger-than-expected demand, as new order growth accelerated to the quickest in 21 months,” the firm said.
This trend, too, was in contrast to official data, which showed exports had declined in October.
“Manufacturing activity accelerated further in November, led by higher output and new orders. Domestic orders saw the biggest increase, even as new export orders continued to be strong,” said Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC.
Despite accelerated expansion in output and new business, employment in the Indian manufacturing sector remained broadly unchanged, said a commentary released along with the data.
Just a day ahead of the RBI's monetary policy review, Markit Economics said higher prices of metals, chemicals and energy led to a significant rise in input costs in November, the 68th month of cost inflation. Also, inflationary pressures intensified during the month, following three consecutive months of easing.
Among the surveyed sub-categories, the sharpest increase in input costs was seen in the intermediate goods segment.
Rising input costs, along with improving demand, drove output prices higher in November. The rise in output inflation rose to the highest in five months.
“The sharp rise in input prices was surprising, but future prints might be lower as falling commodity prices eventually lead to softer intermediate goods prices,” said Bhandari. The pick-up in output prices, he added, could signal a revival in pricing power among businesses.
“Higher output and an uptick in final prices should convince RBI to stay on hold at its coming meeting,” Bhandari said.
 

Facebook s popularity dropping Study finds teens are not hooked to FB anymore!By: Press Trust of India | Washington |
Posted: November 28, 2014 10:52 am | Updated: November 28, 2014 8:38 pm
Teens are increasingly spending less time on Facebook than on instant messaging apps, with many saying the social network is not as “cool” as it used to be, a new study involving 170,000 internet users says.
As many as 50 per cent participants in the study said they were using Facebook less frequently than they did in the past.
When you look at just the teens in the US and the UK, 64 per cent said they are spending less time on Facebook because they are bored, marketingpilgrim.com reported.
Twenty seven per cent of teens said Facebook is not as cool as it used to be. As many as 29 per cent said they are not on Facebook as often.
The study noted that teens are still communicating digitally, but now they are doing it via Instagram and messaging apps.
According to the GlobalWebIndex (GWI) Social Summary for Q3 2014, even though Facebook has more users, activity such as photo sharing and messaging has fallen off by 20 per cent in the last two years.
This could prove that apps are eating into Facebook’s business or maybe people are just getting bored with sharing their entire life in videos, pictures and 20 word blurbs.
The report found that although Facebook has a drop in active users, its Messenger is very popular among teens, leaving even WhatsApp behind as the most used messaging app.

Queen of crime writing PD James dies at 94By: Associated Press |
Posted: November 28, 2014 12:18 pm
P.D. James took the classic British detective story into tough modern terrain, complete with troubled relationships and brutal violence, and never accepted that crime writing was second-class literature.
James, who has died aged 94, is best known as the creator of sensitive Scotland Yard sleuth Adam Dalgliesh. But her wickedly acute imagination ranged widely, inserting a murder into the mannered world of Jane Austen in “Death Comes to Pemberley” and creating a bleak dystopian future in “The Children of Men.”
James told the Associated Press in 2006 that she was drawn to mystery novels because they “tell us more … about the social mores about the time in which they were written than the more prestigious literature.”
Publisher Faber and Faber said James died peacefully on Thursday at her home in Oxford, southern England.
Faber, James’ publisher for more than 50 years, said in a statement that she had been “so very remarkable in every aspect of her life, an inspiration and great friend to us all.”
James’ books sold millions of copies around the world, and most were just as popular when adapted for television.
Because of the quality and careful structure of her writing — and her elegant, intellectual detective Dalgliesh — she was at first seen as a natural successor to writers like Dorothy L. Sayers, creator of Lord Peter Wimsey, in the between-the-wars “Golden Age” of the mystery novel.
But James’ books were strong on character, avoided stereotype and touched on distinctly modern problems including drugs, child abuse, terrorism and nuclear contamination.
Novelist A.S Byatt said the realism of James’ writing was one of its strengths.
“When people in her books died the other characters’ lives changed as they would in real life,” Byatt told the BBC. “Phyllis (James) was working with real people that she cared about.
“The world will be a worse place without her.”
Although there was nothing remotely genteel about P.D. James’ writing, she was criticized by some younger writers of gritty urban crime novels.
They accused her of snobbery because she liked to write about middle-class murderers, preferably intelligent and well-educated, who agonize over right and wrong and spend time planning and justifying their crimes. Dalgliesh of Scotland Yard, hero of more than a dozen of James’ 20 novels, is a decidedly gentlemanly detective, who writes poetry, loves jazz and drives a Jaguar.
James was unapologetic. She said her interest was in what made people tick.
“The greatest mystery of all is the human heart,” she said in a 1997 interview, “and that is the mystery with which all good novelists, I think, are concerned. I’m always interested in what makes people the sort of people they are.”
Phyllis Dorothy James was born in Oxford on Aug. 3, 1920. Her continued…

Frequent fliers from West Asia under scannerFrequent fliers from West Asia under scanner
Timsy Jaipuria , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, November 28, 2014

Next time you are travelling business-class, especially to any of the locations in the West Asia or coming back to India from there, even a cautious approach cannot save you from a close watch from the revenue department.
According to sources at the department of revenue intelligence (DRI), the hunt for black money and smuggled gold has prompted them to increase surveillance on frequent flyers to and from this region.
“There have been concerns about smuggling of gold and black money transfers from West Asia, field formations are in the process of being drafted. We have asked for a close watch on these frequent flyers,” said a senior DRI official on the condition of anonymity.
 
He further said that to facilitate aggregation of details of flyers, customs officials across airports have been engaged. “We have asked the customs department to facilitate with thw details, even the foreigner regional registration offices have been roped in,” the senior official added.
It has also been observed that there are people, who have been flying to this region not just from metros but also from other places in India, the official said. The details will soon be submitted to the revenue department.
Traditionally, West Asia, especially Dubai, has been one of the most popular investment destinations for Indians due to its favourable tax rules.
In another observation by the DRI, the official said that a lot of black money is moving in and out through foreign exchange (forex) issued by banks to exporters and importers. “We have also informed the senior officials of revenue department that exporters and importers are drawing forex from banks but these imports are actually not received in the country... Traders are also drawing duty benefits against such imports and exports, which again are not physically happening. Of late, this pattern has become very common in commodity trades through forged documents,” he added.
The DRI is looking to take a substantive action in this regard soon, the official said.
The search for black money has also made the government rethink its tax system. Finance minister Arun Jaitley had recently said that India is moving towards a tax friendly regime to correct its image, which has become ‘bad’ over the years, to improve the investment environment.

Ex-cricketer Dilip Doshi files suit against Mont Blanc for Tata tie-upComments
He introduced the luxury products of Mont Blanc in India almost two decades ago, but now the relationship between Indian cricketer-turned-businessman Dilip Doshi and the Swiss luxury pen major has turned so bad that Doshi filed a civil suit against the latter in a court in Rajkot alleging fraud.
Doshi
The civil suit he filed alleges that the Swiss company resorted to “fraud to weaken business and misused confidential information” secured from Doshi’s firm. The suit has been filed by Dilip Doshi and his company Entrack International Trading, against Mont Blanc and Mont Blanc’s parent company Richemont.
Doshi introduced Mont Blanc luxury pens in India in the 1990s, and there are around 17 boutique stores across India, particularly in five-star hotels. But in March this year, Mont Blanc reportedly snapped those ties and signed a joint venture with Titan Industries, a Tata Group company, to expand business through exclusive stores.
Dilip Doshi was not available for comment. An executive at Entrack International in Rajkot said the company would not comment as the matter is sub-judice. Queries mailed to Mont Blanc also remained unanswered.
The special civil suit was registered in the local court in Rajkot on September 26. On November 19, the additional senior civil judge quashed Mont Blanc’s argument that the case be referred to Swiss arbitration, and also ordered it to not seek arbitration.
The judge also rejected Mont Blanc’s contention that the court doesn’t have the jurisdiction over the matter.
The next hearing is scheduled for December 2.

GDP growth slows to 5.3% during July-Sept 2014Comments
India's economy grew at a slower 5.3% during July to September, from the previous quarter's 5.7%, intensifying pressure on the RBI to cut interest rates and reinforcing the need for speedier reforms to arrest the slide.
Data on India's GDP growth will tell us if the economy is back to growth. In this picture, a woman harvests a paddy field near Guwahati. (AP)
The manufacturing sector, which accounts for about 15% of India's gross domestic product (GDP), rose 0.1% during the quarter from the previous period's 3.5%.
 
Boosting output in the millions of factories lies at the core of the Narendra Modi-led government's plans to turnaround Asia's third largest economy that has grown at sub-5% in the last two years.
 
Business leaders have racheted up their demand for an interest rate cut, arguing that costly borrowing is holding back investment.
 
Stocks cantered to new highs with the 30-share BSE Sensex galloping 255.08 points to 28,693.99 and Nifty surging 94.05 points to 8,588.25 on heightened expectations that tumbling oil prices will cool inflation further and prompt the RBI to cut lending rates on December 2.
 
The government wants to boost the share of manufacturing in country's gross domestic product to 25% from about 15% now, roughly the same share of the economy as peers like Brazil and Russia but less than China's 32%.
 
Over the last six months the government has laid out the red-carpet for foreign investors with a string of initiatives such as `Make in India' initiative aimed at turning India into a manufacturing powerhouse and iron out procedural and bureaucratic irritants that are often cited as holding back investments.
 
Analysts said the pace of India's recovery will largely be determined by the rapidity at which the government is able to push through key reforms including contentious ones such as the raising the FDI cap in the insurance sector to 49% fro 26%, easing land buying rules for industry and modernising India's labour laws.
 
For 64-year-old Modi at stake is a key election promise to lift the lowest living standards among emerging markets by creating jobs for about 100 million young Indians who will enter the workforce over the next decade or so.
 
"With low energy prices, the currency stable and core inflation falling, interest rates are likely to come down. This favourable climate is creating more room to introduce "big-bang reforms"," leading industrialist said requesting not to be identified.
 
Petrol and diesel are likely to turn even cheaper in India as global oil prices slumped to four-year lows to around $70 a barrel on Thursday after OPEC-a  group of major oil supplying countries-decided against cutting back production.
 
India's retail inflation fell to a three-year low of 5.52% in October, while wholesale inflation rate plunged to five year low of 1.77%, aided by a sharp drop in vegetable and petrol prices.
 
Lower inflation, in turn, could prompt RBI to cut interest rates and nudge banks to lower lower home loan EMIs.

UIDAI to take help of EPFO to meet enrolment target

(A review showed that barely…)
NEW DELHI: The Unique Identification Authority of India has roped in the Employee Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) for the enrolment of its 8.5 crore members as it prepares to meet the target of generating Aadhaar-for-all by March 2015.
The need for involving the EPFO as a registrar was felt after an internal review by the retirement fund organisation showed that barely 10% of the EPF members under the universal account number (UAN) programme were seeded with Aadhaar, the unique identification number being issued by UIDAI.
At present, for 4.2 crore Universal Account Number (UAN) issued by the EPFO, only around 42 lakh Aadhaar numbers have been uploaded while another 21 lakh have been digitally verified by the employers since the start of the facility on October 16.
"It was noted that under the recently implemented UAN programme, the seeding of Aadhaar number in the UAN database of EPF members is very low. Hence, a meeting was recently held between UIDAI and the EPFO during which it has been decided that EPFO would sign up as registrar to enroll EPF members, who do not have an Aadhaar number," a senior government official told ET. According to the official, generation of Aadhaar under the UAN programme will help to identify the member across his different employments.
"The Aadhaar number issued by UIDAI is one of the important KYCs being seeded to extend a number of direct services to the member," he added. EPFO, which has a corpus of Rs 6.5 lakh crore, offers its members three benefits that include a lump sum EPF benefit at retirement, a monthly pension income and a life insurance cover during their working careers.
However, there have been instances in the past where members have not turned up to claim their dues after leaving jobs. Hence, the labour ministry had last month launched the UAN programme which will track employees across the globe and at any job.

Jewellers welcome scrapping of 20:80 gold import schemebullion
The scrapping of 20:80 rule for gold imports by the Reserve Bank is a surprise move and a welcome step, said India Bullion and Jewellers Association President (Emeritus) Suresh Hundia.
Gold imports had risen significantly in the last few months, and there were expectations of fresh curbs to combat it.
“It is a very welcome step and has surprised us all,’’ Suresh Hundia, president – Emeritus, India Bullion and Jewellers Assocation (IBJA) said.
Gold imports had jumped 280 per cent to $4.17 billion in October largely on expectations of fresh curbs. The 20:80 scheme was introduced in August, 2013, along with a higher import duty of 10 per cent in a move to restrict gold imports and tackle the high current account deficit (CAD) of which high gold import was a significant constituent.
Somasundaram PR, Managing Director, India, World Gold Council, said:“It reflects previous statements from the RBI and the government that gold curbs are meant to be short-term.
“The timing of this development though surprising, will definitely boost confidence in general, and in the jewellery industry, in particular.”
Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) Vice Chairman Pankaj Parikh said, “the move will put an end to the ‘monopoly’ situation, which is prevailing and also the practice of ‘dummy’ exports due to linking of imports to exports will stop.”
While reiterating that the import duty should come down from 10 per cent to 3-3.5 per cent levels to make it unviable for smugglers, Mr. Parikh expected the government to introduce a quota system for traders.

Will healthcare be the next internet money-spinnerAfter Flipkart & Makemytrip, will healthcare industry give India its next big internet business?
Rahul Sachitanand, ET Bureau Nov 30, 2014, 06.52AM IST

(A bunch of online businesses…)
Over the past decade-and-a-half, different startups have leveraged the internet to ease the day-to-day lives of consumers.
The first big opportunity arose when Makemytrip and its rivals revolutionized the travel industry by overhauling travel bookings; then Flipkart showed how to build a billion-dollar business by bringing modern retail to the computers (and mobiles) of consumers.
Most recently, the likes of Zomato, BookMyShow and Justdial have shown how the internet can be used to re-architect the food and beverage, events and local search spaces, respectively.
Now, a clutch of companies is looking to do the same with healthcare — specifically the chaotic and fragmented business for medical practitioners — and build the next big internet business out of India.
These companies, ranging in age from six years (like the sector's proverbial 800-pound gorilla Practo) to those that are barely a year old, are using the internet to aggregate and organize data on doctors, clinics, hospitals and other healthcare businesses, and provide a platform for consumers to access them.
Then, some of them are targeting the doctors themselves. They have jumped into the heart of a doctor's business — patient appointments, records and billings — to try to digitize what have been sheaves of paper.
In the past year and more, these companies have been gaining significant traction — market leader Practo to date has managed some 15 million records and booked 16.6 million appointments with 109,000 doctors across 351 towns and cities — even as investors, eager for their next big payout after e-commerce, begin to bite.
Investors Pop the Pill
The likes of Sequoia Capital and Nexus Venture are just a couple of venture capitalists that have backed firms in this space, even as others such as Matrix Partners weigh investments in this burgeoning market.
Avnish Bajaj was one of the early success stories of India's internet revolution — a startup called Bazee.com he cofounded was sold to eBay a decade ago for $55 million in 2004.
Now, he thinks the healthcare market could spawn India's next big internet smash hit. And, as the founder of Matrix Partners, an early-stage investor, he's keenly watching this space.
"India is mainly a cash economy for healthcare and people have a choice of which doctor to approach unlike the West, where you're forced to choose from a predetermined pool due to insurance restrictions," he says.
However, this choice is a doubleedged sword, since reaching these doctors isn't easy. Enter the online facilitators.
"These companies can solve a pressing consumer problem and in the process build a large and scalable internet company. Why can't the next Zomato be from the healthcare space?" wonders Bajaj. Entrepreneurs seem to agree.
"The use of technology in healthcare is limited, especially for a consumer," says Shashank ND, cofounder of Bangalore-based Practo. "Finding a doctor, booking an appointment and getting a bill and the overall experience at a clinic or hospital are, for a consumer, a poor experience."
  The chaos — a large market, multiple customer pain points and a lack of technology in healthcare — may be an ideal setting for the likes of Practo. "The use of technology can revolutionize customer experience in this industry," says Shashank.
His firm, he contends, has proven this business is viable. "Practo Ray, the practice management software, has become dominant in its field — 15% of doctors use some form of this software and 90% of them use our product," he claims.
Products such as Practo Ray have helped overhaul the perception of a doctor's business. Users can get printed — rather than illegibly-scrawled — prescriptions, appointment reminders are messaged to patients and invoices digitally stored. "We have upgraded the customer experience," he says.
Virtual Remedies
This is just the reason Hemanshu Mehta, a dentist with a clinic in Mumbai's Sion suburb, signed up with Practo. The clinic, which is usually packed through the week, needed a software package to manage patient appointments and records and help the doctor access them on the go. "Earlier, five out of 10 patients would give us excuses for not turning up," says Mehta between appointments.
"Now, they get a call and an automated text message reminder to keep them updated." Recently, the doctor has also begun to use Practo Hello, a virtual receptionist, to add another layer of technology to his operation. This tool, he adds, allows him to track the booking of appointments, access patient records and data — and reach out to them directly — while he is on the move. "Patient care has become much more manageable and flexible with these tools," he says.

(They are expanding their…)
BENGALURU: Foreign entrepreneurs in India are expanding their focus from social enterprise and non-profit industries to tap into the massive potential of the country's emerging consumer base, adapting proven solutions from elsewhere to this market in some cases and coming up with innovative products to cater to local demand in others.
Zoomcar, for instance, is an adaptation of American self-drive car rental service Zipcar. The company recently raised $8 million (about Rs 494 crore) from Sequoia Capital and counts prominent businesswoman Lady Barbara Judge as a dedicated repeat investor, among others.
"Until we launched, there was no such thing as organised self-drive car rentals here, so the potential is actually to be the Zipcar and Hertz (a major American car rental company) of India," said Zoomcar's American co-founder David Back. "Here, it's also about giving people an alternative to owning your car, so that in the long term there are fewer cars on Indian streets."
Perhaps the most-successful foreign-owned QSR (quick service restaurant) business to emerge recently is California Burrito, founded by three recent college graduates from the United States.
Taking inspiration from global chain Chipotle, they opened its first Mexican "fast casual" outlet two-years-ago and it is now the fastest-growing burrito chain in Asia. With seven outlets across Bengaluru currently, the team expects the chain to expand to a new city and hit 12 stores by the end of this financial year. The company has raised over $1 million (Rs 62 crore) in investments and their outlets typically break even within one month of launch.
"Incomes are rising a lot for the Indian consumer, and as their spending power expands, they are going to want the same things as anyone else," said co-founder Bert Mueller, 25, who had known his two other collaborators since elementary school. "India as a market is not one that a lot of people think of off the bat to start a business, and it's a challenging place to start a company. So if you can surmount the barrier, it gives you an advantage."
Adhvith Dhuddu , 28, founder of digital marketing agency AliveNow and a major investor in California Burrito, said it is one of his best investments.
"I was amazed that here are three people who are not natives of India, who were born and brought up in the US, and they have come here, learnt the system, studied the market, and successfully launched something profitable." Other entrepreneurs have come up with solutions that are unique to the Indian market.
Mobile marketing firm Zipdial is a prime example - its model using missed calls capitalises on a habit familiar to Indian masses and provides a win-win solution to consumers and advertisers alike. "There's a lot more opportunity to create disruptive businesses in a highgrowth, large market like this that is only becoming more important in the world," said American Valerie Wagoner, founder of Zipdial.

CHENNAI: Forget event managers or transport providers, the new service providers joining a vendors list are App developers . Aswin Ramasamy's Chennai-based startup ContractIQ has drawn up a huge vendor's list of software/app outsourcing.
Started in 2012, ContractIQ is a platform where developers from all over the world register and make themselves attractive for companies looking for Apps or other software service requirements.
Having served close to 130 customers via its database, which has over 10,000 developers from across the globe, the company is turning into a matchmaker of sorts. India has over 10,000 software developing companies, and with no information available about their credentials, save the top 50 companies, choosing becomes a complicated task for buyers.
This is where ContractIQ steps in and simplifies the task. As for developers, ContractIQ provides the power of a platform. Taking information from these developers and their previous customers, analysing it and making patterns out of it, ContractIQ comes up with the best choice for a customer with a particular set of requirements.
The requirement of every buyer is understood through a detailed questionnaire and interactions, following which suitable vendors are chosen. "Five percent of the market consists of absolutely good vendors and they remain the same in their skills despite their location," said Aswin.
Another 20% might be equally good at the skills but need to be told what to do. The database of ContractIQ ignores the remaining and thus eliminates 75% of the risks straight away. Their team, after putting a buyer and a bidder in a conversation, also joins them to ensure that both sides are transparent.
"We have done close to 130 transactions with 95% success, when the market average is just 50%," Aswin said, pointing out that the remaining 5% failed only because the customer (the company looking to buy a service) ran out of money.
ContractIQ assists buyers even after the deal is completed, thus systematically plugging wherever outsourcing could go wrong. "Lot of fortune 500-level methodologies, power of data is packed into a platform and given to the customer. Gartner or Forrester, for this kind of work, charge 200$ per hour which we do for free," Aswin said.
The startup's clients seem pleased. "We needed some high-end technology development organization for our new website," said Arun Athiappan, founder of Ticketgoose.

Development Commission
(PM Narendra Modi in…)
NEW DELHI: Work has moved into top gear for finalising the name and structure for the new institution that will replace the 64-year old Planning Commission and the same may be unveiled this December.
"The Prime Minister has convened a meeting of the Chief Ministers on December 7 to seek their view points on the structure of the institution which would ultimately replace the Planning Commission," an official source said.
The Commission has received many suggestions regarding the name and role of the new body. Some of the suggested names are Sustainable Development Commission, National Development Agency, Social Economic Development Commission or Bharat Pragati Lakshya. Besides, there have been reports about the new body being named as Niti Aayog or Policy Commission.
The new institution, which is likely to be headed by the Prime Minister as was the case in Planning Commission, may have four divisions-- Inter-state council, plan evaluation office, UIDAI and DBT. All the divisions would have experts from the Centre and state governments as also experts from the industry.
The Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) Mission earlier was part the Planning Commission but was moved to the Finance Ministry later.
According to sources, the new body could also be the secretariat for the inter-state council which is at present under the home ministry and met rarely during the UPA term. This council used to meet regularly during the previous NDA regime.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his Independence Day speech had announced that the Commission would be abolished and replaced with a more relevant institution.
Since then the Commission has held several meetings with experts to discuss the new structure of the proposed institution.
Country's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had set up the Planning Commission to steer the nation's economic destiny at that time.
Set up by a Cabinet Resolution, the Commission has enjoyed power and prestige with Prime Minister as its Chairman. Its most important functions have been fixing targets for sectoral growth and allocate resources.
The Deputy Chairman of the Commission has often been a political stalwart holding the rank of a Cabinet Minister.
Gulzarilal Nanda, V T Krishnamachari, C Subramaniam, P N Haksar, Manmohan Singh, Pranab Mukherjee , K C Pant, Jaswant Singh, Madhu Dandavate, Mohan Dharia and R K Hegde had been deputy chaiman at differnt points of time.
Montek Singh Ahluwalia was the last deputy chairman.

Modi must not create rules that cannot be enforcedWhy Prime Minister Narendra Modi must not create rules that cannot be enforced
By Swaminathan S Anklesaria Aiyar, TNN | 30 Nov, 2014, 11.06AM IST
For every new rule, Modi must abolish 10 old ones, opening up administrative space. Good governance means fewer but critical rules, well enforced.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
In his election campaign, Narendra Modi said that for every new law we should abolish 10 old ones. This admirable sentiment expressed a golden rule of good governance — create a minimum of sensible laws and enforce them fully. Don't create a pleth ora of laws that overwhelm administrative capacity and remain unimplemented.
Alas, this principle is not being followed today. Consider the new anti-smoking regulations. The government proposes to ban the sale of loose cigarettes and raise the age of those who can buy cigarettes. But loose cigarettes account for 75% of all sales, at maybe a million outlets.Will the government appoint an army of inspectors to check loose sales by every cigarette vendor? Will another army check the age of every person buying cigarettes?
The administration is unable to check murders, rapes, thefts, or criminalized politics and business. Judicial delays are endless. Should we divert scarce administrators, police and courts from the most urgent tasks to loose cigarette sales? Massive vacancies have arisen in the courts, police and adminstration because state governments lack cash. That must be set right before forcing new responsibilities on staff already collapsing under existing obligations. Health is important. Smoking causes cancer. Yet there is no proposal to apply tough anti-smoking rules to beedis, which are just as cancerous as cigarettes.Treating beedis on par with cigarettes will curb smoking much faster than additional curbs on cigarettes. When we all know that, yet action does not follow, it's clear the government is motivated more by political considerations (like maintaining employment in the beedi industry) than reducing deaths from smoking.
The same politicians that passionately denounce cigarettes happily provide irrigation and fertilizer subsidies to farmers growing tobacco! But let us not get diverted to hypocrisy: let us keep our focus on the folly of constantly creating new rules that, even if desirable, cannot be implemented. A plethora of rules leads only to mass evasion, corruption and cynicism. Rules that people will not observe and the administration cannot implement simply criminalize the whole population.
Delhi's pollution is terrible. So, the National Green Tribunal has come out with several new rules. Alas, though well-intentioned, some will create new distortions and others are unimplementable. For instance, the tribunal has banned all vehicles older than 15 years in Delhi. Restricting the ban to Delhi makes no sense: pollution is a problem in all big cities. Besides, such bans have failed elsewhere: a ban in Mexico City induced suburban folk to bring in old vehicles registered outside the city, and these were sometimes more polluting than those phased out in the city .
The tribunal wants to criminalize the burning of leaves, wood, plastics and other items that add to pollution. But in winter every chowkidar lights such fires to keep warm. Slums in every city burn large quantities of dung and firewood for cooking. This worsens pollution, yet jailing all poor people who use such fuels would be cruel even if it was implementable. Priorities, please.

Caste continues to matter a great deal in IndiaWhy caste continues to matter a great deal in India
By Santosh Desai, TNN | 30 Nov, 2014, 10.53AM IST
 It is easy to see why there is such great sensitivity to the casual mention of caste -it has after all been the most significant axis of discrimination in the country.

There is a large section of India where caste continues to matter a great deal; indeed caste can sometimes become a matter of life and death. But there is another India, albeit a small one, where caste or at least any reference to it is difficult to find. For people living in this little alcove, caste is an anachronism that belongs elsewhere, both in terms of space and time, and has no role to play in everyday life. As the controversy around Rajdeep Sardesai's tweet congratulating fellow members of the GSB ( Goud Saraswat Brahmin ) community on their achievements suggests, any mention of caste is politically fraught.
The attitude towards caste is a peculiarly schizophrenic one. In one part of India, it is seen to colour everything, while in another it appears nowhere in any public discourse, except as a description of the other. When it does surface in a personal context as in Sardesai's case, it evokes outrage. It is easy to see why there is such great sensitivity to the casual mention of caste -it has after all been the most significant axis of discrimination in the country. But is any mention of it an automatic act of promoting discrimination and hatred?
There is no question that caste continues to play a role even in the part of India that thinks that it has moved beyond it. It does so in overt ways, like the caste mentions that we see in matrimonial ads. It does so in more implicit ways -a clear caste pattern can be seen in the surnames of CFOs in corporations across the country . It manifests itself more structurally in a comfort with hierarchies of an embedded kind -take the way in which domestic help is treated in this country , not as employees but virtually as a different category of human beings.The importance accorded to seniority in the government is another caste-like structure in that conceptually , 'birth' determines the future for all times to come. This is true even of the products of the IIMs where 'batch parity' continues to be of great importance. In a general sense, not only are hierarchies revered, but there is an attempt to make them permanent. Once a VIP , always a VIP .

Why you don t need to learn Sanskrit to get to know Indian cultureWhy you don't need to learn Sanskrit to get to know Indian culture

We shouldn't make Sanskrit, or Sanskrit culture and literature, the modern equivalent of daal chawal. It should never be commonplace. We need to keep it special. Keep it rare.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
No matter how much you love it, you can't eat daal chawal every day. Or any food for that matter. How does the saying go? Ghar ki murgi daal barabar. Anything that becomes commonplace loses its charm.
That's why you don't need to learn Sanskrit to get to know your culture. In fact, don't take this personally, but you may actually be better off not being taught your culture at all. Not in Sanskrit or in any language. Sometimes the best way to learn something is not to study it.
Our favourite books are the ones we stumble over, accidentally on a rainy afternoon when bored out of our skulls. The ones that we swore we wouldn't touch when someone (an elder someone, most likely) told us we must read it. Our most beloved songs are songs we came across on our own and fell in love with, not the anthems we are compelled to stand up and chant twice a day. The places we have never been are always the destinations we save up hard-earned money to visit -not the places we live in and work in everyday.
Imagine spending every holiday wandering around our own homes! Imagine listening only to our anthem, played endlessly on a loop. Reading the same text over and over endlessly . Well, that's exactly what people in religious orders do - all their lives.
It's great if that's what you're looking to be: a monk, a priest, a nun, a sadhu or sadhini.
That which we seek on our own owns us. It's what we live for. To discover, to experience the new, to turn a corner and come face to face with the unexpected. It's why we travel, seek out new experiences, meet new people, books, food, jobs, music, movies, life.
We shouldn't make Sanskrit, or Sanskrit culture and literature, the modern equivalent of daal chawal. It should never be commonplace. We need to keep it special. Keep it rare. A precious secret to be discovered on one's own, almost accidentally . That's what happened to me. I grew up in a Christian Anglo-Indian family . The Bible was the only religious text in the house. Church is where we all went to pray. Nobody forced me to study Sanskrit. I was free to read any darn thing I desired. While other kids were home watching Ramayana or Mahabharata, I was out watching Star Wars. When the good kids were reading Amar Chitra Katha I was reading Stephen King . When they were chanting along to kirtans, I was rocking Deep Purple , Pink Floyd and everything from soul funk to gangster rap.

Yes, a dewy face is officially a celebrity trend: Go natural like Kareena Kapoor Khan with nude lips, or play femme fatale like Deepika Padukone with a bold red pout. Walk out with a feminine flare by adding a rosy blush like Katrina Kaif or channel a beach goddess by bronzing up that shine a la Kangana Ranaut.

This is the seventh reduction in petrol price since August and the third since October in the case of diesel.
The price of petrol has been cut by 91 paise a litre and of diesel by 84 paise on declining international oil prices. This is the seventh reduction in petrol price since August and the third since October in the case of diesel.
The new prices are effective from Sunday midnight, Indian Oil Corporation said in a statement.
“Since the last price changes, the international prices of both petrol and diesel have continued to be on a downtrend,” the company said. “The rupee-dollar exchange rate has, however, appreciated since the last price change. The combined impact of both these factors warrants a decrease in retail selling prices of both petrol and diesel.”
The petrol and diesel prices were previously reduced on November 1 by Rs. 2.41 and Rs. 2.25 a litre, respectively. Post-reduction, petrol will cost Rs. 63.33 in Delhi; Rs. 70.73 in Kolkata; Rs. 70.95 in Mumbai; and Rs. 66.05 in Chennai. Diesel will cost Rs. 52.51 in Delhi; Rs. 57.08 in Kolkata; Rs. 60.11 in Mumbai; and Rs. 55.93 in Chennai.

FCI has Rs 10 000 crore of phantom rice stocksTata Steel close to reopening its top iron ore mine
Thanks to its granaries overflowing, Food Corporation of India’s (FCI) is unable to keep tabs on foodstocks it is supposed to have. At the last count, over R10,000 crore of FCI’s rice stocks were missing. While the paddy had been procured and was supposed to have been given to the millers, close to 6 million tonnes (mt) of stock is yet to come back to the FCI storehouses. The food ministry has given FCI till the end of next month to retrieve these. The value of R10,000 crore is based on that year’s procurement price and does not include the cost of purchasing and other expenses.
FCI is holding roughly two-and-a-half times the amount of wheat and rice it needs; it has 30.1 mt of wheat stock as compared to the October 1 buffer of 14 mt  and 23.1 mt of rice as compared to the buffer of 7.2 mt.
Compared to FCI’s procurement, the amount is quite large — 11.2% in 2012-13 and 6.8% in 2013-14. But in terms of the stock FCI is showing on its books — 23.1 mt of rice versus the buffer norm of 7.2 mt — the missing rice adds up to a whopping 26%. “We can understand the delay of a few months in milling, but if the rice is not received after more than a year of paddy procurement, it raises doubts as to whether the state governments even procured that much rice,” a senior official said.
Under what has been proposed, if the outstanding stocks are not realised by the end of next month, this will be written off at the expense of the state governments. The largest chunk of the missing rice comes from states like Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha.
In 1997-98, the states where FCI was not procuring rice were allowed to procure from farmers on behalf of FCI. Once these states met the requirement of their ration shops, the surplus was supposed to be deposited with FCI in its central pool.
In 2012-13, 10.86 mt of rice (in terms of paddy equivalent) was procured from these four states, and 3.82 mt of that remains with the millers.
In 2013-14, 9.37 mt was procured in these states, and of this, 2.15 mt has not been returned to FCI.

American Tower Corp set to pick up 51% in tower company Viom for $1 billion
Arijit Barman & Anandita Singh Mankotia, ET Bureau Dec 1, 2014, 04.00AM IST

(Viom’s enterprise valuation…)
NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: American Tower Corp (ATC) is close to sealing a deal worth $900 million-$1 billion to acquire a 51% stake in Viom Networks, which will be followed by a merger of the Indian unit of ATC with Viom, bringing the curtains down on year-long talks.
Viom is majority-owned by the Tatas (54%), who hold the stake through unlisted telecom arm Tata Teleservices.
Srei, promoted by the Kolkata-based Kanoria family, owns around 18.5% while the rest is held by a clutch of PE funds including IDFC Private Equity, SBI Macquarie, Oman Investment Fund, GIC of Singapore and AMP Capital.
According to multiple sources involved in the transaction, the first leg of the deal will see Srei sell its stake and exit Viom, while the Tatas will significantly pare their shareholding to 26-30%.
"While Macquarie, SBI and IDFC Private Equity will continue for certain, the decision of the other equity firms is not yet clear," said one of the people cited, referring to the first stage of the transaction.
The second phase of this twopronged process will see ATC merging its India portfolio of around 12,000 towers with Viom, which owns 42,000 towers, marking a substantial consolidation in the local telecom towers industry.
ATC will be the controlling shareholder of the merged entity, though the exact shareholding depends on the outcome of lastmile negotiations.
Viom's enterprise valuation is around Rs 18,000-19,000 crore, which includes over a billion dollars (Rs 6,500 crore) of debt.
ATC and Macquarie declined comment while the rest didn't respond to queries. One of the people quoted earlier told ET the agreement is almost final though some changes were possible.
Post merger, Tatas and remaining PE holders will get a stake in the combined entity, though their holdings will be diluted.
"In future, ATC would like to raise capital through an IPO of the combined ATC-Viom and that is when Tata Teleservices will look at a complete exit," said one the persons privy to the details of the deal, explaining why the Tatas have chosen to dilute their stake and not exit completely.
"The Tatas expect the valuations of their tower portfolio to rise under ATC's management."
Credit Suisse and Citi are the bankers to the deal.
Once signed, the deal will bring to an end over a year of protracted negotiations during which Viom's founders were also simultaneously looking at alternative means of raising funds, such as through local or an overseas listing, given the buoyancy in the stock markets.
With other suitors — which at one time included PE firms Carlyle, Providence and Malaysian telecom company Axiata, which has a significant stake in Idea Cellular — dropping out, ATC's bid remained the largest and the only formal offer.
Founded in 2009, Viom posted a profit of Rs 100 crore on revenues of Rs 4,900 crore for the year ended March 31, 2014. It recorded an operating margin of 56%. The company claims a tenancy ratio of 2.2 times and over 92,000 tenancies.
The firm trails Indus Towers, a venture promoted by the Bharti Group, Vodafone India and Aditya Birla Telecom, in India's telecom tower market, which is seeing a revival in tandem with the overall telecom sector. Indus operates some 1.1 lakh towers.
Viom gets more than 40% of its revenue from Tata Teleservices, 20% from Uninor and remaining from other operators. It has a master-level agreement to lease towers to Reliance Jio Infocomm at a market-determined price. The ATC deal would help the Tata Group pare some of the Rs28,000-crore debt of its telecom business. The funds can also be partly used to pay NTT DoCoMo for the Japanese company's stake in Tata Teleservices. The Tata Group is reportedly looking to exit the telecom sector.
Srei will use the cash for its other businesses, which include infrastructure development, and finance.
Nasdaq-listed ATC, on the other hand, has a comparatively smaller presence in the country, operating about 12,000 towers.
Last year, the company was looking to reduce its tower count as the telecom industry was going through a tough phase post the 2012 licence cancellations and the lack of investment by debt-ridden telcos.
But the US company has renewed its focus on India, with pricing power now returning to operators and the industry seeing massive growth of wireless data traffic. The successful spectrum auctions in February this year and another upcoming sale next February have also raised expectations of a spurt in tower demand as telecom operators are likely to aggressively roll out data services, which will require a large number of tower sites.

In an audacious attack two days ahead of polls, militants on Sunday night shot dead sarpanch of the ruling National Conference in Shopian district of Kashmir near his residence.
Mohammad Sultan Bhat was in his car when, about 500 metres from his residence in Nazneenpora in Shopian when the ultras stopped his vehicle and pumped bullets at him from close range at around 9.30 pm, police said.
The killing has come just two days ahead of the phase two polls in north and south Kashmir.
Bhat died on the spot while the assailants managed to escape, it said. Extending condolences to the sarpanch's family, Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah said Bhat's death "will only spur us on to remain steadfast and committed to our mission of a peaceful, prosperous new Jammu & Kashmir."
"He joins the many hundreds of NC cadre killed for their political beliefs," Omar tweeted.

With tax incentives  pension funds can be on a par with EPFO productsTax implications of second home: Various scenarios
The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) is getting ready to bring in a host of regulatory measures in the next two months. New PFRDA Chairman Hemant Contractor, who was till recently MD of State Bank of India, spoke to George Mathew about a host issues from tax sops, fee structure to new plans in an interview. Excerpts:
What is your agenda for the pension sector?
The Act was passed last year and was notified in February this year. We are now putting in place all regulations to make the Act effective. We have to finalise 14 or 15 regulations in the next two months. That’s our immediate priority. Otherwise you can’t make the Act effective. The role of various stakeholders, aggregators, the role of trustees, record keeping agencies and custodians…all these things are getting finalised. The pushing of pension products, especially under Jan Dhan, is also a focus area.
Is the pension fund market growing?
The organised sector is fairly well covered. The EPFO covers all organised companies, the government and all civil servants are covered. What remains is the unorganised sector. This segment include hawkers, drivers, maidservants, rickshaw-wallahs. It’s not very easy to cover. That’s one we are now targetting. This is the bottom of pyramid and it’s not an easy job. We have been growing well. In the NPS Lite, which is the low-cost pension product, the numbers have touched 35 lakh. Last year we doubled the number. This year our plan is to grow by 50 lakh. Out of the fund size of Rs 70,000 crore, nearly 80 per cent is government money. The subscriber base will grow. These subscribers are small players and they hardly pay Rs 1,000 or Rs 2,000.
Are returns matching expectations? Will you hike equity investment limit?
On the returns front, we are on a par with all the private sector fellows. This is because the investment pattern has been made like that. You can go up to 50 per cent in equity. We have the lowest cost pension product. With just Rs 50, you can have a pension product. On hiking equity limit, subscribers are not very keen. They have gone up to only 15-16 per cent in equity though theoretically they can go up to 50 per cent.
Will you get a level playing field on the tax front vis-a-vis EPFO?
We have been asking for tax incentives so that we can be on par with EPFO products. Right now it’s EET (no tax during contribution and accumulation but taxed during withdrawal) pension and we want to make it EEE (no tax at any of the stages). The government said we will look at it. When the tax issue is sorted out, there will be lot more interest.
Is there any plan to bring EPFO under PFRDA or allow more players?
No. EPFO is kept out of our purview. The Act also says that. Right now there are seven pension fund managers in operation. We reviewed the position only in January this year. There’s no immediate plan to review the system.
Are you able to bring corporates under your pension plan?
We have got around 1,500 corporates. The fund size is just about Rs 1,300 crore. We would like that sector to grow. There is lack of awareness which is an issue. This product, NPS, is not very well known. Our attempt is to popularise it among corporates.
There is a complaint from pension players that they are not getting enough remuneration? Do you plan to revise the fee?
It was an open bidding process. They have themselves to blame. They keep saying you have to revise the fee. There’s no immediate plan to do it. We will be looking at it. We don’t think it’s low. If they start losing interest in the industry, that’s also not good for the industry. We would like to have a balanced view of things. Our first priority is to put in place all regulations so that everybody understands their responsibilities. When that’s done, we will look at other things.
What will be the impact of the Insurance Bill on pension sector? Will more foreign players come into the sector?
It will be automatically applicable in the pension fund sector. Not many (foreign players) have come. I don’t know how much foreign interest it will attract. When it was 26 per cent, there was not much activity. At 49 per cent, maybe some players might come in. But the thing to note is that the market to be tapped is the unorganised market. This market is big, but may not be immediately attractive to foreign players. They will probably come in when the market grows a little bit.

Haryana sisters thrash molesters in moving bus  passengers look onHaryana sisters who beat up molesters to be felicitated by CM

The brave college-going sisters, who fought back eve-teasers in a Haryana Roadways bus, will be honoured by Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Republic day.
In a rare show of courage, the two sisters thrashed three molestors inside a bus in Haryana's Rohtak town, even as passengers chose to look the other way.
Both sisters confronted the accused and mustered enough courage to thrash them, with one of the girls even hitting the youths with her belt, for allegedly outraging their modesty.
The entire incident, recorded by a passenger on mobile phone, went viral both on television and social media. It showed the two girls using their hands and a belt to thrash the molestors, who appeared to be taken by surprise.
A case has been registered against three youths in this connection, police said on Sunday. No arrest has, however, been made so far.
The accused have been identified as Kuldeep, Mohit and Deepak, police said, adding that a case under section 354 (assault or criminal force with intent to outrage woman's modesty) and section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of IPC have been registered against them.
The victims in their complaint alleged that they were harassed by some youths in a Haryana Roadways bus when they were going to their college on Friday.
When the victims objected, one of the accused started beating them up.
Not to give up easily, the girls fought with the accused as fellow passengers remained mute spectators. One of the victims even hit the accused with a belt, police said.
One of the girls said, "They threatened us and abused us. One of them touched my sister inappropriately. They started making obscene gestures... After heated exchanges, one of the boys called his friends asking him to beat us up. One of them beat my sister while two others caught hold of me.
"Then, I whipped out my belt and thrashed them. They pushed us out of the bus when it slowed down," she narrated.
Meanwhile, the father of the two sisters alleged that there was pressure from the panchayat that the girls should withdraw the complaint.
SP Rohtak Shanshank Anand told PTI over phone, "We have identified the accused and soon they will be arrested. These are brave girls and we fully support them."

HONG KONG, Dec 1:  
Thousands of pro-democracy activists forced the temporary closure of the Hong Kong government's headquarters on Monday after they clashed with police outside, defying orders to retreat after more than two months of sustained protests.
Chaos erupted as commuters made their way to work, with hundreds of protesters surrounding Admiralty Centre, which houses offices and retail outlets, in a tense stand-off with police. The central government offices and the legislature were forced to close in the morning, as were scores of shops.
Underscores frustration
The latest flare-up, during which police charged protesters with batons and pepper spray, marked an escalation in the civil disobedience movement. It also underscored the frustration of protesters at Beijing's refusal to budge on electoral reforms and grant greater democracy to the former British colony.
"The atmosphere in Admiralty is very different now after the clashes last night," said Jessica Lam, 20, who returned to the protest site on Monday morning. "It has become very tense, like back to the early days when the protest just started."
The democracy movement represents one of the biggest threats for China's Communist Party leadership since Beijing's bloody 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy student protests in and around Tiananmen Square.
Hundreds of riot police scattered the crowds in several rounds of heated clashes overnight, forcing protesters back with pepper spray and batons as some tried to scramble over walls in a crush of bodies on a highway outside government headquarters.
Police defend use of force
Scores of volunteer medics attended to numerous injured, some who lay unconscious and others with blood streaming from head gashes. Police said at least 40 arrests were made.
Hong Kong's security secretary Lai Tung-kwok defended the use of force: "The police have to take resolute actions, they have no choice ... it is their duty to restore law and order."
As police tackled the running battles in Admiralty, tensions escalated across the harbour in the gritty working-class district of Mong Kok, which had been the scene of violent clashes in recent weeks before the clearance of a large protest encampment from a major road there last Wednesday.
The protesters are demanding free elections for the city's next leader in 2017 rather than the vote between pre-screened candidates that Beijing has said it would allow.
Universal suffrage
The clashes came after student leaders called on activists to escalate their protests and surround government headquarters, galvanising supporters to make their way to the buildings in Admiralty, next to Hong Kong's central business district and some of the world's most expensive real estate.
Student representative Nathan Law urged protesters to continue the disobedience movement that began in late September, calling it a "long journey".
Despite several waves of clampdowns, crowds of protesters, many in protective goggles and body armour, refused to leave the area and continued to press against police lines, chanting "We want universal suffrage!". They threw bottles, helmets and umbrellas at police as tensions simmered into mid-morning.
Scores of demonstrators held up umbrellas, which have become a symbol of the pro-democracy movement, to protect themselves from the pepper spray and batons.
The latest clashes highlight the challenges authorities face as a restive younger generation contests Beijing's grip on the financial hub and demands greater democracy.
The Hong Kong rallies drew more than 100,000 on to the streets at their peak. Numbers have since dwindled and public support for the movement has waned.

Starlet Gauahar Khan slapped during reality show shootBy: Entertainment Feature Service | New Delhi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 9:46 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 5:24 pm
The self appointed moral police does it yet again! Model – actor Gauahar Khan was slapped by one of the audience members while she was hosting the singing reality show ‘India’s Raw Star’ at Film City in suburban Goregaon, Mumbai.
Gauahar Khan was attacked and threatened by an audience member who said that, “being a Muslim woman, she should not have worn such a short dress”, Aarey Colony police said. The accused, identified as Mohammed Akil Mallick (24), slapped and touched her inappropriately during the break of the show, but was immediately overpowered by the security guards deployed there, following which the police were notified.
Gauahar was as expected appalled at the slap and demanded the accused to be ousted. After the incident, she even refused shooting for the rest of the show, but the makers of the show convinced her to continue. Have a look at her reaction at the slap:
Senior inspector at Aarey police station, Vilas Chavan, said that the accused was subsequently arrested and booked under IPC sections 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation). Mallick will be produced before the court tomorrow.

Samsung Elec mobile chief JK Shin survives r...Samsung Electronics retains mobile chief JK Shin despite falling profits

(A company spokeswoman said…)
SEOUL: Samsung Electronics defied speculation it would drop the head of its underperforming mobile division, as the Samsung Group's heir apparent opted to keep the man his ailing father appointed while the patriarch's future is uncertain.
Staff at Samsung have been waiting nervously for the annual reshuffle after a weak smartphone performance and the worst earnings in three years, with many fearing for their jobs, but embattled co-chief executive J.K. Shin now knows he will continue to head the Electronics unit's mobile division despite sagging smartphone sales.
Semiconductor business chief Kwon Oh-hyun and consumer electronics head Yoon Boo-keun also kept their jobs.
Analysts said Jay Y. Lee, likely successor and only son of group patriarch Lee Kun-hee, opted to keep his father's key lieutenants in place to ensure stability and consolidate his own position.
"With Samsung undergoing major changes in the midst of the succession process, like selling affiliates and listing units, it would have been too unsettling to change leadership," said Chung Sun-sup, head of local research firm Chaebul.com.
"And without a signal that Chairman Lee Kun-hee has stepped back for good, it might have been too much for Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee to change the people his father put in position."
Park Ju-gun, head of corporate watchdog CEO Score, said Lee junior likely needs more time to shore up his position in South Korea's largest conglomerate with his father still in hospital after a heart attack in May.
"It was too soon for him to take a big risk at this point," Park said.
Samsung Group Senior Vice President Lee June reminded reporters that Shin was "a major contributor in Samsung Electronics' emergence as the top global player in the handsets business" and would be given an opportunity to turn the business around.
Squeezed by Chinese rivals like Xiaomi Technology Co Ltd
at the low end and Apple Inc's iPhones at the top, Samsung Electronics' share of the smartphone market has shrunk year-on-year for the last three quarters, leading to speculation Shin's days were numbered.
Samsung Electronics insiders said employees' focus was now on any follow-up management appointments and reorganisation plans due for the firm later this week.

India considering diesel exports to BangladeshIndia offers Bangladesh energy in return for transshipment facility
Our Bureau
Dhaka is keen that Delhi supplies 100 MW from OTPC to Bangladesh
Kolkata, Dec 1:  
Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said that India is ready to meet the energy needs of Bangladesh.
India is gearing up to enter into major economic cooperation with Bangladesh. On the cards are energy deals to double cross-border electricity sales and laying pipeline to export diesel to Bangladesh. In return, India expects Dhaka to extend transshipment facilities through Ashuganj river port and Chittagong sea port in Bangladesh.
Energy needs
“India is ready to meet Bangladesh’s energy needs,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday at a ceremony to announce completion of the 727 MW gas-based OTPC power station at Palatana in Tripura.
“If Bangladesh wants electricity (from India), India is ready to sell electricity to Bangladesh,” the Prime Minister said. He was responding to a request from Taufiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, energy advisor to Bangladesh Prime Minister Seikh Hasina, for additional 600 MW supplies. Chowdhury was present at today’s programme.
Bangladesh currently purchases 500 MW electricity through Bheramara border in West Bengal. This includes 250 MW supplied from the Central allocations at regulated domestic tariff.
Dhaka procures an additional 250 MW from India through open market deals. The average tariff is Taka 6 a unit, slightly lower than the weighted average of Taka 6.50 a unit in Bangladesh.
“We want to buy an additional 500 MW electricity from the Indian open market through the Bheramara border,” Chowdhury told Business Line.
Dhaka is keen that Delhi should supply 100 MW from OTPC to Bangladesh, in appreciation of its facilitating implementation of the project. Both the countries are currently conducting feasibility studies including investment requirements. A Petroleum Ministry official told media persons that a feasibility study is on for laying a 200 km pipeline connecting Numaligarh refinery in Assam to Parbatipur in Bangladesh for supply of one million tonnes of diesel a year.
Natural resources
While Modi was there to fulfil a Bangladeshi wish list, Tripura Chief Minister Manik Sarkar reminded the Prime Minister that it is time he should convince Seikh Hasina to grant access to tranship goods through Ashuganj and Chittagong ports. According to a senior minister of Tripura, the issue was further stressed at a meeting between the Prime Minister and the State cabinet.
Despite having rich natural resources, the land-locked nature of Tripura is now coming in its way to attract industries. Access to port facilities can convert it into a manufacturing hub.

Rupee falls to fresh 9-month low in early tradeForex update: Rupee recovers from over 9-month low, ends at 62.02 against US dollar
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: December 1, 2014  | 18:41 IST
(Photo: Reuters)
The rupee on Monday recovered from initial losses and edged marginally higher at 62.02 against the Greenback, snapping a two-day losing trend, on late dollar selling by exporters and some banks.
After opening weak, the rupee hit a fresh nine-month low of 62.25 against US currency as traders reacted to government easing curbs on gold imports and economic growth for second quarter coming at a tepid 5.3 per cent. However, the local unit erased the losses and closed marginally higher by one paisa.
At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market, the rupee commenced sharply lower at an intra-day low of 62.25 a dollar from Friday's close of 62.03 .
The mood was a bit cautious ahead of Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) monetary policy review .
"Over this week, we expect the pair to trade within a range of 61.60/80 and 62.30/40 levels on spot. RBI monetary policy and US November jobs report will be key data points," said Anindya Banerjee, Currency Analyst, Kotak Securities.
Later, the rupee rebounded on dollar selling by some banks and exporters and ended at an intra-day high of 62.02 against the American unit, up 0.02 per cent.
In the previous two sessions, the rupee had lost 19 paise.
The domestic currency had little help from the domestic stock market on Monday as the benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) index Sensex closed 134.37 points (or 0.47 per cent) lower.
There was support for the rupee from data released by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) that showed FPIs/FIIs infused US $396.24 million in the domestic market on Friday.
The dollar index, a gauge of six major global rivals, was down by 0.15 per cent. Oil prices fell to a five-year low and even gold rates fell as global investors were risk-averse.
Pramit Brahmbhatt, CEO, Veracity Group said, the trading range for the spot rupee is expected to be within 61.60 to 62.40.
In the forward market, premia closed steady to weak on stray receipts from exporters.
The benchmark six-month premium payable in May ended at its last Friday's closing level of 224-226 paise while forward contracts maturing in November, 2015, softened to 433.5-435.5 paise from 435-437 paise.
The RBI fixed the reference rate for dollar at 62.1377 and for the Euro at 77.3677.
The rupee fell back against the pound to 97.48 from Friday's close of 97.34 while it moved down further to 77.31 per euro from 77.29.
The domestic unit, however, improved further to 52.36 per 100 Japanese yen from 52.48 last Friday.

Gauahar Khan  slapped  for wearing  skimpy  dress on sets of reality showActor Gauahar Khan slapped for wearing short skirt on reality show
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  Mumbai, December 01, 2014

Actor and model Gauahar Khan was allegedly slapped by a 24-year-old youth who was in the audience of a singing show hosted by her at Film City, Goregaon (East), on Sunday. The Aarey Sub police have detained the suspect, Akil Malik. Police sources said the accused told them he disapproved of the actor wearing a short skirt.

According to the police, the incident took place during the final episode of India's Raw Star at studio number 9. “A preliminary probe has revealed that someone from the audience started teasing Khan to which she protested. An argument ensued between Gauahar and the man who was teasing her. Things turned ugly when the man suddenly slapped the actor,” an Aarey police officer said requesting anonymity.
India's Raw Star is an Indian singing competition series hosted by Khan and mentored by singer-rapper Yo Yo Honey Singh.
The brawl did not end there with one of the show’s finalists and one of the production men beating up the accused. Guards deployed at the venue intervened and caught the accused and handed him over to the police who later sent him for a medical examination.
A source from the show reveals, “There were over 2,500 people present at the venue with 250 bouncers. Yet a 24-year-old guy in the crowd teased Khan and got into an argument with her. While he was being escorted out of the place, he managed to go up on stage and slapped her.”
The source adds, “It was chaos after the security pulled the man away. Gauahar was shocked and was crying a lot. A stunned Gauahar didn’t understand what happened. Though the shooting was stopped, Gauahar took a break of an hour to gather her bearings and then reported back on stage to finish the leftover one hour shoot.”
“We will record Khan’s statement in detail and will register a case under section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 354 (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) of Indian Penal Code and will arrest the accused youth,” said Vilas Chavan, senior inspector of the Aarey Sub police station.

“While HUL's valuations are expensive relative to history, high valuations of other multi-national companies FMCG continue to be even more demanding. Further, we believe that ITC is likely to see stagnation in valuations on account of regulatory overhangs. On these counts, we think that HUL remains well-placed to see sustenance and perhaps, strengthening of re-rating that the stock has witnessed,” analyst said in a report dated October 28.

Pro-democracy protesters clashed with police Monday as they tried to surround Hong Kong government headquarters in an attempt to revitalize their flagging movement for democratic reforms after camping out on the city’s streets for more than two months.
Repeating scenes that have become familiar since the movement began in late September, protesters carrying umbrellas — which have become symbols of the pro-democracy movement — battled police armed with pepper spray, batons and riot shields.
After student leaders told a big crowd rallying Sunday evening at the main protest site outside government headquarters that they would escalate their campaign, hundreds of protesters pushed past police lines on the other side of the complex from the protest site. They blocked traffic on a main road, but were stopped by police barricades from going down a side road to Chief Executive Leung Chun-Ying’s office.

The protesters, many wearing surgical masks, hard hats and safety goggles and chanting, “I want true democracy,” said they wanted to occupy the road to prevent Leung and other government officials from getting to work in the morning.
At one point, police charged the crowd, aggressively pushing demonstrators back with pepper spray and batons, after some protesters started pelting them with water bottles and other objects. Police later fell back, letting demonstrators re-occupy the road. At dawn, police charged again and cleared the protesters from some areas around the government headquarters.
Police Senior Superintendent Tsui Wai-hung said 40 protesters had been arrested, adding that authorities would not let the road, a major thoroughfare, remain blocked.

Imran Khan threatens to shut down Pakistan by Dec16By: Press Trust of India | Islamabad |
Posted: December 1, 2014 10:38 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 3:52 pm
Pakistan’s opposition leader Imran Khan on Sunday threatened to “shut down” the entire country by December 16 if the Nawaz Sharif Government failed to initiate an impartial probe into the alleged rigging in 2013 general elections.
The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chief, in a rally here outside the Parliament, said that his protest will continue till the government initiate an inquiry into the “massive rigging” in last year’s general elections, which saw Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) win by a landslide.
“The ball is in your court, Nawaz Sharif — do your talks, do your investigations and solve the issue. We will close Pakistan down when December 16 comes, and what I do after that you will not be able to bear it…It has been 109 days and Naya Pakistan is waking up every day. We can all see it,” Khan was quoted as saying by Dawn.
“On Thursday (December 4), I will go to Lahore and shut it down. On December 8 I will shut down Faisalabad, on December 12 I will go to Karachi and shut it down. By December 16 I will shut down all of Pakistan if the poll inquiry is not initiated,” Khan said.
The cricketer-turned-politician has been holding protest-rallies in different cities to spread his movement, demanding a probe into the allegations of rigging the election.
Khan had launched his protest in mid-August, demanding Sharif’s ouster, but he later withdrew his main demand of the Prime Minister’s resignation ahead of the probe and offered the government to constitute a judicial commission comprising Supreme Court judges, ISI and Military Intelligence officials, to investigate the reported rigging.
December 16 is considered as a tragic day in the history of Pakistan as the country lost its eastern wing after a war with India when its army surrendered and Bangladesh emerged as an independent country.
The PTI leader said that if his demand for the impartial inquiry of the elections was not met, he would make the functioning of government “impossible”.
He alleged that the Nawaz Sahrif government is promoting corruption and politics of patronage.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister’s spokesman, Mussadik Malik said that it was “unfortunate” that Khan had threatened to “shut down” the country.
“What he want to achieve through it. I urge him to leave the politics of agitation and enter into a meaningful dialogue to achieve his objectives,” he said.
Minister for Railways Saad Rafiq said such announcements cannot be made by a patriotic person.
“Imran wants to spread anarchy and derail democracy in the disguise of bringing true democracy,” he said.

Bird flu under control in Kerala  1.80 lakh birdsculledWritten by Shaju Philip | Thiruvananthapuram |
Posted: December 1, 2014 10:25 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 2:25 pm
Kerala government said the avian influenza which had hit the duck-rearing Central Kerala’s Kuttanad region has been brought under control. So far, 1.80 lakh ducks have been culled and the operation would be wound up on Monday with culling of another batch of 50,000 poultry.
Health Minister V S Shivakumar said the virus which was identified as H5N1 has not hit humans so far. Six samples were collected from persons with symptoms of avian flu, but all of them were negative. However, the government has equipped the hospitals in Alappuzha to face the situation if humans were found affected with H5N1. The health department t has put under observation around 3 lakh persons and visited 80,000 households in the affected areas, said the minister.
Although duck deaths have been reports from many part of Central Kerala, tests showed they were not due to avian influenza. The government has decided to extent the financial assistance to the duck farmers who had lost their bird even before the avian influenza was confirmed.

Asia factories find demand lacking, in further blow to commodities

(While lower commodity prices…)
SYDNEY: Asia's factories appeared to have stepped down a gear last month as a glut of supply met a dearth of global demand, piling pressure on prices of manufactured goods and the commodities used to make them.
Oil sank to its lowest in over five years on Monday, with the industrial bellwether copper not far behind. The rout spread to gold and silver while the U.S. dollar cleared seven-year peaks on the Japanese yen.
Both U.S. crude and Brent have now fallen for five straight months, the longest losing streak since the 2008 financial crisis.
With domestic and export demand softening and production growth weak, many Asian manufacturers were more reluctant to stock up on raw materials, activity surveys on Monday.
While lower commodity prices are a boon to consumer spending power, they have damaging side effects in a world where official interest rates are already at historic lows in many countries.
Slowing inflation acts as an unwanted tightening of policy as it pushes up real interest rates, one reason China and Japan surprised with new stimulus measures in recent weeks.
It was clear in HSBC's survey of Chinese businesses which found input costs fell for a fourth straight month in November while its overall index of activity touched a six-month trough of 50.0.
China's official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was scarcely better, slipping to 50.3 in November from October's 50.8.
"Domestic demand expanded at a sluggish pace while new export order growth eased to a five-month low. Disinflationary pressures remain strong while the labour market weakened further," said Hongbin Qu, chief economist for China and co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC.
"We continue to expect further monetary and fiscal easing measures to offset downside risks to growth."
After saying for months that China does not need any big economic stimulus, the central bank wrong footed markets by lowering rates in late November.
China's troubles were felt broadly across the region, with South Korea reporting exports to the Asian giant fell for the first time in three months, while its measure of manufacturing activity stayed stuck in contractionary territory.
In Indonesia , the HSBC Markit PMI reached the unwelcome milestone of the lowest since the survey began in April 2011 at 48.0. That was down from 49.2 in October.
In Japan, the Markit/JMMA version of the PMI eased to 52.0 in November, from 52.4 the month before. The economy slipped into recession in the third quarter as the baleful impact of a hike in sales taxes lingered longer than anyone expected.
Still, the extent of the contraction may have been overstated, given figures out Monday showed business investment was stronger than thought.
India was a rare bright spot, as it has been for a few months now, with its PMI climbing to a 21-month high of 53.3 last month.
A host of European and U.S. surveys are yet to come on Monday. The euro zone measure is expected to be barely positive at 50.4, woefully short of the U.S. ISM which is forecast to come in at 58.0.
The European Central Bank releases its latest economic estimates this week when inflation is back at a five-year low, adding to the case for more aggressive stimulus in the bloc.

Oil slips below $68; HPCL gains 3% | Citi raises Sensex target to 33KBrent
SINGAPORE: Oil fell more than $2 a barrel to a five-year low in Asian trade on Monday, extending a steep sell-off after OPEC decided not to cut production last week, keeping markets well supplied.
Both U.S. crude and Brent have fallen for five straight months, oil's longest losing streak since the 2008 financial crisis.
"Just when the market was thinking that a 4-year low for crude oil was bad enough, we have hit a 5-year low after the OPEC meeting," Phillip Futures analysts said in a note.
U.S. crude tumbled to near $64, dragging Brent down below $70, after Saudi Arabia's oil minister told fellow OPEC members last week that they must combat the U.S. shale oil boom.
"They (OPEC) can get by at $60 a barrel, but that price would knock out a fair whack of the competition - much U.S. shale oil for example - as well as put investment in future capacity growth firmly on the back-burner," ANZ analysts said in a note.
"They're playing the long game, banking that others can't."
Brent hit a low of $67.82 a barrel, the lowest since October 2009, and was down $1.71 at $68.44 a barrel by 0733 GMT. U.S. crude fell $1.49 to $64.66 a barrel, after earlier slipping to an intraday low of $64.10, the lowest since July 2009.
Oil-producing countries from Iraq to Nigeria are revising their 2015 budgets to reflect lower prices.
Iran refrained from protesting against OPEC's decision to retain its production ceiling to maintain group solidarity, even though the move will not benefit all members, Iranian oil minister said in local media reports.
Slower than expected growth in China's manufacturing sector may add further downward pressure on oil. China's official Purchasing Managers' Index ( PMI ) slipped to 50.3 in November, a government study showed on Monday, lower than analysts' forecasts of 50.6.
"It's not too bad a miss, but probably won't help (oil) too much," Ric Spooner, chief analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney said.
"It's best not to try to pick bottoms at this stage."
Spooner said the next support levels for Brent are at $68 and $64 a barrel. If West Texas Intermediate crude futures fall below $63.90 a barrel, the next support level would be at $50, he said.

Mobile app brings district youth festival on one’s fingertips

A screenshot of the mobile app for the school youth festival.
The app will make available all details over a smart phone on a real-time basis.
The district youth festival known for putting participants and parents through the ordeal of having to scurry hither and thither to know results and one’s turn of performance is likely to receive an image makeover in the latest edition that got underway here on Saturday.
IT@School, a project of the Department of General Education to foster IT education in schools, has come out with an Android-based mobile phone application, ddeernakulam, that will make available details of everything from venues to participants and points table to winners over a smart phone on a real-time basis.
“The app, which was put through a trial run, has proved to be successful and can now be downloaded from the Google play store. This is the first time a mobile app is being used at a district youth festival,” Antony Joseph, IT@School district coordinator, told The Hindu.
Earlier, the code of the winner alone was announced while the rest of the participants had to wait for the officials to source the score sheet from each venue, search through it and then get the confirmation from the judges to declare the results.
This considerable delay in updating the data online has also been done away with this time round. IT@School volunteers will be deployed at each venue and keep on updating the data of the progress of each event. Information on participants who were on stage performing and the ones next in line would be made.
“This means that participants need not hang around the venue of their chosen items but can even remain at home and check the mobile app, which would give them a fair idea about when their performance would be due,” Mr. Antony said. Though being introduced at the youth festival, the app will continue to be in use long after the fest is over. “The app will be one-stop reference point for disseminating all information with regard to the deputy director of education, Ernakulam”, said Mr. Antony.

It has been 30 years  Bhopal gas victims cant wait any longer: Amnestyrelief and aid organisation
Charges governments with letting Carbide off the hook
Amnesty International on Sunday called for urgent steps to provide adequate compensation to the victims of the 1984 Bhopal gas tragedy and bring the Union Carbide and Dow Chemical to book.
“Thirty years is more than enough to wait. They can’t wait any longer… can’t wait for compensation, health care and clean water, can’t wait for clean-up, can’t wait for the perpetrators of corporate crimes to be brought to justice,” said Salil Shetty, global head of the organisation.
Addressing a press conference here, he noted that governments, both at the Centre and the State, had let the Union Carbide off the hook for the thousands of deaths and injuries caused by the gas leak by “wildly underestimating” the casualties. This must be rectified at the earliest. “The government has to urgently re-verify the data against health records and make the figures credible.”
Pollution audit
As the waste continues to remain dumped at the Carbide plant here, the Amnesty International Secretary General said the Centre should invite United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) to carry out an independent audit of the pollution and also carry out a proper study of health issues in the area and take urgent action.
Mr. Shetty regretted that not a single American employee who was on top of the chain of command had so far been brought to justice and said India should raise the matter with the U.S. government. “Its double standards are outrageous. If the same disaster had been caused by an Indian company on U.S. soil, there was no way it would have got away with it.’’
Referring to the manner in which the U.S. dealt with the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, he said President Barack Obama went after the company and secured over $20 billion as compensation for the affected. “The U.S. has to show that it treats all human lives as equal and that human rights are for all, whether you are a poor Muslim woman in Bhopal or a U.S. citizen in Louisiana.’’

Crude oil plunges by 4.3% on weak Asian cuesCrude oil plunges by 4.3% on weak Asian cues
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Dec 01, 2014 10:47 AM IST
Crude oil futures tumbled 4.28% to trade at Rs 4,030 per barrel as speculators indulged in reducing exposures after it fell to new multi-year lows in Asian trade.
At the Multi Commodity Exchange, crude oil for delivery in December fell sharply by Rs 180, or 4.28%, to Rs 4,030 per barrel in 3,183 lots.
Oil for January next delivery plunged by Rs 176, or 4.15%, to Rs 4,068 per barrel in a turnover of 229 lots.
Sentiment remained weak at futures trade as crude prices fell further in Asian trade to new multi-year lows, sparked by OPEC's decision to maintain crude output in an oversupplied market, analysts said.
The unabated price plunge comes after the 12-nation Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) opted Thursday to maintain its collective output ceiling at 30 million barrels per day, where it has stood for three years.
Meanwhile, West Texas Intermediate crude for January delivery dipped $1.55 to $64.60, its lowest intra-day level of since July 2009. Also, brent crude for January sank $1.84 to $68.31 a barrel, below the psychologically importer $70 level on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Jhumpa Lahiri in shortlist for DSC PrizeBy: Reuters |
Posted: November 28, 2014 2:57 pm | Updated: November 28, 2014 2:58 pm
Pulitzer Prize winning author Jhumpa Lahiri is one of five frontrunners for next year’s DSC Prize, one of South Asia’s biggest literary awards, according to the shortlist announced in London on Thursday.
The five writers on the 2015 shortlist are a step closer to winning the $50,000 awarded to the author of the best novel about South Asia published or translated into English.
Bestselling Afghan-born author Khaled Hosseini, whose latest novel “And the Mountains Echoed” had been long-listed along with nine others, did not make the cut.
Jhumpa Lahiri, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 2000, is the best known author on the DSC shortlist with her entry “The Lowland”, a tale of Indian brothers bound by tragedy. The novel was also shortlisted for the Man Booker prize last year.
Also in the running are Pakistani writer Kamila Shamsie and London-based Romesh Gunesekera, who was a finalist for the Booker prize two decades ago.
Rounding out the list are first-time novelist Bilal Tanweer from Pakistan and India’s Shamsur Rahman Faruqi, who is nominated for his novel which he translated from Urdu.
Keki Daruwalla, the chair of judges, described the selections as “moving, challenging, and thought-provoking.”
“There were moments of great beauty in the multiple narratives and the jury was impressed by the deep structure of each book and the way characters were developed,” Daruwalla said in a statement.
The jury selected the finalists from 75 novels submitted for the award, now in its fifth year. The winner will be announced at the annual literature festival in the Indian city of Jaipur in January.
The finalists are:
* Bilal Tanweer for “The Scatter Here is Too Great” (Vintage Books/Random House)
* Jhumpa Lahiri for “The Lowland” (Vintage Books/Random House)
* Kamila Shamsie for “A God in Every Stone” (Bloomsbury)
* Romesh Gunesekera for “Noontide Toll” (Hamish Hamilton/Penguin)
* Shamsur Rahman Faruqi for “The Mirror of Beauty” (Penguin Books)

Australia Out Of Step With New Climate MomentumAustralia Government Out Of Step With New Climate Momentum

reddit
CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who rose to power in large part by opposing a tax on greenhouse gas emissions, is finding his country isolated like never before on climate change as the U.S., China and other nations signal new momentum for action.
Abbott tried and failed to keep the issue off the agenda of the annual G-20 summit of wealthy and emerging countries that was hosted by the Australian city of Brisbane in mid-November. An agreement between Washington and Beijing to curb emissions, announced days before the summit, suggests he had misjudged the international mood on the issue.
Next week, attention turns to the next round of international climate change negotiations in Lima, Peru. For a nation of just 23 million, Australia has played a significant role in past talks, but this time it's unclear what kind of role its delegation, led by Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, will play.
Abbott's conservative coalition won a landslide election victory last year over the Labor Party, which had grown unpopular in part because it had approved one of the world's highest taxes on major carbon gas polluters. Abbott not only ended that tax but years earlier helped scuttle an effort by his own Liberal Party to reach a bipartisan deal on a carbon-trading scheme, intended to encourage industries to produce less emissions.
G-20 heavyweights including the United States and Europe steamrolled Australia's efforts as summit host to keep climate change off the agenda in Brisbane. In the end, the G-20 agreed to work together toward a global agreement on reducing carbon gas emissions at a major U.N. climate change conference in Paris in September 2015. The Lima meeting is the final high-level ministerial summit in which countries will aim to work toward a draft agreement to be presented in Paris.
A European Union official described getting Australia to agree to the wording of a paragraph on climate change in the G-20 summit communique as slow-moving "trench warfare." In arguing for keeping climate change off the G-20 agenda, Australia said it was not strictly an economic issue and would distract from goals including a plan to boost global GDP by more than $2 trillion over five years.
President Barack Obama miffed some in Abbott's administration when he said that among Asia-Pacific nations, "nobody has more at stake when it comes to thinking about and then acting on climate change" than Australia.
"Here in Australia it means longer droughts, more wildfires. The incredible natural glory of the Great Barrier Reef is threatened," he said.
Bishop said she was "surprised" by Obama's speech and later wrote to him, outlining Australian measures to protect the World Heritage-listed coral reef and assuring its preservation for generations to come. The Labor opposition described the government's response to the speech as petulant.
Obama also used his speech in Brisbane to pledge $3 billion to the Green Climate Fund, a U.N. initiative set up to support developing nations dealing with rising seas, higher temperatures and extreme weather events.
A previous Australian Labor Party government played a leading role in establishing the fund, which has received close to $10 billion in pledges from more than 20 countries. Australia has not offered money to the fund, though it says some of its foreign aid budget is spent on climate change mitigation.
Swedish Climate Ambassador Anna Lindstedt, who will be part of her country's delegation in Lima, said Australia's reluctance to contribute to the fund has created a "negative dynamic" in negotiations with large developing countries including China, who ask why they should be expected to contribute when Australia, one of the richest countries per capita, won't.
"Their climate negotiators are still doing a very good job and trying to be as constructive as possible, but it is a challenge under the current circumstances," Lindstedt said. "Some emerging economies are in some ways more progressive than Australia."
On the sidelines of the Brisbane summit, Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said global warming would be a top-agenda item when his country hosts the next G-20 leaders' summit at Antalya in 2015.
"The biggest challenge to all humanity today is climate change," Davutoglu said. Abbott's staff later snubbed Davutoglu's request for a photograph of the two leaders together to represent the presidency of the G-20 changing hands.
Abbott said after a recent meeting with French President Francois Hollande that it is "vital" that the Paris climate change conference succeeds. He added, "For it to be a success, we can't pursue environmental improvements at the expense of economic progress. We can't reduce emissions in ways which cost jobs."
Nic Stuart, a columnist for The Canberra Times, wrote this week that because of Abbott's doomed effort to keep climate change off the G-20 agenda, "a vital opportunity to jump-start his prime ministership with some international pizazz was squandered."
Abbott's popularity in opinion polling is at a record low for a first-term Australian prime minister. Key planks of his first budget, widely condemned as unfair to the poor, remain stalled in the Senate.
Climate change was the issue that brought Abbott to the helm of his conservative Liberal Party in a leadership ballot of lawmakers by a single vote in 2009. His predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull, was deposed over his plans to support the then-ruling Labor Party's legislation to create an emissions trading scheme.
Abbott is known for saying, also in 2009, that the "climate change argument is absolute crap." He later said the comment was "a little bit of rhetorical hyperbole."
This July, Australia became the only country to toss out an existing carbon-pricing system when Abbott's government repealed a carbon tax levied on the nation's 350 worst industrial greenhouse gas polluters.
Instead, the government has created a 2.55 billion Australian dollar ($2.2 billion) fund of taxpayer money to pay industries incentives to become cleaner. Abbott has ruled out any polluter-pays options for reducing Australia's greenhouse emissions, which on a per-capita basis are among the world's worst.
Abbott's government says its policies can bring the country's carbon gas emissions to 5 percent below 2000 levels by 2020.
Erwin Jackson, deputy chief executive of the Climate Institute independent think-tank, is doubtful. He said he hopes the Australian delegation in Lima agrees to contribute to the Green Climate Fund and proposes a credible plan to reduce Australian emissions post-2020.
"The challenge for them is that they don't have a sustainable or credible climate policy in Australia," Jackson said.

DLF gets reprieve in Gurgaon land caseGovt extends olive branch to Kalanithi Maran's Spicejet, allows ticket bookings for next 3 months
In a reprieve for real estate major DLF, the Supreme Court on Friday ordered a status quo against an order cancelling allotment of 350 acres of land to the developer in Haryana’s Gurgaon for Rs 1,700 crore.
Admitting its appeal against the September-judgement of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, the court stayed the operation of the order, which besides cancelling the allotment, had also ordered re-auction of the land. The land had been allotted to DLF in February 2010 by the Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd to build a recreation and leisure project, called the Magnolias, in Wazirabad in Gurgaon. The dispute arose when farmers challenged the acquisition of their land by the government. The High Court found no fault with the acquisition process but held that the allocation of the land to DLF was not transparent or fair. However, in a separate hearing, DLF suffered a setback as the court refused to accept its plea seeking a waiver of the Rs 480 crore penalty imposed on it for allegedly indulging in unfair trade practices. The developer has already deposited Rs 150 crore out of the Rs 630 crore penalty imposed on it by the Competition Commission.
Dismissing its application, the court refused to allow DLF to offer land as security, as an alternative to waiving the payment of the penalty and asked the developer to pay the amount in installments of Rs 75 crore each from January 15 till the penalty is cleared.

Road test and review: Mercedes-Benz C ClassPrint
Photos by Clint Thomas
Older siblings in the family are influencers on their younger counterparts as children generally admire their elders and look to them as role models. Same is the case with cars, and the newest example is the 2015 Mercedes-Benz C Class, as it inherits many character traits from its big brother S Class. The current generation S is certainly a technology and style masterpiece, so if the new C Class is inspired by the Mercedes flagship, then there should be a lot to like about it.
Design
You would be forgiven for mistaking the new C Class for the S in a passing glance. A closer look will only leave you more impressed, because it’s not just a scaled down version of the flagship and the new C has its own details and styling upgrades. The S Class-inspired LED adaptive headlights are definitely the highlight of the front design, while the grille is shared with the younger and more youthful siblings. Bumper is sophisticatedly sculpted and the chrome lines add just enough finesse to it.
Rear design too has strong S-class cues such as the integrated LED tail lamps but the tighter rump with curvier boot lid and a sportier bumper give the C Class its own identity. Dual exhaust openings on either side are seamlessly connected by a chrome accent and that looks absolutely trendy.
The cabin is a pleasing departure not only from the earlier C Classes but also the sameness that pervades Mercedes-Benz’ New Generation Cars (NGC) portfolio. The dashboard underscores the fact that the C and S are born of the same DNA. The aircon vents, seat control buttons and even the Burmester speakers are lifted from the S Class but the car’s uniqueness is evident in the flowing, wood finish centre console, a free-standing multimedia screen and the three-spoke steering wheel. The analogue clock on the centre console adds a touch of class to things.
A notable addition is the touch pad atop the rotary wheel that controls the functions of the multimedia screen. Though freestanding, the 8.4-inch screen is much better integrated with the dashboard design. If a lengthy equipment list is your priority, it's hard to go past the C Class. Three-zone climate control, reverse camera, a massive sunroof, satellite navigation, LED ambient lighting with three colours, push-button start and the 13-speaker Burmester music system – that’s just to name a few.
I particularly liked the electronically adjustable thigh support cushion that can be a blessing on long drives. However, this feature is available only on the front seats. Rear seats are fairly spacious, thanks to the longest wheelbase in the segment. Sitting at rear is not as enjoyable as in front, but ample legroom, headroom and features like foldout cupholders in the centre armrest, window blinds and AC vents with temperature control make the rear cabin comfortable. However, the high transmission tunnel could make the third occupant's life miserable. Boot capacity is generous at 480 litres but the space saver spare tyre hampers usability.
Performance
The new C Class draws power from a 2.0 litre turbocharged in-line four-cylinder petrol engine that develops 184PS @ 5500 rpm and 300Nm of maximum torque @ 1200 – 1400 rpm. Power is channeled to the rear wheels through a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. C Class will be available only in the petrol variant – C200 – for the time being, however, diesel is on its way. The push start button quietly brings the engine to life but it’s slightly audible when revved hard – and that’s music to many ears.
Making its debut in the C Class is the ‘Agility Select’ function that allows you to choose from five modes - Eco, Comfort, Sport, Sport+ and Individual (option to customize the different settings). While these modes can alter throttle response, steering firmness and transmission shift points, the fixed suspension settings can’t be changed.
Driving enthusiasts would certainly settle on Sport Plus, which offers more urgent throttle response and a thicker surge of torque along with linear steering that weigh up effectively under sharp cornering. The engine is pretty responsive on every mode and if you’re unhappy with the shift points on certain modes, there are steering wheel paddles to manipulate things your way.
The car is claimed to do 0-100km/h sprint in 7.3 seconds, on to a top speed of 235km/h. Fuel efficiency is certified at 14.74 km/l, as against the outgoing model’s 11.74 km/l.
Ride and Handling
There’s significant improvement in the way C Class rides and that’s particularly obvious on the highway, although the ride can become a little crashy on typical Indian conditions. The suspension’s India specific tuning ensures ample ground clearance to negotiate bumps and potholes. Precise handling means you can drive up twisties pretty rapidly and the C Class feels remarkably planted at high speeds, too.
Safety
As expected from a new Mercedes, the C-Class is loaded with standard safety kit including seven airbags, Attention Assist and tyre-pressure warning along with ABS, BAS, ESP, ASR, Hill Start Assist etc. Since there has been much ado about NCAP crash test results recently, it’s worth noting that the C has been given a five-star Euro NCAP crash test rating.
Bottom-line
Available only in petrol guise and being brought to India as CBUs (Completely Built Units) the C200 is priced at Rs 40.9 lakh ex-showroom Delhi. Locally assembled units and a more popular diesel variant will follow in March 2015.
The new fully loaded C is tad costlier than the outgoing model, which was priced between Rs 33.5 to 38 lakh. But what you get for the extra cash is a car high on elegance, modern technology and driver appeal – in other words, a downsized version of the S-Class flagship. The real charm of the new C Class is the way it perfectly balances everything you could ask for in a luxury sedan.

Is Black Friday still a big deal for America?

Falling unemployment
(US consumers flocked to…)
US consumers flocked to malls and stores on Friday as the annual holiday shopping season commenced, with some finding they'd lost out on the best deals as stores opened earlier than ever.
Irene Qu, a 22-year-old graduate student at Northeastern University, was shopping on Friday morning at the Prudential Center in Boston. Qu, who is from China, said she was underwhelmed by her first Black Friday experience. "The deals were not as much as I was thinking," Qu said while sitting at a food court with a group of friends. Yet the lack of sales didn't stop her from making purchases. She bought make-up for herself as well as a few gifts at Sephora. The National Retail Federation has forecast that about 140 million shoppers would hit the stores or shop online on Friday through Sunday. The rush kicks off a holiday season that the NRF projects to be the best in three years, helped by falling unemployment, rising wages and lower gas prices.
The day wasn't without some conflict, though. About 1,600 Walmart Stores Inc. locations were targeted by activists calling on the retailer to pay workers at least $15 per hour and let them work full time, according to OUR Walmart, a unionbacked group of employees. Protests occurred at locations in Los Angeles, Washington, Denver and Albuquerque, New Mexico, said the group, which has demonstrated on Black Friday for three straight years.
Holiday Spirit
Walmart said the crowds were made up mostly of paid union demonstrators who don't represent its 1.3 million US workers. "It's unfortunate that this group attempts to disrupt the holiday spirit to push their agenda," Brooke Buchanan, a Walmart spokeswoman, said in a statement on the company's website. "Perception is just not reality with the unions."
Consumers had the opportunity to start their shopping earlier this week as retailers experimented with spreading their deals over a longer period. Express Inc began offering 50% off everything starting November 25 through Friday noon, and Target rolled out pre-Black Friday deals of up to 60% off on some items. Still, the main wave of in-store deals started on Thanksgiving as many retailers expanded their hours on the holiday. JC Penney Co opened at 5 pm, compared with 8 pm in 2013. Macy's Inc and Target Corp opened at 6 pm, two hours earlier than last year.
  Spreading Bargains
Walmart is doling out its holiday bargains over the course of five days. The retailer's "New Black Friday" event includes sales in stores and on Walmart.com that began at 12:01 am on Thanksgiving and run through Cyber Monday.
Consumers now know they can get steep discounts throughout the holiday season, instead of just on Black Friday, and are adjusting their shopping accordingly, said Simeon Siegel, a New Yorkbased analyst at Nomura. Retailers need to accommodate this shift, he said. "You can't outsmart the consumer anymore," he said in a phone interview. "You need to pander to where the consumer wants to shop and when."
Walmart said tablets, televisions, sheets, children's apparel and videogame gear were the top five categories for sales in its stores so far. Walt Disney Co Frozen Snow Glow Elsa dolls were among the top toys of the night, Laura Phillips, senior vicepresident of merchandising for Walmart US, said in a statement. Target said the top-selling items in its stores were electronics and housewares, including Keurig K40 coffee brewers, Element 40-inch TVs, Microsoft Corp. Xbox One game consoles and Apple iPads.
Macy's chief executive officer Terry Lundgren said yesterday in an interview on Bloomberg Television that activewear and outerwear have been the big sellers for the department-store chain so far. "This is an outerwear season for the cold-weather climate stores," he said. "There was a little snow coming down, and it motivated people to buy more coats."
While about the same number of people as last year were expected to shop on Thanksgiving through Sunday, they are projected to spend more, according to the NRF, a Washington-based trade group. Retail sales in November and December may rise 4.1% this year, beating last year's 3.1% gain, the organization said.
Online Sales
More of those purchases may take place online instead of in brick-and-mortar stores. Shoppers plan to do 44% of their gift buying on the Web, the highest percentage ever, the NRF said last month. Thanksgiving Day online sales gained 14% from a year earlier, International Business Machines Corp said.

MH17 victim s mother takes Ukraine to human rights courtBy: Agence-France Presse | Berlin |
Posted: November 30, 2014 10:12 am | Updated: November 30, 2014 1:46 pm
The mother of a victim of downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 has begun legal proceedings against Ukraine at the European Court of Human Rights, accusing Kiev of failing to close the country’s airspace, a German daily reported on Sunday. The woman, who lodged her complaint at the Strasbourg-based court “last week”, is suing Ukraine for USD 1 million in damages for negligent homicide, the Bild newspaper said.
The Boeing 777 exploded over insurgent-held east Ukraine on July 17, killing all 298 on board, 193 of them Dutch. Four were German, according to the airline. Kiev and the West have accused separatists of shooting it down with a surface-to-air missile supplied by Russia – a charge Moscow denies.
The plaintiff in the case claims that Ukraine should have closed its airspace to civilian flights when fighting raged in the east of the country, Bild reported. The woman argues that Ukraine chose not to close its airspace because it did not want to lose out on overflight fees.
At the time, some 700 flights were thought to be crossing Ukrainian territory per day, bringing in several millions of dollars a month in revenue, Bild added. The woman is being defended by German lawyer Elmar Giemulla, a professor of aviation law. Giemulla announced in September he would represent three families of German victims of MH17.
“By keeping its airspace open for transit by aircraft from other countries, the state must ensure the safety of the flights. If this is temporarily impossible, it means that it should close its airspace,” he told AFP at the time.

Don the smart white jacket, be the patron saint of a fancy restaurant, or at least own one’s own Youtube channel. And yes, cook beautiful meals.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
By Anoothi Vishal
My journey started when I was younger," says Aryaman Sokhal, solemn, wise and all of 13. "I liked everything on TV then." Aryaman has been putting some confident finishing touches to a cake he has baked and brought out for my benefit. The words are in response to my obvious question: how and when did he start cooking. The Class VII Delhi Public School International, Delhi, student looks back at his "younger self" when, all of nine, he would watch cooking shows and want to whip up perfect desserts and starters.
Abhimanyu Batra, Aryaman's classmate, equally sagacious, is chopping spinach for the wholesome soup that's part of our meal. He wields the knife with an assurance that leaves me a bit shocked. Abhimanyu is not just confident with the tools of his trade but will not part with them even under duress. He has a collection of knives from all over the world, unshared, but obviously put to good use.
"I cook at least once a week," he says: "When we get any ingredient like chicken or fish at home, the cook cooks half, while I cook the rest my way." Not unexpectedly, he wants to be a chef. Or, well, "a cricketer". The boys have been rustling up a gourmet meal for yours truly, one sunny Sunday afternoon in Surajkund. There have been excited preparations; recipes and menus have been discussed in their car pool, ingredients personally shopped for, and as I bite into the starter-soup-mains-dessert spread, the third amateur cook in the group pips: "Did you like what we cooked? Really?"
Arnav Kishore's mother is a good cook, he says, so he follows her recipes, but is also fascinated by the fancy desserts and traditions like stuffed turkey on Thanksgiving that he sees on television. This afternoon, he has attempted a pasta aglio olio. Who says red and white are the only two preferences in Italianised-India? Or, Indianised Italia? Cooking is the new cool. We have been in the midst of this exploding pop culture for the past few years. On Instagram and Twitter, in restaurant conversations, in private parties, amongst real and virtual friends... So complete is the image makeover that even Bollywood is picking up cues: when Katrina Kaif asks Hrithik Roshan, grilling sweet nothings on a deserted island in Bang Bang, "You cook too?" one eyebrow raised, it is more than a question. It is gushing admiration.
Haute and Cool
But if cooking is cool, what is now even chicer is being a chef. Everyone wants to be one. Don the smart white jacket, be the patron saint of a fancy restaurant, or at least own one's own Youtube channel. And yes, cook beautiful meals.
"I have to admit, being a chef is pretty cool, just like being a painter or a writer. It is creative plus it allows you to meet people and has glamour attached to it," says Diva's Ritu Dalmia. As one of India's top chefs and a self-made one, Dalmia knows what she is saying.
In the late 1990s, when she started her first restaurant Mezza Luna as an untrained-but-passionate home cook, there was hardly any "culture of chefs". The restaurant didn't do well and Dalmia was even asked by some wealthy Dilliwallahs if she would come to their home and cook. "Being a chef was little more than being a glorified domestic help," she remembers.
That things have changed is an understatement — thanks to middle-class Indian's exposure to travel, restaurants and the explosion in media. Being a chef is perhaps seen as one of the hottest career options now — despite the reality of the kitchen that far outweighs any notions of glamour.
Dalmia, one of the few chefs in the country to accept interns in her restaurant kitchens, says the requests are so persistent that sometimes she has to sign promissory notes for those below 18 years, giving them her word that she will take them on once they come of age! Eeshaan Kashyap, a former medical student who gave up a career in biotechnology to turn professional chef, quips: "Being a chef is not just cool. It is sexy." Kashyap graduated from Oberoi Centre for Learning and Development. He has helmed the Trident property in Kochi and an entire luxury liner. He admits that putting 16-hour days in a hot kitchen may not make hell seem glamorous but is candid that being a chef is "flattering and adventurous". "You certainly stand out in a group if you are a chef...a sexy chef... It's quite charming to break ice with women and sip drinks!"
What Kashyap is pointing to is the new social acceptability for chefs in a hitherto feudal country. The image makeover may have come through the media but also via a hike in salaries. While trainees in hotels may get paid fairly little, top standalone restaurants pay executive chefs competent sums. Dalmia says that at all her restaurants, the second-in-commands take home salaries of Rs 12-15 lakh per annum ("and they are all in their 20s"), while top independent restaurants could pay executive chefs around Rs 25 lakh per annum.
Also, the climate of entrepreneurship means that most people who want to be chefs inevitably want to open their own restaurants. Saransh Goila, India's youngest TV chef and also popular on social media, says being a chef is cool because instead of being straitjacketed — like chefs in the past tended to be — it is now possible to blend many creative interests.
Goila, a Chandigarh boy, always wanted to cook. But he also wanted to be an actor. He decided that being a TV chef was thus his calling. He studied at the Taj-run school in Aurangabad. "While all my classmates wanted to open their own restaurants, I was clear, I wanted to be a TV chef because I had grown up watching chef Sanjeev [Kapoor]." Internet is another medium that has opened up alternative avenues. With three million Youtube views, Yaman Agarwal, 16, who calls himself a chef and pretty much cooks everything — from paneer butter masala to eggless cakes on his channel CookingShooking — is quite the child prodigy. "You can be a Youtube food celeb like him," points out Goila, and do comfortably well financially because you get paid per hit. Purists , of course, scoff that this is not being a professional chef at all. "While it is great that people are cooking, we should be clear about the difference between hobby cooks and professionals," says chef Sabyasachi Gorai, formerly with Olive Delhi (where he ran a school for chef aspirants) and now an independent consultant. But before we come to that, the other thing: boys and their cooking toys!

(Up-skilling yourself with…)
By Amrita Premrajan, TimesJobs.com Bureau
You might be a business executive working in marketing, sales or operations team of your organisation. Up-skilling yourself with knowledge of using analytics technologies might just give your career path a face lift. Here is why:
Case I: I am a business head responsible for sales and bottom-line profits of a major retailer.
Business needs:
* I want to analyse the past buying patterns of my customers * Based on this I want to predict the kind of stock which is in demand at a particular point, and also, forecast the mix of products which gets picked up by different age groups.
This will help me sell intelligently to different kinds of consumers and give them a great shopping experience.
How can I quickly churn out such business critical data based on historic and real time data without depending on my tech team for data analysis?
This is a typical challenge a lot of enterprises are facing today.
Inspite of the availability of the analytics and business intelligence technologies there is a lack of professionals who can read available data using analytics, in the context of business needs and changing consumer preferences.
Rare combination of business acumen and knowledge of data analytics in demand
Kapil Tyagi, co-founder & chief product officer, Edureka highlights the industry sentiments shared that today, business decisions are moving away from gut feel or simple dipstick survey to well thought out decisions backed by data.
"Indian industries are increasingly demanding business analysts, typically management graduates, who know how to use analytics tools to track patterns emerging from historic as well as real time data generated by enterprise apps such as CRM, social media feeds etc. Such experts are needed to bring out insights which can be translated into quick business decisions. But the challenge is that this is a rare combination to find," said Kapil.
He further shared that in the past few months Edureka has experienced an increase in demand for their analytics and data visualisation course among management graduates as well as among mid level business executives .
Understanding the emerging industry needs for such business analytics professionals, academic institutions such as IIM and MICA have also started offering courses in business analytics.
So, if you are a professional working in a business function - such as sales, marketing, operations - where analytics might take the business to the next level of profitability, this is just the right time to specialise in analytics.
Analytics courses for executives and management graduates
* Edureka offers business analytics course in R programming language
This entails classes on how to use R programming language for predictive analytics, association rule mining to perform prediction on the buyer's next purchase, data visualisation to plot, etc.
"R programming is slightly more difficult than Excel and the professionals learn how to apply statistical equations, model the data-set, cull out the required information and also forecast possibilities," said Kapil.
* MICA offers an online Post Graduate Certificate Programme in Market Research and Data Analytics (PGCPMRDA)
It is aimed at entry to mid level professionals who want to apply SAS and SPSS data analytical tools on market research data to come out with strategic business decisions.
* IIM Bangalore offers a Certificate Programme on Business Analytics and Intelligence
This program offers hands-on experience with software such as Microsoft Excel, Evolver, LINDO, Qlikview, SAS Enterprise Miner, SPSS, R, @RISK and other proprietary software to analyse using statistical and data mining techniques.
IIM B's data centre and analytics lab also offers various short term workshops for working professionals who want to specialise in analytics technologies.

Permission by HC to conduct rally a victory of masses: Amit ShahAmit Shah
(BJP national president…)
KOLKATA: BJP national president Amit Shah today said the permission given by Calcutta High Court for his rally here is a victory of the masses.
"After several hurdles and obstacles by the state government, I will address a public rally in Kolkata today. The permission given by the High Court is the victory of masses," Shah said in a Facebook post after arriving here.
Shah's rally was given the green signal on Saturday by the city municipal corporation and the fire department.
The Calcutta High Court had on Friday appointed two special officers to ensure compliance of fire services and municipal rules in the public meeting, observing that the government should not be rigid in the compliance of these rules while granting permission.

National Commission Women to get teeth  can probe  fine accusedNational Commission Women to get teeth, can probe, fine accused

The government has decided to enable the National Commission for Women Act with almost all the provisions of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). 
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: Short of giving the national commission for women (NCW) arrest powers, the government has decided to enable the NCW Act with almost all the provisions of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). This gives the commission enough teeth to investigate an accused and enables it to impose penalty on those who refuse to adhere to its summons.
Long considered as a toothless body where it could not even ensure adherence to its summons despite rising crimes against women, the Narendra Modi government has decided to give the NCW powers of a civil court, similar to the NHRC where it can ask the police to take into custody any repeat offender and ask investigative agencies to probe a case and submit a report within a fixed timeframe.
The law ministry last week cleared the related NCW (amendment) Act, finally agreeing to give it all powers of the NHRC, except a few which remain exclusive to the human rights body. The NCW bill, sources said, would also provide for appointment of a chairperson from retired Supreme Court or High Court judges or an eminent jurist.
However, this would in no way impact the incumbent NCW chairperson who is in office for a three-year period. Unlike, the NHRC chairperson who is appointed for a period of five years, the NCW chief is appointed for a period of three years.
Sources said the law ministry has agreed to the proposed amendments where the NCW may be given powers similar to the NHRC but not powers of arrest as demanded by the commission earlier.
Once civil court powers are accorded to NCW, it will have the authority to ask the police to ensure that its summons are adhered to, and seek action against those who repeatedly ignore its orders. When imposing penalty, it will be mandatory on a district magistrate to recover the penalty amount by issuing a formal order from the judicial magistrate of the area and deposit the same with the state exchequer.
Earlier, the law ministry had differed with the ministry of women and child development on conferring same powers to NCW as NHRC. The law ministry's objections were on the grounds that giving such powers to the commission was not possible since every member and chairman of the NHRC is a judicial member, unlike the NCW.
With an enabling provision to have a judicial member as its chairperson, the law ministry has now agreed for NHRC powers to be accorded to the NCW.

Black Friday: Know about the traditional kickoff to the holiday shopping season

Black Friday:
(The day wasn’t all about…)
The traditional kickoff to the holiday shopping season didn't seem as frenzied as in past years after many die-hard shoppers swarmed stores the night before on Thanksgiving. Still, millions of Americans headed out in search of deals. In Colorado, the new retail marijuana industry joined in the discounting, as did a brewery in Milwaukee. The day wasn't all about deals, though. In some regions, shoppers ran into protesters who turned out after a grand jury's decision not to indict a white police officer who fatally shot Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager. Elsewhere, protesters once again called on Walmart to pay its workers $15 an hour.
May Not be No. 1
Since 2005, Black Friday has held the crown for the top sales day of the year, according to ShopperTrak, which tracks data at 70,000 stores globally. That could change this year. The earlier openings on Thanksgiving are eating into Black Friday sales. As a result, the last Saturday before Christmas may edge out Black Friday. Bill Martin, co-founder of ShopperTrak, said it should be close to a tie. At Macy's, CEO Terry Lundgren says he thinks Black Friday will still be the company's biggest sales day of the year.
Best Buy Caught in the Net
Best Buy's website was down for about an hour in the evening after a morning outage that lasted more than an hour. Jeff Shelman, a company spokesman, attributed the morning glitch to "a concentrated spike in mobile traffic". He said the company had shut down BestBuy. com again because of "traffic-related issues".
Prison Crafts on Sale
Black Friday arrived at a prison craft store in Maine, too. The store in Thomaston opened early and cut prices by 40%. The Maine Prison Industries outlet store in Windham had a similar sale. The bookshelves, toys and models of the USS Constitution warship were made as part of an inmate work programme. Maine Prison Industries manager Ken Lindsey said prisoners are paid $1 to $3 per hour, which first goes toward court restitution and child support payments. The program me also teaches inmates job skills and people skills they can use upon release. Maine prisoners have made handicrafts for sale since the early 1800s, Lindsey said.
Marathon Shopper
At Westfield Fox Valley mall in Aurora, Illinois, parking spaces were plentiful and lines in many stores short or non-existent Friday morning. Some groggy shoppers were in their pajama pants. Kimberly States said it was noticeably quieter than the night before, when she made her first trip to the mall. "It was a zoo last night around 10 pm," she said. "Now it seems like more of the old folks."
Lesson for the UK
Black Friday is becoming a tradition in the UK, too, and businesses there are finding it can lead to chaos. Police were called to help maintain security at some supermarkets and shopping outlets that offered deep discounts starting at midnight. Greater Manchester Police said there were two arrests and some stores were closed early. Online retailer Amazon is believed to have introduced the concept of Black Friday to the UK four years ago, with more businesses joining every year since.
Of Beer and Bud
Some people wait in the cold for cheap TVs. In Wisconsin, they do it for beer. People arrived at Lakefront Brewery in Milwaukee early Friday to get a shot at the limitededition Imperial Stout Aged in Bourbon Barrels. A few stood outside overnight. Brewery spokesman Matt Krajnak estimated around 800 people were in line by the time doors opened, when it was snowing and about 15 degrees. In Colorado, the new retail marijuana industry joined the holiday rush too. The Grass Station in Denver offered deals on what some are calling "Green Friday". The most popular was an ounce of marijuana for $50, about $200 less than the normal price. Jarret Morgan picked up the last available ounce at the special price. He says it was the best deal he saw this year.
Walmart Protests
About 100 protesters outside a Walmart in Chicago called on the company to pay its workers $15 an hour and provide more fulltime positions. "Walmart, Walmart, you're no good! Treat your workers like you should!" they chanted. In Sacramento, California, a protester dressed as Santa Claus was arrested outside of a Walmart, organizers said. It's the latest round of protests to hit Walmart, with labour organizers saying demonstrations were planned for 1,600 locations Friday. Brooke Buchanan, a Walmart spokeswoman, said on Friday the company is not aware of anyone walking off the job. She said "a handful" of people worked their shifts before joining demonstrations.

Indian Employees Most Engaged Globally: ReportYour ATM Usage Pattern Need Not Hurt Your Pocket
New Delhi: A majority of Indian employees are performing intensely and their work engagement level is highest in the world, according to a report by BI Worldwide, an employee engagement solutions provider.
At the same time, six out of ten Indian employees are not working to their full potential while the younger employees are constantly on the lookout for a new job.
According to the report, 51 per cent of Indian employees are performing intensely, making them globally the most engaged in their work.
China is next in this manner with 49 per cent of employees performing intensely, followed by the US (38 per cent), Brazil (36 per cent), Canada (28 per cent) and the UK (24 per cent).
Though the level of employee engagement is very high in India, more than 6 in 10 Indians are not working to their potential, the report said.
"On an average, half of Indians admit to investing only 50-90 per cent of their effort at work. Moreover, three per cent of Indian employees report that they invest only half of their effort or less at work," the report said.
BI Worldwide conducted the survey to measure employee intensity of performance and commitment at workplace.
The survey spanned across seven countries namely India, Brazil, Canada, China, the US, the UK and the Latin American region outside of Brazil and covered nearly 7264 responses.
The report further said the older generation in India would prefer to stay at their current employer for almost seven years while the younger lot is planning to leave much sooner.
According to BI Worldwide research in India, Gen X (born between 1960s and 1980s) employees would like to leave in 4.7 years, while Gen Y (born between 1980s and 1990s) plans on staying for a mere 2.9 years.
Moreover, nearly a quarter of Gen Y employees who work full time in organisations larger than 500 employees have plans to leave their company within the next year.
"With entire career ahead of them, Gen Y employees are jockeying for position. They are experimenting. And they've realised that their income can grow more rapidly if they job-hop," the report said.
According to the report, the top five reasons why the Gen Y employees in India plan to leave are fear, job stress, a sense of unfair pay, a bleak or unknown future and for an innovative workplace where they can contribute ideas and make decisions.

Mutual fund investors are increasingly bypassing distributors and buying their units directly from a fund house. Since their introduction in January 2013, direct plans of mutual funds have been steadily gaining market share, according to data from industry association AMFI and rating agency Crisil.
They now account for a third of all money managed by Indian mutual funds.
From just 15 per cent in the March 2013 quarter, the share of direct plans in mutual fund assets crept up to 26 per cent in the September 2013 quarter. This further increased to 33 per cent in the latest, September 2014, quarter. In less than two years, direct plans have more than doubled their share.
Saving costs
The growing popularity of direct plans stems from a simple fact — they give investors better returns as the fund saves on the commission payable to the intermediary.
This translates into a higher net asset value (NAV) in direct plans.
The commission to intermediaries varies from 0.05-0.10 per cent of the NAV each year in liquid funds, 0.4-0.5 per cent in debt funds, and as much as 1 per cent in the case of equity funds. Compound these over a 5-10 year period, and direct plan investors could earn significantly more.
The category where direct plans have gained the most traction is fixed maturity plans (FMPs), accounting for more than half of the assets under management, up from just about 8 per cent in the March 2013 quarter.
In liquid/money market funds, too, direct plans’ share has risen to 57 per cent from 43 per cent in the March 2013 quarter.
These fund categories are dominated by companies, high net worth individuals and institutions — a set that is informed well enough to select its own schemes from the vast array on offer from funds.
This group accounts for the lion’s share (more than 70 per cent) of the total direct plan assets.
“The increasing share of direct plans within liquid funds and FMPs indicates that primarily institutional investors are opting for direct plans,” says Jiju Vidyadharan, Director – Funds and Fixed Income, Crisil Research. AMFI does not disclose investor category-wise data for direct plans.
Direct plans have also steadily grown their share in other debt fund categories such as income funds, ultra short-term funds and gilt funds — from 8-20 per cent of assets under management in the March 2013 quarter to 21-39 per cent in the recent September quarter.
In these segments too, it is the informed investor categories that account for the chunk of the portfolio.
Retail interest
But retail interest in direct plans has been rising too.
In equity funds, in which retail investors participate in a big way, direct plans’ share has increased to more than 6 per cent from just 1.3 per cent in the March 2013 quarter and 3 per cent in the September 2013 period.
Jimmy Patel, CEO of Quantum AMC, a fund house which does not empanel any distributors and offers only direct plans, confirms that in equity schemes many retail investors are now switching to direct plans.
It is investors in the big cities who have taken to direct investing more readily.
A recent analysis by Cafemutual, a leading portal for mutual fund distributors, found that a large part (74 per cent) of assets under management in direct plans in the equity category came from the top 15 cities.

ATF price cut to help airlines save bigATF price cut to help airlines save big
Surajeet Das Gupta & Aneesh Phadnis | New Delhi/Mumbai Dec 01, 2014 12:59 AM IST
With state-owned marketing companies reducing the prices of aviation turbine fuel (ATF) to Rs 59,943 a kilolitre from December 1 - 4.1 per cent lower than the previous month - domestic airlines' fuel bill in the second half of 2014-15 is estimated to come down by a combined Rs 1,200 crore.
ATF for domestic carriers has become 11.22 per cent cheaper since October and is expected to see more price cuts in the next three months. According to estimates by the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (Capa), fuel costs could fall by an average 15 per cent in the January-March period.
So, the average decline in fuel bill the last six months of the financial year could be 12-13 per cent. Since ATF accounts for over 50 per cent of domestic carriers' operating costs, this implies a substantial six per cent fall in their costs during the period. Airlines had bought Rs 18,674 crore worth of ATF for domestic flights last financial year.
Given that net profit margin over revenue of IndiGo, India's most profitable airline company, was only 2.85 per cent for 2013-14 - down from 8.3 per cent in 2012-13 - the reduction in ATF prices could prove a major boost for its bottom line and margins. According to analysts, IndiGo consumed about Rs 5,500 crore worth of fuel last year. Supposing its consumption pattern to be the same as last year and its other costs to remain the same, the ATF price decline could add Rs 350 crore to the company's bottom line.
For SpiceJet, Jet Airways and Air India, the price cut would mean a substantial reduction in losses. SpiceJet, for instance, had a fuel bill of Rs 3,252 crore in 2013-14. If it consumes the same amount of ATF as last year, it would save around Rs 200 crore on fuel cost in the October-March period. That would help it reduce its losses (Rs 1,003 crore last financial year).
However, there already are demands that airline companies pass on the benefit to consumers by reducing fuel surcharge in line with the fall in ATF prices. "Oil prices have been falling for the past four months and we feel the benefit should be passed on to customers. Airlines should reduce fuel surcharge," said
D Sudhakara Reddy, president of the Air Passengers Association of India.
But experts say the reduction in ATF prices could bring the much-needed turnaround to the aviation industry. Capa's India head, Kapil Kaul, says: "Subject to a sensible fare regime, we could see the beginning of a turnaround for Indian carriers, with oil prices softening, rupee remaining range-bound and the economy likely to grow around six per cent from next financial year." The benefits will be visible and give investors the confidence to bring more capital, Kaul adds.
Domestic carriers say their fares have already come down between October and December. "Fares now are 20 per cent lower than in October; those for flights up to seven days away have seen a sharp drop. You can get a one-way ticket to Mumbai from Delhi at under Rs 7,000. I don't see what we can pass on," says a senior executive of a leading Indian airline. International routes, though, might see some fare reduction, as Air India is considering lowering fuel surcharge.
That is unlikely to happen for domestic flights. "The aviation industry in India has been under stress. The price correction was required and will allow airlines to recoup losses. Input costs are still high and fares are driven by competition, and not cost. Fare reductions can be considered if airlines are able to break even," an Air India executive says.

E-tailers don t  like  Facebook axe on unpaid ad campaignsE-tailers don't 'like' Facebook axe on unpaid ad campaigns
Digbijay Mishra | New Delhi Dec 01, 2014 12:57 AM IST
Facebook's new policy, to come into effect from January, is set to hurt e-commerce companies and start-up businesses in India. The Mark Zuckerberg-led social media platform has decided to reduce overly promotional posts in newsfeeds and filter out unpaid marketing campaigns, widely used by Indian e-commerce companies and start-ups.
The policy, to be implemented across the world, would focus on what users want in their newsfeeds, rather than the promotional pages they like.
Indian e-commerce companies in particular have been using their Facebook pages extensively to reach out to as many consumers as possible, apart from paid advertisements. E-tailers maintain that a large chunk of their buyers are routed through Facebook promotions, both unpaid and paid. Estimates suggest about half the traffic to e-commerce sites come through Facebook.
"Beginning January next year, people will see less of such content in their newsfeeds. As we have said earlier, newsfeeds are already a competitive place - with more people and pages posting content, competition to appear in newsfeeds has increased. All of this means pages that post promotional creatives should expect their organic distribution to fall significantly over time," Facebook has said in a statement.
This is also being seen as a veiled move to increase revenue from advertisements on social media platforms.
Facebook said: "Newsfeeds have controls for the number of ads a person sees, and for the quality of those ads (based on engagement, hiding ads, etc), but those same controls have not been as closely monitored for promotional page posts. Now, we are bringing new volume and content controls for promotional posts, so people see more of what they want from pages." The company said its decision was based on a survey that showed there were certain consistent traits that made organic posts appear too promotional.
E-tailers with deep pockets might be able to absorb the new policy measure but emerging niche e-commerce companies and other new businesses could find it difficult to increase ad budgets on Facebook's user pages. According to an analyst, "the exact impact would depend on pricing".
There are two sides to it, many of the smaller companies will eventually get bigger with time.
"So, the latest move could result in reducing one's client base. On the other hand, such promotional platforms could not remain free for ever," said Arvind Singhal, founder & chairman of retail advisory firm Technopak.
Facebook, which has been growing its global user base at a staggering rate, recently crossed the 100-million mark in India.
Also, Facebook founder Zuckerberg's recent visit to the country is believed to have generated a greater optimism around his plans to expand deeper here.
With a focus on improving connectivity in rural India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also had a meeting with Zuckerberg during the latter's visit.

Gold tumbles after Swiss referendum  oil hits 5-yr lowGold tumbles after Swiss referendum; oil hits 5-year low
Reuters
Reuters Gold bars and Swiss Franc banknotes are seen in this illustration picture taken at the GSA in Vienna
Tokyo, Dec 1:  
Gold prices tumbled on Monday after Swiss voters overwhelmingly rejected the proposals to boost gold reserves in a referendum, joining the broad rout in commodities that sent oil prices to five-year lows and copper to four-year lows.
Sinking oil and commodity prices are causing massive realignments in markets, hurting assets tied to the resource sector, from Australian mining shares to the Malaysian ringgit, while benefiting importers such as Japan and China.
Swiss says "NO" to #gold ... @ $1148 now Charts turn ugly..$1000-$950 next???
— Gurumurthy K (@gurukmurthy) December 1, 2014
MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.0 per cent, with resource-heavy Australian shares hitting a six-week low.
Gold fell more than two per cent at one point to $1,142.90 per ounce, its lowest level in more than three weeks, while silver also took a hit, falling more than six per cent to a five-year low below $14.50 per ounce.
Swiss gold reserves
The Swiss measure, had it been approved, would have compelled the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to more than double its gold reserves and banned it from ever selling the metal, threatening its ability to defend a €1.20 euro on the Swiss franc imposed at the height of the euro zone crisis.
The Swiss franc dipped to 1.2042 on the euro from 1.2018 at the end of last week, though the Swiss currency is supported by investors who still regard it as one of the safest currencies in the world. It last stood at 1.2036.
“The result should of course temporarily relieve the pressure on the SNB’s currency floor, albeit whilst doing little or nothing in our opinion to reverse the fundamental downward trajectory of EUR/CHF,’’ said JPMorgan analyst Paul Meggyesi.
Oil at 5-year low
Oil prices hit five-year lows, unable to find a bottom despite their biggest fall in 2 1/2 years last week after OPEC held back from cutting output in the face of a supply glut.
US crude fell more than two per cent to a five-year low of $64.10 per barrel, with the fall from June exceeding 40 per cent.
Copper also fell to as low as $6,230.75, piercing below its March low to hit its lowest levels since mid-2010.
The Australian dollar fell more than one per cent to a four-year low, of $0.8417, and so did the Malaysian ringgit, which fell to 3.424 to the dollar.
Chinese manufacturing data
Adding salt to commodities’ wounds, Chinese official manufacturing data suggested growth is slowing in China, demand from which has supported commodity prices for years.
Deflation fears
Sliding oil and raw material prices have stirred deflation fears in the euro zone and Japan, cementing expectations that the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan will take more steps to support their respective economies.
The dollar, taking advantage of such concerns, attracted bids against the euro and yen.
The euro was slightly weaker at $1.2437 after having fallen on Friday on data showing annual inflation in the euro zone cooled to five-year lows of 0.3 per cent in November.
ECB stimulus measures
Many traders expect the ECB may signal further action later this week to ward off deflation.
The dollar also hit a seven-year high of 119.03 yen and the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, rose to 88.451, a four-year high.
“Given that the Fed is going to raise rates next year, the monetary policy divergence should support the dollar,’’ said Osao Iizuka, head of FX trading at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank.
The yen’s fall and lower commodity prices helped Japanese shares, with the Nikkei rising to seven-year highs. Mainland Chinese shares also gained, with Shanghai Composite Index hitting a three-year high.

Relieved DLF aims to clock Rs 3500cr sales bookings in FY15
“Borrowing rates are moving southwards in rental portfolio,” DLF Group CFO Ashok Tyagi said
Post your opinion here
08:00 am
The Supreme Court’s decision to allow  DLF to deposit the in remaining 480 crore fine in monthly installments with respect to the CCI case , is a welcome relief, Group CFO Ashok Tyagi said.
In a separate hearing, the apex court ordered status quo with respect to the 350 acres Wazirabad land allotment case . This land was allotted to the realty player in 2010 by the Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corp. Ltd. The dispute arose when farmers challenged the acquisition of their land by the government.
Speaking to CNBC-TV18 about the company’s future plans, he said the company would be launching one additional product in the luxury segment. DLF aims to clock Rs 3,500 crore of sales bookings in FY15.
Below is the verbatim transcript of Ashok Tyagi's interview with Latha Venkatesh and Sonia Shenoy on CNBC-TV18.
Sonia: If you could tell us how you will be financing this entire payment that you have to make of Rs 630 crore? I understand that it will be in instalments now but will you finance it through profitability, through your cash reserves, what will be the debt situation now and how much pressure would you see?
A: Even in our analyst presentation and that stand continues that obviously while post the order that we got from Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), which did to some degree impact our ability to raise money through non-convertible debentures etc but we are working with the banks to ensure that we stay liquid and we should hopefully do so. However, it will be very obvious to say that this is a welcome relief to the degree that the honourable Supreme Court (SC) had given it and we will obviously pay it as and when the court demands it.
Latha: Overall what is the working capital and debt position? Are things getting a little better even if you cannot access the equity markets, on the debt side are things getting a little better because banks are saddled with a lot of cash and very few borrowers, effectively is borrowing rates coming down?
A: The way I would say it is the borrowing rates on the rental assets, which is the lease/rental discounting and mortgage bound and those sort of products are clearly southwards. The borrowing rates on the development side of the business are still firm at somewhere between 12.5 percent and 13 percent levels but on the rental side, clearly they are on the downward trend for sure.
Latha: This particular relief that you don’t have to pay Rs 480 crore right away will improve things a bit or is it just that a potential problem has gotten resolved that’s all?
A: I think it is the latter because the fact is that I still need to provide for Rs 480 crore, it is just that across -- instead of it being on a single day, it needs to be provided across maybe a period of 6-7 months but clear liquid provision has to be carried in the books and in the treasury to ensure that whatever is the final SC decision, is honoured.
DLF stock price
On December 10, 2014, DLF closed at Rs 139.35, down Rs 5.55, or 3.83 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 242.80 and the 52-week low was Rs 100.00.
The company's trailing 12-month (TTM) EPS was at Rs 3.29 per share as per the quarter ended September 2014. The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was 42.36. The latest book value of the company is Rs 93.40 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company is 1.49.

BSE Sensex rises 94 pts in early tradeSpiceJet shares continue to plunge; down 17 pct
The NSE Nifty rose 34.75 points to hit a new peak of 8,623.00 and the benchmark BSE Sensex gained over 115 points to 28,693.99 in late morning deals after the country’s manufacturing output accelerated in November at the quickest pace in nearly two years.
Besides, hopes of rate cuts by the RBI in its monetary policy review tomorrow also influenced the market sentiment.
The Nifty soared to a new high of 8,623.00, surpassing its earlier record of 8,617 touched on November 28, as the buying activity gathered momentum on the back of better-than-expected GDP data of 5.3 per cent in the July-September quarter.
Buying was witnessed in banking, auto, FMCG, healthcare and IT sectors supported by shares from midcap and smallcap companies.
The 30-share Sensex rose by 115.65 points, or 0.40 per cent, to 28,809.64 after touching a low of 28,672.73.
Similarly, the NSE 50-share barometer climbed by 34.75 points, or 0.40 per cent, to trade at a new life-time high of 8,623.00, breaching previous high of 8,617 reached on November 28.
Meanwhile, the headline HSBC India Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) — a composite gauge designed to give a single-figure snapshot of manufacturing business conditions — stood at 53.3 in November significantly higher from 51.6 in October.
Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) bought shares worth a net Rs 935.86 crore last Friday, as per provisional data.
Asian stocks traded mostly lower today as Chinese manufacturing gauge dropped, American holiday spending slowed and oil tumbled to a five-year low.
Asian bourses of Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, Indonesia and South Korea fell by 0.47 pct to 1.8 pct. While the key indices in China and Hong Kong rose 0.73 pct to 0.87 pct.

Uber to stop accepting credit  debit cards from todayUber to stop accepting credit, debit cards from today
Samie Modak | Mumbai Dec 01, 2014 10:17 AM IST
Indian users won't be able to use a debit or credit card anymore to book a ride from Uber. 
"Starting today, December 1st, you will no longer be able to request a ride using your credit card or debit card directly through the app. For those holding an Indian credit card, the Paytm wallet will be the only payment method available," Uber said in a statement early Monday.
The move follows problems Uber faced with the 'two-factor authentication' process mandated by Indian banking regulator Reserve Bank of India (RBI). 
 
As a safety measure, all credit and debit card transactions must undergo a two-step process for honouring payments. Typically, a user swipes or enters the credit/debit card information in the first step and then has to enter a password in the second step. 
 
Uber followed only one-step authentication, which fell foul of RBI rules. 
 

State government likely to re-open Maval firingcaseBy: Express News Service |
Posted: December 1, 2014 11:18 am
On the eve of the December session of the state legislature, the Devendra Fadnavis lead government might order for re-opening of the 2011 Maval firing case. Mava’s MLA Bala Bhedge, who is tipped to be included in the state cabinet said that he has taken up the case with the chief minister and other senior party leaders already.
Three farmers had lost their lives and a host of others were injured when police had opened fire at a group of protesting farmers on the Expressway. The farmers were protesting against the proposed closed water pipeline to convey water from the Pavana dam to Pimpri Chinchwad. The erstwhile deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had supported the project. Post the firing the state government had formed a single judge commission to investigate the incident whose report was submitted subsequently. However no action was taken on it.
Bhegde and other party leaders said that they want to take up the case and see that justice is done to the farmers. “I will be speaking to the corporation to ensure the next of kin of the slain farmers are given government jobs,” said Bhegde

Dhaka Boundary Settlement: Narendra Modi bites theBulletWritten by C Raja Mohan |
Posted: December 1, 2014 11:10 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 11:17 am
In telling the BJP workers in Assam that India will go ahead with the ratification of the land boundary agreement with Bangladesh, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has put the imperatives of national interest above the regional populism of his own party.
The land boundary agreement signed in Dhaka by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in September 2011 involves rationalisation of the messy boundary that India inherited from the partition of the Subcontinent. Since it involves the ‘exchange’ of territories, the agreement required an amendment to the Constitution.
The 119th amendment bill was placed in the Rajya Sabha late last year amidst vociferous opposition from the Trinamool Congress of Bengal and the Asom Gana Parishad in Assam. While the national leadership of the BJP did not oppose the tabling of the bill, it signaled ambivalence given the opposition from the party unit in Assam.
Much of the debate in Bengal and Assam about the agreement has been ill-informed. The agreement deals with tiny enclaves owned by one country but left inside the territory of the other at the time of Partition. This led to the tragedy of many people being left state-less and unable to access the benefits of development from either state. These enclaves have also become major sources of criminal activity.
Delhi and Dhaka rightly decided to exchange these enclaves after a survey of opinion in these enclaves–India would ‘cede’ 111 enclaves amounting to about 17,160 acres and ‘gain’ 57  enclaves spread over 7110 acres from the other.
The loss and gain of territory here is entirely notional for neither side was in control of these enclaves that they owned in theory since 1947. The overwhelming sentiment among people trapped in these enclaves is to stay put where they are rather than move to the other country.
While the Congress government in Assam supported the agreement, the Trinamool, AGP and the BJP played political football by raising concerns about ‘loss’ of territory.
Modi affirmed that the territorial swap with Bangladesh is in the interests of the nation. He also promised the people of Assam that Delhi will address their concerns on illegal immigration from Bangladesh. By framing an argument that limits the tension between ‘national’ and ‘regional’ interests, Modi has set the stage for the parliament’s approval of the 119th Constitution Amendment Bill.
The standing committee on external affairs had recently cleared the bill and the government is expected to seek approval of the two houses. India’s ratification of this agreement will mark a comprehensive territorial settlement of its longest land border. At 4060 km, India’s boundary with Bangladesh is longer than those with China and Pakistan.
Having a settled boundary will now allow Delhi and Dhaka to consider effective management the border–through more intensive cooperation on countering terrorism and extremism, facilitating trade across this long frontier, building trans-border industrial corridors and preventing illegal continued…

India to stay put as Adelaide likely to host series opener in the aftermath of Phillip HughestragedyBy: Press Trust of India | Adelaide |
Posted: December 1, 2014 11:09 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 7:01 pm
The first cricket test between Australia and India will now take place in Adelaide as part of a major reshuffling of the series following the death last week of Australian batsman Phillip Hughes.
The first test was supposed to start in Brisbane on Thursday but has been delayed until next week and switched to Adelaide to give grief-stricken players more time to recover with Hughes’ funeral taking place on Wednesday.
“Nobody should underestimate just what these players are going through right now,” Cricket Australia (CA) chief executive James Sutherland said in a statement on Monday.
“These are difficult days and we need to support them in dealing with their grief.
“It’s very clear that playing a Test right now is just too soon and we are reacting accordingly.”
The Australian and Indian cricket boards met with the players’ union (ACA) and other key stakeholders, including broadcasters and commercial partners, before agreeing on a new schedule for the lucrative Border-Gavaskar series.
The dates for three of the four tests were changed and the entire series squeezed into 33 days, despite fears of player burnout before the World Cup, which will be held in Australia and New Zealand early next year.
“Based on our discussions with the players and with support of health experts, we believed the first test in Brisbane was still too early for them to return to the field, and that the Adelaide test presents more time for them to grieve and mentally prepare,” ACA chief executive Alistair Nicholson said.
Adelaide Oval, which was due to host the second test from Dec. 12-16, will now host the series opener from Dec. 9-13, in what is sure to be a highly emotional occasion.
Brisbane will now host the second test from Dec. 17-21 while the third test will proceed as planned from Dec. 26-30 in Melbourne.
The fourth and final test will still take place in Sydney in the New Year, but will start on Jan. 6, three days later than originally scheduled.
Some changes were expected after CA postponed the start of the first test and the Indian team, currently in Adelaide, cancelled their flight to Brisbane on Monday.
Hughes died in a Sydney hospital last Thursday, two days after he was struck in the head by a short-pitched delivery during a domestic first-class match.
His death has triggered an outpouring of emotion, sympathy and support from inside and outside the cricketing world.
The funeral for the left-hander, who would have turned 26 on Sunday, will be held in his hometown of Macksville in northern New South Wales.
Hughes was a popular member of the Australian cricket community and several members of the Australian team were playing in the match when he was struck by the ball.

Shiv Sena leaders meet Maharashtra CM Fadnavis  power sharing issue likely to be resolved todayDec 01, 2014 at  10:52am IST
Shiv Sena leaders meet Maharashtra CM Fadnavis, power sharing issue likely to be resolved today

Mumbai: As talks over Maharashtra government formation between Bharatiya Janata Party and Shiv Sena are heading in a  positive direction, the issue could be resolved on Monday, said sources. The BJP has been trying hard to bring Sena to the board for a post-poll alliance before the winter session, which commences on December 8.
Shiv Sena leaders met Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis to hold talks on power-sharing in the morning. Sena sources said talks on the government formation are in final stages and could be resolved today.
Today's meeting comes as part of a series of meetings between the two parties raising speculations of ties being on the mend.
Fadnavis had also expressed his desire to have Sena as part of the government. He had said, "BJP wants that Sena join the government. We fully favour this."
Sena has been adamant on taking deputy chief minister's post and some key portfolios for its leaders.
There were reports of a deal being reached between BJP President Amit Shah and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and of Sena likely to get 10 berths in the Fadnavis government, with at least four of Cabinet rank, but there was no confirmation of the same.
Even though the Sena wanted the BJP to come clear on the post-poll alliance before the floor-test on November 12, the latter refused to do so. Fadnavis had made it clear that the cabinet would be expanded only after the floor-test and left both the Sena and Nationalist Congress Party guessing on the post-poll alliance.
The BJP has a total of 122 seats in the 288-member Maharashtra Assembly and claimed support of independents and smaller parties, taking the strength to 138. Sena is the second largest party with 63 MLAs and has staked claims for the Opposition party in the House.
While the BJP does not have majority without Sena, the Sena too cannot play the role of an effective opposition party in the state while sharing power at the Centre.
The 25-year-old alliance broke over the seat-sharing issue in the Maharashtra Assembly elections as both the parties struck to its demand of seat to contest. The ties hit a new low after the Centre inducted Suresh Prabhu into the Union Council of Ministers on BJP quota ignoring Sena's choice.

New Delhi: The Income Tax department will open bank lockers of Uttar Pradesh Chief Engineer Yadav Singh in at least 12 banks located in Noida, Delhi and Ghaziabad on Monday, said sources. The I-T department had recovered diamonds worth Rs 100 crore, Rs 10 crore in cash and around 2 kgs of gold from Yadav's residence.
The investigation has revealed that the official had floated several shell companies.
Singh had been accused in another case and had been declared an absconder in 2012. But in 2013, the state government reinstated him and even gave him additional charge as Chief Engineer of Greater Noida and in-charge of Yamuna Expressway Authority.
Sources said that the state government was in the process of suspending Singh. The Principal Secretary of Industrial development has sought a report from the Noida development authority.

Former Arunachal CM Jarbom Gamlin passes awayFormer Arunachal CM Jarbom Gamlin passes away
PTI
Gurgaon/Itanagar, Dec 1:  
Former Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Jarbom Gamlin died at a hospital last night in Gurgaon.
According to his family sources, Gamlin, aged 53, was suffering from liver thrombosis. He is survived by his wife, three daughters and a son.
His body will be flown to Aalo in West Siang district of Arunachal on Tuesday, they said.
Born on April 16, 1961 at Aalo, Gamlin studied at Sainik School in Goalpara in Assam and graduated in History from St Stephen’s College in Delhi. He obtained his law degree from Campus Law Centre, University of Delhi, in 1984. Later, he practised as a lawyer in Dibrugarh.
He was President of the All Arunachal Pradesh Students’ Union (AAPSU) for three years from 1981.
Although Gamlin first joined the People’s Party of Arunachal, he switched over to Congress and was a member of the Lok Sabha from 1999-2004.
In 2004, he was elected to the state Assembly and became Home Minister in the Gegong Apang ministry. In 2009, he became Power Minister in the Dorjee Khandu government.
On May 5, 2011, Gamlin became the Chief Minister of Arunachal Pradesh after the death of Dorjee Khandu in a chopper accident.
His six-month-long chief ministerial tenure came to an end on October 31, 2011 after he resigned from the post following political upheaval in the State.
Gamlin was also elected to the Assembly this year.

Kisan Vikas Patra: a re-launch with very few justificationsKisan Vikas Patra: a re-launch with very few justifications
C. R. L. NARASIMHAN
Tweet
December 1, 2014:  
Despite some criticism and misgivings in certain quarters, the Government has decided to re-introduce the Kisan Vikas Patra (KVP), a savings instrument that was discontinued three years ago. Positioned as a savings instrument in line with other continuing ‘small savings schemes’ such as the Public Provident Fund (PPF) and the National Savings Certificates (NSCs), the new KVP, like its predecessor, has certain advantages as well as disadvantages over these. Most ordinary investors will compare the new KVP with bank deposits and other debt instruments.
Broad features of the new KVP
* Interest: 8.7 per cent.
* Tenure: eight years and four months (100 months).
* Investment doubles in 100 months.
* Minimum lock-in period two years and six months.
Liquidity
* Can be encashed in eight equal monthly instalments after the lock-in period
* Can be transferred to another person by endorsement and delivery
* Can also be given as collateral for loans by banks
* Minimum investment Rs.1,000. Thereafter, in denominations of Rs.5,000, Rs.10,000 and Rs.50,000. There is no maximum limit.
* Taxability: fully taxable
* Mode of investment: cash or cheque
* Know your customer (KYC) norms: PAN not required but identity/address proof required
* Will be sold initially through post offices across the country, but later through some Government-owned banks also
How does the new KVP fare?
Any investment proposition needs to be evaluated in terms of certain well-defined parameters. These include safety, security, yield or return, liquidity, accessibility, convenience and tax advantage. These parameters are relevant for any investment proposition whether debt or equity.
For convenience sake, the re-launched KVP can be compared on the one hand with the existing savings instruments, and with bank deposits on the other. In comparison to its previous version, the new KVP offers a 0.5 percentage point higher yield (8.7 versus 8.2). Investment under the old KVP doubled in eight years and seven months. In the new KVP, the doubling takes place in eight years and four months.
A comparison with a discontinued scheme is not particularly useful. In relation to the existing savings schemes, the yield on the new KVP is on a par with the PPF and the NSCs. It is equally safe. The Government would make it more easily available and also educate customers. Accessibility to the KVP should not be a problem.
Comparing with bank deposits
Taking three other relevant traits — liquidity, convenience and tax advantage — the new KVP is reasonably liquid. Investors can come out after the minimum lock-in period in eight equal instalments. The KVP can also be given as collateral. Unlike PPF and NSCs, the KVP does not have a tax advantage. Interest on it is fully taxable.
Bank deposits are superior to KVP in terms of returns — three-year fixed deposits offer 9 per cent and some banks even more. The argument that deposit rates are set to fall over the medium-term is no doubt valid, but one expects the banks to safeguard their depositors’ concerns by floating innovative schemes. It is also certain that the corporate bond market will revive and be a conduit for infrastructure finance. This will matter to senior citizens and others who want a fixed, steady return in the form of investment in infrastructure bonds. Bank deposits are liquid, absolutely secure and highly accessible to most middle-class investors. They have a minimum tax advantage — practically restricted to interest on savings accounts.
For those who have no access to banks, investment in KVP may be a worthwhile proposition. Having no tax concessions, the KVP as in investment is for those who do not pay taxes at all or are in the lower tax bracket.
The biggest advantage claimed for the KVP — indeed its USP — is that it is a bearer bond, transferable by endorsement and delivery. This confers unmatched anonymity to the holder of the instrument.
Policy perspective
But that precisely is its main drawback from a policy perspective. The earlier version was discontinued because it was suspected of being a conduit for laundering black money.
In the new KVP too, there is very little compliance of KYC norms that are routinely applied by banks, mutual funds and the like. In fact, it is the conviction that the onerous KYC norms are driving away bank customers at a time when household financial savings have dipped seriously, that seems to have prompted the Government to re-launch a new instrument with very few entry barriers, The Finance Minister has clarified that certain precautions will be taken for large investments in KVPs.
How that reflects on the new KVP’s success in terms of collections remains to be seen. Whatever way one looks the KVP has very few justifications beyond the obvious — mobilising funds by the Government at all costs.

Rupee trading weak at 62.13Rupee ends flat at 62.02
Our Bureau
Tweet
Mumbai, Dec 1:  
The rupee erased its earlier losses during the day to end almost flat at 62.02 to the dollar against Friday’s close of 62.03 due to the American dollar's gains against other currencies overseas.
Rupee under pressure ahead of monetary policy, below 62 again. The $24 bn of FPI money that moved in to debt this year is at stake here.
— lokeshwarri sk (@lokeshwarri) December 1, 2014
In intra-day trade, the domestic unit touched a high of 62.25 and a low of 62.02. According to market watchers, dealers avoided taking long positions ahead of the Reserve Bank of India’s bi-monthly monetary policy review tomorrow.
Bond yields slip to 8.03%
Yield on the benchmark 10-year bond hit 8.03 per cent, the lowest level since August 2013, on continued fall in global crude prices. Brent crude prices were near four-year lows after oil producers’ club OPEC decided to not cut oil output. Harihar Krishnamoorthy, treasurer at FirstRandBank, said, “The market believes that the OPEC’s decision to not cutback production will last for some time.” According to NS Venkatesh, Executive Director (Treasury & International Banking), IDBI Bank, the market has been showing irrational exuberance and if the RBI does not cut rates in the policy announcement scheduled tomorrow, it may lead to hardening of bond yields to 8.15 per cent levels.

Rupee logs fresh 9-month low in early tradeForex update: Rupee recovers from over 9-month low, ends at 62.02 against US dollar
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: December 1, 2014  | 18:41 IST
(Photo: Reuters)
The rupee on Monday recovered from initial losses and edged marginally higher at 62.02 against the Greenback, snapping a two-day losing trend, on late dollar selling by exporters and some banks.
After opening weak, the rupee hit a fresh nine-month low of 62.25 against US currency as traders reacted to government easing curbs on gold imports and economic growth for second quarter coming at a tepid 5.3 per cent. However, the local unit erased the losses and closed marginally higher by one paisa.
At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market, the rupee commenced sharply lower at an intra-day low of 62.25 a dollar from Friday's close of 62.03 .
The mood was a bit cautious ahead of Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) monetary policy review .
"Over this week, we expect the pair to trade within a range of 61.60/80 and 62.30/40 levels on spot. RBI monetary policy and US November jobs report will be key data points," said Anindya Banerjee, Currency Analyst, Kotak Securities.
Later, the rupee rebounded on dollar selling by some banks and exporters and ended at an intra-day high of 62.02 against the American unit, up 0.02 per cent.
In the previous two sessions, the rupee had lost 19 paise.
The domestic currency had little help from the domestic stock market on Monday as the benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) index Sensex closed 134.37 points (or 0.47 per cent) lower.
There was support for the rupee from data released by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) that showed FPIs/FIIs infused US $396.24 million in the domestic market on Friday.
The dollar index, a gauge of six major global rivals, was down by 0.15 per cent. Oil prices fell to a five-year low and even gold rates fell as global investors were risk-averse.
Pramit Brahmbhatt, CEO, Veracity Group said, the trading range for the spot rupee is expected to be within 61.60 to 62.40.
In the forward market, premia closed steady to weak on stray receipts from exporters.
The benchmark six-month premium payable in May ended at its last Friday's closing level of 224-226 paise while forward contracts maturing in November, 2015, softened to 433.5-435.5 paise from 435-437 paise.
The RBI fixed the reference rate for dollar at 62.1377 and for the Euro at 77.3677.
The rupee fell back against the pound to 97.48 from Friday's close of 97.34 while it moved down further to 77.31 per euro from 77.29.
The domestic unit, however, improved further to 52.36 per 100 Japanese yen from 52.48 last Friday.

With tax incentives  pension funds can be on a par with EPFOTax implications of second home: Various scenarios
The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) is getting ready to bring in a host of regulatory measures in the next two months. New PFRDA Chairman Hemant Contractor, who was till recently MD of State Bank of India, spoke to George Mathew about a host issues from tax sops, fee structure to new plans in an interview. Excerpts:
What is your agenda for the pension sector?
The Act was passed last year and was notified in February this year. We are now putting in place all regulations to make the Act effective. We have to finalise 14 or 15 regulations in the next two months. That’s our immediate priority. Otherwise you can’t make the Act effective. The role of various stakeholders, aggregators, the role of trustees, record keeping agencies and custodians…all these things are getting finalised. The pushing of pension products, especially under Jan Dhan, is also a focus area.
Is the pension fund market growing?
The organised sector is fairly well covered. The EPFO covers all organised companies, the government and all civil servants are covered. What remains is the unorganised sector. This segment include hawkers, drivers, maidservants, rickshaw-wallahs. It’s not very easy to cover. That’s one we are now targetting. This is the bottom of pyramid and it’s not an easy job. We have been growing well. In the NPS Lite, which is the low-cost pension product, the numbers have touched 35 lakh. Last year we doubled the number. This year our plan is to grow by 50 lakh. Out of the fund size of Rs 70,000 crore, nearly 80 per cent is government money. The subscriber base will grow. These subscribers are small players and they hardly pay Rs 1,000 or Rs 2,000.
Are returns matching expectations? Will you hike equity investment limit?
On the returns front, we are on a par with all the private sector fellows. This is because the investment pattern has been made like that. You can go up to 50 per cent in equity. We have the lowest cost pension product. With just Rs 50, you can have a pension product. On hiking equity limit, subscribers are not very keen. They have gone up to only 15-16 per cent in equity though theoretically they can go up to 50 per cent.
Will you get a level playing field on the tax front vis-a-vis EPFO?
We have been asking for tax incentives so that we can be on par with EPFO products. Right now it’s EET (no tax during contribution and accumulation but taxed during withdrawal) pension and we want to make it EEE (no tax at any of the stages). The government said we will look at it. When the tax issue is sorted out, there will be lot more interest.
Is there any plan to bring EPFO under PFRDA or allow more players?
No. EPFO is kept out of our purview. The Act also says that. Right now there are seven pension fund managers in operation. We reviewed the position only in January this year. There’s no immediate plan to review the system.
Are you able to bring corporates under your pension plan?
We have got around 1,500 corporates. The fund size is just about Rs 1,300 crore. We would like that sector to grow. There is lack of awareness which is an issue. This product, NPS, is not very well known. Our attempt is to popularise it among corporates.
There is a complaint from pension players that they are not getting enough remuneration? Do you plan to revise the fee?
It was an open bidding process. They have themselves to blame. They keep saying you have to revise the fee. There’s no immediate plan to do it. We will be looking at it. We don’t think it’s low. If they start losing interest in the industry, that’s also not good for the industry. We would like to have a balanced view of things. Our first priority is to put in place all regulations so that everybody understands their responsibilities. When that’s done, we will look at other things.
What will be the impact of the Insurance Bill on pension sector? Will more foreign players come into the sector?
It will be automatically applicable in the pension fund sector. Not many (foreign players) have come. I don’t know how much foreign interest it will attract. When it was 26 per cent, there was not much activity. At 49 per cent, maybe some players might come in. But the thing to note is that the market to be tapped is the unorganised market. This market is big, but may not be immediately attractive to foreign players. They will probably come in when the market grows a little bit.

Citi ups Sensex target to 33K; top 20 bets | Oil @ $68  HPCL up 3%Brent
SINGAPORE: Oil fell more than $2 a barrel to a five-year low in Asian trade on Monday, extending a steep sell-off after OPEC decided not to cut production last week, keeping markets well supplied.
Both U.S. crude and Brent have fallen for five straight months, oil's longest losing streak since the 2008 financial crisis.
"Just when the market was thinking that a 4-year low for crude oil was bad enough, we have hit a 5-year low after the OPEC meeting," Phillip Futures analysts said in a note.
U.S. crude tumbled to near $64, dragging Brent down below $70, after Saudi Arabia's oil minister told fellow OPEC members last week that they must combat the U.S. shale oil boom.
"They (OPEC) can get by at $60 a barrel, but that price would knock out a fair whack of the competition - much U.S. shale oil for example - as well as put investment in future capacity growth firmly on the back-burner," ANZ analysts said in a note.
"They're playing the long game, banking that others can't."
Brent hit a low of $67.82 a barrel, the lowest since October 2009, and was down $1.71 at $68.44 a barrel by 0733 GMT. U.S. crude fell $1.49 to $64.66 a barrel, after earlier slipping to an intraday low of $64.10, the lowest since July 2009.
Oil-producing countries from Iraq to Nigeria are revising their 2015 budgets to reflect lower prices.
Iran refrained from protesting against OPEC's decision to retain its production ceiling to maintain group solidarity, even though the move will not benefit all members, Iranian oil minister said in local media reports.
Slower than expected growth in China's manufacturing sector may add further downward pressure on oil. China's official Purchasing Managers' Index ( PMI ) slipped to 50.3 in November, a government study showed on Monday, lower than analysts' forecasts of 50.6.
"It's not too bad a miss, but probably won't help (oil) too much," Ric Spooner, chief analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney said.
"It's best not to try to pick bottoms at this stage."
Spooner said the next support levels for Brent are at $68 and $64 a barrel. If West Texas Intermediate crude futures fall below $63.90 a barrel, the next support level would be at $50, he said.

Action plan to focus on protect cultural landscape of KavvayiUpdated: December 1, 2014 11:49 IST
Action plan to focus on protect cultural landscape of Kavvayi
Staff Reporter
Special Arrangement
A view of Kavvayi wetlands at Payyannur in Kannur.
Initiatives to protect the socio-cultural characteristics of the region, promotion of livelihood through self-help groups, and encouragement of eco-tourism activities form the special focus area in the management action plan prepared by Centre for Water Resources Development and Management (CWRDM) for the Kavvayi wetlands.
A coastal backwater body spread across 10.6 sqkm area, the Kavvayi is one of the major wetland ecosystems in north Kerala.
Spotted with small islands and fed by five different rivers, it stretches from part of Payyannur in Kannur to Neeleswaram in Kasaragod.
The history and cultural activities practiced in the islands were studied in detail for the project by a team of scientists from the CWRDM.
The myriad temples, Nagalayams and Kavus, where the ritual art form of Theyyam takes place every year amidst great fanfare, make these islands culturally unique.
“Protection of the wetland and its islands cannot materialise without properly understanding and taking into account its cultural characteristics,” says P.S. Harikumar, head of the Water Quality Division of CWRD, who led the team.
The action plan prepared by the centre with financial support from the Kerala State Council forScience, Technology and Environment (KSCSTE) has earmarked Rs.1 crore for the conservation of the sacred groves in its Rs.20-crore budget estimate.
Theyyam
Stressing the importance of promoting cultural tourism by methodically marketing Theyyam and other traditional festivals of the region, the budget estimate has also included Rs.90 lakh for it.
Promotion of ecotourism is another area the action plan has set its eye on. The budget estimate, which sought Rs.75 lakh for the promotion of ecotourism, has also envisaged Rs.1.5 crore for various livelihood promotion activities through self-help groups.
Action plan
Stating that the preparation of the action plan was an important step towards including the wetland into the Ramsar list of protected sites, Dr. Harikumar says it is essential that the government takes all measures to protect this wetland without delay.
Third in the State
Kavvayi, the third largest wetland in the State, according to him, is facing severe threats from different quarters. The threats include encroachments, laterite mining, destruction of mangroves, land filling, and other forms of pollution that is causing severe damage to its sensitive ecosystem.
The action plan which has given special focus to the protection of its biodiversity also suggested an institutional method for its management, says Dr. Harikumar.

Rohtak sisters beat up molesters public busRohtak sisters beat up three men who tried to molest them on a public bus
Mail Today –  Mon 1 Dec, 2014
Rohtak :Two college-aged sisters were forced to fight back with a belt after three men harassed them on board a Haryana Roadways bus, while their fellow passengers watched.
The men threw the girls out of the bus, but were later arrested over the incident.
"After our investigation concluded, we arrested three of the accused who will be produced before the court tomorrow," said SHO of Rohtak police station Gajendra Singh.
The episode occurred on Friday when Pooja and Aarti of Thana village - two BSc final year students of Rohtak Government College - were returning home.
The youths, from Rohtak’s Asan village, started making lewd gestures and hurling indecent language.
"One of the goons wrote his phone number on a paper and threw it at us. We told him not to do so. He said they will have to pick it up and accept him."
"The goons followed when the girls even changed their bus. They continued to tease despite a woman passenger objecting."
When the trio crossed all limits, one girl asked them to stop, prompting a goon to push and grab her neck. After noticing that the eve-teaser was pressing her sister’s throat, Pooja removed her belt and became a real “Mardaani”, kicking, punching and beating him up.
The victims said that the goons started hitting them when the bus stopped. However, after being thrown out, one sister threw a brick that hit one of the men as he fled the scene.
Shockingly, the bus crew did not stop the vehicle or help the girls who were thrown out of the vehicle. The driver continued to drive even when the goons were harassing and thrashing the girls. Moreover, the other passengers also remained mute spectators.
The victims even dialled the number of the women’s helpline, but got no response.
One passenger recorded the girls’ fight back on her mobile. After reaching home, the sisters narrated the incident to their parents and subsequently a case was registered at the Rohtak Sadar police station.
The BJP, in its election campaigns, had promised to bring down crimes against women and Dalits but the situation remains the same.
Haryana Women's Commission vice-chairperson Suman Dahiya said: “I will personally visit the place where the incident took place.”

Eye 25% volume growth in Q3: Thangamayli JewelleryThe metal availability was a question for the entire jewellery industry and because of 80:20 scheme it was creating very unhealthy approach of smuggling from neighbouring countries.
Yadindra Kumar
GM Finance
Thangamayil Jewellery
Yadindra Kumar, GM Finance at  Thangamayil Jewellery said with the RBI scrapping the 80:20 rule on gold imports, the availability of gold would improve and also help curb gold smuggling.
 
It would also mean that the procurement costs for gold companies would be lower, he said in an interview to CNBC-TV18.
According to him as a result of this move, the company per se would see a volume growth of 25. Moreover, the upcoming festive season in December would also give a fillip to volumes, he added.
Below is the transcript of Yadindra Kumar's interview with Ekta Batra & Anuj Singhal on CNBC-TV18.
Ekta: Can you detail to us how beneficial the scrapping of the 80:20 scheme would be for Thangamayil Jewellery in specific?
A: We got the circular withdrawing the 80:20 scheme on Friday evening around 6:30 pm. We are getting more details today and by tomorrow we will be getting on how it will be introduced through the system in India. It is a very positive move from the government side.
Ekta: How does it change your procurement model?
A: The metal availability was a question for the entire jewellery industry and because of 80:20 scheme it was creating very unhealthy approach of smuggling from neighbouring countries. It is a great relief now because this makes it more transparent. The direct metal availability will be at ease and that itself will give a great thing. The craftsmen that we had employed, we were not able to give job on daily basis because they could carry on work depending on availability of work.
Ekta: Would your procurement cost reduce because of this?
A: Yes definitely. Procurement cost will be coming down greatly, the price itself has come down by 12 percent as compared to last year and today the 22 carat price is quite low but based on this government policy and metal availability things will get better shape.
Ekta: What would this do to your Profit and Loss (P&L), for example in Q3 FY14 would we see an impact of possibly better margins and profits for the company because of this?
A: Yes, in fact volume uptick itself we are expecting a bare minimum increase of 25 percentage in Q3 and considering Christmas and New Year, it maybe even more than that on the volume front.
Thangamayil stock price
On December 10, 2014, Thangamayil Jewellery  closed at Rs 196.65, down Rs 5.9, or 2.91 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 228.90 and the 52-week low was Rs 105.75.
The latest book value of the company is Rs 111.96 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company was 1.76.

Still no decision on first Australia-India testStill no decision on first Australia-India test
Reuters
India team remain in Adelaide, pending decision
Sydney, Dec 1:  
The fate of the first test between Australia and India remained uncertain on Monday as cricket officials continued to consider their options following the death last week of Australian batsman Phillip Hughes.
The match was supposed to start in Brisbane on Thursday but has been delayed to allow grief-stricken players to attend Hughes' funeral on Wednesday.
The Australian and Indian cricket boards have been meeting with the players' union to work out a solution, but have not made a final decision.
"Please note that no decisions have been made about the first test. We will update once a decision has been made. Thank you for your patience," Cricket Australia said in a statement.
The Indian team, currently in Adelaide, were supposed to fly to Brisbane on Monday but missed their flight, raising speculation that the Brisbane test will either be cancelled altogether or the whole series will be reshuffled.
"The Indian side will remain in Adelaide until details for the first test have been confirmed," CA said.
"A range of scenarios are being looked at. The game could start later this week, be rescheduled for later in summer, or abandoned completely."
Hughes died in a Sydney hospital last Thursday, two days after he was struck in the head by a short-pitched delivery during a domestic first-class match.
His death has triggered an outpouring of emotion, sympathy and support from inside and outside the cricketing world.
"We know that there are many people who have purchased tickets to the test match who will be wondering what happens next," Cricket Australia James Sutherland told the cricket.com.au website on Monday.
"Once the situation has been resolved, we will advise them as a priority. Fans should simply hold onto their tickets until further notice."
The funeral for the left-hander, who would have turned 26 on Sunday, will be held in his hometown of Macksville in northern New South Wales on Wednesday, with the timing of that considered a major determinant in postponing the first test.
Hughes was a popular member of the Australian side and some were playing in the match when he was struck by the ball.
TV rights make an incoming tour by the India test team by far the most lucrative in the world game so cancellation of the Brisbane match is unlikely.
There is precious little room for manoeuvre, however, with the second test scheduled to take place in Adelaide from December 12-16 with the third starting on Boxing Day (December 26) in Melbourne and the fourth in Sydney running from January 3-7.

We aim to deliver better than the best in future: Bata India MD
INDRANI DUTTA

December 1, 2014:  
Bata is easily one of the biggest comeback stories in the retail segment. After a spell of flat topline and depressed bottomline a decade ago, the company, which owns the iconic brand, bounced back improving its footwear collection, upgrading its manufacturing facilities and opening new large format retail outlets while shutting down unviable ones. Its key priorities now include expanding its presence in existing markets while panning out to Tier-II and Tier-III markets.
Rajeev Gopalakrishnan, Group Managing Director, Bata Emerging Markets, Bata India Ltd., shared his views in an email interview to The Hindu.
How did the company achieve this comeback and what sort of competition did it face and in which segments?
Bata has been holding a unique place in the hearts of Indians for more than 83 years. It has redefined the modern footwear industry in India and has established a leadership position in the market and is the most trusted name in branded footwear market.
With a strong historic presence attached to it, it has made sure to touch the lives of Indian consumers, giving them beautiful memories to relate too when reminded of the brand.
Its history is so deep rooted within India that a majority of the Indian population considers it to be a local brand rather than a global brand.
Bata has always lived up to the expectation of its customers and the same has been observed in the product portfolio that is offered with constant customisation. The consumer of today is very well travelled and is conscious of the choices made.
To cater to the same, the brand has always indulged in understanding the need of the customer and customised the product catalogue accordingly.
It’s an era of growing competition but Bata always has its own differential factors of comfort, quality, style, technology and innovation.
Which product segments give the biggest business to the company?
Every business unit at Bata has its own equal contribution towards the growth of the business. It will be difficult to credit one particular category from menswear, womenswear, kidswear and accessories, which provides biggest business to the brand.
What is the game plan behind including accessories in the shops – to what extent is it helping Bata. Is it a global trend for the company?
Accessories have been a part of the offering since a very long time now. However, we have been expanding the catalogue constantly with an objective to create the brand as a one-stop-shop for the customer.
The catalogue for accessories includes bags, belts, wallets, scarves and sunglasses.
Where does Bata India stand vis-a-vis Bata in other countries in respect of business turnover? Is there anything typical of India?
The company had recorded a turnover of over Rs.2,000 crore in the year 2013 reflecting a growth of approximately 12 per cent, as compared to the previous year. The Company’s net profit of Rs.190 crore during the year 2013 also reflected a growth of 11.2 per cent. Bata in India contributes positively to the overall global turnover and is definitely an important part of the business.
How is your plan to close unviable stores and open 100 new ones progressing? Which will be the preferred market?
The retail expansion plans are going smoothly, and we have opened a number of new stores. By and large, we plan to target the high-street shopping areas and malls within the target regions.
A major focus for the times to come is on the Tier-II and III cities. A lot of research and development goes behind identifying the right location for opening a new store.
The stores, which are not performing, are usually substituted by improved stores in the vicinity, to avoid any loss of sales.
Bata has a strong footprint of over 1,400 stores in the country, and the plan is to make the brand even more accessible to its customers by opening more number of outlets.
Local brands like Sree Leathers (a city-based listed company) give you competition using the value for money plank. Do you face similar competition in other regions too? What is Bata’s strategy for tackling this?
Bata has always been known for its value for money products. The product offering at the brand has always been aspirational, comfortable, contemporary and yet affordable. Having competition is always healthy as you get to gear up and learn from the industry trends. The footwear market is only growing and we are confident on our performance in times ahead. We are always working towards the customisation of our products to cater to the emerging needs of our customers while focusing on maintaining high quality and comfort.
How is your franchise model which you had mentioned at your AGM, unfolding…you had planned 100 rural stores in two years, starting with 20 pilots?
The franchise model is still in the pilot test phase. We will keep you informed as the project progresses.
How are you planning to scale up your e-commerce business?
The e-commerce retail for Bata is only growing as we talk. We are constantly upgrading our website with wider range of offering as well as retailing curated edits of products on the leading fashion and lifestyle portals in the country. Bata promotes its e-commerce business with constant promotional/festive offers that encourage shoppers to buy from the Bata online. A timely delivery and a robust customer care unit is trained to back the e-commerce business.
What is the way forward? What are your projections and what are your views on imports from China? Is that an option for you?
The objective of the brand has always been to deliver the contemporary and aspirational range of products to the consumers at a high quality and affordable value. It gives us immense pleasure to welcome new consumers and loyal customers at our stores and offer an enriching experience with great customer service. We aim to deliver better than the best in future as well. A greater percentage of our products are locally manufactured in five factories across the country. An additional objective of focussing on local development and sourcing is to provide employment and training to our own country men and women.

FM hints at changing tax laws to check evasionFM Arun Jaitley for friendly taxes to discourage evasion
Mail Today Bureau     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 28, 2014  | 16:15 IST
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley (Photo: PTI)
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday said tax rates should be brought down to reasonable levels to get rid of rampant instances of evasion and to improve the environment for investments.
"Our tax system has to be friendly for tax payers and that is what we are trying to do step-by-step," Jaitley said in the Lok Sabha during a debate on black money.
Advocating a tax structure which discourages evasion, he said there was a misconception that high tax rates lead to higher revenues.
"High tax rates do not necessarily mean more revenue collection... direct and indirect tax rates have to be brought to reasonable levels so that the basket increases and there is no incentive for tax evasion," Jaitley said. The minister added there was a time when India had very high tax rates, and the country's growth rate was mocked as 'Hindu rate of growth'.
Referring to steps being taken by the cen- tral government to unearth and bring black money stashed abroad, Jaitley said the government has identified 427 account holders associated with the HSBC list and efforts are on to complete tax assessment by March 31, 2015. He also said that prose- cution has already been launched in several cases while the cases would be filed every week, and names would be made public.
"When the media comes to know (names of black money holders), it will note that there are influential people in the list (of foreign account holders)," Jaitley said. Members of the Congress and the Trinamool Congress, however, were not sat- isfied with the finance minister's assur- ance and staged a walkout.
Asserting that the government would have to move carefully, he said that those pushing for immediate disclosure of names would be indirectly helping black money account holders as the latter would be alerted.
"Some account holders have already withdrawn money (from offshore illegal accounts)... We necessarily do not need to show bravado and adventurism," he told Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav who wanted to know if money was still deposited in accounts abroad after reports of withdrawal of money from about 18 illegal accounts in Liechtenstein. Jaitley said,
"In the last few years, as an economy, we got a bad name from the world of investment for not being a tax- friendly regime." While giving an overview about treaties India has signed with various countries to deal with the black money, the finance minister hinted at changing laws as he accepted weaknesses in them. "I admit that there is a weak- ness in law. If the black money stashed abroad has to come, how will it come? Even the SIT is worried about this," Jaitley said, while answering a question on how soon could the black money be brought back.
Meanwhile in the Rajya Sabha, the government allayed apprehensions over continuance or dilution of MNREGA scheme launched by the previous UPA government, and said all necessary funds had already been released for the welfare scheme.
"There is no ambiguity about the government's intention. The scheme will continue in all the 6,500 blocks," Rural Development Minister Birender Singh said.

Big challenge for small-town IIMs  IITs: Retaining faculty  connectivityComments
If connectivity is ever considered a top criterion for selecting sites to set up new IITs and IIMs, those in the pipeline will miss the bus.
The squabbling over a suitable site in Odisha following the NDA government’s decision to open five new IITs and an equal number of IIMs has sparked a debate over location because some such national institutes that came up between 2009 and 2011 in small towns were apparently struggling to find and retain good faculty and arrange logistics.
Most of these are located in towns which aren’t connected to good road or rail networks, let alone airports. The nearest airport for Kashipur in Uttarakhand, which has the youngest IIM, is 70km away at Pantnagar. The town has only two daily trains connecting Delhi, about 200km away.
“Getting faculty and companies to visit us is a challenge. Companies need enormous persuasion to visit campuses of new IIMs, especially those at unfavourable locations,” said Gautum Sinha, the director of IIM Kashipur.
IIM Trichy in Tamil Nadu has a similar problem because there are fewer domestic flights from the town than those to Singapore and Sri Lanka.
Mandi in Himachal Pradesh, the site for a new IIT, doesn’t even have a direct train from any major city. Chandigarh, 185km by road, is the nearest railhead and airport.
Gautam Biswas, the director of IIT Guwahati that was established in 1994, said the institute has struggled to attract faculty because no night flight operates from the airport in the Northeast’s main city. “There is seldom a flight from Guwahati after 7pm. Flights (at night) to Delhi and Mumbai are needed.”
For IIT Ropar in Punjab, some member of its staff is always travelling to Chandigarh and New Delhi to either procure equipment or for mundane maintenance tasks.
MK Surappa, the institute’s director, said lack of good schools, hospitals or jobs for spouses in the town have been prompting most of the faculty members to avoid permanent postings.
The institute had 38 vacant teaching positions out of 90 sanctioned posts, according to figures in 2013. “Sometimes teachers quit in the middle of the session,” Surappa said.
The absence of good hotels and campus accommodations are also keeping visiting lecturers away from many such institutes. “Arranging accommodation for faculty from abroad is a problem because there is hardly any good facility here. Most of the new IIMs are still functioning from temporary campuses, which may also deter recruiters,” said P Rameshan, the director of IIM Rohtak.
IIT Bhubaneswar has started offering 30% more pay than the older IITs to plug the faculty drain, while Kanpur has virtual lectures to make up for the shortage. But those in favour of a network of IITs and IIMs attribute the faculty crunch to teaching generally losing its attraction as a sought-after profession. They said institutes located even in the remotest town could bring companies for placement through good public relations.
Sudhir Jain, the director of IIT Gandhinagar gave perspective to the debate: “All institutes have teething problems and these are being overcome.”

Dutch officials said on Sunday bird flu had been found at another poultry farm in the Netherlands, the fourth in recent weeks.
The Economics Ministry said the farm's 28,000 birds were being destroyed. It said the flu infection was of the same H5 variety found at farms across Europe and Asia in recent months. It was not yet clear how infectious the strain was, the Ministry said.
A ban on transporting poultry products has been imposed and the four other farms within that radius are being inspected for signs of bird flu, the Ministry said.

Bill Replacing Coal Ordinance to be Brought in Parliament This Week
Press Trust of India | Updated On: November 30, 2014 20:22 (IST)
Court Refuses to Let Off Hindalco in Coal Block Case
New Delhi: A Bill seeking to replace the coal blocks allocation Ordinance that unveiled the NDA government's ambitious coal sector reforms will be brought in Parliament this week.
Introduction as well as consideration and passage of two Bills to replace Ordinances pertaining to coal blocks allocation and textile undertakings is on the government agenda this week.
The coal blocks allocation Ordinance was brought in the wake of the Supreme Court decision cancelling 214 coal blocks in September.
The government promulgated the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Ordinance, 2014 in October to facilitate auctioning of the cancelled coal blocks.
Incidentally, the coal Ordinance has been opposed by the central trade unions. BMS as also AITUC, CITU, HMS and INTUC have jointly opposed the government's proposal to allow private players to mine coal and sell it in the open market, a right till now reserved with the state-owned Coal India Limited (CIL).
The Bill seeking to replace the Textile Undertakings (Nationalisation) Laws (Amendment and Validation) Ordinance, 2014 is being introduced in Lok Sabha on Monday and will also be moved for consideration immediately thereafter.
The Ordinance was brought to shield the National Textile Corporation from rent control laws that have been used to evict its sick textile units from prime land in several cities.

Coal India Executives Seek PM Intervention for Performance Related PayNew Delhi: Coal India executives have sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi's intervention for implementation of performance related pay (PRP) for nearly 19,000 officers of the world's largest miner.
The issue has been pending for long despite a high-level panel recommending its implementation.
Executives in March had called off a three-day strike after the first day as they received assurances from CIL management in this regard.
"We solicit your intervention with a high hope considering your reputation and image all over the world for fast and timely decision making so that a genuine case which unfortunately got so delayed does not suffer any more," Coal Mines Officers' Association of India (CMOAI) said in a letter to the Prime Minister.
CMOAI Secretary General P K Singh said PRP is a part of pay implemented since January 1, 2007 and has been paid to all executives of other entitled PSUs, barring Coal India (CIL).
"The Committee of Secretaries (CoS) has recommended the PRP proposal of CIL on March 12, but it was kept pending due to code of conduct during Parliamentary election."
"After the formation of new government, a Cabinet note placed by the Ministry of Coal for final approval is still pending," Mr Singh said in the letter.
Despite categorical assurance by CIL chairman on March 13 after consultation with the Coal Ministry that final approval of the Cabinet will be obtained with 2-6 weeks, the issue is yet to be resolved even after eight months, he added.
"Seventy five per cent of the payable amount has been paid to CIL executives for four years in 2012 but due to non-finalisation of the same, it is getting deducted from the retired/widows of deceased executives which is highly inhuman and painful," the letter said.
Earlier, the Coal Ministry had sought comments from various ministries, including the Finance Ministry, on the draft Cabinet note for implementation of PRP of CIL employees.
The government had earlier floated a draft note to seek the approval of the Cabinet for permitting loss-making and marginally profit-making subsidiaries of CIL to adopt 2007 pay revision as an exception to the prescribed affordability clause and payment of performance related pay to the executives of all subsidiaries of CIL.

City crush Southampton 3-0  ascend to 2nd spotBy: Reuters | London |
Posted: November 30, 2014 10:15 pm | Updated: December 1, 2014 12:58 pm
Champions Manchester City galvanised their pursuit of Premier League leaders Chelsea on Sunday with an emphatic 3-0 victory over a Southampton side who have surprisingly come between the leading title protagonists.
With table-topping Chelsea held to a 0-0 draw against Sunderland on Saturday, victory for City at fortress St Mary’s took them above Southampton into second place with 27 points from 13 matches, six behind Jose Mourinho’s pace setters.
After a less than convincing start to the attempted defence of their title, City’s display against Southampton saw them back to their free-flowing best as goals from Yaya Toure, Frank Lampard and Gael Clichy condemned Ronald Koeman’s high-flying side to a first home defeat of the season.
“We beat a very good team,” City manager Manuel Pellegrini, speaking to Sky Sports, said. “They were second in the table and deserved that position.
“It was important to have a clean sheet again, they had just one chance in the 90 minutes and that is important for the trust in our team.
“It was close in the first 45 minutes and we continued working as a team in defence and attack until we scored.”
City screamed for a penalty for a foul on Aguero in a goalless first half when Jose Fonte’s hefty challenge wiped the Argentine out in the box. Incredibly Aguero, making his 100th Premier League appearance, was booked for diving.
But Ivorian midfielder Toure, so often City’s go-to man on their way to the title last season, put his side in front after 51 minutes when his low shot from the edge of the area flicked off Saints defender Toby Alderweireld and past Fraser Forster.
When French defender Eliaquim Mangala received a second yellow for a foul on Shane Long it seemed Southampton had a lifeline but that was snatched away when Lampard ghosted through into space and buried his shot low into the corner after being picked out by James Milner.
Clichy hammered the final nail into Southampton’s coffin when he turned the ball home in the 88th minute.
“I’m disappointed because in the second half the beginning was a bit better than the start of the game,” Koeman told Sky Sports after his side dropped to third.
“You know that if you do some mistakes you are punished for that. It was not good enough today and we have to realise that. The difference was the quality.”

Ensure relief for victims of mishaps  crimes: Supreme CourtWritten by Utkarsh Anand | New Delhi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 2:07 am
Victims of crimes and their families can look forward to a helping hand from the government to put the agonising memories behind them and be able to start life afresh.
The Supreme Court has directed all states and Union Territories to implement without delay the scheme meant to compensate injured victims and families of those killed in crimes.
The governments are obligated to disburse compensation under Section 357A of the Code of Criminal Procedure whereby a court can issue such orders to help victims of crime rehabilitate.
A bench of Justices V Gopala Gowda and Adarsh Kumar Goel said there was a benevolent purpose behind having such a legal provision and that it could not be allowed to frustrate due to ignorance or indifference on the part of the courts or of the authorities concerned.
“It has been brought to our notice that even though almost a period of five years has expired since the enactment of Section 357A, the award of compensation has not become a rule and interim compensation, which is very important, is not being granted by the courts,” it said.
It asserted that a duty was cast upon the courts “to takes cognizance of a criminal offence, to ascertain whether there is tangible material to show commission of crime, whether the victim is identifiable and whether the victim of crime needs immediate financial relief.”
In all such cases, the court should direct the government to pay compensation, which could be as an interim measure to begin with, subject to final outcome of the case. “Gravity of offence and need of victim are some of the guiding factors to be kept in mind, apart from such other factors as may be found relevant in the facts and circumstances of an individual case,” said the bench.
The court was informed by Additional Solicitor General L N Rao that 25 out of 29 state governments had notified victim compensation schemes. The bench ordered the remaining four states, namely Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Meghalaya and Telangana to notify their schemes within one month. It also ordered all the states to place additional funds at disposal of the Legal Services Authorities.
The court further regretted that the upper limit of compensation fixed by some of the states was “arbitrarily low and not in keeping with the object of the legislation”, and held there was a need to consider upward revision in the scale for compensation to meet the current cost of living index.
The bench said that till such decisions are taken by the governments, the scale notified by the Kerala government could meet the purpose. Under the Kerala Victim Compensation Scheme that was notified by the state government in February, the compensation for death due to crime is Rs 5 lakh, and that for rape victims and culpable homicide not amounting to murder is at least Rs 3 lakh.

Bangladesh stands to gain some 10,000 acres of land through this deal the UPA government had initiated in 2011 and placed as a bill for ratification in Rajya Sabha in December last year. The BJP in Assam had opposed this deal, as did the Trinamool Congress in West Bengal.
Addressing party workers in Guwahati on Sunday, Modi said, “The land swap deal will be beneficial. It might seem to be an immediate loss for Assam, but it will serve security interests in the long term and help solve the problem of Bangladeshi migrants.”
Infiltration from Bangladesh is a major issue in the Northeast. It is viewed as a demographic invasion designed to out-populate scores of indigenous communities in the region.
 
The Prime Minister said there would be no compromise with the security of the strategic Northeast. “The forces trying to destabilise Assam and the Northeast should know that Delhi has a new government and the law will not spare them now,” he said.
Insisting that the BJP brand of politics was not based on casteism, communalism or regionalism, Modi said his party believes in nationalism. “Our mantra of inclusive development has compelled all political parties to rework their agendas,” he said, adding that his government has special plans for the Northeast.

Bird flu under control in Kerala  1.80 lakh birds culledWritten by Shaju Philip | Thiruvananthapuram |
Posted: December 1, 2014 10:25 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 2:25 pm
Kerala government said the avian influenza which had hit the duck-rearing Central Kerala’s Kuttanad region has been brought under control. So far, 1.80 lakh ducks have been culled and the operation would be wound up on Monday with culling of another batch of 50,000 poultry.
Health Minister V S Shivakumar said the virus which was identified as H5N1 has not hit humans so far. Six samples were collected from persons with symptoms of avian flu, but all of them were negative. However, the government has equipped the hospitals in Alappuzha to face the situation if humans were found affected with H5N1. The health department t has put under observation around 3 lakh persons and visited 80,000 households in the affected areas, said the minister.
Although duck deaths have been reports from many part of Central Kerala, tests showed they were not due to avian influenza. The government has decided to extent the financial assistance to the duck farmers who had lost their bird even before the avian influenza was confirmed.

Centre to extend Direct Benefit Transfer scheme to MGNREGA
ET Bureau Dec 1, 2014, 04.48AM IST

AADHAAR
(Jaitley has approved the…)
NEW DELHI: The central government plans to soon extend the direct benefit transfer (DBT) programme to the beneficiaries of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act as well as seven higher scholarship schemes.
Finance minister Arun Jaitley has approved the proposal to extend wages under the flagship rural jobs programme through the DBT platform and a final notification is expected shortly, a senior government official involved in the exercise told ET.
The move to expand the programme comes days after the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance government at the Centre launched the modified DBT-L or direct benefit transfer of LPG subsidy in 54 districts on November 15, which will be in addition to the 27 schemes already covered under the mechanism. "We will use DBT for extending wages under MGNREGA in the select 300 districts in the first phase. Besides, seven more scholarship schemes will be added to the list of social sector benefits being routed directly in the bank accounts of the beneficiaries using the DBT platform as Prime Minister Narendra Modi is keen to speed up the rollout of DBT across schemes to minimise leakages," the official said, requesting anonymity.
A massive verification drive undertaken by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) under the supervision of the Planning Commission in 300 identified districts, where enrolment is more than 80%, has shown that 10-12% of the beneficiaries are ghost beneficiaries, resulting in huge misappropriation of planned funds of the government to non-eligible and even non-existing beneficiaries.
Official estimates suggest that if this is taken up on a massive scale at the national level, the government may end up saving at leastRs 10,000 crore annually.
A large proportion of wages under rural jobs scheme is already transferred to the bank accounts of beneficiaries. However, many of these accounts are believed to be fake and the government hopes that linking the jobs programme with the unique Aadhaar number allotted by UIDAI will enable biometric verification of the actual beneficiary and prevent leakages in the system. The NDA government, which took charge in May, has brought forward the target for universal coverage of Aadhaar by March 2015.
Started by the previous UPA government in January 2013, DBT covers 121 districts and has 27 schemes in its fold, including scholarships (17), pensions (three), motherhood (two) and child development. This was followed by the launch of DBT-L in June last year but the government had to withdraw it within a few weeks because of process-related issues.

India Post Collects Over Rs 280 Crore via Cash on Delivery for E-Tailers: ReportMotherson Sumi's German Acquisition to Be EPS Accretive
New Delhi: Within a year of joining the e-commerce bandwagon as a distribution channel, India Post has transacted business worth Rs 280 crore in the cash on delivery (CoD) segment alone for firms like Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon.
While the amount of revenue generated for itself could not be ascertained, government officials said India Post is very keen on developing its e-commerce related services as a major revenue model going ahead.
"India Post collected over Rs 280 crore from consumers and gave it to e-commerce firms, since CoD facility was started in December 2013. The department with its huge network can serve as the best agency for not just delivering products, but also collecting money," a government official said.
However, this is a small chunk of the overall market size for e-commerce in India, which runs into billions of dollars already and is growing at a fast pace every year.
CoD has emerged as one of the most sought after services for e-commerce entities and 50-75 per cent of orders are placed with various online retailers with this payment option, while the remaining opt for credit card or bank payments.
In India, customers tend to prefer CoD as the online payment modes are yet to catch up in many parts of the country while many people are not comfortable with advance payments for products purchased online.
The government entity's cash handling services like core banking solutions, money transfer and a robust account system can further help e-commerce firms in collecting cash from users in urban as well as rural areas, the official said.
India Post has about 1.55 lakh post offices, making it the world's largest postal network. On an average, a post office serves 21.21 sq km area and about 7,175 people.
Another official said various e-commerce firms have been using India Posts CoD facility since it was introduced. Firms like Flipkart, Snapdeal, Amazon, Shopclues, Naaptol, Telebrands and Homeshop18 are some of them.
India Post has set up booking counters in the premises of some customers like Amazon and Naaptol, while for Snapdeal it is exploring setting up of e-commerce booking kiosks in post office locations.
Communications and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has also said previously that India Post is best suited to offer delivery services to e-commerce players, given its wide reach across rural, urban and semi-urban areas.
The minister has directed officials from the Department of Posts to focus on opportunities in e-commerce sector. India Post is also ramping up its infrastructure to grab a major chunk of the distribution, delivery or logistics, which will touch about $9 billion by 2021.
According to market experts, e-commerce business in India was about $6 billion in value in 2012 and is expected to touch $76 billion by 2021 of which distribution, delivery and logistics constitutes around 12 per cent.

("The recent unveiling of…)
Geoff Lewis, executive director and global market strategist at JPMorgan AMC, has said the government policy reforms tabled so far have not been surprising, but rather they appear to be many small steps in the right direction. The introduction of new projects and return of Indian entrepreneurs' animal spirits will take time before showing more visible effect. Edited excerpts from an interview with ET..
How do you think the Bank of Japan's stimulus announcement and European Central Bank's (ECB) likely quantitative easing will aid emerging markets' equity performance?
The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan must continue to expand their balance sheets to fight deflationary pressures.
Despite some increase in volatility, overall global liquidity for markets should remain flush. In emerging markets, we continue to expect an uncomfortable period of adjustment in 2015 relating to recent rapid build-up in debt together with strengthening of the US dollar.
The US Federal Reserve prepares to hike rates next year. How do you think this will impact global financial markets?
While the US continues to normalise its monetary policies, the key implications are --stronger US dollar, continued weakness in global commodity prices, and looser monetary conditions globally. We expect very gradual and cautious raising of short-term US interest rates by the Federal Reserve in the second half of 2014. We believe that the impact on markets when it happens will be more benign than many investors are currently fearing.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has completed over 6 months in his office. How do you rate the performance of new government against expectations?
One of the most crucial issues for Modi's government has been the reforms necessary to stem major issues the country is currently facing - raising economic growth from multi-year lows, taming inflation, and getting spiralling deficits under control. And Modi seems to have taken long-term view on solving these issues, considering that he has at least one full term of around 5 years and quite likely the second to push forward his plans. So far, the reforms tabled have not been surprising, but rather they appear to be many small steps in right direction that in sum are likely to have a material impact over a period of time.
What is your view on government reform policies, and do you think they are right enough to bring back India's economic growth back on track?
The recent unveiling of the 'Make in India' campaign aimed at attracting business to set up manufacturing in India will hopefully add to the positive investment climate.
Modinomics will only succeed in the longer term if it can galvanise the private sector.
Government policies alone will not be enough to restore GDP growth to 6.5% or higher. The recent uptick in capex is a good sign while the introduction of new projects and the return of Indian entrepreneurs' animal spirits will take time before having a more visible effect. A GDP growth rate close to 7% should be possible for India over the medium term.
  How do you think easing global commodity prices can boost India's prospects for faster economic growth?
The cheaper oil prices have been in particular a boon for Modi, who reassuringly took the opportunity provided to deregulate the retail diesel price and streamline various fuel subsides. These cuts will also help the Modi government in its attempt to reach the fiscal deficit target of around 4% of GDP. More rapid progress in defeating inflation will help bring forward the timing of monetary easing and interest rate cuts.
RBI has expressed to break the back of inflation before considering monetary policy decisions. What is your outlook on interest rates scenario?
Inflation has now fallen below RBI's 6% target for January 2016, causing some speculation of a rate cut in the near future, possibly even at the December meeting. We would not expect the first interest rate cut to come from RBI until February. However, we also recognise that with inflation having fallen so quickly, there will be growing impatience within some parts of the new government to see the benefits of rate cut. RBI may come under growing political pressure the longer it holds out while FIIs will not wish to see any major rift on monetary policy between the Modi administration and India's central bank.
What are your earnings growth expectations?
There has so far been little sign of pick-up in consensus earnings, but we believe that we are getting closer to a major inflection point for earnings. Over the medium term, a compounded growth (CAGR) of 15-18% for Indian equity markets should be achievable if Modi's programme to raise potential growth is a success.
What's your biggest concern about Indian markets?
In the short term , the rather disappointing earnings season YTD, and investor impatience over the speed of cyclical recovery or with the progress of Modinomics might become the trigger for more significant locally-driven market correction than in October. Such a market correction would offer investors who are late to India story a good entry point as we believe that the next big theme for the Indian equity market is likely to be a strong domestically-led secular recovery in earnings.
What are your economic growth expectations for FY16?
Six percent appears conservative as forecast for GDP growth in CY2015 as many sell-side brokers have pencilled in a figure that is closer to 7% than 6%. If all goes well, then 6.5% is possible, but we would caution against investors looking for an early return to higher growth path without the prior implementation of supply-side reforms and visible improvement in trend productivity.

Shiv Sena leaders meet CM Fadnavis over joining govt inMaharashtraBy: Express News Service | Mumbai |

Shiv Sena leaders on late Sunday evening met Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, raising the possibility of Sena joining the BJP-led government in the state.
Sources said that Sena has shown inclination to climb down from its hard bargaining, and in return the BJP is willing to offer Sena plum portfolios including ministeries of energy, PWD, water  resources, health and social justice.
With some issues still remaining unresolved, there is a likelihood of another meeting between the leaders of the two parties on Monday.
The BJP, which has 121 MLAs in the House, needs support of the Sena’s 63 MLAs for the stability of its government. According to sources in the BJP, they are ready to offer more ministeries to the Sena at the Centre as part of the deal.

Late-night snacks may damagememoryPosted: December 1, 2014 11:27 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 11:30 am
Late-night meals may interfere with your memory, a new study has warned.
The study in mice found that eating during times of day when one would normally be sleeping impaired the animals’ memory for objects they had seen, even when the rats got the same amount of sleep as mice on a normal eating and sleeping schedule.
Study co-author Christopher Colwell, of the University of California, Los Angeles, and a team of researchers acclimatised mice to a normal sleep schedule, sleeping during the day. Mice are nocturnal, so they are normally awake at night and asleep during the day.
Then, the researchers allowed some of the animals to eat only during the time they were typically asleep, while allowing others to eat when the animals would normally be awake, ‘LiveScience’ reported.
The mice on the misaligned eating schedule had shifted sleep times, but they still slept for the same total amount of time, ate the same amount of food and weighed the same as the mice that ate at normal times, Colwell said.
The researchers then tested the mice’s memory. In one experiment, they put the mice in a box with two different objects, and allowed them to explore.
Then, after putting the animals on different feeding schedules, the researchers placed them in the box with one of the familiar objects and one new object, and measured how long the mice spent exploring each one.
Compared with the mice on the aligned eating schedule, the misaligned mice showed a significant decline in memory.
The animals on the altered feeding and sleep schedule spent more time exploring the familiar object, suggesting they didn’t remember encountering the object before
In a second experiment, the researchers conditioned both groups of mice to feel fear in a certain location, and later put them back in that location to see if they showed fear.
The mice on the shifted eating schedule froze less often in the fearful situation than their normal-schedule peers, suggesting the odd eating and sleeping schedule affected the animals’ memory of scary situations.
The researchers also found that the mice that ate during normal sleeping periods learned less quickly than the mice that ate at normal times.
The study was presented at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience in Washington, DC.

Investor not on board  SpiceJet delays salariesInvestor not on board, SpiceJet delays salaries

Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: The crisis at SpiceJet has deepened with the low-cost carrier (LCC) for the first time ever delaying salary payment to its 5,000-odd employees. Also, the airline will continue running its truncated schedule with a large number of flights cancelled. The management's claim of restoring some of the cancelled flights by November-end did not materialize due to the promoter's failure to find an investor for the cash-strapped airline.
SpiceJet COO Sanjiv Kapoor wrote to employees on Saturday night, saying: "For certain technical reasons that cannot be described in an email (but related to ongoing restructuring, recapitalization, and balance-sheet clean-up related activities), salaries are delayed approx one to three working days, depending on pay grade.... While we tried our best to avoid it, this is the first time ever that there has been any delay in salaries at SpiceJet. This will also be the last time salaries will be delayed at SpiceJet."
While passengers have been upset at being informed of flight cancellations at the last minute and being left in the lurch, employees are also a worried lot with the delay in salary payment.
The LCC has seen almost a dozen of its Boeing 737s being taken back by leasors in the past few weeks, due to which it has cut a large number of flights — the airline puts the number at over 50. "There is not much the management can do. The LCC needs infusion of funds. The promoter, Sun Group chief Kalanithi Maran, has not been able to get an investor to put in the money. Hence, the difficulties," said a source.
According to Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation, SpiceJet needs $250 million, about Rs 1,500 crore, funding to stabilize operations with about Rs 1,000 crore immediately required.
Vijay Mallya's Kingfisher Airlines had delayed salary payments and cut flights before it eventually stopped flying in October 2012.
"The SpiceJet management and promoters keep telling us that investor is on the way, while nothing is happening on that front. We can only check that aircraft are fully safe to fly and that the airline is not cutting corners there. But, we don't want to do another Kingfisher as that causes a lot of pain," said an official.
The UPA, too, had faced the same dilemma with Kingfisher. Mallya's airline stopped flying when employees revolted against months of delayed salary payment.
According to CAPA, SpiceJet needs about Rs 1,500-crore funding to stabilize operations with about Rs 1,000 crore required immediately.

Trinamool set to hit back at Amit Shah in Kolkata rallyComments
Trinamool Congress on Monday launched an offensive on the Bharatiya Janata Party in Parliament and held a rally in Kolkata to counter the saffron party president Amit Shah's criticism of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Sunday.
Facing heat over the Saradha scam, Trinamool targeted the BJP inside as well as outside Parliament by alleging that a diary of jailed Sahara group chief Subrata Roy contained the name of a senior leader of the saffron party, leading to clashes and a walkout.
Placard-wielding Trinamool MPs held a demonstration outside Parliament demanding a probe into alleged links between Shah and the Sahara money laundering case.
Trinamool sought to corner the ruling party in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha by displaying symbolic red diaries.
The Trinamool members alleged the diary was recovered from Sahara chief Subrata Roy by the Central Bureau of Investigation during searches at Sahara's office and claimed it contained the name of a BJP leader.
Attack in Parliament
In Lok Sabha, Trinamool MPs rushed to the Well shouting slogans, carrying red-coloured diaries which had "Sahara" written on it. They demanded that PM Modi should explain what action the CBI has taken after the name allegedly figured in the diary. They later staged a walkout.
Bandyopadhyay had given a notice for suspension of Question Hour to discuss the issue which was rejected by Speaker Sumitra Mahajan.
"They (Trinamool MPs) have decided not to follow the rules," she said.
Parliamentary affairs minister M Venkaiah Naidu said according to rules no member can name anyone who is not a member of the House. They also cannot display placards, he said.
To this, the Speaker said the name of the BJP leader would not go on record.
After protesting for a few minutes, the Trinamool MPs staged a walkout.
Minister of state for home affairs Kiren Rijiju, however, denied the presence of the "red diary".
"These are political allegations. There is no truth in it. No such diary was recovered," Rijiju told reporters in Delhi.
Later, BJP member Kirit Somaiya hit back, alleging that the Trinamool government in West Bengal was creating "hurdles" in the CBI investigation into the Saradha chit fund scam, in which names of "one dozen" Trinamool leaders have cropped up.
This led to protests by Trinamool members but Somaiya went on saying that 3.5 lakh small investors had been cheated in the chit fund scheme.
"The state government is not cooperating with the CBI probe," he alleged.
Amid noisy scenes, the Speaker adjourned the House for lunch, ahead of schedule.
In Rajya Sabha, Trinamool's Derek O'Brien sought to raise the issue during Zero Hour and Question Hour but was disallowed.
He had earlier given a notice for suspension of Question Hour but was not allowed.
As O'Brien rose to raise the issue during Question Hour, BJP members shouted him down by raising the issue of Saradha chit fund scam.
The members flashed symbolic red diaries with Sahara written on them, and tried to storm the well of the upper house as well to press their demand.
Trinamool members later staged a walkout as they were disallowed from raising the issue.
Counter-rally in Kolkata
Mamata Banerjee's nephew and Diamond Harbour Lok Sabha MP, Abhisekh Banerjee, said the West Bengal chief minister does not want to respond to Shah as she believes "he is not of her stature".
Mamata cancelled an appearance at the rally held by Abhishek to counter Shah's allegations levelled against her by Shah.
Speaking almost from the same spot where Shah delivered his Sunday speech, Abhisekh attacked the BJP and PM Modi saying he has done nothing for West Bengal after coming to power.
Abhisekh mocked Modi by comparing him with his aunt saying while he flies in private jets, goes abroad and changes wardrobe frequently, Mamata stays in a small house, wears handloom sarees and chappals.
Without naming Shah, he said those who come to Bengal like migratory birds, address a rally and return to Delhi will not win elections in the state.
Abhisekh also alleged Union minister of law and justice Sadanand Gowda's assets jumped from Rs. 9 crore to Rs. 20 crore in three months, and BJP must explain it.
Shah on Sunday had sounded the poll bugle to oust Trinamool from the state in the 2015 Kolkata Municipal Corporation and 2016 assembly elections and called for a Trinamool-free Bengal.
The BJP's rise in Bengal has sparked speculations about new equations in the state's political arena where the saffron brigade was only a fringe player until recently.
However, banking on Modi's poll promises on development, the party bagged an impressive 16.8% vote share in the April-May Lok Sabha elections. Even though the BJP won just two of the 42 seats, it made an impact.
Frequent clashes between BJP and Trinamool supporters have been reported in West Bengal since the polls.
The BJP chief's address came at a time when the ruling Trinamool is reeling under graft allegations in the multi-crore Saradha chit fund scam and the Burdwan blasts on October 2 that killed two alleged militants from Bangladesh.
Addressing the rally that saw a crowd of two lakh people, Shah had attacked Banerjee over the Saradha case, terrorist activities as well as lack of development in the state.
The TMC on Sunday had refused to attach much importance to Shah's rally and described it as a 'grand flop show'.
The city police, West Bengal fire department and the Kolkata Municipal Corporation had denied permission for the event at the Victoria House, where the ruling Trinamool usually organises its annual martyrs' day rally.
An intervention by the Calcutta high court saw the BJP getting the nod only at the eleventh hour.

Benedict Cumberbatch wont quit SherlockPosted: December 1, 2014 11:59 am
Actor Benedict Cumberbatch says he cannot ever see himself quitting his role as Sherlock Holmes in ‘Sherlock’.
The 38-year-old British actor plays the titular role in the TV series and insists that while he has carved out a career in Hollywood, he isn’t ready to turn his back on the programme because he loves playing the detective so much, reported Contactmusic.
“If we can keep the quality up, I can’t imagine that I will ever get tired of being Sherlock. I’d love to play him as an old man,” Cumberbatch said. “I really, really love my job. I love sets. I love crews. I love theatres. I love audiences,” he added.

New Zealand name Kane Williamson as skipper for One-Dayers againstPakistanBy: Agence-France Presse | Wellington |
Posted: December 1, 2014 11:57 am
New Zealand on Monday named batsman Kane Williamson as stand-in captain for the upcoming limited overs series against Pakistan, allowing regular skipper Brendon McCullum to take a break.
The move confirmed Williamson’s status as McCullum’s long-term successor, with chief selector Bruce Edgar saying it would give the 24-year-old valuable experience in charge for five one-dayers and two T20 matches to be played in the United Arab Emirates.
Edgar said McCullum, along with pacemen Tim Southee and Trent Boult, would return to New Zealand to prepare for a series against Sri Lanka beginning on December 26.
“Managing players’ workloads will be an important part of our summer’s plans and this is simply an example of that,” he said, stressing that the decision to rest the trio was taken before last week’s death of Australian batsman Phillip Hughes, which rocked the entire team.
“On the flip side, it gives us a chance to assess and evaluate other players in contention for the World Cup squad, and allows us to work on some of our contingency plans — such as developing Kane’s captaincy experience.”
McCullum scored a double century as he led New Zealand to a resounding innings and 80 run victory over Pakistan to level a three-match Test series 1-1 on Sunday but said after the match that Hughes’ death had overshadowed the win.
Hughes, 25, died on Thursday, two days after being struck by a bouncer while playing a domestic game at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

Karnataka minister Krishna Byre Gowda turns butt of joke for ‘busy day’ tweet

(“Sorry, Mr Gowda, but…)
BANGALORE: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and most of his cabinet pride themselves on working extended hours, but is it such a big deal? It isn't, if you ask a Karnataka minister, who tweeted his "packed schedule" for Sunday, which, incidentally, involves attending wedding receptions.
Karnataka's minister of state for agriculture Krishna Byre Gowda , who is a part of Rahul Gandhi's inner circle, tweeted on Sunday morning: "Many people ask me, 'Do you work over the weekends !?' So, below is my schedule this weekend." He followed this up with another one, "All these in addition to attending to extra people who walk into my off during weekend mornings!"
Twitterati were quick to tear into Gowda for his "packed schedule that includes several functions to mark Rajyotsava, the state's foundation day, which is celebrated all through the month of November. It also includes his attending four wedding receptions in the evening.
"Sorry, Mr Gowda, but when did attending wedding reception became part of work?," came a reply by one of his Twitter followers.
Gowda's friends and supporters pointed out that he was only showing people that his schedule was as packed as any 'workaholic' minister in the Modi cabinet. "If Modi or his ministers state that they are very busy, does anyone question them? Our ministers are equally hard-working, it is just that they don't talk about it," a close friend of Gowda, who declined to be identified, told ET.
"This is an imitation of the West. In India, we never think weekends are important or for things to enjoy otherwise. It is corporatisation of politics," analyst Harish Ramaswamy told ET.
Ramaswamy said the earlier generation of politicians like Indira Gandhi hardly slept for three hours a day and worked through inhuman schedules without talking about it. "Never did they make a fuss about weekends. Every day is very important in politics. Even in the little free time that they had, they did not stop working on policy. India is not a structured polity like the US or UK, where things happen even when the politician is not there," Ramaswamy said.
Karnataka has, over the years, seen both types of politicians. While former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda prided himself on sleeping only four hours and working non-stop -- although he has been caught napping at public functions -- his successor former chief minister JH Patel, made it clear that after 6 pm, every day, his hours were his own. The current CM, Siddaramaiah, is a mix of the two and tries to keep his Sunday afternoons free, meeting only personal visitors.

CAG trashes SEZ Policy for making a fast buckCAG trashes SEZ Policy for diverting land to realty projects
Mail Today Bureau     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 29, 2014  | 10:51 IST
Comptroller and Auditor General of India Shashi Kant Sharma
The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) has trashed the Special Economic Zones (SEZs) Policy as it has ended up diverting huge tracts of land acquired for setting up manufacturing facilities and generating jobs to real estate projects for making a fast buck.
"We noted a trend wherein developers approached the government for allotment/purchase of vast areas of land in the name of SEZ. However, only a fraction of the land so acquired was notified for SEZ and later denotification was also resorted to within a few years to benefit from price appreciation," a CAG report tabled in Parliament on Friday stated. Land appeared to be the most crucial and attractive component of the scheme, it added.
The audit report found that the figures for employment creation, exports and economic activity being projected by the commerce ministry to push the policy were not properly verified and have turned out to be highly exaggerated. In terms of area of land, out of 39,245.56 hectares notified in the six states (Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra and West Bengal), 5,402.22 hectares (14 per cent) was denotified and diverted for commercial purposes in several cases, it said.
Many tracts of land acquired are not serving the objectives of the SEZ Act, the report said.
In Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and West Bengal, 11 developers had raised Rs 6,309.53 crore of loan through mortgaging SEZ lands. Out of which, three developers had utilised the loan amount (Rs 2,211.48 crore) i.e 35 per cent, for the purpose other than the development of SEZ as there was no economic activity in the SEZs concerned.
Exports shortfall
SEZs had availed tax concessions to the tune of Rs 83,104.76 crore between 2006-07 and 2012-13. "Our review of the tax assessments indicated several instances of extending ineligible exemptions to the tune of Rs 1,150.06 crore and systemic weaknesses in direct and indirect tax administration to the tune of Rs 27,130.98 crore," the report added.
Generation of employment opportunities, encouraging investment and increasing India's share in global exports are the three important objectives of the SEZ Act, 2005.
Performance of sampled SEZs (152) in the country indicated "non performance" in employment ranging from 65.95 per cent to 96.58 per cent in investment ranging from 23.98 per cent to 74.92 per cent and in the case of exports ranging from 46.16 per cent to 93.81 per cent.
Another significant trend in the SEZ growth has been the preponderance of IT/ITES industry, which accounted for 56.64 per cent of SEZs, while only 9.6 per cent were catering for the multi-product manufacturing sector.

Easier gold import norms to boost market confidence: WGCWorld Gold Council says removal of 80:20 gold import norm to boost jewellers' confidence
IANS     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 29, 2014  | 15:00 IST

World Gold Council India MD Somasundaram PR welcomed the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) decision to remove the 80:20 scheme on gold imports, saying the move will definitely boost confidence in general and in the jewellery industry, in particular.
"It has been decided by the government of India to withdraw the 20:80 scheme and restrictions placed on import of gold. Accordingly, all instructions issued about the scheme from time to time starting with A.P. (DIR Series) Circular No.25 dated August 14, 2013 stand withdrawn with immediate effect," the central bank had said in a notification on Friday.
Under the scheme, 20 per cent of the imported gold had to be exported before getting a new lot. The scheme was put in place in August 2013 to curb gold imports, which was considered a major cause for the widening current account deficit (CAD) of the country.
"The removal of the 80:20 scheme is a welcome development and one that reflects previous statements from the RBI and the government that gold curbs are meant to be short term. The timing of this development though surprising, will definitely boost confidence in general, and in the jewellery industry, in particular," he said.
WGC said it will maintain its expectations for demand in 2014 to be within a range of 850-950 tonnes, slightly lower than last year.
"Sharp import hikes in recent months were not triggered by changes in demand estimates but more likely to be as a result of an expectation of additional curbs. The official supply situation must now ease to benefit genuine exporters and manufacturers of gold jewellery," Somasundaram said.
"Discussions on gold in India must move beyond curbs and focus on how this industry can fulfill its vision to make a major contribution to the country's prosperity in the next five years. India should support this vision by creating a favourable eco system that deals with gold as a fungible asset category, reflecting its cultural and economic significance. It is imperative that we find ways of mobilising and monetising the household savings imbedded in gold stocks through the formal financial sector for the benefit of the economy as a whole. It's time to re-engage all stakeholders to develop a coherent long term policy on gold that is aligned to the nation's growth objectives," he added.

Ferguson shooting: Officer Wilson who killed black teen resigns from forceBy: Reuters | Ferguson |
Posted: November 30, 2014 9:32 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 9:48 am
The white police officer who fatally shot an unarmed black teenager in St. Louis suburb has resigned, his lawyer said on Saturday, as activists set out on a 120-mile march to protest the killing and a grand jury’s decision not to indict him.
The resignation of Darren Wilson from the Ferguson, Missouri, police force comes nearly four months after he killed 18-year-old Michael Brown and days after the announcement that he would not face criminal charges.
The incident, which has led to months of sometimes violent protests in Ferguson, has reignited a debate over race relations and the use of police force in the United States.
A demonstrator sits in front of a street fire during a demonstration following the grand jury decision in the Ferguson, Missouri shooting of Michael Brown, in Oakland, California November 25, 2014. The grand jury decided on Monday not to indict a white police officer over the fatal August shooting of an unarmed black teenager. (Source: Reuters)
Neil Bruntrager, an attorney for Wilson, confirmed that the officer had submitted his resignation, a move that was long anticipated, no matter the outcome of the grand jury’s deliberations. The news was earlier reported by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and the Associated Press.
“In terms of his safety, it is probably the best thing for him,” said Cynthia Burnes, 26, a nurse’s assistant from St. Louis who was among a dozen people gathered in front of the Ferguson police headquarters on Saturday evening. “He is black-listed from this moment on.”
In a letter published by the Post-Dispatch, Wilson said he had been told that “my continued employment may put the residents and police officers of the City of Ferguson at risk, which is a circumstance that I cannot allow.”

Sensational slide: Petrol price cut by 91 paise/litre  diesel by 84 paiseTata Steel close to reopening its top iron ore mine
Petrol price was today cut by 91 paise a litre, the seventh reduction since August, and diesel by 84 paise per litre, the third straight cut, as international oil rates continued to slump.
Petrol and diesel price reduction will be effective midnight tonight, Indian Oil Corp, the nation’s largest fuel retailer, announced here.
In Delhi, petrol price will cost Rs 63.33 a litre as compared to Rs 64.24 per litre previously while in Mumbai the reduction will be 96 paise to Rs 70.95 per litre.
Diesel will cost Rs 52.51 a litre in Delhi from tomorrow as against Rs 53.35 currently while in Mumbai the price will be cut by 93 paise to Rs 60.11 per litre.
Rates differ from state to state due to differential local sales tax or VAT rates.
The prices of petrol and diesel were last revised downwards on November 1 by Rs 2.41 a litre and Rs 2.25 per litre respectively (including state levies at Delhi) on the back of declining international oil prices.
“Since the last price changes, the international prices of both petrol and diesel have continued to be on a downtrend. The Rupee-USD exchange rate has however appreciated since the last price change. The combined impact of both these factors warrant a decrease in retail selling prices of both petrol and diesel,” IOC said in the statement.
This is the seventh consecutive reduction in petrol prices since August and third in diesel in rates since October.
Prior to today’s reduction, petrol price has been cumulatively cut by Rs 9.36 per litre since August.
Diesel price was cut for the first time in more than five years on October 19 by Rs 3.37 a litre when the government decided to deregulate the fuel. This was followed by another reduction on November 1.
“The movement of prices in international oil market and INR-USD exchange rate shall continue to be closely monitored and developing trends of the market will be reflected in future price changes,” the statement said.
Rates would have been cut by Rs 1.50 on November 16 but the government took away the gains by way of an excise duty increase.
Excise duty on normal or unbranded petrol was hiked from Rs 1.20 per litre to Rs 2.70 per litre and unbranded diesel from Rs 1.46 a litre to Rs 2.96.
The same on branded petrol was raised from Rs 2.35 a litre to Rs 3.85 and on branded diesel from Rs 3.75 to Rs 5.25 per litre.
While the fall in global rates and the resultant cuts in retail prices have led to loss of revenue to the exchequer, particularly of state governments, there wasn’t any loss to the central government on account of reduction in petrol and diesel prices as excise duty on the two fuel is fixed and not ad valorem. The increase in excise duty would give the government of Rs 13,000 crore additional revenue annually.
State-owned fuel retailers Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp (HPCL) follow the fortnightly review practice and change rates on 1st and 16th of every month.
Oil firms revise rates of petrol, which was deregulated in June 2010, and diesel on 1st and 16th of every month based on average international oil price and rupee-US dollar exchange rate.

Driven by reforms momentum and decline in inflation, India is expected to see a growth rate of 5.6 percent in 2014-15 even as the GDP expansion slowed in the second quarter, says a Citigroup report.
According to the global financial services major, the reform momentum post the assembly polls, improving liquidity conditions paint a bullish picture of the Indian economy. 
For the second quarter of this fiscal year, GDP growth slowed to 5.3 percent, from 5.7 percent in the previous April-June quarter.
The growth figure for the first half of this fiscal year stands at 5.5 percent significantly higher than 4.9 percent in the same period last year.
"The reform momentum post the assembly polls, improving liquidity conditions and project clearances prompt us to retain our full-year growth estimate of 5.6 percent in the current financial year as against 4.7 percent last year," the report said.
The decline in GDP growth rate in the second quarter was mainly on account of subdued performance of agriculture and manufacturing sectors.

JSW Steel Plans Rs 2,000 Crore Iron Ore Pipeline

Motherson Sumi's German Acquisition to Be EPS Accretive
Kolkata: JSW Steel is working towards a de-risking strategy for iron ore that will fuel its ambition to turn its Bellary plant into world's largest single-site steel plant by 2022.
"We are setting up 500km slurry pipeline to import iron-ore into the Vijayanagar plant in Bellary from a port near Goa. My vision is to turn Vijayanagar from 10 million tonne to 20 million tonne, world's largest single site steel plant by 2022," JSW Steel chairman and managing director Sajjan Jindal said on Sunday.
He was speaking on the sidelines of inauguration Ispat Pragati Bhawan, the new office of Insdag.
He said Karnataka can offer maximum iron-ore of 15 million tonne, while to take the steel production to 20 million tonne, JSW would require 35 million tonne of iron-ore.
Mr Jindal said laying the 500 km pipeline from Jaigarh near Goa to the Bellary district would cost about Rs 2000 crore and it will come up over the next two years.
The project will pump imported iron-ore from overseas sources and will have an annual freight cost saving of Rs 2000 crore and that will help neutralise the cost disadvantage of imported iron-ore, the company said.
JSW on Sunday said only 50 per cent of its iron-ore requirement is fed by domestic sources, most of which is from Karnataka.

IPL spot-fixing: My fate was sealed in five minutes  claims Sreesanthprint
The Justice Mudgal panel's final report on the IPL spot-fixing scandal has named top BCCI officials.
The Supreme Court has also made scathing observations days after the BCCI gave a clean chit to its sidelined president, N Srinivasan, and IPL COO, Sundar Raman. The BCCI's two-man panel had not found anything against Srinivasan's son-in-law and CSK official, Gurunath Meiyappan.
But the BCCI banned three Rajasthan Royals players for spot-fixing on the basis of a police chargesheet that is yet to stand scrutiny in court. The main figure in this saga, S Sreesanth, banned for life, feels cheated.
Charged by the police for bowling no balls in exchange for money in an IPL match last year, the former India pacer says in an interview to HT that he is suffering because he doesn't have a 'godfather' and that the BCCI took just five minutes to decide his fate.
Excerpts:
Do you think BCCI has done injustice to you?
It's more than injustice, but I don't want to talk about this because my case is sub judice. I don't want to make more enemies. But one thing is clear, I've not been pronounced guilty by the court. I am not bothered about others getting a clean chit. I think of myself and my cricket. There is no proof against me, but if there is, it should become clear (in the court).
Were you not given a chance to present your case properly while deposing before BCCI's Anti-Corruption officials?
They hardly even heard me and decided my fate in five minutes. I was told BCCI was looking into the matter and that I would be informed about the outcome of the inquiry. I had hardly come down and got into my car when I started getting calls from you (media) guys that I have been banned for life. I was shocked. More than anything else, I am not in a position to go back to these people. I don't have a godfather. Whatever I have earned in life is by grace of god. I have not done anything against the game. Whatever I was accused of is based on circumstantial evidence. There is nothing direct against me, nothing has been proved so far.
The Supreme Court suggests there should be overall change in BCCI. If this happens, do you see any hope?
Of course. I am not worrying about playing for India. I just want to be allowed to play for Kerala, or first class or county cricket. I love to play cricket in an honest way. Sooner or later everything will come out. I am praying for this. I just want my cricket back. I am 31-32 now. I just got four or five years of cricket left in me.
How tough were the last two years?
I have gone through something that even my enemy should not. Everything happening with me was insulting, but the biggest humiliation was taking away my cricket. My Kochi ground is just 500 metres from my home but I can't even enter it. This is everyday humiliation.
Are you following the Supreme Court hearing?
Yes. I believe something great will come out. As far as my case is concerned, one thing is clear... I am not even an accused in court, I am just a co-accused. There is nothing against me in the supplementary charge-sheet. My lawyers will argue on January 13. I have a feeling I will come clean.
So, nothing good has happened to you in life since the ban?
It's not like that. I am going to be a father soon.

Asian Markets Mixed, Oil Prices Sink Further
Agence France Presse | Updated On: December 01, 2014 08:59 (IST)
Oil Slumps Near $59 for First Time Since 2009 on Oversupply
Hong Kong: Asian markets were mixed Monday after China released data pointing to further weakness in the country's manufacturing sector, while Tokyo hit a seven-year high as the yen slipped against the dollar.
Energy firms took a hit for a second successive session while airlines climbed after OPEC's decision to maintain oil output levels despite a supply glut and plunging prices.
Tokyo rallied 0.98 per cent to its highest level since July 2007 thanks to fresh yen weakness, while Shanghai added 0.60 per cent on hopes for more economy-boosting measures from China's leaders.
However, Hong Kong sank 1.29 per cent, Sydney slipped 0.78 per cent and Seoul was 0.86 per cent lower.
China's official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) of manufacturing eased to 50.3 last month, lower than the 50.8 seen in October and the weakest since March. A figure above 50 signals expansion in the sector, while anything below indicates contraction.
The figure is the latest pointing to a slowdown in the world's number two economy and follows a surprise move by the central People's Bank of China on November 21 to cut interest rates.
Adding to worries about the economy, the independent China Index Academy said Sunday that house prices in the country's 100 major cities fell on a monthly basis for the seventh straight month in November.
Energy firms in the region fell again as oil prices sank to multi-year lows in reaction to Thursday's announcement by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries that it would not cut production of the black gold.
Energy firms down, airlines up
The cartel refused to listen to calls for a reduction, despite prices having tumbled more than 30 per cent since June on the back of an oversupply caused by weak demand and a surge in output from the United States.
US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for January delivery plunged $1.55 in early Asian trading to $64.60, its lowest intraday level since July 2009.
Brent crude for January sank $1.84 to $68.31, lows not seen since February 2010.
Among the biggest losers were Sydney-listed Santos, which fell almost seven per cent, while BHP Billiton lost 3.4 per cent and Woodside shed 4.9 per cent. In Hong Kong PetroChina was 2.2 per cent lower and CNOOC fell 3.3 per cent.
"Negative actions in the oil market are continuing today. Investors see crude as remaining vulnerable after last week's OPEC announcement," Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, told AFP.
"We have not yet seen any piece of news or development that could trigger a bottoming out phase in oil prices," he added.
However, airlines -- whose biggest cost is fuel -- climbed again. In Tokyo Japan Airlines added 5.9 per cent and rival ANA gained 4.3 per cent, while in Hong Kong Cathay Pacific rose 4.3 per cent and Korean Airlines in Seoul was up 6.1 per cent.
On foreign exchange markets the dollar rose to 118.92 yen, up from 118.65 yen in New York Friday.
The euro also climbed to 147.93 yen from 147.64 yen, while it also bought $1.2437 against $1.2443.
Wall Street ended mixed in truncated trade Friday after the Thanksgiving holiday.
The Dow edged marginally higher to a new record and the Nasdaq added 0.09 percent but the S&P 500 slid 0.25 per cent.
Gold was at $1,151.60 an ounce, compared with $1,182.86 late Friday.

Oil Slumps Near $59 for First Time Since 2009 on Oversupply
The Nifty jumped over 35 points to hit a record high of 8,623 on Monday as oil prices tumbled to a five-year low. Oil-users were among the top gainers today.
Jet Airways surged over 9 per cent, while Asian Paints traded 5 per cent higher. Apollo Tyres rose nearly 3 per cent and state-run oil marketing company Hindustan Petroleum Corp jumped over 2 per cent. The fall in crude oil will boost operating margins for users and increase discretionary spends in the economy, analysts say.
"We believe there is still room for the downstream crude players or those that use crude as a raw material to move north, be it paints, tyres, OMCs or lubricant companies," said Jyotheesh Kumar, executive vice-president of HDFC Securities.
Markets also got a boost after the government scrapped a rule mandating traders to export 20 per cent of all gold imported into the country.
Friday's move to ease gold imports sent jewellery stocks sharply higher today. Titan, India's biggest gold company surged over 6.5 per cent, while Rajesh Exports traded with over 6 per cent gains in morning trade.
Banking shares also traded higher ahead of crucial Reserve Bank policy announcement tomorrow. Traders have pinned their hopes on a rate cut, but most economists say the central bank will hold rates. Private lenders such as Axis Bank were among the top Nifty gainers today.
India has been the best-performing emerging market this year on the back of record buying by foreign investors. On Friday, FIIs bought shares worth Rs 936 crore. They have invested over $40 billion in debt and equities this calendar year.
Despite many positives, markets seemed to be under pressure because of the weakness in the rupee, which hit a nine-month low today. Concerns that a rate cut many not happen tomorrow also checked bullish sentiments, traders say. Only 4 out of 45 economists polled by Reuters expect a rate reduction.
Capital goods and metal shares saw selling pressure. Jindal Steel and Power was the top Nifty loser, down 2.5 per cent, followed by NMDC and Sesa Sterlite.
State-run BHEL traded 2 per cent lower, while L&T was down 1 per cent. Cairn India fell 1.5 per cent as falling crude oil prices are likely to weigh on its refining margins

Lots of tablet choices? Here're some buying tips for you

New York: People tend to hold onto tablets longer than smartphones, so take time to weigh your options. A major consideration is what phone you or your gift recipient already has.
Although it's possible for Android owners to have Apple's iPads, for instance, there are advantages to sticking within the same system. You often can buy apps just once and share them across both devices, and you don't need to learn two different systems.
Here are some buying tips organised by system. Prices listed are for base models. You can typically spend more for additional storage or LTE cellular connectivity.
The advantage of sticking with an Android tablet for Android phone owners is having a unified library of apps.
#android #apple #ios #windows
Apple's iOS
The iPad remains top of the line among tablets. The selection of apps designed specifically for it is unmatched. Those who already have iPhones will appreciate the ability to start email and other tasks on one device and finish on the other. You can even make phone calls from iPads, if you have an iPhone on the same WiFi network.
The downside is the $499 price tag for the latest full-size model, the iPad Air 2. Many Android tablets are cheaper. You do get a light and skinny device for the price, with a camera that matches the iPhone's 8 megapixels (though the iPad still lacks a flash). The new Air also has a fingerprint sensor to bypass security passcodes and to authorize online purchases using Apple Pay. It won't work with in-store payments, though.
If you are on a budget or want a smaller device, consider last year's iPad Mini 2 for $299. This year's Mini doesn't have many improvements over last year's model, except for the fingerprint and Apple Pay capabilities. The convenience might not be worth spending more for the $399 iPad Mini 3.
You might consider putting the savings toward a mid-tier or higher-end model. With both the Air 2 and the Mini 3, you can upgrade to 64 gigabytes of storage from 16 GB for just $100 more. Or get 128 GB for $200 more than the base model.
Google's Android
Android phones and tablets don't let you switch back and forth as easily as Apple devices do. The advantage of sticking with an Android tablet for Android phone owners is having a unified library of apps.
Samsung's Galaxy Tab S is the best of the Android tablets I've tried. The display uses a technology called AMOLED to produce colours that pop out as you view video or browse the Web. But the Tab S also comes with a high price tag - $500 for the full-size model and $400 for the smaller one.
Samsung does offer an even-pricier Pro series, with screens of up to 12.2 inches diagonally, but that's really aimed at professionals. Full-size models tend to be nine or 10 inches, while mini models are seven or eight inches. At the small and cheap end, Samsung offers the 7-inch Galaxy Tab 4 for about $180. Book lovers can choose a Nook edition, made in partnership with Barnes & Noble.
Google's $399 Nexus 9 has the advantage of running an Android version that's closest to Google's vision. Samsung and other manufacturers typically add their own twists, which can confuse consumers. The Nexus does have a wireless chip for in-store mobile payments using Google Wallet, if you feel like waving it around in the checkout line.
I'm including Amazon's Fire HDX tablets under Android, even though the system's been modified so much that there's little resemblance. App selection isn't as good as what you get on purer Android devices. But Amazon is able to add such features as one-button access to live video help. It is great for first-time tablet owners and comes at a nice price - the full-size model for $379 and the smaller one for $179.
Microsoft's Windows
Until Windows 10 comes out next year, there's a huge divide between Windows phones and Windows tablets. Apps aren't compatible, and Windows tablets have more in common with Windows desktops and laptops. A Windows tablet is best suited for someone looking to replace a PC. In fact, many Windows tablets are just laptops with detachable keyboards.
There are too many models to list, so I'll use Microsoft's own Surface Pro 3 as an example. You type on a touch screen or attach a $130 keyboard cover. The Surface itself starts at $799, though configurations go as high as $1,949 for those serious about ditching the PC. The Surface's built-in kickstand can be adjusted to a range of positions, some better for desks and others for the lap. The best thing about Windows tablets is their ability to run regular Windows software, such as Office and Photoshop. Other tablets have, at best, a light version.

Some of its biggest stars may be down with injuries but Chennaiyin FC has found its saviour in Bruno Pelissari. The Brazilian youngster, coming in as a 72nd minute substitute, scored the match-winner 15 minutes later as the visitor defeated Kerala Blasters FC by a lone goal in the Indian Super League at the Nehru Stadium here on Sunday night.
The victory, Chennaiyin’s sixth and which carried it to 22 points, has assured the table topper a semifinal berth after the 12th round while the Blasters stay on 15 points after tasting their first defeat at home in five games.
Pelissari’s goal, his third in the ISL, came shortly after a Blasters corner. He ran down nicely through the centre from his own half and sent in a beautiful one to the top left corner of the net foxing goalkeeper Sandip Nandy completely.
With the match attracting 61,323 spectators – a record for the ISL in Kochi and one of the biggest in the whole league – the home side was expected to apply pressure on the Chennai side.
However, the home side suffered a big setback early on when goalkeeper and marquee player David James, who had suffered a groin injury in the last game, aggravated the problem in the 18th minute. He was replaced with Nandy.
But Chennaiyin, which made two changes to Kerala’s six from its last game, was unable to take advantage of it. Jeje Lalpekhlua and Bernard Mendy threatened but shot over.
The Blasters’ best chance came soon after the break.
The home side’s tall central midfielder Stephen Pearson sent a ball to C.S. Sabeeth who relayed it to Hume. But the Canadian hit it wide much to the dismay of head coach James who was walking up and down restlessly.
Hume also had an early chance to put the host ahead. Right back Sandesh Jhingan, who moved up frequently, sent a nice cross to Hume inside the box but he was slow to react and Chennaiyin FC goalkeeper Gennaro rushed out to ward off the danger.
The Blasters pulled out Avinabo Bag and brought in Pedro Gusmao shortly after the hour-mark and ten minutes later, with no goals coming, Chennaiyin FC pulled out Cristian Hiidalgo and brought in Pelissari. That move did the trick.
The result:

See 30-40% lower interest cost; H2FY15 better than H1: IOCOverall, we should have a total under recovery for the year of the order of about the Rs 43,000 to 44,000 crore.
B Ashok
Chairman
IOC
In an interview to CNBC-TV18, B Ashok, chairman,  IOC spoke about the positive impact of fall in crude prices for the company.
He feels with the oil prices falling internationally, times are good for the country and the company.
For the company per se, he expects the interest costs to be lower by 30-40% in FY15 compared to the last fiscal. Overall too, he expects H2FY15 to be substantially better than H1. In the first half the interest costs for the company fell by Rs 900 crore.
Currently, there are under recoveries only on PDS Kerosene and domestic LPG and no under recoveries on petrol and diesel, says Ashok. Under-recoveries for FY15 are seen at Rs 43,000-44,000 Cr
Although the margin picture for FY15 looks upbeat, the company would have to closely monitor crude oil prices and forex fluctuations for the balance of FY15.
The company is making reasonable profits on petrol and diesel, he adds.
IOC has cut its petrol prices by 91 paise per litre while diesel prices by 84 paise.
Below is the transcript of B Ashok's interview with Latha Venkatesh & Sonia Shenoy on CNBC-TV18.
Latha: What is the under recovery bill likely to be? How much of a cut will you see in your own subsidy you think?
A: Signs are good certainly for the country and prices have been quite stable in the lower levels. Certainly, there are no under recoveries any more on petrol and diesel that we can talk of.
Currently the under recoveries are only limited to two products which is Public Distribution System (PDS) Kerosene and domestic LPG. Overall we think that for Indian Oil we should have a total under recovery for the year of the order of about the Rs 43,000 to 44,000 crore.
Sonia: As you’re under recoveries will fall so much how much will your interest cost go down by the end of FY15? You paid about Rs 5,900 crore of interest in FY14, what could it fall too?
A: If you look at the first half of the year itself actually this is based on the results that we have already announced.
Our interest cost had come down from something of the order of Rs 2,900 crore, it is fallen by about Rs 900 crore during the first half. The second half is only going to be a little better than that because the prices have gone down substantially after that. So, our interest cost should be probably less by at least about 30-40 percent compared to the last year easily.
Sonia: You had reported a gross refining margin (GRM) which was negative USD 2 per barrel in the quarter gone by because of high inventory losses. For the second half of the year what is your projection as far as gross refining margins are concerned?
A: When you talk of the GRMs you have to look at it in two parts. One is that basically whether on the operational parameters we are improving or not. I am very happy to say that as far as Indian Oil refineries are concerned all are operational parameters have improved substantially. Also when we talk of operational parameters it is in terms of the yield from the refinery that is the middle distillates and above, which have gone up substantially.  
The fuel and losses which are major component of the refineries operational expenditure they have come down to below 9 percent form above 9 percent and the third thing is the over all energy intensity index of the refinery which has also shown substantial improvement.
So, if you look at an operational performance Indian Oil refineries are doing very well and so from that perspective the margins are looking brighter.
They have been losses in the inventory and during the first half of the year we have declared an inventory loss of over Rs 4,000 crore as compared to corresponding gain during the same period last year. Going forward we need to really see how does the crude oil price behave and we will have to take a call at that point of time. However, the operational parameters are doing well so we are quite hopeful that things should pan out well for rest of the year.
Inventory loss for the first half of the current year was of the order of around Rs 4,000 crore when you take into account both crude as well as product inventories. But during the corresponding half of last year we had a gain of an equivalent amount. So, that is what has made a difference to our results.
Latha: How should we see it for the current quarter and will you have inventory losses for Q4 as well or would you be very light on inventories?
A: It is little difficult to guess on that point. You have seen the volatility of the prices.
Latha: You would know current quarter?
A: As I said in the beginning the current quarter as far as over all crude prices are concerned have been good and good for the country. So inventory losses have been there but we do believe that we need to take the call at the end of the quarter. We can not take it on the basis of today. So, looking at the fluctuation in terms of crude oil prices we will have to see how it behaves.
At the same time let me also say that the product prices are another parameter which we need to monitor as well as the exchange rate fluctuations and so on. So, it is not a direct simple calculation of how much the crude oil prices have fallen.
Sonia: Can you tell us exactly how much the GRMs could improve too?
A: That is also a difficult guess but I can only probably give you some indication. If you had looked at our figures of the first half of last year vis-à-vis the figures of the first half of the current year our operational GRMs had improved by at least more than USD 1.5 a barrel.
Latha: What is the current profit you are making on diesel and petrol?
A: We are making reasonable profits but more than anything else we operate on thin margins; 45 percent of our product sales are on diesel whereas when you consider our turnover of almost Rs 4.75 lakh crore, the profit margins are not very big.
However, two components will help us which is because the under recoveries are going down we don’t think that the unmet under recoveries if at all there is a component like that would be there.
The second thing is in terms of the interest loss so if both these factors are playing out favorably for us, we should be able to make a reasonable margin on diesel as well as petrol.
Latha: How much is the over recovery in diesel and petrol?
A: There is no over recovery or under recovery at this point of time because both these products have been decontrolled. We can not take product prices on a daily basis and say that today the crude prices are so much or product prices are so much and so this is what we make. These are all not based on immediate term you will have to look at it over a period of time. The crude that we are processing that we have been procured over period of time so on and the product prices have also are playing a role in terms of fixation of prices. Over and above that there is a factor of this exchange.
Q: But exchange has been stable, so you have a cushion?
A: You cannot look at it as a cushion. As of first forth night of November actually we did not have any thing extra with us in both motor spirit (MS) as well as diesel. So, we take a call on a basis of a reasonable period of time so you don’t look at prices for the day.

Shares in jewellery firms rose sharply in early trade after the Reserve Bank of India announced Friday the government had scrapped the 80:20 scheme, which mandated that 20 percent of raw gold imported into the country had to be exported as finished product.
The scheme was introduced as one of moves forming the currency defence of last year when the rupee had depreciated to 68 to the US dollar.
In early Mumbai trading, Shree Ganesh Jewellery  and Gitanjali Gems  were up 20 percent, locked in upper circuit filter, while Tribhovandas Bhimji Zaveri , Tara Jewels  and PC Jeweller  surged 7.9 percent to 13.9 percent.
The introduction of the scheme, along with the move to hike import duty from 2 percent to 10 percent, had resulted in gold imports falling by 25 percent in FY14, compared to the year earlier.
The scrapping of the scheme is expected to cut premiums of gold, lead to lower prices and boost demand for the yellow metal and will be a positive for the jewellery makers.

Haryana sisters beat up molesters in bus  passengers merely look onHaryana sisters who beat up molesters to be felicitated by CM
PTI  Rohtak, Haryana, November 30, 2014
First Published: 18:41 IST(30/11/2014) | Last Updated: 13:58 IST(1/12/2014)
Comments
The brave college-going sisters, who fought back eve-teasers in a Haryana Roadways bus, will be honoured by Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Republic day.
In a rare show of courage, the two sisters thrashed three molestors inside a bus in Haryana's Rohtak town, even as passengers chose to look the other way.
Both sisters confronted the accused and mustered enough courage to thrash them, with one of the girls even hitting the youths with her belt, for allegedly outraging their modesty.
The entire incident, recorded by a passenger on mobile phone, went viral both on television and social media. It showed the two girls using their hands and a belt to thrash the molestors, who appeared to be taken by surprise.
A case has been registered against three youths in this connection, police said on Sunday. No arrest has, however, been made so far.
The accused have been identified as Kuldeep, Mohit and Deepak, police said, adding that a case under section 354 (assault or criminal force with intent to outrage woman's modesty) and section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of IPC have been registered against them.
The victims in their complaint alleged that they were harassed by some youths in a Haryana Roadways bus when they were going to their college on Friday.
When the victims objected, one of the accused started beating them up.
Not to give up easily, the girls fought with the accused as fellow passengers remained mute spectators. One of the victims even hit the accused with a belt, police said.
One of the girls said, "They threatened us and abused us. One of them touched my sister inappropriately. They started making obscene gestures... After heated exchanges, one of the boys called his friends asking him to beat us up. One of them beat my sister while two others caught hold of me.
"Then, I whipped out my belt and thrashed them. They pushed us out of the bus when it slowed down," she narrated.
Meanwhile, the father of the two sisters alleged that there was pressure from the panchayat that the girls should withdraw the complaint.
SP Rohtak Shanshank Anand told PTI over phone, "We have identified the accused and soon they will be arrested. These are brave girls and we fully support them."

Actor and model Gauahar Khan was allegedly slapped by a 24-year-old youth who was in the audience of a singing show hosted by her at Film City, Goregaon (East), on Sunday. The Aarey Sub police have detained the suspect, Akil Malik. Police sources said the accused told them he disapproved of the actor wearing a short skirt.

According to the police, the incident took place during the final episode of India's Raw Star at studio number 9. “A preliminary probe has revealed that someone from the audience started teasing Khan to which she protested. An argument ensued between Gauahar and the man who was teasing her. Things turned ugly when the man suddenly slapped the actor,” an Aarey police officer said requesting anonymity.
India's Raw Star is an Indian singing competition series hosted by Khan and mentored by singer-rapper Yo Yo Honey Singh.
The brawl did not end there with one of the show’s finalists and one of the production men beating up the accused. Guards deployed at the venue intervened and caught the accused and handed him over to the police who later sent him for a medical examination.
A source from the show reveals, “There were over 2,500 people present at the venue with 250 bouncers. Yet a 24-year-old guy in the crowd teased Khan and got into an argument with her. While he was being escorted out of the place, he managed to go up on stage and slapped her.”
The source adds, “It was chaos after the security pulled the man away. Gauahar was shocked and was crying a lot. A stunned Gauahar didn’t understand what happened. Though the shooting was stopped, Gauahar took a break of an hour to gather her bearings and then reported back on stage to finish the leftover one hour shoot.”
“We will record Khan’s statement in detail and will register a case under section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 354 (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) of Indian Penal Code and will arrest the accused youth,” said Vilas Chavan, senior inspector of the Aarey Sub police station.

State-run IOC in expansion mode  bets big on petrochemicalsState-run IOC in expansion mode, bets big on petrochemicals
Kalpana Pathak | Mumbai Dec 01, 2014 11:21 AM IST
India’s second largest petrochemical firm Indian Oil Corp (IOCL) is planning to add capacity across some of its refineries, besides expanding beyond its core business of pipeline, transportation and marketing, to gas, petrochemical and upstream. 
 
“Our expansion bodes well for our future and will improve our bottomlines. It will also give us some amount of cushion in terms of volatility in one segment of the business," said Ashok Balasubramanian, chairman and managing director, IOCL.
 
IOCL currently operates 10 refineries with a capacity of 65.7 million metric tonnes (MMT) per annum and accounts for 31% of the national refining capacity and has a 19% share in the petrochemical segment. It already has petrochemical units alongside its Koyali refinery in Gujarat and Panipat refinery in Haryana.
 
“We think there is a lot of potential for polymer usage in India and as the petrochemical space expands, we are becoming more and more active,” said Balasubramanian. “We are considering petrochemical opportunities at various refineries of ours and thinking how we can extract value from our existing refineries. Though cyclic, petrochemical is a good business to be in." 
 
IOCL is building a polypropylene plant in Paradip, Odisha, that is expected to be ready by mid-2017. It is also building a Rs 35,000 crore refinery there with a complexity index of 12.5 that is close to commissioning. 
 
“The refinery is 97.3 per cent complete and we will start phased commissioning of the refinery in February or March 2015,” Balasubramanian said. 
 
The company is still scouting for a location on the west coast to set up a greenfield refinery.
 

Assam groups angry over PM Narendra Modi stand on Bangla landswapWritten by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati |
Posted: December 1, 2014 12:18 pm | Updated: December 1, 2014 12:24 pm
Narendra Modi may have left a deep impression in the minds of the people of Assam during his two-day maiden visit to the state after taking over as prime minister six months ago. But his stand on the land transfer agreement between India and Bangladesh – in which some portion of Assam land would go to the other country – have left many unhappy.
Particularly sore are the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU), Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), Asom Jatiyabadi Yuva-Chatra Parishad (AJYCP) and Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSSS), all of which have hit out at Modi for allegedly changing the BJP’s stand on the issue. Modi had in a party rally here on Sunday said his government would utilize the Indo-Bangla land swap agreement to curb further infiltration from Bangladesh.
“The people of Assam clearly remember that while Narendra Modi had gone record saying he was opposed to land transfer to Bangladesh, the BJP had even called a bandh to protest the then prime minister Manmohan Singh’s pact with Hasina,” said Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) president Atul Bora. “This announcement of Modi has once again vindicated our stand that there is no basic difference between BJP and Congress in relation to their outlook on Assam,” Bora added.
The All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) on the other hand termed Modi’s latest stand on the Indo-Bangla land transfer pact as a betrayal. “The prime minister, whose party had so long opposed ttransfer of Assam’s land to Bangladesh, has openly betrayed the people of Assam. We strongly oppose his stand. Whatver portion of land India is supposed to get back from Bangladesh is also our land, whatever portion the government wants to give away to that country is also ours,” said AASU president Sankar Prasad Roy and general secretary Tapan Kumar ogoi in a statement here last evening.
Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) president Akhil Gogoi and AJYCP president Manoj Barua have also criticized the prime minister for his alleged “changed” stand on the land transfer deal with Bangladesh. “How did the prime minister forget that the BJP leaders had unfurled the national flag on those patches of land on the border which are supposed to transferred to Bangladesh?” asked AJYCP president Manoj Barua.
According to the pact, altogether 665 acres of land was under adverse possession of both countries. Assam will regain 397.5 acres of land while Bangladesh will get 267.5 acres following the land transfer agreement. The agreement is also expected to ensure demarcation and erection of fencing on the unfenced 2.86-km stretch in the Lathitilla-Dumabari sector in Karimganj district in southern Assam along the Indo-Bengal border.

Paul Walker fans pay tribute on his first deathanniversaryBy: Press Trust of India | Los Angeles |
Posted: December 1, 2014 12:14 pm
Fans of tragic actor Paul Walker gathered at the fatal crash site to pay their respects to the ‘Fast & Furious star’, one year after his demise. Walker, 40, lost his life when a Porsche he was a passenger in crashed into a pole in Valencia, California on November 30 last year.
Hundreds of fans ignored heavy rain to gather at the site and leave flowers and photos of their hero, reported TMZ online.
Walker’s ‘Fast & Furious’ co-stars Michelle Rodriguez and Tyrese Gibson and members of his family were among those to offer up tributes through social media and news outlets, including Vin Diesel, who posted a touching photo of his daughter, Hania Riley, sitting on Walker’s lap on the set of one of the hit films.
 
Diesel wrote, “He was a part of so much in my life… long personal talks with my mother or babysitting the Alpha Angel (Diesel’s daughter)… he took a certain pride in being uncle Pablo… after all, we were filming a scene in Ff4 (Fast & Furious) the day she was born, and he being the only one I told, encouraged me to go in and cut the umbilicle cord. “He was an important part of my transition into fatherhood… that healthy family member, with the most positive outlook on life… “A year ago today… a year of mourning… and his absence still leaves me speechless. We miss you Pablo…”

Top 20 stocks that can return 39% | Brent @ $68  but oil index in redBrent
SINGAPORE: Oil fell more than $2 a barrel to a five-year low in Asian trade on Monday, extending a steep sell-off after OPEC decided not to cut production last week, keeping markets well supplied.
Both U.S. crude and Brent have fallen for five straight months, oil's longest losing streak since the 2008 financial crisis.
"Just when the market was thinking that a 4-year low for crude oil was bad enough, we have hit a 5-year low after the OPEC meeting," Phillip Futures analysts said in a note.
U.S. crude tumbled to near $64, dragging Brent down below $70, after Saudi Arabia's oil minister told fellow OPEC members last week that they must combat the U.S. shale oil boom.
"They (OPEC) can get by at $60 a barrel, but that price would knock out a fair whack of the competition - much U.S. shale oil for example - as well as put investment in future capacity growth firmly on the back-burner," ANZ analysts said in a note.
"They're playing the long game, banking that others can't."
Brent hit a low of $67.82 a barrel, the lowest since October 2009, and was down $1.71 at $68.44 a barrel by 0733 GMT. U.S. crude fell $1.49 to $64.66 a barrel, after earlier slipping to an intraday low of $64.10, the lowest since July 2009.
Oil-producing countries from Iraq to Nigeria are revising their 2015 budgets to reflect lower prices.
Iran refrained from protesting against OPEC's decision to retain its production ceiling to maintain group solidarity, even though the move will not benefit all members, Iranian oil minister said in local media reports.
Slower than expected growth in China's manufacturing sector may add further downward pressure on oil. China's official Purchasing Managers' Index ( PMI ) slipped to 50.3 in November, a government study showed on Monday, lower than analysts' forecasts of 50.6.
"It's not too bad a miss, but probably won't help (oil) too much," Ric Spooner, chief analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney said.
"It's best not to try to pick bottoms at this stage."
Spooner said the next support levels for Brent are at $68 and $64 a barrel. If West Texas Intermediate crude futures fall below $63.90 a barrel, the next support level would be at $50, he said.

Former Arunachal CM Jarbom Gamlin passesawayWritten by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati |
Posted: December 1, 2014 12:36 pm | Updated: December 1, 2014 12:41 pm
Former Arunachal Pradesh chief minister Jarbom Gamlin passed away in a private hospital in Gurgaon following a brief illness late last evening, official sources in Itanagar said on Monday. He was 64. Survived by three daughters and a son, Gamlin’s body will be flown to his native Aalo on Tuesday.
Gamlin had taken over as chief minister of Arunachal Pradesh following the death of Dorjee Khandu in a helicopter crash on April 30, 2011, he had to resign following a major political crisis on October 31 the same year.
Born on April 16, 1961 at Aalo in West Siang district he was the second son of Sokjar Gamlin and Gamde Ete Gamlin. An alumnus of Sainik School, Goalpara (Assam) and graduated in History from St Stephen’s College, New Delhi and later took a degree in law from Campus Law Centre, University of Delhi in 1984.

Indias manufacturing sector output at nearly 2-year peak in Nov:HSBCThe manufacturing sector output, improved for the 13th month in a row and reached a 21-month peak in November. Reuters
New Delhi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 12:26 pm
India’s manufacturing sector output accelerated in November at the quickest pace in nearly two years, driven by robust output and new orders, an HSBC survey said today.
The headline HSBC India Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) — a composite gauge designed to give a single-figure snapshot of manufacturing business conditions — stood at 53.3 in November significantly higher from 51.6 in October.
The manufacturing sector output, improved for the 13th month in a row and reached a 21-month peak in November.
A figure above 50 indicates the sector is expanding, while a figure below that level means contraction.
“Manufacturing activity accelerated further in November led by higher output and new orders. Domestic orders saw the biggest increase, even as new export orders continued to be strong,” HSBC Co-Head of Asian Economic Research Frederic Neumann said.
November data indicated stronger-than-expected demand, as new order growth accelerated to the quickest in 21 months. Similarly, foreign orders received by Indian goods producers continued to rise strongly in November.
In spite of accelerated expansions in output and new business, employment in the manufacturing sector remained broadly unchanged in November, the report said.
“The sharp rise in input prices was surprising, but future prints may be lower as falling commodity prices eventually lead to softer intermediate good prices. Meanwhile, the pick-up in output prices could partly be signalling some revival in pricing power among businesses,” Neumann said.
A cautionary note was, however, provided by the HSBC survey regarding input costs and output charges, as inflationary pressures intensified during the month following three consecutive months of easing.
“Higher output and an uptick in final prices should convince the RBI to stay on hold in the upcoming meeting,” Neumann said.
The RBI, which has maintained the interest at elevated level for the past 10 months, is scheduled to announce it policy review tomorrow.
According to official figure, wholesale inflation came down to a five-year low at 1.77 per cent in October while retail inflation hit a record low of 5.52 per cent in the same month.
Meanwhile, the country’s economic growth fell to 5.3 per cent in the second quarter from 5.7 per cent rate in the first three-month period ended June, raising the clamour for rate cut by the RBI tomorrow.

BJP leaders threat to Vaiko on Modi criticism sparkscontroversyWritten by Arun Janardhanan | Chennai |
Posted: December 2, 2014 12:24 am | Updated: December 3, 2014 1:32 pm
BJP national secretary H Raja remark that MDMK leader Vaiko “may not be able to return home safely” if he continued to criticise Prime Minister Narendra Modi has sparked a controversy in Tamil Nadu with various political parties, including NDA partners, Congress and CPM, condemning the statement.
The latest tug of war between the NDA partners, BJP and MDMK, began after Vaiko, in a series of statements, attacked Modi for favouring Mahinda Rajapaksa’s re-election as Sri Lankan President. The PM during the recent SAARC meeting had congratulated Rajapaksa for his poll success.
Slamming the MDMK general secretary for his statements, Raja said his party workers know how to silence Vaiko if he continued his attack on Modi.
Raja now finds himself isolated on the rant against the MDMK leader as even BJP has distanced itself, saying it was his personal opinion.
However, BJP state president Tamilisai Soundararajan appealed to Vaiko and another ally PMK’s S Ramadoss to stop criticising Modi.
Reacting to Raja’s statement, Ramadoss said Modi was not above criticism. Supporting Vaiko, he said, “It cannot be accepted even if it (PM wishing Rajapaksa) was a courtesy statement.”
On Soundararajan’s appeal to stop criticising Modi, Ramadoss said he does not need lessons from anyone on how to be like alliance partners.

The announcement briefly sent the yen to a seven-year low against the dollar and pushed 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) futures down by 10 ticks.
The US rating agency said the outlook was stable.
Tracking the momentum, the 50-share Nifty index which rose to its record high of 8623 earlier in trade came off from its highs, led by losses in Jindal Steel, NMDC, Tata Power , Sesa Sterlite and BHEL.

Trinamool targets Amit Shah in Parliament  to hold counter-rally in Kolkata todayComments
Trinamool Congress on Monday launched an offensive on the Bharatiya Janata Party in Parliament and held a rally in Kolkata to counter the saffron party president Amit Shah's criticism of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Sunday.
Facing heat over the Saradha scam, Trinamool targeted the BJP inside as well as outside Parliament by alleging that a diary of jailed Sahara group chief Subrata Roy contained the name of a senior leader of the saffron party, leading to clashes and a walkout.
Placard-wielding Trinamool MPs held a demonstration outside Parliament demanding a probe into alleged links between Shah and the Sahara money laundering case.
Trinamool sought to corner the ruling party in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha by displaying symbolic red diaries.
The Trinamool members alleged the diary was recovered from Sahara chief Subrata Roy by the Central Bureau of Investigation during searches at Sahara's office and claimed it contained the name of a BJP leader.
Attack in Parliament
In Lok Sabha, Trinamool MPs rushed to the Well shouting slogans, carrying red-coloured diaries which had "Sahara" written on it. They demanded that PM Modi should explain what action the CBI has taken after the name allegedly figured in the diary. They later staged a walkout.
Bandyopadhyay had given a notice for suspension of Question Hour to discuss the issue which was rejected by Speaker Sumitra Mahajan.
"They (Trinamool MPs) have decided not to follow the rules," she said.
Parliamentary affairs minister M Venkaiah Naidu said according to rules no member can name anyone who is not a member of the House. They also cannot display placards, he said.
To this, the Speaker said the name of the BJP leader would not go on record.
After protesting for a few minutes, the Trinamool MPs staged a walkout.
Minister of state for home affairs Kiren Rijiju, however, denied the presence of the "red diary".
"These are political allegations. There is no truth in it. No such diary was recovered," Rijiju told reporters in Delhi.
Later, BJP member Kirit Somaiya hit back, alleging that the Trinamool government in West Bengal was creating "hurdles" in the CBI investigation into the Saradha chit fund scam, in which names of "one dozen" Trinamool leaders have cropped up.
This led to protests by Trinamool members but Somaiya went on saying that 3.5 lakh small investors had been cheated in the chit fund scheme.
"The state government is not cooperating with the CBI probe," he alleged.
Amid noisy scenes, the Speaker adjourned the House for lunch, ahead of schedule.
In Rajya Sabha, Trinamool's Derek O'Brien sought to raise the issue during Zero Hour and Question Hour but was disallowed.
He had earlier given a notice for suspension of Question Hour but was not allowed.
As O'Brien rose to raise the issue during Question Hour, BJP members shouted him down by raising the issue of Saradha chit fund scam.
The members flashed symbolic red diaries with Sahara written on them, and tried to storm the well of the upper house as well to press their demand.
Trinamool members later staged a walkout as they were disallowed from raising the issue.
Counter-rally in Kolkata
Mamata Banerjee's nephew and Diamond Harbour Lok Sabha MP, Abhisekh Banerjee, said the West Bengal chief minister does not want to respond to Shah as she believes "he is not of her stature".
Mamata cancelled an appearance at the rally held by Abhishek to counter Shah's allegations levelled against her by Shah.
Speaking almost from the same spot where Shah delivered his Sunday speech, Abhisekh attacked the BJP and PM Modi saying he has done nothing for West Bengal after coming to power.
Abhisekh mocked Modi by comparing him with his aunt saying while he flies in private jets, goes abroad and changes wardrobe frequently, Mamata stays in a small house, wears handloom sarees and chappals.
Without naming Shah, he said those who come to Bengal like migratory birds, address a rally and return to Delhi will not win elections in the state.
Abhisekh also alleged Union minister of law and justice Sadanand Gowda's assets jumped from Rs. 9 crore to Rs. 20 crore in three months, and BJP must explain it.
Shah on Sunday had sounded the poll bugle to oust Trinamool from the state in the 2015 Kolkata Municipal Corporation and 2016 assembly elections and called for a Trinamool-free Bengal.
The BJP's rise in Bengal has sparked speculations about new equations in the state's political arena where the saffron brigade was only a fringe player until recently.
However, banking on Modi's poll promises on development, the party bagged an impressive 16.8% vote share in the April-May Lok Sabha elections. Even though the BJP won just two of the 42 seats, it made an impact.
Frequent clashes between BJP and Trinamool supporters have been reported in West Bengal since the polls.
The BJP chief's address came at a time when the ruling Trinamool is reeling under graft allegations in the multi-crore Saradha chit fund scam and the Burdwan blasts on October 2 that killed two alleged militants from Bangladesh.
Addressing the rally that saw a crowd of two lakh people, Shah had attacked Banerjee over the Saradha case, terrorist activities as well as lack of development in the state.
The TMC on Sunday had refused to attach much importance to Shah's rally and described it as a 'grand flop show'.
The city police, West Bengal fire department and the Kolkata Municipal Corporation had denied permission for the event at the Victoria House, where the ruling Trinamool usually organises its annual martyrs' day rally.
An intervention by the Calcutta high court saw the BJP getting the nod only at the eleventh hour.

BJP pulls up socks to take on AAPs #MufflerManBJP pulls up socks to take on AAP’s #MufflerMan
Neelam Pandey , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, December 01, 2014

The growing popularity of the Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) ‘MufflerMan’ on Twitter has made the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) jittery. The party is now desperately searching for ways to make its presence felt on the social media.
AAP’s social media campaign, ahead of the Delhi assembly elections, has been trending on Twitter with the hashtag ‘MufflerMan’ for many days now. According to sources, the state unit of the BJP has asked its members to focus more on Twitter by updating information and highlighting the work being carried out by the Modi government.
Also, for the first time, the party has asked the district units of the state BJP to come up with their own website to connect with local people. A senior BJP leader said that the Chandni Chowk district will launch its website on Tuesday.
“Hashtags including ‘Mufflerman’ and ‘Kejriwal Fir se’ have dominated the social media space for days now. Everyone is talking about it— whether or not they support AAP. Our presence on the social media is very poor and we are losing out on our youth support. A team is monitoring the work done by the social media so far and each district has been asked to create their own website,” said a senior BJP leader.
Sources said former AAP leader Ashwini Upadhyay, who is now the spokesperson for the Delhi BJP, is overseeing the entire process and has been tweeting regularly to counter claims made by the AAP.
“Workers have also been asked to trend topics relevant to the Delhi BJP to show the party’s presence on social networking sites. All councillors, former MLAs and party workers have been advised to use media tools, including Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp to reach out to the people. We need to reach out to the people in every way possible,” said a BJP leader.
“The AAP has been running a full-fledged campaign on social media wherein all the policies and decisions of the government are being debated and criticised. We need to respond by using the same platform,” said a senior BJP leader.

Below is the verbatim transcript of Rahul Shah's interview with CNBC-TV18.
On Thursday and Friday’s session, we saw some longs getting created in Tata Motors  and technically also it has given a breakout. So Tata Motors also can flare up from here, with a stoploss at Rs 528 and a target of Rs 555, I recommend a buy on Tata Motors.
I believe that public sector undertaking (PSU) banks have been in a positive territory for quite some time and I think on Friday’s session also we saw some longs getting created in Punjab National Bank . So I would buy PNB with a stoploss of Rs 1040 and target of Rs 1150.

Nickel down by 0.7% on overseas cuesNickel down by 0.7% on overseas cues
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Dec 01, 2014 12:15 PM IST
Taking weak cues from global markets and subdemand at domestic spot markets, nickel fell by 0.74% to Rs 1,0001.80 per kg in futures trade today as speculators reduced positions.
At the Multi Commodity Exchange, nickel for delivery this month shed Rs 7.50, or 0.74%, to Rs 1,001.80 per kg in a business turnover of 717 lots.
The metal for delivery in January next also fell by Rs 6.20, or 0.61%, to Rs 1,008 per kg in a turnover of four lots.
Analysts said the fall in nickel prices in futures trade was mostly in tandem with a weakening trend in the entire base metals pack at the London Metal Exchange (LME) as a rout in the energy market drove commodities lower and after data showed manufacturing activity slowed in China, the biggest consumer.
Further, low demand at domestic spot markets also weighed on prices, they said.

"Our thoughts go out to Phillip's family, friends, and the entire cricket community on this incredibly sad day."
There were no further details.
Hughes had spent a second night in a Sydney hospital in an induced coma after having emergency surgery to relieve pressure on his brain.

The batsman was struck on the head by a ball at the Sydney Cricket Ground, a devastating blow experts compared to the trauma suffered by victims of a car crash.
News of Hughes death followed calls by former players for the Australian team to abandon the first test match against India next week.
Questions about the response time of ambulances dispatched to the stadium were also raised.
The head of New South Wales Ambulance was to be hauled before the state health minister Jillian Skinner on Thursday after the ambulance authority issued conflicting statements about their response times.
The arrival of the first ambulance took 15 minutes, NSW Ambulance clarified in a statement on Wednesday.
The state's median response time for the highest priority "life-threatening cases" was just under eight minutes in 2013-14, according the authority's statistics.
"Due to the conflicting information distributed today by NSW Ambulance regarding (Tuesday's) response to the Sydney Cricket Ground, I will be meeting with NSW Ambulance Commissioner Ray Creen tomorrow to discuss the circumstances surrounding the incident," Skinner said.
Dr Peter Larkins, a leading sports physician, told Reuters: "Time is of the essence when your brain has suffered trauma."
Family and players had maintained their vigil at Hughes' bedside.

Breakfast recipe: Start your day with yummy and nutritious Banana Pancakes2 very ripe bananas, mashed
Extra bananas (2-3) for topping
Maple syrup
Olive oil for cooking
Method
* Mix the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and sugar to make the pancake mix. You can even store it in an air-tight jar and use it to make pancakes later.
* In a mixing bowl, whisk together the egg, milk and melted butter.
* Add to it the pancake mix and fold in together
* Add the mashed bananas and mix well
* Heat a flat pan with little oil
* Drop spoonful of batter onto the flat pan. It will spread a little on its own, you don’t need to spread it further. When bubbles appear on the surface of the pancake, flip them over and cook till they are golden brown on both sides.
* Repeat for the rest of the batter. I have a bigger pan so I make around 4 pancakes in one go.
* Serve with fresh banana slices, drizzled with maple syrup.
Happy Breakfast!

Jesse Ventura v. American Sniper: Unjust enrichment as a remedy in defamation casesBy Eugene Volokh November 28 Follow @volokhc
** FILE ** In this March 2, 1999 file photo, then-Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura presents his first State of the State address to a joint session of the legislature at the State Capitol in St. Paul, Minn. (AP Photo/Tom Olmscheid, File)
Ventura v. Kyle (D. Minn. Nov. 26, 2014) is the latest in ex-pro wrestler/Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura’s defamation lawsuit against the estate of Chris Kyle, the late author of American Sniper, the Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History. The case is mostly about the factual dispute, but there’s an interesting legal twist: Ventura sued not just for damage to his reputation from a passage in Kyle’s book, but also for unjust enrichment, on the theory that the allegedly false and defamatory passage increased Kyle’s profits.
The jury awarded plaintiff $500,000 for defamation, and $1,345,477.25 on the unjust enrichment theory. And the court held that this is constitutionally permissible:
Defendant also argues that allowing Plaintiff to recover damages via unjust enrichment, above and beyond those awarded by the jury for defamation, would run afoul of the First Amendment. True, the Supreme Court recently recognized that even some knowingly false speech is protected under the Constitution. See United States v. Alvarez, 132 S.Ct. 2537, 2551 (2012) (holding unconstitutional the Stolen Valor Act, which criminalized falsely claiming to have won the Congressional Medal of Honor). But defendants enjoy no carte blanche to lie with impunity. And Defendant is simply wrong to claim the First Amendment requires limiting the damages available for actionable false speech to the plaintiff’s loss. See, e.g., id. at 2547 (“Where false claims are made to effect a fraud or secure moneys or other valu[able] considerations, … it is well established that the Government may restrict speech without affronting the First Amendment.”) (emphasis added); see also Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 349 (1974) (punitive damages available for defamation when defendant knew statement was false or recklessly disregarded its truth).

Bank stocks cash in on oils wildslideSpiceJet shares continue to plunge; down 17 pct
Banking stocks received another booster from OPEC’s decision on oil production and the sharp decline in crude oil prices thereafter on Thursday, increasing hopes of a possible rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) at its bimonthly credit policy on December 2.
India’s largest lender by assets, State Bank of India (SBI) surged 5.4%, while other public-sector lenders such as Canara Bank, Punjab National Bank (PNB), and Bank of Baroda (BoB) rose 7.5-8%, lifting the bank index to a new record.
The Bank Nifty jumped 2.72% or 490.65 points to 18513.15. All 12 stocks on the index ended in the green. BoB surged to record highs, while PNB advanced to its highest level in over three years. SBI shares rose to near four-year high. Federal Bank rose to another record as did IndusInd Bank, Yes Bank, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank.
Analysts said the OPEC decision to maintain status quo on oil production – at 30 million barrels a day – is good news for oil-importing countries like India whose economic targets, including inflation, depend heavily on international oil prices.
Crude oil prices fell nearly 7% on Thursday to a four-and-a-half year low after the OPEC decided against a cut in oil production. Analysts were expecting OPEC to cut output by 1.5-2 million barrels per day in the wake of declining oil prices. Brent prices have fallen nearly 30% in the last three months, data showed.
“The stars are aligning for a rate cut,” said Aseem Dhru, MD and CEO of HDFC Securities. “The current slide in crude oil prices is no flash in the pan. It is a harbinger of future low prices. This will give the government the elbow room to reduce petroleum product prices further, which will further bring inflation down, and in turn clear the smog for the RBI governor,” Dhru added.
India was the world’s fourth-largest consumer of crude oil and petroleum products in 2013, after the US, China, and Japan. The country depends heavily on imported crude oil according to US Energy Information Administration (EIA).
The surprise rate cut by the Chinese central bank last week and the finance minister Arun Jaitley’s forthcoming meeting with the RBI governor ahead of the policy gave a fillip to bank stocks, analysts said.
“While we do not expect the RBI to drop its guard against long-term inflation pressures, we think the RBI will find it difficult to ignore the large easing in inflation momentum and is likely to tone down its hitherto hawkish policy rhetoric,” Barclays said in an investor note. There’s an “outside chance” of a cut next week “if Governor Rajan wants to surprise,” they said.
Governor Rajan has kept one of Asia’s highest interest rates unchanged since January after pledging to lower Indian inflation once and for all when he took over the central bank last year.

Maharashtra grape growers expect repeat of last seasons exportsuccessGold futures fall 1.13% on weak global cues
Maharashtra’s grape growers are expecting a repeat of their success in the previous season. Nearly four years after being rejected by the European Union on account of pesticide residue, a record 1.92 lakh tonne of grapes were exported by Indian traders to around 94 countries for the season of 2014.
Jagannath Khapre, president, All India Grape Exporters Association, says the recent spell of unseasonal rain should not have much impact and exports this time should be just as good as the previous year. “Harvesting has begun at some vineyards in Nashik and some flowering has been destroyed owing to rains. Around 10% of the crop has experienced cracking. But this should not impact the export scenario,” he said. Farmers have begun registering with APEDA under Grapenet, the online platform developed by Grapenet.
So far, around 14,000 registrations have been completed, Dr Sudhanshu, who handles the Mumbai region for APEDA, said. By mid-December this should go up to 25,000 registrations, senior officials said.
Last year, around 23,000 vineyards registered with Grapenet as opposed to 15,000 the previous season. Registrations have come in from  Latur, Satara, Ahmednagar, Nashik, Sangli and Pune.
Registering their farms on Grapenet is mandatory for farmers for export of grape. For the season of 2014, a record 1.92 lakh tonne of grapes was exported. Europe accounted for the largest share of 65,000 tonne. Nashik district is the largest producer of grapes with nearly 1.75 lakh acres under vineyards, while total acreage in Maharashtra is around 2.50 lakh acres. This year too, acreage is unlikely to change and has, in fact, risen by around 1-2% Khapre said.
According to him, new markets such as Russia and China also led to overall growth in grape export. Prices in the domestic market touched R30-35 per kg last year while the overseas markets commanded prices between R60-65 per kg.

Scrap Chennai Super Kings  observes apex courtprint
The Mudgal panel report cleared N Srinivasan (left) of spot fixing; however, Gurunath Meiyappan (centre) and Raj Kundra were not.
The Supreme Court on Thursday said Chennai Super Kings should be thrown out of the IPL without any further probe, virtually putting a question mark on the cash-rich league already battling allegations of betting and spot fixing.
The team’s all-powerful owner N Srinivasan, too, was dealt a blow when the court said the Indian cricket board should go ahead with its biennial elections but keep out those indicted by the Mudgal panel, which looked into charges of spot-fixing and betting that rocked Season 6 of the IPL.
The panel found Srinivasan, sidelined as the chief of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) by the court, guilty of failing to act against a player for violating conduct code.
The court also questioned the BCCI’s failure to act against Rajasthan Royals whose co-owner Raj Kundra was found involved in betting.
In the three-hour-long hearing, the court again raised the issue of the conflict of interest arising out of Srinivasan heading the BCCI and also owning CSK. A bench of justice TS Thakur and justice FMI Kalifullah said, “We want to know the real owners of the CSK.” It asked Srinivasan, who is India Cements managing director, to declare before it on December 1 — the next date of hearing —  all shareholding patterns in the company as well as the cricket franchise.
Srinivasan has told the court that India Cements owns CSK.
“We would like to know the share-holding of the company and the stake of Srinivasan and his family,” the court said. Srinivasan will also have to tell the court if the Rs. 400 crore invested by India Cements in CSK had the approval of the company’s board.
The court wanted to know if Srinivasan’s son-in-law Gurunath Meyiappan, found guilty of betting by the Mudgal panel, had a role in team selection as his wife was an India Cements board member. Meiyappan could be the ultimate controller of the team, it added.
Striking down Srinivasan and CSK captain MS Dhoni’s contention that Meiyappan was just a cricket enthusiast, the Mudgal panel had said he was a team official.
Pointing to the incestuous relationship between India Cements and BCCI, the court referred to Dhoni also the India captain, being a company vice-president.
“The point of distinction between the BCCI and the ICL is vanishing. There is hardly any distinction,” it said. The court was talking about Srinivasan’s special secretary Kasi Viswanathan, an India Cements employee, working for the BCCI.
The court said the non-players named by the panel should step aside as the board holds fresh elections during the twice postponed AGM on December 17.
The court said the BCCI didn’t have to wait for its verdict and should go ahead with action in accordance with the rules. “The BCCI must put an end to all the controversy,” the bench said. The board proposed a separate panel to hand out punishment to the indicted.

Comprehensive mobility plan for all cities advocatedTata Steel close to reopening its top iron ore mine
Metro Rail transport or building of more roads, flyovers and elevated highways may not necessarily be the answer to India’s urban transport problems, urban planning experts have opined.
They feel that efficient public transport is the solution and urged early intervention to enable the emerging cities to cope up with the problem to avoid the unwieldy experiences of mega and major cities.
The opinion came in the form of a set of 10 recommendations of the four-day long Urban Mobility India Conference, organized by Urban Development Ministry and the Institute of Urban Transport, that concluded yesterday.
The meet has recommended formulation of Comprehensive Mobility Plans for cities with over one lakh population focusing on introduction of public transport systems at an early stage to avoid the kind of problems that bigger cities are facing today.
The example of Naya Raipur, which had introduced Bus Rapid Transport System (BRTS) at an early stage in its development was highlighted as a good practice.
Noting that BRTS is in use in over 160 cities across the world, the participants noted that it may not have yielded desired results in some Indian cities, but it is workable and relevant.
The conference was attended by over 1,000 decision makers, experts, academia, industry delegates, civil society representatives and other stakeholders from 20 Indian states and 23 foreign countries. Over 70 presentations and 20 research papers were presented at the event.
O P Agarwal, Director-General of the Institute of Urban Transport, told PTI that Relevance of a particular mode of transport like the Metro or BRTS is guided primarily by the volume of movement of people and economics.
What is needed in the larger context is quick and reliable public transport in urban areas, he said.
“From the experience elsewhere in the World, it is evident that we need to focus on emerging cities with early intervention to ensure such options, Agarwal said.
The experts felt that building more roads, flyover and elevated roads may provide short term relief but they would soon be swamped by growing private motorized transport.
Merely building a high cost Metro Rail or a BRT would not be enough on its own, the conference said and recommended integrated multi-modal systems ensuring last mile connectivity for better outcomes.
The tendency is to finance mass transit from fare revenues and public susbisdy.
However, there is a class of beneficiaries who do not necessarily use the mass transit system, but still benefit from it. The reference was to those who own property near Metro stations where value goes up or those who use personal motor vehicles but benefit from reduced congestion due to others using the metro system. “Rightfully, they should also pay for it,” it said.
The conference also recommended that urban development needs to be centred around transport planning through formulation of Comprehensive Land Use and Mobility Plans.
Experts from Seoul, the city credited with having one of the best transport systems in the world, shared their experience of developing high quality public transport system combined with demolition of flyovers and elevated highways.
The conference has taken serious note of the lack of good data to support systematic investment planning and the complexities of collecting and managing such data.
It was pointed out that the data required is not available with one agency even at the city level posing serious challenges.
It recommended to the government to take up a pilot project to develop a database for one city, using smart phone based technologies, which could then be replicated by others, as a pre-condition to the smart cities programme.
The role of media in promoting awareness about sustainable transport was discussed with the recommendation that media should be co-opted at the stage of conceptualization of new initiatives for subsequent wider dissemination.

‘We trusted the government than the market’
The Centre will implement a ‘large number’ of legislative reforms recommended by the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission (FSLRC) ‘in the days to come’, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said here on Saturday.
Mr. Jaitley said a combination of legislative and administrative changes would be required for strengthening the regulatory framework in the financial sector. Four different groups had been set up to examine every aspect of the legislative changes recommended by the Commission.
“As the progress of reforms continues, I have not the least doubt that a large number of FSLRC recommendations will actually see implementation in the days to come,” said Mr. Jaitley at a seminar on ‘Indian Financial Code’, organised by the Institute of Company Secretaries of India and the BSE .
The Commission, chaired by Justice B. N. Srikrishna, which submitted its report on March 22, 2013, suggested drastic changes to the financial sector’s regulatory architecture. These include putting in place an Indian Financial Code that will replace the bulk of existing laws and creating a single regulator for pension, equity, insurance and commodities markets. It has also proposed to retain the Reserve Bank, but recommended to review its regulatory structure.
The Finance Minister said the country had moved away from State-regulated mechanism to a mechanism where the market was trusted and where there were professional regulators to deal with issues in sectors concerned.
“We need to institutionalise the mechanism. We need the best practices in India... the best global practices. The Commission’s report is an extremely important step in developing that framework,” said Mr. Jaitley, adding, “Somebody has to keep an eye on the markets... watch consumers interest and prevent aberrations.”
Mr. Jaitley said, “we trusted the government than the market…..and distribution of poverty got importance than the creation of wealth.” He added, “the State cannot not be the player and the decision maker or referee.”
Mr. Justice (Retd) Srikrishna, who spoke at the seminar, said that “many regulators are not doing enough for the consumer.” According to him, “financial sector providers should make clear and adequate disclosures…..regulator should be more effective and responsible to the Parliament and people at large.”
PTI adds
Hitting back at RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan for his views on the recommendations of the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission (FSLRC), Commission Chairman B. N. Srikrishna on Saturday said Dr. Rajan was once in favour of an appellate tribunal, but changed his stance after moving to the central bank.
“In his 2009 report ‘A 100 Steps’, Dr. Rajan wrote ‘regulatory action should be subject to appeal to the financial sector appellate tribunals’,”
Mr. Justice (Retd) Srikrishna said while adding this report was a guiding light for the Commission.
The FSLRC had suggested a non-sectoral, principle-based approach to revamp the existing framework. Among various suggestions, the FSLRC has recommended setting up a unified Financial Sector Appellate Tribunal (FSAT) that would hear all appeals against financial sector regulators.
It had also suggested creation of a unified financial sector regulator comprising SEBI, IRDA, FMC and part of RBI.
Dr. Rajan had earlier criticised FSLRC recommendations as ‘somewhat schizophrenic’.

Dubai to invest $32-billion to build worlds largest airportFile photo of Dubai Airport

To further secure its position as the world’s aviation hub, Dubai Airports is building a whopping USD 32—billion greenfield airport at the upcoming Dubai World Central, 30 km off the present international airport which already is the second busiest in the world.
The proposed new airport will become the world’s largest aviation facility on completion and will have five runways which all will be simultaneously operational, all A380-compatible with a length of 4.5 km each.
“We are planning a USD 32—billion brand new airport at the Dubai World Central at Al Maktoum, 30 km off the present Dubai facility. In the first phase, the new airport will be able to handle 120 million passengers, which will go up to 200 million by 2020, when the project is completed,” Dubai Airports Corporate Communications Head Julius Baumann told PTI.
“On completion, the new airport will be the world’s largest airport, with each concourse the size of seven football fields and have five runways which all will be simultaneously operational, all A380-compatible,” Mr. Baumann said.
The other features include 200 aircraft stands for wide bodied aircraft, four concourses connected via six airport trains to two terminals, which in turn will be linked to the city’s metro network. When complete, the mega-hub will have total annual capacity exceeding 200 million passengers and 12 million tonne of freight.
The existing Al Maktoum International opened its doors to passengers on October 27, 2013 and three airlines are operating from here. It has one A380 capable runway, 64 remote stands, one cargo terminal with annual capacity for 250,000 tonne and a fully operational passenger terminal building designed to accommodate 5 million passengers annually.
The Dubai International Airport is the world’s second busiest airport after the London Heathrow and is on course to become the global aviation hub, thanks to its geographical location and the availability of cheap fuel.
The first phase of the new airport includes a single A380 compatible runway, a passenger terminal with capacity of 5 million passengers which is expandable to 7 million; a cargo terminal with a capacity of 250,000 tonne per annum and expandable to 600,000 tonne and a 92-metre air traffic control tower.
The state-owned Dubai Airports already operates the Dubai International Airport in the heart of the Arabian megapolis and the Al Maktoum International Airport at the upcoming Dubai World Central (DWC).
The DWC is a 140 sq km new international city being built to de-congest the present city, Dubai Airports’ Marketing & Corporate Communications Manager Zaigham Ali said, adding the work on new airport will begin early next year.
Apart from the new airport plan, the Emirate is also expanding the Dubai International Airport with a USD 7.8 billion investment to take the capacity to 100 million by 2020. This project was started in 2011 and will be completed by 2016.
The expansion of the Dubai International include a new concourse (Concourse D), expansion of Terminal 2 to twice its current capacity, refurbishment of Terminal 1, and additional aircraft stands, taxiways and aprons among others.
Dubai International, Mr. Baumann said handled 66.43 million passengers in 2013, and has being growing 15.5 per cent per annum since its launch in 1960. In 2013, it was named the second busiest airport in the world after the London Heathrow.
Mr. Ali said India is the largest source market for the airport, with an airline network that connects Dubai with 18 cities in the country.
In 2013, the airport saw a 14.3 percent increase in passenger numbers from India at 8.5 million and in the first 9 months of this year, the number has already crossed 7 million.
Mr. Ali added the company is confident of crossing the last year’s mark this year.
Explaining the rationale for a gigantic new airport, Mr. Baumann said the airport’s forecast figures for unconstrained passenger traffic show 126 million passengers by 2020, and 300 million passengers by 2050.
Additionally, the Terminal 2 will double in capacity by 2015. Concourse D of the airport, slated to open by mid 2015, will provide for 100 more aircraft and taking the figure up to 80 million passengers.
In all, the expansion projects will take the airport’s passenger capacity to a little over 100 million passengers, Mr. Ali said.
With a built-up area of 1,972,474 sqm, the Dubai International Airport comprises three terminals and ranks among the world’s top two busiest airports for international passengers, serving over 125 airlines flying to over 260 destinations, as per the Airports Council International.
On the economic impact of the aviation sector in Baumann, quoting an Oxford Economics report said, aviation will contribute USD 53.1 billion to Dubai’s economy, which is 37.5 per cent to its GDP and will support over 750,000 jobs by the turn of 2020.
The aviation sector as a whole contributed USD 26.7 billion to the Dubai economy in 2013, which was almost 27 per cent of the national GDP and supported 416,500 jobs accounting for 21 per cent of the Emirates’ total employment.
Passenger traffic in September totalled 5,942,628 compared to 5,407,326 recorded in the same month last year, an increase of 9.9 per cent. January—September rose 6.2 per cent to 52,422,547, up from 49,379,165, while in 2013, the passenger traffic stood 66,431,533, up 15.2 per cent from 2012.

High-level panel counsels caution on GM food cropsagricultural research and technology
Suggests setting up of special environment courts
The government-appointed High Level Committee (HLC) to review environmental laws, while proposing a near complete overhaul of the regulatory system, has sounded a note of caution on genetically modified (GM) food crops.
In a report submitted recently on its review of six laws, the HLC headed by former Cabinet Secretary T.S.R. Subramanian, said the potential consequences of mindless use of science and technology could possibly be illustrated by referring to the potential for medium/ long-term adverse affects through unprepared introduction of GM food crops. While other Ministries naturally would aggressively push for early field trials and induction, the HLC said the role of the Environment Ministry may have to be one of being a Devil’s Advocate to advise due caution. It said that Europe does not permit field trials, and that the average Indian farm is of very small size (which could lead to severe adverse impact on biodiversity through gene-flow) and also noted that there are no independent expert agencies in the country, and perhaps the Ministry of Environment may ask for greater assurance in respect of potential adverse effects in the medium and long run. The HLC takes this aspect of assurance and good faith further in its new proposed law, the Environment Laws (Management) Act (ELMA). The new law prescribes new offences, as also for establishing special environment courts presided over by a session’s judge and higher penalties.
The proposed new law will have an overriding effect on all other relevant laws. However, the proposed legislation prescribes that the application for environmental clearances expects the applicant to be honest and truthful — the concept of ‘utmost good faith’ is statutorily introduced, and the consequences of breach are also set out.
The Committee which was criticized for inadequate consultation and its brief time frame of three months, however, felt that most pending issues were addressed constructively, and equally a roadmap has been suggested for continuous monitoring of the legal, legislative and management framework in this field. It noted that among the most important gaps in the present regime, the issue of enforcement of conditions of approval remains nearly totally unattended and needs to be addressed effectively. It called for the setting up of a new All India Service called the Indian Environment Service. The present monitoring regime is heavily dependent on field verification through ‘inspectors’. It also noted that the cause of environment preservation is not adequately met by the present monitoring methods.
The HLC has said forest areas with 70 per cent or more canopy cover and protected areas should be notified as ‘no go’ areas and suggested a slew of other measures for forest protection. However, it said that where there are considerations of national interest and issues relating to safeguarding the territorial integrity of the country, activities may be permitted in such areas subject to the prior and specific approval of the Union Cabinet.
In keeping with the Centre’s desire to dilute the Forest Rights act (FRA), the HLC has said that for linear projects, it is recommended that FRA needs amendment to consider removal of the condition of Gram Sabha approval. However, there is already an order from the Eenvironment Ministry to this effect. It said that forest and environmental clearances should time bound and streamlined.
While environmentalists have fought for increased regulation in wildlife areas during festivals, the HLC says India has a varied and glorious cultural tradition. While there are many national festivals, there are also localised festivals which are of great local importance in different States. Nature and animal worship has been part of the national culture. Thus, for example Nag Panchami in many States is celebrated and snakes worshipped during five days in Shravan month, as a “thousands years-old’ tradition. It is to be noted that the snakes are never harmed — indeed are worshipped during this period. A dispensation in the various Schedules should be permitted to take into account such local practices, and reflect them in their approved schedules, through gazette notification, the HLC said.
It called for Wildlife Management plans to be made mandatory, the demarcation of eco sensitive zones to be enforced around all protected areas and proposed the banning of polythene bags and plastic bottles into Protected areas. It has proposed to create new agencies, the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) at the national level and the State Environment Management Authority (SEMA) for each State as the pivotal authorities to process applications for a one-window composite environmental clearance. The NEMA and SEMA will replace the Central Pollution Control Board and State Pollution Control Boards.
On the question of public hearing, the HLC recommends that the method of public consultation prescribed in the existing notification should continue with the modification that only environmental, rehabilitation and resettlement issues are captured in the public hearing. A mechanism should be put in place to ensure that “only genuine local participation” is permitted. The extant provision of dispensing with public hearing should be continued only in respect of situations when it is reported that local conditions are not conducive to the conduct of hearing, or in the matters of projects of strategic importance and national importance. There is no necessity for public hearing in locations where settlements are located away from the project sites.
It also takes away the role of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) which under the proposed ELMA, will only be able to judicially review the decision of Appellate Boards. The Special Environment Courts shall dispose of cases expeditiously and normally within six months. Aggrieved parties may approach an appellate board presided over by a retired high court judge. The HLC also called for streamlining of the assessment process, preparation a perspective coal plan from a sustainable point of view, creating an Environment Reconstruction Fund for facilitating research, standard setting, education and related matters, and putting in place systems for managing solid waste.

Govt s media managers set to turn news makersGovt's media managers set to turn news makers
Shreya Jai | New Delhi Dec 01, 2014 12:58 AM IST
If journalism is about breaking news, you could soon see the government playing journalist, lifting the veil of secrecy and making even sensitive information public. The media managers of the government will themselves post online the agenda for Cabinet meetings, inter-ministerial discussions and other key departmental work.
The Press Information Bureau (PIB), the government wing for dissemination of information to the media, is undergoing a massive revamp - its online functioning will be strengthened through a wide social media presence, refurbished interactive website, instant mass communication and real-time updates.
The PIB website, pib.nic.in, which gets close to 30,000 hits a day, will be made technically sound to handle more traffic and multimedia content like photos, voice files, videos and live feeds. The idea is to make the site function like a news wire so that speculative reporting can be curbed.
And this overhaul is coming at a time when two skilled media managers - Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, also the information & broadcasting minister - are at the helm of affairs of the government.
"The PIB website is being redesigned and it will don a completely new avatar by the end of this financial year. It will be more interactive, with multimedia releases and social media integration," said a government official, adding a mobile app was also underway. PIB is present on social media platforms since December 2010, when it joined Twitter under @PIBIndia handle. But it was in the past three months that its count of followers jumped by 100,000 to 330,000.
"We set up a social media cell two years ago but there has been a lot of emphasis on social media presence since the new government took charge at the Centre earlier this year," said a senior press information officer (PIO).
At present, the social media cell has three members - a director and two young information services officers. Officials close to the development say PIB is planning to outsource the management of its media activities and trend analyses to an agency. And PIB officials will also be trained to use social media more effectively. The bureau will also register on Google +, Facebook, Instragram and other emerging platforms.
PIB also has a YouTube channel, where important briefings are uploaded for mass information. Under the expansion plan, the channel will have live feeds and video animations to explain government policies and programmes to general public.
PIOs will also be trained to speedily send text messages and live feeds to news reporters. Since the new government took charge, some PIOs have been proactive in use of technology for efficient dissemination of information and tracking of news.
Government officials said the plan was to get in sync with the prime minister's 'Digital India' dream.
To reach out to faraway and rural areas of the country, PIB will also take the help of regional offices for public information campaign and involve community radio.
Through all media divisions of the government - the Directorate of Advertising and Publicity, Doordarshan, All India Radio and its song and drama division - PIB's new avatar will not only handle the media but will work as the apex body for information broadcasting in the country.
As a senior official puts it, this government aims not only to comment on the news but be the news maker, literally.
THE NEW FACE OF PIB
Going social: Will have a redesigned website with social media integration and search tools; will be present on popular social media platforms - with accounts in Hindi and other regional languages as well
 
Wider lens: Will monitor flow of government information more efficiently
 
Tech upgrade: Will give multimedia releases, live feeds and updates; will generate audio-visual content on government policies - for the media and common man
 
Announcements: Agenda for Cabinet and inter-ministerial meetings to be uploaded on the website
 
For the masses: Will build platforms for better citizen engagement and connect

China November Manufacturing Activity Falls to Six-Month Low: PMIFed Faces Big Decision Over a Few Choice Words
Beijing: Growth in Chinese factories stalled in November as output shrank for the first time in six months, reinforcing expectations that authorities will roll out more aggressive stimulus measures after unexpectedly cutting interest rates to shore up growth.
The final HSBC/Markit China Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) edged down to 50.0 in November, a six-month low and right on the boom-bust level that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
The reading was unchanged from a preliminary "flash" finding and down from a final 50.4 in October.
Output fell to 49.6, the worst reading since May, as companies scaled back production in the face of "muted growth in new work" and subdued market conditions, HSBC/Markit said on Monday.
Hurt by a sagging property market, unsteady export growth and cooling domestic demand and investment, China's economic growth is expected to slow to a 24-year low of 7.4 per cent this year, though the fourth quarter is shaping up to be possibly weaker than earlier thought.
After months of sticking to more modest stimulus measures, China surprised global financial markets by cutting interest rates on November 21 to spur activity and help bring down financing costs for cash-starved companies which are struggling to pay off mountains of debt.

I Do Day : Nearly 4 000 people tie the knot in Rioprint
It was Rio's biggest mass wedding: a total of 1,960 couples who exchanged vows Sunday in a hall next to the famous Maracana stadium.
The big event brought out a whopping 12,000 people, between brides and grooms, friends and family and authorities -- including a pack of judges, a Catholic priest and an evangelical Christian pastor.
Dubbed "I Do Day," the event was sponsored by authorities to encourage many people who might not be able to afford to marry if they had to pay for licenses and banquet halls.
The megacrowd gathered in the venue which is often used for major concerts, couples tied the knot and friends took in a concert by samba star Dudu Nobre. Guests also got a free ride on local trains -- nicknamed the "I Do Day Train" just for the occasion.

10:50am Mangalore Chemicals in focus
Shares in Mangalore Chemicals and Fertilizers (MCF) jumped 15 percent after the company informed the stock exchanges this morning that liquor baron Vijay Mallya had stepped down from its board with immediate effect.
Mallya, whose UB Group is going through choppy times following a debt crisis at grounded airliner Kingfisher, was facing a tough battle to retain control of MCF after rival Deepak Fertilizers had initiated a hostile takeover of the firm.
UB Group (which holds a 22 percent stake in MCF) had later teamed up with Zuari (which has 16 percent) and announced a joint open offer to acquire additional stake in the firm to rival the challenge from Deepak, which had successfully acquired 25 percent in MCF and announced its own open offer.
10:30am HSBC PMI improves
Manufacturing operating conditions in India improved for the thirteenth month in a row in November, supported by stronger growth of output and new work intakes. Foreign orders and buying activity also rose during the month, while employment remained broadly stable, said HSBC in its report.
Rising from 51.6 to 53.3, the headline seasonally adjusted HSBC India Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) - a composite indicator designed to give an accurate overview of manufacturing operating conditions – reached a 21-month peak in November.
"Manufacturing activity accelerated further in November led by higher output and new orders. Domestic orders saw the biggest increase, even as new export orders continued to be strong. The sharp rise in input prices was surprising, but future prints may be lower as falling commodity prices eventually lead to softer intermediate good prices," said Pranjul Bhandari, Chief India Economist at HSBC.
10:00am Market Check
Equity benchmarks remained lacklustre in trade with the Sensex falling 18.63 points to 28675.36 and the Nifty declining 1.45 points to 8589.70. The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices were marginally in green.
About 1157 shares have advanced, 875 shares declined, and 54 shares are unchanged on the Bombay Stock Exchange.
Ridham Desai, Morgan Stanley says the brokerage house expects the bull market to continue in 2015. "Indian equities are benefiting from the start of a new growth cycle, a benign global environment resulting in a positive shift in terms of trade and reforms, which can lift India's potential growth rate," he reasoned.

Samsung to launch Tizen smartphone in India:...Samsung Electronics Co Ltd plans to launch a new sub-$100 smartphone running on its own Tizen operating system in India later this month.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
SEOUL: South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd plans to launch a new sub-$100 smartphone running on its own Tizen operating system in India later this month, South Korea's Maeil Business Newspaper said on Monday.
The paper, a local business daily, said Samsung will hold a press conference on Dec. 10 to launch its first Tizen smartphone, to be called the Z1. A Samsung Electronics spokeswoman declined to comment.
Samsung had initially planned to launch a Tizen smartphone in Russia in the third quarter but scrapped the plan. The firm said at the time that it wanted to further enhance the ecosystem behind Tizen. Only a handful of devices, including the firm's smartwatch products, currently run on the platform.
The majority of Samsung's mobile devices are based on Google's Android platform. The South Korean firm's push to develop its own operating system is part of efforts to reduce dependence on the US firm, but delays in product launches have undercut expectations.

NEW DELHI: Shares of gems and jewellery business rallied as much as 20 per cent in trade on Monday, after the government unexpectedly scrapped a rule imposed in August last year mandating that a fifth of all the precious metal imported should be re-exported.
Reacting to the news, Shree Ganesh Jewellery and Gitanjali Gems rallied as much as 20 per cent, followed by rally in Titan Company, TBZ, Tara Jewels, PC Jeweller, etc.
Shree Ganesh Jewellery was locked in upper circuit at Rs 27.90, up 20 per cent, followed by Gitanjali Gems which was up 19.96 per cent at Rs 60.10.
Titan Company soared 6.1 per cent at Rs 392.75, TBZ 15.12 per cent to Rs 173.40, Tara Jewels 7.3 per cent higher at Rs 96.50 and PC Jeweller 10.2 per cent higher at Rs 266.15.
The Reserve Bank of India issued a notification late on Friday withdrawing the norm imposed on August 14, 2013, to reduce the yawning current account deficit and relieve pressure on the rupee that had weakened sharply.
At the time, emerging markets had come under pressure because of talk about the US Federal Reserve winding down its stimulus programme.
"It has been decided by the government of India to withdraw the 20:80 scheme and restrictions placed on import of gold ," the Reserve Bank said.
The rule, along with the high customs duty of 10% - raised in stages to that level last year - had led to a rise in smuggling, besides distorting imports, ET reported.
The government said the current account deficit is no longer a concern so there is no reason to keep the curb in place, added the report.

Top 13 stocks expected to be upgraded in Q2Corporate EPS downgrades fly thick and fast, market cool

(Among Nifty stocks, there…)
A spate of disappointing corporate earnings for the quarter ended September 2014, thanks to a slow economic recovery, forced analysts to downgrade the FY15 earnings per share ( EPS ) estimates of about 60% of the top 300 companies (covered by at least 5 analysts). Of the 181 downgrades, 124 are mid-caps while the remaining are large-caps. Stocks, mostly belonging to consumer goods, cement, PSU banks and telecom and utilities suffered the maximum downgrades.
Some of the stocks which have been downgraded include Axis Bank , ABB , Aditya Birla Nuvo , Jindal Steel and DLF. Among Nifty stocks, there were 14 upgrades and 32 downgrades. The earning estimates of companies such as Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki and Sun Pharma have been upgraded signifi cantly.
Analysts said the consensus on earnings downgrades for FY15 & FY16, post Q2 FY15 results, belies current market euphoria. "It appears that the market is setting its sights on the growth prospects beyond FY16, ignoring the current earning downgrades and perceiving lower risk premium on India, given the improving macros, political stability, decisive governance and benign external sector," said Vinod Karki, VP-Strategic Research Group, ICICI Securities. "Assuming lower infl ation, anticipated rate cut, improving consumer sentiment, and investment revival are expected to fuel earning upgrades in FY16."

Samsung mobile chief survives reshuffle despite falling profits

Seoul: Samsung Electronics defied speculation it would drop the head of its underperforming mobile division, as the Samsung Group's heir apparent opted to keep the man his ailing father appointed while the patriarch's future is uncertain.
Staff at Samsung have been waiting nervously for the annual reshuffle after a weak smartphone performance and the worst earnings in three years, with many fearing for their jobs, but embattled co-chief executive JK Shin now knows he will continue to head the Electronics unit's mobile division despite sagging smartphone sales.
Semiconductor business chief Kwon Oh-hyun and consumer electronics head Yoon Boo-keun also kept their jobs.
Staff at Samsung have been waiting nervously for the annual reshuffle after a weak smartphone performance and the worst earnings in three years.
#samsung mobile chief #samsung #samsung reshuffle
Analysts said Jay Y Lee, likely successor and only son of group patriarch Lee Kun-hee, opted to keep his father's key lieutenants in place to ensure stability and consolidate his own position.
"With Samsung undergoing major changes in the midst of the succession process, like selling affiliates and listing units, it would have been too unsettling to change leadership," said Chung Sun-sup, head of local research firm Chaebul.com.
"And without a signal that Chairman Lee Kun-hee has stepped back for good, it might have been too much for Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee to change the people his father put in position."
Park Ju-gun, head of corporate watchdog CEO Score, said Lee junior likely needs more time to shore up his position in South Korea's largest conglomerate with his father still in hospital after a heart attack in May.
"It was too soon for him to take a big risk at this point," Park said.
Samsung Group Senior Vice President Lee June reminded reporters that Shin was "a major contributor in Samsung Electronics' emergence as the top global player in the handsets business" and would be given an opportunity to turn the business around.
Squeezed by Chinese rivals like Xiaomi Technology Co Ltd at the low end and Apple Inc's iPhones at the top, Samsung Electronics' share of the smartphone market has shrunk year-on-year for the last three quarters, leading to speculation Shin's days were numbered.
Samsung Electronics insiders said employees' focus was now on any follow-up management appointments and reorganization plans due for the firm later this week.

ET Awards 2014: Small steps will lead to big...Bharti Airtel
(This govt will take what…)
MUMBAI: Impatient industry leaders who streamed in large numbers into the ET Awards for Corporate Excellence on Saturday looking for announcements on big-bang reforms from the top ministers in the Narendra Modi government were instead told that they could expect a series of measures that will leave a lasting impression.
This government will take what may look like small steps, but will push through important legislation and clear regulatory cobwebs which are crippling businesses, and their impact will be such that the 'Make in India' project of PM Modi will become a reality rather than remain a slogan.
Liberalisation of investment regulations will be dictated by national interest instead of aiming to just enrich a few, and leave out millions as in the past when employment generation lagged economic growth.
"The objective was capacity building, so at 49% (in defence) we have had a reasonable good initial period," said Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. "I do not think there are too many amongst the captains of the industry here who are going to invest 49% in defence only to become minority shareholders.
People are approaching Indian corporates for joint ventures."
The proof of the pudding is in the eating, Power & Coal Minister Piyush Goyal told the galaxy of CEOs and entrepreneurs during a panel discussion, which included Bharti Airtel's Sunil Mittal, ITC's YC Deveshwar and Diageo Plc's Ivan Menezes.
"We sorted out a 40-year story in less than 40 days," said minister Piyush Goyal.
"I have yet to read one editorial which has been able to find flaw in that ordinance," said Power & Coal Minister Piyush Goyal. "We stand for whatever we say and we will take every step required to meet expectations of people and get achhe din."
The Lok Sabha should pass the Bill in the next few days, Goyal said. When asked if the joint session route could be used in case the government experienced difficulty in getting the Bill through Rajya Sabha, Goyal said the government would explore "any route" to get the Bill through.
Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar said the country's defence policy will be tailored in such a way that the world's biggest importer of defence equipment will produce more of its needs at home, even if it is done by a multinational company. "We are working on policies where Make in India becomes a reality in this sector," said Parrikar. "If we are the biggest customer, why cannot I get things done in my country, at least initially even if it is by global (companies)."
Industry captains who were worried that 'big-bang' reforms are absent and that the government was sounding nationalistic in a throwback to the days of socialism were assured that national interest need not necessarily be anti-business and trade. Although the postponement of the Trade Facilitation Agreement under the World Trade Organization caused a lot of anxiety, the way the government handled the issue leads one to believe that the nation is in safe hands, said Sunil Mittal, founder of Bharti Airtel.
"At one point in time (I felt) that either the WTO will collapse or we will be isolated in the whole process and that other countries will move forward," said Mittal. "This government showed nerves of steel. When the whole world, and this time mind you most emerging countries were also not behind us, then to stand alone and say we want to protect our agriculture, we want to protect our procurement... I think you have done a fantastic job. I personally feel we are blessed to have a government like this."
  Be it defence, retail, power or coal, the common thread of policymaking will be that there is a level-playing field and there is no favouritism towards any single group, or an individual.
The government will take time to decide, but it will come up with a foolproof mechanism.
"It is the role of technology which is very difficult for anyone to put a brake on," Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharam said, when questioned on the talk of restrictions on ecommerce. "But at the same time, I would not want to rush in to say either way because our position, on say multi-brand retail, is very clear.
But nothing more at this stage."
Indeed, as the debate progressed, it became evident that chief executives are worried more about the nitty-gritty of doing business which the Modi government is focusing on rather than limits on foreign ownership, and dominance of inefficient state-run enterprises in many fields.
"We need 250,000 approvals in one year... licences and approvals in one year," said Menezes of Diageo, which bought United Spirits in a $3-billion transaction. "I would hope with the direction we are taking, that number comes down drastically. I mean that will unleash economic activity, growth that will cause us to invest. It will raise more employment."
Part of the industry's worries were addressed right on the spot.

Paint Manufacturers Hit 52-Week High on Falling Crude PricesPaint Manufacturers Hit 52-Week High on Falling Crude Prices

Singapore, Dec 1:  
Emerging Asian currencies from Malaysia’s ringgit to South Korea’s won hit new lows on Monday, as data highlighted the economic toll wrought by plunging oil prices, sending the dollar broadly higher.
The ringgit underperformed regional peers, falling to around 5-year lows as investors worried that US crude’s slide to a five-year low will hurt growth in Malaysia, a net oil exporter and major palm oil producer.
South Korea’s won touched its weakest in more than 15 months after data showed an unexpected slide in November exports and as the yen fell to its lowest in more than seven years against the dollar.
Deflation woes
The sell-offs in the region’s currencies come as sliding oil prices continue to stir deflation fears in the euro zone and Japan.
“Falling oil price reflects partly growth concerns, which are Asian FX negative. The monetary stance is expected to shift to easing bias in the medium-term,’’ said Andy Ji, Asian currency strategist for Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Singapore.
China’s manufacturing data
Earlier on Monday, China reported slower growth in its manufacturing sector in November, suggesting the world’s second-largest economy is still losing momentum.
China’s yuan eased to two-month lows after the central bank set another weaker midpoint. The Indonesian rupiah did not escape the grim mood, skidding to an 11-month low as October exports fell more than expected.
Commonwealth Bank’s Ji expects markets to increase the odds of a rate cut in Malaysia amid the deterioration in the trade sector, adding that in general the dollar is likely to remain firm this week.
Traders will also be focused on central bank meetings of the euro zone, England and Australia this week.
Ringitt plunges
The ringgit lost as much as 1.6 per cent to 3.4375 per dollar, its weakest since February 2010. The Malaysian currency came under pressure from dollar demand linked to daily-fixing, while the central bank was suspected of intervening to limit the unit’s depreciation, traders said.
Won drops
The won fell as much as 1.1 per cent to 1,120 per dollar, its weakest since August 23, 2013, after data showed exports in November unexpectedly tumbled their most in more than 1-1/2 years, increasing pressure for further rate cuts.
Rupiah falls
The rupiah slid 0.6 per cent to 12,270 per dollar, its weakest since January 7. The official Jakarta Interbank Spot Dollar Rate (JISDOR), which the central bank had launched last year in an effort to manage exchange rate fluctuations, was fixed at 12,264 rupiah per dollar, weaker than Wednesday’s 12,196.
Indonesia’s exports in October fell a worse-than-expected 2.21 per cent from a year earlier, while a survey showed manufacturing activity contracted in November to its weakest level since early 2011.

New Delhi: The BSF troopers gave "a befitting reply" when Pakistan violated the ceasefire, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said on Monday.
"Our BSF jawans are the most concerned about 'Rashtriya Swabhiman' (national pride). No power can cast an evil eye on our country," said Rajnath Singh at the Border Security Force (BSF) Raising Day Parade programme at the BSF Camp in Chhawla in New Delhi.
"BSF jawans gave a befitting reply when Pakistan violated ceasefire. People of India are by and large peaceful by nature but if anyone dares to challenge our sense of pride BSF will give a befitting reply," he said.

Highlighting the force's role during war time, he said that the BSF has always been the first line of defence.
He added that a booklet giving an account of all the sacrifices made by the BSF men should be published.
"I am aware of your grievances and the government is sensitive to the issues facing the BSF," he added.
He also said that the force should play an active role in stopping cattle smuggling at India-Bangladesh border.
The minister also paid tributes to the troopers and officers who sacrificed their lives in the line of duty.

Will try to introduce GST Bill this session:...Arun Jaitley
("We will try and introduce…)
NEW DELHI: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today expressed hope that the much-awaited GST Bill, which provides for a uniform indirect tax structure, would be introduced in the current winter session of Parliament.
"We will try and introduce GST (Goods and Services Tax ) Bill in this session...GST Bill would be taken up by the Cabinet after Empowered Committee (of state finance Minister) meeting on December 12," he said here.
The government has proposed to implement GST from April 1, 2016, and the new Finance Commission may be set up ahead of its schedule to look into the issues related to the new indirect tax regime.
The GST will subsume indirect taxes like excise duty and service tax at the central level and VAT on the states front, besides local levies.
There are differences between the Centre and states on some issues with regard to the implementation of GST that includes the revenue neutral rate and keeping petroleum, liquor out of the ambit.
While a sub-committee on GST has suggested that the revenue neutral rate of GST be pegged at about 27 per cent, the states are yet to decide on it.
It had suggested states GST at 13.91 per cent and Central GST at 12.77 per cent.
Besides, states have been demanding that petroleum, alcohol and tobacco should be kept out of the purview of GST.
The GST Constitutional Amendment Bill, which was introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2011, had lapsed and the NDA government will be required to come up with a fresh bill.
The GST rollout has missed several deadlines because of lack of consensus among states over certain crucial issues on the new tax regime.

Will introduce GST Bill in Winter Session: JaitleyWill try to introduce GST Bill in Winter Session: Jaitley
Arup Roychoudhury | New Delhi Dec 02, 2014 12:45 AM IST
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley reiterated on Monday that the government will try to introduce the constitutional amendment Bill on a Goods and Service Tax in the ongoing winter session of Parliament, after state finance ministers meet next  week  on a proposal by the Centre in this regard.
“The Bill would be taken up by the Cabinet after the Empowered Committee (of state finance Minister) meeting on December 12,” he said here in New Delhi.
"We will try to introduce the constitutional amendment bill on GST in this session," Jaitley said at an event organised by the Competition Commission Of India (CCI).
The government has planned a heavy reform agenda for the winter session, including amendment to land acquisition act, the long-pending insurance bill and the constitutional amendments to GST.
Various policymakers, including Minister Of State for Finance Jayant Sinha, believe that GST can be in force by its deadline of April 1, 2016, inspite of differences with the states on keeping alcohol and petroleum products as part of the GST, and on the issue of compensation.
A senior government official said last week that the government is looking at presenting the constitutional amendments in the cabinet after December 12, and then table them in Parliament.
Separately, on the sidelines of the CCI event, a senior regulatory source said that the final order on Sun Pharmaceuticals' acquisition of Ranbaxy will come in a few days time. 
"We expect the final order on the merger of Sun Pharmaceuticals and Ranbaxy by Wednesday," said the official who did not wish to be named.

With the investment limit for foreign institutional investors (FIIs) in many large-cap stocks getting exhausted, these are turning their focus to names in the mid-cap and, selectively, the small-cap space.
In the past month, five companies — CEAT, Just Dial, Edelweiss Financial, Bajaj Corp and Pennar Industries — got Reserve Bank of India (RBI) approval to raise their FII-investment limits. Power Grid Corporation has been added to the FII-ban list, restricting foreign participation.
Just Dial saw its FII shareholding limit raised to 75 per cent. For Bajaj Corp and CEAT, it has been raised to 49 and 45 per cent, respectively. Edelweiss Financial Services saw the limit raised for a second time this year —once in April to 28 per cent and another last month to 40 per cent. For Pennar Industries, the limit is now 35 per cent.
“The way the headline indices have moved, there is not much headroom left in the large-cap space any more. Investors looking for higher returns will have to move beyond these stocks,” said Piyush Garg, executive vice-president, ICICI Securities.
According to RBI's website, 24 per cent is the default limit for FII investment in a company. For state-owned banks, the limit is 20 per cent. This upper limit can be raised by the central bank, subject to a sectoral cap or a statutory ceiling, after approval from the company's board.
Analysts said large-cap names had seen their share of the rally, with most stocks close to hitting the upper limit of FII investment. Of particular interest for FIIs in the large-cap are financial sector stocks, which have seen a significant rise.
The Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) recently cleared a rise in FII limit in the Street favourite, HDFC Bank, to 74 per cent. Another favourite, IDFC, is still in the FII-ban list. Axis Bank and YES Bank are close to their FII limits. Interestingly, the latter saw its FII shareholding fall to 46.3 per cent, opening it to FII-buying last month. The FII investment limit in the stock is fixed at 49 per cent.
Lupin, which had applied to RBI for a rise in the limit to 49 per cent in October 2013, received the FIPB approval last month.
Experts believe stocks in the mid-cap segment can move up by as much as 50-100 per cent, on the back of the capacity expansion and volumes growth expected in the next two to three quarters. However, the hurdle FIIs could face in this space, despite good valuations, is the lack of liquidity. “The bigger concern for these stocks is the lack of liquidity in these. When investors look to exit these stocks, it should be without too much of an impact cost because liquidity in these stocks is not sustainable over a longer period of time,” said Vivek Mahajan, head of research, Aditya Birla Money.
However, some in the market believe the liquidity issue might be resolved, albeit temporarily, with an increase in FII participation. Typically, a stock with high FII interest also tends to bring in more of retail and high net worth individual investors, they said.
With the recent decline in crude oil prices, mid-cap stocks in the petrochemical space such as paint companies could see higher FII participation, said observers. Similarly, stocks in the automobile ancillary space and tyre sector could also be on the FII-buy list, along with those in the cement sector.

JSW Steel defers Italian steel co acquisitionJSW Steel defers Italian steel co acquisition
Press Trust of India | Kolkata Dec 01, 2014 11:25 AM IST
JSW Steel Ltd, the third largest Indian steel maker, today said it has deferred the proposed acquisition of Italy's Lucchini SpV.
"For the time being, plans for India is much stronger and larger. We want to focus in India.... We have deferred our decision to invest in the Italian project," JSW Steel chairman and managing director Sajjan Jindal said.
He was speaking on the sidelines of inauguration of Ispat Pragati Bhawan, the new office of Institute of Steel Development & Growth (Insdag) in the city.
In September, Jindal had told reporters that JSW has offered less than $100 million for three mills of the insolvent Lucchini and it was in a position to win it.
The company recently also gave a clarification in the bourses saying, "In line with our long-term strategy to acquire finishing mills near to the market, we have submitted a binding bid for takeover of Rolling Mills of the Piombini Plant of Lucchini in Italy subject to certain terms and conditions. We are yet to get the response on this bid."
Lucchini, with a steel capacity of about 2.5 mt, was owned by Russia's Severstal but had to be declared insolvent in 2012 following which the government placed it under special administration and started the process to find buyers.
JSW currently has a total installed steel making capacity of 14.3 million tonnes in India.

Maharashtra government likely to re-open Maval firingcaseWritten by Parthasarathi Biswas | Mumbai |
Posted: December 1, 2014 12:56 pm | Updated: December 1, 2014 3:38 pm
On the eve of the December session of the state legislature, the Devendra Fadnavis led government might order for re-opening of the 2011 Maval firing case. Mava’s MLA Bala Bhedge, who is tipped to be included in the state cabinet, said that he has taken up the case with the chief minister and other senior party leaders already.
Three farmers had lost their lives and a host of others were injured when police had opened fire at a group of protesting farmers on the expressway. The farmers were protesting against the proposed closed water pipeline to supply water from the Pavana dam to Pimpri Chinchwad. The erstwhile deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had supported the project.
After the firing, the state government had formed a single judge commission to investigate the incident whose report was submitted subsequently. However no action was taken on it.
Bhegde and other party leaders said that they want to take up the case and see that justice is done to the farmers. “I will be speaking to the corporation to ensure the next of kin of the slain farmers are given government jobs,” said Bhegde.

Trinamool targets Amit Shah  alleges he has links with Sahara money laundering caseComments
Trinamool Congress on Monday launched an offensive on the Bharatiya Janata Party in Parliament and held a rally in Kolkata to counter the saffron party president Amit Shah's criticism of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Sunday.
Facing heat over the Saradha scam, Trinamool targeted the BJP inside as well as outside Parliament by alleging that a diary of jailed Sahara group chief Subrata Roy contained the name of a senior leader of the saffron party, leading to clashes and a walkout.
Placard-wielding Trinamool MPs held a demonstration outside Parliament demanding a probe into alleged links between Shah and the Sahara money laundering case.
Trinamool sought to corner the ruling party in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha by displaying symbolic red diaries.
The Trinamool members alleged the diary was recovered from Sahara chief Subrata Roy by the Central Bureau of Investigation during searches at Sahara's office and claimed it contained the name of a BJP leader.
Attack in Parliament
In Lok Sabha, Trinamool MPs rushed to the Well shouting slogans, carrying red-coloured diaries which had "Sahara" written on it. They demanded that PM Modi should explain what action the CBI has taken after the name allegedly figured in the diary. They later staged a walkout.
Bandyopadhyay had given a notice for suspension of Question Hour to discuss the issue which was rejected by Speaker Sumitra Mahajan.
"They (Trinamool MPs) have decided not to follow the rules," she said.
Parliamentary affairs minister M Venkaiah Naidu said according to rules no member can name anyone who is not a member of the House. They also cannot display placards, he said.
To this, the Speaker said the name of the BJP leader would not go on record.
After protesting for a few minutes, the Trinamool MPs staged a walkout.
Minister of state for home affairs Kiren Rijiju, however, denied the presence of the "red diary".
"These are political allegations. There is no truth in it. No such diary was recovered," Rijiju told reporters in Delhi.
Later, BJP member Kirit Somaiya hit back, alleging that the Trinamool government in West Bengal was creating "hurdles" in the CBI investigation into the Saradha chit fund scam, in which names of "one dozen" Trinamool leaders have cropped up.
This led to protests by Trinamool members but Somaiya went on saying that 3.5 lakh small investors had been cheated in the chit fund scheme.
"The state government is not cooperating with the CBI probe," he alleged.
Amid noisy scenes, the Speaker adjourned the House for lunch, ahead of schedule.
In Rajya Sabha, Trinamool's Derek O'Brien sought to raise the issue during Zero Hour and Question Hour but was disallowed.
He had earlier given a notice for suspension of Question Hour but was not allowed.
As O'Brien rose to raise the issue during Question Hour, BJP members shouted him down by raising the issue of Saradha chit fund scam.
The members flashed symbolic red diaries with Sahara written on them, and tried to storm the well of the upper house as well to press their demand.
Trinamool members later staged a walkout as they were disallowed from raising the issue.
Counter-rally in Kolkata
Mamata Banerjee's nephew and Diamond Harbour Lok Sabha MP, Abhisekh Banerjee, said the West Bengal chief minister does not want to respond to Shah as she believes "he is not of her stature".
Mamata cancelled an appearance at the rally held by Abhishek to counter Shah's allegations levelled against her by Shah.
Speaking almost from the same spot where Shah delivered his Sunday speech, Abhisekh attacked the BJP and PM Modi saying he has done nothing for West Bengal after coming to power.
Abhisekh mocked Modi by comparing him with his aunt saying while he flies in private jets, goes abroad and changes wardrobe frequently, Mamata stays in a small house, wears handloom sarees and chappals.
Without naming Shah, he said those who come to Bengal like migratory birds, address a rally and return to Delhi will not win elections in the state.
Abhisekh also alleged Union minister of law and justice Sadanand Gowda's assets jumped from Rs. 9 crore to Rs. 20 crore in three months, and BJP must explain it.
Shah on Sunday had sounded the poll bugle to oust Trinamool from the state in the 2015 Kolkata Municipal Corporation and 2016 assembly elections and called for a Trinamool-free Bengal.
The BJP's rise in Bengal has sparked speculations about new equations in the state's political arena where the saffron brigade was only a fringe player until recently.
However, banking on Modi's poll promises on development, the party bagged an impressive 16.8% vote share in the April-May Lok Sabha elections. Even though the BJP won just two of the 42 seats, it made an impact.
Frequent clashes between BJP and Trinamool supporters have been reported in West Bengal since the polls.
The BJP chief's address came at a time when the ruling Trinamool is reeling under graft allegations in the multi-crore Saradha chit fund scam and the Burdwan blasts on October 2 that killed two alleged militants from Bangladesh.
Addressing the rally that saw a crowd of two lakh people, Shah had attacked Banerjee over the Saradha case, terrorist activities as well as lack of development in the state.
The TMC on Sunday had refused to attach much importance to Shah's rally and described it as a 'grand flop show'.
The city police, West Bengal fire department and the Kolkata Municipal Corporation had denied permission for the event at the Victoria House, where the ruling Trinamool usually organises its annual martyrs' day rally.
An intervention by the Calcutta high court saw the BJP getting the nod only at the eleventh hour.

Haryana sisters who thrashed molesters to be felicitated by CMHaryana sisters who beat up molesters to be felicitated by CM
PTI  Rohtak, Haryana, November 30, 2014
First Published: 18:41 IST(30/11/2014) | Last Updated: 13:58 IST(1/12/2014)
Comments
The brave college-going sisters, who fought back eve-teasers in a Haryana Roadways bus, will be honoured by Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Republic day.
In a rare show of courage, the two sisters thrashed three molestors inside a bus in Haryana's Rohtak town, even as passengers chose to look the other way.
Both sisters confronted the accused and mustered enough courage to thrash them, with one of the girls even hitting the youths with her belt, for allegedly outraging their modesty.
The entire incident, recorded by a passenger on mobile phone, went viral both on television and social media. It showed the two girls using their hands and a belt to thrash the molestors, who appeared to be taken by surprise.
A case has been registered against three youths in this connection, police said on Sunday. No arrest has, however, been made so far.
The accused have been identified as Kuldeep, Mohit and Deepak, police said, adding that a case under section 354 (assault or criminal force with intent to outrage woman's modesty) and section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of IPC have been registered against them.
The victims in their complaint alleged that they were harassed by some youths in a Haryana Roadways bus when they were going to their college on Friday.
When the victims objected, one of the accused started beating them up.
Not to give up easily, the girls fought with the accused as fellow passengers remained mute spectators. One of the victims even hit the accused with a belt, police said.
One of the girls said, "They threatened us and abused us. One of them touched my sister inappropriately. They started making obscene gestures... After heated exchanges, one of the boys called his friends asking him to beat us up. One of them beat my sister while two others caught hold of me.
"Then, I whipped out my belt and thrashed them. They pushed us out of the bus when it slowed down," she narrated.
Meanwhile, the father of the two sisters alleged that there was pressure from the panchayat that the girls should withdraw the complaint.
SP Rohtak Shanshank Anand told PTI over phone, "We have identified the accused and soon they will be arrested. These are brave girls and we fully support them."

Nifty Retreats From Record High, Hovers Near 8,600
NDTV | Updated On: December 01, 2014 13:24 (IST)
Oil Slumps Near $59 for First Time Since 2009 on Oversupply
NSE Nifty retreated from record highs today on some selling pressure in metal, oil & gas and capital goods stocks. The Nifty rose nearly 35 points to hit a record high of 8,623 today in early trade as oil prices tumbled to a five-year low. Some caution also set in ahead of RBI policy review scheduled for tomorrow, traders said.
Oil-users were among the top gainers today. Jet Airways surged nearly 6 per cent, while Asian Paints traded 5 per cent higher. Apollo Tyres rose nearly 3 per cent and state-run oil marketing company Hindustan Petroleum Corp jumped over 2 per cent. The fall in crude oil will boost operating margins for users and increase discretionary spends in the economy, analysts say.
"We believe there is still room for the downstream crude players or those that use crude as a raw material to move north, be it paints, tyres, OMCs or lubricant companies," said Jyotheesh Kumar, executive vice-president of HDFC Securities.
Markets also got a boost after the government scrapped a rule mandating traders to export 20 per cent of all gold imported into the country.
Friday's move to ease gold imports sent jewellery stocks sharply higher today. Titan, India's biggest gold company surged over 6.5 per cent, while Rajesh Exports traded with over 3 per cent gains.
Banking shares also traded higher ahead of crucial Reserve Bank policy announcement tomorrow. Traders have pinned their hopes on a rate cut, but most economists say the central bank will hold rates. Lenders such as Axis Bank and PNB rose over 1 per cent.
Shares in Maruti Suzuki and TVS Motor jumped on Monday after the automakers reported better-than-estimated sales numbers for the month of November.
Maruti Suzuki gained over 2 per cent to a day high of Rs 3,414.75, while shares in TVS Motor surged over 4 per cent to a day high of Rs 239.50.
India has been the best-performing emerging market this year on the back of record buying by foreign investors. On Friday, FIIs bought shares worth Rs 936 crore. They have invested over $40 billion in debt and equities this calendar year.
The rupee was trading at 62.15 vs Friday's close of 62.02. The Indian currency hit a low of 62.25 earlier, a level last seen on February 20.
Among top Nifty losers, Sesa Sterlite, Jindal Steel and Power, NMDC, BHEL and ONGC were down over 2 per cent.
At 1:17 pm, the Sensex was down 8 points to 28,686 while Nifty was almost unchanged at 8,589.

New Delhi: The war of words continue between the Trinamool Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party as both the parties are not missing a chance to target the other. The stand off between the two parties once again played out in Parliament on Monday as TMC MPs held protest outside the House demanding a Central Bureau of Investigation probe in the alleged links of BJP President Amit Shah with the Sahara group.
TMC MPs stormed the well of the House in Rajya Sabha and shouted slogans in Lok Sabha as well. They demanded a clarification from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and suspension of the question hour in the Upper House.
TMC leader Derek O'Brien flashed a red diary in Rajya Sabha saying "it was recovered during raids in Sahara premises that has names of NM and Amit Shah".
#winter session #parliament #tmc #bjp
TMC MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay said, "There was a diary found during the Sahara probe in which BJP President Amit Shah's name appears. We have asked for the question hour to be suspended. We want the Prime Minister to give an explanation on this."
The government was quick to hit back and said that the TMC was making allegations for political gains. "There is no truth in such allegations. No such diary was recovered. The TMC is making allegations for political gains," Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju said.
Another BJP MP Chandan Mitra said, "The TMC is disturbed by the successful rally that was held by Amit Shah in Bengal yesterday. This diary has no basis at all."
The TMC's renewed attack on the government was the fallout of BJP President Amit Shah's rally in Kolkata on Sunday, where he accused TMC chief and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee of using the money from the Saradha scam to fund the terrorists responsible for the Burdwan blast.
Mamata Banerjee will also hold a rally in Kolkata on Monday to counter Amit Shah.

Will try to bring GST Bill in this Session of Parliament: Jaitley6
0
New Delhi: The National Democratic Alliance government plans to get some key bills passed in the ongoing Winter Session of Parliament. After a productive week, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Monday said that he will try to introduce the Goods & Service Tax (GST) Bill in Parliament.
The government proposes to implement the GST from April 1, 2016, and the new Finance Commission may be set up ahead of its schedule to look into the issues related with the new indirect tax regime.
The UPA government in 2011 introduced a Constitution Amendment Bill in the Lok Sabha to pave the way for the introduction of GST.

#arun jaitley #parliament #winter session #gst bill
The states have sought a 5-year compensation mechanism from the Centre and demanded that it be included in the Bill.
Lack of consensus on compensation to states on revenue loss has delayed implementation of GST. The GST aims at subsuming most of the indirect taxes at the central as well as state level.
As part of the roll out of GST, the CST is being phased out and has been reduced to two per cent from four per cent. The Centre collects CST and distributes it among states.
The government had earlier said the Finance Commission can be involved in the exercise of compensating states for revenue losses following implementation of the GST.

Watch: The worlds largest Christmas lights displayAn Australian lawyer has set a world record by stringing up almost 1.2 million Christmas lights in a shopping center in Canberra. Guinness World Records confirmed Friday that it was the largest ever display made up of LED lights. (AP)
Australia is definitely beaming with holiday spirit.
The country's capital, Canberra, has a tradition of stringing Christmas lights at a shopping center, but this year, the city managed to set a world record with a display of about 1.2 million LED lights, beating out Uzbekistan's 2012 record by almost 200,000 bulbs.

The display's wiring is  over 75 miles  long and shows three giant Christmas presents tied together.
The point of this extravagant display? David Richards, a lawyer from the city who was the mastermind behind the project and had architects and engineers help him achieve this feat, stated that the proceeds would go to a local charity.
Richards, who also set a record last year for "the most Christmas lights on a residential property," told Guinness that "Christmas lights really get people into the festive spirit... We decorated our home for years, and people came from everywhere to see our lights. This year, who knows how many people will come along?"

United Spirits fails to get shareholder nod for series of proposalsSpiceJet shares continue to plunge; down 17 pct
The minority shareholders of United Spirits Ltd (USL) have yet again defeated a series of resolutions that had been approved by the company’s board in the past, several of them concerning agreements between the liquor company and entities linked to Vijay Mallya’s UB Group. As many as nine out of 12 proposals that had been placed before shareholders as special resolutions at an extraordinary general meeting on Friday have not been approved with the requisite majority.
The key resolutions that were defeated in the vote include a R1,337.42-crore loan agreement with Mallya’s holding company United Breweries Holdings Ltd (UBHL), a R33.14-crore property purchase agreement with UBHL, advertising agreements with Mallya’s Formula One team, sponsorship agreements with the football team Mohun Bagan and racing team United Racing & Bloodstock Breeders.
The loan agreement pertains to various pre-existing loans, advances and deposits prior to Diageo’s acquisition of the liquor company which have been consolidated into an unsecured loan. The promoter group had recused from voting on all the resolutions since they were related party transactions.
A day earlier, USL said its special resolution for an exclusive manufacturing and licensing tie-up with parent Diageo failed to get the requisite majority in a postal ballot.

Freida Pinto would love to work with a female Indian directorBy: Press Trust of India | New Delhi |
Posted: November 30, 2014 4:52 pm
Freida Pinto always wanted to be a global citizen and after making a place for herself in Hollywood, the Indian actress is keen to star in a Bollywood movie.
The actress, who shot to international fame with her role in Danny Boyle-directed Oscar-winning saga ‘Slumdog Millionaire’, says there have been opportunities in the past but things somehow did not work out. She is also keen to collaborate with a female director in Bollywood.
“I want to work in Bollywood. I never said that I am not interested in working in Indian film industry.
I would love to work with a female Indian director. There were times when I liked the scripts but as I had already committed to other films in Hollywood, I could not do. At other times the roles were not exciting or strong enough for me to take up,” Freida told PTI in an interview here.
The actress, 30, says Hollywood was always on her mind and feels proud of herself that she overcame all limitations and realised her dream of working outside India.
“I always wanted to be a global citizen. I knew I had to pack my bags go out and establish myself at the global platform. That was my dream. I could do that because I had the right education. I have transcended all the possible limitations. I hope my story can inspire other girls,” she said.
Freida, born and brought up in Mumbai, says she is grateful to her roots for keeping her strong in the foreign land.
“India has taught me a lot; it is something about this country, be the people or the hardships we face but it teaches you great lessons. I don’t get shocked when I see poverty in any country because I have seen it in my own country. India has made me value relationships.”
Freida says she is always conscious about presenting herself as a universal actress as she does not want be stereotyped on the basis of her origin.
“When I go to a filmmaker in Hollywood I don’t present myself as someone who has come from some other country but I go there as an actress. When I choose a role, I look at it from the perspective of content rather than the fact that I am Indian and I should do specific kind of roles. When it comes to work, I just think like an actor,” Frieda added.
The ‘You Will Meet A Tall Dark Stranger’ star feels Hollywood is more open today to various ethnicities.
“Stereotyping of Indian actors has reduced a lot there. It is much easier now but had I entered 10 years back it would have been difficult getting good work there,” she said.

Nothing classy about Elizabeth Lautens criticism of the Obama girlsPresident Barack Obama speaks as his daughters Sasha and Malia look on before pardoning “Cheese” and his alternate “Mac,” both 20-week old, 48-pound turkeys, during a ceremony at the White House on Nov. 26. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images)
Raising teenagers is hard.
I know from experience — and I haven’t had to do it under the watchful eye of the White House press corps. Or the hyper-critical eye of  Elizabeth Lauten , communications director for Rep. Stephen Fincher, a Republican from Tennessee. (Update: Lauten resigned on  Monday.)
If you haven’t heard yet — and to be honest, my attention was focused on a Thanksgiving turkey that didn’t get pardoned — Lauten blasted President Obama’s daughters, Sasha, 13, and Malia, 16, for their facial expressions, body language and outfits during the annual Thanksgiving turkey pardoning ceremony.
Then she made things worse with what sounded like a half-hearted attempt at an apology that tried to show what a good person Lauten must be since she realized “how hurtful” her words were “after many hours of prayer.”
If Lauten were a mom, particularly of teen girls, she’d have a lot more empathy, I suspect, and she’d probably agree with me that kids in the White House should be off-limits to media scrutiny. If you don’t like the president, fine. Criticize his policies, his actions, his decisions.
But don’t pick on his kids or say he’s a bad dad because his girls rolled their eyes at his jokes.
I still remember Rush Limbaugh calling Chelsea Clinton a dog on his television show. She was just 13 years old — that often-awkward age for young girls — and it’s a wonder he didn’t scar her for life with his attempts to poke fun at her. He also referred to Amy Carter as possibly “the most unattractive presidential daughter in the history of this country.”
Such comments aren’t funny. They’re just cruel.
So when I read Lauten’s comment, I found a video of the event in question, wondering what kind of disrespectful faces the girls made. Yes, they looked bored, there was a little eye-rolling (those jokes might’ve deserved it) and when Malia was asked by her dad if she wanted to pet the now-pardoned turkey, she said, “Nah.” I thought she was restrained, and she did get a big laugh from the audience.
At the 67th anniversary of the National Thanksgiving Turkey presentation on Wednesday, President Obama pardoned two Ohio turkeys that will now live at the home of a former Virginia governor. (AP)
As for their wardrobe choices earning them “a spot at a bar” — a really inappropriate analogy for underage girls — I have to defend the girls. Has Lauten seen any teenaged girls lately at her local mall?
To be honest, I don’t remember the last time I was in a bar, but I did attend the National Honor Society induction ceremony at my son’s high school last month here in Kansas. The boys wore suits, the girls wore black dresses. Some pretty short dresses. With some pretty high heels.
Short skirts are in style. And when you’re a teenaged girl, there is perhaps nothing worse on this earth than to wear something that isn’t in style.
Neither of the Obama daughters showed cleavage at the turkey pardoning. They both wore long sleeves. Yes, their skirts were short. Malia wore dark tights with hers. My son’s high school would not have sent either one home for indecent clothing.
After the firestorm of criticism erupted against Lauten, she posted an apology, but she never used the words, “I’m sorry,” and she didn’t direct her comments directly to Malia and Sasha, as she should have. How about, “I don’t agree with your father’s policies, but I’m sorry for attacking the two of you”?
Instead, she described how she prayed for hours. Did she not recall what many say is the basic message of Jesus Christ? “Love one another.”
“Love one another.” That doesn’t mean posting hateful messages against young girls on Facebook . It means showing respect, even when you disagree with others. It means practicing kindness. It means being nice and remembering that we are all human.
That message was expanded in Sunday’s sermon by Adam Hamilton, the senior pastor at the United Methodist Church of the Resurrection in Leawood, Kan. when he said, “Jesus called us to love our neighbors and to love our enemies.”
Lauten’s original post linked to an article  from a conservative site that concluded, “I don’t think you would have ever seen the Bush daughters in dresses that short. Class is completely absent from this White House.” It seems like Lauten, whose job is to put the spin on the message, should have known better than to pick up this gauntlet of hate and run with it.
Expressing such disdain for young girls hardly seems like the way for Republicans to woo women, minorities and youth.
Or the way for one Republican woman to stay employed. There’s already a Facebook page and an online petition calling for Lauten to resign — or for Fincher to fire her.
As for Sasha and Malia — I hope someone shows them this video of Chelsea Clinton, who said, “I’m a believer in a thick skin as a survival tactic….I have the indubious honor of being compared to a dog as a 13-year-old by Rush Limbaugh. That was not about me, that was about him.”

JSW Steel defers Italian steel firm Lucchini s buyJSW Steel defers Italian steel firm Lucchini's buy
PTI     Kolkata   Last Updated: December 1, 2014  | 12:00 IST
JSW Steel Ltd, the third-largest Indian steel maker has said it has deferred the proposed acquisition of Italy's Lucchini SpV.
"For the time being, plans for India is much stronger and larger. We want to focus in India.... We have deferred our decision to invest in the Italian project," JSW Steel chairman and managing director Sajjan Jindal said.
He was speaking on the sidelines of inauguration of Ispat Pragati Bhawan, the new office of Institute of Steel Development & Growth (Insdag) in the city.
In September, Jindal had told reporters that JSW has offered less than $100 million for three mills of the insolvent Lucchini and it was in a position to win it.
The company recently also gave a clarification in the bourses saying, "In line with our long term strategy to acquire finishing mills near to the market, we have submitted a binding bid for takeover of Rolling Mills of the Piombini Plant of Lucchini in Italy subject to certain terms and conditions. We are yet to get the response on this bid."
Lucchini, with a steel capacity of about 2.5 mt, was owned by Russia's Severstal but had to be declared insolvent in 2012 following which the government placed it under special administration and started the process to find buyers.
JSW currently has a total installed steel making capacity of 14.3 million tonnes in India.

“A huge heartfelt thank you! Just realised I have touched 5 million followers! Thank you for listening…. lots of love… always,” Johar posted.

Barcelona edge out Valencia 1-0  closes gap on topBy: Reuters | Madrid |
Posted: December 1, 2014 9:42 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 1:42 pm
Barcelona left it late to snatch a 1-0 win at Valencia on Sunday after Atletico Madrid’s 2-0 victory at home to Deportivo La Coruna was overshadowed by the death of a visiting fan hours before kickoff.
A 43-year-old Deportivo supporter had to be pulled out of the freezing Manzanares river near Atletico’s Calderon arena after dozens of rival fans, who police said belonged to radical “ultras” groups, battled in the streets.
The man, who was identified by Deportivo as Francisco Javier Romero Taboada, suffered cardiac arrest, hypothermia and head injuries and died shortly after 2 pm local time (1300 GMT) when he failed to respond to efforts to revive him in hospital.
“It’s disgusting, such scum have no place in football,” Atletico chief executive Miguel Angel Gil Marin said on the club’s website (www.clubatleticodemadrid.com).
“I just hope that they identify those responsible so they can’t repeat actions as regrettable as these,” he added, just one voice in widespread condemnation of the violence.
Barca and Valencia each had plenty of chances in a scrappy game at the Mestalla that was settled when Sergio Busquets pounced on a loose ball and smashed it high into the net in the fourth minute of added time.
The ugly side of La Liga was again on display when Lionel Messi, who had a quiet night after setting a La Liga scoring record last weekend, appeared to be struck on the head by a plastic bottle thrown from the crowd during the goal celebrations.
The Argentina captain did not look to have been hurt and gave the thumbs up as he left the pitch.
Barca’s victory trimmed the gap to Real Madrid back to two points after the leaders set a club record of 16 straight victories in all competitions when they won 2-1 at Malaga on Saturday.
Real have 33 points from 13 matches, with Barca on 31 and champions Atletico on 29 in third. Valencia dropped to fifth on 24 points, two behind Sevilla who thrashed visiting Andalusian rivals Granada 5-1.
Barca should have been ahead in the 14th minute when Valencia goalkeeper Diego Alves produced a superb save to deny Luis Suarez, who is yet to open his account in La Liga since his ban for biting expired at the end of October.
The Uruguay international, who joined from Liverpool in the close season, then had a goal wrongly ruled out for offside in the 69th minute.
Barca keeper Claudio Bravo was also on fine form and conjured brilliant stops against second-half efforts from Sofiane Feghouli and Alvaro Negredo.
“We are never satisfied with a draw and we pushed until the end,” Busquets said in an interview with Spanish television.
“The ball fell to me after Alves saved and I put everything into the shot,” added the Spain midfielder.

Samsung to launch Tizen smartphone in India‘Samsung to launch Tizen smartphone in India’
Reuters

SEOUL, Dec 1:  
South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd plans to launch a new sub-$100 smartphone running on its own Tizen operating system in India later this month, South Korea's Maeil Business Newspaper said on Monday.
The paper, a local business daily, said Samsung will hold a press conference on December 10 to launch its first Tizen smartphone, to be called the Z1. A Samsung Electronics spokeswoman declined to comment.
Samsung had initially planned to launch a Tizen smartphone in Russia in the third quarter but scrapped the plan. The firm said at the time that it wanted to further enhance the ecosystem behind Tizen. Only a handful of devices, including the firm's smartwatch products, currently run on the platform.
The majority of Samsung's mobile devices are based on Google's Android platform. The South Korean firm's push to develop its own operating system is part of efforts to reduce dependence on the US firm, but delays in product launches have undercut expectations.

New Delhi, Dec 1:  
Crude oil futures tumbled 4.28 per cent to trade at Rs 4,030 per barrel as speculators indulged in reducing exposures after it fell to new multi-year lows in Asian trade.
At the Multi Commodity Exchange, crude oil for delivery in December fell sharply by Rs 180, or 4.28 per cent, to Rs 4,030 per barrel in 3,183 lots.
Oil for January next delivery plunged by Rs 176, or 4.15 per cent, to Rs 4,068 per barrel in a turnover of 229 lots.
Sentiment remained weak at futures trade as crude oil prices fell further in Asian trade to new multi-year lows, sparked by OPEC’s decision to maintain crude output in an oversupplied market, analysts said.
The unabated price plunge comes after the 12-nation Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) opted Thursday to maintain its collective output ceiling at 30 million barrels per day, where it has stood for three years.
Meanwhile, West Texas Intermediate crude for January delivery dipped USD 1.55 to USD 64.60, its lowest intra-day level of since July 2009. Also, brent crude for January sank USD 1.84 to USD 68.31 a barrel, below the psychologically importer USD 70 level on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Easier finding god than a home in pricey MumbaiEasier finding God than a home in pricey Mumbai
Arlene Chang ,  Indiaspend.org | Mumbai | December 01, 2014 15:36 IST
The prices shocked me, in a nice way. It was unbelievable that anything was available in an area where the average prices in a multi-storeyed building for the July-September period stood at Rs. 43,845 per sq ft.
 
 
I've often heard house hunters say that finding God is easier than finding a house in Mumbai.
 
That epigram recently sprung to life when I decided it was time to buy my own apartment in Bombay. I had, after all, been working for eight years, was drawing what many would term a decent salary and I thought it was high-time I stopped being the "shameless Indian daughter" (as I liked to call myself) at 33.
 
Often, in my reverie, I would fancy owning an apartment in the Queen of the Western suburbs, Bandra. And although I wasn't sure I'd be able to afford anything in the area, I was willing to give it a shot.
 
My apartment hunt landed me on a housing website, where I typed my criteria -- Area: Bandra; Price: Up to Rs 1.5 crore; Bedrooms: 1RK (a studio or what is popularly known as a one room kitchen in Indian parlance), 1BHK (a one bedroom, hall or living room and kitchen). The search threw up some 50-odd apartments. Except two, all the apartments were above Rs. 50 lakh. The two exceptions were studio apartments (or 1RK), whose prices were quoted as Rs. 23 lakh and Rs. 27 lakh.
 
The prices shocked me, in a nice way. It was unbelievable that anything was available in an area where the average prices in a multi-storeyed building for the July-September period stood at Rs. 43,845 per sq ft. I obviously decided to take a look at both properties. I remember thinking to myself that the case for affordable housing wasn't completely lost in one of the world's most expensive cities.
 
Knight Frank Prime International Residential Index
Too good to be true
 
I first visited the Rs 23-lakh apartment. It was on the top floor of a building with a narrow, steep flight of stairs. The building was clearly an add-on to the main house, which was on the ground floor. The owner of the apartment asked me how I would pay for the flat, and when I said I would take a bank loan, I was told that I needed to "find another mode of payment" (read, cash). The reason: the flat was purchased on a personal loan from a relative, which I'm presuming was a cash loan (of unaccounted for money or black money) which he intended to pay back in the same form. If I purchased the house with a bank loan, my payment would be money that is accounted for with tax authorities, in turn requiring him to account for it when he filed his taxes.
 
Good sense dictated that I let go of the apartment. I neither had the ready money nor the temerity to purchase a flat that seemed like it was a shady undertaking.
 
I moved on to the next flat, its price quoted as Rs. 27 lakh. This flat was a dream: 230-sq-feet built-up (built-up area is the area enclosed within the apartment -- also known as carpet area, the area that the thickness of the walls cover and the balcony area, if any), in a prime location, cheery ambience, big windows and plenty of light. The building seemed legit (with around 15 families), and the owner of the apartment and her two children were only too helpful.
 
They presented me with the purchase agreement for the flat, maintenance bill receipts from the society and electricity bills. I asked them if the land was freehold and if the building had a registered society -- yes, they said. I spoke to the secretary of the building and asked him the same questions. He confirmed what the owner had told me. I also asked the owner if the apartment fell under gaothan land --  i.e. a village site located within a town or city -- and I was told it did not. In fact, the owner said, the building would be redeveloped.
 
Since the owner of the apartment and the secretary of the building were generally cooperative, I had no reason to disbelieve either, and when I was asked for a token amount, I willingly complied with the timelines and the amounts asked. The owner intended to use the deposit money I paid her for the flat to buy another home.
 
I soon realised that when something seems too good to be true, it must be just that.
 
The issues with the apartment surfaced when I approached the bank for a housing loan. The building was built on an plot that originally had a bungalow. The bank wanted the bungalow's 'Certificate of Occupancy', a document issued by the municipality (the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation), certifying the building was compliant with applicable codes and laws, effectively stating it is suitable for habitation. On calling the building's secretary about it, he told me he didn't have it. When I asked him to source it from the builders, he said the builders didn't have it either. I then asked him for a 'Building Completion Certificate', issued by the municipality after the completion of work on a building. The secretary didn't have that either.
 
I found it dubious that a supposedly legal building didn't have any of the permissions and certificates it should have had. I prodded further and asked the secretary of the building for a copy of the registration of the society. Not surprisingly, he didn't have it. A copy of the application for registration of the society? No.
 
And it gets worse
These developments alarmed me. By now, I had already paid the owner a deposit of Rs. 5 lakh, and I was unwilling to put any more money into a potentially illegal apartment.
 
I had consulted with a lawyer about the property before I went to seek a bank loan and since he didn't raise any concerns, I believed the property to be a safe buy. However, the evident non-compliance made me seek a second opinion. I decided to show the property papers to another civil lawyer.
 
It was lawyer No. 2 who discovered that in addition to the non-compliances I had discovered, three of the previous owners of the flat, had not paid stamp duty or registration fees -- which effectively made its ownership illegal.

Gold futures tumble 1.9% on weak global  domestic cuesGold futures tumble 1.9% on weak global, domestic cues

New Delhi, Dec 1:  
Tracking weak global and domestic cues, gold prices slumped 1.93 per cent to Rs 25,668 per 10 grams at the futures trade today as speculators indulged in trimming positions.
At the Multi Commodity Exchange, gold for delivery in far-month February plunged by Rs 504 or 1.93 per cent to Rs 25,668 per 10 grams in a business turnover of 381 lots.
Likewise, the metal for delivery in December was trading at Rs 25,301 per ten gram, down by Rs 493, or 1.91 per cent in 102 lots.
Analysts said a weak trend in the overseas markets after Swiss voters rejected a plan for their central bank to accumulate bullion and the Reserve Bank of India on Friday eased curbs on import of the precious metal put pressure on gold prices at the futures trade here.
Easing restrictions on gold imports, the Reserve Bank had on Friday scrapped the 80:20 scheme.
Under the 80:20 norm, put in place in August 2013 to curb high gold inflows that was widening the current account deficit, at least 20 per cent of the imported gold had to be mandatorily exported before bringing in new lots.
Globally, gold fell 2.1 per cent to $1,142.88 an ounce in Singapore today, the lowest level since November 7.

Asian shares hit six-week lows on Swiss referendumAsian shares hit six-week lows on Swiss referendum
Reuters
Tweet
Tokyo, Dec 1:  
Gold prices tumbled on Monday after Swiss voters overwhelmingly rejected the proposals to boost gold reserves in a referendum, joining a broad rout in commodities that sent copper and oil prices to four- and five-year lows.
The slide in the oil and commodity prices is hurting many assets tied to the resource sector - from Australian mining shares to the Malaysian ringgit.
MSCI's broadest index
MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.9 per cent, hitting six-week lows.
US stock futures also slipped 0.4 per cent, though some market players think the fall could stem partly from disappointing sales at the start of the US holiday shopping season last Friday.
European stocks
European stocks are expected to fall, with Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC 40 seen shedding 0.6 per cent.
Gold fell more than two per cent at one point to $1,142.90 per ounce, its lowest level in more than three weeks, while silver was also hit, falling more than six per cent to a five-year low below $14.50 per ounce.
Swiss gold reserves plan
The Swiss gold reserves proposal, had it been approved, would have compelled the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to more than double its gold reserves and banned it from ever selling the metal, threatening its ability to defend a €1.20 cap on the Swiss franc imposed at the height of the euro zone crisis.
The Swiss franc dipped to 1.2042 on the euro from 1.2018 at the end of last week, though the Swiss currency is supported by investors who still regard it as one of the safest currencies in the world. It last stood at 1.2040.
“The result should of course temporarily relieve the pressure on the SNB’s currency floor, albeit whilst doing little or nothing in our opinion to reverse the fundamental downward trajectory of EUR/CHF,’’ said JPMorgan analyst Paul Meggyesi.
Crude oil
Oil prices hit five-year lows, unable to find a bottom despite their biggest fall in 2 1/2 years last week after OPEC held back from cutting output in the face of a supply glut.
US crude briefly fell more than three percent to a five-year low of $64.10 per barrel, with the fall from June exceeding 40 per cent. It last stood at $64.56, down 2.4 percent.
Adding fuel to the fire, Saudi Arabia's oil minister told fellow OPEC members last week that they must combat the US shale oil boom.
“They (OPEC) can get by at $60 a barrel, but that price would knock out a fair whack of the competition — much of US shale oil for example — as well as put investment in future capacity growth firmly on the back-burner,’’ ANZ analysts said in a note. “They're playing the long game, banking that others can’t.’’
Copper prices
Copper also fell to as low as $6,230.75, piercing through its March low to hit its lowest levels since mid-2010. It last stood at $6,245.50, down 1.7 per cent.
The Australian dollar fell more than one per cent to a four-year low of $0.8417 as did the Malaysian ringgit, which fell to 3.437 to the dollar.
China’s manufacturing PMI
Adding salt to commodities’ wounds, Chinese official manufacturing data suggested growth is slowing in China, demand from which has supported commodity prices for years.
Sliding oil and raw material prices have stirred deflation fears in the euro zone and Japan, cementing expectations that the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan will take more steps to support their respective economies.
The dollar, taking advantage of such concerns, attracted bids against the euro and yen.
Deflation fears
The euro was slightly weaker at $1.2449 after having fallen on Friday on news that annual inflation in the euro zone cooled to a five-year low of 0.3 per cent in November.
Many traders expect the ECB may signal further action later this week to ward off deflation.
Dollar vs yen
The dollar also hit a seven-year high of 119.03 yen and the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, rose to 88.451, a four-year high.
“Given that the Fed is going to raise rates next year, the monetary policy divergence should support the dollar,’’ said Osao Iizuka, the head of FX trading at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank.
The yen’s fall and lower commodity prices helped Japanese shares, with the Nikkei posting 0.8 per cent gains to close at seven-year high.

US October oil shale permits drop: is the slowdown hereVideo: Oil price drop takes toll on shale
New York, Dec 1:  
US oil producers have been racing full-speed ahead to drill new shale wells in recent years, even in the face of lower oil prices. But new data suggests that the much-anticipated slowdown in shale country may have finally arrived.
Permits for new wells dropped 15 per cent across 12 major shale formations last month, according to exclusive information provided to Reuters by DrillingInfo, an industry data firm, offering the first sign of a slowdown in a drilling frenzy that has seen permits double since last November.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries last week agreed to maintain its production quota of 30 million-barrels-per-day, despite a 30 per cent drop in oil prices since June, triggering an additional 10 per cent decline. That move, many analysts believe, was squarely aimed at US oil producers driving the country's energy resurgence: can they continue drilling at the current pace if prices don't rise?
"Currently, the market is focused on US shale as the place where spending and production must be curtailed," Roger Read, a Wells Fargo analyst, said in a note Friday. "There is little doubt, in our view, that lower oil and gas prices will result in lower spending and lower shale production in 2015 to 2017."
Playing into Saudi's hands
A cutback of US production could play into the hands of Saudi Arabia, which has suggested over the past few months that it is comfortable with much lower oil prices.
Most analysts predict US oil producers can maintain their healthy production rates in the first half of 2015 - thanks in part to investments made months ago.
Some oil service companies have suggested that a slowdown might be held off, as they continue to buy key drilling components. But, the data suggests that production is likely to eventually succumb to lower prices.
"The first domino is the price, which causes other dominos to fall," said Karr Ingham, an economist who compiles the Texas PetroIndex, an annual analysis of the state's energy economy. One of the first tiles to drop: the number of permits issued, Ingham said.
Texas issued a record number of permits, 934, before dropping to 885 in October. The 885 is still more than double levels seen in the same month in 2010 when the shale revolution was just starting, but it shows a cooling off that hasn't been seen to the same degree in the past two years.
A drop in the rig count is expected two to four months after a decline in permits - and production growth would likely start to slow six months later.
"This is a pull back from the acceleration. People are being careful," said Allen Gilmer, chief executive officer of DrillingInfo. While permits have declined at other times, Gilmer says there is currently an early indication of a slowdown in the rig count.
DrillingInfo said for 10 shale formations, a permitting slowdown was noted in October. For one formation, data was not available, and for two, the Barnett shale in Texas and the Bakken in North Dakota, permits rose slightly.
The permitting slowdown was particularly pronounced in two Texas formations, the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford shale, which saw new permits decline by 13 and 22 per cent respectively.
Texas economy
This year, shale has bolstered the Texas economy, with oil production in Texas up 23 per cent in August from a year earlier, according to the Texas Petro Index, released last month.
Oil and gas jobs are at an all-time high in the state, said Ed Longanecker, president of Texas Independent Producers & Royalty Owners Association - some 414,000 according to TIPRO, a figure that has risen for each of the past five years. Economic disruptions are expected as the price decline trickles down.
"As oil prices fall, there is going to be a response, and it will ultimately turn up in the numbers," said Ingham.

With strong govt at Centre  India s software market revivesWith strong govt at Centre, India's software market revives
BS Reporter | New Delhi Dec 01, 2014 12:45 PM IST
India’s domestic software market showed signs of revival in the first six months of 2014, growing 10.7% over a year ago. 
 
According to a research by market consultancy firm International Data Corporation (IDC), growth came on the back of a few major deals won by big companies. These deals were in the pipeline since early 2013 but did not materialise earlier because of economic and political uncertainties. 
 
“With the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) forming the government at the Centre after a sweeping win in the general elections, there was some positivity in the market that reflected in the information technology (IT) investments by major verticals like BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance), manufacturing, retail and e-commerce,” IDC said in a note on Monday.
 
Microsoft, with a 31.8% share, continued to dominate the market in the first half of the year. It was followed by Oracle and SAP, which controlled 12% and 6.5% of the market, respectively. While IBM’s market share was 5.5% share, a little more than 40% was accounted for by numerous small players.
 
IDC expects the software market to grow at a stable pace in the next five years (up to 2018), with a healthy annual rate of 10.5%. Some of the areas that are expected to see high software uptake are mobile application development & mobile device management, security software (related to third platform), system software, analytics and engineering applications.
 
Some government initiatives, such as Mobile Seva, Digital India and Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, will be instrumental in triggering adoption of software solutions in the coming years. Over the next two to three years, launch of various other projects is also expected to increase penetration of IT-backed sectors like manufacturing, retail, travel & tourism and BFSI.
 
“Customers of large as well as small & medium businesses are looking at ways to curb their capital expenditure. They are keen to embark on the cloud journey. So, the vendors are making their licensing policies more flexible and easier, so that existing customers could smoothly transition to a cloud environment,” said Shweta Baidya, senior market analyst (software) at IDC India.
 
“Some vendors are offering exchange schemes to their customers under which they buy back hardware in exchange for a cloud set-up. These are resonating very well with the small and medium businesses,” Baidya added.

Karan Johar signs Abhishek Varman to direct KalankBy: BollywoodHungama.com | Mumbai |
Posted: December 1, 2014 1:05 pm
Karan Johar seems to be on a movie announcement spree and will be busy constantly switching roles as a director, producer and actor. While he will be making a full-fledged debut as an actor with Anurag Kashyap’s ‘Bombay Velvet’, he will be directing ‘Ae Dil Hai Mushkil’ with Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Ranbir Kapoor and Anushka Sharma in the lead. And now, he has announced yet another film titled ‘Kalank’, which Karan will be producing under his banner Dharma Productions.
‘Kalank’ will be directed by Abhishek Varman, who directed ‘2 States’ for the same banner. In fact, the film in question is said to have an emotional connect with Karan Johar, since his father Yash Johar was the one who conducted research on the subject of this film.
Dealing with human emotions, ‘Kalank’ is a period love story which tries to find its identity amidst the dangerous political situation during Partition. Also, from what we hear, Yash Johar had even visited Lahore for the film and it has been his dream to see the film come to life. However, it is being said that Karan Johar, after the death of his father, could not bring himself to direct it and when Abhishek expressed his wish to do a period drama, the generous producer immediately offered him this plot to develop.
The film is under pre-production currently and the cast is not yet finalized.

US air base lifts lockdown at high school facility in SouthKoreaBy: Agence-France Presse | Seoul |
Posted: December 1, 2014 12:59 pm | Updated: December 1, 2014 1:05 pm
A major US air force base in South Korea went into full lockdown for more than an hour on Monday after what appeared to be a false alarm about a shooter at the facility’s high school.
“The security forces sweeps are now complete. There were no reported injuries or suspicious activity found,” the 51st Fighter Wing stationed at Osan Air Base said in a post on its official Facebook page.
“Everyone is safe. The lockdown has been lifted,” it added.
Osan Air Base, some 65 miles south of Seoul, is one of a number of facilities housing the 28,500 US military personnel permanently based in South Korea.
The facility went into lockdown shortly after 11:00 am (0200 GMT) as a precautionary measure following what high school principal Morgan Nugent suggested was a possible hoax call.
“One of our teachers received a call that sounded automated saying that there was an active shooter drill taking place,” Nugent said.
“There was no scheduled school shooter drill on base, so we have decided to err on the side of safety and went into a full school lockdown,” he added.
The safety measure was extended to the entire base as security forces swept the high school, middle school and elementary school buildings and grounds.

As for Aishwarya, Karan confessed that they both have missed working with each other on several ooccasions in the past. But ‘Ae Dil Hai Mushkil’ fulfilled his dream of working with her.
The movie is speculated to be dealing deeply with relationships, heartbreaks and also how love completes an individual.

reserves increase when there are profits .. if reserves decrease over time it means company has been reporting losses..
now after  20yrs of operation company reserves are only 18cr.. which means over the past 20 yrs company has not even accumulated 1cr of profit a year.. which makes the current rise in profits as one time activity..
---------------
also there is no denying the fact that in past 12 months stock has increased by 19 times.. profits were 6.8cr March 2014.. so are we going to expect 19 times growth in profits.??
long term skm has not even accumulated 20cr in 20yrs of operation..
----------------
as a value investor we need to look at long term company growth.. and the way the promoters have acted by selling 17cr of birds and not even reporting any profits .. is nothing less than an eyewash!!
just chk all the taxes due by skm to all govt agencies it runs up to 6cr .. same as profits reported in March 2014!!..
==========
traders are pumping the stock to dump it on unsuspecting individual investors..
big AVOID!!.. advise to investors..
look at 5 yrs 10yrs profits..
look at 5-10yrs growth in reserves..
look at 5-10yrs dividend payout..
if these are missing then you are taking considerable risk..
right now skmPE is over 40 (march 2014 profits) and .. looking at agove mentioned points (profits, reserves, dividend payout) we can conclude company management has been a failure.. and current good times is just a flash in the pan..
=============
dec qtr results if you look at last 5 yrs you will see has always been lower than sept..
someone my advice to someone who wants to buy SKM..
hold on dont buy....
- see atleast 1 year of consistent profits..
- see dividend payout..
- always compare skm with venkys which is the market leader in poultry..
from chicks to high vlue added products like SPF(Specific pasthogen free eggs) for vaccine manufacturing
- ready to eat products and venkys fast food restaurants..

In muted Q2 show  mid caps make a markMid caps have reported a slowdown in y-o-y topline and bottomline growth. Reuters
Mumbai |
Posted: November 26, 2014 1:20 pm
Though second quarter earnings have largely come in below estimates, mid caps seem to have fared better than their large-cap counterparts.
Just like blue chips, mid caps, too, have reported a slowdown in y-o-y topline and bottomline growth, but their profit margins appear more comfortable than large caps, shows an FE compilation of the September quarter numbers.
An aggregation of Q2 results of 61 large-cap and 83  mid-cap companies — excluding those from the financial and banking domain and oil marketers — shows that while large caps reported a 20-bps expansion in the net profit margin to 10.5% from the last year,  mid caps saw a y-o-y increase of 36 bps.
Mid caps also seem to have weathered the higher interest costs better, given that a 14% y-o-y increase that weakened the pack’s interest coverage ratio by 47 bps points to 2.22% could not impact the net profit margin (4.81%).
Interest coverage is  a gauge of a company’s ability to cater to its outstanding debt.
Click here for graph
At the operating level, both samples reported a similar increase of about 80-90 bps despite mid caps reporting a modest increase in total raw-material costs (1.9% y-o-y).
Large caps, on the other hand,  reported a y-o-y drop of 1.1% in total raw-material expenses, including stock adjustments and finished goods purchases. Operating margins for the samples stood at 14.5% and 20.8%, respectively.
For the analysis, we bifurcated the set of companies as per their market cap; companies with m-cap of more than R25,000 crore were considered large caps and those between R8,000 crore and R25,000 crore were grouped as mid caps.
In the large-cap universe, one in every three companies reported a decline in net profit compared to the same quarter last year, while for mid caps, the number stood at 10% of the sample.
This should explain why at least three brokerage houses — Edelweiss Securities, Motilal Oswal Securities and Kotak Institutional Equities — cut their FY15 earning projections for the Sensex in the last one week. KIE has, in fact, cut its FY15 Sensex EPS growth estimate to 10.7% from 13.8%.
Overall, Q2 numbers have been disappointing across sectors — banks struggling with asset quality issues; consumer goods hit by a slowdown in volume growth; and IT companies reporting lower-than-expected revenue growth.
In the mid-cap space, seven companies reported net losses; While Adani Power and Indian Hotels saw their quarterly losses reduce, JP Associates, Tata Power and MRPL turned loss-making.
The slowdown in the economy was well reflected in a similar quantum (13-14% of the universe) of companies from both packs reporting declines in y-o-y topline growth.
Companies like Bharat Forge, Thermax, Whirlpool, Britannia Industries, Tata Chemicals, JSW Energy, Bharat Electricals and Alstom T&D  were the key good performers among mid caps.

Willing to be flexible on loan recast to aid growth: Raghuram RajanBy: Express News Service |
Posted: November 26, 2014 12:55 am | Updated: November 26, 2014 10:14 am
The Reserve Bank of India is open to giving banks greater flexibility of stressed loans if it helps in the recovery of stalled projects, Governor Raghuram Rajan said on Tuesday.
“This is a risk we are prepared to take if it allows more projects to be set on the track to recovery,” Rajan said while delivering the Dr Verghese Kurien Memorial Lecture at the Institute of Rural Management in Anand, Gujarat.
He did add that the central bank was wary of extending this benefit as bank managements had misused it in the past. “Nevertheless, recognising that it cannot micromanage the resolution of distress, the RBI is exploring ways to allow banks more flexibility in restructuring,” he said.
Rajan, however, made it clear that a little flexibility does not mean that the central bank would tolerate regulatory forbearance. “Regulatory forbearance, which is an euphemism for regulators collaborating with banks to hide problems and push them into the future, is a bad idea.”
“Forbearance is ostrich-like behaviour, hoping the problem will go away. It is not realism but naivete…” Rajan said, adding that the RBI will keep an eye on possible misuse and will be severe in dealing with such cases.
The Governor lashed out at some large borrowers whom he held responsible for deterioration in banks’ credit profile, calling them “freeloaders” who enjoyed “riskless capitalism”.
He expressed concern at how such borrowers have eroded the sanctity of the debt contract. Rajan said that the problem was not because of want of law but because of the way the system was making banks helpless when faced with promoters with deep pockets who can go beyond the debt recovery tribunals to the higher judiciary to fight their cases.
“Faced with this asymmetry of power, banks are tempted to cave in and take the unfair deal the borrower offers,” Rajan said, adding, “how many large promoters have lost their homes or have had to curb their lifestyles despite offering personal guarantees to lenders?”
Total write-offs in the last five years stood at Rs 1.6 lakh crore, he said. “… given the size of stressed assets in the system, there will be more write-offs to come,” he added. With PTI

BSE Sensex  NSE Nifty rebound in volatile trade; realty in limelightBy: Press Trust of India | Bse Sensex |
Posted: November 26, 2014 10:04 am | Updated: November 26, 2014 4:42 pm
The benchmark Sensex today recovered 48 points to 28,386.19 after realty scrips, led by DLF, rose as government approved hiking floor area ratio in Delhi and FMCG shares, including ITC, jumped after yesterday’s slump.
Rate cut hopes and short-covering ahead of tomorrow’s monthly expiry of derivative contracts boosted buying. Positive cues from global markets and lower crude oil price also provided support, traders said.
In line with rise in key indices, the Indian rupee also firmed up to 61.83 (intra-day) against dollar.
In volatile movements, the BSE Sensex resumed lower and then slipped further to hit the day’s low of 28,261.31. Emergence of buying towards the middle of session helped wipe off initial losses to close higher at 28,386.19, logging a rise of 48.14 points, or 0.17 per cent.
The Sensex had lost 161.49 points in yesterday’s trade.
Among the 30-Sensex pack, 17 constituents led by GAIL, Sesa Sterlite, ITC, BHEL, Hindalco and M&M ended higher.
ITC had dropped 5 per cent yesterday after Ministry of Health accepted an expert panel’s recommendation on prohibition on sale of single stick of cigarette and increasing minimum legal age for sale of tobacco products.
Sensex laggards included Bharti Airtel, ICICI Bank, Bajaj Auto, RIL, TCS, L&T, Maruti Suzuki, HDFC Bank and Sun Pharma.
DLF surged 7.2 per cent and Unitech rose 4.4 per cent after Urban Development Ministry approved enhancement of Ground Coverage and Floor Area Ratio in Delhi.
“Led by the Delhi government’s decision to increase the Delhi city’s floor area ratio by 200 per cent, most realty sector stocks saw huge surge in buying activity,” said Rakesh Goyal, Senior Vice President, Bonanza Portfolio.
The 50-issue Nifty of the NSE also saw a mild recovery and closed 12.65, or 0.15 per cent, higher at 8,475.75.
Brokers also said after yesterday’s drop, activity gathered momentum ahead of key macro economic data releases, including September-quarter GDP data later this week.
Meanwhile, provisional data showed that FPIs/FIIs bought shares worth a net Rs 1,168.94 crore yesterday.
Sectorally, BSE Realty index gained the most by surging 4.03 per cent, followed by Power 1.13 per cent, Metal 1.08 per cent and FMCG 1.07 per cent, among others. Smaller shares also saw fresh spell of buying with BSE Smallcap index (1.12 per cent) and Midcap index (0.62 per cent) logging gains.

In terms of sustainable growth, a key driver for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's "Make in India" campaign would be the ability of businesses to have their goods 'sold in India'. A consumer market of global standards will demand quality goods, and inspire entrepreneurs to capitalise on 'buyer-need' driven opportunities, and create wealth. With India's growth story is becoming one of the most anticipated (and much needed!) global economic catalysts, driving this growth and developing a consumer market relies fundamentally on having an educated and skilled workforce.
However, a large proportion of India's population across semi-urban and rural areas continues to have low purchasing power, and largely continues to make a living through agriculture. The World Bank reports that almost 47 per cent of India's employed population is engaged in agriculture, and yet the sector only contributes to about 14 per cent of the country GDP . The gap is staggering!
While skill development, as discussed in a recent Business Today article, remains one of our biggest challenges, the root of this imbalance lies in the low quality and efficacy of primary education.
Diversity of Challenges
The poor learning outcomes are a result of a wide variety of challenges. Infrastructural and human capital barriers ranging from low-teacher motivations to linguistic diversity to the bureaucratic administrative systems are adversely impacting progress.
Let's look at some of these challenges closely:
a. Improving access to education, but not quality: The Annual Status of Education Report points to positive statistics, including a steady increase in private school enrolment from 18.7 per cent in 2006 to 29 per cent in 2013; and the proportion of schools complying with the Right to Education's pupil-teacher ratio norms increasing by nearly seven per cent in the past three years. But a closer look helps get a deeper understanding. Only about half of the Standard V children can read a Standard II level text. In arithmetic, a significant share of the children is lagging several years behind where they are expected to be. From an economic standpoint, this translates to unemployable workforce and productivity deficit.
b. Probably, an overworked primary school teachers: Primary school teachers employed by the government, particularly in rural India, are required to perform a wide range of duties completely unrelated to imparting education. These duties, including administering government programmes such as immunisation clinics, assisting with data collection for the national census, and staffing polling stations during elections, in addition to their teaching responsibilities, place significant demands on teachers' time.
c. Bureaucratic administrative system making implementation difficult: It is difficult to test new practices on a small scale before rolling them out. If a new programme has been developed, it becomes evident that every school must have it. Such indiscriminate application often means that teachers are implementing programmes without understanding their key principles and ultimate goals.
So, can entrepreneurs help create a more productive ecosystem? Another barrier adversely impacting the quality of primary education appears to be low levels of teacher motivation. The usual culprit, compensation, does not seem to be problem. The starting salary range for a government primary school teacher is between Rs16,000 and Rs 22,000 per month, depending on the state, with additional benefits of public healthcare and retirement pensions.
A number of entrepreneurs have started realising the immense potential in the primary education system in India and as a result, we have a few innovative products and services:
a. Teachers as business owners: Andhra Pradesh-based Sudiksha, aims to address this challenge by developing teachers as 'business owners'. The organisation employs a grassroot entrepreneurship model by training young women within the society to run the schools as an enterprise. Although it is a pre-school centre, the programme helps develop schools focusing on the low-income urban and semi-urban regions, managed by entrepreneurs from within the community. Most children's parents are daily wage labour or work in small businesses. Sudiksha has grown from six schools in 2011 to 25 schools by mid-2013, and has raised funding from Pearson Affordable Learning Fund.
b. Social enterprise enabling learning through peer instructions and group learning: Motivation apart, experts point to lack of qualifications on the part of the teachers, and the lack of support system, to be another major contributor to poor outcomes. This problem is often compounded by flawed teaching techniques.
Avanti, a hybrid social enterprise, aims to tackle this by enabling students to learn through peer instructions and group learning, rather than the traditional teacher-centric delivery. Volunteers from top engineering schools spend two to three hours a week to mentor the students. The organisation focuses on high potential low-income students, and operates five centres in the metro/big cities- Mumbai, Delhi and Kanpur. As a conscious effort to create access for the poorer section of society, students are eligible only if their family has an average annual income of less than Rs 2,50,000. As a fee, the students pay about a sixth of the available alternatives.
c. Using technology to provide accessible learning: Organisations are also leveraging technology, to reduce the onus on the teachers and provide accessible learning. K-Yan, developed by IL&FS Education in collaboration with IIT Bombay, is an integrated community computer that folds in a projector and a foldable screen. With built in webcam and Internet connectivity, this device makes a classroom portable, and opens up opportunities for community learning and anytime study. Taking the classrooms to the children in open fields and grounds, can dramatically improve interactivity and reduce absenteeism.
K-Yan can also be powered by inverters or a car battery, which is critical considering only about half of primary schools have access to electricity in India.
d. Content digitisation for an immersive learning experience: Another big trend in primary education is the digitisation of educational content to enable learning experiences beyond classrooms, at the student's reach. Harvard professor Clayton Christensen had argued that half of K-12 education will be online by 2019.
Started in 2009, Attano is India's first educational eBook store. Their products are now being used by students in more than 80 towns in India, and a lot of that is outside bigger cities. The company claims a lot of the traffic is coming from Tier-II cities. Attano believes that students seek classroom-like immersive learning experience in their hands, at home or outside. It is worth noting, that the reduced cost of mobile devices and increased Internet penetration has helped the proliferation of online educational content.
But despite of all these initiatives in place, one must wonder, will these businesses and newer technologies enable India achieve the optimal level of primary education? I think more 'will power' along with increased level of investments targeted at the primary education sector is required to trigger this change.

Oil falls $3 to 4-year low after OPEC leaves output unchangedpetrol
Brent crude oil fell more than $3 to a fresh four-year low under $75 a barrel on Thursday after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) decided not to cut production, despite a huge oversupply in world markets.
Asked whether the oil producer group had decided not to reduce production, Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi told reporters: “That is right.’’ Oil prices have fallen by more than a third since June as increasing production in North America from shale oil has overwhelmed demand at a time of sluggish global economic growth.
Ministers from OPEC had been discussing whether to agree a production cut at their meeting in Vienna.
Benchmark Brent futures were down by $2.96 a barrel at $74.79 by 1520 GMT, after hitting a low of $74.36, their lowest since August 2010.
U.S. crude was at $71.07, down $2.62.
Kuwaiti Oil Minister Ali Saleh al-Omair said there would be ‘no change’ to OPEC’s existing oil production target following the meeting. The cartel will meet again in June next year, said an OPEC delegate.
Output target at 30 million barrels
OPEC oil ministers have decided to keep their present output target at 30 million barrels a day, despite an oversupply of crude and plunging prices.
The decision on Thursday was expected. OPEC oil power Saudi Arabia had indicated before the meeting that it favoured the status-quo.
The Saudis are the top producers within the 12-nation organisation and effectively decide the cartel’s policy.
Some less well-off members had favoured a cut, to reduce supplies and push prices back up.
But because of booming shale production in the U.S., that would not have made a sizable dent in supply.

After Kotak deal  more bank takeovers on cardsDevidutta Tripathy and Sumeet Chatterjee     Mumbai   Last Updated: November 29, 2014  | 13:43 IST
(Photo for representation only)
India is set for more banking acquisitions after a record $2.4 billion takeover last week ended four years of a deals drought, as lenders fight for market share and wider reach amid looming competition from a new breed of players.
Kotak Mahindra Bank agreed last week to buy ING Vysya in India's biggest bank deal.
"Deals will happen in the banking sector, but relatively fewer compared to mergers in other non-regulated sectors," said Sanjay Doshi, a partner at consultancy KPMG, referring to segments such as industrials and consumer where there is no sector-specific regulator.
Any deals, though, will be subject to close regulatory scrutiny and may face other hurdles, meaning they are expected at a steady clip rather than in a torrent.
A banking sector consolidation should support an expected recovery in Asia's third-largest economy through creation of stronger lenders that will control the growth of bad loans and make credit availability easier.
The Indian banking sector is fragmented, with 46 commercial banks jostling for business with dozens of foreign banks as well as rural and co-operative lenders. State banks control 80 percent of the market, leaving relatively small shares for private rivals.
The state-run banks are unlikely to be part of any takeovers involving private sector rivals as the government has not been keen to bless such transactions. But the private sector, which accounts for nearly half the total number of commercial banks, could see deal activity.
New private players were earlier this year allowed to enter the sector for the first time in a decade, and the central bank plans to grant more bank licences. As a result, some large conglomerates are expected to jump in the fray.
With the incumbents keen to fortify themselves against the new competition and as the new players try to scale-up quickly, takeovers are clearly on the cards, say financial industry executives.
Among the conglomerates, the Aditya Birla group and billionaire Anil Ambani's Reliance Capital are keen on the banking sector and will be eyeing deals to expand quickly after they get permits, say investment bankers. The central bank's stance on allowing conglomerates into banking is unclear.
Some of the bigger private sector players - No. 3 private sector lender Axis Bank, IndusInd Bank and Yes Bank - are also potential acquirers, dealmakers say.
Axis, IndusInd, Yes Bank, Reliance and Birla Group did not respond to requests for comment.
Targets include smaller banks that are localised, but with a high number of urban branches, like western India's DCB Bank and Karnataka Bank, investment bankers said.
DCB's Chief Executive Murali Natrajan said the bank had no plan to merge with any bank, adding they aimed to double the balance sheet size in 36-42 months. Karnataka Bank did not respond to a request for comment.
HURDLES
The central bank is also facilitating the setting up of 'payments banks' , which take deposits and facilitate transactions but do not lend, and which could eat into the banks' margins.
While the economic rationale for the deals is growing, they face practical hurdles. Pricing of deals is one such. Many founders of small banks see their licenses as prized assets for which they will demand a high price, even though most private sector banks are already trading at significant premiums to their book values.
Bank employee unions also can pose problems, if they fear major job losses in a takeover.
"The banking sector needs consolidation, but ... consolidation will move at a moderate pace in India in the near to medium term," said the head of M&A for India at a large European bank in Mumbai.

Why IPO exits are most sought-after by PE fundsMahesh Nayak      Follow @MaheshNayak    Edition: Dec 7, 2014
(Photo: Ajay Thakuri)
The corporate office of Ratnakar Bank in Lower Parel, Mumbai, has been buzzing with keyboard clicks and shifting of documents. The bank is deep in the throes of a frenzy to prepare for its initial public offering (IPO).
The echoes of this clicking and shifting can be heard a few floors above, where the offices of Aditya Birla Capital Advisors (ABCA) are brimming with cautious enthusiasm. Bharat Banka, Senior President with Aditya Birla Group, who was earlier the CEO of ABCA, says the fund plans to dilute its three per cent stake in Ratnakar Bank during the IPO. It hopes to get Rs 150 crore to Rs 225 crore for its holding, which would be a return of two to 2.5 times on the Rs 75 crore the private equity (PE) arm of the Aditya Birla Group had invested in the bank less than two years ago.
That anticipated exit from Ratnakar Bank would be in the midst of a purple patch for ABCA. Set up six years ago, it had raised Rs 1,200 crore through two funds: Aditya Birla Private Equity Fund 1 and Aditya Birla Private Equity Sunrise Fund. It invested parts of that money in Coffee Day Resort, Credit Analysis and Research (CARE), BSE, Tree House, Wonderla, City Union Bank and Indian Energy Exchange. Of those it has exited CARE, Tree House and Wonderla, making returns of two to three times.
There is one more reason for optimism as the Ratnakar Bank IPO comes along. Henderson, another PE fund, exited Sharda Cropchem in an IPO in September for a return of Rs 223 crore on its six-year-old investment of Rs 100 crore - a healthy 2.23 times.
Cashing out
In the many interesting ways that the PE industry reads the tea leaves, the Sharda IPO has encouraged a bunch of PE funds to egg on their investee companies to approach the market with share sale proposals. The prominent ones among these are Adlabs Entertainment, Monte Carlo Fashions and Power Mech Projects.
"With market sentiments improving, one is bound to see exits," says Vishakha Mulye, the ICICI Venture CEO. She is counting down to the IPO of Adlabs Entertainment, in which ICICI-V invested Rs 144 crore in August last year for 17.8 per cent equity.
A good exit, with good returns, is what PEs live for. Within that, the IPO exit is the most sought-after, as that is when a company gets truly valued by the market. That is not the case with sale to financial or strategic investors. A good exit during an IPO makes money for the Limited Partners (LPs), those who park their monies with PE funds, and helps funds convince more people to trust them with their monies.
Jayanta Banerjee, Managing Partner, ASK Pravi Capital Advisors
"Exits through IPO look good on the fund manager's CV," says Jayanta Banerjee, Managing Partner at ASK Pravi Capital Advisors, a Mumbai-based PE fund manager. "But this route was closed for a long time."
The demand for IPOs was dormant, indeed non-existent, because investors had tuned out of the equities market - secondary (stock market deals) as well as primary (IPOs) - because of uncertainty on the domestic as well as overseas fronts. Debt, with its promise of security of investment, was by far the more popular option.
This may seem anachronistic because the Sensitive Index of the Bombay Stock Exchange (Sensex) has been for some time exploring new highs. But the rise began in February 2014 just before the Modi government came to power. Even so, the rise is selective, driven by Sensex heavyweights like Hindustan Unilever, TCS and Infosys. The wider market has only now begun to perk up on hopes of deep economic reforms by a decisive government.
But perking up it is, and that has put wind beneath the wings of IPO aspirants. And PEs are flying high, dreaming once again of the ultimate glory through IPO exits. And that brings us to PE cycles.
In India as well as overseas, PE investments move, roughly, in seven-year cycles, bookended on one side by investments and on the other by exits.
The PE era started in India with Warburg Pincus putting in $292 million in Bharti Airtel in 1999 for 18 per cent equity. It exited in 2005 with $1.6 billion, making it a landmark in every sense - timing, opportunity, and return - and triggered a raft of PE deals involving fund houses like ChrysCapital, ICICI Venture, Citi Venture Capital, IL&FS, Morgan Stanley, Temasek, Actis, General Atlantic, IDFC, Baring, etc.
Some of the investments turned out to be lucrative. ChrysCapital made 13 times returns on its Yes Bank investment over three and a half years. Henderson made 2.5 times in HT Media. ICICI Ventures four times in PVR.
This first cycle of PE investments in India ended in 2004-06, with ChrysCapital making a successful exit from Gammon India, Citi from I-Flex, and others.
The successes in the first cycle created more interest among global funds in the India story. Blackstone, Carlyle, KKR, TPG, Advent, Goldman Sachs set up shop in the country. Some home-grown funds took shape: ASK Pravi, Motilal Oswal, Banyan Tree, Lighthouse, CX Partners. With a spring in their step, they braced up for the next cycle. That was when it all went down.
As with so many of the best-laid plans, the Indian PE story, too, was undone by the global financial meltdown that officially set in with Lehman Brothers going under in September 2008. The story since then has been one of drudgery and misery, with only sporadic bright sparks.
"India has been a tough story. Unlike the first cycle, in which there was less competition and abnormal returns, the second cycle has been pretty sad," says Aluri Rao, Managing Director at Morgan Stanley Private Equity Asia.
Numbers bear her out. The first round saw PE investments of $5 billion to $6 billion, on which the funds reaped an Internal Rate of Return of 25 to 26 per cent as the Sensex rose from around 3,000 in 2002 to about 9,000 in 2005.
This fervour carried over into the next cycle, with $35 billion worth of PE investments coming in between 2006 and 2008, when the Sensex rose from 9,000 to 21,000. The sins of those days - euphoric deals made at high valuations - are still being atoned for.
About two-thirds of the money invested in that period is still stuck, as the exit options slammed shut. According to market grapevine, funds like Clearwater were forced to make exits at returns of 0.6 to 0.8 times as the life of the fund ended and money had to be returned to LPs. Rajesh Khanna, who left his position as Managing Director at Warburg to start his own fund, Arka Capital, could not raise money and shut shop. Steer Capital, set up by Neeraj Bhargava, who left WNS, and Harsha Raghavan, who left Candover India, met the same fate.
Part of the struggle is to find good companies to invest in. That has led some PEs to shed the core character of a PE, which is to invest in companies that have not yet gone public, and go after listed companies. Advent India PE Advisors, a PE fund, opened its India office five years ago but has invested directly only in two companies. Says Shweta Jalan, the Managing Director: "In India large deals will be fewer."
PE-backed IPO pipeline
Many see that dreadful second cycle as having come to an end. They believe the third has begun, with renewed hope and promises of IPO exits. In July this year Morgan Stanley raised $1.7 billion for its fourth Asia Fund, which would focus on Korea, China and India. "We have been among the few people to have returned more than what we took from investors," says Rao, who had raised $2.6 billion from investors and given $3.6 billion back to them. No wonder, he says: "This current cycle is better than the second." However, in the same breath, he adds: "But it has to be seen if it is better than the first."
The answer will depend on the exits on the anvil. Without good exits, the funds will not find LPs. "There are no second chances," says M.K. Sinha, CEO at IDFC Alternatives, a PE fund. "Investors expect you to generate 22 to 25 per cent returns. They understand the environment, but still won't accept lower returns. If you can't make money, you have no option but to shut shop."
That brings up the prospect of a shakeout. But that would mean bloodshed, because consolidation in the PE industry is always an unlikely event, given the lifecycle of funds. That is why IDFC Alternative's Sinha and Aditya Birla's Banka have pinned their hopes on exits.
"In the next six months I would like to exit four to five companies, of which some will be sold to strategic investors, and at least one to a financial investor. Another exit may come through an IPO," says Sinha, as he prepares to set up a fourth PE fund. "I want to go to investors with my performance and therefore the focus is on exit."
That performance, he admits, may be a mixed bag. "My second fund will be subdued, but the third will deliver decent returns. I will do better than my peers. At least, I give capital back to my investors."
The tempering of ambition is clear in Sinha's statement. But even the tempered target must be achieved in a finite period.
"The window of exits will be open for another three to six months as the mood will continue to remain buoyant on hopes of reform," says Rabindra Jhunjhunwala, who looks after the PE practice at Mumbai-based law firm Khaitan & Co.
When a lawyer talks like that, you know you have to pay attention.

Its time literature dealt with the anti-heroine: Gillian Flynn and Cheryl StrayedPosted: November 30, 2014 1:33 am | Updated: November 30, 2014 11:20 am
The pairing of Gillian Flynn and Cheryl Strayed seems at once too obvious and not obvious enough.
Obvious because both are women writers who happen to have had best-selling books optioned by Reese Witherspoon and made into high-octane, swinging-for-the-fences films. And not obvious enough because Flynn specialises in probing dark, unsavoury recesses of the human psyche, like her anti-heroine Amy in the 2012 novel Gone Girl. Strayed rocketed to fame the same year with her memoir Wild, about her redemptive 1,100-mile trek along the Pacific Crest Trail as a brokenhearted divorced 26-year-old grieving the early death of her mother.
Yet the authors share similarities that run deep. Feminists both, they create bluntly authentic, deeply engaging stories through characters that defy stereotypes. They have also forged roads to Hollywood gold. Directed by David Fincher and adapted by Flynn herself, the film Gone Girl has earned more than $300 million globally. Wild, directed by Jean-Marc Vallee and starring Witherspoon, is one of the season’s most anticipated films. Flynn, 43, has a newborn, her second child, and lives with her family in Chicago, and Strayed, 46, happened to be in town with her husband and two children. Excerpts from their conversation.
Witherspoon wanted to create better roles for women, but has Gone Girl shown women in a better role? Is it empowering or continuing stereotypes?
Flynn: I’ve been asked that a lot, and to me the answer is always: ‘Of course, it’s not misogynistic.’ Women shouldn’t be expected to only play nurturing, kind caretakers. That’s always been part of my goal — to show the dark side of women. Men write about bad men all the time, and they’re called anti-heroes. I had about 24 hours where I hovered under my covers and was like: ‘I killed feminism. Why did I do that? Rats! I did not mean to do that’. And then I very quickly kind of felt comfortable with what I had written.
Cheryl, it’s your story, but did you get blowback from people, or was it just more relief at having told an honest story?
Strayed: One of the most difficult things reading about the movie Wild was when people started writing about it and me in this shorthand way. Often, they’ll say my problems were self-inflicted. And really the two biggest problems I began the trail with were the opposite of self-inflicted: the dead mother and the abusive father who wasn’t in my life. Those were my two most significant wounds, neither of which I inflicted upon myself, both of which I had to heal in myself.
Is there a double standard, where male characters don’t get that level of scrutiny?
Flynn: The likability thing, especially in Hollywood, is a constant conversation. What I read and what I go to the movies for is not to find a best friend, not to find inspirations, not necessarily for a hero’s journey. It’s to be involved with characters continued…

Militants gun down sarpanch in KashmirMalala Yousafzai: 'Heartbroken' about attack in Pakistan
In an audacious attack, militants tonight shot dead sarpanch of the ruling National Conference in Shopian district of Kashmir near his residence.
Mohammad Sultan Bhat was in his car when, about 500 metres from his residence in Nazneenpora in Shopian when the ultras stopped his vehicle and pumped bullets at him from close range at around 9.30 pm, police said.
Bhat died on the spot while the assailants managed to escape, it said.
Extending condolences to the sarpanch’s family, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said Bhat’s death “will only spur us on to remain steadfast and committed to our mission of a peaceful, prosperous new Jammu & Kashmir.”
“He joins the many hundreds of NC cadre killed for their political beliefs,” Omar tweeted.
Omar said the National Conference will tomorrow formally request the Election Commission to review security in this area. “We are concerned about gaps in the security grid,” he said.
“The EC code forbids me from any engagement with the security forces so the EC is now responsible for plugging any loopholes,” he said.
The killing comes a day after a grenade attack in Srinagar in which eight people were injured.
On November 28, ten people had lost their lives in militant attack in Arnia sector, while yesterday militants had also triggered a blast targeting an army vehicle near LoC in Poonch, but the troops escaped unhurt.

Rate cut pressure on RBI: this time its the marketsTata Steel close to reopening its top iron ore mine
On September 23 — a week before the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) last monetary policy review — 10 state governments together raised Rs 8,100 crore of 10-year market loans at cut-off yields ranging from 8.9 per cent to 8.99 per cent.
Last Tuesday, 14 states managed to mop up Rs 15,225 crore again through 10-year paper. But this time, the yields were between 8.43 and 8.46 per cent.
What changed in these two months? Well, RBI did not bring down its overnight lending (“repo”) rate, which remains at 8 per cent. Yet, state governments have seen their borrowings costs fall by 50-odd basis points.
Since RBI’s last bi-monthly review on September 30, yields on the Centre’s benchmark 10-year security have dropped from 8.51 to 8.09 per cent.
It is even more against the peak of 9.1 per cent on April 7. Then, too, the repo rate was 8 per cent.
But it isn’t just government bonds.
Since September 30, rates on corporate borrowings against one-year commercial paper — basically unsecured promissory notes — have come down by roughly 40 basis points to 8.9 per cent-levels.
Banks, likewise, are now mobilising funds through one-year tradable certificates of deposits at around 8.6 per cent, which is also a dip of 40 basis points.
Simply put, interest rates are falling without RBI doing anything. While even until two months ago the pressure to reduce policy rates was mainly from the finance ministry or CII and Ficci, today this is coming from the financial markets that are seemingly telling the RBI it has no option but to cut.
A good indicator of the market cues is the huge investor demand for bonds issued at high coupon rates. The expectation of interest rates falling has pushed up their prices and correspondingly driven down yield-to-maturity (YTM) to even below the original coupon levels.
Thus, a two-year non-convertible debenture of Larsen & Toubro issued on August 22 at 9.15 per cent is currently trading at an annualised YTM of 8.45 per cent on the National Stock Exchange.
Another indicator is bond spreads — the difference between yields on government securities and corporate bonds of similar maturity. These have declined from about 65 basis points to 40 basis points since September 30, which point to reduced risks associated with investing in bonds.
The question being asked is: even if RBI continues to ignore the rants of North Block or industry associations, can it ignore the markets that are clearly betting on rate reductions happening sooner than later?
Rana Kapoor, MD & CEO of Yes Bank, expects a 50 basis points cut in the repo rate in December itself.
DR Dogra, managing director of CARE Ratings, feels a rate cut is unlikely now and “RBI may choose to defer the decision for the policy review in February”.
Ashish Vaidya, executive director and head of trading at DBS India, notes that “a softening bias on rates” was apparent, but also believes that RBI will initiate cuts only from February.
“Inflation, both core and headline, seems to be coming down faster than anticipated. India is one of the few countries now offering 2 per cent positive real interest rates and that is a huge return for investors in the present world economic scenario,” Vaidya added.
The biggest driving factor behind the marked change in interest rate outlook in the last two months has been global oil prices.
Since May 26, when the Narendra Modi-led government was sworn in, the average price of crude imported by Indian refiners has plunged from $108.05 to $72.51 a barrel. And almost two-thirds of this has taken place post September 30.
According to Sajjid Chinoy, Chief India Economist at JP Morgan, inflation risks have no doubt reduced, but RBI would need to be sure whether the current dynamics endure: “Any monetary easing will only commence when the central bank has a firmer conviction of meeting its 6 per cent inflation target.”

I think by Dec 2015 there should be a rate cut between 50-100 bps: Keki MistryTata Steel close to reopening its top iron ore mine
Amid the chorus for an interest rate cut from the Reserve Bank of India in its forthcoming monetary policy review on Tuesday, Keki Mistry, vice chairman and CEO of HDFC Ltd said that the central bank may wait for one more policy before going for a rate cut. In an interview to Sandeep Singh, Mistry said that going further, rates could be cut by up to 100 basis points . Excerpts:
While oil prices have slipped and GDP growth is down to 5.3 per cent, do you see RBI going for a cut in interest rates now?
RBI will certainly start cutting the rates but not now. While there may be a cut even on Tuesday, I personally feel that they would wait for one more month and see how the inflation numbers show up. Based on it they may do it in the next policy review meeting.
How much interest rate cut do you see over the next one year?
If everything else remains in line, I think by December 2015 there should be a rate cut between 50-100 basis points.
How do see that affecting the housing market which has seen a slowdown?
There was never a slowdown, it has been business as usual. But certainly with the economy looking to pick up, it will lead to higher activity in the sector and more demand for housing.
How do you see India positioned currently?
From a global standpoint, India is in a sweet spot. Commodity prices, oil prices and inflation are down and everything that one would like to see from a macroeconomic perspective on India is happening now, and people are looking at India with tremendous amount of interest. China is slowing down and Russia and Brazil too are not doing well but India is ready to go at a different platform. Nobody is expecting that we will start growing at 7 per cent in a hurry. People are willing to wait for it.
Do you see a pick up in the investment cycle now?
The economy is on the right track and business sentiments are at an all time high and people in business are now looking to invest. While there are some who still have excess capacity there are many who are now looking to invest. It is only a matter of time that the investment cycle will pick up and people will start investing in plant and machinery.

Braveheart sisters thrash three eve-teasers as others look onMustering courage, two harassed college-going sisters thrashed three eve-teasers inside a moving bus with passengers remaining mute spectators to their plight.
Police said all the three youths — Kuldeep, Mohit and Deepak — have been arrested.
“We have arrested the three accused and they will be produced before court,” Rohtak SP Shanshank Anand said over phone.
A case under section 354 (assault or criminal force with intent to outrage woman’s modesty) and section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) have been registered against them, he said.
The incident triggered spontaneous indignation from women rights activists, with National Commission for Women chairperson Lalitha Kumarmangalam asking the authorities to take appropriate action against he accused.
Both sisters confronted the accused, with one of the girls even hitting the youths with her belt.
The entire incident, recorded by a passenger on mobile phone, went viral both on television and social media. It showed the two girls using hand and belt to thrash the eve teasers, who appeared to be taken by surpise.
The parents of the two girls lodged an FIR with Haryana police against the three youths informing that the molesters got down at the Kansla village in Rohtak.
The victims in their complaint alleged that they were “teased” by some youths in a Haryana Roadways bus when they were going to their college on Friday.
When the victims objected, one of the accused started beating them up.
Not go give up easily, the girls fought with the accused as fellow passengers remained mute spectators. One of the victims even hit the accused with a belt, police said.
One of the girls said, “They threatened us and abused us. One of them touched my sister inappropriately. They started making obscene gestures … After heated exchanges, one of the boys called his friends asking him to beat us up. One of them beat my sister while two others caught hold of me.
“Then, I whipped out my belt at thrashed them. They pushed us out of the bus when it slowed down,” she narrated.
The girl also said that she called the emergency helpline number but the response from the other end was that they will return the call within two minutes. However, there was no response.
She said that instead of helping them, some passengers advised them against fighting with the boys, warning that they might even be killed another day.
“None of the passengers came to our rescue. While some watched the drama, others were apprehensive fearing for their own safety,” one girl said.
Meanwhile, the father of the two sisters alleged that there was pressure from the panchayat that the girls should withdraw the complaint.
Reacting strongly to the incident, women rights activist Abha Singh said, “It’s an offence under Section 354a. This is a non-bailable offence. The culprits must be arrested immediately. The people in bus did not come to the help of the girls. We need to amend the law that those who don’t help the victims of molestation should also be punished.
Commenting on the incident, National Commission for Women chairperson Lalitha Kumarmangalam said, “I would like to congratulate the girls and ask the authorities to take appropriate action. Few girls have the guts to take on the molesters. The government should take action. I would appeal to every Indian to come forward and help.”

The stock market snapped four-session rising streak on Monday with the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) index Sensex tumbling 134.37 points to 28,559.62 and the National Stock Exchange (NSE) Nifty falling 32.35 points to 8,555.90 on caution ahead of Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) monetary policy review and weak global cues.
Oil and gas stocks were the biggest laggards after global crude prices hit a five-year low. Power, metal and capital goods shares also witnessed sharp selling.
Consumer durable stocks spurted on good buying. Auto shares saw some activity after release of monthly sales.
Participants preferred to sit on the sidelines and booked some profit ahead of RBI's monetary policy review scheduled for Tuesday , said Jayant Manglik, President-retail distribution, Religare Securities.
The 30-share benchmark BSE Sensex, after rising to an intra-day high of 28,809.64 on the back of initial buying, declined to 28,538.44 on profit-booking. The gauge ended at 28,559.62, logging a fall of 0.47 per cent.
In the previous three sessions, Sensex had rallied over 355 points. On Friday, it had zoomed to intra-day record high of 28,822.37 and ended at record peak of 28,693.99.
Among the 30 Sensex scrips, stocks like ONGC, Hindalco, BHEL, RIL, Tata Power, Tata Steel, M&M and Sesa Sterlite ended lower.
On similar lines, the broader 50-issue NSE Nifty opened at 8,605.10 and hit a fresh high of 8,623.00 before closing 32.35 points (or 0.38 per cent) lower at 8,555.90.
After gross domestic product (GDP) grew at 5.3 per cent in the September-quarter, an HSBC survey showed manufacturing sector output accelerated in November at the quickest pace in 2 years.

Jewellery stocks , including Gitanjali Gems and Titan Company, shined after the central bank scrapped the 80:20 rule and restrictions on gold imports.

Nov HSBC Manufacturing PMI at 21-month high | Brent@$67.90Factory growth
(The HSBC Manufacturing…)
NEW DELHI: India's manufacturing sector output accelerated in November at the quickest pace in nearly two years, driven by robust output and new orders, an HSBC survey said today.
The headline HSBC India Purchasing Managers' Index ( PMI ) -- a composite gauge designed to give a single-figure snapshot of manufacturing business conditions -- stood at 53.3 in November significantly higher from 51.6 in October.
The manufacturing sector output, improved for the 13th month in a row and reached a 21-month peak in November.
A figure above 50 indicates the sector is expanding, while a figure below that level means contraction.
"Manufacturing activity accelerated further in November led by higher output and new orders. Domestic orders saw the biggest increase, even as new export orders continued to be strong," HSBC Co-Head of Asian Economic Research Frederic Neumann said.
November data indicated stronger-than-expected demand, as new order growth accelerated to the quickest in 21 months. Similarly, foreign orders received by Indian goods producers continued to rise strongly in November.
In spite of accelerated expansions in output and new business, employment in the manufacturing sector remained broadly unchanged in November, the report said.
"The sharp rise in input prices was surprising, but future prints may be lower as falling commodity prices eventually lead to softer intermediate good prices. Meanwhile, the pick-up in output prices could partly be signalling some revival in pricing power among businesses," Neumann said.
A cautionary note was, however, provided by the HSBC survey regarding input costs and output charges, as inflationary pressures intensified during the month following three consecutive months of easing.
"Higher output and an uptick in final prices should convince the RBI to stay on hold in the upcoming meeting," Neumann said.
The RBI, which has maintained the interest at elevated level for the past 10 months, is scheduled to announce it policy review tomorrow.
According to official figure, wholesale inflation came down to a five-year low at 1.77 per cent in October while retail inflation hit a record low of 5.52 per cent in the same month.
Meanwhile, the country's economic growth fell to 5.3 per cent in the second quarter from 5.7 per cent rate in the first three-month period ended June, raising the clamour for rate cut by the RBI tomorrow.

Ministry of External Affairs to lobby Korea, Japan for shipping technology

(“Why should these companies…)
NEW DELHI: GAIL India needs nine ships to ferry six million tonnes of liquefied natural gas that it's contracted to buy from the US starting September 2017. Of these, three LNG carriers need to be made in India.
But with key South Korean and Japanese shipbuilders staying away from bidding process for this, the shipping ministry has called on the foreign ministry for assistance.
The idea is to lobby South Korea to push its companies to provide technology support to domestic yards, especially since Samsung and Hyundai—both of which have shipbuilding arms of repute— have found a lucrative market in India for their refrigerators, cars, phones and other products. This is their chance to play a significant in the Make in India campaign to make the country a manufacturing base, the shipping ministry has argued.
"Why should these companies keep themselves only to auto, telecom sectors when we can really use their expertise in a crucial area like shipbuilding," a senior government official said. There doesn't seem to be much time left. Since India does not have the expertise, an international partner has to be finalised by 2015 to provide quality assurance, training and supervision.
The Shipping Corporation will be running these ships in partnership with GAIL. Only one company, South Korea's STX Offshore, has thus far agreed to share technology to make LNG vessels at Indian shipyards.
While STX Offshore matches most of the bid requirements, its poor net worth and weak order book raise concerns about viability. To be sure, the South Korean Development Bank , with a 97% stake in STX, has assured the government of its financial support for the GAIL project. Still, with just days to go before the last date for bids closes on December 4, GAIL is in a bit of a bind.
The shipping ministry wants leading shipbuilders, including Hyundai , Daewoo and Samsung to step up and offer to partner Indian shipyards, which have never built such vessels before. LNG carriers require highly specialised technology in order to store the gas in cryogenic conditions.
Japanese and South Korean shipyards are known for their expertise in making such vessels at a price that's competitive compared with European yards. However, government officials said that countries guard this knowhow closely and do not want to part with it even on commercial terms, which is why so few bids have come in.
Japanese yards have cited a labour crunch and said they don't have enough personnel to supervise construction in India, with too many orders to meet. Cochin Shipyard , which has partnered with Japan in ship design and construction before, failed to get a positive response from companies there.

Six ways to help you save tax next time you pay it | ET WealthSix ways to help you save tax next time you pay it

(Faulty investment strategies…)
Everybody complains about high taxes, but in the lowerand mid-income groups, the effective tax rate is not very high. A person with a taxable income of Rs 40,000 a month will pay only 3.2% of his income in tax.
Someone earning Rs 80,000 a month will pay 9.5%. This assumes that these taxpayers will invest at least 15% of their income in tax-saving options under Section 80C.
Yet, many taxpayers believe they are paying too much tax. They could be right. Faulty investment strategies, poor awareness about tax rules and tardiness could be exacting a high tax from some of the individuals.
One of the most common reasons for paying higher tax is the inability to avail of the full deduction under Section 80C. If you procrastinate tax planning and wake up at the end of February, there's a good chance that you won't be able to utilise the entire Rs 1.5 lakh tax-saving limit. "If you save regularly, you won't face any problem at the end of the financial year," advises Sudhir Kaushik, Cofounder and Chief Financial Officer of tax filing portal Taxspanner.com. Last year, Taxspanner noted that nearly 51% of the salaried taxpayers who used their portal to file tax returns had not fully exhausted the Rs 1 lakh saving limit under Section 80C. The figure might be higher next year because this year's budget has enhanced the saving limit to Rs 1.5 lakh.
This week's cover story looks at some of the most common reasons that taxpayers end up paying more tax. We also offer suggestions on how to avoid this higher outgo of tax by realigning investments and optimising the tax deductions that are available. If you are also following a faulty investment strategy or are not aware of the various rules that can help save tax, the nuggets of information in the following pages can prove invaluable for you.
Investing in tax-inefficient options
Fixed deposits are hot favourites of Indian investors. Nearly 56% of total household savings are parked in these deposits. But these are also very tax inefficient. The entire interest earned on the fixed deposit is taxed as income at the rate applicable to the investor. In the highest tax bracket, 30.9% tax pares the post-tax yield of these deposits significantly. Recurring deposits, infrastructure bonds and small saving schemes such as NSCs and the newly relaunched Kisan Vikas Patra get the same tax treatment.
  Patra get the same tax treatment. What's particularly galling is that you have to pay the tax on the interest that accrues every year, even though you might get the amount only on maturity. If you invested in a 10-year cumulative fixed deposit in April 2014, you will get the principal and the interest in 2024. But you will have to pay tax on the interest it earns every year.
But there are other more tax efficient debt instruments on offer. Debt funds allow you to defer the tax till you withdraw the investment. If you hold them for three years, you also get the benefit of lower tax. The income from debt funds is treated as long-term capital gains after three years and taxed at 20% after indexation.
Indexation takes into account the inflation during the holding period and accordingly adjusts the buying price to reduce the tax liability of the investor. An investor in the 30% tax bracket would have to pay Rs 9,670 in tax on a 3-year fixed deposit of Rs 1 lakh. But if he invests in a debt mutual fund or a 3-year FMP, he can get away by paying a tax of only Rs 175.
Many investors like Rajesh Varma (see picture) are not aware of debt funds and the benefits they offer. They are under the misconception that mutual funds only invest in stocks. It would save them a lot of tax if they replace the fixed deposits in their portfolios with debt schemes.
Not utilising HRA benefit
The house rent allowance (HRA) is usually a substantial chunk of the salary. Those living in rented accommodation can avail of deduction under Section 10(13A). If you live in your own house, you can't avail of this deduction. However, if you live in your parents' house, there is a way out. You can pay them rent and claim HRA exemption. This is possible only if the property is registered in the name of your parent. This is a useful strategy if you are in the higher tax bracket and your parent's income is lower.
Your parent will be taxed for the rental income after a 30% deduction. So, if you pay your father a rent of Rs 4.2 lakh a year (Rs 35,000 a month), he will be taxed for only Rs 2.94 lakh. If the parent is a senior citizen with no other taxable income, one can effectively pay Rs 35,700 a month without adding a rupee to his tax liability. Mumbai-based Gargi Jain uses this clause very effectively to reduce her tax liability.
Even if the income exceeds the basic exemption limit of Rs 3 lakh for a senior citizen, the tax rate will be only 10% for income up to Rs 5 lakh. High income earners may find it cost-effective to pay rent to their parents and pay the applicable tax.

Govt collecting evidence against black money offenders: Ravi Shankar PrasadTata Steel close to reopening its top iron ore mine
Government is collecting evidence against those who have stashed black money abroad and the offenders will soon be punished, Communications and Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said today.
In an interview to news channel Aaj Tak’s show “Seedhi Baat,” he said that BJP in just five and half months has been able to achieve something which the Congress was unable to do in 10 years.
“We formed the SIT which Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi could not form in three years. Prime Minister Narendra Modi took up the issue of black money in G-20 and gave it an international colour and the entire world is today ready to cooperate on this issue.
“We have submitted the list of black money account holders to Supreme Court and SIT. In that 250 people have admitted that they have accounts in foreign banks. But for the sake of secrecy and to collect more evidence, we have not made the names public,” Prasad said.
In a statement issued by the channel, Prasad was quoted as saying that, “In just five and a half months, we have done that work which the Congress government could not do in ten years.”
He said that the government is collecting evidences and based on that, “we will soon send the criminals behind bars”.
When asked why his party is not having a discussion on the issue of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, the Minister said that Home Minister Rajnath Singh has already clarified that there will be a discussion on it, but Article 370 is not an election issue.
“Kashmir presently needs employment and good governance. Previous governments have deceived the Kashmiris. We have also said that three seats are reserved for Kashmiri Pandits. Talks are also going on to reserve seats for those Kashmiris displaced from Pakistan…
“The atmosphere in Kashmir is changing. People have chanted slogans like ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’ during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s rallies. People want a change in government. I think we would not have to compromise with any party – be it PDP or any other party,” the statement said quoting Prasad.

Samsung to launch Tizen smartphone in India: ReportEnforcement Directorate probing beneficiary of Rs 425 crore Indian Premier League facilitation fee
South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd plans to launch a new sub-$100 smartphone running on its own Tizen operating system in India later this month, South Korea’s Maeil Business Newspaper said on Monday.
The paper, a local business daily, said Samsung will hold a press conference on Dec. 10 to launch its first Tizen smartphone, to be called the Z1. A Samsung Electronics spokeswoman declined to comment.
Samsung had initially planned to launch a Tizen smartphone in Russia in the third quarter but scrapped the plan. The firm said at the time that it wanted to further enhance the ecosystem behind Tizen. Only a handful of devices, including the firm’s smartwatch products, currently run on the platform.
The majority of Samsung’s mobile devices are based on Google’s Android platform. The South Korean firm’s push to develop its own operating system is part of efforts to reduce dependence on the U.S. firm, but delays in product launches have undercut expectations.

Rs 64K cr lying unclaimed: Here s how you ca...Central Provident Fund
(Assuming a nominal rate…)
MUMBAI: An estimated Rs 37,300 crore is lying unclaimed with insurance companies, banks, corporate houses and the Post Office department. If you add the Rs 26,497 crore lying in inoperative provident fund accounts with the EPFO, the total wealth idling without interest adds up to nearly Rs. 64,000 crore.
Assuming a nominal rate of 8.5%, investors are losing more than Rs. 5,400 crore in interest every year. The interest alone can buy out a mid-sized bank such as Corporation Bank, which has a market capitalisation of Rs 5,367 crore. This estimate does not include many small savings schemes, data for which is unavailable.
One unconfirmed estimate has pegged the unclaimed amount and inoperative accounts in the Public Provident Fund (PPF) at Rs 22,000 crore. That's not unbelievable..
In July, in response to an RTI petition by Aseem Takyar, the Post Office department had divulged that Indira Vikas Patra maturity proceeds worth Rs 896 crore are lying unclaimed in government coffers.
The amount is enough to buy the entire equity of Financial Technologies, which has a market Rs 844 crore. Three months ago, the government set up a committee headed by RBI deputy governor HR Khan to find out how much of unclaimed deposits were lying with the Post Office department and PSU banks. The Khan Committee will submit its report by December 31.
The Post Office department is not the only black hole that has swallowed investors' wealth. Life insurance companies have Rs 5,849 crore of unpaid benefits in their coffers. The Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) has the biggest chunk (Rs 1,548 crore) of unclaimed wealth but Reliance Life Insurance is not far behind with Rs 1,502 crore. Banks too are wallowing in this unclaimed wealth, with Rs 5,125 crore waiting to be collected by depositors and account holders. Then there are corporate houses, which have roughly Rs 3,454 crore in unpaid dividends, unclaimed debentures and deposits.
The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) is also sitting on a massive Rs 26,496 crore in inoperative PF accounts. A PF account is classified as inoperative if there is no deposit for more than three years. Under a new rule introduced in 2011, no interest is payable on the balance in an inoperative account.
EPFO officials say that many of these inoperative accounts belong to people who have changed jobs and not transferred the balance from the previous account. Central Provident Fund Commissioner Krishan Kumar Jalan says the introduction of the Universal Account Numbers (UAN) will help the EPFO trace the owners of the inoperative accounts.
If an amount lying with companies, banks and mutual funds is unclaimed for more than seven years, it is transferred to Sebi's Investor Education and Protection Fund (IEPF). Investors can reclaim the amount by approaching either the fund house, the company or the registrar. Similarly , the RBI has established a Depositor Education and Awareness Fund (DEAF), where unclaimed deposits and bank balances of inoperative accounts flow in after waiting for 10 years.
One can claim this amount even after this transfer. If the accountholder furnishes identity proof, the bank will have to return the amount along with interest applicable.

European shares set to open lowerEuropean shares set to open lower

Tweet
London, Dec 1:  
European shares were seen falling at the open on Monday as weak Chinese economic data contributed to a rout in the commodities market and early indications pointed to disappointing sales at the start of the US holiday shopping season.
At 0609 GMT, futures for the Euro STOXX 50 equity index, Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC were between 0.6 per cent and 0.8 per cent lower.
Copper tumbles to 5-yr low
London copper tumbled to its lowest in four-and-a-half years and oil fell more than $2 a barrel to a five-year low after data showed China’s factories slowed more expected in November, casting a shadow over demand prospects at a time when the oil market already faces a supply glut.
Precious metals’ miners could also come under pressure after the yellow metal slid 2 per cent on Monday and silver slumped to its lowest since 2009. Swiss voters overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to boost central bank gold reserves, providing a new trigger for sell-offs in an already nervous market.
Thanksgiving week-end sales
Adding to a more subdued market tone after a two-week rise for major European indexes, the U.S. National Retail Federation estimated sales over the full Thanksgiving week-end would show a decline of 11.3 percent from a year earlier, to $50.9 billion.
Manufacturing data from the euro zone’s three largest economies, due between 0845 GMT and 0900 GMT, could also steer the market in early trade.
European Central Bank Executive Board member Sabine Lautenschlaeger had said on Saturday she saw little room for further easing of monetary policy despite a further fall in euro zone inflation.

After palliative care  waste management  Kerala CPI (M) to take up organic vegfarmingWritten by Shaju Philip |
Posted: December 1, 2014 1:23 pm | Updated: December 1, 2014 1:25 pm
After palliative care and urban waste management, CPI (M) in Kerala is planning to take up organic vegetable cultivation as its next arena of non-political intervention.
On Sunday, CPI (M) held a workshop in Alappuzha to take initiative for cultivating vegetables free from chemical pesticides. The party plans to replicate the successful farming model it had implemented at Kanjkuzhi village panchayat a decade ago. Around 300 party members from across the state attended the event.
CPI (M) state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan said the party would work out long-term and short-term strategies to popularize organic vegetable cultivation and make Kerala self-sufficient in vegetable cultivation.
He said the party would take the lead in people’s intervention in productive areas for the growth of the state. At the same time, party would not go back from its agitations against corruption and other political fights.
The three-day workshop discussed about various farming methods, including the precision farming, which is slowing picking up in Kerala. Self-groups and resident associations would be promoted to take up vegetable cultivation. The party fractions would work out plans to attain self-sufficiency in vegetable cultivation. Within a year, CPI (M) would also open vegetable marketing centres in various parts of Kerala.
CPI (M) is planning to cash in on the growing awareness in Kerala about the health hazards associated with use of pesticides in vegetable cultivation. At present, Kerala is depending upon neighbouring Tamil Nadu and Karnataka for its vegetable demand. Reports indicated that the vegetables reaching the markers had been exposed to heavy dose of highly toxic concoctions. Recently, households in urban and rural areas have been taking up vegetable cultivation for own consumption.

Shraddha Das: I developed so many blood clots after being hit byMannaraBy: BollywoodHungama.com | Mumbai |
Posted: December 1, 2014 1:23 pm | Updated: December 1, 2014 2:15 pm
‘Zid’ has released and now everything can be told as it happened. Shraddha Das, who wasn’t quite willing to brush things under the carpet was still reasonably restrained when she wanted to share the plight around what truly transpired between her and co-star Mannara during the making of the film.
However, now that the film is out and the physical bout between the two young women is there for all to see, Shraddha isn’t holding back her emotions while narrating the chain of events that led to her being as vocal as she is today.
For the uninitiated, Shraddha Das had accused Mannara of causing her injury during the shoot of ‘Zid’. Even though tidbits around the incident made headlines, we go deep down into the series of incidents and give a ‘blow by blow’ account. No pun intended. In an exclusive conversation, Shraddha bares her heart out and gives a first person account of what really happened.
“We had a lot of action scenes in the film between her and me. I play a positive character and she plays a negative character. Being a positive character, I confront her. While she beats me up, I defend myself. This was pretty much at the beginning of the first schedule itself. However, she started beating me up in real instead of faking it. It is a very long scene that carried off for two days as she would just keep beating me. I would keep telling her that ‘please be a little softer with me and don’t hit me’. She would acknowledge but then again come back to hit me.”
“This was a sequence that required her to hit me with a stick while I had to dodge. What is so important in such scenes is to maintain an eye contact to see the point where you are hitting the person. You have to fake it. I don’t know what happened to her but then she got a real stick from somewhere instead of using a dummy stick. She hit me on my right eye and that too with full force. I howled out of pain. Everything was blacked out for me. We had to stop shoot and I had to be taken to the hospital. Later I came back and shot with a swollen eye. There were so many blood clots that I developed.”
“It is not a publicity stunt. I cannot make up such a long story. If I had to indulge in that, I would have been in Mumbai giving interviews left, right and center. Instead I have been shooting for my other film. See, this is a story that needed to be told but then there was a time that had to be done. If I would have spoken about it earlier then the continued…

BJP  Shiv Sena close to clinching deal over power sharing inMaharashtraWritten by Shubhangi Khapre | Mumbai |
Posted: December 1, 2014 1:15 pm | Updated: December 2, 2014 2:33 pm
Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Monday said the talks between BJP and Shiv Sena are almost 80 per cent complete and moving in a right direction. The only point of dispute relates to what alternative the BJP is going to offer to Shiv Sena if it gives up its demand for ministry of home and deputy chief minister.
“At this moment I can state that we have completed 80 per cent discussions. Now, only 20 per cent discussions are left,” Fadnavis said. The chief minister exuded confidence that BJP and Shiv Sena will be able to work together in the government.
The Sena wants some heavy portfolio which can be a suitable replacement to ministry of home and deputy chief minister post. The BJP is also willing to consider Sena’s demand positively. On the platter it has already offered them ministry of public works department, ministry of water resources, ministry of agriculture and public works department.
The BJP is trying to get the Shiv Sena on board to provide an stable government in Maharashtra. The Shiv Sena is also under pressure to join the Fadnavis government. The BJP has already offered them ten to eleven ministerial berths including five to six cabinet rank.
Fadnavis also urged both BJP and Shiv Sena leaders not to make any statement out of turn that would affect the ongoing process. The chief minister said, “I would like to appeal leaders of both BJP and Sena not to make any statement. Only those leaders who are involved in the discussions should speak.”
Late Sunday night, leaders of Shiv Sena met Fadnavis at his official bungalow at Malabar Hills (Mumbai). Shiv Sena expressed their concerns and also emphasised they were keen on participating in the cabinet.
The chief minister indicated the cabinet expansion will take place this week. Fadnavis wants to carry out the cabinet expansion before the winter session of state legislature beginning at Nagpur from December 8.
The cabinet is likely to have 32 to 35 ministers. Currently there are only nine council of ministers lead by Fadnavis. The cabinet expansion will also have at least ten to 12 new BJP ministers.

Top 20 stocks that can return 39% | Oil below $68  OMCs a blind buyBrent
SINGAPORE: Oil fell more than $2 a barrel to a five-year low in Asian trade on Monday, extending a steep sell-off after OPEC decided not to cut production last week, keeping markets well supplied.
Both U.S. crude and Brent have fallen for five straight months, oil's longest losing streak since the 2008 financial crisis.
"Just when the market was thinking that a 4-year low for crude oil was bad enough, we have hit a 5-year low after the OPEC meeting," Phillip Futures analysts said in a note.
U.S. crude tumbled to near $64, dragging Brent down below $70, after Saudi Arabia's oil minister told fellow OPEC members last week that they must combat the U.S. shale oil boom.
"They (OPEC) can get by at $60 a barrel, but that price would knock out a fair whack of the competition - much U.S. shale oil for example - as well as put investment in future capacity growth firmly on the back-burner," ANZ analysts said in a note.
"They're playing the long game, banking that others can't."
Brent hit a low of $67.82 a barrel, the lowest since October 2009, and was down $1.71 at $68.44 a barrel by 0733 GMT. U.S. crude fell $1.49 to $64.66 a barrel, after earlier slipping to an intraday low of $64.10, the lowest since July 2009.
Oil-producing countries from Iraq to Nigeria are revising their 2015 budgets to reflect lower prices.
Iran refrained from protesting against OPEC's decision to retain its production ceiling to maintain group solidarity, even though the move will not benefit all members, Iranian oil minister said in local media reports.
Slower than expected growth in China's manufacturing sector may add further downward pressure on oil. China's official Purchasing Managers' Index ( PMI ) slipped to 50.3 in November, a government study showed on Monday, lower than analysts' forecasts of 50.6.
"It's not too bad a miss, but probably won't help (oil) too much," Ric Spooner, chief analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney said.
"It's best not to try to pick bottoms at this stage."
Spooner said the next support levels for Brent are at $68 and $64 a barrel. If West Texas Intermediate crude futures fall below $63.90 a barrel, the next support level would be at $50, he said.

Will see benefit of lower oil prices only in Q4: Gulf Oil

Post your opinion here
Halftime Report
Ravi Chawla, managing director,  Gulf Oil Lubricants says the steep fall in crude prices will aid the company’s profit and loss account only in January as it usually holds inventory for a period of two to two-and-a-half months.  
Chawla’s views come on the back of US crude falling to a five-year low while Brent futures touched a fresh four-year low, extending a steep sell-off after OPEC decided not to cut production last week, keeping markets well supplied.
Furthermore, on expansion plans, Chawla says the company is planning to enhance its capacity in Silvassa and has procured land for its second plant in Chennai.
“We expect the second plant to be functional by December 2016 and will raise part of the capital for it via debt and internal accruals,” he adds.
Below is the verbatim transcript of Ravi Chawla's interview with Latha Venkatesh & Sumaira Abidi on CNBC-TV18.
Sumaira: What kind of an impact are you seeing on account of the falling crude prices?
A: We have our major raw material which is base oil which is made from crude and if the prices are going to remain at the level they are or if it is going to go down further, there would be drop in terms of our raw material pricing.
Latha: Can you tell us where were the prices for base oil in the second quarter and where do you see them averaging at in the current and next quarter and when do you expect the benefits from crude oil price fall to start showing up in your profit and loss (P&L)?
A: The prices in Q2, we have seen that in the last one month they have come down by 15 percent but since we hold stock for about 60-70 days, we see that the impact of this will only come in the January quarter because all of us are currently holding stock of close to two-two-and-a-half month.
Sumaira: What is the outlook now for the lubricants business in India with crude prices falling but the economic conditions have also improved, so we are seeing some sort of recovery in commercial vehicle (CV) industry and sort of upswing in infra investments as well.
A: On the lubricant demand side we are seeing that the factory fill is going up but in terms of lubricant consumption we still have to see the positive in the commercial vehicle segment and hopefully with the mining and economy picking up, this should happen in the quarter starting January. Movement of trucks and tippers and mining equipment is essential for that to happen.
Latha: You once told us about second plant that will come on stream in Chennai in two years or so. Can you take us through what investments capex you have planned as well whether you will raise any debt for that?
A: We are planning to enhance our capacity in the current plant in Silvasa, which is on the way and will happen till January and we are also planning the second plant in the southern part near Chennai. This is going on stream we have got the land; we are looking at December of 2016. The investment in this will be around Rs 120 crore, part of it will be raised in terms of debt and part of it will be funded through our internal funds.
Latha: What is your current debt and what will it be after this capex is over?
A: We are currently completely debt free the only debt is against working capital. So, with the expansion in the Chennai project we are looking at about Rs 120 crore. The exact ratios of how much we will raise from internal and external still need to be worked out. However, there will be some debt which we will take on board for the Chennai plant.
Sumaira: Can you tell us how Q3 is panning out the kind of visibility you have and also what is your outlook now for the rest of the year?
A: We are seeing positive volume gain in the quarter two which is also due to the base effect of last year. So, that will continue in Q3 and if commercial vehicle (CV) segment demand lubricants in the after market which is related to the movement of basically trucks, drippers equipments if that is positive than again the volume growth would be at a better levels. That is what we are anticipating.

How Modi overturned BJP s opposition to India-B desh land dealHow Modi brought BJP around on India-Bangladesh land deal
BS Reporter | New Delhi Dec 02, 2014 12:46 AM IST
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, at Guwahati, on Sunday, attempted a tricky tightrope walk. He told Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers at a public meeting that the Land Boundary Agreement with Bangladesh, which the local Assam unit of the party had opposed in 2011, is beneficial for the country.
At the same time, he promised to address the problem of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants of the state.
Modi has tried to put national interest over the electoral interests of his party in not just Assam but also the neighbouring West Bengal. The assessment is that the BJP's commitment to address another emotive problem of Assam and Bengal, that of the illegal immigration from Bangladesh, will help the party overcome any political setback it might suffer because of pushing for the agreement.
Modi has tried to bring the BJP leadership in Assam on board on the issue, while the party is likely to "expose aggressively" the ruling Congress in Assam and Trinamool Congress in West Bengal "protecting infiltrators from Bangladesh". This balancing act is a key to the BJP for doing well in the Assembly elections in Assam and West Bengal, likely to be held in mid-2016.
The agreement, which requires Parliamentary ratification, was introduced in the Rajya Sabha as the 119th amendment in 2011, aims at exchange of enclaves between India and Bangladesh to resolve messy border issue. It was signed between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and counterpart Hasina in Dhaka in September 2011. The agreement was reached at after detailed surveys. India, as part of the agreement, would hand over control of 111 enclaves amounting to 17,160 acres and get from Bangladesh 57 enclaves across 7,110 acres. These enclaves are in Assam and Bengal.
It is this allegedly “unequal” exchange of territories that the Trinamool and Assam Gana Parishad made a political issue that forced the then government to postpone a vote on the Bill, which being a constitutional amendment requires a two-thirds majority in the two Houses of Parliament. The local units of the BJP in both Assam and Bengal were also opposed, although the central leadership of the BJP was non-committal on opposition to the Bill.
On Sunday, Modi indicated that his government is likely to push for the passage of the 119th amendment of the Constitution. Both AGP and Trinamool will try rake it up again as "surrender" of the interests of Assam and Bengal, and it will be up to the Modi-led BJP to counter this propaganda in the run-up to the 2016 Assembly elections in the two states.

AIDS campaigners say pandemic has finally reached tippingpointPrint

Posted: December 1, 2014 1:34 pm | Updated: December 1, 2014 1:37 pm
The world has finally reached “the beginning of the end” of the AIDS pandemic that has infected and killed millions in the past 30 years, according to a leading campaign group fighting HIV.
The number of people newly infected with HIV over the last year was lower than the number of HIV-positive people who joined those getting access to the medicines they need to take for life to keep AIDS at bay.
But in a report to mark World AIDS Day on Dec. 1, the ONE campaign, an advocacy group working to end poverty and preventable disease in Africa, warned that reaching this milestone did not mean the end of AIDS was around the corner.
“We’ve passed the tipping point in the AIDS fight at the global level, but not all countries are there yet, and the gains made can easily stall or unravel,” said Erin Hohlfelder, ONE’s director of global health policy.
The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS is spread via blood, semen and breast milk. There is no cure for the infection, but AIDS can be kept at bay for many years with cocktails of antiretroviral drugs.
United Nations data show that in 2013, 35 million people were living with HIV, 2.1 million people were newly infected with the virus and some 1.5 million people died of AIDS. By far the greatest part of the HIV/AIDS burden is in sub-Saharan Africa.
The AIDS pandemic began more than 30 years ago and has killed up to 40 million people worldwide.
The United Nations AIDS agency, UNAIDS, says that, by June 2014, some 13.6 million people globally had access to AIDS drugs, a dramatic improvement on the 5 million who were getting treatment in 2010.
“Despite the good news, we should not take a victory lap yet,” said Hohlfelder.
She highlighted several threats to current progress, including a $3 billion shortfall in the funds needed each year to control HIV around the world.
“We want to see bold new funding from a more diversified base, including more from African domestic budgets,” she said.
ONE also noted that HIV is increasingly concentrated among hard-to-reach populations such as injecting drug users, gay men and sex workers – groups who are often stigmatised and have trouble accessing treatment and prevention services.

Sebi permits 123 alternative funds to operate in IndiaSebi permits 123 alternative funds to operate in India
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Dec 01, 2014 01:27 PM IST
Market regulator Sebi has allowed as many as 123 entities to set up AIFs -- newly created class of pooled-in investment vehicles for real estate, private equity and hedge funds -- in less than two and half-years.
The 123 Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) have been registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) since July 2012.
Of these, around 34 entities got the market regulator's approval to operate so far this year (January-November), 67 in 2013 and the remaining 22 in 2011.
The AIFs that have registered with Sebi in November are Religare Dynamic Trust, Indus Way Emerging Market Fund and Carpediem Capital Partners Fund.
Singular India Opportunities Trust was registered in October.
The regulator had notified in May 2012, the guidelines for this new class of market intermediaries. AIFs are basically funds established or incorporated in India for the purpose of pooling in capital from Indian and foreign investors for investing as per a pre-decided policy.
Under Sebi guidelines, AIFs can operate broadly in three categories. The Sebi rules apply to all AIFs, including those operating as private equity funds, real estate funds and hedge funds, among others.
The Category-I AIFs are those funds that get incentives from the government, Sebi or other regulators and include Social Venture Funds, Infrastructure Funds, Venture Capital Funds and SME Funds.
The Category-III, AIFs are those trading with a view to making short-term returns and it includes hedge funds, among others.
The Category-II AIFs can invest anywhere in any combination but are prohibited from raising debt, except for meeting their day-to-day operational requirements. These AIFs include private equity funds, debt funds or fund of funds, as also all others falling outside the ambit of above two other categories.

Nifty Retreats From Record High, Hovers Near 8,600
NDTV | Updated On: December 01, 2014 13:24 (IST)
Oil Slumps Near $59 for First Time Since 2009 on Oversupply
NSE Nifty retreated from record highs today on some selling pressure in metal, oil & gas and capital goods stocks. The Nifty rose nearly 35 points to hit a record high of 8,623 today in early trade as oil prices tumbled to a five-year low. Some caution also set in ahead of RBI policy review scheduled for tomorrow, traders said.
Oil-users were among the top gainers today. Jet Airways surged nearly 6 per cent, while Asian Paints traded 5 per cent higher. Apollo Tyres rose nearly 3 per cent and state-run oil marketing company Hindustan Petroleum Corp jumped over 2 per cent. The fall in crude oil will boost operating margins for users and increase discretionary spends in the economy, analysts say.
"We believe there is still room for the downstream crude players or those that use crude as a raw material to move north, be it paints, tyres, OMCs or lubricant companies," said Jyotheesh Kumar, executive vice-president of HDFC Securities.
Markets also got a boost after the government scrapped a rule mandating traders to export 20 per cent of all gold imported into the country.
Friday's move to ease gold imports sent jewellery stocks sharply higher today. Titan, India's biggest gold company surged over 6.5 per cent, while Rajesh Exports traded with over 3 per cent gains.
Banking shares also traded higher ahead of crucial Reserve Bank policy announcement tomorrow. Traders have pinned their hopes on a rate cut, but most economists say the central bank will hold rates. Lenders such as Axis Bank and PNB rose over 1 per cent.
Shares in Maruti Suzuki and TVS Motor jumped on Monday after the automakers reported better-than-estimated sales numbers for the month of November.
Maruti Suzuki gained over 2 per cent to a day high of Rs 3,414.75, while shares in TVS Motor surged over 4 per cent to a day high of Rs 239.50.
India has been the best-performing emerging market this year on the back of record buying by foreign investors. On Friday, FIIs bought shares worth Rs 936 crore. They have invested over $40 billion in debt and equities this calendar year.
The rupee was trading at 62.15 vs Friday's close of 62.02. The Indian currency hit a low of 62.25 earlier, a level last seen on February 20.
Among top Nifty losers, Sesa Sterlite, Jindal Steel and Power, NMDC, BHEL and ONGC were down over 2 per cent.

General Motors India today reported a 33.1 per cent decline in sales at 4,157 units in November as against 6,214 units in the same month last year.
During the month, the company exported 150 units to Chile, marking its maiden vehicle shipment to that country. Commenting on the sales performance, General Motors India Vice President P Balendran said: "Even though the lower fuel prices are encouraging, the interest rates remain sticky and inflation continues to be high."
The outlook remains grim and it is very unlikely that passenger cars will post positive growth this fiscal keeping in view the present economic conditions, he added.
"Discounts are at their peak and sales of diesel vehicles are tapering off as the price differential between the two fuels is dropping sharply.Going by the market scenario, we expect the challenging times to continue till some major announcements take place in the budget to improve customer sentiments," Balendran said.

Maintain 20% revenue guidance for FY15: V-GuardTarget to achieve 8.5-9 percent operational margins this fiscal
Mithun Chittilappilly
ED
V Guard Industries
V-Guard Industries  has been in the spotlight with the stock gaining around 133 percent this year – from a low of Rs 403 it touched a high of Rs 1140 in November.
In an interview to CNBC-TV18, Mithun Chittilappilly, MD of V-Guard Industries, said though there has been an improvement in consumer sentiment, footfall is yet to pick up. Among regions, Andhra has seen a substantial improvement in demand, he said, adding that company will stick to its 20 percent revenue growth guidance for FY15.
According to Chittilappilly, the second quarter typically remains for the company, but the second half of the fiscal contributes 55 percent of the overall business. He feels a fall in reduction in crude price should reduce freight costs and expects to achieve 8.5-9 percent operational margins this fiscal. The fourth quarter is generally the strongest quarter for the company and a revival in southern markets will reflect in results going forward, he added.
Below is the transcript of Mithun Chittilappilly’s interview with Latha Venkatesh and Sumaira Abidi on CNBC-TV18.
Latha: Give us an idea of how things are panning out in the Q3, you have almost seen two thirds of it, was it anything as good as your Q2 numbers indicated? 
A: I am not going to make any number-specific comment but all I can say is that we are going as per our projections. We had talked about 20 percent growth before the financial year started and that is definitely achievable. This is (20 percent growth) for the full financial year. We had targeted about Rs 1800 crore for the full financial year and we are on track to achieve that. We have done slightly better in the first six months, so, about 22-23 percent growth in the first six months. 
As far as the actual demand on the ground is concerned we have not seen a big change in sentiments. Customer footfalls are what it was earlier so it is not like there has been a huge improvement in demand side. However, since we are expanding in newer geographies we are small player in many of those geographies. We are getting some sale so we may do better than our peers in that extent. 
We are expecting things to substantially improve maybe starting off next financial year because the construction demand has not still picked up. So, hopefully in next financial year we should see that also coming into play.
Sumaira: This 20 percent revenue growth guidance that you had given us wouldn’t you now look at scaling it up a little bit and also the last time around you had mentioned that margins for you have now sort of bottomed out at 8.5 percent. So, how much headroom do you think you have in FY15 itself to scale it up?
A: As far as the revenue guidance is concerned like I said earlier we will be more comfortable as we complete more number of months and as we go towards the end of the year. Why I said that is we could always have some seasonal fluctuations, we could have a very late onset of summer which will impact sales in March and so on and so forth. So, these kind of things could happen. 
There is a huge improvement in the mood and all that in the market but when we speak to channel partners in trade what we understand is customer footfalls etc have still not improved from what it was earlier. One definite improvement what we have seen is in Andhra Pradesh because last couple of years has been extremely bad. So, Andhra Pradesh there has been a substantial improvement in demand and sales also. 
However, other places it is the same situation what it was earlier. What it essentially means is as a company we are more cautious while supplying to our partners because many of our retail partners are also dealing with real estate companies and supplying with government projects, etc and so on and so forth. So, many of our partners are in fact stressed to that extent. Our business is not linked to that but they are not only selling our products, they are selling our competitors product, other related products and they are selling into all types of customers, retail as well as projects.
In that sense, as a company we are very cautious on how we do business in this kind of environment because cash flow rotation for them has been a challenge for last two-three years. So, that is why I am saying that we are still sticking to our 20 percent growth which is achievable. If we feel the need to up our guidance we will definitely do that but as of now I am still holding on to that. 
Latha: As a rule your second half is better, isn’t it? 
A: As a rule we do better in the second half than in the first half because our Q4 is very strong and our second quarter is usually the weakest the quarter. 
Latha: Normally what is the split for a full year between first half and second half? 
A: I think it is maybe 55-56 percent of the sales come from second half and 45 percent from the first half. That is kind of the split.
Latha: What is the improvement in margins that you are expecting if any because of general fall in raw material prices? 
A: We have seen some reduction in basic prices but that reduction has started to happen maybe about one month back. I think we still have some inventory in the pipeline of our distributors and maybe we will see some of that flowing in as we go forward in the Q4. 
The positive things are reduction in crude should ideally result in some reduction of freight cost. Freight cost for company like us is about 2.5-3 percent of sales per annum. So, there could be some reduction in freight cost. 
There will be some reduction in the cost of plastic which is used in cabinets which is directly linked to crude prices. So, these are some of the reductions we are expecting to see. 
Latha: You will do better than 8.3 percent operating profit margins (OPMs)?
A: We have said that we will do between 8.5-9 percent, somewhere in between. So, that is the kind of guidance we have given. However, this is also depending on several other factors like product mix, geographical mix, etc but we should be able to do 8.5 percent EBITDA margin definitely. 
We will have to see how much of this we are actually going to realise in our bottomline because they take time to flow in. We will also have to see some competitor activities. There could be some of our peers sitting with etc inventory who may pass on some of these to the market and so on and so forth. 
We will have to watch out for all this but some of these benefits should flow because I am not expecting many of the brands to have any reduction in prices of their products anytime soon.
Sumaira: Your Southern market has seen a bit of revival this time around. It was muted for four quarters before that. Is that sustainable, the kind of growth that you have posted over there and also for this none Southern market. So, you are sharpening your focus over there. How much do you think those markets could scale up to?
A: The South market revival has been led by Andhra Pradesh. We are growing extremely well there. We had a lot of positive impact of bifurcation of states playing out. Last about three years we have not seen much growth in Andhra Pradesh, now it is Telangana and Andhra, so now both the regions are growing extremely well. So, that has been a very positive impact. 
As far as the other South states are concerned we have to be mindful that we are very large player, our revenues on an average will be about Rs 300-400 crore in each of the other three states. So, we have very high market shares in many of our product categories. So, any slowdown in the market also affects us. 
Revival in South for the entire market will come when there is a revival in the economy. So, when construction activity picks up in India we should start seeing some good growth in south as well apart from this growth that we are getting in Andhra Pradesh.
Latha: Why would a bifurcation of the state lead to people buying more geysers or water heaters? Is it that the construction activity has picked up in Andhra? 
A: What has happened in the earlier unified Andhra and now the two states is that for the last two and half to three years, the market has been completely disturbed. There were at least seven to eight bandhs or hadtals in a month. The average working day of any market in those two states has been 10-15 days for the last two years. So, what has happened is last two years there was a complete subdued demand, two years there was no growth in fact there was de-growth happening for almost two years. 
Suddenly when things had clarity and when the states became separated there is a lot of pent up demand that is happening. So, it is not that more number of people are buying geysers, it is just that people who have not bought anything for the last two years have started doing.

Those targets are not worth mentioning. But I sincerely hope they come someday, but this day dreams are not worth looking at or considering. As some boarders have said there is nothing to hope for till Q4. Till that time day dreams and fantasies and also very big talk. No one with self respect will do that normally. But then this is a free board.

Dear pranavbehal:
TATGLOBAL has gone from 19/09/2014 H172.90 to 17/10/14 L150.80 i.e. 1 month. Such movements of a drop or otherwise of about 13% were 1 year phenomenon in 2004/2005.
So many things are happening too fast for both roameri and pranavbehal.
As for the Capital Gains angle remember that not the price but only the gain is deducted by 15%. Therefore if you wait for a year after a share has reached your target you may get a price of 15% less.
Anyways we are both long on TATAGLOBAL because is  TATAs and `the cup that cheers`

Jewellery stocks shineJewellery stocks shine on relaxed import restrictions
BL Research Bureau
December 1, 2014:  
Markets may be lethargic but jewellery stocks are on fire.
The biggest gainers in this pack feature Gitanjali Gems and Shree Ganesh Jewellery House, up 20 per cent, TBZ which is up 15 per cent, Tara Jewellers and Thangamayil Jewellery, up around 9 per cent in trade so far. Further down the gainers list at 5-7 per cent are Titan Company, PC Jewellers, Tara Jewellers and Rajesh Exports.
What is spurring these stocks is the Reserve Bank scrapping the 20:80 gold imports rule last Friday, having partially relaxed it earlier this year. This, together with easing of gold-on-lease model, also earlier this year, means a better raw material availability for jewellery companies.
Domestic players
The 20:80 gold import rule, which was put in place last July, required nominated banks and agencies to export at least 20 per cent of their gold imports. This was to clamp down on imports to curb the current account deficit. These measures raised domestic gold premiums, pressuring jewellers’ margins besides tightening raw material supply.
The complete relaxation in this rule is good news, especially for domestic jewellers who do not have a high export component such as Titan Company, Thangamayil, PC Jewellers and TBZ. Shrinking domestic gold premiums can prop up margins. The eased import rules jives well with international gold prices trending steadily lower. Finally, quite apart from a cheaper and easier input scenario, consumer demand may also receive a shot in the arm with lower gold prices.

Domestic airline capacity to rise 10%  says CAPA studyDomestic airline capacity to rise 10%, says CAPA study
BS Reporter | Mumbai Dec 01, 2014 01:36 PM IST
Driven by a rebound in passenger growth and low fuel prices airlines are expected to add 26 planes in domestic market, according to a Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA) report.
"Domestic capacity is projected to grow by 8-10% in FY2015 and will largely be driven by IndiGo and start-up carriers. IndiGo is expected to deploy six A320s in the domestic market between April 2014 and March 2015. AirAsia India, which launched with one Airbus A320 in Jun-2014, is likely to reach a fleet size of five to six aircraft by Mar-2015. Vistara may have about five aircraft in operation by the end of FY2015. However, the final number of aircraft may vary as Air Asia India's plans are subject to change, while Vistara's growth is dependent on the timing of its launch,'' CAPA said in its report.
Domestic air traffic grew by over 18% in October compared to same month boosted by festive season travel demand. Indian carriers flew over 5.9 million passengers last month up 5 million in last October.
CAPA expects domestic traffic to grow 6% and international traffic to rise 10% in FY 2015. Jet Airways will add international capacity 10-12% with most of the growth coming from connecting Abu Dhabi with other Indian cities. Plans to launch daily service to Chicago and New York via Abu Dhabi have been put on hold till the US-Federal Aviation Administration upgrades India's safety ranking.
Air India's international expansion has primarily been in Europe. Last year it launched Birmingham and this year it has added Milan, Rome and Moscow to its network, with Amsterdam, Munich, Madrid and Barcelona expected in the coming months, CAPA has said.

Bitcoin Exchange Kraken to Help in Mt Gox Bankruptcy
Reuters | Updated On: November 26, 2014 16:25 (IST)
Motherson Sumi's German Acquisition to Be EPS Accretive
Tokyo: US bitcoin exchange operator Payward Inc on Wednesday said it will work on retrieving some millions of dollars lost by Tokyo-based Mt Gox, once the world's largest bitcoin exchange before it collapsed in bankruptcy this year.
Kraken, Payward's bitcoin exchange, will assist Mt Gox's Tokyo-court appointed trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi with investigating where the missing bitcoins are, along with eventually redistributing any found to creditors as part of liquidation.
The partnership between Payward and Mt Gox was approved by the Tokyo district court on Wednesday. Kraken will not be paid for the arrangement but could win new clients as former account holders at Mt Gox register to receive future distributions from the liquidation.
"We hope to revive bitcoin's reputation and create a healthy market for it, ultimately leading to profit for us," Ayako Miyaguchi, managing director of Kraken's Japanese operations, told reporters.
Once handling 80 per cent of the world's bitcoin trades, Mt Gox filed for bankruptcy in February in Tokyo after it lost 750,000 of its users' bitcoins and 100,000 of its own. Mark Karpeles, the 28 year-old French CEO of Mt Gox, blamed hackers for the loss.
The lost funds represented the equivalent of $480 million at the time of the bankruptcy filing. Mt Gox also said $28 million were "missing" from its Japanese bank accounts.
Karpeles later said he had recovered 200,000 of the lost bitcoins.
The collapse of Mt Gox was a setback for a five-year-old virtual currency that proponents see as a still-developing alternative to traditional money.
Kraken, a San Francisco-based bitcoin exchange, announced in October that it was launching trading between bitcoin and the yen, saying it was the only major exchange to offer a dedicated bitcoin/yen order book.

Here Are The Most Googled Toys In Each Statereddit
The must-have holiday gift this year isn't a cutting edge robot or even the latest video game console, it's a Rubik's cube. Well, it is if you live in Colorado, anyway.
A new map made by SumoCoupon , a website that offers discounts at various stores, reveals the gifts that are most popular in each state this holiday season. SumoCoupon came up with the map by analyzing Google search volumes to see which item people were Googling the most in each state. They determined which toys to include using "curated lists of classic and more modern popular toys and games," the company wrote The Huffington Post in an email.
Some of the hottest presents this year had us a little surprised. Everybody knows toys from Disney's "Frozen" are bound to be a hit this year. But it looks like there's still plenty of competition from American classics like baseball gloves and Barbies. Check out which holiday toy is trending in your state.

Delhi-based Zomato Sets Foot in IrelandMotherson Sumi's German Acquisition to Be EPS Accretive
Zomato on Wednesday said it has expanded its footprint to Dublin, Ireland. With its entry into Dublin, the number of countries Zomato has presence in goes up to 19.
The Delhi-based online restaurant guide recently raised $60 million (over Rs 365 crore) from Vy Capital and existing investors Info Edge (India) Ltd and Sequoia Capital to fund global expansion and new product development.
Zomato provides detailed information including menus, photos, contacts and user ratings for over 3,00,000 restaurants. It is present in countries like UK, UAE, Canada, Brazil, Turkey, Indonesia, New Zealand, Philippines, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Qatar, Chile, Portugal, and Lebanon.

Samsung still on top while Lava  Karboon fight for third spot: IDCBy: Tech Desk |
Posted: November 27, 2014 6:50 pm
India continued to be the fastest growing smartphone market in Asia Pacific with a quarter-on-quarter growth of 27% in Q3 2014 (July – September), with no major changes in the top five vendors. Even as Samsung and Micromax held on to their one and two positions, there seems to be a tough fight for the number 3 slot between Lava and Karbonn, both of which has an 8 per cent market share, said a report from  International Data Corporation (IDC).
The market observed exceptional growth owing to festive demand and recorded a new high in smartphone shipments in Q3 2014. As a result the overall mobile phone market stood at 72.5 million units in Q3 2014, a 15% quarter-on-quarter growth and a 9% year-on-year growth, IDC said.
“With 6% contribution in the overall smartphone market, phablets are observed to be hitting a plateau. On the other hand smartphone with screen size between 4.5 inches and  5.5inches are seen as the sweet spot for consumer preference. Consumer need higher screen size phone to enjoy media content and with the 4G rollout expected in CY2015, we expect the phablets segment to pick up again,” said Kiran Kumar, Research Manager, Client Devices IDC India.
Among smartphone vendors Samsung continued as the market leader with 24% market share though at a lower growth rate compared to the industry average. Micromax increased its market share from 18% in Q2 2014 to 20% in Q3 2014. Lava has witnessed growth in both ‘Lava’ and ‘Xolo’ brands, currently treated as independent lines of business. Karbonn too had an 8% market shared with 85% of shipment volume supported by handsets priced less than $100. Motorola held on to its fifth spot thanks to the fresh line up of 2nd generation handset.
In the overall Mobile phone market, Q3 2014 has been one of the quarters where feature phone shipments recorded double digit quarter on quarter growth of 10%. However, contribution of feature phone in Q3 2014 compared with the same period of CY2013 shows a de-growth of 9% as large number of users continue to migrate to Smartphones, said the IDC report.

Maruti Alto 800 Tops Quality Among Entry Level Cars: StudyMotherson Sumi's German Acquisition to Be EPS Accretive
New Delhi: Maruti's entry level model Alto 800 ranks highest in the entry compact segment for initial quality, while rival Hyundai's i10 gets the top slot in the compact segment, said a study today.
According to JD Power 2014 India Initial Quality Study rankings, Maruti Suzuki Alto 800 ranks highest in the entry compact segment with 97 problems per 100 vehicles (PP100), while the company's Swift ranks highest in the premium compact segment with 78 PP100.
In the compact segment, Hyundai i10 ranks highest with 84 PP100, and the Hyundai Xcent ranks highest in entry midsize segment with 86 PP100.
Besides, Honda Brio ranks highest in the upper compact segment, the Ford Ecosport in SUV segment, the Skoda Rapid in the midsize segment and and the Toyota Innova in the MUV/ MPV segment.
The 2014 India Initial Quality Study (IQS) is based on evaluations from 8,429 vehicle owners who purchased a new vehicle between November 2013 and July 2014.
The study includes 73 vehicle models from 17 makes. The study was fielded from May 2014 to September 2014 in 30 cities across India.
All problems are summarised as the number of problems per 100 vehicles (PP100). Lower PP100 scores indicate a lower rate of problem incidence and higher initial quality.
According to the study, diesel powered vehicles have become better in terms of quality in India as the number of problems new-vehicle owners are reporting with their diesel vehicles have decreased significantly.
Diesel vehicle sales in India have increased by 16 per cent in 2014, compared with 2010, while initial quality has improved as the number of problems with diesel vehicles have decreased to 96 problems per 100 vehicles (PP100) in 2014 from 148 PP100 in 2010, it added.
"Overall, the industry has made significant strides on improving the quality of diesel vehicles, especially on core vehicle systems," JD Power Asia Pacific, Singapore executive director Mohit Arora said.
However, with the development of public transportation in India, coupled with an increase in carpooling, owners are driving fewer kilometers, helping to reduce the number of overall problems with diesel vehicles, he added.
The study, now in its 18th year, measured problems owners experience with their new vehicle during the first two to six months of ownership and examines more than 200 problem symptoms covering eight vehicle categories.
The categories covered in the study being: engine and transmission; vehicle exterior; driving experience; HVAC; features, controls and displays; vehicle interior; seats; and audio, entertainment and navigation.

Analyst Corner: Buy IndusInd Bank on retail bizscale-upSpiceJet shares continue to plunge; down 17 pct
IndusInd is among our top picks in sector with a target price of R880 based on 3.6x Sep-16 adjusted PB. The bank has raised return on assets (ROA) from lows of 0.3% to 1.8% led by improving deposit franchise, higher cross-sells and lower credit costs. Over FY4-17, we expect it to deliver 26% CAGR in profits led by strengthening of deposit franchise, an uptick in CV-cycle  and wider product suite.
The management highlighted that new product launches have been the key to its growth in retail as well SME segments. While new loan products will help to reduce dependence on auto loans from 37% now, new payment platforms will help to win market share in float deposits and fees across retail, corporate and government clients.
The management plans to focus on targeted geographies, where the bank will target a 5% share. They believe a higher share in key markets will help to strengthen the brand, attain critical size of customers and dominate pricing. It is interesting to note that even Wells Fargo has also identified such a ‘sweet-spots’ between market share in branches and customers that optimises profitability of branches.
We believe digital platforms will drive 20% of bank profits by FY20. IndusInd has launched services like video-branch, ‘my-account-my-number’ and choice of denomination at ATMs to strengthen the brand. It will leverage social/ online platforms and invest in Big-Data analytics to identify customer needs to customise products; management is also open to collaborations and acquisitions in these areas.

The Best Gift Doesn t Come in a Box. It s the BoxThe best gift doesn’t come in a box, it is the box
Nicole Dieker TODAY contributor

J.M. Guyon / CTK
After tracking down the perfect toy only to see the kid abandon it to play with the box instead, what parent hasn’t thought: Why didn’t we just give them the boxes instead?
If you have, you’re not alone. One in seven parents report their kids played longer with Christmas present packaging than the toys inside, according to the 2012 Ribena Plus Play Report.
The cardboard box is such a popular children’s toy that it was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame in 2005. Generations of children have turned cardboard boxes into dollhouses, spaceships, puppet stages, robot bodies, and more.
Also, kids love anything that's part of the adult world that they can transform themselves, said Asia Citro, a parent and author of “150+ Screen Free Activities For Kids.”  Many of the ideas in her book involve recycling everyday materials into toys. “They get to play with something that isn’t necessarily set out for them,” said Citro.
Video: Sarah Lazarovic joins TODAY to talk about why she swore off clothes and shoes for 365 days, and the lessons she learned, which she details in her new book, “A Bunch of Pretty Things I Did Not Buy.”
That way, kids get to use their creativity and feel proud of the thing they made.
When Citro and her preschool-aged daughter made Halloween butterfly wings out of cardboard, her daughter not only loved painting the wings but also telling people that she had created the costume.
“She was in preschool and she said, ‘I made these,'” said Citro.
But cardboard boxes aren’t just for preschoolers. In 2011, filmmaker Nirvan Mullick discovered a 9-year-old boy who had made a working arcade out of cardboard boxes in his dad’s garage in East Los Angeles. Mullick arranged for a surprise flash mob  of hundreds to show up and spend an afternoon playing Caine’s games.
The documentary for Caine's Arcade.
“I think there’s something about a cardboard box that captures kids’ imaginations,” Mullick said. “You can build anything out of it and turn it into anything. It’s way more exciting than whatever came in the box.”
Caine Monroy agrees. “I imagine what I want to build and I build it,” he said.
Caine was able to build his cardboard arcade because he had three magic ingredients: materials, space, and time.
So perhaps, child experts say, instead of wrapping up the Nerf N-Strike Elite Demolisher 2-in-1 Blaster or the $349 Razor Crazy Kart, try wrapping up a big cardboard box filled with markers, safety scissors, ribbons, stickers, and other supplies. 
Or have Santa give kids a stack of cardboard and a book of kid-friendly crafts to inspire them.
Then, follow Mullick’s advice to give your children not only the freedom to play with their cardboard boxes, but also the space in which to explore and make messes.
“[Parents] used to make their kids clean up or not leave a mess,” said Mullick. But after watching Mullick’s 10-minute documentary Caine’s Arcade, he said, “they decided to just let them go a little bit and have some space to be a kid and be creative.”

Will In-Store Pick-Up of Online Sales Pay Off for RetailersCourt Refuses to Let Off Hindalco in Coal Block Case
Chicago: Brick-and-mortar merchants are seeking an edge over Amazon.com Inc and other e-tailers this holiday season by encouraging customers to pick up online orders at their local store. But the tactic could raise costs - and create problems managing inventory, retail analysts and consultants said.
The increased emphasis on store pick-up comes in response to last year's debacle, when millions of holiday packages were left stranded after a late surge of express-delivery orders overwhelmed retailers.
Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Target Corp, Best Buy Co Inc and Lowe's Cos Inc and other merchants are combining in-store pickup with lower online prices to draw shoppers to their stores. The hope? Customers will make additional purchases.
But the shift is forcing chains to carry a wider array of products and could overwhelm inventory management systems. Also: many stores might not have storage for all the extra goods.
"Most retailers are still trying to figure out where is the right place to position this additional inventory...a lot of them aren't quite prepared," said Michael DuVall, a supply chain consultant for Strategy&, formerly Booz & Co.
Rising costs?
A supply chain consultant who works with Wal-Mart, and spoke on condition of anonymity, said the retailer's inventory costs are growing because Wal-Mart is stocking additional merchandise so it can fulfill online orders being picked up at stores.
"They are having a hard time keeping that (stock) consistent with what they need," the consultant said.
A Wal-Mart spokeswoman, in response to the consultant, said the company has inventory and processes in place for the holiday season.
Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly acknowledged inventory management is a challenge. "Stores that boost inventory to meet just the in-store pickup demand face a risk of being stuck with excess," Joly told Reuters. Still, he added, the chain has a lot of experience with in-store pickups. Forty percent of Best Buy's online revenue already comes from orders picked up in the store.
Some retailers, meanwhile, are establishing special distribution centers called "dark warehouses," partly because traditional storage facilities can't handle the small daily quantities associated with store pickup. Dark warehouses, so-named because they are almost always unmanned, cater to five to 25 stores at once. Truck drivers drop off and stock the merchandise; stores send small teams to collect the goods.
A retailer might spend $1 million to set up a 100,000-square-foot dark warehouse, DuVall said, but that would still be less costly than storing the additional inventory.
Promoting purchases
In-store delivery is proving popular with customers. A survey by consumer insights firm Parago showed 64 percent of consumers who placed online orders have selected in-store pickup over delivery this year - that compares with less than 4 per cent a year ago.
Jerry Manning, a 37-year-old office assistant in Chicago, said he chose in-store pickup for this year after holiday merchandise from Costco arrived late in 2013.
"I'm not going to wait for them to show up when I can pick it up in a few hours," he said.
Some retailers are seeking to leverage in-store visits by offering gift cards to pick-up customers. But such discounts could reduce profitability, analysts warn.
"They are making money but they are also giving away margin they don't have to," said Eileen Kolev, of retail analytics firm Microstrategy.
Retail analysts figure a one percent price cut can reduce a product's operating profit by as much as 11 per cent.
Lowe's CEO Robert Niblock said the company tracks gift-card promotions, including those connected to in-store pickup, to measure whether increased sales justify the discounting.
"The cost of having a promotion for store pickup or in general must bring us an adequate benefit, and we track that very closely," Niblock said.
Consultants and analysts expect any incremental sales increase to remain small, as consumer spending remains under pressure.
The endless sale
Retailers that use gift cards and other promotions as perquisites for in-store pickup may find they need to dole out such promotions during future holiday seasons, too.
"It's similar to the way Black Friday started and now customers only want better offers, and all that deep discounting is only hurting the industry," said Anjee Solanki, national director of retail services with Colliers International.

No Green Nod Needed for 74 Coal Blocks to be Auctioned in FebruaryNew Delhi: The 74 coal mines, which the government plans to auction to specific end-users in the first phase of bidding on February 11, will not require any green clearances, a top official has said.
The auction will be for the private sector, while state-owned companies will get mines via allotment.
The 74 blocks to be auctioned are from 204 mines whose allocations were quashed terming their allotment as "arbitrary and illegal" by the Supreme Court.
"In these 74 blocks, the clearances that have been given in the past shall pass on to the new allotees. The Ministry of Environment and Forests is working out a formulation. But in principle they have agreed that there would not be any requirement for fresh clearances," Coal Secretary Anil Swarup told PTI an interview.
"Land acquisition is not an issue for these blocks, nor environment clearances," he added.
The government had last week announced auctioning and allotment of 74 blocks - 42 blocks, which are already into production and another 32 which are ready for production - in the first phase of bidding.
These blocks have potential to produce 210 million tonnes of coal.
Asked about the remaining 130 mines, Mr Swarup said the focus as of now is on the blocks, which were already producing or ready for production, and the matters related to the remaining blocks would be taken up later as "there are many other things to be done. So there is no urgency in that".
To a question when the government intends to allow commercial mining, Mr Swarup said, "The government is first considering these 74 coal blocks. Thereafter, a view will be taken on whether or when or how commercial mining will happen."
The government had also announced that it is considering auctioning or allotting more than 74 blocks in the first phase as it wants enough number of coal mines available to power firms.
It is in the process of finalising the exact number of additional mines on the basis of the nature of the blocks.
The government had already made it clear that the number of mines a company can bid will be capped to avoid monopoly.
The e-auction of coal blocks will have a two-stage tender process of technical and financial bids.

Planning Commission Replacement Likely in December
Press Trust of India | Updated On: November 30, 2014 20:19 (IST)
BofA-ML Sees 0.25% Rate Cut in February on Easing Inflation
New Delhi: Work has moved into top gear for finalising the name and structure for the new institution that will replace the 64 year old Planning Commission and the same may be unveiled this December.
"The Prime Minister has convened a meeting of the Chief Ministers on December 7 to seek their view points on the structure of the institution which would ultimately replace the Planning Commission," an official source said.
The commission has received many suggestions regarding the name and role of the new body. Some of the suggested names are 'Sustainable Development Commission', 'National Development Agency', 'Social Economic Development Commission' and 'Bharat Pragati Lakshya'. Besides, there have been reports about the new body being named as 'Niti Aayog' or 'Policy Commission'.
The new institution, which is likely to be headed by the Prime Minister as was the case in Planning Commission, may have four divisions - an inter-state council, a plan evaluation office, Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) and UIDAI. All the divisions would have experts from the central and state governments as well as experts from the industry.
The Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) mission earlier was part the Planning Commission but was moved to the Finance Ministry later.
According to sources, the new body could also be the secretariat for the inter-state council which is at present under the Home Ministry and met rarely during the UPA term.
This council used to meet regularly during the previous NDA regime.
PM Narendra Modi in his Independence Day speech had announced that the commission would be abolished and replaced with a more relevant institution.
Since then, the commission has held several meetings with experts to discuss the new structure of the proposed institution.
India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had set up the Planning Commission to steer the country's economic destiny at that time.
Set up by a Cabinet resolution, the commission has enjoyed power and prestige with Prime Minister as its Chairman. Its most important functions have been fixing targets for sectoral growth and allocate resources.
The Deputy Chairman of the commission has often been a political stalwart holding the rank of a Cabinet Minister.
Gulzarilal Nanda, V T Krishnamachari, C Subramaniam, P N Haksar, Manmohan Singh, Pranab Mukherjee, K C Pant, Jaswant Singh, Madhu Dandavate, Mohan Dharia and R K Hegde have been at the position of Deputy Chairman at different points of time. Montek Singh Ahluwalia was the last Deputy Chairman of the planning body.

PM Narendra Modi slips to second spot in TIME s  Person of the Year  pollEnforcement Directorate probing beneficiary of Rs 425 crore Indian Premier League facilitation fee
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has slipped to the second place in the Time magazine’s ‘Person of the Year’ poll with the Ferguson protesters surging ahead of him in a vote by the readers.
As per latest reports, Modi is leading second with 9.8 per cent of the total votes polled so far while the Ferguson protesters are leading with 10.8 per cent of the votes.
Joshua Wong, face of the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement, is placed third.
Nobel Peace prize winner Malala Yousafzai (5.3 per cent) and Russian President Vladimir Putin are placed fourth and fifth respectively.
US President Barack Obama is placed at a distant 11th position with just 2.4 per cent of the total votes.
The annual poll, which is currently underway, is scheduled to end on December 6 and the poll’s winner will be announced on December 8.
However, it is the TIME’s editors who will choose the Person of the Year, which is scheduled to be announced on December 10.
Till November 26, Modi was leading the polls with 11.1 per cent of the total votes while Ferguson protesters with 8.8 per cent were ranked second.
But support for Ferguson protesters surged after a recent grand jury’s decision of not to indict a white police officer who fatally shot an unarmed black man which caused an outcry across the United States.
“Ferguson protesters surged ahead this week of the leader of the world’s largest democracy,” Time magazine said yesterday in a story titled ‘Modi Drops From Lead in TIME’s Person of the Year Poll.’
“Modi, the newly elected Indian prime minister and leader of the largest democracy in the world, has raised high hopes among Indians that he can invigorate the country’s economy and cut bureaucratic red tape that has slowed development in India,” the magazine said.

Career Q and A -- Career Coach0
The challenge is that all career coaches are not created equal. The vast majority I've encountered are glorified human resources people. They are linear thinkers and don't have the creativity or resourcefulness to help career changers in particular, because career changers, by definition, don't have experience in the field they're hoping to enter.
Q. When choosing a job coach, what should someone look for?
A. The best way to find a career coach is by word-of-mouth. Ask everyone you know whether they know anyone who's ever worked with a coach. Once you find someone, take time to interview that person. Be sure to get answers to the following questions:
-- How much does the coach charge?
-- How long has the coach been doing this?
-- What is the income range of the coach's clients?
-- Does the coach have a particular area of expertise in specific jobs or industries?
-- Are there any clients the coach hasn't been able to help?
-- Does the coach take on all clients or is he or she selective?
Most importantly, make sure you're comfortable with the person. After all, you'll be working together. The process actually can be fun (so) enjoy it as much as possible.
Q. How much money should you expect to spend on a job coach?
A. Ideally, you, the job hunter, should be able to look back and think, "That was a terrific investment." At the same time, the career coach should be able to say, "I was fairly paid for my services." To achieve this win-win scenario, be open to the possibility of a value-based fee. However, most (coaches) still charge hourly fees ranging from $75 to $500 per hour. Whatever you do, avoid companies that charge exorbitant fees upfront. More than a few times, I've heard about people who paid $10,000 or more with the "guarantee" that they'd find a job. Unfortunately, not one of these people had anything to show for it.
Assess your return on investment. Think carefully about the cost of not having a job. How much money are you losing every month you're unemployed? Spending a few hundred dollars per hour may seem expensive, but if you can invest that money and get a job weeks or months earlier than you would have without the coach, the investment will pay for itself many times over. Besides, in many places, the expense is tax-deductible.
Q. What's your advice for those hesitant to use a job coach?
A. Job hunting requires strategy and creativity. Even if you're creative by nature, it's helpful to have an outside perspective.
Q. Is a job coach a good idea for a recent graduate?
A. It might be a bit more of a stretch financially for people right out of school, but it can still be a terrific investment. For example, I worked with one recent grad who was a cashier at Barnes & Noble. He came to me for help because he finally got an interview and wasn't confident in his abilities. After completing a mock interview on a Friday afternoon, it was clear we needed to overhaul his approach. Almost four hours later, he emerged with a solid plan, as well as a number of compelling stories.
The following Monday, he called me after the interview to say the recruiter spontaneously told him what a great job he'd done and recommended he speak with the CEO. Two days later, he had an entry-level position in IT with the company.

Carmakers Want Excise Duty Relief to StayYou are here: Home Industries
Auto Industry Pitches for Continuation of Excise Duty Relief
Press Trust of India | Updated On: November 30, 2014 15:50 (IST)
Court Refuses to Let Off Hindalco in Coal Block Case
New Delhi: Carmakers have asked the government to extend relief on excise duty that ends on December 31, saying removal of this incentive could push the industry into a negative territory.
The government had cut excise duty on cars, SUVs and two-wheelers in the Interim Budget in February to help the industry tide over a demand slump.
In June, the new government extended the excise duty concession for automobiles by six months to December 31.
"I had welcomed the government's move when they had announced to maintain the reduction in excise duty six month's back and I think the government should continue to do so going forward as well," Renault India country CEO and managing director Sumit Sawhney told PTI.
Maruti Suzuki chairman R C Bhargava said, "At this point, if the excise duty goes up, it could easily push the car industry into the negative territory."
He expressed the hope that government will continue excise relief and said it is very conscious of the need to expand manufacturing and that the car industry has not been performing as good as it was hoped for.
Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) director general Vishnu Mathur said the continuation of the excise duty relief would help the industry recover fully.
"We are requesting the government to continue the excise duty reduction as the industry has not fully recovered. Continuation of excise duty relief will help the recovery of the industry," he said.
Car sales in India fell 2.55 per cent in October as purchases remained subdued during the festival season, marking the second consecutive month of decline. In September, car sales had declined 1.03 per cent, after posting four months of consecutive growth.
Excise duty on small cars, scooters, motorcycles and commercial vehicles currently stands at 8 per cent from 12 per cent previously. The factory gate duty on SUVs stands at the reduced rate of 24 per cent as against 30 per cent.
The duty on large cars stands at 24 per cent compared with 27 per cent earlier, while the duty on mid-sized cars stands at 20 per cent from 24 per cent.
Mr Sawhney said that the government should take a long-term view and look at further reducing the excise duty.
"Taking a long term view the government has to have a unified excise duty structure and look forward to a further reduction in the excise duty, which is a long pending demand from all the manufacturers," he said.

United Spirits Minority Shareholders Reject 9 Proposals
Press Trust of India | Updated On: November 30, 2014 21:06 (IST)
Motherson Sumi's German Acquisition to Be EPS Accretive
New Delhi: Minority shareholders of United Spirits Ltd, India's largest liquor firm, have rejected as many as 9 of 12 resolutions, including some pertaining to pacts with entities connected to erstwhile promoter Vijay Mallya.
Separately, it also informed bourses that the licensing proposal for manufacturing and distribution of Diageo's bottled-in-India (bulk) products in the country, on which USL had sought approval through a postal ballot, had failed to go through.
Shareholders at the November 28 EGM rejected approval to a loan agreement dated July 3, 2013 between United Spirits Ltd (USL) and United Breweries (Holdings) Ltd.
They also did not approve pacts dated September 30, 2011 and December 22, 2011 between USL and UBHL that required UBHL to sell to the firm certain immovable properties, according to a BSE filing.
Other resolutions that were defeated with requisite majority include approval of a services agreement dated July 3 2013 between USL and Kingfisher Finvest India, approval of a sponsorship pact dated June 11 2013 between USL and United Racing & Bloodstock Breeders, approval of a sponsorship pact between USL and United Mohun Bagan Football Team Pvt Ltd.
Some resolutions had to get shareholders' nod with new norms on related-party transactions coming to effect.
The three resolutions that were passed related to erosion of net-worth of the company, sales promotion agreement and trademark licence pact, according to the BSE filing.
With 127 shareholders attending the EGM and participating in polling, this could suggest institutional shareholders played an active role in rejecting some resolutions.
USL's BSE filing said according to regulations, promoters were prohibited from voting on the resolutions. These included, Relay BV, which owns 54.78 per cent, United Breweries Holdings, Kingfisher Finvest India among others.
However, five of the promoters group entities - UB Holdings, Kingfisher Finvest India, Devi Investments, Rossi and Associates and Vittal Investments - exercised their votes in favour of a couple of resolutions at EGM. The scrutinizer invalidated the votes exercised by them.
The company said it will examine the validity of the votes exercised by these entities.
USL is now controlled by world's largest spirits maker Diageo, which had acquired additional 26 per cent shares in USL for Rs 11,448.91 crore in July with an aim to take its total stake in the Indian firm to 54.78 per cent.
Liquor baron Vijay Mallya has been recently re-elected as non-executive director and chairman of United Spirits.

Attacking Didi BJP president Amit Shah at a massive gathering in Kolkata on Sunday. - ASHOKE CHAKRABARTY
Opposing Centre is stalling projects in State, says Amit Shah
Kolkata, Nov 30:  
The BJP on Sunday made a strong pitch for removal of the Trinamool Congress in the Assembly elections in West Bengal, scheduled in 2016.
Addressing a rally to mark Uthhan Dibas (Day of Rising), party president Amit Shah said Mamata Banerjee’s three-and-a-half-year rule in the State has caused irreparable damage.
“Today Bengal is at a historic juncture. It voted to power the TMC looking for development. But it has not been the case. Bengal has only gone backwards,” he said.
Reckless opposition of the Centre’s policies by the State government has only stalled development projects here, he added. Pointing out that the people of Bengal need a strong leadership, Shah urged them to support the BJP.
“In 2016, we want to form the government in Bengal. We may win in Maharashtra or Haryana; but our real victory will be when we win elections here. The countdown marking the end of Trinamool has begun,” he said.
The immediate focus though, he said, will be to win the upcoming polls for the Kolkata Municipal Corporation, due in May 2015. “Kolkata will herald the change for the end of the Trinamool,” he added.
Questioning the role of the State government in the Saradha chit fund scam, the BJP president asked why Mamata is shielding the accused.
“TMC MPs have been protesting against black money in Parliament, is the Saradha money black or white? She alleges that her party leaders are being framed by CBI. Let her say on record that those arrested are innocent,” he said.
Further questioning the State government’s decision to wind up the Shyamal Sen Commission, Shah said the move makes it clear that Mamata is not interested in refunding the depositors money.
Shah also alleged that the Mamata government, in the name of vote-bank politics, was shielding terrorists. He accused the Trinamool leadership of being involved in the Burdwan blast.
Saradha’s money, according to Shah, is being diverted in such activities. “Saradha;s money was used in this blast, CBI is investigating this matter,” he alleged, accusing Mamata of protecting illegal immigrants.

Nine out of 12 resolutions rejected at United Spirits’ EGM
Bengaluru, November 30:  
The integration of United Spirits Ltd (USL) with its new owner Diageo suffered a major setback, with the minority shareholders defeating most of the special resolutions at the extraordinary general meeting here on Friday.
Significantly, by a postal ballot, the shareholders rejected the agreement for manufacture and distribution of Diageo brands in India by USL. A total of nine resolutions connected with entities related to USL Chairman Vijay Mallya were defeated. Only three resolutions got the shareholders’ nod. A USL spokesperson said that the company will look into the reasons for the shareholders taking exception to some of the resolutions. The company will take a decision on holding another meeting soon.
Only 127 public shareholders participated in the voting, which suggests that institutions had a major role to play in defeating the majority of the resolutions.
In a filing to the exchanges, USL said the key resolution regarding approval of loan agreement between USL and UB Holdings has not been approved by the shareholders.
Another resolution regarding sale of immovable properties to USL by UB Holdings also did not find favour with the shareholders. The filing also pointed out that as per the regulation, the promoters were prohibited from voting on the resolutions. These included Relay BV which owns 54.78 per cent of the share capital of the company, United Breweries Holdings, Kingfisher Finvest India and others who hold 4.09 per cent. However, five of the promoters of the company, UB Holdings, Kingfisher Finvest India, Devi Investments, Rossi and Associates and Vittal Investments exercised their votes in favour of the resolutions at item no 2 and item no 11.
The filing said that the scrutiniser has invalidated the votes by these entities. It also said that the company will investigate the validity of the votes exercised by these entities.

Wintry mix likely Tuesday morning  slick conditions possibleBy Jason Samenow November 30 Follow @capitalweather
GFS model simulates a wintry mix at 7 a.m. Tuesday morning over the D.C. metro region.  The freezing line, in red, is shown across central Loudoun County extending north along the Montgomery-Frederick County line. (WeatherBell.com)
After two straight mild afternoons, an Arctic front seeps edges into the region Monday night.  Cold air  bleeds southward, setting the state for a wintry mix of precipitation by Tuesday morning.
Like last Wednesday’s setup in the region, temperatures will probably be just marginally cold enough  to support frozen precipitation in the immediate D.C. area.  So, while we may see some sleet and/or wet snowflakes, any accumulation or build-up on roads is a long shot.  Temperatures will probably remain at or slightly above freezing.  Having said that,  pay attention to forecasts as a slight shift to the colder side could mean a higher impact situation.
Unlike last Wednesday’s storm, a strong area of high pressure will be poised to the north, acting as a source of refrigerated air.
European model shows strong high pressure poised over eastern Canada Tuesday morning, serving as a source of cold air into the region. (WeatherBell.com)
In our colder suburbs north and west of the Beltway, temperatures are more likely to be a little below freezing – which may allow for a slippery mix of freezing rain, sleet, and/or snow.  Precipitation amounts won’t be heavy, but just a little ice and snow could cause commuting issues during the morning rush.
In short, the same areas that received accumulating snow last Wednesday are the same areas that are most likely to experience delays and slick travel Tuesday morning.
By late Tuesday morning or early Tuesday afternoon, the cold front retreats to the north as a warm front, allowing most areas to rise safely above freezing, ending the winter weather threat.  But it will remain a cold, raw day, with temperatures holding below 40 in most spots.
We’ll provide additional details and analysis on Monday.

Gold Tumbles After Swiss Referendum  Oil Hits 5-Year LowOil Slumps Near $59 for First Time Since 2009 on Oversupply
Tokyo: Gold prices tumbled on Monday after Swiss voters overwhelmingly rejected proposals to boost gold reserves in a referendum, joining a broad rout in commodities that sent copper and oil prices to four- and five-year lows.
The slide in the oil and commodity prices is hurting many assets tied to the resource sector - from Australian mining shares to the Malaysian ringgit.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.9 per cent, hitting six-week lows.
US stock futures also slipped 0.4 per cent, though some market players think the fall could stem partly from disappointing sales at the start of the US holiday shopping season last Friday.
European stocks are expected to fall, with Germany's DAX and France's CAC40 seen shedding 0.6 per cent.
Gold fell more than two percent at one point to $1,142.90 per ounce, its lowest level in more than three weeks, while silver was also hit, falling more than six percent to a five-year low below $14.50 per ounce.
The Swiss gold reserves proposal, had it been approved, would have compelled the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to more than double its gold reserves and banned it from ever selling the metal, threatening its ability to defend a 1.20 euro cap on the Swiss franc imposed at the height of the euro zone crisis.
The Swiss franc dipped to 1.2042 on the euro from 1.2018 at the end of last week, though the Swiss currency is supported by investors who still regard it as one of the safest currencies in the world. It last stood at 1.2040.
"The result should of course temporarily relieve the pressure on the SNB's currency floor, albeit whilst doing little or nothing in our opinion to reverse the fundamental downward trajectory of EUR/CHF," said JPMorgan analyst Paul Meggyesi.
Oil prices hit five-year lows, unable to find a bottom despite their biggest fall in 2 1/2 years last week after OPEC held back from cutting output in the face of a supply glut.
US crude briefly fell more than three percent to a five-year low of $64.10 per barrel, with the fall from June exceeding 40 per cent. It last stood at $64.56, down 2.4 per cent.
Adding fuel to the fire, Saudi Arabia's oil minister told fellow OPEC members last week that they must combat the U.S. shale oil boom.
"They (OPEC) can get by at $60 a barrel, but that price would knock out a fair whack of the competition - much of US shale oil for example - as well as put investment in future capacity growth firmly on the back-burner," ANZ analysts said in a note. "They're playing the long game, banking that others can't."
Copper also fell to as low as $6,230.75, piercing through its March low to hit its lowest levels since mid-2010. It last stood at $6,245.50, down 1.7 per cent.
The Australian dollar fell more than one percent to a four-year low of $0.8417 as did the Malaysian ringgit, which fell to 3.437 to the dollar.
Adding salt to commodities' wounds, Chinese official manufacturing data suggested growth is slowing in China, demand from which has supported commodity prices for years.
Sliding oil and raw material prices have stirred deflation fears in the euro zone and Japan, cementing expectations that the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan will take more steps to support their respective economies.
The dollar, taking advantage of such concerns, attracted bids against the euro and yen.
The euro was slightly weaker at $1.2449 after having fallen on Friday on news that annual inflation in the euro zone cooled to a five-year low of 0.3 per cent in November.
Many traders expect the ECB may signal further action later this week to ward off deflation.
The dollar also hit a seven-year high of 119.03 yen and the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, rose to 88.451, a four-year high.
"Given that the Fed is going to raise rates next year, the monetary policy divergence should support the dollar," said Osao Iizuka, the head of FX trading at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank.
The yen's fall and lower commodity prices helped Japanese shares, with the Nikkei posting 0.8 percent gains to close at seven-year high.

 Oil in Longest Losing Streak Since 2008 CrisisOil Slumps Near $59 for First Time Since 2009 on Oversupply
Singapore: Oil fell more than $2 a barrel to a five-year low in Asian trade on Monday, extending a steep sell-off after OPEC decided not to cut production last week, keeping markets well supplied.
Both US crude and Brent have fallen for five straight months, oil's longest losing streak since the 2008 financial crisis.
"Just when the market was thinking that a 4-year low for crude oil was bad enough, we have hit a 5-year low after the OPEC meeting," Phillip Futures analysts said in a note.
US crude tumbled to near $64, dragging Brent down below $70, after Saudi Arabia's oil minister told fellow OPEC members last week that they must combat the US shale oil boom.
"They (OPEC) can get by at $60 a barrel, but that price would knock out a fair whack of the competition - much US shale oil for example - as well as put investment in future capacity growth firmly on the back-burner," ANZ analysts said in a note.
"They're playing the long game, banking that others can't."
Brent hit a low of $67.82 a barrel, the lowest since October 2009, and was down $1.71 at $68.44 a barrel by 0733 GMT. US crude fell $1.49 to $64.66 a barrel, after earlier slipping to an intraday low of $64.10, the lowest since July 2009.
Oil-producing countries from Iraq to Nigeria are revising their 2015 budgets to reflect lower prices.
Iran refrained from protesting against OPEC's decision to retain its production ceiling to maintain group solidarity, even though the move will not benefit all members, Iranian oil minister said in local media reports.
Slower than expected growth in China's manufacturing sector may add further downward pressure on oil. China's official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) slipped to 50.3 in November, a government study showed on Monday, lower than analysts' forecasts of 50.6.
"It's not too bad a miss, but probably won't help (oil) too much," Ric Spooner, chief analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney said.
"It's best not to try to pick bottoms at this stage."
Spooner said the next support levels for Brent are at $68 and $64 a barrel. If West Texas Intermediate crude futures fall below $63.90 a barrel, the next support level would be at $50, he said.

Gold tumbles after Swiss referendumGold tumbles after Swiss referendum; oil hits 5-year low

Tokyo, Dec 1:  
Gold prices tumbled on Monday after Swiss voters overwhelmingly rejected the proposals to boost gold reserves in a referendum, joining the broad rout in commodities that sent oil prices to five-year lows and copper to four-year lows.
Sinking oil and commodity prices are causing massive realignments in markets, hurting assets tied to the resource sector, from Australian mining shares to the Malaysian ringgit, while benefiting importers such as Japan and China.
Swiss says "NO" to #gold ... @ $1148 now Charts turn ugly..$1000-$950 next???

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.0 per cent, with resource-heavy Australian shares hitting a six-week low.
Gold fell more than two per cent at one point to $1,142.90 per ounce, its lowest level in more than three weeks, while silver also took a hit, falling more than six per cent to a five-year low below $14.50 per ounce.
Swiss gold reserves
The Swiss measure, had it been approved, would have compelled the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to more than double its gold reserves and banned it from ever selling the metal, threatening its ability to defend a €1.20 euro on the Swiss franc imposed at the height of the euro zone crisis.
The Swiss franc dipped to 1.2042 on the euro from 1.2018 at the end of last week, though the Swiss currency is supported by investors who still regard it as one of the safest currencies in the world. It last stood at 1.2036.
“The result should of course temporarily relieve the pressure on the SNB’s currency floor, albeit whilst doing little or nothing in our opinion to reverse the fundamental downward trajectory of EUR/CHF,’’ said JPMorgan analyst Paul Meggyesi.
Oil at 5-year low
Oil prices hit five-year lows, unable to find a bottom despite their biggest fall in 2 1/2 years last week after OPEC held back from cutting output in the face of a supply glut.
US crude fell more than two per cent to a five-year low of $64.10 per barrel, with the fall from June exceeding 40 per cent.
Copper also fell to as low as $6,230.75, piercing below its March low to hit its lowest levels since mid-2010.
The Australian dollar fell more than one per cent to a four-year low, of $0.8417, and so did the Malaysian ringgit, which fell to 3.424 to the dollar.
Chinese manufacturing data
Adding salt to commodities’ wounds, Chinese official manufacturing data suggested growth is slowing in China, demand from which has supported commodity prices for years.
Deflation fears
Sliding oil and raw material prices have stirred deflation fears in the euro zone and Japan, cementing expectations that the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan will take more steps to support their respective economies.
The dollar, taking advantage of such concerns, attracted bids against the euro and yen.
The euro was slightly weaker at $1.2437 after having fallen on Friday on data showing annual inflation in the euro zone cooled to five-year lows of 0.3 per cent in November.
ECB stimulus measures
Many traders expect the ECB may signal further action later this week to ward off deflation.
The dollar also hit a seven-year high of 119.03 yen and the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, rose to 88.451, a four-year high.
“Given that the Fed is going to raise rates next year, the monetary policy divergence should support the dollar,’’ said Osao Iizuka, head of FX trading at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank.
The yen’s fall and lower commodity prices helped Japanese shares, with the Nikkei rising to seven-year highs. Mainland Chinese shares also gained, with Shanghai Composite Index hitting a three-year high.

Crude oil prices hit multi-year lowsCrude oil prices hit multi-year lows as OPEC decision weighs
PTI
Tweet
Singapore, Dec 1:  
Crude oil prices fell further in Asia today to new multi-year lows, continuing a steep selloff sparked by OPEC’s decision to maintain crude output in an oversupplied market.
US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for January delivery dipped USD 1.55 in early Asian trading to USD 64.60, its lowest intraday level since July 2009.
Brent crude for January sank USD 1.84 to USD 68.31, below the psychologically important USD 70 level.
“Negative actions in the oil market are continuing today.
Investors see crude as remaining vulnerable after last week’s OPEC announcement,” Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, told AFP.
“We have not yet seen any piece of news or development that could trigger a bottoming out phase in oil prices,” he added.
The unabated price plunge comes after the 12-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) opted November 27 to maintain its collective output ceiling at 30 million barrels per day, where it has stood for three years.
OPEC refused to cut production despite a glut of supplies that has sent prices tumbling by more than a third since June, with analysts warning of further falls to come.
The news dragged WTI down USD 7.54 in New York on Friday, compared with the settlement price on Wednesday, to end at USD 66.15 a barrel. US floor trading was closed Thursday for a holiday.
Brent meanwhile had settled at USD 70.15 on Friday, down USD 2.43 from Thursday’s close. It had earlier touched USD 67.90, its lowest intraday price since February 2010.

ISIS not fighting a holy war: Areeb Majeed tells National Investigation AgencyMalala Yousafzai: 'Heartbroken' about attack in Pakistan
Areeb Majeed, suspected member of terror outfit Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), has revealed the names of the local contacts, who allegedly provided him the logistics to join the group to take part in the battle in Iraq, National Investigation Agency (NIA) officials said.
Majeed also disclosed how he was completely sidelined by the terror group as he had been asked to carry out menial tasks like cleaning toilets or providing water to those on the battlefield, instead of being pushed into the warzone.
“Majeed was grilled for several hours when he revealed the names of the local contacts, who radicalized him and his three other friends here, and helped them fly to Iraq. We are verifying his claims and are trying to locate these local contacts,” a National Investigation Agency official said.
However, the officer refused to divulge the names of the local supporters here saying it would derail the probe.
Asked for how many months he participated in the battle on the ground, the 23-year-old ISIS ‘recruit’ said he was completely ignored and asked to clean the toilets and arrange water for those battling with the security forces.
He told the investigators that despite his immediate supervisor’s request, the ISIS cadres did not allow him to participate in the battle.
His resolve to take part in the war weakened after he was left unattended for his bullet injury for three days before being taken to a hospital, he told them.
“Only after I begged them, I was taken to a hospital. I was treating myself, but the injury was worsening as there was no proper medication or food available in the camps,” Majeed told investigators.
“There was neither a holy war nor any of the preachings in the holy book were followed. ISIS fighters raped many a woman there,” Majeed said while responding to one of the questions, an National Investigation Agency (NIA) official said.
Admitting that he and his three friends from Kalyan underwent training on handling of sophisticated AK 47 and rocket launchers, Majeed claimed the Indians were considered to be physically weak.
Majeed was arrested on Friday on his return to Mumbai after spending nearly six months in Iraq. He was booked under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) on charges of conspiring to commit a terrorist act and being a member of a banned foreign terror outfit, and under the stringent Section 125 of the IPC for “waging war against the nation”.
In May this year, four youths from Kalyan town — Majeed, Shaheen Tanki, Fahad Shaikh and Aman Tandel — had left India to visit holy places in West Asia, but disappeared thereafter. They were suspected to have joined the ISIS.
According to police, the four engineering students flew to Baghdad on May 23 as part of a group of 22 pilgrims to visit religious shrines in Iraq.
The next day, Majeed had called his family from Baghdad and apologised for having left without informing them. Upon returning to India, other pilgrims had told the police that, Majeed, Fahad, Aman and Saheen had hired a taxi to Fallujah, a city west of Baghdad, which had emerged as the epicentre of Iraq’s deadly insurgency.
On August 26, Tanki called up Majeed’s family and told them that their son had become a “martyr” claiming that the latter died fighting for ISIS in Syria.
Accordingly, the next day, Areeb Majeed’s family performed ‘Janaza-e-gayabana’ (prayers for the departed soul in the absence of the body) in Kalyan.

HSBC China manufacturing PMI falls to 50.0 in NovChina’s manufacturing PMI falls to six-month low of 50.0 in Nov: HSBC
Reuters
Tweet
Beijing, Dec 1:  
Growth in Chinese factories stalled in November as output shrank for the first time in six months, reinforcing expectations that authorities will roll out more aggressive stimulus measures after unexpectedly cutting interest rates to shore up growth.
The final HSBC/Markit China Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) edged down to 50.0 in November, a six-month low and right on the boom-bust level that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
The reading was unchanged from a preliminary “flash’’ finding and down from a final 50.4 in October.
Output fell to 49.6, the worst reading since May, as companies scaled back production in the face of “muted growth in new work’’ and subdued market conditions, HSBC/Markit said on Monday.
Economic growth
Hurt by a sagging property market, unsteady export growth and cooling domestic demand and investment, China’s economic growth is expected to slow to a 24-year low of 7.4 per cent this year, though the fourth quarter is shaping up to be possibly weaker than earlier thought.
After months of sticking to more modest stimulus measures, China surprised global financial markets by cutting interest rates on November 21 to spur activity and help bring down the financing costs for cash-starved companies which are struggling to pay off mountains of debt.

Japans Nikkei share average rose to a fresh seven-year highNikkei rises to fresh 7-year high on capex data
Reuters
Tweet
Tokyo, Dec 1:  
Japan’s Nikkei share average rose to a fresh seven-year high on Monday as strong corporate spending lifted the sentiment, with airline shares extending gains as oil prices tumbled further.
Exporters were also in demand after the dollar rose to a new seven-year high against the yen.
The Nikkei rose 0.9 per cent to 17,615.14 points by mid-morning after climbing as high as 17,649.02, the highest since July 2007.
Capital spending
The 5.5 per cent year-on-year rise in capital expenditure over the third quarter reported on Monday is expected to ease concerns about a recovery from a sales tax increase earlier this year.
Such machinery shares benefited from the strong capital spending figures, with Fanuc Corp rising 1.9 per cent and Keyence Corp jumping 2.3 per cent.
Falling crude oil prices continued to help ANA Holdings Inc, which soared 5.3 per cent to 307.6 yen, the highest since February 2011.
Japan Airlines Co climbed 7.2 per cent to 3,740 yen, the highest since the airline spilt its stock on October 1. Tire makers Bridgestone Corp rose 1.1 per cent and Yokohama Rubber Co surged 2.1 per cent.
“Falling crude prices is serving as a tailwind to a developed country like Japan,’’ said Norihiro Fujito, a senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities, adding that the drop in prices would help consumption as well.
“It’s a Thanksgiving gift to the Japanese market,’’ he said.
Crude oil at multi-year lows
US crude fell more than $2 to a five-year low in Asian trade, while Brent futures touched a fresh four-year low. Also lifting risk sentiment was the weak yen after the dollar hit 119.02 on the EBS trading platform, the highest since August 2007.
Toyota Motor Corp rose 1.6 per cent and Honda Motor Co advanced 1.1 per cent. Bucking the strength was Sumitomo Metal Mining Co, which fell 1.8 per cent as gold prices slid 2 per cent after Swiss voters overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to boost central bank gold reserves.
The broader Topix rose 1.1 per cent to 1,425.39, and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 gained 1.0 per cent to 12,966.49.

Phillip Hughes to be 63 not out foreverDe Gea stars in Manchester United's sixth successive win
Phillip Hughes will forever be 63 not out after Cricket Australia (CA) adjusted the scorecard of his final match as a mark of respect for the promising cricketer who lost his life following a freak injury on the field.
“It might seem like a little thing, but it’s an important distinction. Phillip will forever remain 63 not out,” said CA chief James Sutherland.
Hughes was hit by a bouncer from Sean Abbot during a domestic match earlier in the week. He was to turn 26 yesterday.
Australian captain Michael Clarke took to Twitter to share his feelings on the death of his “little brother”, a day after paying a moving tribute to the left-handed batsman.
“Life will never be the same. Happy bday bro. Will love you forever. It has been the hardest few days of my life,” was one of Clarke’s many posts remembering Hughes’ birthday.
Australia one-day opener Aaron Finch too wished his former teammate.
“Happy birthday brother! With us forever!! Just a standard day, walking around the house in your baggy green! Haha,” he wrote.
Fast bowler Peter Siddle said: “I’m going to miss your cheeky smile, but I’ll never forget it”.
Hughes’ South Australian teammate Chadd Sayers wrote “Happy birthday little man! Miss you so much already!”

AAP promises VAT rationalisation; party nets 50LMalala Yousafzai: 'Heartbroken' about attack in Pakistan
Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal promised to rationalise the Value Added Tax (VAT) in Delhi, if his party came to power.  At a fundraising lunch organised the party’s traders wing at the national capital here, AAP collected Rs 50 lakh.
Addressing traders, Kejriwal promised to rationalise VAT on products, which were higher in states, especially neighbouring ones, saying this will help consumers and traders, both of whom were unhappy with the arbitrary manner it was currently calculated without a proper rationale and proposed to initiate online payment of taxes.
The party collected Rs 50 lakh from the event, while a similar event held in Mumbai last Thursday fetched Rs 91 lakh, taking the total to Rs 1.41 crore in just two such events.
Entry fee for the event was Rs 20,000.
AAP plans to hold similar high-cost meals in the national capital and Bangalore, and attempts are being made to hold one in Kolkata.
The party has set a target of Rs 30 crore for the Assembly elections.
Outlining the party’s vision for traders of Delhi, Kejriwal said his party wanted to make the national capital a trading powerhouse by creating a traders friendly environment.
“AAP will abolish raids by VAT department inspectors which are carried in the name of sudden visits. Tax collection from traders cannot be coercive, since it is counter-productive and leads to more tax evasion. Traders have to be encouraged to pay taxes on time by providing incentives and the AAP government will abolish all coercive measures currently used against traders,” he said.
Kejriwal added that his party will give priority to revive the wholesale business in Delhi and will make all possible efforts to turn the national capital into a retail hub.
The party will soon unveil its plan to encourage the wholesale distributive character of the national capital.

Hero plans to set up mfg plants in Brazil  ArgentinaHero MotoCorp plans to set up manufacturing plants in Brazil, Argentina
Roopshree Nair     Bogota (Colombia)   Last Updated: December 1, 2014  | 10:49 IST
Eyeing aggressive expansion in Central and Latin America, India's largest two-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp plans to set up manufacturing units in Brazil and Argentina, even as it expects upcoming plant in Colombia to help widen its reach in the region.
"We believe that the factory in Colombia will be a good hub for supply to other markets for us in Central and Latin America," Hero Moto Corp MD & CEO Pawan Munjal told PTI.
"We will get into manufacturing in Brazil. Argentina also requires us to manufacture locally, which is also on the cards. We would like to enter the Brazilian market along with the Rio Olympics in 2016," he added.
Hero MotoCorp launched six of its best-selling bikes here as part of its target to clock 1.2 million unit sales from global business by 2020.
The two-wheelers rolled out include the 100 cc bikes - Splendor iSmart, Eco Deluxe, and Passion-Pro; the 125 cc Glamour; the 150 cc Hunk and the 225 cc Karizma ZMR. The bikes will be sold in 120 outlets spread across the country.
This July, the company formed a wholly owned subsidiary in Colombia and commenced construction of a state-of-the-art manufacturing plant in the country.
The project entails investment of $70 million in capital expenditure as well as working capital over a three-year period, he added.
"In the first phase we are going for manufacturing 75,000 to 80,000 units in annual capacity, going up to 1,50,000 units in next phase," Munjal said on the upcoming unit in Colombia.
With this, the New Delhi-headquartered Hero MotoCorp will be the first Indian two-wheeler company to have a manufacturing plant in Latin America. The plant in Colombia is expected to go on stream by the middle of 2015.
Munjal said the company is looking to establish manufacturing and assembly units in 50 countries worldwide as part of its global expansion plans.
By 2020, the company aims to be in over 50 countries with 20 plus assembly facilities globally.

Mumbai, Dec 1:  
The rupee erased its earlier losses during the day to end almost flat at 62.02 to the dollar against Friday’s close of 62.03 due to the American dollar's gains against other currencies overseas.
Rupee under pressure ahead of monetary policy, below 62 again. The $24 bn of FPI money that moved in to debt this year is at stake here.

In intra-day trade, the domestic unit touched a high of 62.25 and a low of 62.02. According to market watchers, dealers avoided taking long positions ahead of the Reserve Bank of India’s bi-monthly monetary policy review tomorrow.
Bond yields slip to 8.03%
Yield on the benchmark 10-year bond hit 8.03 per cent, the lowest level since August 2013, on continued fall in global crude prices. Brent crude prices were near four-year lows after oil producers’ club OPEC decided to not cut oil output. Harihar Krishnamoorthy, treasurer at FirstRandBank, said, “The market believes that the OPEC’s decision to not cutback production will last for some time.” According to NS Venkatesh, Executive Director (Treasury & International Banking), IDBI Bank, the market has been showing irrational exuberance and if the RBI does not cut rates in the policy announcement scheduled tomorrow, it may lead to hardening of bond yields to 8.15 per cent levels.

Oct oil shale permits drop: Is the slowdown ...Allen Gilmer
(Permits for new wells dropped…)
NEW YORK: US oil producers have been racing full-speed ahead to drill new shale wells in recent years, even in the face of lower oil prices. But new data suggests that the much-anticipated slowdown in shale country may have finally arrived.
Permits for new wells dropped 15 per cent across 12 major shale formations last month, according to exclusive information provided to Reuters by DrillingInfo, an industry data firm, offering the first sign of a slowdown in a drilling frenzy that has seen permits double since last November.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries last week agreed to maintain its production quota of 30 million-barrels-per-day, despite a 30 per cent drop in oil prices since June, triggering an additional 10 per cent decline. That move, many analysts believe, was squarely aimed at US oil producers driving the country's energy resurgence: can they continue drilling at the current pace if prices don't rise?
"Currently, the market is focused on US shale as the place where spending and production must be curtailed," Roger Read, a Wells Fargo analyst, said in a note Friday. "There is little doubt, in our view, that lower oil and gas prices will result in lower spending and lower shale production in 2015 to 2017."
A cutback of US production could play into the hands of Saudi Arabia , which has suggested over the past few months that it is comfortable with much lower oil prices.
Most analysts predict US oil producers can maintain their healthy production rates in the first half of 2015 - thanks in part to investments made months ago.
Some oil service companies have suggested that a slowdown might be held off, as they continue to buy key drilling components. But, the data suggests that production is likely to eventually succumb to lower prices.
"The first domino is the price, which causes other dominos to fall," said Karr Ingham , an economist who compiles the Texas PetroIndex, an annual analysis of the state's energy economy. One of the first tiles to drop: the number of permits issued, Ingham said.
Texas issued a record number of permits, 934, before dropping to 885 in October. The 885 is still more than double levels seen in the same month in 2010 when the shale revolution was just starting, but it shows a cooling off that hasn't been seen to the same degree in the past two years.
A drop in the rig count is expected two to four months after a decline in permits - and production growth would likely start to slow six months later.
"This is a pull back from the acceleration. People are being careful ," said Allen Gilmer , chief executive officer of DrillingInfo. While permits have declined at other times, Gilmer says there is currently an early indication of a slowdown in the rig count.
DrillingInfo said for 10 shale formations, a permitting slowdown was noted in October. For one formation, data was not available, and for two, the Barnett shale in Texas and the Bakken in North Dakota, permits rose slightly.
The permitting slowdown was particularly pronounced in two Texas formations, the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford shale, which saw new permits decline by 13 and 22 per cent respectively.
THE STATE OF TEXAS
This year, shale has bolstered the Texas economy , with oil production in Texas up 23 per cent in August from a year earlier, according to the Texas Petro Index, released last month.
Oil and gas jobs are at an all-time high in the state, said Ed Longanecker, president of Texas Independent Producers & Royalty Owners Association - some 414,000 according to TIPRO, a figure that has risen for each of the past five years. Economic disruptions are expected as the price decline trickles down.
"As oil prices fall, there is going to be a response, and it will ultimately turn up in the numbers," said Ingham.

Indian factory activity expanded at its fastest pace in nearly two years in November as burgeoning order books led manufacturers to accelerate output, a business survey showed on Monday.
The HSBC Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), compiled by Markit, rose to 53.3 in November from 51.6 in October, its highest since February 2013, and the thirteenth consecutive month of expansion in activity.
A Reuters poll had expected manufacturing activity to lose some steam and predicted the index would fall to 51.2.
New orders were supported by strong domestic demand for consumer goods while foreign orders remained robust. The sub-index soared to a 21-month high of 56.2 from October's 53.0.
The expansion in output encouraged manufacturers to add more jobs.
The survey also showed companies passed on additional input costs to consumers at a faster pace, which could revive inflationary pressures after several months of slowing.
"The pick-up in output prices could partly be signaling some revival in pricing power among businesses," said Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC.
Economic growth slowed to 5.3 percent in the three months to September, from 5.7 percent in the previous quarter, but the Reserve Bank of India is expected to stand pat on interest rates when it meets on Tuesday despite pressure from the government to lower borrowing costs.
The RBI's key lending rate is expected to remain unchanged at 8.0 percent until at least April.

Banks charging 22% to 26% on micro loansBanks charging 22% to 26% on micro loans to poor borrowers
Atmadip Ray, ET Bureau Dec 1, 2014, 12.26PM IST

Axis Bank
(This is the trend that has…)
KOLKATA: When it comes to lending to the poor, it is not just the micro finance institutions that charge high interest rates, but even bulgebracket banks such as Axis Bank to YES Bank charge as much as 22% to 26% a year.
This is the trend that has emerged after the Reserve Bank of India allowed banks to engage microfinance institutions (MFIs) as business correspondents in June this year.
Banks have access to low cost deposits unlike MFIs, giving access to lower cost of funds, but that does not translate into lower lending rates. In reality, private banks charge as much as micro lenders such as Bandhan Financial Services or SKS Microfinance do. "As the first set of entrants, banks are making the most of it before other creditors get comfortable with the model and start providing funds with lower rates," said Ananda Bhowmik, senior director at India Ratings.
RBI says that even though interest rates have been deregulated, charging interest beyond a certain level is considered usurious and can neither be sustainable nor be conforming to normal banking practice. The central bank remained silent on what could be the "certain level" for banks while it has put a ceiling on MFIs' lending rate which ranges between 26% and 27% a year.
Banks charging high rates defend themselves by saying that initiative to reach out to the bottom of the pyramid comes at a high cost. One of the most valued banks in India, HDFC Bank, that has a designated workforce to lend to the poor, charges around 22-24% a year, people in the know said. While others such as Axis Bank, IndusInd Bank, Ratnakar Bank, YES Bank that are exploring MFIs as business correspondents or partners to improve their respective rural lending portfolios and meet priority sector tar gets, are charging as high as 22-26% as well, four persons familiar with the matter said. Even the state-run IDBI Bank is hiring MFIs to bridge the last-mile gap.
"The rates being charged for micro-lending by banks are driven by the market. Any bank worth its salt cannot afford to be out of sync with competition. This will lead to adverse selection," said Robin Roy, associate director of PwC India.
Roy argued that private banks' cost of operations is high as they don't have direct presence in many remote locations. "Banks are still not recovering their cost of capital," he added.
"Most private banks, that engage MFIs, are charging 22-26% on micro loans to poor borrowers though we have access to low cost deposits.This is an industry phenomenon," a senior official with one of these private banks said, requesting anonymity. "The risk factor attached with lending to the poor is factored in the pricing," the official said.
  However, three senior officials in the MFI sector who confirmed that trend, said that banks have used a risk protection mechanism called `first loss deficit guarantee'. This makes banks' lending to the poor using MFI infrastructure virtually risk-free since up to 5% of the risk is being passed on to the MFIs concerned.
In general, micro lenders enjoy low default at around 1% of their outstanding loans as they have successfully built a model with regular door-to-door interface. Banks give 10% of the loan to MFIs as fee.
Most banks refrained from responding to ET's mail on high rates, while an YES Bank spokesperson said: "We would like to deny the same as this is completely incorrect, baseless and out of context."
"We lend to the under-privileged by reaching out directly to women Self Help Groups and MFIs. We provide loans to these segments at sub-15% rates," said an ICICI Bank spokesperson.
India Ratings' Bhowmik does not expect private banks to reduce lending rates on their own.
"MFIs are important intermediaries and have their own set of borrowers. So, until MFI's own cost of borrowing reduce on a sustainable basis and they start providing loans at lower rates, these banks are not going to reduce rates," he said.

MSCIs broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.9%Asian shares hit six-week lows on Swiss referendum
Reuters
Tweet
Tokyo, Dec 1:  
Gold prices tumbled on Monday after Swiss voters overwhelmingly rejected the proposals to boost gold reserves in a referendum, joining a broad rout in commodities that sent copper and oil prices to four- and five-year lows.
The slide in the oil and commodity prices is hurting many assets tied to the resource sector - from Australian mining shares to the Malaysian ringgit.
MSCI's broadest index
MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.9 per cent, hitting six-week lows.
US stock futures also slipped 0.4 per cent, though some market players think the fall could stem partly from disappointing sales at the start of the US holiday shopping season last Friday.
European stocks
European stocks are expected to fall, with Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC 40 seen shedding 0.6 per cent.
Gold fell more than two per cent at one point to $1,142.90 per ounce, its lowest level in more than three weeks, while silver was also hit, falling more than six per cent to a five-year low below $14.50 per ounce.
Swiss gold reserves plan
The Swiss gold reserves proposal, had it been approved, would have compelled the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to more than double its gold reserves and banned it from ever selling the metal, threatening its ability to defend a €1.20 cap on the Swiss franc imposed at the height of the euro zone crisis.
The Swiss franc dipped to 1.2042 on the euro from 1.2018 at the end of last week, though the Swiss currency is supported by investors who still regard it as one of the safest currencies in the world. It last stood at 1.2040.
“The result should of course temporarily relieve the pressure on the SNB’s currency floor, albeit whilst doing little or nothing in our opinion to reverse the fundamental downward trajectory of EUR/CHF,’’ said JPMorgan analyst Paul Meggyesi.
Crude oil
Oil prices hit five-year lows, unable to find a bottom despite their biggest fall in 2 1/2 years last week after OPEC held back from cutting output in the face of a supply glut.
US crude briefly fell more than three percent to a five-year low of $64.10 per barrel, with the fall from June exceeding 40 per cent. It last stood at $64.56, down 2.4 percent.
Adding fuel to the fire, Saudi Arabia's oil minister told fellow OPEC members last week that they must combat the US shale oil boom.
“They (OPEC) can get by at $60 a barrel, but that price would knock out a fair whack of the competition — much of US shale oil for example — as well as put investment in future capacity growth firmly on the back-burner,’’ ANZ analysts said in a note. “They're playing the long game, banking that others can’t.’’
Copper prices
Copper also fell to as low as $6,230.75, piercing through its March low to hit its lowest levels since mid-2010. It last stood at $6,245.50, down 1.7 per cent.
The Australian dollar fell more than one per cent to a four-year low of $0.8417 as did the Malaysian ringgit, which fell to 3.437 to the dollar.
China’s manufacturing PMI
Adding salt to commodities’ wounds, Chinese official manufacturing data suggested growth is slowing in China, demand from which has supported commodity prices for years.
Sliding oil and raw material prices have stirred deflation fears in the euro zone and Japan, cementing expectations that the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan will take more steps to support their respective economies.
The dollar, taking advantage of such concerns, attracted bids against the euro and yen.
Deflation fears
The euro was slightly weaker at $1.2449 after having fallen on Friday on news that annual inflation in the euro zone cooled to a five-year low of 0.3 per cent in November.
Many traders expect the ECB may signal further action later this week to ward off deflation.
Dollar vs yen
The dollar also hit a seven-year high of 119.03 yen and the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, rose to 88.451, a four-year high.
“Given that the Fed is going to raise rates next year, the monetary policy divergence should support the dollar,’’ said Osao Iizuka, the head of FX trading at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank.
The yen’s fall and lower commodity prices helped Japanese shares, with the Nikkei posting 0.8 per cent gains to close at seven-year high.

IPL spot-fixing: My fate was sealed in five minutes  says Sreesanthprint
The Justice Mudgal panel's final report on the IPL spot-fixing scandal has named top BCCI officials.
The Supreme Court has also made scathing observations days after the BCCI gave a clean chit to its sidelined president, N Srinivasan, and IPL COO, Sundar Raman. The BCCI's two-man panel had not found anything against Srinivasan's son-in-law and CSK official, Gurunath Meiyappan.
But the BCCI banned three Rajasthan Royals players for spot-fixing on the basis of a police chargesheet that is yet to stand scrutiny in court. The main figure in this saga, S Sreesanth, banned for life, feels cheated.
Charged by the police for bowling no balls in exchange for money in an IPL match last year, the former India pacer says in an interview to HT that he is suffering because he doesn't have a 'godfather' and that the BCCI took just five minutes to decide his fate.
Excerpts:
Do you think BCCI has done injustice to you?
It's more than injustice, but I don't want to talk about this because my case is sub judice. I don't want to make more enemies. But one thing is clear, I've not been pronounced guilty by the court. I am not bothered about others getting a clean chit. I think of myself and my cricket. There is no proof against me, but if there is, it should become clear (in the court).
Were you not given a chance to present your case properly while deposing before BCCI's Anti-Corruption officials?
They hardly even heard me and decided my fate in five minutes. I was told BCCI was looking into the matter and that I would be informed about the outcome of the inquiry. I had hardly come down and got into my car when I started getting calls from you (media) guys that I have been banned for life. I was shocked. More than anything else, I am not in a position to go back to these people. I don't have a godfather. Whatever I have earned in life is by grace of god. I have not done anything against the game. Whatever I was accused of is based on circumstantial evidence. There is nothing direct against me, nothing has been proved so far.
The Supreme Court suggests there should be overall change in BCCI. If this happens, do you see any hope?
Of course. I am not worrying about playing for India. I just want to be allowed to play for Kerala, or first class or county cricket. I love to play cricket in an honest way. Sooner or later everything will come out. I am praying for this. I just want my cricket back. I am 31-32 now. I just got four or five years of cricket left in me.
How tough were the last two years?
I have gone through something that even my enemy should not. Everything happening with me was insulting, but the biggest humiliation was taking away my cricket. My Kochi ground is just 500 metres from my home but I can't even enter it. This is everyday humiliation.
Are you following the Supreme Court hearing?
Yes. I believe something great will come out. As far as my case is concerned, one thing is clear... I am not even an accused in court, I am just a co-accused. There is nothing against me in the supplementary charge-sheet. My lawyers will argue on January 13. I have a feeling I will come clean.
So, nothing good has happened to you in life since the ban?
It's not like that. I am going to be a father soon.

Man  slaps  Gauahar Khan for wearing short skirt on reality showActor Gauahar Khan slapped for wearing short skirt on reality show

Actor and model Gauahar Khan was allegedly slapped by a 24-year-old youth who was in the audience of a singing show hosted by her at Film City, Goregaon (East), on Sunday. The Aarey Sub police have detained the suspect, Akil Malik. Police sources said the accused told them he disapproved of the actor wearing a short skirt.

According to the police, the incident took place during the final episode of India's Raw Star at studio number 9. “A preliminary probe has revealed that someone from the audience started teasing Khan to which she protested. An argument ensued between Gauahar and the man who was teasing her. Things turned ugly when the man suddenly slapped the actor,” an Aarey police officer said requesting anonymity.
India's Raw Star is an Indian singing competition series hosted by Khan and mentored by singer-rapper Yo Yo Honey Singh.
The brawl did not end there with one of the show’s finalists and one of the production men beating up the accused. Guards deployed at the venue intervened and caught the accused and handed him over to the police who later sent him for a medical examination.
A source from the show reveals, “There were over 2,500 people present at the venue with 250 bouncers. Yet a 24-year-old guy in the crowd teased Khan and got into an argument with her. While he was being escorted out of the place, he managed to go up on stage and slapped her.”
The source adds, “It was chaos after the security pulled the man away. Gauahar was shocked and was crying a lot. A stunned Gauahar didn’t understand what happened. Though the shooting was stopped, Gauahar took a break of an hour to gather her bearings and then reported back on stage to finish the leftover one hour shoot.”
“We will record Khan’s statement in detail and will register a case under section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 354 (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) of Indian Penal Code and will arrest the accused youth,” said Vilas Chavan, senior inspector of the Aarey Sub police station.

Will try to introduce GST Bill in Winter session: Jaitley
The government has proposed to implement GST from April 1, 2016, and the new Finance Commission may be set up ahead of its schedule to look into the issues related to the new indirect tax regime.
Post your opinion here
 
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today expressed hope that the much-awaited GST Bill, which  provides for a uniform indirect tax structure, would be introduced in the current winter session of Parliament.
"We will try and introduce GST (Goods and Services Tax) Bill in this session...GST Bill would be taken up by the Cabinet after Empowered Committee (of state finance Minister) meeting on December 12," he said here.
The government has proposed to implement GST from April 1, 2016, and the new Finance Commission may be set up ahead of its schedule to look into the issues related to the new indirect tax regime.
The GST will subsume indirect taxes like excise duty and service tax at the central level and VAT on the states front, besides local levies.
There are differences between the Centre and states on some issues with regard to the implementation of GST that includes the revenue neutral rate and keeping petroleum, liquor out of the ambit.
While a sub-committee on GST has suggested that the revenue neutral rate of GST be pegged at about 27 percent, the states are yet to decide on it.
It had suggested states GST at 13.91 percent and Central GST at 12.77 percent.
Besides, states have been demanding that petroleum, alcohol and tobacco should be kept out of the purview of GST. The GST Constitutional Amendment Bill, which was introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2011, had lapsed and the NDA government will be required to come up with a fresh bill.
The GST rollout has missed several deadlines because of lack of consensus among states over certain crucial issues on the new tax regime.

Moneycontrol Bureau
Investors lapped up more shares of  Asian Paints on Monday after Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BoAML) upgraded the stock to buy from neutral and raised target price to Rs 875 from 680 (18 percent potential upside). The stock gained as much as 5.55 percent to touch a record high of Rs 785.
The brokerage house sees growth accelerating to 29 percent compounded annual growth rate over FY15-17E versus 12 percent in the past four years.
According to the report, price target bakes in earnings per share upgrades of 11 percent/12 percent for FY16/FY17 led by a potential pick-up in demand due to improving macro and favorable raw material costs (especially crude linked) that can
boost margins.
"The government’s push to smart cities and bright prospects for Asian Paints’ new business – home improvement segment – can provide further upside. We bake in 15 percent lower crude prices Y-o-Y - a sharper fall - can extend margin gains," said BoAML.
The brokerage sees margins rising 270 basis points in FY15-17E due to benign raw material costs (55 percent raw material costs are crude linked), portfolio premiumisation and modest price changes.
Brent crude fell below USD 70 a barrel. Prices have fallen for five straight months and are on longest losing streak since the 2008 financial crisis.
At 12:22 hours IST, Asian Paints was quoting at Rs 781.60, up Rs 37.90, or 5.10 percent.

Brave sisters who thrashed alleged molesters to be honoured by HaryanagovtBy: Express News Service | Chandigarh |
Posted: December 2, 2014 12:38 am | Updated: December 2, 2014 10:33 am
As a video of two sisters fighting off three youths, who were allegedly harassing them inside a moving Haryana roadways bus in Rohtak, went viral on social media and was repeatedly beamed by TV networks, indignation and outrage mounted, prompting calls for strict action, and at least one Union minister exhorted women to replicate what the sisters did.
Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who on Monday hailed the “indomitable courage and bravery” of Aarti and Pooja, said they would be given cash awards on Republic Day.
Union Minister Uma Bharti decided to go a step further: “All the girls should do what these sisters did. They did well. But it is sad that none of the other passengers came to their help. Society has to change its mindset and people should stop being mere onlookers when such incidents take place.”
Union Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the incident highlighted the risks women face even in public spaces. “It is very unfortunate (incident) and very brave of these two girls… I suppose the Centre and the state will all have to work together in a focused manner, otherwise public spaces are not going to be safe,” she said.
National Commission for Women chairperson Lalitha Kumarmangalam said: “I would like to congratulate the girls and ask the authorities to take appropriate action. Few girls have the guts to take on the molesters. The government should take action. I would appeal to every Indian to come forward.”
Kuldeep, Mohit and Deepak, the three youths involved in the November 28 incident, have been arrested and remanded in judicial custody until December 6. Two of them had cleared the physical test for jobs in the army.
Shashank Anand, Rohtak Superintendent of Police, said that not a single eyewitness had approached the police so far. “I would like to request through the media that all people travelling on that bus come forward and become eyewitnesses in the case. I assure that they will face no legal hassles,” he said.
Rohtak Deputy Commissioner Shekhar Vidyarthi said Balwan Singh, the driver of the bus, and conductor Labh Singh have been placed under suspension.
“If such an incident is happening on a government property like that bus, the driver and conductor should have taken it to the police station. But that did not happen. There was a breach in the standard operating procedure. There is dereliction of duty.” Chief Minister Khattar issued instructions to the Director General of Police and Transport department to ensure the safety and security of passengers, especially women travelling in the Haryana Roadways buses.
Meanwhile, Army said they would not recruit two of the three young men involved in the incident, who had cleared the initial rounds of selection at a recruitment rally. “While Kuldeep and Deepak had cleared physical tests during the recruitment rally held between October 31 and November 8, the third youth Mohit’s details did not match Army records.

European shares were seen falling on MondayEuropean shares set to open lower
Reuters
Tweet
London, Dec 1:  
European shares were seen falling at the open on Monday as weak Chinese economic data contributed to a rout in the commodities market and early indications pointed to disappointing sales at the start of the US holiday shopping season.
At 0609 GMT, futures for the Euro STOXX 50 equity index, Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC were between 0.6 per cent and 0.8 per cent lower.
Copper tumbles to 5-yr low
London copper tumbled to its lowest in four-and-a-half years and oil fell more than $2 a barrel to a five-year low after data showed China’s factories slowed more expected in November, casting a shadow over demand prospects at a time when the oil market already faces a supply glut.
Precious metals’ miners could also come under pressure after the yellow metal slid 2 per cent on Monday and silver slumped to its lowest since 2009. Swiss voters overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to boost central bank gold reserves, providing a new trigger for sell-offs in an already nervous market.
Thanksgiving week-end sales
Adding to a more subdued market tone after a two-week rise for major European indexes, the U.S. National Retail Federation estimated sales over the full Thanksgiving week-end would show a decline of 11.3 percent from a year earlier, to $50.9 billion.
Manufacturing data from the euro zone’s three largest economies, due between 0845 GMT and 0900 GMT, could also steer the market in early trade.
European Central Bank Executive Board member Sabine Lautenschlaeger had said on Saturday she saw little room for further easing of monetary policy despite a further fall in euro zone inflation.

Zinc decline 0.6% on subdued demandZinc decline 0.6% on subdued demand
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Dec 01, 2014 01:46 PM IST
Zinc prices declined by 0.61% to Rs 137.60 per kg in futures trade today amid subdued demand in the spot markets due to sluggish demand.
Further, a weak global trend put pressure on metal prices.
At the Multi Commodity Exchange, zinc for delivery in January next year fell by 85 paise, or 0.61%, to Rs 137.60 per kg in a business turnover of eight lots.
Similarly, the metal for delivery in December traded lower by 75 paise, or 0.54%, to Rs 137.10 per kg in 511 lots.
Analysts said besides sluggish demand in the spot market, a weak trend in other base metals in global markets influenced zinc prices at futures trade.

Investor confidence on rise as private sector indicates intent for expressway expansionRevival in investor confidence: Expressway expansion draws private firms' interest
Mansi Taneja | New Delhi Dec 05, 2014 12:44 AM IST
In what could be a signal of the private sector’s interest in the roads sector returning, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has received 15-16 bids from private companies for expansion of the Delhi-Panipat expressway at a cost of around Rs 2,000 crore.
The request for proposal (RFP) would be invited soon and the award of project would follow, a senior NHAI official said. The expressway is to be widened further to have 12 lanes, including the service roads, under the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model. Though there have been award of a few projects under the BOT model in the current financial year, this is the first big project where NHAI has received bids from a number of private parties.
According to a senior ministry official, private players have again started showing interest in the roads sector, after a lull of two or three years. For a revival in the sector, the road transport and highways ministry recently formulated a new strategy under which bids for the same project would be floated under both EPC (engineering, procurement, construction) and PPP (public-private partnership) models. In the current financial year, NHAI has awarded 1,138 km of road projects, of which 511 km (three projects) has been awarded under the BOT model in public-private partnership, according to another NHAI official. The target is to award 3,700 km of projects through PPP and 2,300 km through the EPC mode this year.
A month ago, NHAI had invited rebids for four projects under the BOT model, even as bidding under the EPC model, where the government funds a project, was simultaneously on. The strategy was to save on costs and time, as well as avoid delays while awarding projects.   
A few foreign investors, including IJM Corporation Berhad, a leading construction group in Malaysia, have shown interest in projects like Eastern Peripheral Expressway (worth Rs 4,489 crore for a stretch of 135 km), Bathinda-Amritsar (worth Rs 1,899 crore for 175 km) and Ambala-Kaithal (worth Rs 878 crore for about 95 km). Therefore, the projects were bid under both models.
During the 2010-2012 period, developers bid aggressively when the government awarded a record 147 road projects, worth Rs 1.47 lakh crore. India’s economic growth, much higher at that time, slowed subsequently. Input and inflationary costs have gone up since, due to which the award of contracts for national highways has slowed down

Formula One: Mark Webber survives grave crash inBrazilBy: Agence-France Presse | Sao Paulo |
Posted: December 1, 2014 1:56 pm | Updated: December 1, 2014 3:15 pm
Veteran Australian motor racing driver Mark Webber was injured in a high-speed crash at the Six Hours of Sao Paulo event.
Webber, racing for Porsche in the World Endurance Championship after quitting Formula One last season, was stretchered off the Interlagos circuit on Monday after his car collided with the Ferrari of Matteo Cressoni.
Footage showed both cars crashing into a concrete barrier at speeds estimated at around 300km/h with Webber’s vehicle catching fire before it came to a stop with the car wrecked.
“Cressoni was checked by the medical staff at the side of the track and cleared, while Mark Webber, who was awake and alert, was taken to the circuit medical centre for further examination,” said a statement from the organisers.
Webber, 38, gave a thumbs-up to the crowd as he was taken to the medical centre although there was no immediate word of his condition.
Porsche team boss Fritz Enzinger later said Webber was recovering in a Sao Paulo hospital.
“Mark is OK, but he has had to go to hospital for further checks,” Enzinger told http://www.autosport.com .
“We have spoken to him and said that people can go and see him, so Timo (Bernhard) and Brendon (Hartley, Webber’s team-mates) have gone to the hospital.”
The race, which ended behind the safety car, was won by the Porsche of Neel Jani.
Webber’s accident brought sympathy from former rivals.
“Glad to see @AussieGrit is ok after his shunt at Interlagos @FIAWEC, that was a big one matey,” tweeted 2009 Formula One world champion Jenson Button, using Webber’s Twitter address to contact the Australian.

Titan Company soared 6.1 per cent at Rs 392.75, TBZ 15.12 per cent to Rs 173.40, Tara Jewels 7.3 per cent higher at Rs 96.50 and PC Jeweller 10.2 per cent higher at Rs 266.15.
The Reserve Bank of India issued a notification late on Friday withdrawing the norm imposed on August 14, 2013, to reduce the yawning current account deficit and relieve pressure on the rupee that had weakened sharply.
At the time, emerging markets had come under pressure because of talk about the US Federal Reserve winding down its stimulus programme.
"It has been decided by the government of India to withdraw the 20:80 scheme and restrictions placed on import of gold ," the Reserve Bank said.
The rule, along with the high customs duty of 10% - raised in stages to that level last year - had led to a rise in smuggling, besides distorting imports, ET reported.
The government said the current account deficit is no longer a concern so there is no reason to keep the curb in place, added the report.

Top 13 stocks which were downgraded in Q2Corporate EPS downgrades fly thick and fast, market cool

(Among Nifty stocks, there…)
A spate of disappointing corporate earnings for the quarter ended September 2014, thanks to a slow economic recovery, forced analysts to downgrade the FY15 earnings per share ( EPS ) estimates of about 60% of the top 300 companies (covered by at least 5 analysts). Of the 181 downgrades, 124 are mid-caps while the remaining are large-caps. Stocks, mostly belonging to consumer goods, cement, PSU banks and telecom and utilities suffered the maximum downgrades.
Some of the stocks which have been downgraded include Axis Bank , ABB , Aditya Birla Nuvo , Jindal Steel and DLF. Among Nifty stocks, there were 14 upgrades and 32 downgrades. The earning estimates of companies such as Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki and Sun Pharma have been upgraded signifi cantly.
Analysts said the consensus on earnings downgrades for FY15 & FY16, post Q2 FY15 results, belies current market euphoria. "It appears that the market is setting its sights on the growth prospects beyond FY16, ignoring the current earning downgrades and perceiving lower risk premium on India, given the improving macros, political stability, decisive governance and benign external sector," said Vinod Karki, VP-Strategic Research Group, ICICI Securities. "Assuming lower infl ation, anticipated rate cut, improving consumer sentiment, and investment revival are expected to fuel earning upgrades in FY16."

Congress releases booklet on BJP s poll promises  says Modi regime took over 25 U-turns in 180 days53
1
New Delhi: Claiming that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government at the Centre has taken over 25 U-turns in 180 days in government, the Congress on Monday released a booklet stating how the government has gone back on its poll promises. While calling it a "U-turn government", Congress leader Ajay Maken named three latest U-turns by the Centre in a press conference on Monday.
The first U-turn as specified by Maken was that Home Minister Rajnath Singh during the poll campaign had said that the country needs to know what were the circumstances and the facts of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose's death. Despite its earlier stand, the government in a reply to a recent RTI, has refused to make the documents public in connection with the mysterious death of the freedom fighter.
"Congress asks Rajnath Singh and BJP what happened now? Should the BJP and Rajnath not apologise to the people of India for misleading them," Maken said.
The Congress on Monday released a booklet stating how the BJP government has gone back on its poll promises.
#congress #upa #bjp #ajay maken
The Centre's stand on land swapping deal in Assam with Bangladesh was quoted as the second U-turn by the government. He questioned how the same members of the BJP who objected to the Congress's stand on the land deal, are now accepting the same terms and how their legal sense has changed within just six months.
"BJP has always opposed Bangladesh influx issue wen Congress was in power but now they have taken a U-turn on the same. It seems that the BJP only wanted to politicise the Bangladesh issue," Maken said.
Government's stand on Civil Nuclear Liability Bill was stated as the third of the latest U-turns by the government.
Maken also attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his promise that black money will be brought back within 100 days and Rs 15 lakh will be credited in everyone account. "We are waiting when will Rs 15 lakh be credited to our accounts as was said by Modi," Maken mocked the PM.

J&K polls: All measure taken to ensure fair  peaceful voting in the district  says Kupwara Dy CommissionerAbid Soffi , IBNLive.com | Dec 01, 2014 at 01:45pm IST
Srinagar: Expressing hope that the district will continue its previous trend and register a high voter turnout in the Legislative Assembly elections scheduled to be held on December 2, Deputy Commissioner Itrat Hussain Rafique said that all measure have been taken to ensure free, fair and peaceful polling in all the five constituencies in the border district of Kupwara.
"Kupwara district has always witnessed a very high voter turnout in both Lok Sabha and Assembly elections in the past. All precautionary measures have been taken to build confidence among people to come out and vote without any fear," Rafique said while talking to IBNLive.
He said that the authorities have set up 535 polling stations in all the five constituencies, out of which 435 are hyper sensitive, 82 are vulnerable and 83 are critical. Meanwhile, four polling stations have no voters as they have migrated.
For the first time Live Web casting at 10 polling booths have been introduced in the district.
The Kupwara Deputy Commissioner said the highest number of 129 polling booths have been set up in Kupwara and Lolab constituencies followed by 120 polling booths in Handwara, 97 in Langate and lowest 60 polling stations in Karnah.
Rafique said that there are nine polling stations close to Line of Control (LoC) which are within the firing range of the Pakistani Army. "Nine polling stations including Seemari, Karhanah, Amroha, Arohe-B, Sudpora, Jabri, Jamhim, Keran, Hardehi Bala are within the firing range from across the border. Even though no ceasefire violations have been reported so far, the district administration has taken permission from the Election Commission (EC) to shift these polling stations to safer place in the event of firing. If the firing stops say in 10 minutes, we will resume polling from the same booth," he said.
This frontier district has 248 km LoC with Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK), he said, adding 64 companies of paramilitary forces have been deployed in Handwara while 61 companies have been placed in Kupwara to maintain law and order during the elections.
All polling stations have been given a wireless sets as mobile networking is not available in some areas, he said, adding that at three places polling staff has been given satellite phones as wireless sets are also not working.
Meanwhile, for the first time Live Web casting at 10 polling booths have been introduced in the district. "Polling could be seen live in any part of the world," he said and added that only those booths have been selected which has electricity connection.
EVMs and other poll related material besides poll officials will be sent to far flung and remote areas on Monday, he said.
In case of closure of roads due to heavy snowfall, poll material and poll staff would be airlifted to cut off areas. "We have got approval from the EC to press into service 200 sorties to airlift poll material and staff to cut off areas in Machil, Karnah and other areas," he said, adding sophisticated snow clearance machines and recovery vans are also ready to meet any snow challenge.
Meanwhile, a high level security review of the arrangements made for the Assembly polling in the district was held under GOC 15 Corps Lt General Subrata Saha and Inspector General of Police Abdul Gani Lone on Sunday.
"We have taken all necessary measures to provide conducive atmosphere to 3,99,776 voters, who will exercise their franchise on December 2," Kupwara Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) MR Bhat said.
Even though the Army is not directly involved in the Electoral process, Bhat said that it has been deployed in major parts of the district, particularly on the LoC to foil any terrorist attacks and infiltration bid from PoK.

Chandigarh: A day after three men got belted by two siblings on a moving bus in Haryana's Rohtak district for harassing them, the state government on Monday suspended the driver and conductor of the bus.
Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar lauded the girls for their bravery. "I will recommend the names of the brave girls for bravery awards given during Republic Day," the CM said.
The state has also asked all the bus drivers and conductors to prevent such incidents in the future.
#haryana #rohtak #sisters #siblings
The three men reportedly assaulted the two girls when they objected to eve teasing. The girls in turn did not lose courage and retaliated by thrashing the assailants with their belts.
Recalling the incident, one of the two girls said that the men had tried to molest her sister to which they protested. Though she also added that after they fought back by beating the men with the belts, the two sisters were thrown out of the bus.

Sherwood College student s death: Family meets Maneka Gandhi  seeks justice8
0
New Delhi: Family of the Sherwood school student Shaan Shreshta, who died of septicemia in November, met Union Women and Child Welfare Minister Maneka Gandhi in Delhi on Thursday. The grieving family has demanded action against the college's principal.
Maneka Gandhi has assured the family members that she would take up the issue with Union HRD Minister Smriti Irani.
"My son's death was due to negligence of the school. We were not informed at all when he was sick, we were only informed at the last moment when he was admitted to the ICU in a very critical state," said Shaan's mother Meena Shreshta.
#sherwood college #dehradun #nainital #student
Shreshtra said that students and teachers at the college were not willing to speak against the principal as they feared action against them. "The teachers and students are afraid to speak up during his tenure. If he is removed, many people will speak up," she said.
She added that even some of the parents had approached her, willing to give their statements.
"We met the Uttarakhand CM yesterday, and he said that the incident involving Shaan's death has shamed the entire state. I have been informed that PM Modi was informed about the case - we will be chasing that at the PMO," said Tejaswee Shreshta, family friend.
The family plans to take up the matter with Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh next.
Shaan, a Nepalese, was a student of Nainital-based Sherwood College. He died of septicemia on November 14 in a Delhi hospital. His family has accused the college authorities of negligence which led to his death.

Nothing classy about Lautens criticism of the Obama girlsPresident Barack Obama speaks as his daughters Sasha and Malia look on before pardoning “Cheese” and his alternate “Mac,” both 20-week old, 48-pound turkeys, during a ceremony at the White House on Nov. 26. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images)
Raising teenagers is hard.
I know from experience — and I haven’t had to do it under the watchful eye of the White House press corps. Or the hyper-critical eye of  Elizabeth Lauten , communications director for Rep. Stephen Fincher, a Republican from Tennessee. (Update: Lauten resigned on  Monday.)
If you haven’t heard yet — and to be honest, my attention was focused on a Thanksgiving turkey that didn’t get pardoned — Lauten blasted President Obama’s daughters, Sasha, 13, and Malia, 16, for their facial expressions, body language and outfits during the annual Thanksgiving turkey pardoning ceremony.
Then she made things worse with what sounded like a half-hearted attempt at an apology that tried to show what a good person Lauten must be since she realized “how hurtful” her words were “after many hours of prayer.”
If Lauten were a mom, particularly of teen girls, she’d have a lot more empathy, I suspect, and she’d probably agree with me that kids in the White House should be off-limits to media scrutiny. If you don’t like the president, fine. Criticize his policies, his actions, his decisions.
But don’t pick on his kids or say he’s a bad dad because his girls rolled their eyes at his jokes.
I still remember Rush Limbaugh calling Chelsea Clinton a dog on his television show. She was just 13 years old — that often-awkward age for young girls — and it’s a wonder he didn’t scar her for life with his attempts to poke fun at her. He also referred to Amy Carter as possibly “the most unattractive presidential daughter in the history of this country.”
Such comments aren’t funny. They’re just cruel.
So when I read Lauten’s comment, I found a video of the event in question, wondering what kind of disrespectful faces the girls made. Yes, they looked bored, there was a little eye-rolling (those jokes might’ve deserved it) and when Malia was asked by her dad if she wanted to pet the now-pardoned turkey, she said, “Nah.” I thought she was restrained, and she did get a big laugh from the audience.
At the 67th anniversary of the National Thanksgiving Turkey presentation on Wednesday, President Obama pardoned two Ohio turkeys that will now live at the home of a former Virginia governor. (AP)
As for their wardrobe choices earning them “a spot at a bar” — a really inappropriate analogy for underage girls — I have to defend the girls. Has Lauten seen any teenaged girls lately at her local mall?
To be honest, I don’t remember the last time I was in a bar, but I did attend the National Honor Society induction ceremony at my son’s high school last month here in Kansas. The boys wore suits, the girls wore black dresses. Some pretty short dresses. With some pretty high heels.
Short skirts are in style. And when you’re a teenaged girl, there is perhaps nothing worse on this earth than to wear something that isn’t in style.
Neither of the Obama daughters showed cleavage at the turkey pardoning. They both wore long sleeves. Yes, their skirts were short. Malia wore dark tights with hers. My son’s high school would not have sent either one home for indecent clothing.
After the firestorm of criticism erupted against Lauten, she posted an apology, but she never used the words, “I’m sorry,” and she didn’t direct her comments directly to Malia and Sasha, as she should have. How about, “I don’t agree with your father’s policies, but I’m sorry for attacking the two of you”?
Instead, she described how she prayed for hours. Did she not recall what many say is the basic message of Jesus Christ? “Love one another.”
“Love one another.” That doesn’t mean posting hateful messages against young girls on Facebook . It means showing respect, even when you disagree with others. It means practicing kindness. It means being nice and remembering that we are all human.
That message was expanded in Sunday’s sermon by Adam Hamilton, the senior pastor at the United Methodist Church of the Resurrection in Leawood, Kan. when he said, “Jesus called us to love our neighbors and to love our enemies.”
Lauten’s original post linked to an article  from a conservative site that concluded, “I don’t think you would have ever seen the Bush daughters in dresses that short. Class is completely absent from this White House.” It seems like Lauten, whose job is to put the spin on the message, should have known better than to pick up this gauntlet of hate and run with it.
Expressing such disdain for young girls hardly seems like the way for Republicans to woo women, minorities and youth.
Or the way for one Republican woman to stay employed. There’s already a Facebook page and an online petition calling for Lauten to resign — or for Fincher to fire her.
As for Sasha and Malia — I hope someone shows them this video of Chelsea Clinton, who said, “I’m a believer in a thick skin as a survival tactic….I have the indubious honor of being compared to a dog as a 13-year-old by Rush Limbaugh. That was not about me, that was about him.”

India Post Poised to Ramp up Revenues From E-commerce by Leveraging Deep NetworkIndia Post Poised to Ramp up Revenues From E-commerce by Leveraging Deep Network
Moody s downgrades Japan to A1 from Aa3Moody's downgrades Japan to A1 from Aa3
India Infoline News Service | Mumbai | December 01, 2014 14:21 IST
The A1 rating reflects the government's significant credit strengths, including a large, diverse economy with a strong external position, very high institutional strength and a very strong domestic funding base.
 
 
Moody's Investors Service today downgraded the Government of Japan's debt rating by one notch to A1 from Aa3. The outlook is stable.
The key drivers for the downgrade are the following:
1. Heightened uncertainty over the achievability of fiscal deficit reduction goals;
2. Uncertainty over the timing and effectiveness of growth enhancing policy measures, against a background of deflationary pressures; and
3. In consequence, increased risk of rising JGB yields and reduced debt affordability over the medium term.
The A1 rating reflects the government's significant credit strengths, including a large, diverse economy with a strong external position, very high institutional strength and a very strong domestic funding base.
The stable outlook reflects the broad balance between upside risks including significant fiscal consolidation and a resumption of economic growth, and downside risks including intensification of deflationary pressures and loss in economic momentum.
The rating action does not affect Japan's Aaa foreign currency, local currency country and bank deposit ceilings. Those ceilings act as a cap on ratings that can be assigned to the obligations of other entities domiciled in the country.
RATINGS RATIONALE
RATIONALE FOR DOWNGRADE
DRIVER 1: HEIGHTENED UNCERTAINTY OVER REACHING FISCAL TARGETS AND CONTAINING DEBT
The first driver for the downgrade of the Japan government's debt rating to A1 is the rising uncertainty over whether the government's medium-term deficit reduction goal is achievable, and whether policy makers can overcome the tensions inherent in promoting growth while simultaneously stabilizing and reversing the rising debt trajectory.
The Bank of Japan remains committed to monetary expansion, with some positive impact on core CPI inflation. However, while monetary expansion has boosted domestic aggregate demand to some extent, the consumption tax increase on April 1 2014 has exerted even more powerful downward pressure. At least in the short term, deficit reduction is undermining the growth revitalization objective of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's economic policy strategy.
The government's response, to announce a delay in the second step in the consumption tax increase, appears to represent a shift in policy towards stemming re-emerging deflationary pressures on economic growth and away from near-term fiscal deficit reduction. This strategy could have merits. In our view, the government's target of halving the primary deficit balance, excluding budgetary interest payments, by fiscal 2015 from its fiscal 2010 level will be difficult to achieve without more robust nominal GDP growth and hence improved buoyancy in tax revenues. In their absence, reaching the long-term target of a primary balance surplus by 2020 will be even more challenging.
However, the strategy also poses risks to fiscal consolidation and, over the longer-term, to debt affordability and sustainability. Japan's deficits and debt remain very high, and fiscal consolidation will become increasingly difficult to achieve as time passes given rising government spending, particularly for social programs associated with a rapidly ageing population.
The government acknowledges that additional but as yet unidentified economic and fiscal reforms will be needed for Japan to achieve its primary balance target in the second half of this decade. But the postponement of the second stage of the increase in the consumption tax has resulted in the delay of the 2015 budget, and a concrete plan to meet fiscal targets is not likely to emerge until the second half of 2015. The trajectory of government debt, projected at 245% of GDP in 2014 according to the IMF, will only start to decline under the most favorable combination of economic and fiscal reforms, including tax and social security system reforms and total factor productivity improvements, an end to deflation and achievement of annual nominal GDP growth of more than 3.5%. Given current domestic circumstances and lackluster external demand for Japan's exports, achieving these conditions will be challenging.
DRIVER 2: ECONOMIC GROWTH POLICY UNCERTAINTIES AND CHALLENGES IN ENDING DEFLATION
The second driver for the downgrade is the rising uncertainty over the government's ability to enhance medium term growth through structural economic reform -- the third 'arrow' of Abenomics -- success in which will be crucial to achieve fiscal consolidation. While some indicators suggest a pick-up in economic activity over the past year, potential economic growth remains low.
GDP growth sharply contracted in the second quarter of this year following the introduction on 1 April of the first step of the consumption tax increase, to 8% from 5%. Output was also affected by adverse weather in the summer to some extent. And both real and nominal GDP contracted again in the third quarter of the year, putting Japan's economy in recession for the third time since global financial crisis.
Moreover the relapse of the GDP deflator, the broadest measure of price movements, into negative territory in the third quarter of this year highlights the difficult nature of ending more than a decade of deflation. Although the ratcheting up by the Bank of Japan of its quantitative easing policies in October may once again move the deflator back onto positive ground in the fourth quarter of 2014, the task ahead for economic revitalization and price reflation is looking more challenging than envisaged by Prime Minister Abe when he introduced his three-arrow economic policy package in March 2013.
Looking further ahead, the most notable structural reform measure to be implemented to date is a reduction in corporate taxation beginning in fiscal 2015. The details have yet to be announced, and the implications for business investment are therefore still unclear. It is not yet clear what further measures the government will choose, or be able, to take to address the deep-rooted structural problems of Japan's economy, including broadening labor force participation, enhancing corporate governance and dealing with the challenges posed by demographic trends.
DRIVER 3: EROSION OF POLICY EFFECTIVENESS AND CREDIBILITY COULD UNDERMINE DEBT AFFORDABILITY
The third driver for the downgrade is the potential implications of the first two drivers for the affordability and sustainability of Japan's huge debt load. Debt sustainability will rest on the continued willingness of domestic investors to provide funding at affordable rates for the government. This looks likely to remain the case as long as investor confidence is not undermined. The JGB market has been characterized by low and stable interest rates despite the exceptional rise in debt since the 1990s. And JGB interest rates have remained low and stable through a number of crisis episodes, including Japan's 1997-1998 financial crisis, the 2008 global financial crisis and the 2011 tsunami and Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster.
Nonetheless, the Bank of Japan's efforts to raise inflation to 2% may eventually put pressure on government bond yields and thereby raise government borrowing costs. Rising interest rates would increase expenditure and offset gains from revenue buoyancy. Rising uncertainty regarding the government's capacity to deliver on its policy objectives could raise yields without any commensurate rise in revenues. Either outcome would further undermine the government's ability to meet its fiscal deficit targets and reduce its debt burden over the medium term, and eventually start to undermine debt sustainability.
RATIONALE FOR A1 RATING AND STABLE OUTLOOK
JAPAN'S CREDIT STRENGTHS SUPPORTED BY A DEEP DOMESTIC BOND MARKET, STRONG INSTITUTIONS, LOW VULNERABILITY TO EXTERNAL SHOCKS
Whatever the challenges facing the government, Japan retains very significant credit strengths. Its A1 rating and stable outlook are supported by its large, diverse economy, which we characterize as having 'High' economic strength. And even with the very significant debt burden, we believe that Japan exhibits only 'Low' susceptibility to event risk. A marked home bias on the part of resident investors provides a strong funding base --domestic investors retain a marked preference for government bonds, which has allowed fiscal deficits to be funded at the lowest nominal rates globally over the past two decades. Private sector fiscal surpluses remain more than adequate to fund government deficits, without the government resorting to external funding. We believe that very high institutional and structural strengths, including a decisive and powerful central bank, currently sustain this funding advantage and are very unlikely to diminish over the rating horizon.
Although Japan's government gross financing requirements are far larger than other advanced country governments', contingent risks which could elevate further such financing needs are low and remote. Japan's banking and corporate sectors have restored their health in recent years in terms of capitalization and deleveraging. Household debt is at a moderate level and has remained stable over the past decade. And despite low economic growth, Japan's labor market is relatively sound in regard to key features, such as low unemployment level, the recent pick-up in employment and nominal wages and a labor force participation rate broadly comparable with other advanced economies.
Related to Japan's home bias is its strong external payments position, which reflects the accumulated system-wide savings. At more than 60% of GDP in 2013, Japan's net international investment position is much larger than any advanced industrial G-20 economy, insulating its economy and capital market from global shocks. Income earned from Japan's sizable external assets has helped to sustain the current account surpluses, although this has diminished owing to a shift into a trade deficit which is in large part driven by the demand for energy imports following the shutdown in the nuclear power industry after the 2011 tsunami and Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster.
WHAT COULD MOVE THE RATING DOWN / UP
While the stable outlook indicates that we believe the rating is well positioned for the next twelve to eighteen months, factors that could prompt a negative rating action include significant divergence from the path toward achieving fiscal targets; an intensification of deflationary pressures; a severe loss in economic momentum; or a shift in the external current account surplus into persistent deficit.
Moody's would consider a positive rating action if Japan were to implement policies that we concluded were likely to restore economic momentum and improve prospects for significant fiscal consolidation and debt reduction.

Developers  banks lose Rs 400 cr each day due to decision delays‘Developers, banks lose Rs 400 cr each day due to decision delays’
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Dec 1:  
The infrastructure and banking industry suffers losses worth around Rs 400 crore per day due to delayed decision-making at various levels, Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari said here today.
The Minister said when he took charge in May, he was given the uphill task of untangling investments worth Rs 1,80,000 crore in the sector due to lag in land acquisition, forest and environmental clearances.
“The (previous) Government was mainly responsible for about Rs 1,80,000 crore worth of projects stuck. It was 90 per cent the Government’s responsibility and 10 per cent the fault of contractors and bankers,” Gadkari said at an Assocham event.
“Delays in taking decisions costs about Rs 400 crore each day to developers and bankers,” he added.
As many as 189 projects worth Rs 1,80,000 crore were stuck due to problems in land acquisition, delays in forest and environmental clearances, non-transfer of defence land and hurdles in rail over-bridges.
Problems in most of the projects have been cleared and the rest of the work is in progress, said Gadkari, adding that after clearing the backlog, Road Ministry aspires to build 30 km of roads each day.
The Government is currently working on projects worth Rs 21,000 crore in Jammu & Kashmir and Rs 15,000 crore in the North-Eastern region.
The Minister further said the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is working on improving the main accident spots on various highways in the country.

The number of members, who enrolled in the campaign, has already crossed 1-crore mark, he said.
Verification process
Stating that the party will go to the doorsteps of those who have enrolled as members, he said the process of this verification will begin after March 31.
The party witnessed a massive support from voters in the Lok Sabha elections, and a majority of the voters were youths. The membership campaign is an initiative to convert those supporters into voters.
Rao said that most political parties in the country have become family-run parties, and no political party has got internal democracy. In this situation, BJP is positioned as an important party available to them, he said.
The party is highly focused on states such as West Bengal, Assam and Orissa, and southern states, he said. BJP is also becoming aggressive in Karnataka, as it is an important state feeding Congress and its ideas, he added.

Sensex take a hit as Moody s cuts Japan to A3; top stocksApollo Tyres Ltd
(At 11:40 a.m.; the 50-share…)
NEW DELHI: NEW DELHI: The S&P BSE Sensex pared gains and was trading in the red after rising as much as 116 points in trade on Monday, as Moody's Investors Service downgraded Japan's sovereign debt rating by one notch to A1 from Aa3, citing heightening uncertainty over the country's ability to hit its debt-reduction goal.
The announcement briefly sent the yen to a seven-year low against the dollar and pushed 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) futures down by 10 ticks.
The US rating agency said the outlook was stable.
Tracking the momentum, the 50-share Nifty index which rose to its record high of 8623 earlier in trade came off from its highs, led by losses in Jindal Steel, NMDC, Tata Power , Sesa Sterlite and BHEL.

Nifty Retreats From Record High, Hovers Near 8,600
NDTV | Updated On: December 01, 2014 13:24 (IST)
Oil Slumps Near $59 for First Time Since 2009 on Oversupply
NSE Nifty retreated from record highs today on some selling pressure in metal, oil & gas and capital goods stocks. The Nifty rose nearly 35 points to hit a record high of 8,623 today in early trade as oil prices tumbled to a five-year low. Some caution also set in ahead of RBI policy review scheduled for tomorrow, traders said.
Oil-users were among the top gainers today. Jet Airways surged nearly 6 per cent, while Asian Paints traded 5 per cent higher. Apollo Tyres rose nearly 3 per cent and state-run oil marketing company Hindustan Petroleum Corp jumped over 2 per cent. The fall in crude oil will boost operating margins for users and increase discretionary spends in the economy, analysts say.
"We believe there is still room for the downstream crude players or those that use crude as a raw material to move north, be it paints, tyres, OMCs or lubricant companies," said Jyotheesh Kumar, executive vice-president of HDFC Securities.
Markets also got a boost after the government scrapped a rule mandating traders to export 20 per cent of all gold imported into the country.
Friday's move to ease gold imports sent jewellery stocks sharply higher today. Titan, India's biggest gold company surged over 6.5 per cent, while Rajesh Exports traded with over 3 per cent gains.
Banking shares also traded higher ahead of crucial Reserve Bank policy announcement tomorrow. Traders have pinned their hopes on a rate cut, but most economists say the central bank will hold rates. Lenders such as Axis Bank and PNB rose over 1 per cent.
Shares in Maruti Suzuki and TVS Motor jumped on Monday after the automakers reported better-than-estimated sales numbers for the month of November.
Maruti Suzuki gained over 2 per cent to a day high of Rs 3,414.75, while shares in TVS Motor surged over 4 per cent to a day high of Rs 239.50.
India has been the best-performing emerging market this year on the back of record buying by foreign investors. On Friday, FIIs bought shares worth Rs 936 crore. They have invested over $40 billion in debt and equities this calendar year.
The rupee was trading at 62.15 vs Friday's close of 62.02. The Indian currency hit a low of 62.25 earlier, a level last seen on February 20.
Among top Nifty losers, Sesa Sterlite, Jindal Steel and Power, NMDC, BHEL and ONGC were down over 2 per cent.
At 1:17 pm, the Sensex was down 8 points to 28,686 while Nifty was almost unchanged at 8,589.

Game over for Mallya? MCF may be last UB citadel to fall
After losing control of marquee firms United Spirits and United Breweries, it appears that one of the last-remaining jewels in UB’s crown, Mangalore Chemicals and Fertilizers (MCF), is set to go.
Post your opinion here
Nazim Khan
moneycontrol.com
After losing control of marquee firms United Spirits  and United Breweries , it appears that one of the last-remaining jewels in UB’s crown, Mangalore Chemicals and Fertilizers (MCF) , is set to go.
In a filing to the stock exchange this morning, the company said its chairman Vijay Mallya had stepped down from its board with immediate effect.
The move comes two months after United Bank of India declared the UB honcho a ‘willful defaulter’ (though Mallya later managed to obtain a court injunction on the order), relating to debt to the tune of Rs 6,500 crore his grounded airliner Kingfisher owes to banks.
UBI's move was followed by State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, IDBI Bank and UCO Bank all slapping him a notice asking why he should not be declared one.
The development at MCF comes in the wake of an interesting battle for takeover of the firm, in which Pune-based rival Deepak Fertilizers has been looking to seek control.
It all started in July last year when Deepak picked up 24 percent stake in MCF from a host of investors, and has since gone on to pick up additional shares through the open market.
Sensing a takeover attempt, Mallya, whose UB group held about 22 percent in MCF, sent out feelers to his “good friend” Saroj Poddar, whose firm Zuari, promptly began increasing its own stake in the firm from 10 percent to about 16 percent presently.
MCF, Deepak and Zuari all operate in the fertilizer business and while Zuari itself was at one point eyeing a takeover of MCF, Poddar ruled out a hostile attempt of the firm citing old relations with the UB chief’s late father Vittal Mallya.
It soon boiled down a two-way battle between UB-Zuari (which together held 38 percent) on one side and Deepak (with a little over 25 percent) on the other, and both camps launched a series of rivaling open offers.
Deepak was seen racing ahead when it launched an open offer to acquire additional 20 percent in the firm at a price of Rs 93 to a share, which clearly topped the Rs 81 per share offer Zuari-UB could put together.
The Deepak camp got a further boost after Mallya was declared a willful defaulter. RBI norms essentially block out willful defaulters from operating on the boards of any firm, as banks are prohibited from lending to such firms.
Deepak must have hoped it would use Mallya’s willful defaulter tag as a stick to beat him with. But even as -- by standing aside from the board -- Mallya has clearly saved MCF from adverse questions arising out of the willful defaulter tag hanging on him, it clearly loosens his grip on the last major firm in UB's control.
The backdrop of recent events at United Spirits, in which Mallya has managed to stay on as chairman even as Diageo has acquired management control, may serve as a precursor to what may lie ahead for MCF.
At a United Spirits extraordinary general meeting, minority shareholders recently blocked a number of resolutions that were seen as being overtly favourable to Mallya.
While no replacement has been named at MCF, his resignation has clearly tipped the scale in Deepak’s favour, whose stake has now increased to about 32 percent following the open offer.
If it were to muster some support from institutional shareholders (many of whom tendered in some of their shares to Deepak), it won’t be surprising if it finally manages to wrest management control of the firm, bringing in an interesting culmination to a year-and-a-half takeover battle, rare as they are in the Indian corporate arena.
United Spirits stock price
On December 10, 2014, United Spirits closed at Rs 2760.30, down Rs 85.9, or 3.02 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 2944.00 and the 52-week low was Rs 2226.00.
The latest book value of the company is Rs 262.47 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company was 10.52.

Focusing on improving connectivity to the Northeast, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said the Centre would provide Rs 28,000 crore for laying new railway lines in the region and develop the "untapped" tourism potential of the area.
The Prime Minister also said that the Centre has sanctioned Rs 5000 crore to provide 2G mobile coverage in this area for comprehensive telecom development plan of the northeast region. "So many tourists are coming here from other parts of the country and abroad. This is the best destination for tourists. But for that we require connectivity. Unless we have road connectivity, rail connectivity, air connectivity, it is very difficult to develop tourism. "That is why for the development of this area and for the development of tourism, Rs 28,000 crore will be provided for a new railway-line project and 14 new railway lines", he said inaugurating Nagaland's biggest annual Hornbill festival here.
"I believe that the Hornbill Festival will improve the tourism sector in Nagaland and the people of India will be the beneficiary," he said. As energy is a lifeline for development, Rs 5000 crore has been sanctioned for the northeastern region power system improvement project for six states, including Nagaland, the Prime Minister said.
"Our goal is 24X7, 365 days power supply and to achieve that we are focusing on the northeastern states. "Nowadays the infrastructure meaning has totally changed. Besides road and rail connectivity, we require digital connectivity. Internet connectivity is most required. Now the youth cannot stay without mobile phones, without Internet," he said.

Everyone believes that the oil-price decline is temporary. It is assumed that once oil prices plummet, the process is much more likely to be self-stabilizing than destabilizing.
Our analysis leads us to conclude that the price of oil is unlikely to average $100 again for the remaining decade. We will use an oil rebound to gradually adjust our portfolio to reflect this new reality.

Braveheart sisters thrash three eve-teasersMustering courage, two harassed college-going sisters thrashed three eve-teasers inside a moving bus with passengers remaining mute spectators to their plight.
Police said all the three youths — Kuldeep, Mohit and Deepak — have been arrested.
“We have arrested the three accused and they will be produced before court,” Rohtak SP Shanshank Anand said over phone.
A case under section 354 (assault or criminal force with intent to outrage woman’s modesty) and section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) have been registered against them, he said.
The incident triggered spontaneous indignation from women rights activists, with National Commission for Women chairperson Lalitha Kumarmangalam asking the authorities to take appropriate action against he accused.
Both sisters confronted the accused, with one of the girls even hitting the youths with her belt.
The entire incident, recorded by a passenger on mobile phone, went viral both on television and social media. It showed the two girls using hand and belt to thrash the eve teasers, who appeared to be taken by surpise.
The parents of the two girls lodged an FIR with Haryana police against the three youths informing that the molesters got down at the Kansla village in Rohtak.
The victims in their complaint alleged that they were “teased” by some youths in a Haryana Roadways bus when they were going to their college on Friday.
When the victims objected, one of the accused started beating them up.
Not go give up easily, the girls fought with the accused as fellow passengers remained mute spectators. One of the victims even hit the accused with a belt, police said.
One of the girls said, “They threatened us and abused us. One of them touched my sister inappropriately. They started making obscene gestures … After heated exchanges, one of the boys called his friends asking him to beat us up. One of them beat my sister while two others caught hold of me.
“Then, I whipped out my belt at thrashed them. They pushed us out of the bus when it slowed down,” she narrated.
The girl also said that she called the emergency helpline number but the response from the other end was that they will return the call within two minutes. However, there was no response.
She said that instead of helping them, some passengers advised them against fighting with the boys, warning that they might even be killed another day.
“None of the passengers came to our rescue. While some watched the drama, others were apprehensive fearing for their own safety,” one girl said.
Meanwhile, the father of the two sisters alleged that there was pressure from the panchayat that the girls should withdraw the complaint.
Reacting strongly to the incident, women rights activist Abha Singh said, “It’s an offence under Section 354a. This is a non-bailable offence. The culprits must be arrested immediately. The people in bus did not come to the help of the girls. We need to amend the law that those who don’t help the victims of molestation should also be punished.
Commenting on the incident, National Commission for Women chairperson Lalitha Kumarmangalam said, “I would like to congratulate the girls and ask the authorities to take appropriate action. Few girls have the guts to take on the molesters. The government should take action. I would appeal to every Indian to come forward and help.”

Hacked email accounts cause spam to spread fasterHacked email accounts cause spam to spread faster: Research
ANI     Washington   Last Updated: November 28, 2014  | 12:02 IST
Picture for representation purpose only. (Source: Reuters)
A new research has found that spam spreads much faster and to more people when it is being propagated by hacked, or otherwise compromised, email accounts rather than legitimate accounts.
According to a research published in the International Journal of Security and Networks, spam sent from hacked accounts is often given more credence than anonymous spam or spam with an obviously scurrilous or scandalous source.
In some cases, the recipients believe the spam content is correct and forward it to their friends who may, in turn, forward it to their friends. Large numbers of accounts are hacked through malicious software or by guessing passwords with the purpose of using them as hosts for sending out vast numbers of spam messages. However, modeling the spread of this kind of information usually assumes that the source is a human deliberately sharing the information.
Hacked accounts tend to more aggressively send spam, partly because deliberately, individually propagated spam is done manually, whereas hacked spam is more commonly generated automatically by the malware that has infected the account in the first place. This aggressive behavior of hacked accounts causes spam to reach more people faster. The online equivalent of word-of-mouth is powerful when a message is repeatedly and forcibly sent to one's inbox, the research said.

Standing committee advises Centre to keep state govts in loopWritten by Abantika Ghosh | New Delhi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 12:59 am
The department-related standing committee on external affairs has recommended in its report on the Land Boundary Agreement (LBA) with Bangladesh that state governments should be consulted about the settlement at all stages. The report is likely to be tabled in Parliament next week.
Sources said the report also makes it clear that consultation with state governments should preferably happen at the level of highest political leadership rather than at the level of bureaucrats. “In the past, consultations have been at the level of the bureaucracy, but that is not sufficient. It should be the prime minister or at least the foreign minister who engages with the state government,” said a source.
In 2011, then PM Manmohan Singh and his Bangladesh counterpart Sheikh Hasina had signed an accord on the exchange of enclaves of both countries held by each other, popularly known as chhitmahals. The pact talks about giving the residents of these areas the choice of either continuing to reside in their current locations or to move to a country of their choice. The agreement had been referred to the standing committee last year after the opposition of parties like TMC and the Asom Gana Parishad.
The matter of consultation with state governments has been a sore point, with West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee holding that no settlement that does not take into account the Bengal government’s point of view would be acceptable.
Sources said Banerjee is of the opinion that Bengal should have a say in the matter as it would need to shoulder a bulk of the responsibility of relocating and rehabilitating the enclave residents.

Malaria outbreak hits anti-Naxal opsBy: Express News Service | Raipur |
Posted: December 1, 2014 2:41 am
An outbreak of malaria in Bastar has severely impacted the security forces on the Naxal front. At least one policeman, Govind Tamga, has died and over 400 have been affected by the disease in the last 10 days. Besides the personnel, a huge number of villagers have been hit by the disease.
The situation is compounded by the lack of medicare in Bastar as the region has only one major hospital in Jagdalpur, which lacks capacity to treat the influx of patients. The male ward of the hospital is brimming over and over 50 personnel of the state police and the CRPF have to lie on the floor. The Bastar IG has asked the government to provide immediate help.
“Our operations have been affected. We have asked the state government to immediately take note of the situation and ensure medicare for policemen,” said IG S R P Kalluri.
“We have given special instructions to our forces posted in sensitive areas,” he said.
Such has been the impact that at least two anti-Naxal operations in the region were to be curtailed last week as the personnel were hit by the disease in forests, forcing the commanding officers to order an immediate retreat.
Bastar’s malaria officer Sanjay Basak said the sudden outbreak of malaria is a serious issue. “So far we were giving them chloroquine and primaquine for malaria, but these have proved ineffective. We have taken advice from the WHO’s officers about other medicines,” he added.
While some policemen, whose condition turned serious, have been airlifted to Raipur, at least 200 are still in police camps of interior areas and yet to receive medicare.
Speaking to TV reporters, the personnel admitted  to hospital said they were not given proper care and were forced to spend on their own.

Deflated tyre delays Air India flight by 3 hoursDeflated tyre delays Air India flight by three hours
Agencies        Last Updated: December 1, 2014  | 10:23 IST
Picture for representational purpose.
A tyre of a Delhi-bound Air India (AI) plane from Mumbai with over 120 people on board was found deflated after landing at Jodhpur on Sunday following which the flight was briefly stalled leading to a delay of more than three hours.
The flight (AI-476) operating on Airbus 319 aircraft on Mumbai-Delhi via Jodhpur route landed safely at Jodhpur airport afternoon, but when it was to take off for Delhi, one of its tyres was found deflated, a Jodhpur airport official told news agency PTI over telephone.
He said that the plane landed at 11.40 AM at Jodhpur airport, when the pilot felt some unusual jerks. After observation, it was found that one of the tyres had reduced pressure.
The incident caused panic for a moment after the news of plane's tyre burst spread, but was soon denied by the airport officials, the official said. An AI spokesperson in New Delhi confirmed the incident saying one of the tyres got deflated after it landed at Jodhpur.
Spare tyres, along with engineers and technicians, were sent from Delhi by another plane, following which it was repaired, he said.
"The plane finally took off for Delhi around 1605 hours after change of tyre," the spokesperson added. Meanwhile, Jodhpur Police commissioner Ashok Kumar Rathore said that a police team was sent from Ratanada Thana to the airport for any assistance if required by the airport authorities. Airport officials said that while the tyre was being replaced, all the passengers were taken to the terminal and taken care off. In recent months, several AI flights have been hit by technical faults and in some cases have had to be cancelled.
In October, as many as 180 passengers on Pune-Delhi flight AI-854 had a harrowing time as they were kept waiting for two days in a row at the airport as the aircraft developed a technical snag and the engineers could not rectify it even a day later. An Airbus A320 was then flown from Delhi to Pune to fetch the passengers.
A few days before this incident, as many as 160 passengers travelling by an AI flight from Ahmedabad to Chennai via Hyderabad were delayed by 20 hours after the aircraft developed a technical snag. 

PM Narendra Modi announces Rs 28 000 crore for new railway lines  Rs 5 000 cr for 2G coverage for North-EastTata Steel close to reopening its top iron ore mine
Focusing on improving connectivity to the Northeast, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said the Centre would provide Rs 28,000 crore for laying new railway lines in the region and develop the “untapped” tourism potential of the area.
The Prime Minister also said that the Centre has sanctioned Rs 5000 crore to provide 2G mobile coverage in this area for comprehensive telecom development plan of the northeast region.
“So many tourists are coming here from other parts of the country and abroad. This is the best destination for tourists. But for that we require connectivity. Unless we have road connectivity, rail connectivity, air connectivity, it is very difficult to develop tourism.
“That is why for the development of this area and for the development of tourism, Rs 28,000 crore will be provided for a new railway-line project and 14 new railway lines”, he said inaugurating Nagaland’s biggest annual Hornbill festival here.
“I believe that the Hornbill Festival will improve the tourism sector in Nagaland and the people of India will be the beneficiary,” he said.
As energy is a lifeline for development, Rs 5000 crore has been sanctioned for the northeastern region power system improvement project for six states, including Nagaland, the Prime Minister said.
“Our goal is 24X7, 365 days power supply and to achieve that we are focusing on the northeastern states.
“Nowadays the infrastructure meaning has totally changed. Besides road and rail connectivity, we require digital connectivity. Internet connectivity is most required. Now the youth cannot stay without mobile phones, without Internet,” he said.
The Prime Minister said his government has decided to set up a National Sports University in Manipur and the people of the region will be “great beneficiaries”.
The NE region could be the organic capital of the country, Modi said, adding that the Centre has decided to set up six new agriculture colleges in this area.
“We have decided to set up six new agriculture colleges in this area. The NE region states could be the capital of organic agriculture in the country”, he said.

Thwarted by police in Bangalore  Kiss of Love looks to broad baseitselfWritten by Harsha Raj Gatty | Bangalore |
Posted: December 1, 2014 2:11 pm | Updated: December 1, 2014 2:12 pm
Forbidden by the Bangalore police from holding a Kiss of Love protest on Sunday, on the lines of protests held in Kochi and Delhi against moral policing, a group of activists who rallied online support for the campaign are looking at a comeback at a later date to address a bouquet of issues apart from moral policing.
The Kiss of Love campaigners who have received support from human rights NGOs like Amnesty International will broad base its campaign to address issues surrounding the rights of women Lesbian, Gay, Bi-sexual, Transgender (LGBT) community members a core group of organizers of the proposed Kiss of Love event have stated.
“Many have misunderstood the intention of the campaign due to the prefix of the word ‘Kiss’. But in reality we are standing for liberty and freedom of the individual. Moreover the word kiss is a decent expression and not derogatory,” media coordinator for the Kiss of Love campaign K Vijayan said.
Threats from right-wing organizations and a lack of support from the city police have forced the campaigners to redraft their ‘protest plan’, he said. Meetings have been scheduled with various interest groups and NGOs across the state dealing with LGBT, women empowerment and human rights issues to discuss the way forward for the campaign. “Though we are clearly within our rights but we need to finalize our rebuttal to convince stakeholders such as state government and the police department,” Vijayan said.
The Bangalore police had last week refused to grant permission for the Kiss of Love protest in Bangalore. While the online campaigners were hoping to hold the protest despite the lack of formal police permission a court order to prevent the event from taking place – issued on the basis of a plea filed by an advocate – resulted in the police sending in troops to secure the Town Hall where the event was scheduled to be held on Sunday evening.
“We uphold the right to protest but it must be within the legal framework. Lip locking might be normal in Amsterdam but it is not part of our society. It might be seen as obscenity and might disturb the over all law and order situation,” police commissioner M N Reddi said. The police commissioner said his department had received a fresh appeal from the Kiss of Love campaigners for holding a protest in the city.
According to the Kiss of Love campaigners over 1000 people had agreed to take part in the event on Sunday. “The event is not limited to lovers and couples alone, even families are welcome. But if a husband and wife decide to get private we cannot refuse them the space. We must accept we are a changing society,” a KOL campaigner said.
The KOL members have also appealed to the police to look at the provisions of obscenity laws in the changing times. “Our culture is a composite and evolving one. Let us not continued…

The Indian squad’s decision not to travel to Brisbane led to speculation that the scheduled second test in Adelaide, from Dec. 12, might now open the series.
India’s decision to remain in Adelaide rather than move to Brisbane ahead of the delayed first cricket test against Australia fueled speculation Monday about a change of venues for the series—opening match.
The first test was due to begin at the Gabba on Thursday but Cricket Australia and the Board of Control for Cricket in India agreed on Sunday to postpone the start to allow Australian players to mourn the death of teammate Phil Hughes.
There was no indication from Cricket Australia on a new start date and the Indian squad’s decision not to travel to Brisbane led to speculation that the scheduled second test in Adelaide, from Dec. 12, might now open the series.
That was one of the scenarios available to officials who faced logistical dilemmas in rescheduling the Brisbane test and the series.
Cricket Australia now has to weigh a number of options in rescheduling the match, which will have to fit within a schedule unusually crowded because of the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in February and March.
Those options include delaying the Brisbane test by a matter of days, cancelling the match and making the Adelaide test the first in a series reduced to three matches, or trying to fit the Brisbane test into the schedule. Whatever decision it reaches will have to be approved by the BCCI.
The next round of matches in the Sheffield Shield competition, due to begin on Friday in Sydney, Perth and Hobart, are also likely to be postponed as players grieve. Hughes played for New South Wales before moving to South Australia. Players from both of those teams are expected to attend his funeral in Macksville, on the mid-north coast of New South Wales state.

Collecting evidence against black money offenders: GovtTata Steel close to reopening its top iron ore mine
Government is collecting evidence against those who have stashed black money abroad and the offenders will soon be punished, Communications and Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said today.
In an interview to news channel Aaj Tak’s show “Seedhi Baat,” he said that BJP in just five and half months has been able to achieve something which the Congress was unable to do in 10 years.
“We formed the SIT which Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi could not form in three years. Prime Minister Narendra Modi took up the issue of black money in G-20 and gave it an international colour and the entire world is today ready to cooperate on this issue.
“We have submitted the list of black money account holders to Supreme Court and SIT. In that 250 people have admitted that they have accounts in foreign banks. But for the sake of secrecy and to collect more evidence, we have not made the names public,” Prasad said.
In a statement issued by the channel, Prasad was quoted as saying that, “In just five and a half months, we have done that work which the Congress government could not do in ten years.”
He said that the government is collecting evidences and based on that, “we will soon send the criminals behind bars”.
When asked why his party is not having a discussion on the issue of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, the Minister said that Home Minister Rajnath Singh has already clarified that there will be a discussion on it, but Article 370 is not an election issue.
“Kashmir presently needs employment and good governance. Previous governments have deceived the Kashmiris. We have also said that three seats are reserved for Kashmiri Pandits. Talks are also going on to reserve seats for those Kashmiris displaced from Pakistan…
“The atmosphere in Kashmir is changing. People have chanted slogans like ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’ during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s rallies. People want a change in government. I think we would not have to compromise with any party – be it PDP or any other party,” the statement said quoting Prasad.

Xiaomi Redmi Note 3G review: Note this before youbuyWritten by Debashis Sarkar | New Delhi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 2:52 pm | Updated: December 3, 2014 1:22 pm
The Xiaomi Redmi Note is here and this phone too has an eye-popping spec sheet at a jaw-dropping price. However, before you line up virtually on Flipkart, note that this is a really large device and one that runs on the now dated Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean operating system. I played with the new Xiaomi phablet for five days before penning down this review.
Quick specs: 5.5-inch IPS display 720 x 1280 pixels | Android 4.3 OS with MIUI 5 | 1.7 GHz MediaTek MT 6592 octa-core CPU | Mali 450 GPU | 2GB RAM | 8GB internal memory expandable up to 32 GB | 13 MP rear camera | 5 MP front camera | Dual-SIM (regular SIM 3G+2G) | 3200 mAh battery
Box contents: Handset, USB cable and adapter.
Price: Rs 8,999
Design: The Redmi Note looks ordinary. After I unboxed the review unit, I was not sure this is something for which people will line up on Flipkart. However, at Rs 8,999, you really can’t expect more.
If you were lucky enough to get a glimpse of the previously launched Redmi 1S smartphone, then for you this phone will appear as an enlarged version of the same. For the rest, the Redmi Note will appear like just another smartphone made by any Indian brand.
The front face sports a 5.5-inch screen above three red coloured capacitive navigation buttons. On the top is a 5 MP camera and speaker. A white glossy plastic back cover hides two SIM card slots, a microSD slot and a removable 3,100 mAh battery inside.
The Redmi Note with a 5.5-inch display is obviously a large smartphone to carry. However, the rounded edge makes one-handed operability easy. Weighing 200 grams, the Redmi Note is a bit bulky too. The device is mostly made out of cheap glossy plastic but it feels solid in the hand.
Display: The Redmi Note sports a 5.5-inch 720p display with a pixel density of 267 ppi. The display is not Full HD but does a good job. It is clear and crisp. You shouldn’t have any reasons to complain about the display. The viewing angles are good. Outdoor visibility is surprising good at full brightness. At medium brightness, you will be able to operate the phone under direct sunlight without much difficulties.
Performance: The Redmi Note offers good performance at this price range. The octa-core MediaTek MT6592 (32 bit, frequency 728 ~ 1664 MHz) with Mali 450 GPU and 2GB RAM will not disappoint you at all. It scored a decent 31337 on AnTuTu Benchmark (v5.3 ). General performance of the phone was good. I did not witness any lags at all while opening apps or doing regular things. On the gaming front, the CPU again performs well. Overall, multimedia experience is good and will satisfy most. However, I witnessed a slight lag while watching movies through USB OTG. The phone does heats up while playing games, but this should not be a problem.

Software: The Redmi Note runs on Android 4.2.2 sugarcoated with MIUI 5. There is no official word as to when the device will be upgraded to Android 4.4 KitKat, if not Android 5.0 Lollipop. The MIUI 5 comes without any app drawer. So, everything is there on the home screen itself.
Android Wear is compatible with Android 4.3 or higher devices only. So, if you have any Android Wear-based device, it will not sync with the Redmi Note, at least now. On the app front, you will miss several new games, Quickoffice integration (which comes with KitKat) among several others. The MIUI 5 has a ‘Notes’ app, which seems like the only justification of the name Redmi Note.
The MIUI 5 makes Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean look better and easier too. The UI includes a Lite mode which makes it much easier for first time smartphone buyers and elderly non-techie users to use the phone.
For power users, Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean will be a big turn off. However, if you are not much into apps, then you can live with it and wait for an update. Note that majority of the Android users are still on Android 4.1 or 4.2 Jelly Bean.
Camera: This is one area Xiaomi has not compromised at all. For a phone priced at just Rs 8,999, I would say the camera is really good. It’s not the fastest but it will not disappoint you. The camera is capable of taking decent macro and HDR shots. Low light images without flash were surprisingly good. The 5 MP selfie camera is decent too.
Storage: The device offers around 6 GB of internal storage. MicroSD cards up to 32 GB are supported.
Connectivity: The smartphone comes with two regular SIM card slots. The first slot supports 3G while the Slot 2 supports only 2G networks. Overall, there is no issue with connectivity.
Picture gallery: Xiaomi Redmi Note
Battery: The 3100 mAh battery does a good job. The device easily lasts an entire day on normal usage. I managed to watch a 2.5-hour movie via USB OTG with just 16 per cent of battery life (medium brightness and data connection switched off). On the gaming front, two hours of continuous 3D gaming at full brightness and volume drained the battery from 75 per cent to 25 per cent. Overall, the battery life is good. However, the 3,100 mAh battery takes time to charge.
Verdict: The Xiaomi Redmi Note offers great value for money, no doubt. However, be sure about the size and obviously Android 4.2.2 OS, before buying. If you want a large-screened smartphone then this is the only option under Rs 10,000.

Nigeria: Suspected Boko Haram attack DamaturucityBy: Associated Press | Bauchi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 2:28 pm | Updated: December 1, 2014 6:28 pm
Suspected Islamic extremists struck two state capitals in northeast Nigeria on Monday, with twin blasts at a crowded market in Maiduguri and explosions and gunfire hitting Damaturu. In Maiduguri rescue workers were trying to evacuate the dead and wounded from the market, the same one where two female suicide bombers killed at least 70 people a week ago, said trader Bala Dauda.
“I can’t say how many were killed or injured but I have seen very many victims dripping with blood, others with parts of their bodies dismembered by the blasts,” Dauda told The Associated Press by telephone. Monday’s blasts also were caused by “two girls,” said witness Mallam Muhammadu. Police spokesman Gideon Jubrin said it’s too early to give a toll.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the Maiduguri blasts but people blamed Boko Haram, the Islamic extremist group that has carried out many such attacks in a 5-year insurgency that has killed thousands and forced hundreds of thousands from their homes.
In Damaturu, explosions and gunfire erupted before dawn on Monday causing some residents to flee into the bush and others to cower in their homes. Damaturu, the provincial capital of Yobe state, is some 135 kilometers (85 miles) west of Maiduguri, which is the capital of Borno state.
The militants targeted a rapid-response police base on the outskirts of Damaturu, said resident Garba Musa. “It has been burned down completely,” he said. The Defense Ministry headquarters said a fighter jet was repelling the attackers.
A helicopter gunship was hovering over the town. “We are still under fire,” Premium Times news website quoted Yobe state police Commissioner Marcus Danladi as saying. “Kindly sympathize with us. There is nothing I can tell you now.”
Civil servant Abdullahi Abba said his family was hiding in the bush. “We’ve been hearing these gunshots and bombs since the early hours and felt unsafe staying at home.” He said they hoped to trek to the nearby town of Tarmuwa. We don’t know where to hide, the shooting is all over … We are running for our lives,” said resident Musa Abbas.
The attacks on the two state capitals show an acceleration of the extremist violence in northeastern Nigeria. Boko Haram, the West African’s nation’s homegrown Islamic extremist group, has been striking with increased frequency and deadliness since the military declared the insurgents had agreed to a ceasefire in September.
On Friday, bomb blasts and gunfire killed more than 100 people praying at the main mosque in northern Kano, Nigeria’s second largest city. Boko Haram is holding a couple dozen continued…

Free fall: Gold tumbles after Swiss referendum  oil hits 5-yr lowBank of Japan
(The slide in the oil and commodity…)
TOKYO: Gold prices tumbled on Monday after Swiss voters overwhelmingly rejected proposals to boost gold reserves in a referendum, joining a broad rout in commodities that sent copper and oil prices to four- and five-year lows.
The slide in the oil and commodity prices is hurting many assets tied to the resource sector - from Australian mining shares to the Malaysian ringgit.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.9 per cent , hitting six-week lows.
US stock futures also slipped 0.4 per cent , though some market players think the fall could stem partly from disappointing sales at the start of the US holiday shopping season last Friday.
European stocks are expected to fall, with Germany's DAX and France's CAC40 seen shedding 0.6 per cent .
Gold fell more than two per cent at one point to $1,142.90 per ounce, its lowest level in more than three weeks, while silver was also hit, falling more than six per cent to a five-year low below $14.50 per ounce.
The Swiss gold reserves proposal, had it been approved, would have compelled the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to more than double its gold reserves and banned it from ever selling the metal, threatening its ability to defend a 1.20 euro cap on the Swiss franc imposed at the height of the euro zone crisis.
The Swiss franc dipped to 1.2042 on the euro from 1.2018 at the end of last week, though the Swiss currency is supported by investors who still regard it as one of the safest currencies in the world. It last stood at 1.2040.
"The result should of course temporarily relieve the pressure on the SNB's currency floor, albeit whilst doing little or nothing in our opinion to reverse the fundamental downward trajectory of EUR/CHF," said JPMorgan analyst Paul Meggyesi.
Oil prices hit five-year lows, unable to find a bottom despite their biggest fall in 2 1/2 years last week after OPEC held back from cutting output in the face of a supply glut.
US crude briefly fell more than three per cent to a five-year low of $64.10 per barrel, with the fall from June exceeding 40 per cent . It last stood at $64.56, down 2.4 per cent .
Adding fuel to the fire, Saudi Arabia's oil minister told fellow OPEC members last week that they must combat the US shale oil boom.
 
"They (OPEC) can get by at $60 a barrel, but that price would knock out a fair whack of the competition - much of US shale oil for example - as well as put investment in future capacity growth firmly on the back-burner," ANZ analysts said in a note. "They're playing the long game, banking that others can't."
Copper also fell to as low as $6,230.75, piercing through its March low to hit its lowest levels since mid-2010. It last stood at $6,245.50, down 1.7 per cent .
The Australian dollar fell more than one per cent to a four-year low of $0.8417 as did the Malaysian ringgit, which fell to 3.437 to the dollar.
Adding salt to commodities' wounds, Chinese official manufacturing data suggested growth is slowing in China, demand from which has supported commodity prices for years.
Sliding oil and raw material prices have stirred deflation fears in the euro zone and Japan, cementing expectations that the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan will take more steps to support their respective economies.
The dollar, taking advantage of such concerns, attracted bids against the euro and yen.
The euro was slightly weaker at $1.2449 after having fallen on Friday on news that annual inflation in the euro zone cooled to a five-year low of 0.3 per cent in November.
Many traders expect the ECB may signal further action later this week to ward off deflation.
The dollar also hit a seven-year high of 119.03 yen and the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, rose to 88.451, a four-year high.
"Given that the Fed is going to raise rates next year, the monetary policy divergence should support the dollar," said Osao Iizuka, the head of FX trading at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank.
The yen's fall and lower commodity prices helped Japanese shares, with the Nikkei posting 0.8 per cent gains to close at seven-year high.

SINGAPORE: Oil fell more than $2 a barrel to a five-year low in Asian trade on Monday, extending a steep sell-off after OPEC decided not to cut production last week, keeping markets well supplied.
Both U.S. crude and Brent have fallen for five straight months, oil's longest losing streak since the 2008 financial crisis.
"Just when the market was thinking that a 4-year low for crude oil was bad enough, we have hit a 5-year low after the OPEC meeting," Phillip Futures analysts said in a note.
U.S. crude tumbled to near $64, dragging Brent down below $70, after Saudi Arabia's oil minister told fellow OPEC members last week that they must combat the U.S. shale oil boom.
"They (OPEC) can get by at $60 a barrel, but that price would knock out a fair whack of the competition - much U.S. shale oil for example - as well as put investment in future capacity growth firmly on the back-burner," ANZ analysts said in a note.
"They're playing the long game, banking that others can't."
Brent hit a low of $67.82 a barrel, the lowest since October 2009, and was down $1.71 at $68.44 a barrel by 0733 GMT. U.S. crude fell $1.49 to $64.66 a barrel, after earlier slipping to an intraday low of $64.10, the lowest since July 2009.
Oil-producing countries from Iraq to Nigeria are revising their 2015 budgets to reflect lower prices.
Iran refrained from protesting against OPEC's decision to retain its production ceiling to maintain group solidarity, even though the move will not benefit all members, Iranian oil minister said in local media reports.
Slower than expected growth in China's manufacturing sector may add further downward pressure on oil. China's official Purchasing Managers' Index ( PMI ) slipped to 50.3 in November, a government study showed on Monday, lower than analysts' forecasts of 50.6.
"It's not too bad a miss, but probably won't help (oil) too much," Ric Spooner, chief analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney said.
"It's best not to try to pick bottoms at this stage."
Spooner said the next support levels for Brent are at $68 and $64 a barrel. If West Texas Intermediate crude futures fall below $63.90 a barrel, the next support level would be at $50, he said.

China mulls first press law to improve newscoverageBy: Press Trust of India | Beijing |
Posted: December 1, 2014 3:03 pm
China plans to introduce its first press law to enable the state controlled media to make a greater impact after years of clamour by experts. Liu Binjie, the former director of the defunct General Administration of Press and Publication, said that new media outlets have been carrying eye-catching stories with relatively more independence and rapidly expanding influence, while traditional media outlets are still being managed under strict rules that limited their impact.
A press law would end the imbalance, he said. “A press law would lay out the legal, moral and social boundaries for media. “It would also allow the media more discretion in their reporting under the legal framework,” Liu was quoted as saying by state-run Global Times.
Almost all of the media in China is state controlled or functioned under the state’s effective supervision. While the contours of the media expanded due to pressure from social media, recent report say that media regulations have been tightened under the new leadership. Chinese scholars and lawyers have been calling for a press law for over a decade. Incidents of journalists being beaten were frequently reported.
Meanwhile, some reporters’ unethical behavior such as charging companies for positive coverage has also been punished, the report said. Authorities are also considering greater protection for the intellectual property rights of news products, said Liu. Online news portals will have to pay for information and original stories uploaded to the platform before reposting them, the Shandong-based Dazhong Daily reported.

Shweta Basu Prasad is now script consultant for Anurag KashyapscompanyBy: BollywoodHungama.com | Mumbai |
Posted: December 1, 2014 3:02 pm
Actress Shweta Basu Prasad, lately in the eye of a storm over her involvement in an ambivalent social situation, seems to have made peace with the scandal and moved on to rebuild her life. The latest step in Shweta’s process of healing is a job as a script consultant with the Phantom production house which is helmed by Madhu Mantena, Anurag Kashyap, Vikas Bahl and Vikramaditya Motwani.
Says Shweta, “Yes, I am a script consultant at Phantom. I am essentially a curator there, assigned the job of going through potentially promising scripts. It’s a job I like doing as it is helping me to grow as an actor when I read the scripts.”
Shweta says this job remains until she resumes her acting career. She dismisses reports that she has been signed by Hansal Mehta. “I came across a report that I had been signed for a documentary by Mr Mehta. How can I play a role in a documentary? The person who wrote this obviously has no clue what he was talking about,” laughs Shweta.
She does admit meeting Hansal to show him her documentary. “I’ve made a documentary entitled Roots on Hindustani classical music. I took it to show it to Mr Hansal Mehta. His son Jay was also there in his office. They seemed to like my effort. Beyond that there is nothing. Mr Mehta has not offered me a role.”
Adds Hansal Mehta, “Shweta’s documentary on Hindustani classical music which I saw, is proof of her talent. I am most certainly going to work with her. But I haven’t decided on the project.”

Sensex takes a hit as Moody s cuts Japan to A1; top 20 trading ideasApollo Tyres Ltd
(At 11:40 a.m.; the 50-share…)
NEW DELHI: NEW DELHI: The S&P BSE Sensex pared gains and was trading in the red after rising as much as 116 points in trade on Monday, as Moody's Investors Service downgraded Japan's sovereign debt rating by one notch to A1 from Aa3, citing heightening uncertainty over the country's ability to hit its debt-reduction goal.
The announcement briefly sent the yen to a seven-year low against the dollar and pushed 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) futures down by 10 ticks.
The US rating agency said the outlook was stable.
Tracking the momentum, the 50-share Nifty index which rose to its record high of 8623 earlier in trade came off from its highs, led by losses in Jindal Steel, NMDC, Tata Power , Sesa Sterlite and BHEL.

Expos: Robert Vadra  family guilty  says Prashant Bhushan  slams Jet AirwaysGovt extends olive branch to Kalanithi Maran's Spicejet, allows ticket bookings for next 3 months
Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Prashant Bhushan today accused Robert Vadra, son-in-law of Congress President Sonia Gandhi, of being guilty of misuse of power as he got upgrades on international sectors for himself and his family on Jet Airways flights.
“He (Robert Vadra) is clearly guilty of using his position and proximity to a powerful family in getting these free upgrades to his family,” he told reporters here.
Tehelka Magazine claimed yesterday that some officials, bureaucrats and other VIPs had “abused” their status to get free tickets and other facilities from a private airline in gross violation of service rules and propriety.
Bhushan also rapped the airline for giving these kind of upgrades to Vadra and other influential persons. “It is also the fault of the airlines which has been doing this. They should not be allowing such sort of misuse of power and proximity to a powerful family,” he said.
“This only shows the kind of low moral standards of Vadra and the officials of the airline for upgrading him and his family without any charges,” he said.
The magazine had alleged that Vadra had got several upgrades on international sectors for himself, one of his associates and his children and his mother.

Petrol Price Cut by 91 Paise Per Litre, Diesel by 84 Paise
Press Trust of India | Updated On: November 30, 2014 21:23 (IST)
BofA-ML Sees 0.25% Rate Cut in February on Easing Inflation
New Delhi: Petrol price was on Sunday slashed by 91 paise per litre - its seventh reduction since August, while that of diesel was reduced by 84 paise, its third straight cut, as international oil rates continued to slump.
The revised prices will be effective from the midnight of November 30 and December 1, Indian Oil Corp announced here.
In Delhi, petrol will cost Rs 63.33 a litre as compared to Rs 64.24 per litre previously and in Mumbai, it will cost Rs 70.95 per litre - a reduction of 96 paise.
Diesel will cost Rs 52.51 a litre in Delhi from Monday as against Rs 53.35 until now while in Mumbai, the price will be cut by 93 paise to Rs 60.11.
Rates differ from state to state due to differential local sales tax or VAT.
This is the seventh consecutive reduction in petrol prices since August and third in diesel rates since October. Prior to Sunday's reduction, petrol price has been lowered by a cumulative Rs 9.36 per litre since August.
(Read: How diesel price deregulation impacts you )
"Since the last price changes, the international prices of both petrol and diesel have continued to be on a downtrend. The rupee-dollar exchange rate has however appreciated since the last price change. The combined impact of both these factors warrant a decrease in retail selling prices of both petrol and diesel," IOC, the country's largest fuel retailer, said in a statement.
"The movement of prices in international oil market and rupee-dollar exchange rate shall continue to be closely monitored and developing trends of the market will be reflected in future price changes," the statement said.
Rates would have been cut by Rs 1.50 on November 16 but the government took away the gains by way of an excise duty increase.
Excise duty on normal or unbranded petrol was hiked from Rs 1.20 per litre to Rs 2.70 per litre and unbranded diesel from Rs 1.46 a litre to Rs 2.96. The same on branded petrol was raised from Rs 2.35 a litre to Rs 3.85 and on branded diesel from Rs 3.75 to Rs 5.25 per litre.
While the fall in global rates and the resultant cuts in retail prices have led to loss of revenue to the exchequer, particularly state governments, there was not any loss to the central government on account of reduction in petrol and diesel prices as excise duty on the two fuel is fixed and not ad valorem.
The increase in excise duty would result in an additional revenue of Rs 13,000 crore for the government.
State-owned fuel retailers Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp (HPCL) follow the fortnightly review practice and change rates on 1st and 16th of every month.
Oil firms revise rates of petrol, which was deregulated in June 2010, and diesel on the 1st and 16th of every month based on average international oil price and rupee-dollar exchange rate.
Falling for the fifth straight week, the rupee, which plays an important role in determining the prices of the imported fuels, ended lower at 62.02 against dollar on Friday. ( Read more )

World AIDS Day: Campaigners say pandemic has finally reached tipping pointprint
The world has finally reached "the beginning of the end" of the AIDS pandemic that has infected and killed millions in the past 30 years, according to a leading campaign group fighting HIV.
The number of people newly infected with HIV over the last year was lower than the number of HIV-positive people who joined those getting access to the medicines they need to take for life to keep AIDS at bay.
But in a report to mark World AIDS Day on December 1, the ONE campaign, an advocacy group working to end poverty and preventable disease in Africa, warned that reaching this milestone did not mean the end of AIDS was around the corner.

"We've passed the tipping point in the AIDS fight at the global level, but not all countries are there yet, and the gains made can easily stall or unravel," said Erin Hohlfelder, ONE's director of global health policy.
The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS is spread via blood, semen and breast milk. There is no cure for the infection, but AIDS can be kept at bay for many years with cocktails of antiretroviral drugs.
United Nations data show that in 2013, 35 million people were living with HIV, 2.1 million people were newly infected with the virus and some 1.5 million people died of AIDS.
By far the greatest part of the HIV/AIDS burden is in sub-Saharan Africa. The AIDS pandemic began more than 30 years ago and has killed up to 40 million people worldwide.
The United Nations AIDS agency, UNAIDS, says that, by June 2014, some 13.6 million people globally had access to AIDS drugs, a dramatic improvement on the 5 million who were getting treatment in 2010.
"Despite the good news, we should not take a victory lap yet," said Hohlfelder. She highlighted several threats to current progress, including a $3 billion shortfall in the funds needed each year to control HIV around the world.
"We want to see bold new funding from a more diversified base, including more from African domestic budgets," she said.
ONE also noted that HIV is increasingly concentrated among hard-to-reach populations such as injecting drug users, gay men and sex workers - groups who are often stigmatised and have trouble accessing treatment and prevention services.

Banish hopes for Dec 2; fat rate cut coming in Apr: Experts08:00 am
Reserve Bank (RBI) Governor Raghuram Rajan will resist a rate-cut tomorrow as he would want to assess real impact of the sharp slide in crude oil prices and base impact on inflation, says Jahangir Aziz of JP Morgan. He sees first rate cut, and a sizeable one that too, coming in April 2015.
Citi' global market head Bhanu Vohra totally agrees with Aziz. He adds even with a rate cut, yields won't do down sub 7 percent for the next one year.
Below is the verbatim transcript of Jahangir Aziz and Bhanu Vohra’s interview:
Q: What is the spin on what the RBI governor might do? There is a compelling feeling with global commodity prices moving south, the pressure on domestic inflation is only going to recede next year so why should he wait, what is your sense?
Aziz: Clearly, it is a big event, in fact, the USD 25-30 per barrel reduction in oil is probably the biggest event as far as inflation, disinflationary pressures globally and growth is concerned in India.
What we haven’t really seen so far is a sense that that has actually translated into other variables to high purchasing power, consumers reacting to that, better corporate margins and corporates reacting to that. So we haven’t really seen that. The only thing we have actually seen is tumbling in inflation but even if you look at that, I think much of the decline in inflation has come from the decline in food inflation more than that in crude oil prices and because growth has been slow. So to say that because oil is probably going to average around USD 80/barrel in 2015 therefore the battle against inflation is over and therefore the 6 percent January 2016 target is now assured, that is a bit too premature.
Q: So when are you expecting the first rate cut?
Aziz: My guess is that you could see tomorrow the RBI relenting and giving us a 25 bps rate cut. But my guess is that the RBI is probably going to wait, it is going to wait for two reasons, one is that there is a base effect on the other direction coming into play in the months of December, January and February. They would like to see how big or how bad that is. They would also like to see where exactly does oil price flow, we do expect oil price to continue to fall in Q1 of 2015.
Then there is the Budget, does the government manage to meet its 4.1 percent target and what is the budget for the next year, what are the reforms that will happen in the winter session of parliament and more importantly I think this is where the critical problem is, is the decline in food inflation structural or is this something against cyclical and we will again be very rudely surprised back in January, February and March. I think the RBI will want to wait, see all of those events actually unfold, where things stand and my sense therefore is that in April is when they actually do their first rate cut but the rate cut is unlikely to be just 25 bps, it will probably go with the very decisive 50 bps of rate cut.
Q: What is your treasury going with tomorrow?
Vohra: We have consensus that we do not see a rate cut tomorrow. But having said that, clearly it is a very difficult task because there is merit in saying that there is time for us to watch inflation little more before we put a finger on the rate cut. One is in order, whether it is post March, post the budget immediately it is difficult to say but we would go with a 50 bps cut towards the next year.
Q: If that were to happen how will the yields react tomorrow? If he doesn’t cut do you expect him to change his language in some fashion? In any case what will you be prepared with in terms of bond movement tomorrow and thereafter?
Vohra: See bonds have rallied already, we see a number of 8.04 right now. Till the time rate cut happens and till the time repo remains where it is I do not think that yields going below 8 percent is very much likely. So we would be positioned very square as far as tomorrow is concerned but yes there is clearly a move for yields to track downwards. We would put a number of 7.95-8 in the coming few weeks but that is just about it till the time a rate cut happens and we have far more clarity.
The other thing we have to be very careful about is the Fed changing its stance on a very regular basis. We have to keep seeing very actively on when does really Fed start hiking. Now the consensus has moved towards year end than it was at the start of the year. So those two things would be important really.
Q: What is your trajectory as far as GDP is concerned because as we go forth we might see the agri growth peter off because of the weak kharif. We might also see the government spending go down as the government reduces its expenditure to meet its targets. Do you think this 5.3 percent number can sustain, what is the expectation in Q3 and Q4?
Aziz: The 5.3 number surprises on the upside. We were actually expecting something below 5 exactly for the reasons that you described that we did not expect government expenditure to be so strong and we did not expect agriculture to be so strong given the fact that we still have a deficient monsoon. So chances are that in Q3 and Q4 of the fiscal year, you will see pay back both on the government expenditure front which has to be tightened significantly to meet the 4.1 percent target even though there has been a significant windfall from lower oil prices and agriculture given the fact that there was deficit monsoon, should also slow down.
So we don’t really see the trajectory moving up. I think critical in all of this, there are two things that it is very difficult at this point in time to ascertain. One is the fact that Indian corporates have really been not very convinced by what the government has done over the last six months. If you look at investment, investment growth again turn negative in the last quarter, IIP numbers languishing, credit growth is near all time lows. So we don’t really see very much coming out from the corporate sector.
The one big uncertainty is that this very large increase in purchasing power by Indian households, what do they do with that? Do they save it or do they start spending it? If there is some spending out of that, that is the Indian household start believing that this decline in oil prices is here to stay, my guess is that you might get some upwards movement or support from consumption but it is really hard to see this trajectory move up in the near term.
Q: So even if the monetary cycle reverses, it starts to reverse now, do you think there will be any significant uptick to the private sector?
Aziz: There has been a significant increase in real interest rates, which is undoubtedly the case because mechanically inflation has fallen. But this decline in inflation is a good thing. It is not happening because core inflation is going up, it is going down because input prices are falling which means that the corporate sector must be enjoying a much bigger margin today than it was three months back because of the low inflation. So what it is losing in terms of higher real interest rate it is gaining significantly in terms of lower input prices.
So it isn’t exactly clear that the biding constrain to corporate investment is high real interest rate. I mean people will point to that and say that look interest rates now in real terms 300 bps higher than six months back but so is corporate margins because input prices have fallen significantly. So my guess is that cutting down interest rates will help in the margin, will improve sentiment, will give a signal that the RBI is confident that inflation can come down to 6 percent in a year’s time but does it move the needle for the corporate sector, very hard to say.
Q: One thing is very clear, RBI is clearly confident on the current account front, which is why they have removed all quantitative restrictions on gold. How do you read it as a rupee dealer? Where is the rupee headed?
Vohra: Rupee has remained sideways as I remember saying a few months ago as well, we see the sideways move continuing. If you see rupee volatility, it is in lowest digits we have ever seen. So that sideways move will continue, we do hold a view still that there is slightly negative rupee bias. So where do we put rupee, probably three months or one year down from now, I think it would still remain sideways probably near 62/USD.
There are two-three things that are pushing the rupee to where it is right now. One is lack of volatility. We see good bids and offers from nationalised banks at all levels. Number two, look at all other Asians, you look at even Singapore dollar now at close to 1.32, all other Asians have depreciated. So it is very difficult for rupee to remain just where it is right now so I think we will drift slightly higher going forward.
The gold move is a very welcome thing but I think it has lot of other objectives to achieve. We have seen a lot of news around how gold is coming into the country and so on. This is a perfect setting, you see crude where it is and look at India’s dependence upon crude. So this move is not going to really impact rupee very negatively, we saw rupee opening at 62.16 today as it is trailing right now, that is where it will stay. We don’t believe much to happen at all in the coming few months.
Q: What happens if there indeed is a rate cut tomorrow and a year down the line where do you see the 10-year yield?
Vohra: Tomorrow if there is a rate cut I do not think that the market entirely is positioned as such. 10-15 bps is already priced into the market because it is a fatal event so I would see yields probably going down to 7.90-7.95, nothing more than that. As far as currency markets are concerned I just told you that the sideways move is what will continue, there is not much that is going to happen in the coming data events also.
As far as one year is concerned that is a tricky question to answer at this stage, we will have to be very careful of where gold is, where oil is and what the RBI stance is. The commentary is going to be very important, how dovish they are and what exactly do they think about inflation. If I were to take a guess I would take a number of 7.85 or so because a lot of data points needs to be considered.

In political leapfrog  Tabare Vazquez wins Uruguay presidential runoffBy: Associated Press | Montevideo |
Posted: December 1, 2014 9:51 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 11:39 am
Tabare Vazquez’s victory in Uruguay’s presidential election is a show of support for the leftist coalition that has governed the country for the past decade and allows the government to proceed with its plan to create the world’s first state-run marijuana marketplace.
Vazquez, a 74-year-old oncologist who was president from 2005 to 2010, topped center-right rival Luis Lacalle Pou of the National Party 53 percent to 40 percent in Sunday’s vote.
The runoff vote drew international attention after Lacalle Pou promised to undo much of the pioneering plan to put the government in charge of regulating the production, distribution and sale of marijuana on a nationwide scale. Vazquez, meanwhile, said he would proceed with it, unless it produced negative results.
As results came in, Lacalle Pou called Vazquez to concede and wish him “great success,” while supporters of Vazquez’s Broad Front coalition poured into the streets to celebrate.
In his victory speech, Vazquez called on the opposition to join him in a national accord to deal with the issues of public security, health and education. “I want to be able to count on all Uruguayans, but not so they follow me, so they guide me, accompany me.”
Sunday’s win marked a reversal of roles for Vazquez, who shook up Uruguayan politics when he became president the first time, peacefully ending 170 years of two-party dominance. In his first presidential campaign, Vazquez promised changes that would “shake the roots of the trees.” But he governed as a relatively cautious moderate, avoiding the constitutional changes and polarization that have shaken countries such as Venezuela.
His popularity on leaving office paved the way for the election of his successor, current President Jose Mujica, a former guerrilla known for his humble lifestyle and straight talk. Both men belong to the Broad Front coalition, which has been in power for a decade and has passed laws same-sex marriage, abortion and marijuana.
This time around, Mujica’s popularity and a strong economy helped propel Vazquez into office, where he is now seen as the candidate of continuity, not of change.
Javier Silva, an operator at a state electrical plant, said he voted for Vazquez because he thinks the country is doing well.
“The economy is rising. The country isn’t anything like it was 10 or 20 years ago, when it was in decline,” said the 35-year-old.
Monica Centurion, an official at a state hospital, said she voted for Lacalle Pou because of his pledge to improve public security, which “is the principal issue.”
Vazquez immediately moved to calm fears that he would introduce radical change in his second term.
“Within the Constitution and the law everything. Outside the Constitution and the law nothing,” he told party militants after his win was announced.
Lacalle Pou is the son of another ex-president, Luis Alberto Lacalle Herrera, who governed from 1990 to 1995.
During his campaign, he criticized the marijuana plan, saying he continued…

Seoul: South Korea's Samsung Electronics plans to launch a new sub-$100 smartphone running on its own Tizen operating system in India later this month, South Korea's Maeil Business Newspaper said on Monday.
The paper, a local business daily, said Samsung will hold a press conference on December 10 to launch its first Tizen smartphone, to be called the Z1. A Samsung Electronics spokeswoman declined to comment.
Samsung had initially planned to launch a Tizen smartphone in Russia in the third quarter but scrapped the plan. The firm said at the time that it wanted to further enhance the ecosystem behind Tizen. Only a handful of devices, including the firm's smartwatch products, currently run on the platform.
Samsung's push to develop its own operating system is part of efforts to reduce dependence on Google's Android, but delays in product launches have undercut expectations.

Will try to bring GST Bill in Parl session: JaitleyComments
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Monday expressed hope that the much-awaited GST Bill, which provides for a uniform indirect tax structure, would be introduced in the current winter session of Parliament.
"We will try and introduce GST (goods and services tax) Bill in this session...GST Bill would be taken up by the cabinet after empowered committee (of state finance minister) meeting on December 12," he said.
The government has proposed to implement GST from April 1, 2016, and the new finance commission may be set up ahead of its schedule to look into the issues related to the new indirect tax regime.
The GST will subsume indirect taxes like excise duty and service tax at the central level and VAT on the states front, besides local levies.
There are differences between the Centre and states on some issues with regard to the implementation of GST that includes the revenue neutral rate and keeping petroleum, liquor out of the ambit.
While a sub-committee on GST has suggested that the revenue neutral rate of GST be pegged at about 27%, the states are yet to decide on it.
It had suggested states GST at 13.91% and Central GST at 12.77%. Besides, states have been demanding that petroleum, alcohol and tobacco should be kept out of the purview of GST.
The GST Constitutional Amendment Bill, which was introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2011, had lapsed and the NDA government will be required to come up with a fresh bill.
The GST rollout has missed several deadlines because of lack of consensus among states over certain crucial issues on the new tax regime.

Ageing Europe needs the migrants it doesn t wantAgeing Europe needs the migrants it doesn't want
Reuters
print
Europe is ageing faster than any other region of the world. It badly needs immigrants. But many Europeans don't want them.
The "old continent" may be able to offset the impact of a greying workforce until around 2020 by bringing more women and elderly people into work, encouraging mobility within Europe and making better use of existing migrants, EU and OECD experts say.
But in the medium to long term, the European Union will need to attract significant numbers of skilled workers from beyond its borders - and overcome growing public opposition highlighted by the rise of populist anti-immigration parties.
"If you close the door (to immigration), you will pay an economic price," says Jean-Christophe Dumont, an expert on migration at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, a Paris-based intergovernmental think-tank.
"For now, we can make better use of migrants who are already here, matching their skills better to labour market needs. In the longer term, it will not only be about matching skills, it will also be about numbers," he said.
Going by current trends, Europe's industrial powerhouse Germany, along with Spain and Poland, will see its population shrink from now on, slowing potential economic growth.
Germany's 82 million residents will dwindle to 74.7 million by 2050 and their average age will rise to nearly 50, assuming unchanged levels of migration, according to EU statistics agency Eurostat. Some projections are even more dire, putting the German population as low as 65 million by 2060.
That will mean "serious labour supply constraints" in some of the strongest EU economies - Austria, the Netherlands and Finland as well as Germany - according to a European Commission study by Joerg Peschner and Constantinos Fotakis that took a baseline economic recovery of just 1%.
By contrast, Britain, France, Ireland and to a lesser extent Italy can expect healthy expansion. Britain will have overtaken the Germans by 2050 as the EU's most populous nation with 77.2 million - if it stays in the bloc - while France will have caught up with Germany on 74.3 million.
Regardless of their place on the scale, many European countries still recovering from six years of economic crisis are being tugged in the opposite direction from demographic realities by a tide of anti-immigration political rhetoric.
Marine Le Pen in France, Nigel Farage in Britain and Geert Wilders in the Netherlands are attracting working-class voters by raging against freedom of movement of workers within the EU, from the poorer east and south to the wealthier north.
They accuse the EU of opening the flood gates to "job stealing" migrants, driving down wages and living standards and raising crime rates.

Demographics drive demand
The backlash against immigration prompted Pope Francis to appeal in the European Parliament for an "elderly and haggard" continent to show a more welcoming face to those who cross the Mediterranean Sea in search of a better life.
Another pressing argument for rational debate is the growing impact of the demographic reversal on the funding of pensions and healthcare, especially in countries such as Germany and Spain which will have the oldest populations.
As the post-World War Two baby boom generation retires, the ratio of over-65-year-olds to the working age population is set to rise dramatically, while the number of under-15s declines by nearly 15 percent by 2060, according to projections by Eurostat.
At present, the age dependence rate is 27.5 on average in the 28-nation EU, but Germany and Italy are well above that level. The rate is projected to jump to 49.4 in 2050, when there will be only two people of working age for every retiree.
Most EU countries have raised their retirement age to 65 or beyond and are making citizens contribute longer for a full pension - but further increases lie ahead.
Meanwhile there's the impact on Europe's economy of having a big chunk of the population focused on "needs, rather than wants," to consider, as Paul Hodges, co-author of the e-book "Boom, Gloom and The New Normal", explains.
"Demographics drive demand," he said. "Older people have less need for houses, cars and consumer goods and have to make do on lower incomes as they move on to pension age, slowing the wheels of the economy."
Before the financial crisis erupted in 2008, economic growth in the euro zone averaged 2 percent a year, roughly made up of a 1 percent gain in employment and 1 percent in productivity.
That growth potential, regarded as necessary to maintain the current level of European welfare provision, collapsed during the crisis and has yet to return in most countries.
Without employment gains from migration, Europe will need an improbably big boost in productivity to sustain its living standards - or see them decline.

TMC targets Amit Shah  alleges he has links with Sahara caseComments
Trinamool Congress on Monday launched an offensive on the Bharatiya Janata Party in Parliament and held a rally in Kolkata to counter the saffron party president Amit Shah's criticism of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Sunday.
Facing heat over the Saradha scam, Trinamool targeted the BJP inside as well as outside Parliament by alleging that a diary of jailed Sahara group chief Subrata Roy contained the name of a senior leader of the saffron party, leading to clashes and a walkout.
Placard-wielding Trinamool MPs held a demonstration outside Parliament demanding a probe into alleged links between Shah and the Sahara money laundering case.
Trinamool sought to corner the ruling party in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha by displaying symbolic red diaries.
The Trinamool members alleged the diary was recovered from Sahara chief Subrata Roy by the Central Bureau of Investigation during searches at Sahara's office and claimed it contained the name of a BJP leader.
Attack in Parliament
In Lok Sabha, Trinamool MPs rushed to the Well shouting slogans, carrying red-coloured diaries which had "Sahara" written on it. They demanded that PM Modi should explain what action the CBI has taken after the name allegedly figured in the diary. They later staged a walkout.
Bandyopadhyay had given a notice for suspension of Question Hour to discuss the issue which was rejected by Speaker Sumitra Mahajan.
"They (Trinamool MPs) have decided not to follow the rules," she said.
Parliamentary affairs minister M Venkaiah Naidu said according to rules no member can name anyone who is not a member of the House. They also cannot display placards, he said.
To this, the Speaker said the name of the BJP leader would not go on record.
After protesting for a few minutes, the Trinamool MPs staged a walkout.
Minister of state for home affairs Kiren Rijiju, however, denied the presence of the "red diary".
"These are political allegations. There is no truth in it. No such diary was recovered," Rijiju told reporters in Delhi.
Later, BJP member Kirit Somaiya hit back, alleging that the Trinamool government in West Bengal was creating "hurdles" in the CBI investigation into the Saradha chit fund scam, in which names of "one dozen" Trinamool leaders have cropped up.
This led to protests by Trinamool members but Somaiya went on saying that 3.5 lakh small investors had been cheated in the chit fund scheme.
"The state government is not cooperating with the CBI probe," he alleged.
Amid noisy scenes, the Speaker adjourned the House for lunch, ahead of schedule.
In Rajya Sabha, Trinamool's Derek O'Brien sought to raise the issue during Zero Hour and Question Hour but was disallowed.
He had earlier given a notice for suspension of Question Hour but was not allowed.
As O'Brien rose to raise the issue during Question Hour, BJP members shouted him down by raising the issue of Saradha chit fund scam.
The members flashed symbolic red diaries with Sahara written on them, and tried to storm the well of the upper house as well to press their demand.
Trinamool members later staged a walkout as they were disallowed from raising the issue.
Counter-rally in Kolkata
Mamata Banerjee's nephew and Diamond Harbour Lok Sabha MP, Abhisekh Banerjee, said the West Bengal chief minister does not want to respond to Shah as she believes "he is not of her stature".
Mamata cancelled an appearance at the rally held by Abhishek to counter Shah's allegations levelled against her by Shah.
Speaking almost from the same spot where Shah delivered his Sunday speech, Abhisekh attacked the BJP and PM Modi saying he has done nothing for West Bengal after coming to power.
Abhisekh mocked Modi by comparing him with his aunt saying while he flies in private jets, goes abroad and changes wardrobe frequently, Mamata stays in a small house, wears handloom sarees and chappals.
Without naming Shah, he said those who come to Bengal like migratory birds, address a rally and return to Delhi will not win elections in the state.
Abhisekh also alleged Union minister of law and justice Sadanand Gowda's assets jumped from Rs. 9 crore to Rs. 20 crore in three months, and BJP must explain it.
Shah on Sunday had sounded the poll bugle to oust Trinamool from the state in the 2015 Kolkata Municipal Corporation and 2016 assembly elections and called for a Trinamool-free Bengal.
The BJP's rise in Bengal has sparked speculations about new equations in the state's political arena where the saffron brigade was only a fringe player until recently.
However, banking on Modi's poll promises on development, the party bagged an impressive 16.8% vote share in the April-May Lok Sabha elections. Even though the BJP won just two of the 42 seats, it made an impact.
Frequent clashes between BJP and Trinamool supporters have been reported in West Bengal since the polls.
The BJP chief's address came at a time when the ruling Trinamool is reeling under graft allegations in the multi-crore Saradha chit fund scam and the Burdwan blasts on October 2 that killed two alleged militants from Bangladesh.
Addressing the rally that saw a crowd of two lakh people, Shah had attacked Banerjee over the Saradha case, terrorist activities as well as lack of development in the state.
The TMC on Sunday had refused to attach much importance to Shah's rally and described it as a 'grand flop show'.
The city police, West Bengal fire department and the Kolkata Municipal Corporation had denied permission for the event at the Victoria House, where the ruling Trinamool usually organises its annual martyrs' day rally.
An intervention by the Calcutta high court saw the BJP getting the nod only at the eleventh hour.

As some big-ticket deals await its clearance, Competition Commission of India (CCI) Chairman Ashok Chawla on Monday said that M&A reviews are not a work of crystal gazing, else astrologers could do that job.
The CCI chairman's comments come at a time when some of the major Mergers & Acquisitions (M&As), including the $4 billion Sun Pharma-Ranbaxy transaction, have been subject to strict scrutiny as part of assessing their overall impact on fair competition.
Chawla on Monday said that reviewing a complex M&A transaction or one that could reduce the number of players in the concerned market is not an easy task.
The Commission needs to look into the future structure of the market and this cannot be based simply on crystal gazing, if it were so then we could as well leave this job to astrologers of which we have no dearth at least in India, he said.
He was speaking at the International Competition Network (ICN) workshop in New Delhi, organised by the CCI.
The CCI has the mandate to keep a tab on unfair trade practices at the market place across sectors.
In recent times, the watchdog has put two mega deals under public scrutiny after prima-facie forming an opinion that these transactions could hurt competition.
Last month, Holcim-Lafarge deal became the second one after the $4 billion Sun Pharma-Ranbaxy transaction where the Commission sought comments from the public to assess fair competition concerns before taking the final call.

Congress red flags Govts plan for cut in social sector expenditure  raises issue in LokSabhaBy: Press Trust of India | New Delhi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 3:28 pm | Updated: December 1, 2014 3:31 pm
Centre’s reported move to cut “drastically” expenditure in social sector ministries was raised in Lok Sabha on Monday.
Raising the matter during Zero Hour, senior Congress member  said “reduction in social sector spending will lead to social unrest” and asked Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to reconsider the decision.
“The issue is to be addressed in a serious manner and I request the Finance Minister to reconsider the decision
without any delay,” he said.
Ramachandran said it has been widely reported that the government has decided to cut expenditure in social sector drastically in the coming financial year.
According to him, government is proposing to cut expenditure on education by Rs 11,000 crore, and the budget for the Department of Panchayat Raj, Rural Development and sanitation by about 25 per cent.
“Leading economists, social activists and people at large are deeply agitated over such a decision, as it will hamper our overall development and growth.
“Healthcare sector also will be adversely affected by this decision,” Ramachandran said.

Trinamool hits backs at Amit Shah  says his name is mentioned in red diary ofSaharaBy: Press Trust of India | New Delhi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 3:27 pm | Updated: December 1, 2014 7:43 pm
A day after BJP chief Amit Shah targeted Trinamool Congress in Kolkata, Mamata Banerjee’s party on Monday hit back alleging that his name was mentioned in a ‘red diary’ purportedly seized by CBI from Sahara’s office but the government dismissed the charge as speculation.
In Rajya Sabha on Monday, Trinamool MP Derek O’Brien tried to raise the issue of the alleged ‘red diary’ of Sahara and party members staged a walkout when they were not allowed to speak out of turn. Outside Parliament, Trinamool MPs staged a protest waving red placards with Sahara written on them and demanded a clarification from Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issue.
TMC leader Sudeep Bandhopadhyay told reporters that the BJP chief’s name was mentioned in a ‘red diary’ allegedly recovered by the Central Bureau of Investigation during searches at Sahara’s office in November. “We want to know why they are being secretive about the names…. Why is CBI not revealing the names? We will not let it go. We want a discussion on the issue,” he said.
“On 22nd November 2014, in a raid at CBI office, a red diary was recovered. In that red diary, I have information that national president of BJP Amit Shah’s name is present along with one Mr NM. Whose names are these? CBI is not revealing this… action has not been taken. I hope the government will clarify the issue,” he said.
Union Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju rejected the charges, saying these were false speculations and “political in nature”. “These all are false speculations,” the Minister said outside Parliament House. He said that political parties have the right to conduct rallies and meetings in any part of the country, a reference to attempts to stall Shah’s rally at Kolkata on Sunday.
“These are all political statements. A political party has the right to conduct rallies, meetings anywhere in the country. And if somebody is making a political issue out of it, it is political in nature,” he added.

Robert Downey Jrs charitysingingBy: Press Trust of India | London |
Posted: December 1, 2014 3:24 pm
‘Iron Man’ star Robert Downey Jr has revealed that he used to sing in shopping centres to raise money for music education. The 49-year-old actor decided to help raise money for music education by producing a series of impromptu concerts, Playing It Forward, which is a collaboration between his company Team Downey and online entertainment distributor Crackle, because he believes joining an a cappella group as a teenager helped him to develop the confidence to carve out a career in Hollywood, reported Contactmusic.
“When I was growing up, it was a given that if you wanted to have that initial exploration into music, it was readily available to you – regardless of what was going on with the economy or state budget. Clearly there has been a shift in that,” Downey said.
“We are hoping to make you want to stop on the street and listen to the message. As a kid, I played the drums and piano, and late, when I went to Santa Monica High School, I joined an a cappella group and sang at malls during the holidays. That’s what ultimately gave me confidence as a performer. All kids should have the opportunity to be exposed to music,” he added.
Playing it Forward – which launched in November 2013 – features surprise street performances across the USA from some of the biggest names in music, including John Legend and Imagine Dragons, all benefiting music education and charities of the artists’ choice.

CCI suggests changes to Sun-Ranbaxy dealCompetition Commission suggests changes to Sun-Ranbaxy deal
PTI Dec 1, 2014, 03.43PM IST
(CCI has suggested Sun Pharma…)
NEW DELHI: After a detailed scrutiny, fair trade watchdog CCI has suggested Sun Pharma and Ranbaxy to make certain changes in their proposed $4 billion merger deal, including possible divestment of some brands, to address anti-competitive concerns.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has finalised its view on the mega deal, also the first transaction that was subject to public scrutiny, and the same has been conveyed to the concerned parties.
The deal, which CCI has prima-facie found to be in violation of competition norms, was inked in April this year and has been awaiting clearance from the competition watchdog since then.
Sources said the regulator is now awaiting response from the parties on the suggested changes.
Among others, CCI is believed to have suggested divestment of some brands in order to comply with competition norms, they added.
Sun Pharma-Ranbaxy transaction, which would create the country's largest pharmaceutical company, had come under close scrutiny of CCI after it was found prima-facie that the "combination is likely to have an appreciable adverse effect on competition".
The combined entity would have operations in 65 countries, 47 manufacturing facilities across 5 continents, and a significant platform of speciality and generic products marketed globally. The deal is also the first one where the commission sought public comments.
Major issues examined by CCI on the deal are with respect to the molecules market.
The public scrutiny of the deal, which would create the fifth largest speciality generics company in the world, ended on September 24.
This big ticket deal in the pharma space is also the first M&A transaction to have gone through public scrutiny.

The US rating agency said the outlook was stable.

Top 5 stocks that could be multibaggers; they have returned up to 593% in a yearAhluwalia Contracts (India) Ltd.
(Even though most of the stocks…)
NEW DEHI: It has been a dream run for the Indian markets with the S&P BSE Sensex recording a return of over 35 per cent so far in the year 2014. The euphoria in the markets has also led to a strong rally in various small and midcap stocks which have more than doubled in the same period.
Even though most of the stocks have already rallied a lot, analysts still see further upside in names like Aries Agro, Century Plyboards, Lumax Auto, and Ahluwalia Contracts, which have already more than doubled so far in the year 2014 and will continue to remain multibagger in the near future, say analysts.
Considering the overall situation of falling crude prices and control over domestic inflation, analysts predict a strong growth in the earnings in the coming quarters, which will give a further boost to the markets. So the rally is here to stay!
Global investment bank Citigroup in its latest report has raised the December-2015 Sensex target to 33000, from 31,000 earlier, translating into an upside of 15 per cent from Friday's closing level of 28,693.99.
We have collated a list of five less-known names from different brokerage firms, which belong to either the mid or small cap sector. These stocks have the potential to remain multibagger stocks in the near future:
Aries Agro Ltd: HDFC Securities recommends 'buy' and add on declines
Aries Agro Ltd (AAL) is a leader in nutritional products for plants, and manufactures a wide range of products under 65 brands of plant nutrients crop protection chemicals. Its diversified product portfolio and wide distribution network enables it to have an upper edge over its peers. Its product mix with multiple products targeting various strata of farmer is a huge entry barrier.
The company currently stands in a very strong position to grab the opportunities in the micronutrients segment in the agriculture industry. Going ahead we feel that the company could enhance its topline and bottomline substantially because of expected growth in the demand for its products.
The experienced management, higher capacity utilization, widespread network, further scope for spreading across the nation and higher utility of its products could act as a trigger for AAL to grow in the coming years.
Century Plyboards India Ltd: Sharekhan maintains 'buy'
Century Plyboards (Century) is a leading player in the fast growing plywood and laminate segment, with an overall share of 25 per cent of the organised plywood market, which is estimated at Rs4,500-4,800 crore.
The organised plywood and laminate segment is growing at healthy double digits due to an improving demand environment and a shift towards branded products. The brokerage firm believes that it can grow ahead of the industry, at 22% CAGR, over the next three to five years.
 
Century is a high-quality consumer play with a dominant market share in a fast growing niche segment. Consequently, Sharekhan expects the stock to command a premium valuation and outperform the broader market over the long term. We initiate coverage on the stock with a Buy rating.
Lumax Auto Technologies Ltd: IndiaNivesh Securities maintains 'buy'
Lumax Auto Technologies (LATL) is a supplier of key components to the two-wheeler and the passenger car industries. Its key customers include Bajaj Auto, Piaggio, Honda Motorcycles and Scooters, Maruti Suzuki, Toyota and Tata Motors. Strong tie-ups with these OEMs will entail large business opportunities in the next few years.
In spite of weak environment for auto OEMs, LATL's revenues stayed flattish in the past couple of years. However, EBIT margin weakened due to impact of higher depreciation and interest costs related to new plants .
From here on, the research firm expects strong volume growth coupled with margin expansion in the next couple of years. With comfortable D/E of 0.2x and robust ROCE of over 17%, they find current valuations attractive.
Visaka Industries Ltd: Angel Broking maintains 'buy'
Visaka Industries (VIL) is engaged in two businesses - building products (cement asbestos products and fibre cement flat products like V-boards and V-panels) and synthetic yarn.
It has an installed capacity of 7,52,000 MT of cement asbestos products with a strong network of 6000 plus stockists / dealers across India. With consumer and business confidence improving in building products segment and sustainable performance of its synthetic yarn segment, the brokerage firm expects the company to post a strong performance going ahead.
Angel Broking expects the net profit to grow at a CAGR of 81 per cent over FY2014-16E to Rs 39 cr. At the current price, the stock is trading at a valuation of 5x FY2016E EPS, which we believe is attractive. They initiate coverage on VIL with a Buy rating.
Ahluwalia Contracts India Ltd: AnandRathi initiating with a Buy

Oil Falls More Than $2 a Barrel to Five-Year LowOil Slumps Near $59 for First Time Since 2009 on Oversupply
Singapore: Oil fell more than $2 a barrel to a five-year low in Asian trade on Monday, extending a steep sell-off after OPEC decided not to cut production last week, keeping markets well supplied.
Both US crude and Brent have fallen for five straight months, oil's longest losing streak since the 2008 financial crisis.
"Just when the market was thinking that a 4-year low for crude oil was bad enough, we have hit a 5-year low after the OPEC meeting," Phillip Futures analysts said in a note.
US crude tumbled to near $64, dragging Brent down below $70, after Saudi Arabia's oil minister told fellow OPEC members last week that they must combat the US shale oil boom.
"They (OPEC) can get by at $60 a barrel, but that price would knock out a fair whack of the competition - much US shale oil for example - as well as put investment in future capacity growth firmly on the back-burner," ANZ analysts said in a note.
"They're playing the long game, banking that others can't."
Brent hit a low of $67.82 a barrel, the lowest since October 2009, and was down $1.71 at $68.44 a barrel by 0733 GMT. US crude fell $1.49 to $64.66 a barrel, after earlier slipping to an intraday low of $64.10, the lowest since July 2009.
Oil-producing countries from Iraq to Nigeria are revising their 2015 budgets to reflect lower prices.
Iran refrained from protesting against OPEC's decision to retain its production ceiling to maintain group solidarity, even though the move will not benefit all members, Iranian oil minister said in local media reports.
Slower than expected growth in China's manufacturing sector may add further downward pressure on oil. China's official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) slipped to 50.3 in November, a government study showed on Monday, lower than analysts' forecasts of 50.6.
"It's not too bad a miss, but probably won't help (oil) too much," Ric Spooner, chief analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney said.
"It's best not to try to pick bottoms at this stage."
Spooner said the next support levels for Brent are at $68 and $64 a barrel. If West Texas Intermediate crude futures fall below $63.90 a barrel, the next support level would be at $50, he said.

01:30 pm
In an interview to CNBC-TV18, Deepak Jain, Managing Director of Lumax Industries  spoke about the financial performance of the company in the quarter gone by and shared outlook on the way ahead hereon.
Currently, the company’s order book stands at Rs 6000 crore for projects in the next 3-5 years.
Going ahead, Jain plans to invest Rs 3000 crore in various Greenfield and Brownfield sites as well as technology, which will help the company double its revenues in 5 years.
Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview:
Q: Take us through your capex plans first. I believe that you have Rs 300 crore outlay for the next few years and that is going to lead to your turnover doubling. Take us through those details?
A: On November 28, we completed 25 years of listing on the Bombay Stock Exchange. In addition, 2014 year marked 30 years completion of our relationship with Stanley Electric Company of Japan. That is obviously the past but going forward we are in a very good positions where the order books are almost close to about Rs 600 crore for the next three to five years. We have plan to invest in Greenfield and Brownfield sites as well as technology for about an outlay of about Rs 300 crore which would helps us to double our revenues in next five years.
Q: Maruti  is your biggest client as of now. How much of your total revenues do you get from Maruti at this point in time and what sort of outlook can you give us with regards to your relationship with the company? It comes at a time when Maruti reported very good sales for November as well.
A: Maruti continues to remain our number one client. As of now the revenue baskets about 38 percent of Lumax Industries revenue come from Maruti Suzuki. We also are at a largest lighting player for Maruti Suzuki. A market penetration within Maruti itself is about 70 percent for lighting. Fundamentally, we had invested for Maruti proactively over last three years in our newest facility which is at Bawal and that is under commissioned.
We are 100 percent on the Swift, Alto and Ritz and other platforms as well. Obviously, Maruti has remained consistent with its volumes for the last two to three years. However with this upturned coming in and the new model lineup that Maruti has we are expecting a good boost with Maruti’s growth coming in and we also have plans to support its Gujarat facility.
Q: What about your exports? How much does it contribute to your total sales at present?
A: As of now, it is about 4 percent. However, Lumax continues to focus on the domestic market. We have a market penetration on over all India an about 55 percent. The competition in this segment is intense and hence the company focuses on this domestic market more. You also have to understand that lighting itself is a very fragile part it is not very logistic friendly so we continue to export orders on customers like Volkswagen, specifically Audi, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) even truck lights which is supporting Case New Holland and John Deere. So these are exporting into western in terms of Europe as well as US.
Q: What is your total order book stand at this point in time?
A: As of now for the next three years the current order books is about Rs 600 crore.
Q: In first half of the year, we have seen that your sales have grown roughly around by 6 percent but you have given a guidance that this year you are going to see 10 percent jump so second half of the year going to be much better?
A: That is right; we are expecting sudden growth not just by volumes but also new platforms. We have to understand that lighting is also a product which also goes through continuous refreshing so we expecting both volumes growth as well as new platform growth.

The infrastructure and banking industry suffers losses worth around Rs 400 crore per day due to delayed decision-making at various levels, Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari said here today.
The minister said when he took charge in May, he was given the uphill task of untangling investments worth Rs 1,80,000 crore in the sector due to lag in land acquisition, forest and environmental clearances.
"The (previous) government was mainly responsible for about Rs 1,80,000 crore worth of projects stuck. It was 90 percent government's responsibility and 10 percent fault of contractors and bankers," Gadkari said at an Assocham event.
"Delay in taking decisions costs about Rs 400 crore per day to developers and bankers," he added.
As many as 189 projects worth Rs 1,80,000 crore were stuck due to problems in land acquisition, delays in forest and environmental clearances, non-transfer of defence land and hurdles in rail over-bridges.
Problems in most of the projects have been cleared and rest of the work is in progress, said Gadkari, adding that after clearing the backlog, Road Ministry aspires to build 30 kms of roads per day.
The government is currently working on projects worth Rs 21,000 crore in Jammu & Kashmir and Rs 15,000 crore in the North-Eastern region.
The minister further said that National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is working on improving the main accidental spots at various highways in the country.

Buy Tata Motors (DVR)  DLF: Manas Jaiswal02:30 pm
Manas Jaiswal of manasjaiswal.com told CNBC-TV18, "Most of the auto stocks are looking strong and I have picked Tata Motors (DVR)  because the stock was facing lot of resistance near to Rs 340-338 for last one month but today it has broken that range with higher volumes. So, the stock can test Rs 365. That is our target and stoploss should be Rs 342."
"The reality stocks are facing selling pressure but DLF  is still strong. It is sustaining above 50-day moving average. It has some resistance near to Rs 155. However looking at the pattern it can break that resistance and it can test Rs 165 which is its 200-day moving average. So, one can go long with a stoploss of Rs 149," he said.

A young Kulgam voter travels from Delhi to take part in Jammu and Kashmir electionsPriyarag Verma , IBNLive.com | Dec 01, 2014 at 02:16pm IST
The desire to bring a change in the state has brought a young voter working in Delhi to the Kashmir Valley. Even though 26-year-old Adil admitted that he had no desire to come back to Jammu and Kashmir permanently, he wanted to ensure that clean and good candidates enter the state Assembly.
Adil works with the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research in Delhi but is a voter in Kulgam constituency where the electorate is extremely excited at the huge turnout in the first phase of polling on November 25. He and his friends said that Kulgam had undergone a massive change in the last decade and transformed into a town from a small village.
They added that Kulgam voters, too, would come out in large numbers to exercise their franchise on December 2 in the second phase of elections.
Communist Party of India-Marxist Jammu and Kashmir Secretary Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami has been representing Kulgam since 1996 and is seeking a fourth consecutive term.
While many youngsters that IBNLive spoke to in different constituencies were not keen on voting, Adil said that if the younger generation does not come forward then the state can never develop. Admitting that unemployment and corruption were the two biggest issues plaguing the state, he said that the first problem can be addressed only if big private industries are set up in Jammu and Kashmir.
"There is no job for youngsters. This is why I moved to Delhi. At other places there are many private companies and lot of jobs but there is nothing here. After completing their education, young boys and girls have no option here. There are only government jobs here and for that one must have a very good source or pay bribe," said Adil.
"Corruption is endemic here. After a leader is elected, his or her main motive is to make money. But our MLA (Mohammad Yousuf) Tarigami has done good work unlike many others. The roads are good, there is a district hospital and even the security situation is much better in Kulgam," he said.
In fact the roads and the district hospital seemed to be in a much better shape in Kulgam than many other neighbouring constituencies where enthusiasm about elections was missing.
He said that just like other parts of India, the development of Kashmir is dependent on peace in the Valley. Calling on all the stakeholders - India, Pakistan and Kashmiris - to find a solution soon, he said that unless peace is restored completely, the region will never be able to fulfil its potential. "India is developing so fast. It is several years ahead of Kashmir. We need to have peace here and only after that development will be possible," he added.
Communist Party of India-Marxist Jammu and Kashmir Secretary Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami has been representing Kulgam since 1996 and is seeking a fourth consecutive term.
Tarigami has formed a front called the Awami Muttahida Mahaz (AMM) with Tangmarg MLA Ghulam Hassan Mir of the Democratic Party Nationalist (DPN) and Khansahib MLA Hakeem Mohammad Yaseen of the People's Democratic Front (PDF). Both Ghulam Hassan Mir and Hakeem Mohammad Yaseen had won as independents in the 2008 Assembly elections.

Phani Sekhar, Fund Manager-PMS at Angel Broking told CNBC-TV18, "The long-term horizon for aviation or for that matter  SpiceJet doesn’t look interesting. Despite if you look at the second quarter results, despite 82 percent load factor, they have reported 9 percent decline in revenue per passenger that is due to promotional air fares, competition and due to entry of new carriers. Now, you combine this with the kind of negative networth of Rs 1,000 crore that they are having and debt, it doesn’t paint a very good picture."
"Load factors over the longer-term in an expanding market like India cannot be expected to go above 85 percent because all the time you would like to preserve your market share by growing new capacity. So I think on the balance it will be a good idea for the investor to get out of this share taking advantage of today’s rally, long-term I am not very bullish on this," he said.

Sugar mills to restart operations          Date  01-Dec-2014        Source  Business Line        Reporter  Our Bureau        News Id 1629 Bengaluru, November 30: Private sugar factories in Karnataka have decided to resume cane crushing for the 2014-15 sugar season from Sunday following assurances from the State government that their demands will be looked into. The mills are demanding that the government extend more fiscal support to them as a declining trend in sugar prices is making their operations unviable. Pavan Kumar, President of the Karnataka chapter of the South India Sugar Mills Association, said the decision to restart operations was taken after assurances from the Chief Minister Siddaramiah. Some mills, especially in north Karnataka, had closed operations, while others were yet to start crushing, citing their inability to pay farmers as a downward trend in prices had hurt their viability. Of the 63 mills, about 40 are privately owned and the total cane arrears in the State stands at around ?1,800 crore.

Fadnavis issues gag order to BJP leaders over ongoing talks with Shiv SenaSaudi cleric's wife shows face on TV, sparking uproar
In a veiled attack on senior Shiv Sena leader Ramdas Kadam, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said “only the official interlocutors in the BJP-Sena talks should comment on the parleys.”
“My request is that if only those who are official interlocutors talk (to media), then the process will move ahead,” Fadnavis told reporters.
“See, it is like this. If you ask those who come to talk with us, you will know if there is a proposal or not,” the Chief Minister said, referring to claims by some in Sena that there was no “concrete proposal” from BJP on Sena’s participation in the state government.
Fadnavis, who held meeting with Sena leaders expressed confidence that a positive outcome would emerge out of the talks.
Two days after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) formally resumed talks with Sena on the issue of joining the government, Sena leader Ramdas Kadam yesterday accused the estranged ally of “fooling” his party by purposefully dragging on power-sharing deliberations.
Kadam also alleged that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Eknath Khadse, who is the Revenue Minister, was trying hard to “topple” the Fadnavis government as he was not made the Chief Minister of the state.
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had on Friday said it would talk to Shiv Sena with an “open mind” on the issue of the latter’s participation in the Devendra Fadnavis-led government in Maharashtra.
“We are going to meet Shiv Sena leaders with an open mind. We have been allies in the past and the Sena is also part of BJP-led government at the Centre,” Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had told reporters before leaving for ‘Matoshree’, the residence of Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray, where he held talks with Sena leaders for one and a half hour.
“Shiv Sena has been our natural ally. We will hold talks with an open mind,” Pradhan had said.
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has 121 MLAs in the 288-member House. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), which has 41 MLAs, announced outside support to the state government, but some in BJP are wary of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar and are making attempts to rope in Sena, which has 63 MLAs.

BJP fooling Sena by dragging on power sharingSaudi cleric's wife shows face on TV, sparking uproar
Even as ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Maharashtra has formally resumed talks with Shiv Sena on issue of joining the government, Sena leader Ramdas Kadam accused the estranged ally of “fooling” his party by purposefully dragging on power sharing deliberations.
He also alleged that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Eknath Khadse, who is the Revenue Minister, was trying hard to “topple” the Fadnavis government as he was not made the chief minister of the state.
“Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is only fooling us by constantly saying they want us (Shiv Sena) to be included in the state government. If that was the case, why did they keep doing inconclusive talks for one whole month?” Kadam said here.
Observing that Sena has made up its mind to sit in opposition, he said Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is playing the tactics in a bid to shield itself from Sena’s wrath in the upcoming Winter Session of the state Legislature.
“Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is playing the talks game so that they can protect themselves against us when we rake up issues concerning Maharashtra. They (BJP) are only cheating us by talking about an alliance with us. Nobody trusts BJP now,” he said.
Accusing BJP of lacking will power to join hands with Sena again, Kadam said, “Only they (BJP) can say what talks are they exactly conducting at ‘Matoshree’ (the residence of Thackeray family in suburban Bandra).”
Training his guns on Khadse, whom Sena holds responsible for breaking up of the 25-year-old alliance ahead of the October Assembly elections, Kadam said, “Eknath Khadse has lost sense of what is right and what’s wrong.
“He is now trying all possible means to topple the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government because he was not made the CM of Maharashtra,” he said.
The talks between Sena and BJP are dragging on, apparently over Sena’s demand for the post of Deputy CM in Fadnavis-led dispensation and for key portfolios, including Home, whereas BJP is firm on not having a Deputy CM.
However, Sena’s support of 63 MLAs is also crucial for Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which has 121 MLA’s in 288-member House to cobble up the magic figure of 145 to have a simple majority.

Waiting For Comcast Cable Guy Could Be Less Hellish With New App Featurereddit
Can an app help reboot Comcast's image?
Between surveys showing many dissatisfied customers and the " Customer Service Call From Hell " heard 'round the world, the Comcast brand has taken a beating in recent months.
But the country's largest cable operator says it's making changes and investing billions of dollars to improve the customer experience. One of the latest efforts aims to help you spend less time waiting for the technician to fix your Internet or TV service.
Comcast is testing a new service in its MyAccount app that allows customers to track the arriving technician in real time on their mobile devices. The app will tell you when the technician is 30 minutes away -- so in theory you could come home from work to meet the rep. The app will also tell you if the tech has been held up and will be late.
Of course, many people have commutes longer than 30 minutes, but it's certainly a step in the right direction.
"You have things to do," Charlie Herrin, senior vice president of customer experience at Comcast, wrote in a blog post announcing the new feature. "Waiting for us to show up shouldn’t be one of them."
Comcast is certainly not winning any popularity contests these days. In May, the American Consumer Satisfaction Index ranked the company second to last in its yearly ranking of consumer satisfaction.
In July, a recording of a customer service call went viral . During the call, a Comcast rep simply wouldn't let Ryan Block, a product manager at AOL (parent company of The Huffington Post), disconnect from Comcast. The recording did prompt Comcast to publicly apologize to Block .
The new tool, which seems similar to the car-tracking feature in popular ride-summoning apps like Uber and Lyft, is only being tested in Boston. But if the tests go well, the company wants to roll it out to more customers next year, Herrin wrote in the blog post.
A Comcast spokesperson said it was too early to identify the specific markets that would see the new feature early next year.
The tool borrows another element from the on-demand car service apps: You'll be able to rate your service experience.
Unlike the transportation market -- in many cities you can choose among taxis, car services and ride-summoning apps -- many people don't have much of an alternative if they have a bad experience with a Comcast tech. As Tom Wheeler, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, recently pointed out, most people have no real choice when it comes to truly high-speed Internet.
This new feature in Comcast's app comes as the company tries to complete a $45 billion purchase of Time Warner Cable, the second largest cable operator in the country. (Time Warner Cable held last place in that American Consumer Satisfaction Index.) The deal, which has opposition from consumer advocacy groups, still needs to be approved by federal regulators.

Icelandic hacker says guilty of stealing money from WikileaksIcelandic hacker says guilty of stealing money from Wikileaks

Trials and Arbitration
An Icelandic computer hacker and former associate of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange unexpectedly pleaded guilty on Wednesday to embezzling 30 million Icelandic crowns ($240,000) from the organization.
Sigurdur Thordar­s­son's courtroom plea is the latest twist in the saga of Wikileaks, which released thousands of secret U.S. embassy cables in 2010 and 2011, deeply embarrassing Washington.
0
Known as 'Siggi the Hacker', Thordar­s­son has previously said that he turned an informant for the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in 2011, a year before Assange fled to the Ecuadorian embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden over sexual assault accusations that he has denied.
In the run up to his Iceland trial, Thordar­s­son rejected charges that he stole the proceeds of the sales of Wikileaks-branded items, and his U-turn on Wednesday was a surprise.
"After going over the charges thor­oughly and speak­ing with my client, he has de­cided to plead guilty to all charges," Thordar­s­son's lawyer, Vil­hjal­mur Vil­hjalms­son, told the court.
The lawyer would not make any comment after the court session, including why Thordar­s­son had changed his mind.
No date was set for sentencing in the case.
Thordar­s­son posted a long description of his ties to Wikileaks including photos of him with Assange, his dialogue with the FBI and his defense against the fraud charges, on an Icelandic news website in June 2013.
He originally said his own bank account had to be used to take in money for Wikileaks merchandise because a block had been imposed on company credit cards after the release of the cables.
Wikileaks said it believed Thordar­s­son had talked to the FBI in Denmark.
"He was a volunteer who abused his position through fraud to obtain money from T-shirts and coffee mugs just after we were imposed with the banking blockade," Wikileaks representative Kristinn Hrafnsson, himself Icelandic, said by telephone.
"We lodged a complaint in Denmark pertaining to a meeting that took place between him and FBI agents in 2011. We want that to be probed on the basis that it was an illegal operation according to Danish law," he said.
There has been no immediate word from the Danish authorities about the complaint.

Obamacare Sign-Ups Near 500 000 After First WeekObamacare Sign-Ups Near 500,000 After First Week

reddit
More than 460,000 people enrolled in a private health insurance plan on the federally run Obamacare exchanges in 37 states during the first week of the sign-up period for 2015 coverage, the Department of Health and Human Services announced Wednesday .
These enrollments are almost evenly split between renewals of existing customers and new sign-ups, according to a report issued by the department. More than 1 million people have submitted applications for financial assistance and coverage and almost 1.6 million have reviewed prices for insurance using HealthCare.gov 's window-shopping feature between Nov. 15, the opening day of the three-month health insurance exchange enrollment period , and Nov. 21, the department disclosed.
President Barack Obama's administration aims to sign up more than 9 million people for private health insurance via these exchange marketplaces by the close of the enrollment period on Feb. 15, including renewing most of the approximately 7 million people who already have insurance policies obtained through the federally operated exchanges and those run by 13 states and the District of Columbia .
"We had a solid start, but we have a lot of work to do every day between now and February 15," Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Matthews Burwell said in a press release.
Last week, the Department of Health and Human Services was forced to acknowledge it overcounted Obamacare health insurance enrollments for this year by hundreds of thousands by including people who purchased dental plans, after a report by Bloomberg News revealed the error, which was uncovered by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.
During a conference call Wednesday with reporters, Burwell pledged greater transparency about the Obamacare exchanges. The Department of Health and Human Services will issue weekly and monthly reports on health insurance exchange enrollment, Burwell said.
The number of enrollees during the first week of the current sign-up push is more than four times the number who selected health insurance plans during all of October 2013, when the exchanges launched amid crippling technical problems.
States including Kentucky , Maryland and California that have their own exchanges also have reported strong enrollments so far.
Half a million enrollees in a week puts federal Obamacare officials on pace to sign up close to 1.8 million people during the first month, but the system remains far from the 9.1 million target for 2015 enrollees, which Burwell established earlier this month. The administration is standing by that aspiration, however, she said.
"We are staying with that number," Burwell said. "We have a lot of work before us, and we're going to continue focusing on that."
As of last month, nearly 7 million people had health insurance policies purchased through an exchange. The federal marketplaces and most state-run exchanges will automatically renew customers into their same plans for next year if they don't choose a different one. But with health insurance premium increases and decreases varying widely across the nation -- especially for the least costly and most popular policies on the market in 2014 -- consumers who fail to shop around could wind up paying much more by standing pat instead of seeking more affordable plans for next year.
"We are strongly urging and encouraging everyone to come back, make sure your information is the most up-to-date," Burwell said. "For many, many people it is very important to come back and shop."
The deadline to choose a health insurance plan that will be in place on Jan. 1 is Dec. 15. Current enrollees who automatically are renewed into their policies can still switch to a new one for the rest of next year after that date, up to the final deadline for 2015 coverage on Feb. 15 .
This post has been updated with details from a conference call Burwell had with reporters.

5 ways you can fatten your wallet over Thanksgiving weekendBy Jonnelle Marte November 27 Follow @jonnelle
The turkey will fill your belly, but you can use the long weekend to pad your wallet, too. (AP Photo/Matthew Mead)
It’s Thanksgiving and soon your belly will be full. Wouldn’t you like to do a few things to fill your wallet, too?
You might as well use some of your holiday weekend time to cross off items on your financial to-do list. If you don’t have one, here are some things you should think about tackling in between football, food and shopping.
1. Make sure you’re really getting a good deal. If you are going to brave the stores Thanksgiving night or on Black Friday, make sure the deal you’re being offered is worth it. Know what time the sales start . And keep in mind that the average discount offered on Black Friday is 39 percent, according to WalletHub , so anything less than that might not be worth the hassle. My colleague Hayley Tsukayama also compiled a list of five shopping apps  that can help you track and compare deals.
2. Choose a health plan. About a  half-million people chose plans through HealthCare.gov during the first week of open enrollment. The period ends Feb. 15, but plans need to be chosen by Dec. 15 for coverage to kick in Jan. 1. That makes this weekend a good time to sign up or to shop around and compare plans if you’re not quite ready. Here is a guide to help you sort through your options and make sure you don’t get stuck in the wrong plan  or spend more than you need to.
3. Estimate your tax bill. I know you don’t like to think about April in November, but getting a handle on what you might owe on your tax bill can give you more time to prepare for it. It also gives you time to think about what changes you can make now to lower that tax bill before it’s too late. (Many of those changes would need to be made before New Year’s Eve rolls around.)  Tax preparation companies like  TurboTax  and  H&R Block  offer online estimators.
4. Increase your 401(k) contribution. The end of the year is a good time to re-evaluate finances and set goals. Increasing the contribution rate for your retirement accounts now can lead to a big payoff over time. (Money that is invested has more potential to grow than money that is kept in cash or spent.) The move can also lower your taxable income and reduce how much you might owe in taxes next year.
5. Support a good cause. While you’re sitting around reflecting on what you’re grateful for, you may feel inspired to make a donation to a cause that’s important to you. (By the way, that contribution may also help you reduce your tax bill.) If you can’t give money, consider giving your time. Groups like VolunteerMatch will pair people with nonprofits looking for help.

Watch: What Chernobyl looks like now  from a droneBy Ishaan Tharoor November 28 Follow @ishaantharoor
The area around Ukraine's Chernobyl power plant, site of one of the world's most horrifying nuclear disasters, is the subject of endless fascination. Increasingly, adventurous tourists and scientists have come to the site, which was abandoned after a reactor in the Soviet facility exploded in 1986. Cloaked in both the trauma and the poison of the disaster, Chernobyl's surreal isolation has spurred the return of once imperiled species  and the imagination of filmmakers.
The 2012 horror flick "Chernobyl Diaries" sends a pack of overeager tourists to the ghost town of Pripyat, where 50,000 Chernobyl factory workers used to live. They don't realize that other fell things lurk amid the ruins and the rest is predictable (and forgettable) Hollywood schlock.
But Pripyat is worth seeing. On assignment in Chernobyl's environs, British videographer Danny Cooke used a drone to film the Soviet-era facades of Pripyat's residential complexes, the rusted ferris wheels and the layers of dust and decay that have built up amid the desolation of a whole town. It's a haunting sight, as Cooke explains himself :
During my stay, I met so many amazing people, one of whom was my guide Yevgen, also known as a 'Stalker'. We spent the week together exploring Chernobyl and the nearby abandoned city of Pripyat. There was something serene, yet highly disturbing about this place. Time has stood still and there are memories of past happenings floating around us.

Lightsaber critics say the one in the Star Wars teaser could never work. Theyre wrong.By Brian Fung November 28 Follow @b_fung

The new Star Wars trailer has only been out for a couple of hours, and while it's getting mostly positive feedback, there's one moment in particular that keeps attracting attention: The part where a Sith turns on a lightsaber, and then turns on two other lightsabers that act as a crossguard of some kind.
The crossguard idea purports to solve the problem of an opposing lightsaber sliding down and hitting the defender's hand. Some, like The Verge's T.C. Sottek, argue that even if this is a concern, the way it's been implemented here doesn't actually protect the hand.
— tc (@chillmage) November 28, 2014
As anyone who's watched the Star Wars movies knows, lightsabers can cut through pretty much anything — including other lightsabers, as when Obi-Wan Kenobi sliced Darth Maul's double lightsaber in half . So the fact that the crossguard saber leaves a bit of room for an enemy lightsaber to come slicing through the emitter seems to defeat the whole point of the crossguard. And that's silly.
But hang on. There just may be an explanation for this that makes the crossguard a little less implausible than it might seem.
In the Star Wars universe, there are certain rare materials that are thought to be lightsaber-resistant. Among these are substances like phrik , cortosis  and Mandalorian iron , which have been used to create weapons and armor that can deflect or short-circuit lightsaber beams. There's a precedent for lightsabers made of phrik: Emperor Palpatine's lightsaber was, according to  Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith: The Visual Dictionary . In Star Wars video games, cortosis has been shown to block lightsabers, and sometimes shut them down.
Maybe J.J. Abrams has really done his homework on Star Wars technology. Maybe what he's telling us is that this Sith saber is made of one of these resistant materials.
Okay, probably not. It's more likely the producers just made a silly design choice. And of course, even if the crossguard emitters were made of cortosis, why not just make the whole crossguard out of it, too? Seems like that would be easier.
But until I'm proven otherwise, I'm going to assume the Sith have figured out how to manufacture lightsabers with superpowers.

Nerds around the world felt a great disturbance in the force, as if millions of Internet users suddenly scrambled to watch their first glimpse of the new Star Wars film. The first teaser trailer of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, the Disney-backed feature directed by J.J. Abrams and set after the original film trilogy, premiered on iTunes this morning.

Previously, it was announced that the trailer would be premiering at a handful of select theaters across the country this weekend -- potentially setting up a similar situation to Episode I, when diehard fans bought tickets to unrelated films just to watch the new Star Wars trailer. Then earlier this week, it was revealed that the trailer would also be posted online Friday  -- but via Apple's iTunes Trailers service.
But fans with an aversion to Apple's Quicktime plugin, fear not. Within minutes of the video hitting the Web, copies started making their way onto other services -- including Youtube .

Can this caregiver retire at age 62(iStock)
Like many women her age, Grace Lim cares for an aging parent.
But Lim, 59, also has another relative under her watch — a sister who is near her age but can’t work because of a disability. The three live together, and Lim has done well as the sole breadwinner in the household for the past several years. Now that she is thinking about retirement, she wonders if the steps she has taken — paying off the mortgage, maxing out her retirement contributions, buying long-term care insurance — will be enough.
After all, she would like to stop working in the next couple of years while her mother and her sister are still in good health. That would free up more time for the three of them to spend together at home or tending their plot in a community garden. It would also make Lim available in case her mom and her sister need more care.
“I just want to be with family,” says Lim, who works at an information technology help desk in Fairfax County. “Plus I’m not a spring chicken.”
We shared details about Lim’s finances with two retirement experts who offered some insight about what she is doing well and offered suggestions for changes she can make to stretch her savings.
The big picture. 
Lim has lived with her sister, 58, and her mother, 82, for about 10 years now, and she expects they will live together in retirement, too. Between her income of about $50,000 and the Social Security benefits her mother is receiving, they can more than cover their roughly $2,200 in monthly expenses.
Despite taking a pay cut this year because of a job change, Lim says she is able to contribute the yearly maximum $17,500 into her 401(k), along with the catch-up contribution of $5,500 the IRS allows for those 50 and up. (Starting next year, those limits will increase to $18,000 and $6,000, respectively.) That puts her in a rare category: Only about 12 percent of plan participants maxed out retirement contributions in 2013, according to Vanguard . Aside from retirement savings, Lim also has a substantial emergency fund that would cover about two years’ worth of living expenses.
The family has little debt. The mortgage on their two-bedroom apartment is paid off — though they must pay $500 in monthly condo fees and about $380 a month in property taxes. They don’t have car loans or credit card bills. “Grace should be commended for her frugal living,” says Jean Setzfand, vice president of financial security at AARP.
The questions.
While Lim is a big saver, she is worried that she is being too conservative with those savings, making it harder for her money to see her through retirement. Optimizing those savings is important because Lim would prefer to retire soon, at 62, if she can, instead of waiting until she reaches full retirement age.
But if she goes that route, Lim will have to reassess her insurance coverage. She currently gets her insurance through work, with the exception of a long-term care policy she bought for herself. Leaving her job will require her to buy separate health insurance until she is old enough to qualify for Medicare. She would also have to decide if she should buy a new life insurance policy to cover her family, or if her savings will be enough to take care of them.
Also, Lim is concerned about whether she’ll be able to keep up with rising condominium fees on a fixed income. She figures it may be more cost effective for them to move into a retirement home together a few years down the line.
Changes to be made.
When it comes to her investments, Lim’s instincts may be correct, says Marty Reid, a certified financial planner in Lincolnton, N.C. Because her money is mostly in cash and short-term bonds, Lim’s savings are growing by less than 1 percent each year. But she has also piled up enough in savings that even a modest increase in the return would go a long way, Reid says.
Lim has about 12 percent of her portfolio in stocks and the rest is in bonds, short-term Treasury bills, cash and certificates of deposit. That mostly cash approach puts her at risk of losing money to inflation, Reid says. Taking a more diversified approach may help her generate income in retirement and draw out her savings, he says. “It would increase her potential for long-term growth,” he says.
Someone Lim’s age who isn’t planning to draw down on the savings for at least four years might consider a conservative portfolio that would still provide some income. For instance, she can invest about 30 percent of the portfolio in stocks, Reid says, with 20 percent of that going to large-cap growth and value stocks, 7 percent in international stocks and 2 percent in mid-cap stocks. The rest of the portfolio could look something like this: 35 percent in intermediate bonds, 18 percent in short-term bonds, 7 percent in high-yield bonds and 6 percent in global bonds. Three percent could be stashed in cash and 2 percent invested in commodities like oil, gold or silver. (This would be separate from her emergency fund.)
Staying covered.
Lim gets her health care and life insurance through her job, which means that when she stops working, the coverage would end, too, Reid points out. But she can avoid a lapse in coverage, even if she retires early, the experts say.
For instance, if Lim retires at 62, before she can qualify for Medicare, she would have the option of shopping for health insurance through the insurance exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act, Setzfand say. Lim could also compare plans with an insurance broker. Her mother would continue to be covered by Medicare. And Lim’s sister, who does not have health insurance, may qualify for additional public benefits after she turns 60, Setzfand says. On BenefitsCheckUp,  a Web site by the National Council on Aging, or at one of the council’s local offices, Lim may find programs to help pay for her sister’s food, medication or doctor’s visits – needs that are modest now but could grow over time.
As for life insurance, Lim would have to decide if she should buy another policy after leaving her job, Reid says. On the one hand, the policy might help Lim feel like her family will be okay financially if she dies before they do. But she might not need it, especially if she waits until she is at least 65 to stop working, he adds. Lim’s savings may be enough to support her family, he says, adding that she may want to talk with an estate planning attorney about the best way to leave those savings to her mother and sister. If she buys another insurance policy, a 10-year policy may be the most cost-effective, he says.
Making it last.
Lim should keep in mind that the $1,200 she expects to collect from Social Security if she retires at 62, combined with the $600 her mother is collecting now, would fall short of the $2,200 she needs to cover monthly expenses, Setzfand says. That means she would need to start drawing down her savings right away.
Pushing back her retirement by a few years would increase her income, lower her monthly expenses and allow her to save for a few more years, Setzfand and Reid point out. For instance, if she delayed collecting Social Security benefits until age 66, Lim’s monthly benefits could grow by about $400 or more, eventually allowing her to cover most of her expenses and to save for an additional four years, Setzfand says.
One option is for Lim to stop working at 62 as planned, but to put off collecting Social Security benefits, Reid says. While this would require Lim to spend more out of her savings during her first years in retirement, she would benefit from a larger Social Security benefit later on.
Retirees who start taking Social Security at 62 receive a benefit that is 25 percent smaller than it would be if they waited until full retirement age. Every year they work beyond that until age 70, their benefits grow by an additional 8 percent (or up to 32 percent more). But that decision will come down to how Lim feels about her health and what her expenses are when she is ready to stop working, Reid says.
Delaying retirement could also lower Lim’s health-care expenses, Reid says. He estimates Lim could spend about $700 a month on health insurance if she buys a plan through the exchanges until she reaches age 65 and can get on Medicare, but the final rate could be different based on her age, where she lives and what insurance companies are offering then. At 65, she could transition to Medicare, at which point she might spend an estimated $500 a month.
The bottom line.
In the end, Lim’s chances of running out of money will depend on how much she earns or loses on her investments and how much her expenses vary from year to year. That means that with a few changes and trade-offs, she may well be able to retire at 62, Reid says.
For instance, it would help if Lim sees an average annual return of about 4 percent on her savings, after making a few changes to her portfolio, Reid says. It would also help Lim if she can keep her living expenses in retirement to roughly $24,000 a year, slightly less than what she is paying now on property taxes, food, health care, condo fees and other living costs, Reid says. (Those costs would grow slightly with inflation, he says.)
That may very well be possible. Lim says she may sell her condominium in the next several years and move into senior housing with her mother and her sister if the monthly costs are lower than her current living expenses. The proceeds of the sale could then be used to pad her savings. And Lim is toying with the idea of earning some extra cash by taking on a part-time job in retirement, depending on how her mother and sister are doing.
The bottom line, Reid says: “She has sufficient assets to retire at 62, but waiting until age 65 might bolster her financial security.”

Asus to bring ZenWatch to India next yearEnforcement Directorate probing beneficiary of Rs 425 crore Indian Premier League facilitation fee
Eyeing the growing demand for wearable devices in the country, Taiwanese tech giant Asus will bring its ‘ZenWatch’ to India early next year, priced below Rs 20,000.
The ZenWatch, which is Asus’ first wearable device, sports a curved display and can be paired with smartphones running Android 4.3 or higher.
“We are still finalising the launch and pricing of ZenWatch. It will work with Android phones and we expect to bring it to India in the beginning of next year,” Asus South Asia Regional Head and Country Manager (System Business Group India) Peter Chang told PTI.
The ZenWatch will compete with the likes of Moto 360, LG G Watch and Samsung Gear Live in India.
Asked about the pricing, he said: “It will be priced under Rs 20,000, though we are trying to bring the price down further. It will be competitively priced.”
The smart wearables category is growing globally with the likes of Samsung, LG and Apple coming out with their smartwatches across various price points.
Apart from smartwatches, many firms like Sony, Adidas and Goqii have introduced smartbands dedicated to healthcare or athletics with support apps like pedometer and heart rate monitor to help monitor various bodily functions.
Samsung’s Gear Live is listed for about Rs 15,900, while LG’s G Watch is priced at Rs 14,999 on Google Play.
The ZenWatch has 512MB RAM, 4GB storage, 1.63-inch display and is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 1.2GHz processor. With a stitched-leather watchband, the smartwatch allows users to reject or mute a call.
It tracks and displays a variety of health-related stats, including steps taken, calories burned, heart rate, activity duration, and exercise intensity.
Users can also see their smartphone’s camera viewfinder remotely on ASUS ZenWatch.
This is useful for selfie and group photos, letting the photographer compose the photo, release the shutter, and check the final result while being included in the shot.
Besides, Asus today announced a special campaign for its Zenfone series of smartphones.
Under the ‘Live the Zen life with Rannvijay’ campaign, Asus will offer various challenges to actor and VJ Rannvijay to showcase features of the smartphones.

Narrative Science raises $10 million  shifts from automated news storiesNorthwestern University
Chicago-based Narrative Science announced Friday that it has raised $10 million and signaled a shift from its original focus on creating automated news stories.
Narrative Science launched in 2010 out of a research project at Northwestern University that turned data into recaps of baseball games. In its early days, the startup drew attention for what some saw as an attempt to replace journalists with artificial intelligence. The company’s Quill platform can analyze structured data and turn it into simple, natural language stories.

Design-company owner: Retailers  consumers judge a game by its coverMatt Nuccio, owner of Design Edge, a design and packaging company based in Bethpage, N.Y., discussed wrapping for success during the Chicago Toy & Game Group’s Toy & Game Innovation Conference last week.
The biggest mistake in product packaging is TMI — too much imagery, Nuccio told game and toy makers.
He also recommended hitting stores to see what’s on the shelves and using that as a guide to help your product stand out.
“Go to as many retailers as you can,” he said. “Go to Toys R Us. Go to every specialty shop around you. If everything there is blue, then why have a blue package? Do anything you can to stand out.”
He said other considerations include:
GAMES
Know the sizes
Standard game sizes based on the size of store shelves give retailers flexibility with new products.
“If your products are terrible, they want to be able to pull it off the shelves and replace it easily,” Nuccio said.

A champion of the  99 percent : tech entrepreneurs who keep their day jobs0
Q. What are the necessary first steps?
A. The advantage of bootstrapping using a paycheck is if you’re testing different ideas and an idea doesn’t work, it doesn’t validate, you didn’t quit your job … so you can move onto the next idea and try validating that. 
Until you actually validate an idea, you don’t need to quit your job, you don’t need to go all in. It offers lots of flexibility; it’s a risk-mitigation measure.
Q. Should bootstrapping employees tell their bosses about their side businesses?
A. A lot of people are actually disclosing, and the bosses are quite fine with it. In the tech industry, employers are encouraging employees to become more entrepreneurial. It’s considered a plus, not a minus.
We are working with a bunch of companies, for example Oracle, where they are running corporate incubation programs. They’re asking employees to become entrepreneurial and call it intrapraneurship. Corporations are willing to incubate these ideas, give resources and give money [in exchange for a piece of the company].
Q. How can you do this without angering your employer?
A. If you’re working for a tech company or a digital agency and building an e-commerce business on the side, if you tell your employer you’re doing that, the employer’s not going to care, as long as you don’t encroach upon your day job.
You cannot expect that you’re going to encroach on your day job, because then you’re not going to fulfill obligations of your employer. That is unethical.
Q. You say most entrepreneurs who take this approach lack experience. How can they mentally prepare for this type of undertaking?
A. They should start to follow the case studies. It’s not easy at all, but it’s not exactly rocket science either. Start to understand how other people have done it and learn from them. They have done it, which means it can be done.

Soar point: The Virgin WayEnforcement Directorate probing beneficiary of Rs 425 crore Indian Premier League facilitation fee
RICHARD BRANSON, founder of the Virgin group of companies, whose diverse enterprises include airlines, record labels, hotels and so on, says when he was preparing to write The Virgin Way, his new book on leadership, he searched the term ‘leadership’ on Amazon and got 93,467 hits. The knighted British entrepreneur admits to having read none of those books.
However, like Losing My Virginity, his book that has barely moved from the business bestseller’s list since 1998, The Virgin Way, underlined with humour-laced philosophy, is likely to fly off the shelves too.
To be a good leader, Branson emphasises on the need to be a good listener and to break down organisational hurdles. In his own words, a good leader “must have vision, creativity and, perhaps most importantly, the ability to influence others to follow and support them in the challenges of moving an organisation into uncharted and often highly risky territory”.
Branson’s narrative touches on some important topics. For example, there is a chapter on the importance of innovation and another one urges entrepreneurs to manufacture their own luck by working really hard and capitalising on serendipity.
Branson expresses scorn for corporate mission statements, calling them hollow and generic. On hiring, he says, one should consider finding someone from within the company to maintain continuity. Bring in an outsider if you want to shake things up, he says.
Branson’s run-in with the law is well-known and he recounts it here, almost with relish, using his own example to prove that offenders deserve a second chance.
Take risks, relish in being the underdog, find holes in the operations of the ‘big dogs’, exploit them, change the game and finally beat them—these are Branson’s rules. However, he is not infallible. In fact, he has experienced more business failures than successes and he is frank about some of his failures, such as Virgin Cola, which fizzled out in the battle for market share with Coke in the mid-1990s. He acknowledges in retrospect that he underestimated Coke’s “might, determination, distribution and sheer marketing clout”, adding that it is easier to win customers to an airline with “tangibly superior” customer service than to change their “preferences for a fizzy drink”.
All through the book, Branson emphasises on creating a fun working environment, as a way to maintain passion and build teamwork. He is especially keen on parties and charitable volunteer work to help employees get to know each other.
Branson does not have an office as such, for he prefers to visit his businesses to see people where they work rather than they coming to him. If a more formal one-to-one conversation is required, he likes it to be in the living room of his house, sitting cross-legged on the sofa, shoes off.
Beware, though, his casual manner belies a sharp brain. Senior representatives of some of the world’s biggest, toughest, most security-conscious corporations say what they have said to Branson has come back to haunt them in future litigations.
Currently, Branson lives on Necker, his Caribbean island. While he says he made the move because he craved the lifestyle, it also means that he gains considerable UK tax benefits as a non-resident. For years, long before he based himself in Necker, Virgin profits were routed through offshore trusts.
Overall, in his new book, Branson doesn’t offer leadership lessons—be a good listener, hire the right people, admit your failures, quickly move on and the likes—that haven’t already been covered. The book, in fact, is less about leadership lessons and more about Branson’s passion for entrepreneurship.

Mom: Missing Football Player Texted About ConcussionsMom: Missing Ohio Sate Football Player Texted About Concussions
 | By                                                                ANN SANNER

COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — A missing Ohio State University football player told his mother in a text message the day he disappeared that concussions had his head messed up, according to a report filed with police.
Kosta Karageorge, a 22-year-old senior defensive tackle from Columbus, was last seen at his apartment around 2 a.m. Wednesday. Team spokesman Jerry Emig confirmed that Karageorge missed practice Wednesday and Thursday, which his family says was uncharacteristic.
Karageorge's parents filed a missing-person report Wednesday evening, listing him as white, 6-foot-5, 285 pounds, bearded and bald.
His mother, Susan Karageorge, told police he has had several concussions and a few spells of being extremely confused, according to the report. She said at about 1:30 a.m. Wednesday he texted a message that cited the concussions and said, "I am sorry if I am an embarrassment."
The team's physician, Dr. Jim Borchers, said Friday that he could not comment on the medical care of student athletes. But, he said, "We are confident in our medical procedures and policies to return athletes to participation following injury or illness."
The player's sister, Sophia Karageorge, told The Columbus Dispatch that he apparently was upset, and roommates said he went for a walk, dressed in black from his hat to his boots.
"We're very concerned that he's not himself and that he maybe doesn't know what's going on," she told the newspaper.
She said after each concussion he followed trainers' instructions and received proper care but "his repercussions from (concussions) have been long-term or delayed."
She said he was without his wallet and his motorcycle.
Columbus police are investigating Karageorge's disappearance as a missing-person case, the Dispatch reported.
"Certainly a young adult male is allowed to go off the grid for any period of time," police spokesman Sgt. David Pelphrey told the newspaper. "At this point, the family has expressed some concerns, and in response to their concerns we're ramping up our efforts."
Kosta Karageorge, a former Buckeyes wrestler, joined the football team as a walk-on this season. He has played in one game and is among two dozen seniors slated to be recognized at their final home game Saturday against rival Michigan.
Ohio State coach Urban Meyer described him as a hard worker and an important player in practice.
"Our thoughts continue to be with the family of Kosta Karageorge, and we pray that he is safe and that he is found soon," Meyer said in a statement.
During halftime at the No. 16 Ohio State men's basketball game against James Madison in Columbus, pictures of Karageorge were shown and an announcement was made urging people with any information to contact police.
About 100 people gathered Friday afternoon in Columbus to spread fliers with his photo and description.

Infrastructure development is key to Maharashtra s growth: CM Devendra FadnavisTata Steel close to reopening its top iron ore mine
Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has said infrastructure development and the ease of doing of business are keys to growth in Maharashtra, while promising to bring down the number of permissions needed to start an enterprise.
“If India has to grow at 8 per cent, my state has to grow beyond 10 per cent. To achieve that, we have to develop infrastructure and improve the ease of doing business,” Fadnavis said at ET Awards function here late last evening.
The newly chief minister said his office is reviewing critical infrastructure projects on a daily basis and also announced a slew of initiatives to make doing business easier.
He said his government is working on a project to reduce the time taken to start a new business to around 3 months by reducing the number of permissions required from 76 at present, to 25.
Moreover, all work would be streamlined and done online to save more time, he said.
The government has also decided to appoint a dedicated facilitator to work as a relationship manager for every project entailing an investment of over Rs 100 crore.
Fadnavis said construction of houses and commercial space is very essential to deliver growth and added that his government is working on a scheme to reduce the time taken for permissions on this front from 180 days at present, to a mere 30 days.
On the infrastructure for Mumbai, which the government intends to develop as a global financial hub, Fadnavis said that work on multiple infrastructure projects is on and his government expects some progress shortly.
He said that his government has had discussions with the Union Ministry of Environment to start work on the coastal road on the metropolis’ western seafront, while it it hopes to get permissions to proceed with the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (MTHL) in two months.
Fadnavis said that the aim is to have a “circular road” including the coastal road and MTHL which will ease traffic movement to help solve the city’s traffic woes.
The Navi Mumbai Airport is a priority project for the government, the chief minister said, adding that land acquisition issues have been largely sorted out and the project would be fast-tracked.
Stating that businesses have been migrating to other centres like Bangalore, NCR and Hyderabad due to lack of affordable commercial space in the city, Fadnavis said that the government plan central business districts like the Bandra Kurla Complex all across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region.
The government is also serious about the rural economy and the farm sector, he said, adding that in the face of one of the worst droughts which affected over 19,000 villages, the administration is working on a plan to make Maharashtra “drought free”. However, he did not elaborate on the scheme.

Forest Owlet spotted in GhatsUpdated: November 29, 2014 23:25 IST
Forest Owlet spotted in Ghats
Alok Deshpande
endangered species
Sighting of the bird, endemic to Satpura ranges, has renewed hopes of its survival
Researchers have spotted a critically endangered ‘Forest Owlet’ in Northern part of Western Ghats, 100 km from Mumbai.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List has deemed this bird to be at a high risk of extinction. Till now, Forest Owlet was thought to be endemic to Satpura mountain ranges in central India. Its discovery in the Ghats has renewed hopes of its survival.
Naturalist Sunil Laad, associated with the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), spotted the Forest Owlet in the Tansa Wildlife Sanctuary in Maharashtra’s Palghar district in October. On subsequent study tours, visitors and conservationists to Tansa were greeted with calls of the bird around 7 km from the location. A research paper authored by Sunil Laad and Rohidas Dagale, based on this finding, will shortly be published in the Journal of BNHS (JBNHS).
Rediscovered in 1997
For nearly 113 years, the Forest Owlet was considered to be extinct, until researchers rediscovered it in 1997 in Toranmal Reserve Forest near Shahada in the Satpura in the State’s Nandurbar District.
The place where it was located is a dry deciduous forest, with open patches, which is very similar to the typical Forest Owlet habitat in the Satpura. However, this location in Tansa is partially degraded due to human disturbances.
Scientists working on Forest Owlet too are excited over the discovery. “This clearly highlights the need to conserve crucial avian habitats such as Tansa and other areas which are potential homes of the Forest Owlet,” said ornithologist Girish Jathar.

India s Economic Growth Likely to be 5.6% in FY15: CitigroupBofA-ML Sees 0.25% Rate Cut in February on Easing Inflation
New Delhi: Driven by the reforms momentum and a decline in inflation, India is expected to see a growth rate of 5.6 per cent in 2014-15 even as GDP expansion slowed in the second quarter, Citigroup has said in a report.
According to the global financial services major's report, the reform momentum after the Assembly polls and improving liquidity conditions paint a bullish picture of the economy.
For the second quarter of this fiscal year, GDP growth slowed to 5.3 per cent, from 5.7 per cent in the previous quarter (April-June).
The growth figure for the first half of this fiscal year stands at 5.5 per cent significantly higher than 4.9 per cent in the same period last year.
"The reform momentum post the assembly polls, improving liquidity conditions and project clearances prompt us to retain our full-year growth estimate of 5.6 per cent in the current financial year as against 4.7 per cent last year," the report said.
The decline in GDP growth rate in the second quarter was mainly on account of subdued performance of agriculture and manufacturing sectors.

If you buy a drone this holiday season  please watch out for planesBy Jaime Fuller November 30 Follow @j_fuller
Every holiday season brings with it a new toy that announces its reign of terror at the beginning of Black Friday. In 1996, we had Tickle Me Elmo, a toy so powerful it  led to brawls. This year, we have drones, which are popular enough that some Web sites curated all the best deals on the miniature aircrafts.
Shoppers aren't the ones who are terribly afraid of the potential terrors of drones in shopping malls. This time, the government itself is worried. According to Federal Aviation Administration records, there have been 25 incidents when drones almost collided with bigger planes. And those 25 reported cases all happened since June 25.
As the Washington Post reported last week ,
According to some estimates, half a million small drones have been sold in the United States in the past three years.
The aviation-safety agency lacks the manpower to police airports or effectively track down offenders. Only a handful of rogue drone operators have been apprehended or penalized across the country.
In order to avoid these in a future in which far more untrained Americans are becoming drone pilots, the FAA is trying to warn people not to be stupid before the holidays, as the department's head, Michael Huerta, said on CNN's "State of the Union" on Sunday.
"That is certainly a serious concern and it is something that I am concerned about," Huerta said . "That's why we are very focused on education. That's why we're also focused on enforcement. We've enforced hundreds of these cases where we have seen someone operating one of these things carelessly and recklessly and posing the danger to aircraft, and that can't happen."
The administration's pointers include sage advice like: Don't fly drones near airports. Drone pilots are also supposed to keep the unmanned aircraft in sight and not fly above 400 feet. Government officials have partnered with the  Model Aeronautics Association to make sure this information gets out to the people who need it.
"The thing that we are most concerned about is to ensure that any aircraft in this system do not come into conflict with one another," Huerta said.
The FAA also realizes that there are many companies that want the government to open up commercial use of drones. The administration has a September 2015 deadline to come up with rules for this type of drone use, which is currently prohibited
"Yes, there are proponents of unmanned aircraft and they really see huge potential with this technology and for them, we can't move fast enough," Huerta said. "What they would like to see is free and open use of unmanned aircraft as soon as we can get there."
The confusing laws that exist for drone usage were highlighted last summer when Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney(D-N.Y.) — who is a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee's Aviation subcommittee — hired a drone pilot to photograph his wedding. The drone made a cameo appearance in the congressman's Vows column.
A small drone, sounding like a swarm of locusts, swooped over the crowd, snapping pictures. “That thing is going to kill somebody,” said Huma Abedin, an aide to Hillary Rodham Clinton and a friend of Mr. Maloney, who attended with her husband, the former Congressman Anthony D. Weiner.
Jaime Fuller reports on national politics for "The Fix" and Post Politics. She worked previously as an associate editor at the American Prospect, a political magazine based in Washington, D.C.

What you missed on the Sunday shows 
Rudy Giuliani: Why did it go to a grand jury?
The former New York mayor went on "Fox News Sunday" to discuss Ferguson. He told host Chris Wallace , "This is the kind of case, had it not had the racial overtones and national publicity, where a prosecutor would have come to the conclusion that there's not enough to evidence to present to the grand jury."
 
He later acknowledged that he believed "that there is more interaction and more unfair interaction among police officers, white and black, in the black community than in a white community. And I think some of that responsibility is on the police department." But, he added,
I mean, there's no question that individual cases have situations that are unjustified. But you've got to put in proper context. Why is it happening? Why is it happening more often in the black community? And doesn't it actually logically make sense that it's going to happen more often in the community were there is five, six, seven, eight, nine times more violence than in another community?
Giuliani made similar remarks on "Meet the Press" last week, which led a professor from Georgetown to vehemently disagree with him.
 
An essay in the New York Times this Sunday focused on similar responses to what has happened in Ferguson.
“That is just as offensive as if somebody from a foreign country asked, ‘Why are you guys so outraged by the attack on the World Trade Center when Americans kill far more Americans than Al Qaeda ever has?’ ” said Antonio D. French, a St. Louis alderman who has been active in the Brown protests. “It’s just as offensive.”
Those who make that argument, he added, are typically the ones who ignore what goes on in black neighborhoods in the first place.
“We talk about it nonstop,” Mr. French, himself black, said of the crime problem.
Antonio French: "I found Officer Wilson to be remorseless, cold"
More ABC US news | ABC World News
 
Antonio French, the St. Louis alderman quoted above, was on the Sunday shows himself. He discussed Ferguson with Martha Raddatz on ABC News' "This Week." He said he did not believe Officer Darren Wilson's testimony. "I found Officer Wilson to be remorseless, cold and frankly a lot of his answers sounded like they were prepared by a lawyer," he said. "So what I worry is that, as we said back in August, that the way this trial or this — this grand jury process was being carried out by the county executive — I'm sorry — by the county prosecutor — that it really doesn't give what the community needs in order to move forward -- no closure, no resolve and, in fact, it just creates more anger."
Wilson, the police officer who shot Michael Brown, has resigned since the grand jury's decision.
Ray Kelly: Police forces need to look like the people they protect
More ABC US news | ABC World News
 
The former police commissioner of New York City also went on "This Week." Raddatz asked him how police forces could regain trust in Ferguson.
It's going to be difficult, no question about it. I think you need communication, lots of talking. And I think they have to diversify the department. I would hope that the Justice Department is going to contribute or Homeland Security will contribute some -- some money for this effort.
But you can't have a city that's two thirds African-American placed by a department of 53 police officers where only three of them are minority. It makes no sense. And I think it really -- it will refocus law enforcement on the issue of diversity, because a department that reflects the city or the municipality that it serves is much easer to police. It's smarter policing to -- to have that type of a relationship.
Ta-Nehisi Coates and Dr. James Peterson also discussed the lack of diversity in police forces across the country. Coates did not think that diversity would solve the underlying problems between the police and African-American communities.
Deval Patrick on 2016: Nah
Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick is not interested in running in the 2016 presidential race. At all.
 
He also said that he believes President Obama would like to visit Ferguson, but does not want to give the appearance of influencing the ongoing federal investigation into Michael Brown's death.
Soon-to-be senators seem really optimistic about bipartisanship.
Good luck!
President Obama's tailor has also made suits for Paul Newman, Dwight Eisenhower and Leo DiCaprio.
A bit of trivia to end: ABC News talked to a tailor who has made presidential suits for decades.

On Sunday, Reverend Al Sharpton preached at the same St. Louis church where Michael Brown's funeral service was held. Sharpton said officer Darren Wilson's resignation was not the objective in finding justice for the shooting death of Brown. (AP)
ST. LOUIS — The Rev. Al Sharpton delivered an electrifying 50-minute address — part protest message, part sermon — to a congregation of several hundred Sunday morning at Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church in St. Louis. Michael Brown’s mother, Lesley McSpadden, and his father, Michael Brown Sr., sat in the front row with several other family members.
“We lost the round, but the fight ain’t over,” Sharpton said, referring to the decision of a grand jury not to indict Officer Darren Wilson for fatally shooting Brown on Aug. 9. “You won the first round, Mr. Prosecutor, but don’t cut your gloves off, because the fight is not over. Justice will come to Ferguson!”
God works in mysterious ways, Sharpton said. The activist, preacher and television commentator said he found bits of evidence in the grand jury transcript that might help the cause of those who think the failure to indict was a mistake. For example, according to Sharpton, the record showed that Wilson “prejudged” Brown by characterizing his neighborhood as an unsavory area. And it showed Wilson wasn’t looking for the suspect who robbed cigarillos from a liquor store.
“All you’ve got to do is read the transcript,” Sharpton said. “Better yet, let a federal grand jury read the transcript.”
Referring to the family members, Sharpton said: “You can’t heal [while] leaving the injured out of the process. The afflicted is the family that remains with open wounds.”
He discounted Wilson’s resignation from the police force Saturday: “It was not about Darren Wilson’s job. It was about Michael Brown’s justice.”
“We are not anti-police,” Sharpton said. “If our children are wrong, arrest them. Don’t empty your gun and act like you had no other way.”
He urged the congregation to join peaceful protests if they haven’t already, and he chided those who burned and looted in Ferguson and neighboring communities Monday night after the grand jury announcement. “Don’t confuse them with the young folk who are standing up and marching, and the old folk,” Sharpton said. “They are the true patriots in this country, because they are asking for the system to correct itself.”
He continued: “God is going to use Michael to lead this nation to deal with police accountability. . . . Michael, they are going to know your name because you’re going to change the music of how policing is done in this country.”
Turning to a more traditional — though no less fiery — Sunday morning sermon, Sharpton took as his text one line from Amos 6: “Woe to them that are at ease in Zion.”
He challenged even the most successful and prosperous African Americans in this church and around the country to join the protest movement in any way they can. Those strivers who have made it must not remain oblivious and at ease in their success, he said.
“Ferguson is to this battle what . . . Selma was to the voting battle,” he said. “Every generation must face its battle, and it’s not going to be easy.”
In conclusion, Sharpton made a promise to the people of Ferguson and greater St. Louis: They’ll be seeing a lot of him. “Until justice shows up,” he said, “I intend to hang around.”

Brown family pastor delivers sermon days after church was guttedBy Wesley Lowery November 30 Follow @WesleyLowery
He paced back and forth. He scurried between the front row of Sunday’s makeshift sanctuary. And then he made his way to the podium, propped in an auto-loan shop’s parking lot as the soot-covered bricks of his charred church building sat to his rear.
“Even as I inhale, I still smell the smoke,” Pastor Carlton Lee said as he began. “But that’s okay. We’re not running.”
Lee, who is the Brown family pastor, fought tears as he deliver the first sermon since his church building was burned — almost completely gutted — as chaos ruled the streets in parts of Ferguson on Monday night.
The emotional service came as fundraising efforts to rebuild have topped $50,000.
“Throw us into the fiery furnace, because one thing I know is that my God will cover us,” said Chanel Lee, the church’s first lady, as she emotionally relayed the Old Testament tale of the three Israelites thrown into king’s furnace after refusing to bow to his idols. “And next time you see a hater, tell them: Don’t kill yourself trying to throw me in the fire!”
The outdoor gathering came just six days after the modest church building used by Lee’s Flood Christian Church congregation was burned. While the fire happened as parts of Ferguson were engulfed in riots and violence after the announcement that a grand jury declined to indict police officer Darren Wilson in the death of Michael Brown, Lee’s church sits far from the other damaged businesses.
Lee, who has received dozens of death treats, thinks it was a targeted attack.
Still, the pastor insisted, his congregation must show love.
“Let us hug them,” Lee said, speculating what he would do if he could confront those who set the fire, “and show them love.”
The service, attended by close to 100 people, featured representatives of Billy Graham ministries and the National Action Network, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, who vowed that the campaign for justice was just beginning.
“What happened here Monday was just a comma, not the end of the sentence,” Sharpton said.
The service comes as Ferguson attempts to turn the corner.
Most of the television cameras have left, and the looted buildings no longer smolder. Residents, business owners, community leaders and protesters alike hope that the violence is over for good. Now, they hope, they can pick up the pieces and move forward.
“Under pain and adversity, you do not run. You do not run, and you do not pick up and move,” Lee said as his congregation broke into applause. “We may have took a blow. But we’re not backing down. We’re standing right here.”

Cyber Monday cheat sheet: Whats on deck for online shoppersAn online shopper hunts for deals. (Brent Lewin/Bloomberg)
Online shoppers have already seen a bounty of deals served up on Black Thursday and Black Friday .
But Cyber Monday brings with it a fresh crop of promotions, and thus offers incentive to fire up your tablet or your laptop once again and check some gifts off your shopping list.  Here’s what you need to know if you’re planning to fill up a digital shopping cart on Monday:
*Good news for nighttime shoppers: Some of the deals are staggered this year. For anyone who sits in an office with an open floor plan, Cyber Monday can present a big conundrum:  You don’t want your cube mates (or, worse, your boss) to see you scrolling through screen after screen of knee-high leather boots or cashmere sweaters.  But you worry if you wait until after the work day to pounce, items might be sold out. Lucky for you, some retailers are trying to adapt their promotions for your 9-to-5 schedule.  Wal-Mart, for example, has announced its first ever “Evening Edition” of Cyber Monday sales , a slate of fresh deals that will come online sometime Monday night.  This batch of deals will include a Samsung 55-inch Ultra HD TV for $998 and the Hamilton Beach stand mixer for $24.   Amazon.com, meanwhile, is adding new deals every 10 minutes throughout the day. (Disclosure: The Washington Post is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.)
*Can’t shop on Monday? Don’t fret. We wrote last week about how Black Friday has bloated into several days, or even weeks, of discounts .  The same is true of Cyber Monday: Many retailers are spreading the discounts over several days, in some cases even changing the name of the promotion to “Cyber Week.”  Amazon kicked off its Cyber Monday sales on Saturday and plans for eight days of sales.  Some of the e-commerce giant’s deals include: 50 percent off Leap Frog toys, 25 percent off Philips DOT Bluetooth Speakers, and a Nest Thermostat for $199.  Wal-Mart, too, is dubbing its promotion “Cyber Week,” and is promising 500 new online deals every day through Dec. 5.  Target is also promoting a full “Cyber Week” this year and promises discounts on more than 100,000 items from Nov. 30 through Dec. 6.  Among the deals Target is touting is a KitchenAid stand mixer for $224.99, marked down from $449.99.  The retailer is also offering “buy one, get one 50 percent off” on My Little Pony and Star Wars toys.
*Buying electronics? This data can help you figure out where to go. Mobile shopping app ShopSavvy used its database of sales information to size up the deals this year.  When it comes to electronics products, ShopSavvy found that Best Buy will have the most products on sale: 638, compared to 409 of such items at Target and 257 at Wal-Mart.  Prefer to shop with whoever has the deepest discounts, not the greatest number of discounts?  ShopSavvy found that Wal-Mart will have the biggest average discounts on computers, followed by Amazon and NewEgg.com; the biggest average discounts on TVs will be at Amazon, followed by Target and then Best Buy.
 *You may have a little less shopping competition this year than last.  The National Retail Federation surveyed shoppers over Thanksgiving weekend to ask whether they planned to shop on Cyber Monday .  Fifty-two percent of respondents said they would shop on Monday, but that’s down a bit from the 54.8 percent who did so last year.
 *Any recommended reading to help me navigate the sales?  You bet.
Not sure what tech gifts should be on your list?  The Post has you covered .
You should be ready for  Elsa-mania .
Retailers are still going to be  competing intensely on price .
Retailers are in a  bigger-than-ever shipping battle  this year, and that’s creating new conveniences for you.
Interest in Cyber Monday, the biggest online shopping day of the year in the U.S, is growing globally as savvy online shoppers overseas click into the deals. (Reuters)

ESPN gives Janay Rice control over as-told-to pieceBy Erik Wemple November 30 Follow @ErikWemple
Transparency is abundant in the editor’s note appended to ESPN’s story of the long weekend. It’s a first-person essay by Janay Rice , wife of former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice, who was suspended from the NFL for hitting her in an Atlantic City hotel elevator back in February. Here’s the text of the note:
Editor’s Note: This is Janay Rice’s story, as told to ESPN’s Jemele Hill. On Wednesday, Nov. 5, Jemele interviewed Janay for three hours at the home of Janet Rice, Ray Rice’s mother, in their hometown of New Rochelle, New York. Ray Rice was not present. Janay’s account of what happened in Atlantic City, and in the months that followed, was written from Jemele’s extensive interview, as well as a phone follow-up. No questions were off limits. Janay Rice was given approval over its content and release date.
Bold text inserted to highlight two sentences that merit another editor’s note: In what universe can no questions be off limits when the subject has “approval” over the interview’s “content and release date”?
The arrangement raises a number of questions, some of which the Erik Wemple Blog has posed to ESPN. Those include whether ESPN has ever before agreed to such conditions; how ESPN reconciles the odd ground rules for the interview; and whether Janay Rice indeed used her editorial control to kill parts of her exchange with ESPN’s Jemele Hill.
ESPN indicates that it’s working on answers to the questions.
In a conversation with CNN’s Brian Stelter, Hill answered the question about the conditions this way: “I’m a journalist,” said Hill on today’s edition of “Reliable Sources. ” “And so I know people see that language and final approval and they envision this process of her shooting down things not to be in there. But it was in no way was this ever a dictatorship. It was fully a collaboration. She came into it with the mind-set that she wanted to be as transparent as possible.”
The as-told-to story furnishes evidence of that intent. For instance, Janay Rice narrates what happens after she and her then-boyfriend were bickering after dinner and drinks: “As we were arguing, he was on his phone and not looking at me. I went to reach for his phone, and when he grabbed it back, he spit at me and I slapped him,” notes the story.
Then she comes to the elevator situation: “We got into the elevator and what happened inside is still foggy to me. The only thing I know — and I can’t even say I ‘remember’ because I only know from what Ray has told me — is that I slapped him again and then he hit me. I remember nothing else from inside the elevator.”
Janay, Ray and two other couples — and some stray fans — “shared two to three bottles of liquor” that night.
Another valuable moment comes when Janay Rice discusses that infamous May 23 Ravens news conference at which she expresses some culpability for the episode.
Looking out over the media, I became angry, seeing all the people who had been covering this and adding to the story. I wanted to tell everyone what was really on my mind. When it was my turn to speak, I said I regretted my role in the incident. I know some people disagreed with me publicly apologizing. I’m not saying that what Ray did wasn’t wrong. He and I both know it was wrong. It’s been made clear to him that it was wrong. But at the same time, who am I to put my hands on somebody? I had already apologized to Ray, and I felt that I should take responsibility for what I did. Even though this followed the Ravens’ suggested script, I owned my words.
Such revelations keep this rather lengthy tell-some-things piece humming right along. Though it’s not the result of no-holds-barred journalism, it does make for good reading. Janay Rice traces her relationship with Ray Rice, how her parents relate to him, and how tense things became in the aftermath of the assault:
Later, my mother asked me privately did this ever happen before. I understood why she asked, but I was livid — probably because I was embarrassed. She told me she was not going to allow me to be in a situation like this. She said she wasn’t going to tolerate that from either one of us, and that I needed to make a decision about whether I was able to move past it. I just sat there and let her speak because I had no words. She wasn’t saying anything wrong. But I was still processing everything.
Now here’s something else: Janay Rice reveals that in a June 16 meeting with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and others, “Ray told the commissioner, and his colleagues, everything that happened. There was no reason to lie because we knew that there was a video and we assumed the NFL knew what was in it, even though we didn’t know whether or not they saw it.”
That little tidbit bears considerably on the world of ESPN. Here’s why: In a CBS News interview and in a news conference , Goodell suggested that he didn’t know on a detailed level what had happened in that elevator until TMZ released the video from inside the elevator on Sept. 8. He said he’d gleaned fresh information from that video — information that he’d used to impose an indefinite suspension on Rice (which was recently overturned ). ESPN’s Bill Simmons wasn’t buying the notion that Goodell hadn’t known what had gone down, so he called him a “liar” on a podcast and ended up getting suspended for three weeks .
Janay Rice’s first-person account makes that particular suspension look weak.
Now back to the question at hand, which is whether ESPN cheated its audience by allowing this sweetheart interview deal. The answer is, probably. Thanks to the deal’s terms, we won’t know what revelations didn’t get passed along. What is there, however, is quite compelling. ESPN extended these interviewing courtesies not to the commissioner of the NFL nor to a violent NFL player; had it done so, the howl from the Internet would just be getting started. Instead, it extended these courtesies to a victim of domestic violence — albeit one who’s trying to clear the way for her husband’s return to the playing field: “No matter how long we have known each other and no matter what the circumstance is, Ray understands that violent behavior like this, even one time, is never acceptable,” notes Janay Rice in the piece. “Ray told the truth and has fully accepted responsibility for his actions, which allowed us to work together at improving ourselves and get to the better place we are today.”
A firmer judgment will be possible once NBC’s “Today” show finishes airing its Matt Lauer interview with Janay Rice on Monday and Tuesday. Will Lauer manage to probe all those things omitted from the ESPN piece? An NBC News spokeswoman told the Erik Wemple Blog that the session carried no conditions whatsoever. Here’s a preview:
UPDATE 8:45 p.m.: ESPN has responded to a few of our questions:
1) Has anyone at ESPN ever agreed to such conditions before?
Like many other media outlets, we have done “as told to” pieces before. Obviously, in each instance, you need to consider how important and newsworthy the story is and the related parameters. In this case, there were zero limitations on the questions we asked and we were extremely transparent about the process.
2) The word is that no questions were off limits, but Janay Rice had final say over the content; doesn’t that mean that some questions (or at least answers) were indeed off limits?
There were no limitations on questions and the interview lasted nearly 3 hours. Additionally, there were certain elements we insisted be in the piece. Another important factor that everyone involved was aware of is that we reserved the right to walk away from the whole thing at any point if we weren’t comfortable with it.
3) What considerations convinced you to allow these conditions? Was it just that Janay Rice is a private person, not an NFL player or official?
It’s obviously an extremely important and newsworthy story. We considered many factors and had a lot of internal discussions before ultimately determining we would explore this option with the understanding we could walk away at any point if we weren’t comfortable.
Left unanswered was this question: Did Janay Rice exercise her authority to delete anything from the piece?

Gruden regrets fourth-and-inches callBy Mike Jones November 30 Follow @mikejoneswapo
Despite a decent performance, Colt McCoy could not pull out a victory for the Redskins, as they lost, 49-27, against the Indianapolis Colts. The Washington Post's Gene Wang and Dan Steinberg discuss how the lackluster defense was mostly to blame. (Kyle Barss/The Washington Post)
If he had to do it all over again, Jay Gruden said he would have still gone for it on fourth and inches in the third quarter. But he does regret the play that he called for in that situation, which ended disastrously.
With his team down 28-17 with 7 minutes 39 seconds left in the third quarter and the ball at the Washington 41 , Gruden kept his offense on the field to attempt a first down. The Colts called a timeout, and then Washington lined up in run formation. The ball was snapped and as quarterback Colt McCoy performed a play-action fake to Alfred Morris on the right, Colts linebacker Erik Walden came off the right edge unblocked.
The linebacker engulfed McCoy, knocking the ball free as he hit him from behind. Fellow linebacker D’Qwell Jackson scooped up the loose ball and ran 35 yards for a touchdown that gave the Colts a 35-17 lead.
Gruden said he had two play calls for that situation, but that he switched from his first.
Quarterback Colt McCoy, left, is on the ground afterIndianapolis outside linebacker Erik Walden caused a fumble that was run back for a touchdown on a fourth-and-one play late in the third quarter. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post)
“I thought we had to go for it there,” Gruden said. “Originally, I had a nice inside power play called, and then when they took the timeout, I saw they lined up and I saw they had a guy play bump and run on DeSean [Jackson] with a safety — not much help. So, I decided on a play-action pass and launch it to DeSean and try to get it. I got a little greedy. That’s all I can say, and we blew the protection.”
Walden lined up outside of fellow linebacker Bjoern Werner, who settled in opposite of tight end Logan Paulsen. Paulsen had lined up next to left tackle Trent Williams.
At the snap, Paulsen engaged Werner, leaving Williams pinned on the inside and with no one to block. Walden came untouched.
Both Gruden and Paulsen said after the game that the tight end should have picked up Walden.
“Our tight end should’ve fanned out there [blocking Walden], our tackle should’ve fanned out there [blocking Werner],” the coach explained. “They both should’ve went out to help. It didn’t happen though. It was unfortunate. It was a big play in the game, though. That’s for sure. Should’ve caught it. Shouldn’t have run it. Should have done something other than what I did.”

Modi s tall promises meet big challengesA K Bhattacharya: Modi's tall promises meet big challenges
A K Bhattacharya | New Delhi Nov 30, 2014 09:48 PM IST
Three governance-related developments in the past week eloquently highlight the challenges that the Narendra Modi government will face in the coming days. It is important to note that these challenges have surfaced because the government has shown greater resolve to get down to the serious business of reviving investment sentiment and improving the state of the Indian economy.
The first development pertains to the government's stance on its efforts to tackle black money. There is no doubt that the Modi government has showed greater urgency in unearthing unaccounted money stashed away by some Indians in tax havens and other countries, enjoying the advantages of the latter's banking secrecy laws. This could be attributed to the increasing Supreme Court pressure on it and also to the realisation that it had made a rather tall promise during the Lok Sabha election campaign that it would be able to soon bring back the black money that some Indians had kept in foreign countries.
To be fair to the new government, one of the first decisions it took after its formation was to set up the Special Investigation Team (SIT) to track the various black money cases. This, too, was an outcome of a Supreme Court directive. But as Finance Minister Arun Jaitley revealed last week, the government had acted quite swiftly to hand over to the SIT a list of all the individuals with foreign bank accounts as early as June.
Investigation into these accounts also seems to have made some progress, but the problem is not with the work the government has done so far, but with the tall promises it made when it was in the Opposition in its bid to win an election. If the Modi government appears to be on the back foot on the black money issue, it is because of what it did and how it behaved when it was in the Opposition. The challenge for the government now will be to convince the Opposition political parties in both the houses of Parliament that it is more than serious in tracking black money cases and punishing the guilty. But more importantly, it will have to convince everybody that tackling the menace of black money is not a matter of 100 days. This requires sustained policy response to both prevent incentives and eliminate the scope for generating black money, quite apart from bringing to book those who are guilty of the crime.
The second development was the statement made by the government's Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi, that there was no need for appealing the Mumbai High Court verdicts that had found foreign companies not violating transfer pricing norms. This was a setback for the revenue department in the finance ministry, which had hoped that it would be able to appeal the Mumbai High Court verdict and help boost revenues, whose collections in the current year have been poor so far.
The attorney general's statement has certainly revived the confidence of foreign investors, who had begun nursing fears about the adversarial tax regime in this country, after reports came out that the government might go in for an appeal against the Mumbai High Court verdicts. But the challenge here is the clamour of protests this decision might provoke among the Opposition political parties and even the possibility of some adverse comments from the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, who in his report next year might point out how the government lost potential revenue because of the attorney general's stand. The Modi government must be prepared to face both these challenges.
The third development is the meeting that the cabinet secretary held along with a clutch of his top secretaries and industry leaders to discuss how the manufacturing sector can be revived and stalled projects can get off the ground. Two suggestions made by industry representatives at this meeting deserve serious consideration. One, it is not enough for the Centre to relax laws to facilitate quick investment. The states, too, need to be taken on board in this drive to facilitate investments. Two, the government must develop a relationship of trust with industry, so that the latter does not have an adversarial relationship with the former.
It will not be easy for the Modi government to tackle these challenges. How well it does that will largely determine how successful it is in the coming days in reviving the economy.

Indo-Bangla land swap deal will serve long-term security interests of the state: ModiWritten by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati |
Posted: December 1, 2014 12:06 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 10:28 am
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday announced that his government would not compromise on national security and utilise land transfer agreement with Bangladesh in a manner that it serves the long-term security interests of the state. It might seem to be an immediate loss to Assam, but the state would benefit in the long run, Modi, allaying apprehensions over the Indo-Bangla land swap deal, said.
“The government will utilise the India-Bangla land transfer agreement to seal all routes across the international border through which illegal Bangladeshi migrants have been entering Assam and creating havoc in the state,” he said.
Addressing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers here at the end of his two-day hectic trip to Assam, Modi also claimed that his government has been able to convert development into a national agenda prompting all other parties to push issues like caste, creed, religion and language to the back.

Asking the people of Assam to have faith in him, Modi said, “There will be no compromise on Assam’s security.” He also promised to fulfil the promises he had made to the people of Assam during Lok Sabha elections. “I know the sentiments of the people of Assam. We will always protect the interests of Assam and the country, he said. Modi however did not make any commitment on the Bangladeshi influx issue and carefully avoided recalling his announcemebt during the election campaign in April that Bangladeshi migrants would have to pack up afte May 16.
He however issued a stern warning to forces trying to harm the interests of Assam and the Northeast region and said that law would not spare them now. “Such forces should know that the government has changed in Delhi and the law will not spare them now,” he said. The development of the entire northeast region including Assam was a priority of his government, Modi added.
The Prime Minister also claimed that the BJP has compelled all other political parties to make development the prime issue instead of issues like caste, creed and region. “We have turned the issue of development into everybody’s agenda across the country,” he said. The country, Modi claimed, has seen performance and agenda of the government run by all others parties including the Congress, the Left parties, regional parties and coalitions and they have now seen the BJP-led government at the Centre.

BETH!! The longshot, going off at 22-1! Who bet the mortgage?
Offspring of the deceased Hershel, sister of still-breathing Maggie, friend of Daryl, singer of Tom Waits ballads, wallflower turned tough chick. Beth. Dead of a point-blank chin-to-skull headshot from Evil Cop Dawn, in a hallway of Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, in roughly year two of the zombie apocalypse. Services will be private, with likely not even a deviled egg in sight. Now if you will turn to page 222 of your hymnal, we shall stand and sing…

Beth.
Rick and the crew had set up hostage negotiations with Dawn. They would trade the two cops they had lured into a hostage trap in exchange for Beth and Carol. (Oh. That cop, Bob Lamson, who had okey-doked Sasha last week? Rick ran him down in a police cruiser, shot him in the head and told him to “shut up.” It was POETRY.)
The swap takes place in the hospital. But then, when the deal was done, Dawn gets all chesty and tells Rick that he has to give back Noah (“Everybody Hates Chris”) since some of her cops went to fetch him and one died. That was a non-starter with Rick, but Noah agrees in order to keep the peace. Beth runs forward to give him a hug. Dawn, standing a few feet away, mutters “I knew you’d be back” at Noah, a line of contempt.
Beth’s nostrils flare. She lets go of Noah. Steps to Dawn, says, “I get it now,” referring to Dawn’s power plays that always sacrifice others … and stabs her in the chest with a pair of hidden scissors! Dawn shoots her on reflex, sending the top of Beth’s head to the ceiling!
Dawn looks up at our gore-spattered gang and mutely tries to explain … and the last thing she sees on Earth is the avenging angel of Daryl Dixon, who blows her brains out of the back of her head with a kill shot just above the eyes.
Beth.
It was certainly one of the Top 10 moments in the show’s five-year run, and TWD has risen to the top of the ratings heap for just this sort of brutal reason — a ruthless hour of narrative drive with an emotional gut-punch every now and again. The next episode is not until February, and there appears to be no reason it won’t resume its ratings domination.
In last week’s betting guide, we theorized that while certain iconic characters were safe — Rick, Carl, Michonne, Daryl, Carol — Beth was the least likely of the rest to die. (Rosita, going at 8-5, was the favorite, closely followed by Abraham and Eugene.) Beth had toughened up considerably this year in her travails at the hospital, and that was what led to her demise.
Dawn, true, buggered the hostage deal. But Beth overreached, going with emotion over tactics, too confident in her fledgling strength. It was like seeing your kid sister trying to grow up too fast. Which in a way, is exactly the role that Beth had filled on the show — rural innocence, trying to cope with a vicious new reality. TWD, smartly, executed the most appealing character they could afford to lose.
Briefly, the rest: Abe and his splinter group went back to the church, picking up Father Gabe, Michonne, Carl and Judith. They went to Atlanta to help with the rescue, arriving at the hospital just as the rest of the crew was walking out. Daryl, weeping, is carrying Beth’s body. Maggie collapses.
In the last minute, we cut to Morgan, looking like a wandering mystic, finding his way through the woods to Father Gabe’s church, via the markings on the trees. He stumbles across the map that Abe had left for Rick, which spelled out his name. Morgan, recognizing it, freezes. Cut to black.
But alas and also lackaday, TWD fam. We lost our kid sis. It’s gonna leave a mark.

How rare are online threat prosecutionsBy Orin Kerr December 1
In an essay in the New York Times Magazine on Elonis v. United States , the Facebook threat case to be argued Monday involving the interstate threat statute, Emily Bazelon writes that the rarity of online threat prosecutions is a reason to be wary of the defense’s First Amendment claims:
The truth is that even when intent to do harm seems obvious, online threats are rarely prosecuted. Citron looked at the federal law that is the basis for the Elonis case and found that it has been enforced fewer than 50 times, online and off, over the past eight years. Stalking laws, domestic-violence advocates say, aren’t enforced much, either.
If the Supreme Court requires evidence of a speaker’s intent to harm in true-threats cases, it could give the police and prosecutors one more reason not to bring them. Maybe that’s simply the unavoidable consequence of a broad interpretation of the First Amendment. Let’s be clear, though, that such an approach to free speech doesn’t come free. The choice in this case between points of view — Anthony’s or Tara’s — mirrors another choice, between types of personal liberty. His or hers.
I don’t think that’s right. Elonis was prosecuted under the interstate threat statute, 18 U.S.C. § 875(c). The Bureau of Justice Statistics keeps stats on how often different federal crimes were charged. Running the numbers for § 875(c) for the last eight years the numbers are available — 2005 to 2012 — shows 242 cases closed involving § 875(c) . Some of those are non-Internet cases, like old-fashioned telephone threats, but my sense is that more and more are online threats. And that’s just § 875(c): Other Internet threats are charged under different federal statutes, such as 47 U.S.C. § 223(a)(1)(E). Plus, many other threat cases are state cases prosecuted under state threat laws.
Internet threat prosecutions aren’t the most common prosecution of online conduct. But they’re not as rare as Bazelon’s essay suggests, and my sense is that at least some prosecutors take these cases pretty seriously.
(Full disclosure: A few months ago, I provided a very small amount of assistance to co-blogger John Elwood, counsel of record for Elonis, in the Elonis case.)
UPDATE: I fiddled with the post a bit shortly after putting it up.

Bangladesh to source 600 MW more power from IndiaTata Steel close to reopening its top iron ore mine
India is in the final stage of concluding a deal with Bangladesh for sale of 100 MW of power from ONGC Tripura Power Company and has started talks for sale of another 500MW to the neighbouring nation by 2016 as Dhaka seeks to source more power from regional suppliers to meet its rising energy demand, said Tawfiq-e-Elahi Choudhury Bir Bikram, advisor to Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on power, energy and natural resource affairs.
Bangladesh is planning to source about 5,000 MW of power from regional suppliers like India, Nepal and Butan over the next few years.
“We are yet to decide on the tariff for power purchase under the deals currently being discussed but we hope it would be favourable to us,” said C Choudhur . On a visit to the state, he told select reporters that Bangladesh faces a peak time power shortage of about  5-10% and would look for large power purchase deals as its energy requirement is expected to go up further in line with consumption and higher economic activity.  The weighted average tariff of Bangladesh’s power purchase deals now works out to about 6.5 Taka.
Choudhury said the Bangladesh economy is growing at about 6% a year and would have greater appetite for sourcing energy from India. Already it is buying 500 MW from NTPC’s West Bengal plants. Once the final power purchase deals currently being negotiated are executed, Bangladesh would be buying 1100MW from India. For India, Bangladesh is a nearby ready market for the energy produced in the North Eastern region, which is geographically removed from the industrial hubs in the country.
Choudhury is in Tripura to participate in the dedication of ONGC Tripura Power Company (OTPC) at Palatana to the nation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Bangladesh is exploring co-operation in the energy sector which also covers exploration of oil and gas and joint development of hydro-power with India.
OTPC, a joint venture among state run oil and gas explorer, Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Limited (IL&FS) and the Tripura government, has now a capacity of 726.6 MW and supplies power to the entire North Eastern region. The company seeks to provide energy to industrialisation efforts in the area as it would be unviable for ONGC to transport the gas it produces from this region to the markets in more industrial parts of the country.

Designer duo Rohit Gandhi and Rahul Khanna on their new flagship storeWritten by Somya Lakhani | Mumbai |
Posted: December 1, 2014 12:00 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 12:06 pm
About 17 years ago, two boys went to London and were amazed to see concept stores mushrooming on the streets. There was a tie store, even a socks store, and as they walked through town, they decided to open a shirt store called H20 back home in Delhi. Today, it has evolved into a label that many swear by, and the two wandering boys — Rahul Khanna and Rohit Gandhi — are regarded as westernwear veterans. “It’s a global silhouette, hence what we do is global wear,” corrects Khanna, at the duo’s spacious week-old flagship store in Defence Colony, Delhi.
The capacious building that houses their store is a reflection of Khanna and Gandhi’s fashion sensibilities — minimalistic and clean, with some classy metallics at play. Mannequins with bouquets of flowers instead of heads welcome you to the first floor that displays a line of formal shirts from their menswear pret label H2O, cocktail jackets, suits and sober sherwanis with just a dash of bling, while downstairs, it’s all about sassy and chic tops, dresses and gowns in their customary grey, silver, black and ash. “Delhi is our base and we wanted a large store here. We’ve been on this street for eight years now with our womenswear pret label, Cue. We recently shut down that store and are slowly merging Cue with our other label called Rohit Gandhi+Rahul Khanna. The added advantage with this new space is that we have both menswear and womenswear under one roof. Fifteen years ago, women bought clothes for men but now, men buy for themselves and are particular about their style,” says Gandhi. The price range of the garments on display at the store is between Rs 3,250 and Rs 75,000.
At a time when social media initiatives and PR-driven events are driving the fashion industry in the country, the two have maintained a rather low profile. They even skipped two seasons of the fashion week in Delhi, causing a fair amount of curiosity in the circle. “While it seems like we haven’t been around much the last year or so, we’ve actually been swamped with work. Apart from this store, we started a line of Indian wear, another store in Mumbai is on the cards, and we have strengthened our international presence by showcasing in Paris, Shanghai and New York. We now have an agent in New York and are selling from 75 stores internationally,” says Khanna.
The last few years have been about bittersweet realisations for Khanna and Gandhi and the international exposure showed them the loopholes back home. “Internationally, designers are just that — designers. Marketing, PR and the business side is taken care of by companies and supported by the government. Here, we are the entrepreneurs too. This needs to change,” he adds. On the other hand, a day-long exhibition in Raipur a month ago brought them closer to a new market, one that they are eager to tap. “We had no expectations from the pop-up in Raipur but ended up selling 85 garments in one day. There’s a huge market in Tier-II and Tier-III cities, but opening a store there is difficult because of lack of infrastructure and man power,” says Gandhi, adding, “the Fashion Design Council of India needs to do their bit to spread awareness in these towns and cities, and as member of the board, I’d like to work on this.”
A walk through the new store or any of their runway shows depict their affinity with a subtle colour palette, a penchant for sharp, clean cuts and some sophisticated shine. Interestingly, this also reflects in the Indian wear they now sell online. “Our aesthetics are the same and our Indian collection is in line with our western wear. There is no split personality disorder here. We are working on a line of saris, but I don’t see us doing a bridal garment in the near future. We start sometimes, but lose interest quickly,” says Gandhi.
Apart from being loaded with work, the two also sound a tad disillusioned with the way the industry works in the country. “We needed a break to find ourselves again, also the fashion weeks here got a bit boring with the same people and the same venues,” says Khanna.
But now, it’s time for them to return to a familiar runway and the duo has already begun work on their Autumn-Winter 2015 collection to be showcased at the fashion week in Delhi early next year.
Over 17 years, Gandhi and Khanna have managed to create a classy brand, an art gallery, and a formidable presence in the fashion circle.
Even when they skip a fashion week, they encourage their favourites from the front row. “We have identical choices, design sensibilities and the same likes and dislikes; it’s scary. But not a day goes by without an argument. It’s healthy and now we are so used to each other. It works,” says Gandhi.

Assam groups angry over Modi stand on Bangla land swapWritten by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati |
Posted: December 1, 2014 12:18 pm | Updated: December 1, 2014 12:24 pm
Narendra Modi may have left a deep impression in the minds of the people of Assam during his two-day maiden visit to the state after taking over as prime minister six months ago. But his stand on the land transfer agreement between India and Bangladesh – in which some portion of Assam land would go to the other country – have left many unhappy.
Particularly sore are the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU), Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), Asom Jatiyabadi Yuva-Chatra Parishad (AJYCP) and Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSSS), all of which have hit out at Modi for allegedly changing the BJP’s stand on the issue. Modi had in a party rally here on Sunday said his government would utilize the Indo-Bangla land swap agreement to curb further infiltration from Bangladesh.
“The people of Assam clearly remember that while Narendra Modi had gone record saying he was opposed to land transfer to Bangladesh, the BJP had even called a bandh to protest the then prime minister Manmohan Singh’s pact with Hasina,” said Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) president Atul Bora. “This announcement of Modi has once again vindicated our stand that there is no basic difference between BJP and Congress in relation to their outlook on Assam,” Bora added.
The All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) on the other hand termed Modi’s latest stand on the Indo-Bangla land transfer pact as a betrayal. “The prime minister, whose party had so long opposed ttransfer of Assam’s land to Bangladesh, has openly betrayed the people of Assam. We strongly oppose his stand. Whatver portion of land India is supposed to get back from Bangladesh is also our land, whatever portion the government wants to give away to that country is also ours,” said AASU president Sankar Prasad Roy and general secretary Tapan Kumar ogoi in a statement here last evening.
Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) president Akhil Gogoi and AJYCP president Manoj Barua have also criticized the prime minister for his alleged “changed” stand on the land transfer deal with Bangladesh. “How did the prime minister forget that the BJP leaders had unfurled the national flag on those patches of land on the border which are supposed to transferred to Bangladesh?” asked AJYCP president Manoj Barua.
According to the pact, altogether 665 acres of land was under adverse possession of both countries. Assam will regain 397.5 acres of land while Bangladesh will get 267.5 acres following the land transfer agreement. The agreement is also expected to ensure demarcation and erection of fencing on the unfenced 2.86-km stretch in the Lathitilla-Dumabari sector in Karimganj district in southern Assam along the Indo-Bengal border.

London: Two UK researchers are sending dozens of family photographs to be clicked on the edge of space in what they call the "ultimate space selfie".
The former PhD students from Sheffield, Alex Baker and Chris Rose, will send almost anything you want to space - and snap it there.
They have been sending up "payloads" to the edge of space, including a diamond ring, numerous promotional gimmicks, toy cars and newspaper front pages.

They have also sent dozens of family photographs in what they call the "ultimate space selfie".
Since their first launch in 2011 the two engineers have developed a GPS tracking system to collect their payloads after they land and now charge businesses up to 4,000 pounds to send packages to space and back.
They have even had talks with a funeral home about sending ashes into space, 'The Independent' reported.
They also offer a Do it yourself (DIY) kit for customers to launch their own space balloons for less than 500 pounds.
The tricky part is collecting the payload, which comes down after about three hours. The pair use wind charts and meteorological data to predict the landing. So far, they have only lost one item.

Hyundai s November sales rise 8.7% to 54 011 unitsHyundai's November sales rise 8.7% to 54,011 units
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: December 1, 2014  | 14:35 IST
Hyundai Motor India on Monday reported a 8.7 per cent increase in total sales at 54,011 units in November 2014.
The company had sold 49,681 units in the same month last year, it said in a statement.
In the domestic market, Hyundai sold 35,511 units last month as compared to 33,501 units in November 2013, up six per cent.
During the month, Hyundai's exports increased 14.7 per cent to 18,500 units as against 16,180 units in the same period last year.
Commenting on the sales performance, HMIL Senior Vice President (Sales and Marketing) Rakesh Srivastava said strong investment of launching four new products in a year's time has resulted in the growth.
"Today, Hyundai has one of the youngest product portfolio lead by Elite i20 which has reached a landmark number of 10,500 units making it the top seller among strong Hyundai brands," he added.

Office space demand grows 58% in Sept qtr: JLLCOO Business and International Director
(Office space demand in India…)
NEW DELHI: Office space demand in India saw a net absorption of 9.3 million sq ft in the July-September quarter this year, says a report.
This is nearly 58 per cent higher than the year-ago period, according to the report by property consultant Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL).
"The Indian monsoon months are synonymous with low activity in real estate , but this year witnessed considerable amount of activity in the office sector," JLL India COO Business and International Director Ramesh Nair said.
He said that led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi , the new government which came to power with majority in May, has infused renewed confidence and faith in the corporate world.
Market activity, measured in gross leasing volume (GLV), was also high at 10.62 million sq ft, clearly indicating that there are better days ahead for commercial realty, Nair added.
According to JLL India, grade A office leasing market is dominated by US multi-national companies, which account for more than 45 per cent of leased space).
These companies, along with Europe-based MNCs account for 15 per cent of share in office space leasing, are once again very bullish about growing their businesses in India after the new government took over.
"Indian companies, accounting for 30 per cent of office space leasing, are slightly behind in executing their growth plans; however, we know that several of them are in various stages of their property hunt," the report said.
Bangalore and Delhi NCR led the revival with the leasing of almost 3 million sq ft and 2.5 million sq ft space respectively. Another city that rose on the office realty map was Kolkata , leasing more than half a million sq ft from virtually no leasing during the same time last year.
Mumbai, Chennai, Pune and Hyderabad maintained their quantum of leasing space with minor variation, the report said.
With a healthy space demand list on hand from various large companies, it is going to be hard for corporates to find the right assets at the right locations.
"Next year, we expect only 22 million sq ft of office space to be ready at the right locations against the demand forecast of just under 30 million sq ft in 2015," Nair said.

Fatmi slams Modi govt over Sanskrit row; mocks BJP over Independence struggle roleSaudi cleric's wife shows face on TV, sparking uproar
Sanskrit should not be promoted at the cost of other regional languages, said former HRD minister M A A Fatmi, who also accused the Narendra Modi-led government’s education policy as ‘backward and insular’.
“It is a welcome step that the government has decided to promote Sanskrit but this should not be done hastily at the cost of other regional languages,” Former Union HRD Minister of State M A A Fatmi said today.
“We will support the government if it opens Sanskrit schools, colleges and universities at suitable places all over the country. However, if the government goes ahead with its policy of making Sanskrit compulsory as it is doing in the case of Kendriya Vidyalayas, it would only lead to resistance amongst students,” former RJD’s National General Secretary said.
Fatmi also accused the Bharatiya Janata Party-led (BJP) government at the Centre of following a backward and insular education policy.
“Modi had claimed that he would take the country forward into the 21st century by following a progressive policy in the vital field of education. Unfortunately, however, the very opposite is taking place,” Fatmi told reporters here.
“What we are seeing is that instead of inducting the best and the brightest educationists, the present government is hastily filling all vital posts with men belonging to the RSS, who carry out outdated ideas,” he claimed.
“Another very alarming move is that of trying to encroach up on the autonomy of important centres of higher education, including the Aligarh Muslim University. The subtle manner in which the BJP tried to use the issue of AMU central library and now the issue of freedom fighter Raja Mahendra Pratap, to needle the AMU, does not auger well,” he said.
Fatmi said,”if the government is really serious about honouring Raja Mahendra Pratap then I would strongly recommend that the government should honour him and his closest associate Maulana Barkatullah Khan with the Bharat Ratna. I can safely say that both of them deserve it. This would be better than trying to use communalism and casteism for polarizing society merely for political gains.”
“The BJP is a party without icons and one-by-one they are trying to appropriate secular icons like Raja Mahendra Pratap who had nothing to do with the BJP’s communal agenda. Raja Mahendra Pratap had always opposed the Jana Sangh tooth and nail. They do not have a single leader worth the name who took part in the national movement for freedom of the country,” he alleged.

Club batsman sacrifices record to pay tribute to PhillipHughesBy: Press Trust of India | Victoria |
Posted: December 1, 2014 3:51 pm | Updated: December 1, 2014 4:09 pm
A batsman in a club match in Victoria has paid a touching tribute to Phillip Hughes by deciding to sacrifice breaking a long-standing record.
According to a report in The Courier Mail, Shaun McArthur, captain of Ballarat club side Haddon, was batting on 220 and was blazing his way to the club’s all-time batting record in a match against local rivals VRI Delacombe, but decide to retire after glancing at the scoreboard.
His teammates were stunned by his decision but realised their skipper’s move when they looked at the scoreboard.
Haddon were on 408, which was Hughes’ Test number for Australia, and there had been 63 overs bowled.
Hughes was batting on 63 when he was fatally struck by a Sean Abbott bouncer.
After that ’63 not out’ has become a preferred way to pay tribute to Hughes as junior club cricketers across Australia were encouraged to retire on 63.
“Everyone walked up and shook his hand,” Haddon club spokesman Vincent McDonald told The Courier.
“It was a chance innings. You can’t plan to have scores like this 220 runs for a player and 408 (total) in the standard of cricket we play.
“Shaun must’ve just noticed the score and thought, ‘That’ll do’.”

Lionel Richie confirmed for Glastonbury2015By: Press Trust of India | London |
Posted: December 1, 2014 3:36 pm
Veteran soul singer Lionel Richie has been confirmed to play Glastonbury 2015. The 65-year-old singer, whose hits include ‘Easy’, ‘Hello’ and ‘All Night Long’, will play the Sunday teatime slot, which has hosted Kenny Rogers, Paul Simon and Dolly Parton in recent years, reported Guardian online.
“I am really excited to play Glastonbury next year as it is one of the most iconic festivals in the world,” said Richie. “It has a phenomenal history and the alumni of artists who have previously played is incredible so I am honoured to be joining that club. It will be a really special moment for me and I can’t wait to share it with everyone. I can now say ‘Yes, I am playing Glastonbury’,” he added.
Richie is the first big-name artist announced for Glastonbury 2015, and festival organiser Emily Eavis said she was thrilled with the booking. “He is one of the great soul legends. He has got all the songs, some incredible songs, and I think he will get people on their feet. There will be a lot of love out there for Lionel.”
The Sunday afternoon slot, which caters for music industry legends, has grown in stature over the last decade. Past performers include James Brown, Leonard Cohen and Brian Wilson, who played an emotional set as the sun finally came out during 2005’s particularly muddy year.
Eavis believes that Dolly Parton’s standout performance at this year’s festival, which drew a huge crowd, has helped open the door for even bigger acts in the future. Richie will be embarking on a series of European dates from February next year, and arrives in the UK at the end of that month. This year’s Glastonbury festival has already sold out, with all 150,000 tickets snapped up in record time after they were put on sale in October.

New HIV cases down by 57%  India now aims for zeroinfectionBy: Press Trust of India | New Delhi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 3:34 pm | Updated: December 1, 2014 4:40 pm
The number of new HIV infections in India has come down by 57 per cent and related deaths by 25 per cent in the last decade with the government now working to achieve the ambitious global goals of zero new infection and death by raising awareness and boosting preventive methods.
On World AIDS Day, Union Health Minister J P Nadda today sought people’s involvement to make the mission success, saying governments or NGOs alone cannot deal with the challenge successfully.
Launching the helpline number – 1097, a digital resource centre and a supply chain management system for HIV patients, Nadda said, “It’s the work of every individual to come out and fight it (HIV) out. There should be zero discrimination against people with HIV. This should be our commitment.”
Stressing on the importance of “restraint” and “precaution”, he said it was time for people to consider their lifestyle, noting that preventive health care has become important after an era when it was considered that antibiotics can “cure everything”.
“We should be working on two fronts. We should be aware and put special emphasis on prevention and help those living with HIV and AIDS so that they face no discrimination,” he said in his address.
Health Ministry, he said, had signed MoUs with 11 central ministries for better coordination in tackling AIDS and MoUs with five more ministries are in pipeline. “The work involves bringing on board 28 ministries,” he said.
The first HIV positive person was reported in 1986 in India which currently has 2.1 million affected people, the third highest in the world even as the country’s efforts in restricting its spread is considered a success by most.
Health Secretary Lov Verma said HIV-related deaths have come down by 30 percent since 2007.
UNAIDS Country Coordinator Oussama Tawil said India should work to ensure that 90 percent of people with HIV should know that they suffer from this condition, 90 percent of them should be covered by treatment and 90 percent of those being treated should have a positive health impact on their lives.

Jharkhand polls: Round Two to distinctly reflect tribal mood and urban voting trendsSandeep Shrivastwa , IBNLive.com | Dec 01, 2014 at 02:46pm IST
Jharkhand will count its millions of votes on December 23 and at the end of Tuesday's Round Two of Assembly elections, voters of 43 out of the total 81 constituencies will seal the fate of their candidates in EVMs.
By Tuesday evening, it will be pretty much clear who the tribals will reject and what will be the trend of polling in urban areas - this phase has maximum number of tribal seats and two urban constituencies.
Here's a detailed analysis of the phase two of state polls:
With 16 out of the 20 constituencies reserved for tribals, all the major players, including the non-tribal parties are wooing voters with tribal-friendly promises.
* Maximum seats and largest number of ST constituencies
With 16 out of the 20 constituencies reserved for tribals, all the major players, including the non-tribal parties are wooing voters with tribal-friendly promises. This phase has the highest number of constituencies among all the five phases. All star campaigners, including Prime Minister Modi and Congress leaders Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, have played the tribal card. While Modi claims it was the BJP that made a separate state for tribals, Rahul Gandhi promises tribals their right over land and resources.
In 2009, out of these 20 seats, BJP had eight, JMM five, Congress two and rest were held by Indendents.
* Prestige of two ex-CMs and 10 former ministers at stake
Former chief ministers Arjun Munda and Madhu Koda are trying their luck in the second round of polls. Madhu Koda who is in jail and facing graft charges is contesting from behind the bars from Jagannathpur seat.
Three-time former CM and sitting Kharsawan MLA Arjun Munda's main rival is Dashrath Gagrai who defected from JVM to JMM.
Ten former state ministers including Enos Ekka, Joba Manjhi, Geetashree Oraon, Raghuvar Das, Champai Soren, Vimla Pradhan, Banna Gupta, Dulal Bhuiyan and Bandhu Tirki, are also in the fray.
* Urban constituencies
The first truly urban constituencies going to polls in the ongoing elections are Jamshedpur (East) and Jamshedpur (West). These elections are important because they will show the trend of polling in big urban areas like Dhanbad and Ranchi.
* Number of candidates low
Jharkhand elections have been known for two reasons - Independents play an important role and dummy candidates are fielded to confuse voters.
Total 300 candidates contested from these 20 seats in 2009, but this year the number has gone down to 227. The number of Independent candidates has decreased from 94 to 62.
Major parties have accepted the fact that this election will witness a direct contest in most of the constituencies. Political analysts say this is happening because parties have shied away from fielded dummy candidates this time. Dummy candidates are an old trick to eat into votes of rivals.
* 9 of the 20 seats are Naxal-hit
Nine out of the 20 seats are badly hit by Naxal activities. The Election Commission has made special arrangements for these nine seats. Four helipcopters - one Dhruva and three MI-17 choppers have been deployed to make the task of 40,000 security forces easy in the second phase of elections. Conduction elections have never been easy in Sisai, Simdega, Kolebira, Tamar, Torpa, Khunti, Mandar and neighbouring areas.
* Crorepati candidates
Among the super rich candidates, Congress' Khunti candidate Pushpa Surin tops the list. The number of crorepati candidates in phase two is 37, six less than fist phases' 43. Other crorepatis are Abhay Singh, Ram Das Soren, Arjun Munda, Madhu Koda, Enos Ekka and Geeta Shree Oraon.
* Criminal charges
Several candidates in Round Two are facing serious criminal charges like rape, murder, corruption and communal disharmony. Sixty candidates, including a minister and two formers ministers, are facing serious charges.
Tamar Independent candidate Shishir Kumar Singh Munda, Congress candidate from Jugsalai constituency Dulal Bhuiyan, former minister Bandhu Tirkey are facing criminal charges. Ramlal Munda, an Independent candidate from Chakradharpur is facing rape charges.
Chaibasa Independent candidate  John Miran and Ramlal Munda (Chakradharpur) and JMM's Paulus Surin (Torpa constituency) have declared cases related to murder charges.
Former chief minister Madhu Koda (JBSP) - Majhegaon and former minister Jharkhand Party chief Enos Ekka are facigngraft charges.
* Wives of heavyweights in the fray
Former Road and Transport Minister Enos Ekka's wife Menon Ekka is contesting from Simdega. Former Chief Minsiter Madhu Koda's wife Gita Koda is trying her luck from Jagannathpur seat. Both, like their husbands, are facing charges under IPC sections.
Sukhram Oraon's wife Navmi Oraon was offered Chaibasa ticket by the BJP after he was removed as BJP candidate from Chakradharpur seat as he has been convicted in an Arms Act case.
It will be interesting to see if the image of husbands will favour their wives or the wives will bring luck into husbands' lives.

What most moms would say to Obama girls critic: Leave those kids alonePresident Barack Obama speaks as his daughters Sasha and Malia look on before pardoning “Cheese” and his alternate “Mac,” both 20-week old, 48-pound turkeys, during a ceremony at the White House on Nov. 26. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images)
Raising teenagers is hard.
I know from experience — and I haven’t had to do it under the watchful eye of the White House press corps. Or the hyper-critical eye of  Elizabeth Lauten , communications director for Rep. Stephen Fincher, a Republican from Tennessee. (Update: Lauten resigned on  Monday.)
If you haven’t heard yet — and to be honest, my attention was focused on a Thanksgiving turkey that didn’t get pardoned — Lauten blasted President Obama’s daughters, Sasha, 13, and Malia, 16, for their facial expressions, body language and outfits during the annual Thanksgiving turkey pardoning ceremony.
Then she made things worse with what sounded like a half-hearted attempt at an apology that tried to show what a good person Lauten must be since she realized “how hurtful” her words were “after many hours of prayer.”
If Lauten were a mom, particularly of teen girls, she’d have a lot more empathy, I suspect, and she’d probably agree with me that kids in the White House should be off-limits to media scrutiny. If you don’t like the president, fine. Criticize his policies, his actions, his decisions.
But don’t pick on his kids or say he’s a bad dad because his girls rolled their eyes at his jokes.
I still remember Rush Limbaugh calling Chelsea Clinton a dog on his television show. She was just 13 years old — that often-awkward age for young girls — and it’s a wonder he didn’t scar her for life with his attempts to poke fun at her. He also referred to Amy Carter as possibly “the most unattractive presidential daughter in the history of this country.”
Such comments aren’t funny. They’re just cruel.
So when I read Lauten’s comment, I found a video of the event in question, wondering what kind of disrespectful faces the girls made. Yes, they looked bored, there was a little eye-rolling (those jokes might’ve deserved it) and when Malia was asked by her dad if she wanted to pet the now-pardoned turkey, she said, “Nah.” I thought she was restrained, and she did get a big laugh from the audience.
At the 67th anniversary of the National Thanksgiving Turkey presentation on Wednesday, President Obama pardoned two Ohio turkeys that will now live at the home of a former Virginia governor. (AP)
As for their wardrobe choices earning them “a spot at a bar” — a really inappropriate analogy for underage girls — I have to defend the girls. Has Lauten seen any teenaged girls lately at her local mall?
To be honest, I don’t remember the last time I was in a bar, but I did attend the National Honor Society induction ceremony at my son’s high school last month here in Kansas. The boys wore suits, the girls wore black dresses. Some pretty short dresses. With some pretty high heels.
Short skirts are in style. And when you’re a teenaged girl, there is perhaps nothing worse on this earth than to wear something that isn’t in style.
Neither of the Obama daughters showed cleavage at the turkey pardoning. They both wore long sleeves. Yes, their skirts were short. Malia wore dark tights with hers. My son’s high school would not have sent either one home for indecent clothing.
After the firestorm of criticism erupted against Lauten, she posted an apology, but she never used the words, “I’m sorry,” and she didn’t direct her comments directly to Malia and Sasha, as she should have. How about, “I don’t agree with your father’s policies, but I’m sorry for attacking the two of you”?
Instead, she described how she prayed for hours. Did she not recall what many say is the basic message of Jesus Christ? “Love one another.”
“Love one another.” That doesn’t mean posting hateful messages against young girls on Facebook . It means showing respect, even when you disagree with others. It means practicing kindness. It means being nice and remembering that we are all human.
That message was expanded in Sunday’s sermon by Adam Hamilton, the senior pastor at the United Methodist Church of the Resurrection in Leawood, Kan. when he said, “Jesus called us to love our neighbors and to love our enemies.”
Lauten’s original post linked to an article  from a conservative site that concluded, “I don’t think you would have ever seen the Bush daughters in dresses that short. Class is completely absent from this White House.” It seems like Lauten, whose job is to put the spin on the message, should have known better than to pick up this gauntlet of hate and run with it.
Expressing such disdain for young girls hardly seems like the way for Republicans to woo women, minorities and youth.
Or the way for one Republican woman to stay employed. There’s already a Facebook page and an online petition calling for Lauten to resign — or for Fincher to fire her.
As for Sasha and Malia — I hope someone shows them this video of Chelsea Clinton, who said, “I’m a believer in a thick skin as a survival tactic….I have the indubious honor of being compared to a dog as a 13-year-old by Rush Limbaugh. That was not about me, that was about him.”

The AIFs that have registered with SEBI in November are Religare Dynamic Trust, Indus Way Emerging Market Fund and Carpediem Capital Partners Fund and those registered in October are Singular India Opportunities Trust.
The regulator had notified in May 2012, the guidelines for this new class of market intermediaries. AIFs are basically funds established or incorporated in India for the purpose of pooling in capital from Indian and foreign investors for investing as per a pre-decided policy.

The Category-III, AIFs are those trading with a view to making short-term returns and it includes hedge funds, among others.
The Category-II AIFs can invest anywhere in any combination but are prohibited from raising debt, except for meeting their day-to-day operational requirements. These AIFs include private equity funds, debt funds or fund of funds, as also all others falling outside the ambit of above two other categories.

Trading activity resumed at Bedi APMC in Rajkot after the striking labourers unconditionally called off their two-day strike at one of the largest market yards in Saurashtra.
Arrivals of groundnut, wheat, onion, cumin seeds among other crops began on Monday after nearly 1,200 labourers ended their strike.

Imran Khan threatens to "shut down" PakistanSaudi cleric's wife shows face on TV, sparking uproar
Pakistan’s opposition leader Imran Khan threatened to “shut down” the entire country by December 16 if the Nawaz Sharif Government failed to initiate an impartial probe into the alleged rigging in 2013 general elections.
The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chief, in a rally here outside the Parliament, said that his protest will continue till the government initiate an inquiry into the “massive rigging” in last year’s general elections, which saw Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) win by a landslide.
“The ball is in your court, Nawaz Sharif do your talks, do your investigations and solve the issue. We will close Pakistan down when December 16 comes, and what I do after that you will not be able to bear it…It has been 109 days and Naya Pakistan is waking up every day. We can all see it,” Khan was quoted as saying by Dawn.
“On Thursday (December 4), I will go to Lahore and shut it down. On December 8 I will shut down Faisalabad, on December 12 I will go to Karachi and shut it down. By December 16 I will shut down all of Pakistan if the poll inquiry is not initiated,” Khan said.
The cricketer-turned-politician has been holding protest-rallies in different cities to spread his movement, demanding a probe into the allegations of rigging the election.
Khan had launched his protest in mid-August, demanding Sharif’s ouster, but he later withdrew his mainÂ demand of the Prime Minister’s resignation ahead of the probe and offeredÂ the government to constitute a judicial commission comprisingÂ Supreme Court judges, ISI and Military Intelligence officials, to investigate the reported rigging.
December 16 is considered as a tragic day in the history of Pakistan as the country lost its eastern wing after a war with India when its army surrendered and Bangladesh emerged as an independent country.
The PTI leader said that if his demand for the impartial inquiry of the elections was not met, he would make the functioning of government “impossible”.
He alleged that the Nawaz Sahrif government is promoting corruption and politics of patronage.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister’s spokesman, Mussadik Malik said that it was “unfortunate” that Khan had threatened to “shut down” the country.
“What he want to achieve through it. I urge him to leave the politics of agitation and enter into a meaningful dialogue to achieve his objectives,” he said.
Minister for Railways Saad Rafiq said such announcements cannot be made by a patriotic person.
“Imran wants to spread anarchy and derail democracy in the disguise of bringing true democracy,” he said.

Trinamool Congress hits backs at Amit ShahTrinamool Congress hits backs at Amit Shah
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Dec 01, 2014 03:05 PM IST
A day after BJP chief Amit Shah targeted Trinamool Congress in Kolkata, Mamata Banerjee's party today hit back alleging that his name was mentioned in a 'red diary' purportedly seized by CBI from Sahara's office but the government dismissed the charge as speculation.
In Rajya Sabha today, Trinamool MP Derek O'Brien tried to raise the issue of the alleged 'red diary' of Sahara and party members staged a walkout when they were not allowed to speak out of turn.
Outside Parliament, Trinamool MPs staged a protest waving red placards with Sahara written on them and demanded a clarification from Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issue.
TMC leader Sudeep Bandhopadhyay told reporters that the BJP chief's name was mentioned in a 'red diary' allegedly recovered by the Central Bureau of Investigation during searches at Sahara's office in November.
"We want to know why they are being secretive about the names.... Why is CBI not revealing the names? We will not let it go. We want a discussion on the issue," he said.
"On 22nd November 2014, in a raid at CBI office, a red diary was recovered. In that red diary, I have information that national president of BJP Amit Shah's name is present along with one Mr NM. Whose names are these? CBI is not revealing this... Action has not been taken.
"I hope the government will clarify the issue," he said.
Union Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju rejected the charges, saying these were false speculations and 'political in nature'.
"These all are false speculations," the Minister said outside Parliament House.
He said that political parties have the right to conduct rallies and meetings in any part of the country, a reference to attempts to stall Shah's rally at Kolkata yesterday.
"These are all political statements. A political party has the right to conduct rallies, meetings anywhere in the country. And if somebody is making a political issue out of it, it is political in nature," he added.

Celkon launches India s cheapest Windows phoneCelkon launches India's cheapest Windows phone
BS Reporter | Hyderabad Dec 01, 2014 08:40 PM IST
Celkon Mobiles, a Hyderabad-based dual-SIM mobile handset manufacturer and wireless solutions provider, today launched Celkon Win 400, arguably India’s cheapest Windows smartphone, with a price tag of Rs 4,979.
Win 400, the first Windows phone from Celkon’s stable, runs on Windows Phone 8.1 operating system (OS). The new handset features a 4-inch high-definition display, powered by 1.2-gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 chipset and backed by a 1,500-mAh lithium ion battery. It sports a 5-mega pixel rear camera with LED flash and a 1.3-mega pixel front-facing camera.
“Our plan is to bring more smartphones on the Windows platform. The next in line will be a 5-inch Windows phone, which is currently in the testing stage,” Murali Retineni, executive director of Celkon Mobiles, told mediapersons.
According to Retineni, Celkon currently enjoys a four per cent share in the Indian smartphones market and is aiming at taking this to between seven per cent and eight per cent by March 2015.
Celkon is the third Indian original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to launch a budget handset based on Microsoft’s operating system, with the other two being Micromax and Lava International.
While Micromax launched two Windows handsets – Win W092 and Win W121 – under its Canvas series priced at Rs 6,500 and Rs 9,500 respectively earlier this year, Lava launched its first Windows phone – Xolo Win Q900s – at Rs 9,999 in June.
“This (Win 400) would be our most affordable offering. We would like to develop a larger portfolio of Windows phones in association with Celkon,” said Rajiv Ahlawat, director (mobility), Microsoft India.
Microsoft’s Windows Phone OS was maintaining a second position, behind Android, Ahlawat said.

Afghanistan: Suicide attack at funeral kills9Print
Afghan security forces inspect the site of a suicide attack in Kabul, Afghanistan, Thursday, Nov. 27, 2014. A suicide bomber attacked a British embassy vehicle in the Afghan capital Kabul on Thursday, killing several Afghan civilians and wounding more than 30 others, officials said. An embassy spokesman confirmed the attack and said some people in the vehicle were wounded, without providing further details. He added that the vehicle was not carrying any British diplomats.

An Afghan official says a suicide bomber detonated his payload at a crowded funeral, killing two police and seven civilians.
Taj Mohammed Taqwa, chief of the Burka district in the Baghlan province north of Kabul, says the attacker appeared to be targeting police and local officials, including him, who were among some 1,000 people attending Monday’s funeral.
Taliban insurgents have stepped up attacks across Afghanistan in the run-up to the official end of the U.S. and NATO combat mission on Dec. 31, raising concerns about whether local security forces will be able to protect the country as foreign troops shift to a supporting role.

Samajwadi Party red faced over eviction notice  members create ruckus in RajyaSabhaBy: Press Trust of India | New Delhi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 3:57 pm | Updated: December 1, 2014 4:03 pm
Eviction notice to Samajwadi Party member Neeraj Shekhar from an official bungalow on Monday created uproar in Rajya Sabha as party members raised the issue accusing the government of vendetta.
Soon after the start of Question Hour, (SP) raised the issue seeking Chairman Hamid Ansari’s protection over the issue, as other party members joined by Congress accused the government of doing so deliberately.
Despite assurances by the Chairman and Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi that the issue will be resolved as per rules, SP and Congress members created ruckus forcing Ansari to adjourn the House for one hour.
The Question Hour, whose timing has been changed by the Chairman from 11 AM to 12 noon, became a casualty as members refused to allow the House to function and instead wanted the issue to be resolved.
“I need your protection as one of our members, who is a two-term Lok Sabha member and has now come to the Rajya Sabha has been issued eviction notice from his official bungalow. I have been a victim of this, I need your protection…He has lived in this house since 1967,” Bachchan said.
She was supported by party colleagues, who accused the government of doing it deliberately out of “vendetta”.
Congress members too were on their feet raising similar accommodation problems.
The Chairman said housing issues cannot be discussed in the House as there was a separate Housing Committee for it.
“The matter has been taken note of. Allow the matter to be sorted out. The matter is in the know of the government,” he said.
Naqvi tried to assure the agitated SP members saying, “As per Supreme Court directives, the house in question is in the name of someone else and he is not living…I have given the information to the Minister who is looking into it and will do whatever can be done as per rules.”
This assurance, however, did not clam down the SP members. They kept shouting and were joined by Congress, forcing the Chair to adjourn the House till 1 PM.

All 4 Mumbai boys stayed in different Islamic State training camps: Sources39
0
Mumbai: As intelligence agencies grill Mumbai boy Areeb Majeed who returned after fighting for the Islamic State in Iraq, sources say that he is likely to have revealed that all the four youngsters from Kalyan including him were sent to separate training camps in Iraq.They however, kept in touch with each other.
According to sources, Majeed has claimed that he met another Indian national from the Gulf. He is cooperating with the investigating agencies in the probe. Majeed's family has also been allowed access to him.
23-year-old Areeb, who returned to India after fighting for terror outfit Islamic State, is being interrogated by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), Intelligence Bureau (IB), Research & Analysis Wing (RAW) and Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS).
#mumbai #islamic state #areeb majeed #is
During the interrogation Majeed he has also revealed that there are around 13 other youngsters from India who are fighting for the IS in Syria, said sources. Majeed who is in NIA custody till December 8 is also likely to undergo narco analysis and lie detection test, said sources.
A case has been slapped against ISIS and its operatives under Section 125 of the IPC which deals with waging war against any Asiatic country which has friendly ties with India, entailing maximum punishment of life imprisonment.
In May this year, four youths from Kalyan - Shaheen Tanki, Fahad Shaikh and Aman Tandel, besides Areeb - had left India to visit holy places in the West Asia, but they disappeared thereafter and since then were suspected to have joined the Sunni extremist group.

Weak euro becoming key to Europe s recovery... 
DAVID McHUGH | December 1, 2014 05:44 AM EST | Associated Press
FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — If that creme brulee in a Paris cafe seems a bit cheaper for U.S. tourists next summer, they may have the European Central Bank to thank for it.
Economists are lowering their forecasts for the value of the euro on expectations that the ECB will make good on its promises to provide more support to the eurozone economy if it needs it. Central bank stimulus tends to weigh on a currency.
Ultimately, the euro's drop itself could be the biggest boon to the economy as it helps exporters and encourages tourism.
ECB officials are debating whether to provide more stimulus, perhaps in the form of large-scale purchases of government bonds. Analysts think such a program — which is called quantitative easing and has been used by the U.S. Federal Reserve — will not be decided at the next governing council meeting on Thursday but could come in the first months of next year. ECB President Mario Draghi has been emphatic recently about the bank's willingness to do more.
Yet the ECB may already have achieved some of the most powerful effects of any future stimulus — as the currency is falling in anticipation of action.
Against the dollar, the shared currency was below $1.25 on Monday, from near $1.40 in early May. Experts say it could fall further, to as low as $1.10, over the next year or two.
BOOSTING GROWTH
Stefan Schneider, chief German economist at Deutsche Bank, estimated that a 10 percent depreciation in the euro's value against a group of key currencies adds as much as 0.8 percent to economic output in the 18-country eurozone.
That is putting the euro front and center, particularly as some analyst question how effective the ECB stimulus measures would be through other channels.
For instance, bond purchases are meant to drive market interest rates down, making life easier for companies, consumers and governments. Yet bond yields are already very low and it's not clear how much further the ECB can drive them down.
"The ECB doesn't want to be seen as manipulating the exchange rate, so it's an intended side effect, I would call it," said Schneider. "And given the weakness of domestic demand ...I think a little bit more tailwind from the external side, that's what the ECB is looking for.  "
Deutsche Bank thinks further ECB stimulus could send the euro as low as $1.15 by the end of 2015.
WAITING FOR JANET
A key player in the euro's exchange rate is the Federal Reserve.
The Fed and its chair, Janet Yellen, have ended their own bond purchase program and are considering when to raise interest rates, just as the ECB is looking to push them lower.
That could pull investors out of European government bonds and into dollar-denominated investments. The result would be stronger demand for dollars among investors, and a further rise in the dollar's exchange rate with the euro.
HOW LOW CAN IT GO
U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew has urged countries not to deliberately try to weaken their currencies to gain trade advantages. But in Europe's case, U.S. officials would be relieved to see an economic recovery in the region. Stagnation in Europe, a key trading partner, has been weighing on the U.S. and global economies.
"What's most important for the U.S. is getting Europe back on track, and I don't think Europe can do that with a $1.25 euro," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. "It certainly couldn't do it with a $1.40 euro."
Zandi said the euro could slide to $1.10 by the end of 2016.
A European rebound would be "a major positive for the U.S.," he said.  And that should wipe out any U.S. worries about the euro's weakness, for now.
US PROFITS
A weaker euro against the dollar wouldn't hurt U.S. exports to Europe that much. U.S. multinationals can often produce where they sell, eliminating currency effects.
What a weaker euro would do instead is shrink euro earnings when they're translated back into dollar terms for quarterly earnings purposes. Unexpected shifts can make it harder for corporate executives to reach profit targets set in dollars — meaning an explaining job to investors.
In historical terms, the euro's recent drop is not yet that large and could go further. While that will be positive for Europe, "there's very little impact on the U.S. economy," said Zandi.

Ukraine gets loan to modernize gas pipelines... 
December 1, 2014 05:25 AM EST | Associated Press
KIEV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine has secured a 150 million euro ($187 million) loan to modernize its section of the natural gas pipeline used to deliver gas from Russia to Europe.
Ukrainian Prime Minister Asreniy Yatsenyuk said Tuesday that optimization of the country's gas pipelines would lower the cost of transporting the fuel by 20 percent.
The loan is being provided to state-owned pipeline operator Ukrtransgaz by the EU's lender, the European Investment Bank.
Yatsenyuk says refurbishment of Ukraine's section of the Urengoy-Pomary-Uzhgorod pipeline will boost energy efficiency and reduce harmful emissions.
Almost 120 kilometers of pipelines will be replaced under the project, which is also to be co-funded by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
The pipeline system has the capacity to supply Europe with 142.5 billion cubic meters of gas annually.

Ex-UPS driver s pregnancy bias claim at high court... 
MARK SHERMAN | December 1, 2014 05:20 AM EST | Associated Press
WASHINGTON (AP) — Peggy Young only has to look at her younger daughter to be reminded how long she has fought United Parcel Service over its treatment of pregnant employees, and why.
Young was pregnant with Triniti, who's now 7 years old, when UPS told Young that she could not have a temporary assignment to avoid lifting heavy packages, as her doctor had ordered.
"They told me basically to go home and come back when I was no longer pregnant," Young said in an interview with The Associated Press. "I couldn't believe it."
She sued the Atlanta-based package-delivery company for discriminating against pregnant women. She lost two rounds in lower courts, but the Supreme Court will hear her case Wednesday.
The 42-year-old Young, who lives in Lorton, Virginia, said her persistence is not only for herself. "I am fighting for my two daughters and I'm fighting for women who want to start a family and provide for the family at the same time," she said.
UPS spokeswoman Kara Gerhardt Ross said the law is on the company's side. "UPS did not intentionally discriminate," Ross said.
The outcome could have wide-ranging effects.
Three-quarters of women entering the workforce today will become pregnant at least once while employed, and many will work throughout their pregnancies, employment discrimination expert Katherine Kimpel wrote in a court brief. Some will experience complications or physical effects that cause them to ask their employers for a change of duties or other modifications, Kimpel said.
Young's case hinges on the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, a law that Congress passed in 1978 specifically to include discrimination against pregnant women as a violation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Congress acted after the Supreme Court, then composed entirely of men, said workplace rules that excluded pregnant workers from disability benefits and insurance coverage did not amount to sex discrimination under the landmark civil rights law.
The question in Young's case is whether UPS violated the law through its policy of providing temporary light-duty work only to employees who had on-the-job injuries, were disabled under federal law or lost their federal driver certification. "If you were painting your house and fell off a ladder, or if you had a ski accident, that wouldn't qualify for restricted light duty. That's where pregnancy fell at that time. It was not covered in any state law except California's," Ross said.
UPS also notes in its court filings that the Postal Service, an independent agency that receives no tax dollars but is subject to congressional control, maintains an identical policy when it comes to pregnant workers. The Postal Service declined comment.
The Obama administration and 120 congressional Democrats are supporting Young. The reason for the work limitation is less important than the company's decision to distinguish between pregnant and nonpregnant workers with similar restrictions on the work they can do, Young and the administration told the court.
An unusual array of liberal, conservative, labor and women's interest groups also has lined up behind Young. The pregnancy discrimination law "protects the unborn child as well as the working mother who faces economic and other difficulties in bearing and raising the child," lawyer Carrie Severino wrote on behalf of anti-abortion organizations.
UPS employed Young as a part-time driver whose main job was to deliver overnight letters by 8:30 a.m. UPS requires people in those jobs to be able to lift packages as heavy as 70 pounds. Young said she rarely handled anything over 20 pounds and dealt almost exclusively with letters that sat on the passenger seat of her van.
In 2006, Young, then in her mid-30s, took a leave of absence to undergo in vitro fertilization in her desire to have a third child. On the third try, she became pregnant.
Young wanted to return to work, and her doctor and a midwife wrote notes saying she should not lift packages heavier than 20 pounds.
But UPS told Young she could not continue in her job and did not qualify for a temporary assignment.
Unable to work, Young also lost her medical and pension benefits, although she was covered under husband's health insurance. "The benefits were good and benefits were hard to find with part-time jobs," she said.
Young eventually returned to UPS, but left in 2009, a year after she sued. She argued that because UPS made accommodations for nonpregnant employees with work restrictions, it should have done the same for her.
But lower courts dismissed the suit, agreeing that Young did not prove UPS discriminated against her because of her pregnancy.
The justices agreed in July to review the case. Since then, there have been two notable developments.
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission updated guidance to employers to make clear that they should accommodate people in Young's situation.
UPS itself has changed its policy so that pregnant employees will be eligible for light-duty work. "UPS believed it was appropriate to update its workplace policies so that we can attract and retain the best workforce we can," Ross said.
The change does not affect Young, now a contractor for the federal Customs and Border Protection agency.
Looking back, Young said the situation was so upsetting because she felt she was able to work and considered herself pretty tough. Recalling the birth of her second child, Young said, "I was at work when I went into labor."
The case is Young v. UPS, 12-1226.

Moody s downgrades Japan credit rating...and
versions
TOKYO (AP) — Moody's downgraded the Japanese government's credit rating Monday in the wake of the Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's decision to delay an increase in sales tax.
The ratings agency said the debt rating was lowered by one notch. Its statement cited "heightened uncertainty" about the government's ability to meet its debt reduction goals and uncertainty about the timing and effectiveness of measures to boost economic growth.
Japan, the world's third-largest economy, has the heaviest debt burden among developing nations.
Japan raised its sales tax in April and planned another increase next year as part of efforts to repair government finances. But Abe decided last month to delay the second tax increase after the economy slipped into recession in the third quarter.
The downgrade lowers Japan's rating to Aa3 from A1. The outlook for the rating is "stable," meaning it's unlikely to be changed in the near to medium term.
A lower credit rating can increase borrowing costs for governments in overseas markets. Most of Japan's government debt, however, is owned by local banks and funds.

Softbank, Sumitomo seen to play a big role
Hyderabad, Dec 1:  
The Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu today said large Japanese companies and Government agencies are interested in investing in Andhra Pradesh and soon many of them are expected to follow up on his recent visit to Japan.
Addressing a press conference here today, Naidu described his five-day visit to Japan as extremely fruitful and that it was expected to yield good results in the near and long-term.
As a follow up to his invitation to some of the corporations and Japanese Government agencies, he said several delegations are expected to come calling to Andhra Pradesh and take forward the proposals to work together be it setting up units, expanding them, or working towards making investments.
Softbank, Sumitomo proposals
Referring to his meeting with Softbank, he said Softbank has expressed its intent in setting up of up to 10,000 mw of solar power projects over the next three years and plans to invest up to $10 billion (about Rs 60,000 crore). Masayoshi Son, Chairman of Softbank, has agreed to visit Andhra Pradesh within 45 days with firm plans to make investments in solar energy and other sectors, Naidu said.
To take these investment proposals forward without any glitches, the State Chief Minister said a Japan helpdesk would be formed to provide single window clearance for projects and escort officers provided to facilitate the project development without any hassles.
He said that four Memorandums of Understanding were inked with the Sumitomo Corporation, including in the areas of farm sector equipment and improving crop yields and in the power sector where Sumitomo has evinced interest to develop a 4,000 mw ultra mega power project in Srikakulam.
INDUSTRIAL POLICY
The Andhra Pradesh Government was awaiting special status for the new State. Once such the special status has been accorded, the State planned to come out with a new industrial policy packaging it with incentives to be offered as a part of the special status and State incentives.
He said the State is forced to tackle the huge deficit of Rs 15,000 crore in the budget and balance it with the growing fund requirements. Therefore, the State is taking up several measures to bridge the deficit, raise funds through various sources and raise debt.

Why should I ask M S Dhoni to resign as capt: N SrinivasanDe Gea stars in Manchester United's sixth successive win
Refusing to talk about M S Dhoni’s role in his company India Cements, BCCI’s President-in-exile N Srinivasan today made it clear that the Indian captain would not be asked to resign despite questions about conflict of interest being raised against him.
Srinivasan, who is also the ICC Chairman, declined comments on the IPL spot-fixing scandal, which is being heard in the Supreme Court right now after Justice Mudgal Committee submitted its investigative report on the matter.
“The matter is in the court. I cannot speak on this,” Srinivasan told reporters on the sidelines of an ICC function here.
The Tamil Nadu strongman was even more curt when it came to answering questions on Dhoni, who is an employee of India Cements besides being the captain of the IPL franchise Chennai Super Kings — owned by the company.
Supreme Court has made scathing comments on the issue of conflict of interest in the case of both Dhoni and Srinivasan.
“Why should I ask him to resign?” Srinivasan shot back when asked whether Dhoni would be asked to step down.
Asked what was Dhoni’s role in India Cements, Srinivasan was once again curtly said, “Why should I tell you.”
Srinivasan is under immense pressure to give up his position in the BCCI in the wake of the Mudgal Committee’s observations on his role in the scandal.
The committee, while giving a clean chit to Srinivasan personally, has observed that the BCCI chief turned a blind eye to the wrongdoings in the league.

Fadnavis issues gag order to BJP leadersSaudi cleric's wife shows face on TV, sparking uproar
In a veiled attack on senior Shiv Sena leader Ramdas Kadam, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said “only the official interlocutors in the BJP-Sena talks should comment on the parleys.”
“My request is that if only those who are official interlocutors talk (to media), then the process will move ahead,” Fadnavis told reporters.
“See, it is like this. If you ask those who come to talk with us, you will know if there is a proposal or not,” the Chief Minister said, referring to claims by some in Sena that there was no “concrete proposal” from BJP on Sena’s participation in the state government.
Fadnavis, who held meeting with Sena leaders expressed confidence that a positive outcome would emerge out of the talks.
Two days after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) formally resumed talks with Sena on the issue of joining the government, Sena leader Ramdas Kadam yesterday accused the estranged ally of “fooling” his party by purposefully dragging on power-sharing deliberations.
Kadam also alleged that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Eknath Khadse, who is the Revenue Minister, was trying hard to “topple” the Fadnavis government as he was not made the Chief Minister of the state.
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had on Friday said it would talk to Shiv Sena with an “open mind” on the issue of the latter’s participation in the Devendra Fadnavis-led government in Maharashtra.
“We are going to meet Shiv Sena leaders with an open mind. We have been allies in the past and the Sena is also part of BJP-led government at the Centre,” Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had told reporters before leaving for ‘Matoshree’, the residence of Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray, where he held talks with Sena leaders for one and a half hour.
“Shiv Sena has been our natural ally. We will hold talks with an open mind,” Pradhan had said.
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has 121 MLAs in the 288-member House. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), which has 41 MLAs, announced outside support to the state government, but some in BJP are wary of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar and are making attempts to rope in Sena, which has 63 MLAs.

Maruti to recall 3 800 Ciaz units to check fault in clutch systemMaruti to recall 3,800 Ciaz units to check fault in clutch system
Swaraj Baggonkar | Mumbai Dec 01, 2014 04:07 PM IST
Maruti Suzuki, India's largest car maker, on Monday said it would recall nearly 3,800 units of the Ciaz to check a suspected fault in the vehicle's clutch operation system.
Launched in October this year, the Ciaz, a mid-sized sedan competing with the Honda City, the segment bestseller, had received a healthy response from customers. The car beat Hyundai's Verna to claim the second spot in the segment.
The Ciaz recall, which could potentially cause inconvenience to its owners, comes two months after the car market leader announced a recall of 69,555 units of the DZire, Swift and Ritz in September, to repair a wiring harness fitment.
The company said in a filing: "Maruti Suzuki India will proactively undertake a service campaign to inspect a suspected fault and replace the relevant part of the clutch operation system of a batch of 3,796 Ciaz (manual transmission) cars. These are among those manufactured till November 7."
Only last month US auto major Ford had announced a recall of 3,072 Ford Fiestas in India to install for free a waterproof glow plug control module.
The inspection and replacement in the Ciaz cars would be done free of cost, Maruti Suzuki said.

Rupee weakens 3 paise against dollar to end at 61.87Updated: November 27, 2014 18:41 IST
Rupee weakens 3 paise against dollar to end at 61.87
PTI
foreign exchange market
In dull trade, Indian rupee today snapped its two-day rise and fell back by three paise to end at 61.87 against the Greenback on month-end dollar demand from importers.
The rupee had fallen to 61.92 levels intra-day but positive cues from local equities and sustained capital inflows helped it to cut losses, Forex dealers said.
There was caution in the foreign exchange market ahead of quarterly GDP data release tomorrow and the RBI’s monetary policy review next week, they added.
At the Interbank Forex market, the domestic currency resumed better at 61.81 a dollar from last close of 61.84.
Later, it was trapped in a narrow range of 61.80 and 61.9225 before concluding at 61.87, a fall of three paise or 0.05 per cent.
In the previous two days, it had risen by ten paise or 0.16 per cent while trading in a tight range.
The Indian benchmark S&P BSE Sensex on Thursday rose by 52.72 points, or 0.19 per cent. FPIs/FIIs bought shares worth $35.65 mln yesterday, as per Sebi data.
The dollar index was up by 0.20 per cent against its major six global rivals.
Pramit Brahmbhatt, CEO, Veracity Group said: “Not much movement was seen in the USD/INR pair. The pair is likely to trade range bound as investors are trading cautiously and are waiting for the credit policy due next month, which will help them to gauge the markets.”
The trading range for the spot USD/INR pair is expected to be within 61.50 to 62.40, he added.
In the forward market, premia dropped on fresh receipts for exporters.
The benchmark six-month premium payable in April declined to 194.5-196.5 paise from 199.5-201.5 paise.
Forward contracts maturing in October, 2015, also tumbled to 411.5-413.5 paise from 422.75-424.75 paise.
The Reserve Bank of India fixed the reference rate for dollar at 61.8650 and for the Euro at 77.3746.
The rupee softened further against the pound to 97.48 from 97.32 yesterday and remained weak to end at 77.18 per euro from 76.95.
It slipped to 52.66 per 100 Japanese yen from 52.53.

Indias GDP growth slows to 5.3 p.c. in July-September quartereconomic indicator
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth was dragged down by the poor performance of the manufacturing sector which nearly came to a grinding halt.
The economy slowed in the first full quarter of the new Government, growing at 5.3 per cent from 5.7 per cent in the previous April-June quarter. Growth had remained below 5 per cent in the previous two financial years.
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth was dragged down by the poor performance of the manufacturing sector which nearly came to a grinding halt. Factory output grew 0.1 per cent during the July-September quarter against 3.5 per cent in the previous quarter, according to the data released on Friday by the Central Statistics Office.
The pick-up in project clearances by the Government over the last six months did not show up in the GDP growth numbers. Capital formation growth — an indicator of investment activity in the country — remained low at 28.3 per cent, falling marginally from the previous quarter’s 28.6 per cent.
Growth in government consumption expenditure slipped to 11.7 per cent from 13.4 per cent in the April-June quarter. However, it remained high, thereby helping GDP growth. This was reflected in the pick-up in community and social services growth that surged from 9.1 per cent to 9.6 per cent.
This boost of high growth in Government spending may not be available for the second half of the year as the Centre has decided to slash expenditure to keep fiscal deficit within target.
Agriculture performed better than expected even in the face of lower kharif output and decreasing acreage cultivation: Farm sector growth slipping only to 3.2 per cent from 3.8 per cent.
Mining and quarrying growth slowed to 1.9 per cent from 2.1 per cent. Electricity, gas and water supply growth was down to 8.7 per cent from 10.2 per cent. Financial and real estate services growth too fell to 9.5 per cent from 10.4 per cent.
GDP growth for the first half of the year, April-September, stands at 5.5 per cent as against 4.9 per cent in the same period last year.
Going forward, while trends in bank credit, tax collections and non-oil non-gold imports remain weak, the reform momentum post the assembly polls, improving liquidity conditions and project clearances prompt us to retain our full-year growth estimate of 5.6 per cent for 2014-15, said Citi India Chief Economist Rohini Malkani in a report on the GDP data released on Friday.
Noting the steep decline in manufacturing, industry chambers made a call for reforms pro-investments policies. “The Confederation of Indian Industry [CII] notes a moderate decline in GDP growth over the previous quarter owing to a steep decline in manufacturing output …But this does not alter the fact that the economy is on the road to recovery as compared to the previous year,” said CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee.
In a statement on the GDP figures released, he recommended the Centre rollout proactive policies which would help revive investments and address the bottlenecks plaguing the agriculture and industrial sectors, a stable and predictable taxation system, faster regulatory clearances and industry-friendly land acquisition and labour laws. These, Mr. Banerjee stated, would go long way to create a positive milieu for investment and growth.
While the growth in agriculture and services sector is in line with expectations, the subdued growth in manufacturing at 0.1 per cent is a matter of concern, said FICCI President Sidharth Birla in a statement issued here. Recent FICCI surveys show that despite positive business sentiments, investors are still cautious about expansion due to subdued demand conditions and limited improvement in capacity utilization levels, he said.
“We look forward to further action on all the pending reforms including early introduction of goods and services tax, changes to the Land Acquisition Act and further reforms in labour laws. Finally, an important element of the cost structure for manufacturing is interest rates and given the current inflation situation RBI should ease the monetary policy stance as this would give a boost to investment sentiment”, Mr. Birla said.

Bhopal gas tragedy: 30 years later we revisit the site of disaster
A look at the contemporary environmental and social situation in Bhopal through the lens of award-winning Magnum photographer Raghu Rai.

Rampyari Bai is one of Bhopal’s most persistent survivors. Now aged 90, she began her struggle in the wake of the disaster. In 1984 she was living with her son and his wife near the factory. Her daughter-in-law was seven months pregnant that night, and as the gas fumes filled the air, she suddenly went into labour. She and her baby died soon afterwards. Rampyari developed cancer and suffers from breathlessness, yet continues to fight for proper compensation. She says simply that protesting keeps her alive. “I will not leave this task of chasing governments,” she says. “Till my last breath, I will keep fighting.” (Source: Amnesty International © Raghu Rai / Magnum Photos)
Shahzadi Bi and her husband stand about 100 meters from her home, at the base of a pond which Union Carbide used to dump factory waste. Union Carbide lined the pond with plastic, the edge of which is visible in this picture.   Shahzadi Bi was living with her family near the old Union Carbide factory the night of the deadly gas leak. “I was vomiting, had severe chest pain and eye irritation,” she says. Her husband fared no better - doctors told him that his heart was irreparably damaged by the leak. Their children suffer chronic chest pain. Her two other children, who were born after the 1984 disaster, have also been blighted by illness. “My daughter couldn’t conceive for four years after her marriage,” she says, adding: “Doctors had told her clearly that ‘since you have been drinking this toxic water, you will not be able to give birth.’" (Source: Amnesty International © Raghu Rai / Magnum Photos)
Shahzadi Bi, aged 60, lives in Blue Moon Colony, one of the 22 communities that surround the old Union Carbide pesticide factory. The area is ravaged by water contamination, caused by pollution caused by Union Carbide operations.   “I am a victim of both disasters – the toxic gas leak and toxicity in drinking water,” she explains. The disaster overturned her and her family’s lives. “Everyone has dreams,” she says. “I too had those. My dream was not about becoming a teacher or doctor… I wished that we would provide a good education to our children… but the gas leak shattered all these dreams.” (Source: Amnesty International © Raghu Rai / Magnum Photos)

Dr D K Satpathy, pathologist and former head of the Madhya Pradesh state Medico-Legal Institute, with foetuses of pregnant women who died immediately after the Bhopal gas leak.  Dr Satpathy was working in the forensics department of Hamidia Hospital the night of the disaster. As patients died around him, he and his colleagues struggled to find a way to treat them. In desperation, the doctor on duty that night rang up a medical official at Union Carbide. The official's response, recalls Dr Satpathy, was that the accident was “not a serious matter”; his advice was to “put a wet cloth in their mouth and they will get well.”  Up to 10,000 people died within three days of the disaster. Thirty years on, the total death toll is 22,000. (Source: Amnesty International © Raghu Rai / Magnum Photos)
Dr D K Satpathy, pathologist and former head of the Madhya Pradesh state Medico-Legal Institute, recalls the horrific condition of the bodies he had to examine at Hamidia Hospital in the immediate aftermath of the gas leak.  “I saw thousands of people lying there. Some were wailing, some were gasping, some were crying. I couldn’t understand what was happening," he says, describing the bodies he saw in the street just outside the hospital. "“No country must do hazardous business by compromising human health.” (Source: Amnesty International © Raghu Rai / Magnum Photos)
Safreen Khan (aged 20). Her mother Nafisha (aged 40) was taken away with the dead the night of the disaster, but was brought back home by her father Zabbar Khan when someone noticed she was still breathing. Safreen stands next to the statue erected in memory of the 1984 Bhopal gas leak in J P Nagar - right across the road from the abandoned Union Carbide plant.  At 20, Safreen Khan is a new generation of activist. Too young to have experienced the disaster first hand, she has instead been defined by its aftermath. She first heard about the 1984 disaster and Union Carbide, the company responsible, when she was at school.   “People have run out of patience," she says. "They still remember. They still cry and mourn for their family members who died that day. They feel that at least now, our government and the company must listen and take steps, because 30 years is too long… to get justice.” (Source: Amnesty International © Raghu Rai / Magnum Photos)
Sathyu (left) went to Bhopal as a volunteer a day after the gas leak and never left. Today, he is a founder member of the Bhopal Group for Information and Action and the Sambhavna Trust.    In these 30 years, Sathyu has been a lynchpin for gas survivors, their children, and those affected by water contamination caused by Union Carbide factory operations.   “The disaster occurred essentially because the government prioritized foreign investment over the life and health of ordinary people,” he says, adding: “The more awareness spreads on the continuing disaster in Bhopal, the more we will move towards achieving what we are still trying to achieve. Most of our hope is bestowed in public support.”  Rachna Dhingra (R) left her job with a multinational management consultancy firm in the USA for Bhopal in 2003 after realising she could do something to help the communities there. She’s remained ever since and today is a member of the Bhopal Group for Information and Action. “Corporations cannot just come, kill and pollute, and leave without any kind of responsibility,” she says.

In a first  CBI questions IPS officers over Odisha chit fund scamComments
Taking the probe into Odisha’s chit fund scam a step forward, the Central Bureau of Investigation has questioned two Indian Police Service officers about their association with a fixer of the state’s biggest chit fund company Seashore group. This is the first time since CBI began its probe in July that IPS officers came under its scanner.
Rajesh Kumar, deputy inspector general of police of north central range, was called to the CBI office in Bhubaneswar in the morning on Sunday and questioned for more than three hours, while Kendrapara superintendent of police Satish Gajbhiye turned up later in the evening and faced questions for two hours.
Interestingly, before CBI took over, Kumar was heading the investigation in the chit fund scam as chief of economic offences wing (EOW) of state crime branch. “I told CBI whatever I had to tell them. I cannot speak anything more than this,” Kumar said after coming out of CBI office.
Gajbhiye however admitted knowing Subhankar Nayak, the alleged fixer. “I first met Nayak around 2008-09 when he came to meet me posing as a journalist. But I have no link with him or any chit fund company,” he said.
CBI arrested Nayak on November 18. “The documents seized from Nayak prima facie show nexus with Seashore company for channelising funds,” a CBI spokesperson said.
During Nayak’s interrogation and from several diaries seized from him, the CBI found that he coordinated with several BJD politicians, IAS and IPS officers for transfer of money. The diaries have notings against names or official positions regarding payments made.
After checking mobile call records, bank accounts and immobile properties, the CBI has found that the officers also invested capital in several businesses through Nayak. 
CBI found it intriguing that Nayak, supposed to be a low level BJD worker, was close to several top police officials engaged in the state government probe into chit fund scam before CBI took over and intervened in the transfers and posting of officers in the Bhubaneswar commissionerate police. “During interrogation Nayak revealed more than a dozen IPS and IAS officers of the state attended his sister’s marriage function,” a source said.
Nayak’s description of the involvement of top officers of the state in chit fund scam corroborates with the statements that Prasanta Dash and Pradeep Sethy – chiefs of the state’s two biggest chit fund companies Seashore group and Artha Tatwa group – gave to CBI. 
Both Dash and Sethy said they kept the state government machinery under their grip by bribing influential people, including ministers and bureaucrats thereby triggering a scam estimated by the state investigating agencies to be Rs.4373 crore but claimed to be more than Rs.20,000 crore by activists who sought Supreme Court intervention to bring in CBI probe.
Investigation by the CBI has revealed that several politicians and top bureaucrats received huge monetary benefits including expensive gifts like cars and flats and even trips to sleazy rave parties in Mumbai frequented by Bollywood starlets to help the chit fund companies dupe thousands of crores of rupees from lakhs of innocent depositors. The chit fund money found their way to businesses like real estate, gold trading, film making and media managed by politicians’ front men.
So far the CBI has arrested more than 30 persons including BJD MLA Prabhat Tripathy on October 31 and Mayurbhanj MP Ramachandra Hansda and former MLA Subarna Naik on Novermber 4 for their alleged involvement.
The CBI has drawn up a long list of ruling party politicians and top government officials who may be called for interrogation, and if needed, arrested in the coming weeks.

Leading two-wheeler manufacturer TVS Motor Company on Monday reported 36 per cent increase in its total sales at 2,20,046 units in November 2014.
The Chennai-based company had sold 1,61,908 units in the same month last year, TVS Motor Company said in a statement.
Total two-wheeler sales also increased 36 per cent to 2,10,979 units in November 2014 as against 1,55,604 units in the same month last year.
Domestic two-wheeler sales stood at 1,79,453 units last month, up 33 per cent from 1,35,218 units in the year-ago period, it added.
Sales of scooters during the month were up 62 per cent to 62,223 units in November 2014 as against 38,331 units in the corresponding month last year.

Euro zone factory growth stalls in November:...chief economist at survey compiler Markit
(Euro zone manufacturing…)
LONDON: Euro zone manufacturing growth stalled in November and new orders fell at the fastest pace in 19 months despite heavy price cutting, painting a bleak picture for the coming months, a survey showed on Monday.
Also worryingly for policymakers at the European Central Bank , who are struggling to bolster growth and drive up dangerously low inflation, factory activity declined in the bloc's three biggest economies of Germany, France and Italy .
"The situation in euro area manufacturing is worse than previously thought... There is a risk that renewed rot is spreading across the region from the core," said Chris Williamson , chief economist at survey compiler Markit .
Markit's final November manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index was 50.1, its lowest reading since June 2013 and down from an earlier flash reading of 50.4 and from 50.6 in October.
That is barely above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction, and in a sign that there is little prospect of improvement in December a sub-index covering new orders stayed below the break-even line for a third month, coming in at a 19-month low of 48.7.
An output index, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Wednesday that is seen as good growth indicator, fell to 51.2 from October's 51.5. That was well below the flash estimate of 51.8 and was its second-lowest reading since June 2013.
The fall comes despite factories cutting their prices for a third month, and at the steepest rate since mid-2013.
Annual inflation cooled to 0.3 per cent in November, firmly in the ECB's deflation "danger zone", while unemployment held at 11.5 per cent for the third month in October.
Still, the ECB is not expected to alter its already very loose policy when it meets on Thursday and there is only an even chance it will buy government bonds, according to a Reuters poll last week.

Haryana sisters who thrashed molesters to be honoured on R-DayArmy slams door on Rohtak molesters
Sat Singh , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, December 01, 2014

The army will not go ahead with the recruitment process of three men accused of molesting two Haryana sisters on a bus after a video of the women thrashing the alleged molesters sparked widespread outrage across the country, army sources said on Monday.

Defence minister Manohar Parrikar made it clear a strong message should be sent that there was no place for such men in the army while the Haryana chief minister said the women would be honoured for their “act of bravery” on Republic Day as public support for the sisters grew on social media.
"We (the army) take such issues very seriously and we have a zero-tolerance policy. Two of the youths had cleared physical and medical tests in one of the rallies held in Haryana recently but they would not be allowed to take part in further process which is a written test," sources said.
Aarti Kuhar, 22, and her sister, Pooja, 19, were travelling in a Haryana Roadways bus on Friday on their way to Government College for Women in Rohtak district, when the three men allegedly molested them. The women protested at first and then hit back with their hands, legs and even a belt, while other passengers watched silently.
A pregnant woman, sitting next to the sisters, captured the incident on her mobile phone camera and shared it on WhatsApp. The video went viral in no time.

“Go brave girls! #girlrising and wake up bystanders! Its shameful, the only one who intervened was a pregnant woman!” tweeted Freida Pinto, star of Academy-award winning film Slumdog Millionaire.
Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar announced a cash reward of Rs. 31,000 rupees each for the sisters, saying he hoped the publicity would sensitise others to the issue. “The kind of work that has been done by these two girls is praiseworthy,” he said.
A local court sent the three men to jail on Monday while the government suspended the bus driver and conductor for failing to protect the women.
The sisters, who stay with their parents in Thanakhurd village in Sonepat district, said the three men threw pieces of paper with their phone numbers at the women who did not respond. Angry at being rebuffed, the men asked them to vacate their seats.
“They said girls were meant to sit on bus bonnets and if we did not leave the seat for them, they would throw us out,” said Pooja.
Aarti said the conversation became heated but it was not until one of the men molested her that she hit them. “A pregnant lady tried to raise her voice, but the men were unmoved and continued groping us with their hands,” she added.
The incident  has once again highlighted the issue of women’s safety after the December 2012 brutal gang-rape of a young girl in Delhi that sparked nationwide protests. Haryana has also been in the news because of its skewed sex ratio and khap panchayats that routinely issue diktats against women.

Why should I ask MS Dhoni to resign  says NSrinivasanBy: Press Trust of India | Chennai |
Posted: December 1, 2014 4:24 pm
Refusing to talk about Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s role in his company India Cements, BCCI’s President-in-exile N Srinivasan on Monday made it clear that the Indian captain would not be asked to resign despite questions about conflict of interest being raised against him.
Srinivasan, who is also the ICC Chairman, declined comments on the IPL spot-fixing scandal, which is being heard
in the Supreme Court right now after Justice Mudgal Committee submitted its investigative report on the matter.
“The matter is in the court. I cannot speak on this,” Srinivasan told reporters on the sidelines of an ICC function in Chennai.
The Tamil Nadu strongman was even more curt when it came to answering questions on Dhoni, who is an employee of India Cements besides being the captain of the IPL franchise Chennai Super Kings — owned by the company.
Supreme Court has made scathing comments on the issue of conflict of interest in the case of both Dhoni and Srinivasan.
“Why should I ask him to resign?” Srinivasan shot back when asked whether Dhoni would be asked to step down.
Asked what was Dhoni’s role in India Cements, Srinivasan once again curtly said, “Why should I tell you.”
Srinivasan is under immense pressure to give up his position in the BCCI in the wake of the Mudgal Committee’s

Top 5 stocks that could be multibaggers; have returned as much as 593% in a yearAhluwalia Contracts (India) Ltd.
(Even though most of the stocks…)
NEW DEHI: It has been a dream run for the Indian markets with the S&P BSE Sensex recording a return of over 35 per cent so far in the year 2014. The euphoria in the markets has also led to a strong rally in various small and midcap stocks which have more than doubled in the same period.
Even though most of the stocks have already rallied a lot, analysts still see further upside in names like Aries Agro, Century Plyboards, Lumax Auto, and Ahluwalia Contracts, which have already more than doubled so far in the year 2014 and will continue to remain multibagger in the near future, say analysts.
Considering the overall situation of falling crude prices and control over domestic inflation, analysts predict a strong growth in the earnings in the coming quarters, which will give a further boost to the markets. So the rally is here to stay!
Global investment bank Citigroup in its latest report has raised the December-2015 Sensex target to 33000, from 31,000 earlier, translating into an upside of 15 per cent from Friday's closing level of 28,693.99.
We have collated a list of five less-known names from different brokerage firms, which belong to either the mid or small cap sector. These stocks have the potential to remain multibagger stocks in the near future:
Aries Agro Ltd: HDFC Securities recommends 'buy' and add on declines
Aries Agro Ltd (AAL) is a leader in nutritional products for plants, and manufactures a wide range of products under 65 brands of plant nutrients crop protection chemicals. Its diversified product portfolio and wide distribution network enables it to have an upper edge over its peers. Its product mix with multiple products targeting various strata of farmer is a huge entry barrier.
The company currently stands in a very strong position to grab the opportunities in the micronutrients segment in the agriculture industry. Going ahead we feel that the company could enhance its topline and bottomline substantially because of expected growth in the demand for its products.
The experienced management, higher capacity utilization, widespread network, further scope for spreading across the nation and higher utility of its products could act as a trigger for AAL to grow in the coming years.
Century Plyboards India Ltd: Sharekhan maintains 'buy'
Century Plyboards (Century) is a leading player in the fast growing plywood and laminate segment, with an overall share of 25 per cent of the organised plywood market, which is estimated at Rs4,500-4,800 crore.
The organised plywood and laminate segment is growing at healthy double digits due to an improving demand environment and a shift towards branded products. The brokerage firm believes that it can grow ahead of the industry, at 22% CAGR, over the next three to five years.
 
Century is a high-quality consumer play with a dominant market share in a fast growing niche segment. Consequently, Sharekhan expects the stock to command a premium valuation and outperform the broader market over the long term. We initiate coverage on the stock with a Buy rating.
Lumax Auto Technologies Ltd: IndiaNivesh Securities maintains 'buy'
Lumax Auto Technologies (LATL) is a supplier of key components to the two-wheeler and the passenger car industries. Its key customers include Bajaj Auto, Piaggio, Honda Motorcycles and Scooters, Maruti Suzuki, Toyota and Tata Motors. Strong tie-ups with these OEMs will entail large business opportunities in the next few years.
In spite of weak environment for auto OEMs, LATL's revenues stayed flattish in the past couple of years. However, EBIT margin weakened due to impact of higher depreciation and interest costs related to new plants .
From here on, the research firm expects strong volume growth coupled with margin expansion in the next couple of years. With comfortable D/E of 0.2x and robust ROCE of over 17%, they find current valuations attractive.
Visaka Industries Ltd: Angel Broking maintains 'buy'
Visaka Industries (VIL) is engaged in two businesses - building products (cement asbestos products and fibre cement flat products like V-boards and V-panels) and synthetic yarn.
It has an installed capacity of 7,52,000 MT of cement asbestos products with a strong network of 6000 plus stockists / dealers across India. With consumer and business confidence improving in building products segment and sustainable performance of its synthetic yarn segment, the brokerage firm expects the company to post a strong performance going ahead.
Angel Broking expects the net profit to grow at a CAGR of 81 per cent over FY2014-16E to Rs 39 cr. At the current price, the stock is trading at a valuation of 5x FY2016E EPS, which we believe is attractive. They initiate coverage on VIL with a Buy rating.
Ahluwalia Contracts India Ltd: AnandRathi initiating with a Buy

Germany publishes video of attack on girl who died fighting molestersVideo of attack on slain student published, Germans urge for award

A newly published surveillance video Monday shows the attack on a young woman who died after defending two teenage girls from male harassment - and whose death has been mourned with candlelight vigils across Germany.

brain injury and later fell into a coma. (AP Photo)
Daily paper Bild published the video on its website calling on witnesses, including the girls, to come forward with more information about the attack on November 15 in front of a McDonald's restaurant in Offenbach, near Frankfurt in western Germany.
Student teacher Tugce Albayrak died on Friday, her 23rd birthday, after her family gave doctors permission to switch off her life support once they pronounced her brain dead.
Albayrak had been in a coma after reportedly being struck in the head in the altercation two weeks ago when she was attacked in the park of a McDonald's in Offenbach.
She received blows to her head, from either a bat or a stone. Blurred footage from CCTV cameras captured the moment when she fell backwards, hitting her head on the ground.
She suffered a traumatic brain injury and later fell into a coma.
Police say an autopsy will be performed on Monday to determine the cause of death.
Her alleged attacker, an 18-year-old identified only as Sanel M, from the Sandzak region of southwest Serbia, has admitted attacking Albayrak and is being held in police custody.
On the video footage he is shown with an accomplice, who apparently tried to hold him back as he began attacking the student who had earlier intervened after hearing the screams of two women in the McDonald's toilet who were being harassed.
On Sunday, hundreds gathered to pay their respects on Oranienplatz in Berlin's Kreuzberg district, which has a large Turkish community. Albayrak was Turkish by origin.
Billed as a "civil courage" vigil, people held up photographs of Albayrak, some with slogans and written tributes.
Outside the Offenbach hospital where she died, and where people had been holding a vigil since the attack on her on November 15, they brought flowers and lit candles.
A pianist played Albayrak's favourite songs as friends released helium-filled balloons with farewell messages attached.
A petition that has so far gathered 100,000 signatures has been sent to Germany's president, Joachim Gauck, urging him to award Albayrak the national order of merit posthumously.

In a rare show of courage, two sisters thrashed three molesters inside a bus in Haryana's Rohtak town, even as passengers chose to look the other way.
Both sisters confronted the accused and mustered enough courage to thrash them, with one of the girls even hitting the men with her belt for allegedly outraging their modesty.
The entire incident, recorded by a passenger on a mobile phone, went viral both on television and social media. It showed the two girls using their hands and a belt to thrash the molesters, who appeared to be taken by surprise.

Vijay Mallya quits Mangalore Chemicals and FertilizersboardBy: Press Trust of India | New Delhi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 4:42 pm
As UB Group continues to face growing shareholder activism, its Chairman Vijay Mallya today resigned as a director of group entity Mangalore Chemicals and Fertilizers Ltd (MCFL) without assigning any reasons.
“Dr Vijay Mallya, a Director on the Board of Directors of the Company, has resigned with immediate effect,” MCFL said in a filing to stock exchanges.
There was no reason given for the resignation, which came within days of minority shareholders of United Spirits rejecting 9 out of 12 resolutions, including those pertaining to pacts with entities connected to erstwhile promoter Mallya.
The resignation, which was followed by sharp 15 per cent spike in MCFL share price, also comes close on the heels of two unsuccessful open offers to wrest control of the company.
Mallya had joined forces with Kolkata-based industrialist Saroj Kumar Poddar to launch a counter-offer to Deepak Fertilizer and Petrochemicals’ open offer.
Deepak managed to raise its stake to around 32 per cent in MCFL while Mallya-Poddar combine holds around a 38 per cent interest.
The board of MCFL is being restructured to include two representatives of Poddar’s Adventz Group.
Shares of MCFL rose 15.3 per cent to Rs 94.05 apiece on the BSE soon after the announcement but closed a bit lower at Rs 89.85, a gain of Rs 8.25 or 10.11 per cent over Friday’s close.

LPG rate cut by Rs 113  jet fuel prices by4.1%By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 4:39 pm | Updated: December 2, 2014 9:59 am
Price of non-subsidised cooking gas (LPG) was today cut by a steep Rs 113 per cylinder and that of jet fuel (ATF) by 4.1 per cent as international oil rates slumped to multi-year lows.
A 14.2-kg cylinder of non-subsidised LPG will now cost Rs 752, down from Rs 865 previously, in Delhi, oil companies announced today.
This is the fifth straight reduction in rates of non-subsidised or market priced LPG, which the customers buy after exhausting their quota of 12 cylinders at subsidised rates, since August.
In five monthly reduction, non-domestic LPG rates have been slashed by Rs 170.5 per cylinder, bringing the price at three-year lows.
On similar lines, the price of aviation turbine fuel (ATF), or jet fuel, at Delhi was cut by Rs 2,594.93 per kilolitre, or 4.1 per cent, to Rs 59,943 per kl. This is the fifth straight monthly reduction in rates.
This reduction follows a steep 7.3 pr cent or Rs 4,987.7 per kl, cut in prices on November 1.
Since August, ATF prices have been cut by 14.5 per cent or Rs 10,218.76 per kl and rates have dipped below Rs 60,000 per kl level for the first time in three years.
Brent, the benchmark grade for more than half of the world’s oil, have dropped to USD 68.34 a barrel, the lowest level since October 2009. Prices declined 18 per cent last month and are 38 per cent lower in 2014.
In Mumbai, jet fuel will cost Rs 61,695 per kl from today as against Rs 64,414.98 per kl previously. The rates vary because of differences in local sales tax or VAT.
Jet fuel constitutes over 40 per cent of an airline’s operating costs and the price cut will ease the financial burden of cash-strapped carriers.
No immediate comment was available from airlines on the impact of the price cut on passenger fares.
The three fuel retailers — IOC, Hindustan Petroleum Corp and Bharat Petroleum Corp — revise jet fuel and non-subsidised LPG prices on the first of every month, based on the average international prices in the preceding month.
Yesterday, oil companies had cut petrol price by 91 paisa a litre and diesel by 84 paisa per litre. The seventh reduction in price since August has meant that petrol costs Rs 63.33 a litre in Delhi, Rs 10.27 per litre less than what it cost in July.
The third reduction in diesel rates in one month has led to price coming down to Rs 52.51 a litre.
Non-subsidised LPG in Delhi was priced at Rs 922.50 in July and rates have in every subsequent month been reduced.

Stop cow smuggling along Indo-Bangla border: Rajnath toBSFBy: Press Trust of India | New Delhi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 4:33 pm | Updated: December 2, 2014 3:27 pm
BSF personnel should check the smuggling of cattle, especially cows, from India-Bangladesh border and clamp it down at any cost, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said today.
“You (BSF) have to work on many frontiers. You have to strive to stop illegal infiltration from Bangladesh, deal with narcotics, fake currency notes being smuggled from this border.
“I want to tell BSF jawans and officers that you should stop the smuggling of cows (at this border) at any cost and if you are doing that already I compliment you for that,” the Home Minister said while delivering his speech during the 45th Raising Day celebrations of the force here. Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) Director General Maj GenAziz Ahmed was also among those attended the event.
Cow is revered by the Hindus and the RSS and its affiliated associations have been vocal about the illegal transport of cows and other cattle across the border for slaughtering. The 4,096km Indo-Bangla border is guarded by the Border Security Force, with BGB the counterpart on other side, and his frontier is notorious for smuggling of cattle, narcotics and fake Indian currency notes.The Home Minister also lauded the country’s largest border guarding force, which also guards the Indo-Pak border, for giving a befitting reply to Pakistan during the recent spate of ceasefire violations.
“You showed a lot of patience during these ceasefire violations despite Pakistan provoking and doing repeated violations. It is because of your hardwork that no one can cast its evil eye on India. You have a glint of patriotism onyour faces today,” he said.
The Home Minister also sounded words of caution for neighbouring countries when reporters, on the sidelines of the event, asked him about the emergence of terror groups like ISIS and similar activities on the eastern flank related to Burdwan blasts.
“A threat is threat. I think even in our neighbouring countries anywhere when these terrorist organisations raise their heads then definitely all neighbouring countries should take precautions because no one can remain untouched (by their activities),” he said after the event at a BSF camp here.
Singh added that the security mechanism of the country  has devised “plans” to stop and check such terrorist activities and these measures were also discussed during the recently held conference of the top police brass of the country in Guwahati.
He said he cannot rule out further arrests in the ISIS terror case in which one Mumbai-based youth has been arrested recently by the NIA.
Talking about the security of public rallies of BJP President Amit Shah in West Bengal, he said that it was the “responsibility of the state government to see that no
untoward incident happens” during such events.

Heavy fine for Jayalalithaa  pays Rs 2 crore for closure of ITcasesWritten by Arun Janardhanan | Chennai |
Posted: December 1, 2014 4:27 pm | Updated: December 1, 2014 6:51 pm
With the centre’s decision to facilitate the settlement of a set of tax cases against AIADMK supremo J Jayalalithaa and her confidante Sasikala, both of them have paid a sum of Rs 2 crore for all the four income-tax cases on Monday. The government has informed the metropolitan court in Chennai, which was trying the economic offenses, about the payment of fine on Monday. Final order from the department of revenue is awaited before the closure of the case.
Last week, The Indian Express reported the union Law Ministry’s opinion concluding that the “discretionary powers” vested with the concerned Chief Commissioner of the revenue department may be exercised to settle the case.
The cases were registered after Jayalalithaa, Sasikala and their company – Sasi Enterprises — had failed to file their I-T returns from 1993-94 and 1996-97.
The centre had given the opinion and facilitated the settlement by compounding of the cases after the Supreme Court had asked the department to wrap up their probe by 2014-end.
The only legal hurdle to prevent the settlement option was that a set of guidelines that prevent compounding of the cases if they are linked to any anti-national or terrorist activities or being investigated by the CBI or Enforcement Directorate.
However, the Law Ministry, ensuring a legal room for settlement, had clarified that no such clauses were applicable in the case against Jayalalithaa and her associates.

Markets gained for the third straight session on Friday with benchmark Sensex surging 255.08 points to 28,693.99 and Nifty rising 94.05 points to 8,588.25, led by banking and auto shares, as hopes of a rate cut by RBI brightened after oil prices tumbled to multi-year lows.
FII buying in bluechips and retail investors picking up midcap shares helped markets cement gains. All eyes are now on quarterly GDP data to be released later. Total investor wealth is within sniffing distance of Rs 100 lakh crore.
The BSE 30—share barometer Sensex spurted by 255.08 points, or 0.90 per cent, to close at new high of 28,693.99. It broke the previous peak of 28,499.54 recorded on November 24 .
Intra-day, it touched a new high of 28,822.37, bettering previous lifetime high of 28,541.96 also hit on November 24.

Gainers in the 30—share Sensex included Tata Steel, Tata Motors, M&M, Maruti Suzuki, Coal India, L&T, Hero MotoCorp, NTPC, Hindalco, HDFC, Wipro, ITC Ltd, Tata Power and RIL.
“Sentiments were buoyed by OPEC’s decision to sustain production levels and the subsequent sharp fall in crude prices. Markets are hoping for a rate cut in the RBI policy meeting next week,” said Dipen Shah, Head of Private Client Group Research, Kotak Securities.
Similarly, the NSE Nifty barometer topped the 8,600 mark for the first time to hit lifetime high of 8,617. It finally settled 94.05 points, or 1.11 per cent, higher at a record close of 8,588.25. Thus, it surpassed its earlier closing peak of 8,530.15 touched on November 24.
Banking was the front-runner ahead of RBI monetary policy review next week. SBI led gains by rising over 5 per cent. Other banking stocks including ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and HDFC Bank also rose.
Globally, Brent crude prices fell to trade at over four-year low of $71.21 per barrel in Asian trade. This boosted shares of OMCs, paint makers and airline companies.
Sectorally, BSE Banking index gained the most by rising 2.87 per cent, followed by Auto 1.95 per cent, Realty 1.65 per cent and Consumer Durables 1.16 per cent among others.
Mixed closing at other Asian markets and a lower opening in European markets also influenced trading sentiments here. Foreign investors bought shares worth net Rs 389.73 crore on Thursday, as per provisional data.

NEW ORLEANS — At Root, a restaurant here, scallops are served in cigar boxes and a charcuterie platter, going well beyond standard salami, includes a duck prosciutto and truffle-scented chicken liver parfait.
Phillip Lopez, the chef behind Root and its sister restaurant, Square Root, wants to bring New Orleans' historically inspired cooking in line with modern dining.
His restaurants — Root opened in 2011 and Square Root opened in the spring — differ from most of those found in the French Quarter, where the city's Cajun and Creole influence is paramount.
"I think New Orleans has always been known as a city of a thousand restaurants and only one menu," Lopez says. "I wanted to create a restaurant that had ... flavors unknown to New Orleanians' palates."
Square Root, in the city's Lower Garden District, serves only a chef's tasting menu. It offers between 12 and 15 courses, and the dishes aren't revealed ahead of time. A small group of diners sit around a bar that looks into an open kitchen so that they can see the meal being prepared.

Lopez says the devastation of Hurricane Katrina helped prime New Orleans to rebuild not only the city, but the city's attitude, paving the way for restaurants like his.
"It was a big turning event for everyone in New Orleans," he says. "We were very scared of change. I make the food of the new New Orleans. I'm not afraid to open a restaurant like this and be different."
USA TODAY visited New Orleans in partnership with National Geographic Channel, whose six-part series, Eat: The story of food, debuted Nov. 21-23. National Geographic Channel also has an interactive website at natgeoeat.com.

Crude oil's latest plunge hit the energy sector hard again Friday, but consumers are likely to see a new round of softening gasoline prices well into the holiday season.
Pump prices, already 49 cents lower than year-ago levels to a national average of $2.79 a gallon Friday - are expected to come down at least another 19 cents, to $2.60. But a handful of states, including Missouri,Oklahoma and South Carolina, could soon see sub- $2 gas, says Tom Kloza, senior analyst with the Oil Price Information Service.
The drop - which is expected to  save consumers more than $400 million a day - is coming courtesy of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the 12-country cartel that was unable to agree on production cuts at a Thursday meeting. That sent crude oil prices tumbling Friday, with benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude oil dropping over 10% to $66.15, lowest since September 2009.  Wholesale gasoline contracts for mid-December delivery sank 6.5% to $1.90.4 a gallon.
Oil's slide sank energy sector stocks, especially drillers and energy services stocks. More oil patch carnage could follow, because oil prices, hurt by the stronger dollar, lower demand and rising output by North American producers, have yet to floor.
"The heaviest selling came as the (market) closed, and that is not a good omen for next week's trading,'' Kloza says."It appears likely that much more aggressive cuts will be coming."
The aggregate fallout?  U.S. consumers will soon be paying less than $1 billion a day for motor fuel, the lowest daily bill since January 2010.
Homes and businesses that use heating oil will also see a break, with prices expected to fall below $3 a gallon, vs. 2013 winter prices of $4 to $4.25.

Jewellers Shine on Scrapping of Gold Import Rule; Titan Soars 7%
NDTV | Updated On: December 01, 2014 09:35 (IST)
Oil Slumps Near $59 for First Time Since 2009 on Oversupply
Jewellery stocks jumped sharply on Monday after the government scrapped a rule mandating traders to export 20 per cent of all gold imported into the country.
Titan, India's biggest gold company surged over 6.5 per cent, while Rajesh Exports traded with over 6 per cent gains in morning trade.
S Subramaniam, CFO of Titan told NDTV that the easing of import rule has led to a substantial reduction in gold premiums, which have come down from $10-$15 a troy ounce to $3-$4 a troy ounce.
Falling premiums is good news for consumers and is likely to boost the demand for jewellery in the country. India is the world's second-biggest consumer of gold after China.
"When premiums fall, we pass the benefit to consumers," said Mr Subramaniam. Titan's margins are also likely to rise because of falling premiums, he said.
Along with a record duty of 10 per cent, the government introduced the so-called 80:20 import rule tying imports to exports of jewellery last year to bring down inbound shipments and narrow the current account deficit that had hit a record.
Smaller companies that faced a lot of difficulty in sourcing gold because of the rule saw huge buying interest today.
TBZ jumped 15 per cent, while Gitanjali Gems shares surged as much as 20 per cent.
The broader Nifty hit a record high today and traded 13 points higher at 8,601 as of 09.30 a.m.

Rupee Falls to 9-Month Low of 62.25 Per DollarRupee Set to Breach 63/Dollar: Analysts
The rupee slumped to 62.25 per dollar in morning trade, a level last seen nine months ago on February 20. The partially convertible rupee traded at 62.09 per dollar versus Friday's close of 62.03 as of 3.03 p.m.
The rupee has fallen for five straight weeks now. It dropped nearly 0.5 per cent last week. In November, the rupee declined 1.1 per cent.
The rupee is weakening because of global factors. A broad rally in the dollar has led to weakness in nearly all currencies. The euro and the yen are also trading at multi-year lows against the dollar. The dollar topped 119 yen to its highest since July 2007. (Also read: Nifty Flat After Hitting Record High )
Expectations of a cut in interest rates on Tuesday are also weighing on sentiments, analysts say. (Read: RBI May Keep Policy Rate Unchanged on December 2 )
"Forwards market and the debt markets are discounting a rate cut next week," said Vikas Babu Chittiprolu, a senior foreign exchange dealer with state-run Andhra Bank.

Now a virtual school for internet-addicted teensBy: Press Trust of India | London |
Posted: December 1, 2014 11:20 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 11:21 am
Japan is to open the world’s first virtual school to cater to the country’s growing population of internet-addicted teens who cannot function in the real world.
The Cybernation School on the outskirts of Tokyo whose motto is ‘Your smartphone is your classroom!’ will allow dropouts to complete their secondary education from the comfort of their bedrooms.
The school, to be launched in April next year, has so far received more than 1,000 inquiries for its 300 places.
The school will allow students to create avatars to attend virtual classes, make ‘friends’ with classmates’ avatars and have homework marked by teachers’ avatars.
Classes will consist of pre-recorded lectures streamed online and pupils will collect ‘study points’ that enable them to graduate after three years, ‘The Times’ reported.
In Japan, nearly 120,000 pupils refused to attend school for psychological reasons last year. Many of these are hikikomori, or recluses who struggle to form human relationships and retreat to an anonymous virtual reality online.
According to government statistics there were 700,000 hikikomori in Japan in 2010.

Early this year, when some funds launched schemes for investing in European companies, they hoped the region's shares would do well. But things have not turned out as expected. The European economy slowed for the fourth straight month in September (it grew 0.1% compared to 0.3% in the previous two quarters).
"The core economies of the euro zone such as Germany, France, Italy and Greece, which were recovering late last year, have slowed," says Feroze Azeez, director and head, Investment Products, Anand Rathi Private Wealth. Greece, in recession for the last six years, barring the last one, is facing turmoil on political as well as economic fronts. Germany, the zone's largest economy, is also slowing. Its economy shrank 0.20% in the second quarter.
To put this in perspective, the gross domestic product, or GDP, growth in the euro area averaged 0.35% a year from 1995 to 2014, reaching a high of 1.30% in the second quarter of 1997 and a record low of -2.80% in the first quarter of 2009. There were signs of revival till a few quarters ago.
"Negative news such as default on bonds by Argentina, tensions between Russia and Ukraine and concerns over debt have also impacted markets," says Ashish Kehair, head, Private Wealth Management, ICICI Securities.
Because of these factors, in the sell-off earlier this month, EU markets were the worst hit (down 10-12%). "Further, India's current account deficit has improved significantly, strengthening the rupee and, in turn, lowering returns from international funds in rupee terms," says Manish Gunwani, senior fund manager, ICICI Prudential AMC. In the last one year, the rupee has risen 8% against the euro.
REPORT CARD
Three-month returns of Franklin India Feeder-Franklin European Growth Fund are -12.16% while Religare Invesco Pan European Equity Fund has returned a negative 9.16%.
International equity funds
But one must remember that three months is too short a period to judge a fund's performance. Investors must consider returns over three-five years. For instance, Franklin India Feeder-Franklin European Growth Fund has been around since December 2000 and has seen investors through many market cycles. It has been outperforming its benchmark by at least 200 basis points a year for the past five years.
A BACKGROUNDER
The year 2013 was not as gloomy. To start with, fears over tapering of quantitative easing, or QE, by the US Fed triggered a sell-off in emerging markets and, hence, flight of funds to developed markets. "In 2013, the euro zone appeared to be on the path of revival with peripheral regions such as Greece and Portugal recovering their cost competitiveness and leading economies like Germany reporting good export growth," says Gunwani.
According to a Franklin Templeton report, while Europe went into a recession after the 2008 financial crisis, steps taken by the European Central Bank, or ECB, and individual governments helped. Earnings growth rebounded to 7% in 2013 compared to 1.8% in 2012 and -2% in 2010 and 2011. Europe's stock markets returned 22% in 2013 while the US ones returned 30%.
However, in 2014, in spite of the ECB turning dovish, growth petered out to almost zero. This combined with high valuations to put pressure on European markets.
Also, in 2014, global markets absorbed the impact of QE tapering. Then, the Fed's stance that it will keep interest rates low for a considerable time led to re-initiation of risk-on trades. This, along with improved macroeconomic indicators, made investors confident about emerging markets.
"While US markets have continued to rally due to strong economy and sustained growth, the EU region is struggling with geo-political concerns and low inflation," says Kehair of ICICI Securities.
FUTURE WORRIES
Performance of European markets will depend upon economic recovery and growth in corporate earnings, rather than re-rating, as was the case last year. Vetri Subramaniam, chief investment officer, Religare Invesco Mutual Fund, is positive on the region. On the macroeconomic front, data are varied, indicating that the recovery may have slowed but is still on track. "Countries in the periphery continued their noteworthy improvement, with strong manufacturing growth in Spain and Italy, and better unemployment trends. The ECB measures have been welcomed by investors and are supportive of growth," he says.
Gunwani differs. He says Europe's long-term growth is unlikely to be high as it faces serious challenges related to ageing population and sovereign debt. "Having said that, the euro has fallen almost 10% against the dollar, which may help arrest the fall in growth," he says.
Currency woes
FUND RETURNS
Returns have been falling across global equity funds. When compared to the Indian markets, in the last one year (27 October 2013 to 27 October 2014), equity international funds have been the worst performing among equity funds, retuning -2.2%. The BSE Sensex rose 29% during the period. Funds focusing on China have also been flat for the last one year. After registering close to double-digit growth for more than three-and-a-half decades, China's economy, too, seems to be slowing. Its GDP expanded 1.9% QoQ in the third quarter of 2014 after a rise of 2% in the second quarter. On a year-on-year basis, the economy expanded 7.3% in the third quarter of 2014, down from 7.5% in the previous period and 12% in 2010.
DON'T HOLD BACK
Investors must not shy away from global funds as all markets go through cycles. One can definitely invest in offshore funds for diversification and gain from currency depreciation. Kehair prefers US funds over the EU ones right now due to the former's better near-term fundamentals. Gunwani is also of the opinion that the US is a good hedge for India.
Azeez concurs with this view and says that considering that growth is picking up in the US he would not recommend investors to invest in international markets at this point of time since Indian markets are attractively valued and the return potential is high.
First-time investors should consider diversified international funds that are agnostic to geography and follow a bottom-up approach to equity investing. However, the investment call is more a part of asset allocation/portfolio diversification strategy. So, exposure of up to about 10% of the equity portfolio can be taken in markets that have a low correlation with the fortunes of emerging markets like India.

JSW Steel in talks to buy Bhushan Steels Od...JSW Steel in talks to buy Bhushan Steel’s Odisha unit and Orissa Sponge

Sources suggest that Sajjan Jindal's JSW Steel is eyeing two big M&A deals, the company is in talks to buy Bhushan Steel's Odisha steel unit and is also looking at buying out promoters' stake in Bhushan invested company, Orissa Spong. Total enterprise value for the deal is being worked out at Rs 30,000 crores, a source said.
Bhushan Steel has a total debt of around Rs 35,000 crores on its books and has been asked by the lenders to sell its Odisha unit which is an integrated steel plant with a capacity of 5.6 million tonnes. Promoters of Bhushan Steel have been trying to find ways of bringing down the debt levels but may not be convinced about selling the Odisha unit.
Bhushan Group's energy arm has about 15% stake in Orissa Sponge in which Monnet Ispat holds 41% stake. Orissa Sponge had been in the middle of a takeover battle due to its iron ore and coal mine reserves, this is also the reason for JSW Steel's interest in buying the company. This deal will take the total steel making capacity of JSW Steel close to 20 million tonnes which is the largest by any domestic steel company in the Indian market.
Bhushan Steel's spokesperson denied any such development which JSW Steel's spokesperson said, "We do not comment of market speculation."

India is the world's biggest buyer of bullion and gold imports are the second biggest import item (in value terms) after crude. Rising gold imports threaten the already high current account deficit, which has been pressuring the rupee.

Maruti recalls 3 796 units of mid-sized seda...Prices | Financials | Company Info | Reports
NEW DELHI: Maruti Suzuki, India's largest carmaker, said on Monday that it would recall 3,796 units of its recently-launched sedan Ciaz to replace a faulty clutch, terming the move as a "service campaign" to minimise inconvenience to customers. Maruti Suzuki said the exercise will cover variants of Ciaz that were made till November 7 in the exercise announced on Monday.
The company will start inspecting cars for suspected faults and will possibly replace parts of the master cylinder in the clutch that it said was not functioning as per the desired parameter. Maruti Suzuki dealers have started informing owners about the service campaigns to rectify the fault.
The carmaker said that it is conducting this campaign in the interest of customers. "Service campaigns are undertaken globally by automobile companies to rectify faults that may potentially cause inconvenience to customers. It's not a recall and we are taking a proactive step in this direction," a company spokesperson said.
Maruti Suzuki had launched the Ciaz in both petrol and diesel variants, with an introductory price offer between Rs 6.99 lakh and Rs 9.8 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi) on October 6 this year. The company did not specify how many units of the Ciaz had been sold till date.

J&K: Army jawan injured in IED blast ahead of 2nd phase Assembly pollsWritten by Arun Sharma |
Posted: December 1, 2014 3:47 pm
On eve of second phase of Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir, a Junior Commissioned Officer (JCO) of the Army was injured in an IED blast near the  Line of Control (LoC) in Gambir area of Rajouri sector on Monday morning.
A defence ministry spokesman Lt Colonel Manish Mehta said that the explosion came around 10.25 am. The area was immediately cordoned and searches lanched to sanitize it. The searches were in progress till reports last came in.
Meanwhile, sources identified the injured JCO as Rajinder Kumar of 6 Rajput. He was immediately shifted to the hospital.
This has been the second IED explosion triggered by terrorists along the LoC since Saturday as they had earlier engineered a blast in Krishna Ghati sector damaging an army vehicle which was carrying ration supplies for troops in the area. However, no one was injured in that explosion.
The border Poonch district along with Udhampur and Reasi in Jammu region, besides Kupwara and Kulgam in the Valley is going to polls during the second phase of assembly elections on December 2.
Elaborate security arrangements have been made by the state police along with Central Reserve Police Force to ensure peaceful, free and fair polling. Reviewing security arrangements at a high level meeting here, the state’s Director General of Police K Rajendra Kumar said that state police was fully prepared to foil any attempt  by anti national elements to disrupt the electoral process.
Following a record over 70 per cent polling in assembly constituencies which went to polls in the Valley during first phase, there has been spurt in incidents of terrorist violence. While a group of four terrorists had sneaked into Arnia sector from across the international border killing three army men and four  civilian before getting killed by troops on Thursday, eight people were injured in grenade attack on a CRPF bunker at Lal Chowk, Srinagar, on Saturday.

TMC targets Amit Shah  alleges he is named in Sahara diaryComments
Trinamool Congress on Monday launched an offensive on the Bharatiya Janata Party in Parliament and held a rally in Kolkata to counter the saffron party president Amit Shah's criticism of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Sunday.
Facing heat over the Saradha scam, Trinamool targeted the BJP inside as well as outside Parliament by alleging that a diary of jailed Sahara group chief Subrata Roy contained the name of a senior leader of the saffron party, leading to clashes and a walkout.
Placard-wielding Trinamool MPs held a demonstration outside Parliament demanding a probe into alleged links between Shah and the Sahara money laundering case.
Trinamool sought to corner the ruling party in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha by displaying symbolic red diaries.
The Trinamool members alleged the diary was recovered from Sahara chief Subrata Roy by the Central Bureau of Investigation during searches at Sahara's office and claimed it contained the name of a BJP leader.
Attack in Parliament
In Lok Sabha, Trinamool MPs rushed to the Well shouting slogans, carrying red-coloured diaries which had "Sahara" written on it. They demanded that PM Modi should explain what action the CBI has taken after the name allegedly figured in the diary. They later staged a walkout.
Bandyopadhyay had given a notice for suspension of Question Hour to discuss the issue which was rejected by Speaker Sumitra Mahajan.
"They (Trinamool MPs) have decided not to follow the rules," she said.
Parliamentary affairs minister M Venkaiah Naidu said according to rules no member can name anyone who is not a member of the House. They also cannot display placards, he said.
To this, the Speaker said the name of the BJP leader would not go on record.
After protesting for a few minutes, the Trinamool MPs staged a walkout.
Minister of state for home affairs Kiren Rijiju, however, denied the presence of the "red diary".
"These are political allegations. There is no truth in it. No such diary was recovered," Rijiju told reporters in Delhi.
Later, BJP member Kirit Somaiya hit back, alleging that the Trinamool government in West Bengal was creating "hurdles" in the CBI investigation into the Saradha chit fund scam, in which names of "one dozen" Trinamool leaders have cropped up.
This led to protests by Trinamool members but Somaiya went on saying that 3.5 lakh small investors had been cheated in the chit fund scheme.
"The state government is not cooperating with the CBI probe," he alleged.
Amid noisy scenes, the Speaker adjourned the House for lunch, ahead of schedule.
In Rajya Sabha, Trinamool's Derek O'Brien sought to raise the issue during Zero Hour and Question Hour but was disallowed.
He had earlier given a notice for suspension of Question Hour but was not allowed.
As O'Brien rose to raise the issue during Question Hour, BJP members shouted him down by raising the issue of Saradha chit fund scam.
The members flashed symbolic red diaries with Sahara written on them, and tried to storm the well of the upper house as well to press their demand.
Trinamool members later staged a walkout as they were disallowed from raising the issue.
Counter-rally in Kolkata
Mamata Banerjee's nephew and Diamond Harbour Lok Sabha MP, Abhisekh Banerjee, said the West Bengal chief minister does not want to respond to Shah as she believes "he is not of her stature".
Mamata cancelled an appearance at the rally held by Abhishek to counter Shah's allegations levelled against her by Shah.
Speaking almost from the same spot where Shah delivered his Sunday speech, Abhisekh attacked the BJP and PM Modi saying he has done nothing for West Bengal after coming to power.
Abhisekh mocked Modi by comparing him with his aunt saying while he flies in private jets, goes abroad and changes wardrobe frequently, Mamata stays in a small house, wears handloom sarees and chappals.
Without naming Shah, he said those who come to Bengal like migratory birds, address a rally and return to Delhi will not win elections in the state.
Abhisekh also alleged Union minister of law and justice Sadanand Gowda's assets jumped from Rs. 9 crore to Rs. 20 crore in three months, and BJP must explain it.
Shah on Sunday had sounded the poll bugle to oust Trinamool from the state in the 2015 Kolkata Municipal Corporation and 2016 assembly elections and called for a Trinamool-free Bengal.
The BJP's rise in Bengal has sparked speculations about new equations in the state's political arena where the saffron brigade was only a fringe player until recently.
However, banking on Modi's poll promises on development, the party bagged an impressive 16.8% vote share in the April-May Lok Sabha elections. Even though the BJP won just two of the 42 seats, it made an impact.
Frequent clashes between BJP and Trinamool supporters have been reported in West Bengal since the polls.
The BJP chief's address came at a time when the ruling Trinamool is reeling under graft allegations in the multi-crore Saradha chit fund scam and the Burdwan blasts on October 2 that killed two alleged militants from Bangladesh.
Addressing the rally that saw a crowd of two lakh people, Shah had attacked Banerjee over the Saradha case, terrorist activities as well as lack of development in the state.
The TMC on Sunday had refused to attach much importance to Shah's rally and described it as a 'grand flop show'.
The city police, West Bengal fire department and the Kolkata Municipal Corporation had denied permission for the event at the Victoria House, where the ruling Trinamool usually organises its annual martyrs' day rally.
An intervention by the Calcutta high court saw the BJP getting the nod only at the eleventh hour.

Congress releases booklet on Narendra Modi government  calls it U-turnsarkarBy: Express News Service | New Delhi |
Posted: December 2, 2014 12:47 am | Updated: December 2, 2014 1:16 am
A day after BJP changed its stance on the Land Boundary Agreement (LBA) with Bangladesh with Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself indicating the government’s willingness to ratify it, Congress on Monday came out with a booklet counting the “U-turns” made by the NDA regime.  It said the BJP government has made 25 “U-turns” in only 180 days.
Taking on the Modi government, Congress said BJP has made volte face on a range of issues – black money, Direct Benefit Transfer, Insurance Bill, Henderson Brooks report, the CAG’s mandate, rail fare hike, diesel deregulation, Chinese incursions and relations with Pakistan. To top it all was the shifting stance on the land swap deal with Bangladesh, and also the PMO’s refusal to declassify the files on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.
“This government is nothing but a U-turn sarkar,” said AICC communication department head Ajay Maken after releasing the 30-page booklet.
Maken pointed out that BJP’s opposition to the deal was made clear by Arun Jaitley in December last year. “Jaitley is known for his legal acumen… I want to ask Jaitley whether his legal sense and legal knowledge on issues change when he is in the Opposition and in the government….. Or whether the Prime Minister has overruled him?,” he asked.
The party recalled that Rajnath Singh, now the Union Home Minister, while addressing a rally in Cuttack in January last year had advocated making public the files on Bose. “Now we would like to ask Rajnath Singh what he would like to say,” Maken said. He said while Modi repeatedly promised clean politics, he delivered a “tainted cabinet” and made a 180-degree turn on Article 370 of the Constitution which grants special status to Jammu and Kashmir.
“The Modi government is a U-turn sarkar… it is a government of imitation and industralists. Congress cannot be a silent complicit to the farce being enacted in the name of government”, he said.
Interestingly, the Congress has also described NCP’s support to the BJP government in Maharashtra as a volte face by the saffron party. “Both BJP and Modi during the campaign had called NCP a Naturally Corrupt Party. The same party is now BJP’s natural ally,” he said.
BJP hit back at Congress with Parliamentary Affairs Minister M Venkaiah Naidu rubbishing the allegations. He said Congress was now “confused” and “desperate to stay relevant”.
The minister said the BJP government has been “trying to improve the situation because the previous UPA government has destroyed every institutions during its rule”.

Video of attack on slain student published  Germans urge for awardVideo of attack on slain student published, Germans urge for award

A newly published surveillance video Monday shows the attack on a young woman who died after defending two teenage girls from male harassment - and whose death has been mourned with candlelight vigils across Germany.

brain injury and later fell into a coma. (AP Photo)
Daily paper Bild published the video on its website calling on witnesses, including the girls, to come forward with more information about the attack on November 15 in front of a McDonald's restaurant in Offenbach, near Frankfurt in western Germany.
Student teacher Tugce Albayrak died on Friday, her 23rd birthday, after her family gave doctors permission to switch off her life support once they pronounced her brain dead.
Albayrak had been in a coma after reportedly being struck in the head in the altercation two weeks ago when she was attacked in the park of a McDonald's in Offenbach.
She received blows to her head, from either a bat or a stone. Blurred footage from CCTV cameras captured the moment when she fell backwards, hitting her head on the ground.
She suffered a traumatic brain injury and later fell into a coma.
Police say an autopsy will be performed on Monday to determine the cause of death.
Her alleged attacker, an 18-year-old identified only as Sanel M, from the Sandzak region of southwest Serbia, has admitted attacking Albayrak and is being held in police custody.
On the video footage he is shown with an accomplice, who apparently tried to hold him back as he began attacking the student who had earlier intervened after hearing the screams of two women in the McDonald's toilet who were being harassed.
On Sunday, hundreds gathered to pay their respects on Oranienplatz in Berlin's Kreuzberg district, which has a large Turkish community. Albayrak was Turkish by origin.
Billed as a "civil courage" vigil, people held up photographs of Albayrak, some with slogans and written tributes.
Outside the Offenbach hospital where she died, and where people had been holding a vigil since the attack on her on November 15, they brought flowers and lit candles.
A pianist played Albayrak's favourite songs as friends released helium-filled balloons with farewell messages attached.
A petition that has so far gathered 100,000 signatures has been sent to Germany's president, Joachim Gauck, urging him to award Albayrak the national order of merit posthumously.

Why should I ask Dhoni to resign  Srinivasan asksprint
Refusing to talk about Mahendra Singh Dhoni's role in his company India Cements, BCCI's President-in-exile N Srinivasan on Monday made it clear that the Indian captain would not be asked to resign despite questions about conflict of interest being raised against him.
Srinivasan, who is also the ICC Chairman, declined comments on the IPL spot-fixing scandal, which is being heard in the Supreme Court right now after Justice Mudgal Committee submitted its investigative report on the matter.
"The matter is in the court. I cannot speak on this," Srinivasan told reporters on the sidelines of an ICC function.
The Tamil Nadu strongman was even more curt when it came to answering questions on Dhoni, who is an employee of India Cements besides being the captain of the IPL franchise Chennai Super Kings -- owned by the company.
Supreme Court has made scathing comments on the issue of conflict of interest in the case of both Dhoni and Srinivasan.
"Why should I ask him to resign?" Srinivasan shot back when asked whether Dhoni would be asked to step down.
Asked what was Dhoni's role in India Cements, Srinivasan was once again curtly said, "Why should I tell you."
Srinivasan is under immense pressure to give up his position in the BCCI in the wake of the Mudgal Committee's observations on his role in the scandal.
The committee, while giving a clean chit to Srinivasan personally, has observed that the BCCI chief turned a blind eye to the wrongdoings in the league.

Rajnath asks BSF to check cow smuggling on Bangla borderComments
BSF personnel should check the smuggling of cattle, especially cows, from India-Bangladesh border and clamp it down at any cost, home minister Rajnath Singh said on Monday.
A seasoned politician and organiser, Union home minister Rajnath Singh has one of the key responsibilities in the government - security of the country.
"You (BSF) have to work on many frontiers. You have to strive to stop illegal infiltration from Bangladesh, deal with narcotics,fake currency notes being smuggled from this border.
"I want to tell BSF jawans and officers that you should stop the smuggling of cows (at this border) at any cost and if you are doing that already I compliment you for that," the Home Minister said while delivering his speech during the 45th Raising Day celebrations of the force in New Delhi.
Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) Director General Maj Gen Aziz Ahmed was also among those attended the event. Cow is revered by the Hindus and the RSS and its affiliated associations have been vocal about the illegal transport of cows and other cattle across the border for slaughtering.
The 4,096km Indo-Bangla border is guarded by the Border Security Force, with BGB the counterpart on other side, and this frontier is notorious for smuggling of cattle, narcotics and fake Indian currency notes. The Home Minister also lauded the country's largest border guarding force, which also guards the Indo-Pak border, for giving a befitting reply to Pakistan during the recent spate of ceasefire violations. "You showed a lot of patience during these ceasefire violations despite Pakistan provoking and doing repeated violations.
It is because of your hardwork that no one can cast its evil eye on India. You have a glint of patriotism on your faces today," he said.
The home minister also sounded words of caution for neighbouring countries when reporters, on the sidelines of the event, asked him about the emergence of terror groups like ISIS and similar activities on the eastern flank related to Burdwan blasts. "A threat is threat.
I think even in our neighbouring countries anywhere when these terrorist organisations raise their heads then definitely all neighbouring countries should take precautions because no one can remain untouched (by their activities)," he said after the event at a BSF camp here. Singh added that the security mechanism of the country has devised "plans" to stop and check such terrorist activities and these measures were also discussed during the recently held conference of the top police brass of the country in Guwahati.
He said he cannot rule out further arrests in the ISIS terror case in which one Mumbai-based youth has been arrested recently by the NIA. Talking about the security of public rallies of BJP President Amit Shah in West Bengal, he said that it was the "responsibility of the state government to see that no untoward incident happens" during such events.

OnePlus One review: Oh yeah  this is a flagship killer  no doubtWritten by Nandagopal Rajan | New Delhi |
Posted: November 27, 2014 4:50 pm | Updated: November 29, 2014 10:44 am
Quick on the heels of Xiaomi, which has tasted stupendous success in India without spending a paisa on marketing or advertising, another Chinese company is trying to make a mark with a hard-to-own smartphone that calls itself the flagship killer. But is this phone really worthy of the near cult following it has in some markets. We decided to take the phone for a spin.
Picture gallery: Check out the OnePlus One before you buy at Amazon.in on Dec 2
Specs: 5.5-inch Full HD (1920x1080p, 401 PPI) LTPS IPS with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 | Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor with 2.5GHz Quad-core | 3GB RAM | 64GB internal storage, no external slot | 13MP rear camera + 5MP front camera | 4K video recording with slowmotion | 3100 mAh battery | 4G with nano and micro SIM trays in box | Cyanogen 11S OS based on Android 4.4
Price: TBA
Design: This is what I like most about this phone. I got the Black Sandstone finish version for the review. The matte finish granite like rear panel syncs well with my concept of style and sophistication while a lot of my friends found the same weird. The design is minimalist in every sense and you have just the volume rocker and power buttons on either side. But the two buttons blend so well that in the dark you will be groping to find them or even the right side of this phone. The rear panel has the camera and flash as the only relief from the granite-like finish along with the smooth OnePlus log. All very classy. This class is also visible in the charging cable and even the SIM tray pin that comes in the box, all designed with intent.
Picture gallery: Check out the OnePlus One before you buy at Amazon.in on Dec 2
Display: The 5.5-inch Full HD display uses the faster LTPS (Low Temperature PolySilicon) LCD technology which makes its easier on the eyes and the images crisper. This screen can compare with any other Full HD screen in the market though I could not find anything that makes it better.
Performance: Running the most powerful chipset from Qualcomm, the One present no hassles for you. Multi-tasking is easy and even with the toughest of tasks the phone does not heat up. Apps load real fast and you can easily move from one app to the other.
Software: The OnePlus One does not run stock Android and has instead loaded itself with Cyanogen 11S. This is a lot like stock Android, but also offering lots of tweaks and even full themes that change everything from the font to the icons. Even in the two themes that come free with the phone the customisation options run deep. But the other themes are all paid, with prices starting at a Dollar. However, the Cyanogenmod has issues. I noticed that often calls drop as soon as you have answered it. Then, some Android apps have trouble starting. Plus, some features like the call log take some getting used to. But after a while I could only agree that this is a better experience that what any other Android tweak is offering at the moment.
Picture gallery: Check out the OnePlus One before you buy at Amazon.in on Dec 2
Camera: The OnePlus One has a cool clicker which again gives you lots of options to work on the photo even before you click. On the camera screen you can change modes by just swiping down from top. The camera is also fast and there is a burst mode that lets you click up to 20 frames in one go. The results are quite good with great details, even in macro shots.
The phone, thanks to its powerful processor, also lets you shoot 4K video, which however is not default. In 4K you have make some excellent timelapse videos, but the slow motion at 60fps is not available above 1080p. And to the phone’s credit is the fact that it stayed cool even after almost 5 minutes of 4K shootings, which is an achievement in itself. This is a camera that can suffice all the needs of even very demanding users.
Storage: The review unit I had came with 64Gb storage out of which you have just above 50GB left to use. There is no external storage and this extra large internal storage is more than crucial.
Picture gallery: Check out the OnePlus One before you buy at Amazon.in on Dec 2
Connectivity: No issues on this front. The phone lets you use both nano and micro SIMs as it offers separate trays for both.
Battery: One of the best things about the phone is the battery life. I would start my day around 6.30 am with a full charge and come back home around 8 pm with about 30 per cent remaining. I could not ask for more. It can last a full weekend, when the call activity is much less, without a recharge.
Verdict: At the moment, we are not sure what the India price of the OnePlus One will be. But let me assure you that this phone can take on any flagship heads on and give a good fight. So if the price is around the Rs 25,000 that we believe could be the final price, it might be worth begging or licking a few boots to get that coveted invite that will let you buy this phone. This is without doubt a flagship killer.

JustUs Repertory’s ‘Fire and Ash’ was a seamless blend of music, dance, poetry, visual arts and theatre.
“Siva, Siva, Siva!” I chanted as the curtains went up. The ambience of the stage left no doubt in my mind that the evening would transport me to the world of Siva.
A trishulam (trident) with a coiled snake, a damaru and a tambura, two long red fabric drapes framing a lamp, digital paintings on the Siva theme and three platforms, probably signifying ‘trinetra,’ all added to the concept of the evening.
In her new production, ‘Fire and Ash,’ Gowri Ramnarayan took us on a journey that extolled the concepts and attributes with anecdotes and stories of Lord Siva.
JustUs Repertory has, over the years, developed a format, a collage of sorts that brings together music, poetry, dance, visual art and theatre in a collective framework. Gowri linked together the different arts with her narration.
With her understanding of the essence of the Indian philosophy, Gowri aims at bringing the ancient to the contemporary, and thus succeeding in transporting the Omnipotent and Omniscient to the Timelessness of Space.
Gowri’s narration not only made it easier to thread together the whole tapestry, but it livened up the show by successfully communicating the deep philosophy in simple language, which at once reminds us of the role that saints and seers played in ancient times -- introducing Bhakti through the language of the common man, as against the orthodoxy of Sanskrit, which was confined to a niche audience. In this journey, Savita Narasimhan successfully wielded the paint brush digitally, even as she rendered the ragas such as Mohanam, Hamsadhwani and Behag in her sweet voice, traversing the varied regions of India, with compositions by iconic Indian poets including Kalidasa, Appar, Akka Mahadevi, Shahji Raja, Tagore and Muthu Tandavar.
The visual dimension was provided by Anjana Anand’s dance. The highlight of the show was the song, ‘Anbe Shivam’ interspersing jatis with words like ‘Katre Shivam, Kadale Shivam’ in a musical flow using voice modulation effectively, which gained a greater visual impact with Anjana’s delineation in a graceful and lyrical mode. The contrast between the music and the dance brought forth the concept of Ardhanareeshwara — the lasya and tandava aspect powerfully.
A rare composition of Surdas, which describes Siva coming to see Krishna was a delightful composition, appealing musically and visually.
The show was staged at the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan.

ISRO rushes to clarify on GSLV Mark III launchISRO rushes to clarify on GSLV Mark III launch
M Ramesh
Tweet
Sriharikota, Nov 29:  
With less than a month to go for the launch of India's heaviest rocket, the GSLV Mark III, the Indian Space Research Organisation today rushed to clarify that the impending launch will be an experimental one, with only a dummy cryogenic engine.
The rocket launch that will take place from here sometime between December 15 and 20, is meant to test how the first two (lower) parts of the rocket behaves during its flight through the atmosphere, and the efficacy of the systems meant to enable the come-back of the chamber that will one day carry Indian astronauts.
At a press briefing held here today, ISRO officials said that the crucial cryogenic engine, critical for the objective of carrying heavy satellites, will be a dummy one. The cryo engine will not be fired; indeed it will not be capable of being fired, officials said.
The GSLV MK III rocket has been in the works for about 15 years and, as officials stressed, is not an extension of the 'regular' GSLV rocket. The MK III is an entirely new rocket and will be used in future satellites of 4 tonnes in weight to 36,000 KM above the earth.
The launch of next month will be but a small step for the rocket. It will fly to 126 km above the earth, and plunge back.
The idea is to test how the stage I and II behave during the atmospheric flight.
But on the way back, the ability of the 'crew module' to re-enter the atmosphere without getting burnt out in the heat caused by the friction while re-entry, will also be assessed.
The re-entry is crucial, to human flights. As an object approaches 80 km above the earth, or the 'sensitive atmosphere' the friction between the object and the atmosphere can heat the object to some 1600 degrees Celsius.
The crew module is designed to withstand such high temperatures and to prevent the heat from reaching inside.
By the time the rocket reaches 126 km the uses-up lower stages would have been jettisoned into the Bay if Bengal.
The upper, cryogenic stage, dummy in this rocket, gets cut off at 126 km altitude and begins to fall back along with the crew module, which is placed on the top, usually the home of a satellite.
Between 126 km and 80 km, engineers will practically steer the crew module's fall.
At 80 km, the atmosphere takes over. From then, the engineers can only check the speed of the falling object, which they do first by firing small rockets on the module in the reverse direction, and later by opening three parachutes one after the other.
Some 17 minutes after the rocket leaves the earth, the crew module will fall into the Bay of Bengal, 600 km of Port Blair in the Andamans, bringing to a close the Rs 155-crore mission.

RBI May Keep Policy Rate Unchanged on December 2You are here: Home Economy
RBI May Keep Policy Rate Unchanged on December 2
Press Trust of India | Updated On: November 30, 2014 16:16 (IST)
BofA-ML Sees 0.25% Rate Cut in February on Easing Inflation
New Delhi: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may keep policy rate unchanged in its upcoming monetary policy review on Tuesday even as the Finance Minister and industry have clamoured for the rate cut to prop the economy after GDP growth slipped to 5.3 per cent in the second quarter of current fiscal year.
At the same time, inflation has hit multi-year low making a case for the rate cut.
(Also read: RBI policy to set tone for markets, say experts )
"The fact of matter is that all the parameters are indicating that there will be further fall in inflation. Between November and January with the base effect it might go up a little bit. But by March it will be well below whatever the glide path that is indicated by the RBI," said Arundhati Bhattacharya, Chairperson of State Bank of India, the country's largest lender.
"RBI Governor has indicated that he will be data driven... may be by the end of the fiscal (cut in the interest rate by RBI)," she added.
Asked whether she expected a rate cut in the RBI bi-monthly policy on December 2, she said, "No".
A cut in interest rates allows banks to pass on the benefit to customers by lowering interest rates on existing home and auto loans.
United Bank of India executive director Deepak Narang said that the RBI would wait for some more time before effecting a rate cut to prop up growth.
"Although parameters are conducive for the rate cut but there is hardly any appetite for loan in the market. Rate reduction by 0.25 per cent is not going to generate significant demand in the market," he said.
"Therefore, I think the RBI Governor would maintain status on December 2."
The apex bank, which has been keeping rates at an elevated level citing high inflation, wants the rate of price rise to come down to 6 per cent by January 2016. Poor showing by agriculture and manufacturing sector pulled down the country's economic growth rate to 5.3 per cent in the second quarter against 5.7 per cent in the April-June quarter of this year.
Inflation based on the Wholesale Price Index cooled to a five-year low of 1.77 per cent in October driven by softening prices of fuel and food items. At the same time, retail inflation, based on the Consumer Price Index, also eased to 5.52 per cent at the end of October.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has also pitched for an interest rate cut saying it will have positive impact on home and auto loans.
In an interview to PTI last week, Mr Jaitley had expressed hope that the RBI will move in the direction of making the cost of capital reasonable to help perk up economy.
On the other hand, Yes Bank CEO and managing director Rana Kapoor said the apex bank may cut rates by 0.25 per cent.
"The RBI would indeed draw comfort from the recent pace of disinflation, and in my opinion announce a maiden cut of 25 basis point in the December 2014 policy review," he said.
Another comforting factor for the RBI is that global prices of commodities have eased significantly. The crude oil price hit four-year lows and is expected to drop further.
The repo rate, the rate at which the RBI lends to banks for short term, is at 8 per cent while the reverse repo rate is at 7 per cent. The cash reserve ratio is at 4 per cent.
However, analysts feel that the RBI would keep rate unchanged this week but may effect rate cut towards the end of current fiscal year.
"I am a believer that India's current account deficit is under control and the Finance Minister will manage and control the fiscal deficit. Therefore, at some point of time in early 2015, there may be some room for RBI to move on downward interest rates," Kotak Mahindra Bank chief Uday Kotak said.
Morgan Stanley in a report said, "We believe that RBI is likely to keep policy rates on hold on December 2. We assign a very low probability to a rate cut in that meeting."
Domestic rating agency CARE Ratings too concurred the view, saying Mr Rajan will go for a status quo on rates at next week's policy review, even though inflation is trending down.
"While a rate cut would help to assuage sentiment, the RBI may choose to defer the decision for the next review," the rating agency said in a note.
Morgan Stanley said the key thing to be watched in the policy would be the apex bank's language regarding its comfort about achieving its inflation target according to its pre-guided glide path, and in turn, the implications of timing of the first rate cut.
Meanwhile, Assocham said given the subdued economic growth, India Inc is expecting the RBI to cut the benchmark interest rate by at least 50 basis points (0.5 per cent).
Industry expectations for a rate cut are not unrealistic and based on more than expected decline in retail inflation which is currently hovering at 5.52 per cent (for October).
This is much lower than the RBI's target of eight per cent by January 2015 and six per cent by January 2016, the industry body said in a statement.
Instead of any increase in oil prices, there is a talk about it further dropping to $60 per barrel. Thus, at least on this count, there should be a great comfort level for the RBI to go and announce the rate cut, it added.

Carnatic Classical
Bombay Jayashri’s sparkling recital and K. Gayathri‘s fine rendition inaugurated Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan’s music festival.
It felt like one was watching the ‘first day first show’ of a popular star’s movie. Indeed, it was rightly so because Bombay Jayashri is a celebrated star in classical music and this was the first programme of this year’s approaching Chennai December music festival. The auditorium of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan was overflowing with Carnatic music connoisseurs. The corridors, the foyer, the entrance and even the steps near the door were full of eager listeners waiting patiently through the protracted inaugural ceremony and speeches. The organisers, realising the intensity of the crowd, installed projections at the entrance with crystal clear picture quality and fairly clear audio.
The expectations ran high since Jayashri is also the recipient of Bhavan’s award. Well, she did not disappoint her rasikas.
Her Nalinakanti varnam by Lalgudi Jayaraman and the swift ‘Anandamrita’ in Amrithavarshini by Muthuswami Dikshitar with few sequences of swaras, gave a bright start to the concert. Eschewing her penchant for a languorous style, Jayashri was full of verve this time. A colourfully painted Kalyanavasantham raga essay was neatly appended to ‘Nadaloludai’ by Tyagaraja. Here, she delved deep into the niraval with the line ‘Hariharathma Bhusurapathi’ and concluded with a luxurious weave of swaras centering on madhyamam. Mohanam took the centre stage with elaboration focused on the several lower register sancharas and the melodious upper region sojourns. ‘Nannu Palimpa’ by Tyagaraja offered adequate space for the singer to explore both the musical and emotional nuances of the composition. The swara spins carried ample creativity and dynamism.
The strong point of Jayashri was her ability to blend musical savvy with emotional excellence. Be it raga, kriti, niraval or swaras, she integrated them achieving the right balance; there were no half hearted attempts or overconfident shots.
H.N. Bhaskar set his paths on the ragas and swara sallies in close accordance with the vocalist. Both in Kalayanavasantam and Mohanam, the ultimate swara segment was offered to him to show his approach and his rendition was admirable. V.V.Ramanamurthy on the mridangam and Giridhar Udupa on the ghatam were sparkling throughout. The concluding section carried ‘Chinnanchiru Kiliye’ by Bharatiar and Madhuvanti thillana by Lalgudi Jayaraman.
Mohanam occupied the prime slot in K. Gayathri’s vocal concert. She delineated the raga in an engaging and pleasing manner targeting her sancharas mostly at the madhyama sthayi initially and later touching the upper zone with conviction and ease. Starting with lengthy phrases, she embellished them with delicate brigas and concluded with finesse. Gayathri rendered the kriti, ‘Ra Ra Rajeeva Lochana’ by Mysore Vasudevachar, at a leisurely pace with its well-knit chittaiswaram and added the swara chain to the pallavi with the customary two speeds.
The Gowri Manohari treatise, ‘Brova Samayamide’ by Karur Dakshinamurthy, the elaboration on ‘Karunakarudu Neeve’ and the swaras that followed, figured earlier. Generally, Muthuswami Dikshitar’s ‘Manasa Guruguha’ makes its occasional presence in the agenda of the vocalists. Gayathri had not only chosen this number but also presented it in a tender manner devouring the raga and bhava essence of the same. Gayathri’s approach and presentations were professional and flawless. Stronger internalisation and articulation in raga essays could make Gayathri’s expertise shine better.
Tyagaraja’s Vasanthabhairavi kriti ‘Nee Daya Rada’ and ragamalika viruttham (Valaji, Sahana and Maund) suffixed by Periaswami Thooran’s ‘Muralidhara Gopala’ were other inclusions.
M. Narmadha on the violin demonstrated her long standing experience and intelligence in raga essays and swara exchanges. B. Ganapathy Raman and Chandrasekara Sarma on mridangam and ghatam alternated between soft and strong patterns to suit the mood of the kritis.

Silicon Valley in Jesse Jackson's sights

STANFORD, Calif. — Rev. Jesse Jackson leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes.
We were sitting in a Stanford Law School classroom an hour before he would take part in a panel on closing the racial gap in Silicon Valley sponsored by USA TODAY and the Stanford University Rock Center for Corporate Governance.
Jackson was about to present his case to a group of faculty, students and community members on why high-tech companies are falling short in hiring practices and opportunity for Blacks, women and other minority groups.
This is a case he has made to various corporations many times before.
In fact, Jackson's targeting of high-tech companies is a natural extension of his lifelong fight for economic justice.
From Operation Breadbasket in the 1960s Chicago to Wall Street in 2003, Jackson has maintained a single-minded focus on economic empowerment in the Black community, pushing corporations to create opportunity for Black business owners and workers.
On this evening in early November, he graciously agreed to an interview since I am in the throes of writing his biography.

I asked Jackson about that pivotal moment in February 1966, when Dr. Martin Luther King requested he take on the leadership of Operation Breadbasket in Chicago.
Jackson was a seminary student at the time, and so did not have the demands of a church that the other, more seasoned ministers in the Chicago Freedom Movement did.
Thus, he would be able to devote himself full time to the formidable task of challenging the racist status quo in hiring practices in companies that did business in Chicago's black communities.
I questioned why he was given such authority at the age of 24, but at 24 he was already a husband and father of three. He believed he was mature enough to handle it, and so did Dr. King.
Of course, Jackson began his activism many years before that moment in 1966. Greenville, S.C., where he was born and raised, was filled with young Black ministers, mentors to Jackson, who bravely organized their community to challenge the segregation of Black people.
Rev. Jesse Jackson

As a student at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College in Greensboro, N.C., Jackson led marches to desegregate public spaces, restaurants and retail stores.
But it was in Chicago that he found his true purpose.
"You may not like him but you can't stop him," Rev. Otis Moss recalled Dr. King telling a group of older, more established staff members when Dr. King appointed Jackson as head of Operation Breadbasket in Chicago in February 1966.
One Jackson contemporary explained what was unlikable: "Jesse had a way of coming on the scene…He's a very intelligent guy [but] the way he swoops down and kinda takes over intimidated and offended a lot of people without [his] even trying… He captured a room, absorbed all the best ideas out there and made them his own."
Dr. King's decision catapulted Jackson to the top of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) inner circle.
Operation Breadbasket, begun in 1929 in Chicago, and revived in Philadelphia in the 1950s under Rev. Leon Sullivan, was a grassroots effort to boycott stores located in Black communities that refused to hire Black people.
"Don't Buy Where You Can't Work" was its slogan. It was effective enough that in 1962 Dr. King brought Rev. Sullivan to Atlanta to teach his fellow ministers Breadbasket's methods, appointing Rev. Ralph Abernathy national chair.
Jackson took Breadbasket to a whole new level in Chicago.
By the end of the first year, according to The Chicago Daily Defender, Jackson and Breadbasket generated more than $5 million in revenue for Chicago's Black community and created thousands of new jobs with such major corporations as Pepsi-Cola, Coca Cola, 7-Up, five major dairies in the Chicago area, High-Low Stores and A & P, among other food stores and businesses.
Jackson was not satisfied with stores employing Blacks at the lowest levels, he sought management positions.

When faced with the claim by corporate America that no qualified Blacks could be found, Jackson found them, according to reports in the Chicago local press.
Also, according to numerous press reports, Jackson advocated for products produced by Black-owned businesses to be placed on store shelves and Black-owned banks supported with investments by companies that profited from the Black community.
The problem: These negotiations did not take place in public so, even though they were reported in the press, rumors and misperceptions about the negotiations proliferated.
His no-nonsense advocacy on behalf of Black people also antagonized CEOs unaccustomed to being challenged directly, leading to a perception of Jackson as radical and threatening.
In fact, he was advocating inclusion in a capitalist system that he believed in.
"You can't be a capitalist without capital," he often argued, suggesting that the goal was not to tear down American capitalism but to make it accessible to Blacks, women and other minority groups who had been left out and remained stuck on the margins of the American economy.
Jackson meant to offer practical solutions to the problem of marginalization; he is no ideologue. Above all, Jackson proved that he was a pragmatist in his work with Breadbasket.
Jesse Jackson says more pressure needed on tech firms
His work was impressive enough that by August 1967, Dr. King replaced Ralph Abernathy with Jackson as Breadbasket's national chair.
During the Black Power years, numerous press reports and government documents showed Jackson continuing his pragmatic activism. He expanded Breadbasket far beyond job placement, pushing corporate America to support Black-owned banks, products, and businesses and connecting the dots to economic opportunity at the international level, especially on the continent of Africa.

Pulitzer sought for reporter behind WWII scoop
Roger Yu , USA TODAY 7 a.m. EST November 27, 2014
Journalist Ed Kennedy wears a metal helmet in this March 1944 photo made at the Anzio beachhead in Italy. Kennedy became famous as the AP war correspondent who bypassed military censors and broke the news that World War II was over.

A group of journalists has launched a campaign to convince the Pulitzer Prize administrators at Columbia University to bestow the prestigious award posthumously to Ed Kennedy, a former Associated Press reporter who reported exclusively on Germany's World War II surrender.
Kennedy defied the military's instructions to withhold the story until a public announcement was made, and was vilified by his peers and fired by his employer.
The journalist group leading the Ed Kennedy Pulitzer Project nominated Kennedy for the prize in 2013, but failed in its attempt to win the award. The Pulitzer rules don't prohibit resubmissions, and the group is asking the award administrators to reconsider its decision this year.
"The Pulitzer Prize Board's work is confidential. Special awards, if any, are announced in April along with the regular prizes," said Mike Pride, administrator of Pulitzer Prizes at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism.
The project was inspired by the 2012 publication of Kennedy's book, Ed Kennedy's War, from Louisiana State University Press. The book chronicles Kennedy's witnessing and reporting of the signing ceremony at a former schoolhouse in Reims, France, in which the Germans surrendered unconditionally to the Allies.
Kennedy, who was AP's Paris correspondent at the time, and 16 other reporters were hastily invited to the signing ceremony and were told that the story was under military embargo. Kennedy ignored the instructions and broke the story a day ahead of the competition, instantly triggering the ire of the military and competing journalists. He was soon fired by the AP.
The AP issued its apology in 2012 for firing Kennedy and called his report "perhaps the biggest scoop in its history."
"It was a terrible day for the AP. It was handled in the worst possible way," AP's then-CEO Tom Curley told the news agency.
British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and President Harry Truman had agreed to keep the news under wraps for a day to allow Russian dictator Josef Stalin to stage a second surrender ceremony in Berlin, the AP report said.
The project's leaders say Kennedy's reporting amounted to defying the military's political censorship, an effort "to bend the press to its will on matters having nothing to do with saving lives."
Curley, who co-wrote an introduction to Ed Kennedy's War, told the AP that the correspondent "did everything just right."
"Once the war is over, you can't hold back information like that," Curley said. "The world needed to know."
According to the AP's account, the journalists gathered at the ceremony were told the news would be held for only a few hours. But the embargo was extended for 36 hours. "The absurdity of attempting to bottle up news of such magnitude was too apparent," Kennedy wrote later.
"The historical record shows that his career was ruined and his reputation destroyed because he did the right thing by reporting the news that the entire world had every right to know," the Ed Kennedy Pulitzer Project wrote in its letter to Columbia University.

Fans should simply hold onto their tickets until further notice: Cricket AustraliaBy: Reuters | Sydney |
Posted: December 1, 2014 10:06 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 1:17 pm
Cricket Australia and the Indian board (BCCI) remain in discussions over the future of the first Test between the two countries that was supposed to have started on Thursday in Brisbane.
The Dec. 4-8 match at the Gabba was postponed indefinitely on Saturday, following the death last Thursday of Australia batsman Phillip Hughes.
Hughes died two days after he was struck in the head by a short-pitched delivery in a first class game at the Sydney Cricket Ground, with his death causing an outpouring of emotion, sympathy and support from inside and outside the cricketing world.
“We know that there are many people who have purchased tickets to the test match who will be wondering what happens next ,” Cricket Australia James Sutherland told the cricket.com.au website on Monday.
“Once the situation has been resolved, we will advise them as a priority. Fans should simply hold onto their tickets until further notice.”
Local media reported that a decision on the test was likely to be made later on Monday, with the India team expected to arrive in Brisbane to begin their preparations.
A two-day game against an Australian XI in Adelaide scheduled for last Friday and Saturday was cancelled following Hughes’s death.
The funeral for the left-hander, who would have turned 26 on Sunday, will be held in his hometown of Macksville in northern New South Wales on Wednesday, with the timing of that considered a major determinant in postponing the first Test.
The fate of the first Test, however, had been in the balance even before Hughes died of his horrific injury as many of the Australia team were among his closest friends and few expected them to be mentally ready for the game anyway.
TV rights make an incoming tour by the India test team by far the most lucrative in the world game so cancellation of the Brisbane match is unlikely.
There is precious little room for manoeuvre, however, with the second Test scheduled to take place in Adelaide from Dec. 12-16 with the third starting on Boxing Day (Dec. 26) in Melbourne and the fourth in Sydney running from Jan. 3-7.

More than just numbers: How a nation stands united in grief for Phillip HughesWritten by Bharat Sundaresan | Sydney |
Posted: December 1, 2014 3:47 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 3:29 pm
Twenty-six. It’s a number that has for long held a reverential place in the Australian sporting summer. One that is associated with every cricket tour made to this part of the world. One that translates into the Boxing Day Test, that ultimate showpiece of the inscrutable Australian machismo in sports. The day when a nation collectively goes, “Aussie you beewty..”
On Sunday, 26 had become the national mourning number for Australia . It was a day Phillip Hughes would have turned 26, and have in all likelihood be preparing for a Test comeback at the Gabba. But instead he is in a casket, with his funeral scheduled to be held at his hometown of Macksville, where he grew up picking bananas with his father, on Wednesday.
Australia is a vast stretch of land. It takes you four-and-a-half hours after the GPS on the airplane has told you that you’re flying over Australian soil to reach Sydney. And from the skies, you can see clouds casting wide shadows on the vast expanse. At ground level, you realise it is a nation engulfed by the darkest cloud it’s ever seen, and besieged in a pall of gloom. It’s like every household in Australia is mourning the loss of a dear one —a loving son, a doting baby brother, a beloved cricketer.
And as it tries to overcome the huge hole that Hughes has left in their lives, Australia has become obsessed with any number that it can acquaint with the many memories that the young left-hander from New South Wales has left behind. Traditionally, kids playing grade cricket across the country would be asked to retire when they reached 30. On Sunday, they walked off four runs earlier in a mark of respect to a young man who was refused the right to go past 25 in life.
26 though was only one of many numbers.
A golfing tribute 
On Sunday evening, an American fired a 63 at the Australian golf club in Sydney to win the Australian Open. And the crowd went nuts. The cheering didn’t stop even as young Jordan Speith picked up the ball he had just putted and flashed his club around. It wasn’t just his comprehensive win over the likes of Rory McIlroy that had got the fans going. It was more the score he had finished with. And for a major part of the day, the highlight of the final day’s play was the cricket bat that was placed near the 63rd hole with a golf ball placed reverentially on top. Over the weekend, all A-League matches have been stopped at the 63rd minute with the crowd roaring at the top of their voices to celebrate Hughes’ life continued…

PV Sindhu: Keeping it short  sweetWritten by Shivani Naik | Mumbai |
Posted: December 1, 2014 1:02 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 12:52 pm
Ending a rollercoaster on a high – in the most literal sense – would call for a screaming red fire engine and long ladders to rescue those stranded at the vantage. That busy, noisy scene in a nutshell is PV Sindhu’s season this year. Except, the teenaged shuttler – India’s No 2 and World No 11 currently – is that rollercoaster, the screaming red engine, the long ladder and the stranded joyrider enjoying the view from the top – all rolled into one person. Dizzy and giggly all at once. She’s gotten herself into tangles on the badminton court this whole year, and wriggled out of trouble on her own; her shriek in victories just the same as her scream in defeat’s disgust.
It’s been that kind of 2014 for Sindhu who ended her badminton assignments with her first tournament title of the year, defending her crown at the Macau Open Grand Prix on Sunday . She beat upcoming Korean Kim Hyo Min, ranked outside of the 50s, 21-12, 21-17 in 45 minutes in the final. The frenetic pace and a mid-Set 2 wobble would be the only notably exciting take-aways from the day’s play. But for once Sindhu had won a high-stakes match this year with very little fuss. Though, she did manage to infuse drama into Macau when she trailed 7-17 in the decider against Indonesian Lindaweni Fanetri in Round 2 before extricating herself out with 9 straight points before eventually going on to win the title.
The 19-year-old has played 20 three-setters this year, most upwards of the 1 hour-mark, and been in at least a dozen match-point see-saw battles. She’s lost from the cusp of victory, and bounced back from seemingly hopeless situations.
Consistency’s not her hallmark yet, which is why she can be a World Championship bronze medallist within a month of going out to Li Michelle inexplicably at the CWG.
Because of the rollercoaster ride Sindhu’s been on this whole year, the Macau win stood out as near dull.
Turning out in a screaming yellow tee and shoes to match, Sindhu stayed relentless against the tournament’s giant-killer on final’s day. It was a flurry of smashes in the high-pitched battle from the attacking Indian, coupled with judicious use of high lifts given the drift on the court. Both players were happy to push the pace in frenzied rallies, and it was the greater experience of the pair of 19-year-olds and Sindhu’s abrasive attack that drowned the challenge of the Korean who couldn’t match strokes with intent.
No turning tables
Midway through the second, Hyo Min, who had beaten PC Thulasi at the Asiad with a similar blitz, opened up a 11-7 lead, but Sindhu came back stomping to win the next 5 continued…

Taming the office know-it-allWho can keep us hack-free?
A: You’re the one caught in the middle here. You were hired to do a job, and you’re figuring out how to do it by drawing on your previous experiences, your training, feedback you’ve received from others above and below you, and your knowledge of the industry. While you are expected to incorporate all these streams of data into your job performance, it’s not within your abilities to know everything, especially about events that occurred at your firm long before you started.
It’s also not fair, or productive, for a higher-up to suppress your opinions at work just because he’s been there longer. In fact, a major reason companies hire from outside, instead of always promoting from within, is to bring in new ideas. If this manager succeeds in holding your organisation to the strictures of yesteryear, he’s likely doing you all a disservice.
“This is, first of all, a problem for your supervisor, since his or her leadership of your group is being undermined by the officious senior manager’s meddling,” said Dana Radcliffe, the Day Family Senior Lecturer of Business Ethics at the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University, in Ithaca, New York. 
Your boss needs to sit down with this manager, or the manager’s superiors, and decide who’s in charge of what. It’s not this manager’s job, presumably, to tell everyone in the office what to do. There are chains of command for a reason.
Don’t confront the manager yourself, Radcliffe advised in an email to Work Ethic: “Rather, you should have a low-key but serious chat with your supervisor, diplomatically expressing your confusion about the lines of authority.”  Frame the conversation as an attempt to understand what your supervisor expects you do to when a manager from outside of your group starts giving you orders.
It’s quite possible that the meddling manager has some valuable points to add about how the company is deviating from best practices or from procedures that were long ago established for a good reason. But he’s doing it the wrong way.
“Whatever he has to offer these other groups isn’t being channelled effectively, a fact he seems not to recognize,” Radcliffe said. So it’s up to his peers, like your boss, to help channel his feedback so that it doesn’t get in everyone’s way.
While you're waiting for your boss to address the issue with higher-ups, consider how you can present ideas so that the meddling manager doesn't shoot them down immediately. Perhaps portraying your suggestions as rooted in company history will work. You may not want to call attention to how innovative or disruptive your plans are. 
What if the problem is that your know-it all manager is strong-arming people into making the wrong decisions, based on his own faulty understanding of what was done before or what the competitive situation is today? Then you have a bigger problem, Radcliffe says: "Not only is he encroaching on other managers’ ‘territory,’ but his ill-informed ‘guidance’ may be interfering with the other groups’ operations." That makes it even more crucial that your boss get involved.
If your boss isn't up to the task of getting this manager to simmer down, you may be stuck tiptoeing around for a while — or even approaching a higher-level executive who can fix the situation by neutralizing the meddler.

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala Buys Stake in SpiceJet; Shares up 17%
NDTV | Updated On: December 01, 2014 10:42 (IST)
Oil Slumps Near $59 for First Time Since 2009 on Oversupply
SpiceJet surged as much as 17 per cent on Monday on news that billionaire investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala's Rare Enterprise had bought 75 lakh shares or 1.4 per cent stake in the budget carrier on Friday. The entire share purchase is valued at over Rs 13 crore.
Including Monday's gains, SpiceJet shares are up over 30 per cent in the last one week as compared to a 1 per cent gain in the broader Nifty.
The share purchase comes days after SpiceJet said a few parties were interested in making investments in the carrier. India's number three carrier by market share is in urgent need for fresh funds to stay afloat, analysts say.
SpiceJet has been reporting losses for five consecutive quarters now, but it has managed to cut down losses in the latest quarter. Its passenger load factor, which measures the capacity utilization in percentage, has gone up. SpiceJet has also managed to cut down its expenses.
The share purchase comes amid media reports that SpiceJet is likely to delay paying November salaries to its employees by 1-3 days.
Aviation stocks have seen buying interest recently because of the sharp fall in crude prices, which hit a five-year low on Monday. Aviation turbine fuel accounts for nearly 40 per cent of operational cost of airlines.
Jet Airways shares jumped over 9 per cent today.
As of 10.37 a.m., SpiceJet was up 15 per cent at Rs 20.90, while Jet Airways traded 9.4 per cent higher at Rs 352.35. The broader Sensex was up 0.2 per cent at 28,746.

Nov factory growth fastest in nearly 2 yrs  inflation revivesTata Steel close to reopening its top iron ore mine
India’s manufacturing sector output accelerated in November at the quickest pace in nearly two years, driven by robust output and new orders, an HSBC survey said today.
The headline HSBC India Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) — a composite gauge designed to give a single-figure snapshot of manufacturing business conditions — stood at 53.3 in November significantly higher from 51.6 in October.
The manufacturing sector output, improved for the 13th month in a row and reached a 21-month peak in November.
A figure above 50 indicates the sector is expanding, while a figure below that level means contraction.
“Manufacturing activity accelerated further in November led by higher output and new orders. Domestic orders saw the biggest increase, even as new export orders continued to be strong,” HSBC Co-Head of Asian Economic Research Frederic Neumann said.
November data indicated stronger-than-expected demand, as new order growth accelerated to the quickest in 21 months. Similarly, foreign orders received by Indian goods producers continued to rise strongly in November.
In spite of accelerated expansions in output and new business, employment in the manufacturing sector remained broadly unchanged in November, the report said.
“The sharp rise in input prices was surprising, but future prints may be lower as falling commodity prices eventually lead to softer intermediate good prices. Meanwhile, the pick-up in output prices could partly be signalling some revival in pricing power among businesses,” Neumann said.
A cautionary note was, however, provided by the HSBC survey regarding input costs and output charges, as inflationary pressures intensified during the month following three consecutive months of easing.
“Higher output and an uptick in final prices should convince the RBI to stay on hold in the upcoming meeting,” Neumann said.
The RBI, which has maintained the interest at elevated level for the past 10 months, is scheduled to announce it policy review tomorrow.
According to official figure, wholesale inflation came down to a five-year low at 1.77 per cent in October while retail inflation hit a record low of 5.52 per cent in the same month.
Meanwhile, the country’s economic growth fell to 5.3 per cent in the second quarter from 5.7 per cent rate in the first three-month period ended June, raising the clamour for rate cut by the RBI tomorrow.
India’s Mfg sector output at nearly 2-year peak in Nov: HSBC
(Reuters) Indian factory activity expanded at its fastest pace in nearly two years in November as burgeoning order books led manufacturers to accelerate output, a business survey showed on Monday.
The HSBC Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), compiled by Markit, rose to 53.3 in November from 51.6 in October, its highest since February 2013, and the thirteenth consecutive month of expansion in activity.
A Reuters poll had expected manufacturing activity to lose some steam and predicted the index would fall to 51.2.
New orders were supported by strong domestic demand for consumer goods while foreign orders remained robust. The sub-index soared to a 21-month high of 56.2 from October’s 53.0.
The expansion in output encouraged manufacturers to add more jobs.
The survey also showed companies passed on additional input costs to consumers at a faster pace, which could revive inflationary pressures after several months of slowing.
“The pick-up in output prices could partly be signaling some revival in pricing power among businesses,” said Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC.
Economic growth slowed to 5.3 percent in the three months to September, from 5.7 percent in the previous quarter, but the Reserve Bank of India is expected to stand pat on interest rates when it meets on Tuesday despite pressure from the government to lower borrowing costs.
The RBI’s key lending rate is expected to remain unchanged at 8.0 percent until at least April.

Rupee plunges to fresh 9-month low in early tradeForex update: Rupee recovers from over 9-month low, ends at 62.02 against US dollar

The rupee on Monday recovered from initial losses and edged marginally higher at 62.02 against the Greenback, snapping a two-day losing trend, on late dollar selling by exporters and some banks.
After opening weak, the rupee hit a fresh nine-month low of 62.25 against US currency as traders reacted to government easing curbs on gold imports and economic growth for second quarter coming at a tepid 5.3 per cent. However, the local unit erased the losses and closed marginally higher by one paisa.
At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market, the rupee commenced sharply lower at an intra-day low of 62.25 a dollar from Friday's close of 62.03 .
The mood was a bit cautious ahead of Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) monetary policy review .
"Over this week, we expect the pair to trade within a range of 61.60/80 and 62.30/40 levels on spot. RBI monetary policy and US November jobs report will be key data points," said Anindya Banerjee, Currency Analyst, Kotak Securities.
Later, the rupee rebounded on dollar selling by some banks and exporters and ended at an intra-day high of 62.02 against the American unit, up 0.02 per cent.
In the previous two sessions, the rupee had lost 19 paise.
The domestic currency had little help from the domestic stock market on Monday as the benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) index Sensex closed 134.37 points (or 0.47 per cent) lower.
There was support for the rupee from data released by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) that showed FPIs/FIIs infused US $396.24 million in the domestic market on Friday.
The dollar index, a gauge of six major global rivals, was down by 0.15 per cent. Oil prices fell to a five-year low and even gold rates fell as global investors were risk-averse.
Pramit Brahmbhatt, CEO, Veracity Group said, the trading range for the spot rupee is expected to be within 61.60 to 62.40.
In the forward market, premia closed steady to weak on stray receipts from exporters.
The benchmark six-month premium payable in May ended at its last Friday's closing level of 224-226 paise while forward contracts maturing in November, 2015, softened to 433.5-435.5 paise from 435-437 paise.
The RBI fixed the reference rate for dollar at 62.1377 and for the Euro at 77.3677.
The rupee fell back against the pound to 97.48 from Friday's close of 97.34 while it moved down further to 77.31 per euro from 77.29.
The domestic unit, however, improved further to 52.36 per 100 Japanese yen from 52.48 last Friday.

Will Try to Introduce GST Bill in Current Parliament Session: JaitleyCourt Refuses to Let Off Hindalco in Coal Block Case
New Delhi: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Monday expressed hope that the much-awaited GST Bill, which provides for a uniform indirect tax structure, would be introduced in the current winter session of Parliament.
"We will try and introduce GST (Goods and Services Tax) Bill in this session...GST Bill would be taken up by the Cabinet after Empowered Committee (of state finance Minister) meeting on December 12," he said here.
The government has proposed to implement GST from April 1, 2016, and the new Finance Commission may be set up ahead of its schedule to look into the issues related to the new indirect tax regime.
The GST will subsume indirect taxes like excise duty and service tax at the central level and VAT on the states front, besides local levies.
There are differences between the Centre and states on some issues with regard to the implementation of GST that includes the revenue neutral rate and keeping petroleum, liquor out of the ambit.
While a sub-committee on GST has suggested that the revenue neutral rate of GST be pegged at about 27 per cent, the states are yet to decide on it.
It had suggested states GST at 13.91 per cent and Central GST at 12.77 per cent.
Besides, states have been demanding that petroleum, alcohol and tobacco should be kept out of the purview of GST.
The GST Constitutional Amendment Bill, which was introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2011, had lapsed and the NDA government will be required to come up with a fresh bill.
The GST rollout has missed several deadlines because of lack of consensus among states over certain crucial issues on the new tax regime.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Monday expressed hope that the much-awaited GST (Goods and Services Tax) Bill, which provides for a uniform indirect tax structure, would be introduced in the ongoing Winter Session of Parliament.
"We will try and introduce GST Bill in this session. GST Bill would be taken up by the Cabinet after (the) Empowered Committee (of state finance Minister) meeting on December 12," Jaitley said in the national capital on Monday.
The government has proposed to implement GST from April 1, 2016, and the new Finance Commission may be set up ahead of its schedule to look into the issues related to the new indirect tax regime.
The GST Constitutional Amendment Bill, which was introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2011, had lapsed and the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government will be required to come up with a fresh Bill.
The GST will incorporate indirect taxes like excise duty and service tax on the central front and VAT on the States level, besides local levies. There are differences between the Centre and States on some issues with regard to the implementation of GST that includes the revenue neutral rate and keeping petroleum, liquor out of the ambit.

Besides, States have been demanding that petroleum, alcohol and tobacco should be kept out of the purview of GST.
The GST rollout has missed several deadlines due to lack of consensus among States over certain crucial issues on the new tax regime.
Talking about the M&As, Jaitley said that mergers and acquisitions need to be encouraged to promote larger domestic companies but the country's fair trade watchdog Competition Commission of India (CCI) also needs to understand the limits while implementing competition law, Finance and Corporate Affairs Minister Arun Jaitley said on Monday.
"When our own corporates are of moderate size, mergers, acquisitions and consolidation need to be encouraged to promote size. So when it is that we draw the red line?" Jaitley asked at the inaugural of the International Competition Network merger workshop organised here by the CCI .
The CCI is becoming "extremely mature" in this regard, Jaitley said, adding there was a need to apply the "principle of proportionality" while implementing competition law.
"What are the kind of consequences and penalties that we impose in the larger implementation of the law?"
Jaitley said the question of jurisdiction was emerging in common turf issues on account of multiple regulators.
"If two telecom majors are to amalgamate, will there be common turf areas between the telecom regulator and market regulator CCI?
Therefore, how do you build the jurisdiction of the two? Obviously jurisdiction in this area is emerging," he said.

Adelaide likely to host series opener in the aftermath of Phillip Hughes tragedyBy: Press Trust of India | Adelaide |
Posted: December 1, 2014 11:09 am | Updated: December 1, 2014 7:01 pm
The first cricket test between Australia and India will now take place in Adelaide as part of a major reshuffling of the series following the death last week of Australian batsman Phillip Hughes.
The first test was supposed to start in Brisbane on Thursday but has been delayed until next week and switched to Adelaide to give grief-stricken players more time to recover with Hughes’ funeral taking place on Wednesday.
“Nobody should underestimate just what these players are going through right now,” Cricket Australia (CA) chief executive James Sutherland said in a statement on Monday.
“These are difficult days and we need to support them in dealing with their grief.
“It’s very clear that playing a Test right now is just too soon and we are reacting accordingly.”
The Australian and Indian cricket boards met with the players’ union (ACA) and other key stakeholders, including broadcasters and commercial partners, before agreeing on a new schedule for the lucrative Border-Gavaskar series.
The dates for three of the four tests were changed and the entire series squeezed into 33 days, despite fears of player burnout before the World Cup, which will be held in Australia and New Zealand early next year.
“Based on our discussions with the players and with support of health experts, we believed the first test in Brisbane was still too early for them to return to the field, and that the Adelaide test presents more time for them to grieve and mentally prepare,” ACA chief executive Alistair Nicholson said.
Adelaide Oval, which was due to host the second test from Dec. 12-16, will now host the series opener from Dec. 9-13, in what is sure to be a highly emotional occasion.
Brisbane will now host the second test from Dec. 17-21 while the third test will proceed as planned from Dec. 26-30 in Melbourne.
The fourth and final test will still take place in Sydney in the New Year, but will start on Jan. 6, three days later than originally scheduled.
Some changes were expected after CA postponed the start of the first test and the Indian team, currently in Adelaide, cancelled their flight to Brisbane on Monday.
Hughes died in a Sydney hospital last Thursday, two days after he was struck in the head by a short-pitched delivery during a domestic first-class match.
His death has triggered an outpouring of emotion, sympathy and support from inside and outside the cricketing world.
The funeral for the left-hander, who would have turned 26 on Sunday, will be held in his hometown of Macksville in northern New South Wales.
Hughes was a popular member of the Australian cricket community and several members of the Australian team were playing in the match when he was struck by the ball.

US air base lifts lockdown at high school facility in South KoreaBy: Agence-France Presse | Seoul |
Posted: December 1, 2014 12:59 pm | Updated: December 1, 2014 1:05 pm
A major US air force base in South Korea went into full lockdown for more than an hour on Monday after what appeared to be a false alarm about a shooter at the facility’s high school.
“The security forces sweeps are now complete. There were no reported injuries or suspicious activity found,” the 51st Fighter Wing stationed at Osan Air Base said in a post on its official Facebook page.
“Everyone is safe. The lockdown has been lifted,” it added.
Osan Air Base, some 65 miles south of Seoul, is one of a number of facilities housing the 28,500 US military personnel permanently based in South Korea.
The facility went into lockdown shortly after 11:00 am (0200 GMT) as a precautionary measure following what high school principal Morgan Nugent suggested was a possible hoax call.
“One of our teachers received a call that sounded automated saying that there was an active shooter drill taking place,” Nugent said.
“There was no scheduled school shooter drill on base, so we have decided to err on the side of safety and went into a full school lockdown,” he added.
The safety measure was extended to the entire base as security forces swept the high school, middle school and elementary school buildings and grounds.

Mark Webber survives grave crash in BrazilBy: Agence-France Presse | Sao Paulo |
Posted: December 1, 2014 1:56 pm | Updated: December 1, 2014 3:15 pm
Veteran Australian motor racing driver Mark Webber was injured in a high-speed crash at the Six Hours of Sao Paulo event.
Webber, racing for Porsche in the World Endurance Championship after quitting Formula One last season, was stretchered off the Interlagos circuit on Monday after his car collided with the Ferrari of Matteo Cressoni.
Footage showed both cars crashing into a concrete barrier at speeds estimated at around 300km/h with Webber’s vehicle catching fire before it came to a stop with the car wrecked.
“Cressoni was checked by the medical staff at the side of the track and cleared, while Mark Webber, who was awake and alert, was taken to the circuit medical centre for further examination,” said a statement from the organisers.
Webber, 38, gave a thumbs-up to the crowd as he was taken to the medical centre although there was no immediate word of his condition.
Porsche team boss Fritz Enzinger later said Webber was recovering in a Sao Paulo hospital.
“Mark is OK, but he has had to go to hospital for further checks,” Enzinger told http://www.autosport.com .
“We have spoken to him and said that people can go and see him, so Timo (Bernhard) and Brendon (Hartley, Webber’s team-mates) have gone to the hospital.”
The race, which ended behind the safety car, was won by the Porsche of Neel Jani.
Webber’s accident brought sympathy from former rivals.
“Glad to see @AussieGrit is ok after his shunt at Interlagos @FIAWEC, that was a big one matey,” tweeted 2009 Formula One world champion Jenson Button, using Webber’s Twitter address to contact the Australian.

Karan Johar signs Abhishek Varman to direct  KalankBy: BollywoodHungama.com | Mumbai |
Posted: December 1, 2014 1:05 pm
Karan Johar seems to be on a movie announcement spree and will be busy constantly switching roles as a director, producer and actor. While he will be making a full-fledged debut as an actor with Anurag Kashyap’s ‘Bombay Velvet’, he will be directing ‘Ae Dil Hai Mushkil’ with Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Ranbir Kapoor and Anushka Sharma in the lead. And now, he has announced yet another film titled ‘Kalank’, which Karan will be producing under his banner Dharma Productions.
‘Kalank’ will be directed by Abhishek Varman, who directed ‘2 States’ for the same banner. In fact, the film in question is said to have an emotional connect with Karan Johar, since his father Yash Johar was the one who conducted research on the subject of this film.
Dealing with human emotions, ‘Kalank’ is a period love story which tries to find its identity amidst the dangerous political situation during Partition. Also, from what we hear, Yash Johar had even visited Lahore for the film and it has been his dream to see the film come to life. However, it is being said that Karan Johar, after the death of his father, could not bring himself to direct it and when Abhishek expressed his wish to do a period drama, the generous producer immediately offered him this plot to develop.
The film is under pre-production currently and the cast is not yet finalized.

Motorola s new Moto X (2nd generation) review: An excellent phone  but camera a party pooper35
3
In times when flagship phones from leading smartphone makers are coming at prices close to half-a-lakh, Motorola has been releasing its top-of-the-line phones with price tags way lower than the competition. Motorola appears to have the right mix of hardware and software in what it brews, while keeping aside the gimmicks that only add to the cost.
The Rs 31,999 new Motorola flagship Moto X is another example of Motorola's smart pricing. But does this competitively priced flagship have in it what it takes to give its rivals a run for their money? Read on.
The new Moto X (second-gen) comes with 16GB of storage and is available in three variants - regular black, black leather, and bamboo white. The first one is priced at Rs 31,999, while the other two carry a price tag of Rs 33,999. The model that we got to review was the one with the wood finish.
Does the competitively priced Moto X (second generation) have in it what it takes to give its rivals a run for their money?

The new Moto X may have a beautiful display with a frontal speaker, but what attracted me in the first place was its bamboo rear shell, which makes the phone appear both classy and quirky at the same time. Its curved back, making the phone thinnest on the edges and thickest in the middle, makes it easy to grip the phone, but its mammoth 5.2-inch display takes away the ease of operating the phone with a single hand - something that is a deterrent in most large-screen phones. Adding to its beauty is a metal frame that wraps around the phone - separating the bamboo back from the front that is white in colour.
Its 5.2-inch AMOLED display with a screen resolution of 1920x1080 pixels produces vivid colours and strong contrast. From browsing the Internet to replying to emails to reading books to watching videos, it was all smooth and pleasant. With Corning Gorilla Glass atop, the display is protected against scratches.
It was all going great with the phone until I put its 13 megapixel rear camera to test in low- and soft-light conditions. The same camera that surprised me with its quality in daylight, disappointed me when I started to snap pictures in a decently lit room. The results were all grainy. The Nexus 5 performed far better in the same lighting conditions. The 13-megapixel camera at the rear comes with a dual-LED ring flash to throw balanced light. The flash while did a decent job in illuminating the otherwise dark area, it couldn't do much in reducing noise in pictures. The phone's 2-megapixel front camera is apt for video calling.
The burst mode is one of the key highlights of the new Moto X's camera. It lets you take multiple shots in one go just by holding down on display, helping you capture the best shot. I used it most of the time in capturing fast-moving subjects.
Unlike the flagships of today, the new Moto X does not come with a wide range of camera features on board. But then it can not be seen as a downside given that only a handful of those ample camera features are actually used - with rest of them are either tagged gimmicks or simply don't come to use in practical application.
Slow-motion, ultra HD (4K) videos, HDR and Panorama are some other features of the Moto X's camera app.
In India, the new Moto X only comes with 16GB of storage (out of which around 10 GB is user accessible) with no expansion capability. The 16GB of memory space may appear to be too much in the beginning, but in reality, this amount of storage space is unlikely to suffice a power user. It would have been better had it come with minimum of 32GB of internal storage.
At its heart is a 2.5GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 with quad-core CPU paired with 2GB of RAM. The powerful processor powering the Moto X is the one you will find in the Sony Xperia Z3, LG G3, Samsung Galaxy S5 and other high-end phones from key rivals. The monster beating under the hood made my experience smooth and delivered a performance free of lags and freezes.
Running Android 4.4.4 KitKat, the phone offers experience close to native Android. This is something we have seen on other Motorola phones also. (The new Moto X will be one of the first phones to receive Android 5.0 Lollipop update. Motorola says to release the update soon.)
With the view to improve user experience, the company has included a few gesture controls in the new Moto X, with only a couple of them proved to be handy. For instance, it lets you silence calls and snooze alarms simply by waving your hand; you can twist your wrist twice quickly to launch the camera app - without even going to the lock screen.
Setting up voice to control the phone hands-free didn't work for me. First it asked me to look for a quiet place so I had to wait for that moment when I was alone and it was all quiet around me. When I found myself in a quiet environment and started the process, it failed to pick out the phrase I was using to set up voice and instead told me I was speaking it too loudly. After various attempts I gave up. I tried the same after a few days, but in vain.
The phone that accommodates a nano SIM has a powerful speaker at the front which generated clear and loud results - even in noisy environments.
The second-gen Moto X has its own set of cons, but its aggressive pricing is what makes it a worthy rival.
Word of advice: If you are an avid mobile photographer, you can give this phone a skip.

KOHIMA: Focusing on improving connectivity to the Northeast, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said the Centre would provide Rs 28,000 crore for laying new railway lines in the region and develop the "untapped" tourism potential of the area.
The Prime Minister also said that the Centre has sanctioned Rs 5000 crore to provide 2G mobile coverage in this area for comprehensive telecom development plan of the northeast region.
"So many tourists are coming here from other parts of the country and abroad. This is the best destination for tourists. But for that we require connectivity. Unless we have road connectivity, rail connectivity, air connectivity, it is very difficult to develop tourism.
"That is why for the development of this area and for the development of tourism, Rs 28,000 crore will be provided for a new railway-line project and 14 new railway lines", he said inaugurating Nagaland's biggest annual Hornbill festival here.
"I believe that the Hornbill Festival will improve the tourism sector in Nagaland and the people of India will be the beneficiary," he said.
As energy is a lifeline for development, Rs 5000 crore has been sanctioned for the northeastern region power system improvement project for six states, including Nagaland, the Prime Minister said.
"Our goal is 24X7, 365 days power supply and to achieve that we are focusing on the northeastern states.
"Nowadays the infrastructure meaning has totally changed. Besides road and rail connectivity, we require digital connectivity. Internet connectivity is most required. Now the youth cannot stay without mobile phones, without Internet," he said.
The Prime Minister said his government has decided to set up a National Sports University in Manipur and the people of the region will be "great beneficiaries".
The NE region could be the organic capital of the country, Modi said, adding that the Centre has decided to set up six new agriculture colleges in this area.

Rs 64K cr lying unclaimed: Here s how you can get it | Six ways to help you save taxCentral Provident Fund
(Assuming a nominal rate…)
MUMBAI: An estimated Rs 37,300 crore is lying unclaimed with insurance companies, banks, corporate houses and the Post Office department. If you add the Rs 26,497 crore lying in inoperative provident fund accounts with the EPFO, the total wealth idling without interest adds up to nearly Rs. 64,000 crore.
Assuming a nominal rate of 8.5%, investors are losing more than Rs. 5,400 crore in interest every year. The interest alone can buy out a mid-sized bank such as Corporation Bank, which has a market capitalisation of Rs 5,367 crore. This estimate does not include many small savings schemes, data for which is unavailable.
One unconfirmed estimate has pegged the unclaimed amount and inoperative accounts in the Public Provident Fund (PPF) at Rs 22,000 crore. That's not unbelievable..
In July, in response to an RTI petition by Aseem Takyar, the Post Office department had divulged that Indira Vikas Patra maturity proceeds worth Rs 896 crore are lying unclaimed in government coffers.
The amount is enough to buy the entire equity of Financial Technologies, which has a market Rs 844 crore. Three months ago, the government set up a committee headed by RBI deputy governor HR Khan to find out how much of unclaimed deposits were lying with the Post Office department and PSU banks. The Khan Committee will submit its report by December 31.
The Post Office department is not the only black hole that has swallowed investors' wealth. Life insurance companies have Rs 5,849 crore of unpaid benefits in their coffers. The Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) has the biggest chunk (Rs 1,548 crore) of unclaimed wealth but Reliance Life Insurance is not far behind with Rs 1,502 crore. Banks too are wallowing in this unclaimed wealth, with Rs 5,125 crore waiting to be collected by depositors and account holders. Then there are corporate houses, which have roughly Rs 3,454 crore in unpaid dividends, unclaimed debentures and deposits.
The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) is also sitting on a massive Rs 26,496 crore in inoperative PF accounts. A PF account is classified as inoperative if there is no deposit for more than three years. Under a new rule introduced in 2011, no interest is payable on the balance in an inoperative account.
EPFO officials say that many of these inoperative accounts belong to people who have changed jobs and not transferred the balance from the previous account. Central Provident Fund Commissioner Krishan Kumar Jalan says the introduction of the Universal Account Numbers (UAN) will help the EPFO trace the owners of the inoperative accounts.
If an amount lying with companies, banks and mutual funds is unclaimed for more than seven years, it is transferred to Sebi's Investor Education and Protection Fund (IEPF). Investors can reclaim the amount by approaching either the fund house, the company or the registrar. Similarly , the RBI has established a Depositor Education and Awareness Fund (DEAF), where unclaimed deposits and bank balances of inoperative accounts flow in after waiting for 10 years.
One can claim this amount even after this transfer. If the accountholder furnishes identity proof, the bank will have to return the amount along with interest applicable.

How VMware plans to tap the $60 billion opp...How VMware's three point strategy is helping it address $60 billion market
Mehak Chawla, ECONOMICTIMES.COM Dec 1, 2014, 03.38PM IST

Airwatch
More than a year back, VMware's CEO, Pat Gelsinger, thought about re-inventing the company to tap the huge cloud market opportunity. Soon after he took the reins of the company, Gelsinger identified three strategic priorities for VMware. They were hybrid cloud, end user computing and software defined data centers. These three components put together, present a $60 billion opportunity worldwide.
More than 50 per cent of this opportunity lies in the software defined data center space ($33 billion), followed by hybrid cloud ($17 billion) and then end-user computing ($10 billion). These three strategic areas are redefining the company that was only recognized as a virtualization vendor. And while VMware seeks to transform their customer's businesses, the IT biggie itself is undergoing a massive business transformation.
All about integration
According to Shankar Iyer, Vice President of Products for Desktop Solutions, End-User Computing Group, VMware, a crucial part of this three pronged strategy is that all these three pillars integrate well with each other. "Part of the reason is that each of those three pillars has a great potential to deeply integrate with the other. So, internally, we have done that. End user computing, you know, we've integrated with the software defined datacenter in multiple ways. We have actually driven innovation in the graphics area in the software defined datacenter part. Same thing with the hybrid cloud service which we are using extensively."
Iyer believes the better integrated stack they have as an offering, the more embedded they can be in a customer environment. "The reason we are keeping the three priorities and not creating the fourth one is because we know that just by fulfilling this; our total addressable market is about 60 billion dollars. So we are happy to get about 20 per cent of that."
While hybrid cloud and software defined data centers are an obvious progression for a virtualization company, VMware's interest in end user computing is part of a larger trend. Like other data center space players, VMware is also looking to make its way into the end user computing game. For most part, it is the mobility wave that is driving this trend. "When it comes to end user computing the mindset has shifted significantly over the last year and I think it is only going to accelerate. I think the big reason for that- if you have to capture it in one word, it is mobility. What mobility has done is that it has forced corporations to fundamentally rethink the way their current end user computing works. So mobility is paramount in most companies and this is true across the world. Business mobility is something which you will hang your hands on," Iyer told ET.
  Mobility is now a transformation game for enterprises across, and that is the pie that IT players are after. VMware's acquisition of AirWatch, one of the leading players in mobile device management earlier this year, is the company's biggest bet on end user computing so far.
Iyer tells us that AirWatch has gone a long way in establishing VMware in the end user game. "I think it's a very relevant acquisition because if you want to be in an end user computing play, you have to own mobile management. If you look at mobile management, it was pioneered really by three companies - AirWatch, Mobileiron and Zenprise. This acquisition is great for us because since AirWatch has been in the VMware folder, they've actually separated themselves even more from the competition."
Establishing Synergies
The big difference that this three pillared approach has bought to VMware is being reflected in synergies within the organization. Iyer explained, "I think we will end up doing a lot more solution selling. That's the truth across VMware by the way. We are doing a lot more solution selling across the stack because we are able to offer solutions that are fundamentality transformational to our business." Pat Gelsinger said something similar in the last VMworld "We are becoming strategic partner for lot of companies- something that wasn't true earlier".
What this redefining of market opportunity, coupled with some right acquisitions, has done for VMware has affected their go-to-market significantly. It has translated into more solution selling, working with companies top to bottom, and entering multiple kinds of partnerships. Their recent partnership with TCS, where the companies will jointly create a customer Center of Excellence, is one such example.
"The other thing is that now since we are now providing cloud based offerings, we can offer it through smaller cloud service providers and smaller partners to go add value on top of a platform. So it is definitely broadening our go-to-market and allowing us to get customers top to bottom," Iyer added.

Sensex Falls 134 Points Ahead of RBI Review; ONGC, RIL Slump Over 3%
Reuters | Updated On: December 01, 2014 16:48 (IST)
Oil Slumps Near $59 for First Time Since 2009 on Oversupply
Mumbai: The Nifty retreated from a record high on Monday as blue chips fell on risk aversion in global markets after gold and oil tumbled, while caution also prevailed a day ahead of the Reserve Bank of India's policy review.
Plunging prices for commodities, hit by slowing factory activity in China and Europe, raised fears of deflation and hammered emerging market stocks and commodity-linked currencies.
Investors await the apex bank's policy review on Tuesday with markets already pricing in a rate cut amid a slump in crude oil prices, although only 4 out of 45 economists in a Reuters poll said the RBI will cut rates.
"It will be mistake if RBI doesn't cut rates on Tuesday. You can't sit in an island of inflation amid a crude oil slump and world worrying about low growth," said G Chokkalingam, founder of Equinomics, a research and fund advisory firm.
The 50-shares Nifty closed down 0.38 per cent at 8,555.90, after earlier hitting a record high of 8,623.
The benchmark BSE Sensex ended 0.47 per cent lower at 28,559.62, snapping its three-day gaining streak.
India's outperformance in 2014 and the over-exposure of emerging market funds are also prompting investors to lock in profits.
Credit Suisse trimmed India overweight to 10 per cent from 15 per cent versus emerging market benchmarks.
Oil explorers led the falls after oil slid to five-year lows in its longest losing streak since 2008.
Reliance Industries fell 2.4 per cent, Oil and Natural Gas Corp ended down 3.9 per cent and Cairn India lost 1.5 per cent.
Select lenders also fell. Housing Development Finance Corp fell 2 per cent while State Bank of India lost 0.6 per cent.
Larsen & Toubro fell 1.1 per cent on worries lower crude prices may lead to lower investment and order flows from the Middle East.
Mahindra & Mahindra lost 2.2 per cent after its November vehicle sales fell 13 per cent on year.
Among gainers, crude oil users rose on hopes of higher operating margins and increased discretionary spend in the economy.
Jet Airways gained 7.9 per cent, Apollo Tyres rose 2 per cent while Hindustan Petroleum Corp was up 1.2 per cent.
Berger Paints surged 12 per cent while Asian Paints advanced 7 per cent.
Jewellery firms also surged after India scrapped a rule that mandated trading companies to export 20 per cent of the gold imported.
Titan Company gained 5.2 per cent, Tribhovandas Bhimji Zaveri jumped 19.1 per cent and Gitanjali Gems surged 19.9 per cent, while PC Jewellers ended up 2.5 per cent.

Gold Extends Losses on Weak Global Cues
Press Trust of India | Updated On: December 01, 2014 15:54 (IST)
Oil Slumps Near $59 for First Time Since 2009 on Oversupply
New Delhi: Gold prices declined by Rs 200 at Rs 26,200 per ten grams in the national capital today amidst weak trend overseas and increased supplies in domestic spot markets after the Reserve Bank eased import curbs.
Besides, fall in demand from jewellers and retailers at prevailing levels on expectations of further drop in precious metal prices in coming days dampened the trading sentiments, traders said.
In line with overall weak trends, silver extended its slide and recorded a steep fall of Rs 1,080 to Rs 34,300 per kg on reduced offtake by industrial units and coin makers.
Traders said sentiment turned distinctly weak after gold prices slumped in global markets as Swiss voters rejected a plan for their central bank to accumulate bullion and oil extended its decline to five-year low, curbing demand for the precious metal.
Silver also plunged to the lowest level since 2009 as the dollar climbed.
Further, pick-up in supplies supported by RBI easing curbs on import of the precious metal by scrapping 80:20 scheme also put pressure on gold prices, they said.
"Gold may see further fall in its prices in coming days and is likely to touch Rs 25,500-mark as supplies started picking up after the RBI move," All India Sarafa Association vice-president Sureinder Kumar Jain said.
Globally, gold in Singapore, which normally sets price trend on the domestic front, fell 2.1 per cent to $1,142.88 an ounce, the lowest level since November 7 and silver nosedived by over 8 per cent to
$14.42 an ounce, the lowest price since August 2009.
In Delhi, gold of 99.9 and 99.5 per cent purity plunged by Rs 200 each to Rs 26,200 and Rs 26,000 per ten grams, respectively.
The precious metal had lost Rs 530 in the past five days. Sovereign, however, held steady at Rs 23,600 per piece of eight grams in limited deals.
In a similar fashion, silver ready tumbled by Rs 1,080 to Rs 34,300 per kg and weekly-based delivery by Rs 605 to Rs 33,920 per kg.
Silver coins also plunged by Rs 3,000 to Rs 58,000 for buying and Rs 59,000 for selling of 100 pieces.

Mergers and acquisitions have to be encouraged to promote the size of domestic companies but there is also a need to understand when to draw the red line while implementing the competition law, Corporate Affairs Minister Arun Jaitley said today.
He also underlined the need for applying the "principle of proportionality" while taking into consideration the consequences of competition norms.
"People learn from global experience. When our own corporates are of moderate size, mergers, acquisitions and consolidation need to be encouraged to promote size.
So when it is that we draw the red line (in implementing competition law)," Jaitley said.
According to him, Competition Commission of India (CCI) is becoming "extremely mature".
M&As involving significant business activities and those meeting a certain threshold under competition norms are required to get clearance from CCI.
Jaitley was inaugurating the International Competition Network (ICN) Merger workshop here, organised by CCI.
"Another issue, what are the kind of consequences and penalties that we impose in the larger implementation of the law. Do we look at the evil sought to be curbed (or) the capacity of our own economy and therefore apply the principle of proportionality," the minister said.
Emphasising that people learn from global experiences, Jaitley said "jurisdiction" is emerging with regard to common turf issues on account of multiple regulators.
"If two telecom majors are to amalgamate, will there be common turf areas between the telecom regulator and market regulator CCI. Therefore how do you built the jurisdiction of the two. Obviously jurisdiction in this area is emerging," he noted.

Indian software mkt grows 10.7% in H1 2014: IDCCAGR
(Political stability and…)
NEW DELHI: Political stability and improving economic sentiments have helped the software market in India grow by 10.7 per cent in January-June 2014 period as compared to first half of previous year, research firm IDC said today.
The formation of a stable NDA government resulted in some amount of positivity in the market which reflected in IT investments by major verticals like banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), retail, manufacturing and e-commerce, IDC said in a statement.
The period also saw few of the big vendors closing major deals which were in the pipeline since early 2013 but did not materialise owing to economic and political uncertainties, it added.
Though IDC did not disclose the size of the market in the first half of 2014, it had pegged the Indian IT software market at Rs 10,913 crore in January-June 2013 period.
IDC expects the software market to grow at a stable pace in the next five years (2014-2018) with a healthy CAGR of 10.5 per cent.
Some of the areas which are expected to witness software uptake are mobile application development & mobile device management, security software, system software, analytics and engineering applications, IDC said.
In the January-June 2014 period, Microsoft led with 31.8 per cent share of the software vendor market, followed by Oracle at 12 per cent, SAP (6.5 per cent), IBM (5.5 per cent) and Synopsys (4.2 per cent).
BFSI, manufacturing and communication & media were the top verticals which invested in upgrades and new licenses.
Some of the sectors to watch out for in future include entertainment , retail, e-commerce, education and hospitality, IDC said.
"There has been a shift in the mindset of users across these industries. IT investments are now made not only for process improvements but also for growing business opportunities and improving customer experience," it added.
Some of the solutions which were readily accepted across verticals included customer analytics, mobile solutions, cloud solutions, customer management solutions, omni-channel management systems, data loss prevention etc.
Government initiatives like Mobile Seva, Digital India, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana and the likes will be instrumental in triggering adoption of software solutions in the coming years, IDC said.
Launch of various schemes and policies is expected to catalyse software uptake by manufacturing, retail, travel & tourism and BFSI in the coming 2-3 years, it added.

Motherson Sumi's German Acquisition to Be EPS Accretive
New Delhi: As UB Group continues to face growing shareholder activism, its chairman Vijay Mallya on Monday resigned as a director of group entity Mangalore Chemicals and Fertilizers Ltd (MCFL) without giving any reasons.
"Dr Vijay Mallya, a Director on the Board of Directors of the Company, has resigned with immediate effect," MCFL said in a filing to stock exchanges.
There was no reason provided for the resignation, which came within days of minority shareholders of United Spirits rejecting 9 out of 12 resolutions including those pertaining to pacts with entities connected to erstwhile promoter Mr Mallya. ( Read more )
The resignation, which was followed by a sharp 15 per cent spike in MCFL share price, also comes close on the heels of two unsuccessful open offers to wrest control of the company.
Mr Mallya had joined forces with Kolkata-based industrialist Saroj Kumar Poddar to launch a counter offer to Deepak Fertilizer and Petrochemicals' open offer.
Deepak Fertilizers managed to raise its stake to around 32 per cent in MCFL while the Mallya-Poddar combine holds around 38 per cent.
MCFL's board is being restructured to include two representatives of Mr Poddar's Adventz Group.
Shares of MCFL rose 15.3 per cent to Rs 94.05 apiece on the BSE soon after the announcement but closed a bit lower at Rs 89.85 - a gain of Rs 8.25 or 10.11 per cent over Friday's close.

London: A British space consultant will charge people 50 pounds or so to place a sample of their DNA in an archive to be buried on the Moon.
Called Lunar Mission One, the archive is the brainchild of David Iron, who has worked on Skynet, the UK spy satellite network, and Galileo, the European Union's global positioning system.
He will offer people a chance to place a sample of their DNA, in the form of a strand of hair, in an archive to be buried on the Moon, alongside a digital history of as much of their lives as they want to record.
People will be given a chance to place a sample of their DNA, in the form of a strand of hair, in an archive to be buried on the Moon.
#moon #dna #lunar mission one #david iron
However, Iron needs at least 10 million people to do this if he is to generate the 500 million pounds the moon shot will need, 'New Scientist' reported.
Iron and his colleagues have launched a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter to raise the initial 600,000 pounds of seed funding needed to set up the company to commission designs for the spacecraft, which it is hoped will blast off in 2024.
Iron is working with the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Harwell, UK.
Lunar Mission One plans to land a robotic spacecraft on the Moon's south pole. It will then drill at least 20 metres into the lunar crust, extracting core samples to be analysed on the craft.
"No lunar or planetary mission of any kind has ever drilled to a significant depth below the surface. The deepest Apollo drill core was only 3 metres long," said Ian Crawford at Birkbeck College, London, Lunar Mission One's chief planetary scientist.
"The drill will enable the geothermal gradient, and thus lunar heatflow, to be measured for the first time," Crawford said.
After about six months, capsules containing the DNA and digital data will be injected into the borehole, which will then be sealed.

Mahindra reports 13% fall in November car salesMahindra & Mahindra reports 13 per cent fall in November car sales
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: December 1, 2014  | 16:50 IST
(Photo: Reuters)
Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), the home-grown auto major, on Monday reported 13 per cent decline in total sales at 34,292 units in November.
M&M had sold 39,254 units in the Nov 2013, the company said in a statement.
The auto major 's domestic sales declined by 11 per cent to 32,100 units in October 2014 as against 36,261 units in the corresponding year-ago period.
Sales of passenger vehicles including Scorpio, XUV 500, Xylo , Bolero and Verito fell by 18 per cent to 13,765 units in the reporting month, compared to 16,771 units in November 2013.
In October 2014 , the carmaker's four-wheel commercial vehicle sales were down by 3 per cent to 12,748 units as against 13,186 units in the year-ago month, M&M said.
M&M Chief Executive Automotive Division and International Operations Pravin Shah said, "The auto industry continues its sluggish demand on the back of factors such as low consumer sentiments and high interest rates."
The slumping international crude oil prices and the subsequent lowering of fuel prices should help in the revival of demand in the coming months, Shah added.
"We also hope that the current excise duty rates will be extended beyond end of December to get much needed recovery for the auto industry," the executive said.
The company 's exports were down 27 per cent in November to 2,192 units from 2,993 units in the same period a year ago.
"We continue to be optimistic on the back of a good response for our new generation Scorpio and a comparatively better performance of our 4 wheeler commercial segment," Shah added.

Heavy fine for Jayalalithaa  pays Rs 2 crore for closure of IT casesWritten by Arun Janardhanan | Chennai |
Posted: December 1, 2014 4:27 pm | Updated: December 1, 2014 6:51 pm
With the centre’s decision to facilitate the settlement of a set of tax cases against AIADMK supremo J Jayalalithaa and her confidante Sasikala, both of them have paid a sum of Rs 2 crore for all the four income-tax cases on Monday. The government has informed the metropolitan court in Chennai, which was trying the economic offenses, about the payment of fine on Monday. Final order from the department of revenue is awaited before the closure of the case.
Last week, The Indian Express reported the union Law Ministry’s opinion concluding that the “discretionary powers” vested with the concerned Chief Commissioner of the revenue department may be exercised to settle the case.
The cases were registered after Jayalalithaa, Sasikala and their company – Sasi Enterprises — had failed to file their I-T returns from 1993-94 and 1996-97.
The centre had given the opinion and facilitated the settlement by compounding of the cases after the Supreme Court had asked the department to wrap up their probe by 2014-end.
The only legal hurdle to prevent the settlement option was that a set of guidelines that prevent compounding of the cases if they are linked to any anti-national or terrorist activities or being investigated by the CBI or Enforcement Directorate.
However, the Law Ministry, ensuring a legal room for settlement, had clarified that no such clauses were applicable in the case against Jayalalithaa and her associates.

China to develop more aircraft carriersChina to develop more aircraft carriers

(China plans to build more…)
BEIJING: Buoyed by successful trials of its first aircraft carrier, China plans to build more new carriers as it looks to spread out its global naval presence in the midst of maritime disputes with a host of neighbours.
China is planning to build more aircraft carriers in addition to the two-year-old Liaoning, which it purchased from Ukraine and commissioned in 2012, state-run Global Times reported today.
Although Chinese authorities have never openly confirmed whether a homemade carrier is underway, they have also never denied it.
Ministry of National Defense spokesman Yang Yujun said last August that although the Liaoning is China's first aircraft carrier, "there will surely be more in future."
He said China will consider the development of aircraft carriers in accordance with its national defense needs.
Military experts confirm that the country needs at least three carriers to form a basic battle force, the Global Times report said.
Du Wenlong, a research fellow at the PLA Academy of Military Science , told the daily that China should deploy at least that amount.
With three carriers, one is always available for operational missions, while the second is used for training and the third is re-supplied and retrofitted.
Du also said that most missions require at least two carriers working together.
While China was involved in maritime disputes with Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan in South China Sea, it competed with Japan over asserting its sovereignty over the disputed islands in the East China Sea.
Chinese navy too scaled up its presence in the Indian Ocean, where China has funded a number of ports in Sri Lanka and other countries.
China recently denied reports that it plans to establish 18 naval bases while asserting that it submarine's presence in Colombo port was only for refueling purposes.
Although Chinese authorities have claimed that China's aircraft carrier is not being built with a specific target in mind, military experts said that to maintain China's maritime rights Chinese navy will have to break the "first island chain" blockade to gain access to the Indian Ocean, the report said.
The Chinese navy's experience in testing and training on the Liaoning will have important implications for China's future homemade carriers, it said.
Experts say China's military logistics infrastructure will soon be mature enough to allow the country's new homemade carrier, once completed and commissioned, to form a powerful battle force, it said.

Nagaland Chief Minister T R Zeliang on Monday appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for an early resolution by the Centre to the six-decade-old Naga political issue.
“Our crying need is the peaceful resolution to the vexed Naga political issue, which has become the uppermost agenda of not only the state government, but also the mass based organizations, NGOs, civil societies, business organizations along with the rest of the people of the state,” the CM said in his address during the 10-day-long Hornbill Festival ofNagaland, which was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Kisama, about 12 km from the state capital.
“It is only under your (Modi) leadership that our most cherished dream will become a reality,” he said, adding that the people of Nagaland want peace and want to grow to be a self-reliant state on equal terms with the other advanced states of the country.
He also assured the Prime Minister that the state government and the people of Nagaland will stand by him, as he sets goals for the country’s future and as he steers the country to its rightful place in the comity of nations.The Nagaland Chief Minister said that even after 50 years of statehood, the true potential of the state was yet to be fully harnessed and the advantages that the state has, such as the rich cultural heritage, its natural beauty and abundant natural resources, and its strategic location are yet to be truly exploited to the state’s advantage.
Towards the end, he said the state has many needs and many areas where “we require active handholding from the Government of India”. “We expect and hope that this visit of yours (PM) may become a boon for the people of Nagaland,” he said.

How to become a greenCEOWritten by Keshav Chaturvedi | New Delhi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 5:16 pm | Updated: December 1, 2014 5:17 pm
Today, CEOs can play a role that even many politicians can’t in changing the face of the cities and society.
Recently the great-great grandson of Rockefellers, the legendary American family that earned it’s billions by being the pioneers in exploiting oil globally, announced that they would disinvest from oil in the next five years and invest instead in clean energy and technologies.
The implications of such a move are that it would bring $50 billion in the clean technology market. This is the power of a Chief Executive Officer (CEO). He or she can change the world because of the immense financial, technical and human resource capital at their disposal.
Today, CEOs can play a role that even many politicians can’t in changing the face of the cities and society. They can take three decisions to make the world a better place. As the industry uses copious amount of resources they can initiate performance linked incentives across the board in their companies for those who innovate in the company processes to bring down the usage of natural resources without compromising the output and its quality.
This way they will use the inherent talent within the company to achieve a level of efficient use of resources and save wastage as well as over exploitation of natural resources, thus delaying their degradation.
They should also work towards promoting energy efficiency as most of the banks don’t finance energy efficiency project. Investments in this sector will save millions and also bring down the use of natural resources.
Third they should work on a new vision statement where the company uses it’s extra funds to invest in technologies that help society move away from fossil fuel like petrol diesel and coal to cleaner energies like solar, wind and geothermal.
They should also enlist other CEO in their trade associations to lobby with the government to change archaic laws to promote efficiency in production, energy use and renewable energy.
CEOs can sue their corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds to promote greening of degraded forest land, cleaning water bodies and promoting sanitation and hygiene.

Chhattisgarh: 13 CRPF personnel killed in MaoistambushWritten by Ashutosh Bhardwaj | Raipur |
Posted: December 2, 2014 12:05 am | Updated: December 2, 2014 9:54 am
In the CRPF’s biggest single-day casualty in Chhattisgarh this year, 14 of its personnel, including two officers, were killed in a Maoist attack in Chintagufa area of Sukma district on Monday afternoon. At least 15 personnel have been injured — five are reported to be in a serious condition.

The victims, including Deputy Commandant D S Verma and Assistant Commandant Rajesh Kapuria, were from the 223 battalion of the CRPF.
“Our parties were inside (the forest) for an operation when the Maoists ambushed them. Fourteen personnel were killed,” confirmed ADG (Naxal Ops) R K Vij. The incident took place deep in the forest, around 10 km southwest of the last police camp at Chintagufa.
According to reports, a huge team of over 550 CRPF and state personnel had left the police camps in Chintagufa and Kankerlanka for the operation on Saturday. One party was led by CRPF IG (Chhattisgarh) H S Siddhu.
At around 2 pm today, the security personnel reportedly faced Maoist resistance near Tondamarka village in Kasarpad. Maoists opened heavy fire, and the ambush lasted for over an hour. The rebels also looted a significant number of weapons.
“The forces have returned to the Chintagufa camp. The chopper could not fly because of low light,” said Vij. Air support could not be provided to rescue the injured personnel and get the bodies.
Today’s incident took place in the same region where seven personnel were injured in a Maoist attack just over a week back, when the rebels had managed to hit the Mi 17 that had been sent to evacuate the injured. Considered a “liberated zone”, the forces have rarely been able to venture into this area.
“It is a challenge for the country. I am personally hurt by this incident,” said Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh today. He said he would reach Sukma distrct tomorrow.
The attack has come at a time when Chhattisgarh has been citing record Naxal surrenders in the last six months. Just yesterday, Chief Minister Raman Singh had said “the Maoists would be finished from Chhattisgarh soon”.
The CRPF has recently undertaken massive operations in the interior areas of Sukma.
Singh, who was in New Delhi, curtailed his visit and is returning tonight. He will hold a high-level meeting of senior officers.
The attack also comes a day before the People’s Liberation of Guerrilla Army of the CPI (Maoist) is set to begin its foundation week from December 2-8.
Significantly, a delegation of the National Security Advisory Board is in Chhattisgarh these days to review the Maoist situation in the state.

Suspended police inspector R L Mavani got bail in the Sadiq Jamal Mehtar encounter case by a special CBI court. This was the first bail granted in this case where the CBI has seen a direct role of Intelligence Bureau officials in the custodial killing of Sadiq.
The same court also denied bail to  retired Deputy Superintendent of Police (DySP) also known as “encounter specialist” Barot . He  is lodged in jail for almost two years now in connection with the encounter case.
The CBI judge M M Gandhi rejected after hearing both the applications jointly and had reserved the order for pronouncement last week.
The CBI has chargesheeted eight cops in the case including Barot and Mavani for killing Bhavnagar youth Sadiq in January 2003 in a fake police encounter. He was branded as a terrorist who had plans to kill the then chief minister Narendra Modi and VHP leader Pravin Togadia to avenge 2002 riots.
In this case, officers of Mumbai police and IB officers of Mumbai Subsidiary Intelligence Unit are also alleged to be involved. It has been claimed by the CBI that Sadiq was handed over to Gujarat police days before he was killed.

Markets can expect another quantitative easing in US  says Russell Napier  ERICChina
ET Now caught up with Russell Napier , Strategist, ERIC , shares his views on the global macroeconomic situation. Excerpts:
ET Now: How do you think the US Fed is likely to respond to the imminent threat of deflation?
Russell Napier: My view is that the US Fed would be back with more quantitative easing...
ET Now: So, we will have a QE4?
Russell Napier: I suspect we would have QE-4. I do not think the US economy is as robust as we think it is. Especially if it gets hit by these external headwinds, it could come off quite sharply. There are people who think we might import deflation to America and thus facilitate a disinflationary boom, which will encourage more consumption and induce a situation like the 1990s. However, my view is pretty different. With the real rate of interest likely to go up, the economic growth will probably slow down and inflation and nominal rates would not come down, whereas the real rates will be going up. The US Fed was able to cut nominal rates back in 1990s, but I do not think it will be possible now. Fundamentally, the baby boom generation is a completely different play and does not necessary respond to lower prices of goods by consuming more. Hence, I am not optimistic on the United States.
ET Now: What would trigger Europe, emerging markets or the rest of the world outside of the US to step into a strong deflationary environment?
Russell Napier: I will give you the specific set of things that could happen. There will be a dramatic decline in the yen, which would instantly lead to Japan selling products much cheaper in dollar terms. Although, eventually Japan might generate some inflation and it might inflate away some of the competitive mis-gains, but in the early stages, Japan will be selling things cheaper - signalling deflation.
The second order impact will probably be worse. This deflation would undermine the competitive position of Japan's competitors and therefore, say a country like China would find itself under extreme pressure on its exchange rate, if the yen falls to 150. China will have to respond with lower exchange rates.
Thirdly, a situation will be there wherein you have a piece of credit system which defaults or is likely to default, leading to a seizure of credit. In recent history, that happened with Lehman Brothers. If we go back to 1990, it was Russia, and if we go back to 1980, it was Mexico.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, dressed in traditional Naga attire, waves a spear and a sword during the inauguration of the 10-day Hornbill festival in Kisama village in Nagaland, on Monday.
TOPICS
heads of state
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said the entire Northeast region has a “Natural Economic Zone (NEZ)” and said that it would be his priority to nourish the NEZ and tap its potential for the benefit of the region.
Inaugurating the Hornbill Festival of Nagaland at Kisama Heritage village, 10 km off the State capital Kohima, the Prime Minister said that while other parts of the country have SEZ (Special Economic Zone) which are man-made, the NEZ in Northeast are natural but yet to be tapped.
'Capital of organic agriculture'
He also described the Northeast region as India’s “capital of organic agriculture” and said six new agriculture colleges would set up in the region.
Greeting the people of Nagaland on the occasion of the 51 st Statehood Day, Mr. Modi urged them to introspect and look back at what has been achieved over the last 50 years, and what ground remains to be covered.
Saying that Nagaland has been blessed with a rich bio-diversity and English-speaking young population, the Prime Minister —dressed as a traditional Naga Warrior-- said that it was an advantage for the State to attract tourists and to capture a part of the global IT outsourcing business.
Hornbill Festival
Describing the Hornbill festival as a “world famous festival”, the Prime Minister congratulated the people of Nagaland for organising it to preserve and promote the unique cultural diversity and rich oral tradition. He praised the Naga people for their rich cultural heritage and the sturdiness, honesty, simplicity, inherent strong character and hardworking attitude.
Highlighting the initiatives taken by his government for the Northeast region, Mr. Modi said that a modern apparel and garment manufacturing centre would be set up immediately in the State capitals of Assam, Nagaland and Sikkim. He also announced the Ishan Uday special scholarships for 10,000 students from the Northeast, and the Ishan Vikas scheme for facilitating exposure visits of 2000 students and 500 teachers of colleges in the region to other parts of the country every year.
‘Will come here often’
Mr. Modi said it was a decade since former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had visited Nagaland. “I want to assure you that you will not have to wait for so long again for a Prime Minister’s visit. I will be happy to come often to see that all that I have mentioned becomes a reality,” he added at the inaugural function of the 10-day long festival in the presence of Nagaland Chief Minister T.R. Zeliang and Governor P.B. Acharya.
He said his government has earmarked Rs. 53000 crore in the Union Budget for development of the Northeast. Besides, Rs. 28,000 crore has been earmarked for construction of new railway lines to boost connectivity and Rs. 5000 crore for improvement of intra-state power transmission systems and Rs. 5000 crore for 2G mobile connectivity in the region.

PM Modi should go to people with confidence building measures: PDPPress Trust of India | Dec 01, 2014 at 04:26pm IST
Srinagar: Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Monday said that instead of displaying political might, Prime Minister Narendra Modi should reach out to the people of Jammu and Kashmir with tangible confidence building measures for providing a healing touch to their sufferings.
"Instead of creating an impression that BJP is trying to conquer Jammu and Kashmir through political might, Modi should reach out to the people of the State with tangible confidence building measures to provide a healing touch to their sufferings," PDP's Lok Sabha member Tariq Hamid Karra said.
Addressing a series of election meetings in Batmaloo constituency of Srinagar, Karra alleged, "BJP and RSS are not only polarizing people on communal and ethnic lines, but an impression is fast gaining ground in Kashmir that the Saffron brigade is trying to conquer the State using political might and timeserving proxies."
"The political subversion and uncertainty that the state has faced in the last seven decades has already taken a heavy toll on its polity," Karra said.
He alleged that BJP's affronting show of might in Kashmir is loaded with "dangerous" consequences and it could fuel fresh wave of alienation and distrust among the people, especially the youth.
"The political subversion and uncertainty that the state has faced in the last seven decades has already taken a heavy toll on its polity, economy and human resource and it can ill afford any further disruption," Karra said.

New Delhi: A Congress member on Monday asked the government to desist from any move to "dismantle" the Planning Commission and sought steps to strengthen it.
Raising the issue during Zero Hour, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the Planning Commission is an important independent institution which has been guiding the development of various states.
"If there is any deficiency, that should be mended and not ended. You should not dismantle it but rejuvenate it," he said.

His party colleague T Meinya asked the government to immediately table MP Bezbaruah Committee Report and take steps to stop attacks on the people of the northeast staying in other parts of the country and put an end to "racial profiling".
He said people from the northeast were being "targetted and attacked" in Delhi and other metros and there have been five such incidents in the recent past one after another.
Bhratruhari Mahtab (BJD) urged the government to celebrate the birth anniversary of Raja Mahendra Pratap, a stalwart of the Indian freedom movement who had established the first Indian government-in-exile in 1915 in Kabul.
Mahendra Pratap had donated everything he owned to the cause of the people and the freedom movement, including land, for establishing the Aligarh Muslim University, he said. While AMU should establish a Chair in his name, the government should also promote research on his activities in the freedom struggle.
Shashi Tharoor (Congress) wanted the government to establish a railway medical college and hospital in Thiruvananthapuram for which land has already been identified through public-private partnership mode.
TRS member A Sitaram Naik raised the issue seven mandals in Telangana which were located in Andhra Pradesh, but two MLAs and two MPs representing them belonged to Telangana.
He demanded an urgent solution to the problem to provide representation of the people, mostly tribals, living in these mandals.

On the very first day of this new government in the Parliament, we had a discussion on price rise. We formed SIT on black money as asked by the Supreme Court. Congress must not trivialise the issues.

Both Kohli and Pandher were sentenced to death, but later the Allahabad High Court acquitted Pandher and upheld Kohli's death sentence.

The residents have alleged that a false FIR has been registered against the three which should be quashed.
The families of the three, along with villagers and the village Panchayat went to the District Administrative Complex to meet the Deputy Commissioner (DC) and Superintendent of Police (SP), but the two officers were not present in their offices.
The residents told reporters that the three boys have been "falsely implicated". They claimed that it was not a case of alleged molestation but a dispute over seats. The seats had been allotted to the three boys, they claimed.
The entire incident, recorded by a passenger on mobile phone, went viral both on television and social media. It showed the two girls using their hand and belt to thrash the molesters.
The parents of the two girls lodged an FIR with Haryana Police against the three youths stating that the molesters got down at Kansla village in Rohtak.
The victims in their complaint alleged that they were "teased" by some youths in a Haryana Roadways bus when they were going to their college on Friday.
When the victims objected, one of the accused started beating them up.

Kit Harington blames his face for lookingseriousBy: Press Trust of India | London |
Posted: December 1, 2014 5:28 pm
‘Game of Thrones’ star Kit Harington, who shot to global fame as Jon Snow in the epic TV fantasy, believes his face makes him look more serious than he is in real life.
“I’d get people coming up to me in the street and asking if I was OK. But this is my default. I laugh, I make jokes, I just happen to reside in this face,” Harington told GQ magazine while appearing on its cover.
The British actor, 27, said he loved the fantasy show but wished he did not have to talk about it all the time. “Game Of Thrones is my life, it’s my day job, I love it. But honestly, if there is a curse of Thrones, it’s a lifetime of having to talk about it,” he said.
Harington feels all the actors are narcissists. “They’re all narcissists. Every single one, I promise you. To have that verve, to get up and want to be watched. It comes from a place – either you were denied that attention as a child, or you were given lots of it and want more. Which is where I land.”

South Korea fishing ship sinks in Bering Sea; at least onedeadBy: Associated Press | Seoul |
Posted: December 1, 2014 5:26 pm
Rescuers searched Monday for 52 people missing after a South Korean fishing ship they were working on sank in the Bering Sea, an official said. At least one person died.
Authorities rescued seven crew members and recovered one body, but weather and water conditions were complicating the search for the others, the official, from the South Korean fisheries and oceans ministry, said on condition of anonymity because of office rules. The crew included 35 Indonesians, 13 Filipinos, 11 South Koreans and one Russian inspector.
The ministry official said it’s believed that the ship, which was catching pollock, began to list after stormy weather caused seawater to flood its storage areas. The official said the 2,100-ton ship was 35 years old. The South Korean foreign ministry said it asked Russian officials to work quickly to rescue the other crew members.
Kim Kang-ho from Sajo Industries, which owns the ship, said it left for the Bering Sea from a port in Busan, South Korea, on July 10. There are five South Korean-owned ships currently fishing in the Bering Sea to catch pollock, which is a winter delicacy in South Korea, Kim said.

Sun Pharma and Ranbaxy deal gets FIPB nodSun Pharma's Ranbaxy deal gets green signal from FIPB

(The combined entity would…)
NEW DELHI: The government has approved Sun Pharmaceuticals' acquisition of Ranbaxy Laboratories while the foreign investment promotion board (FIPB) has sent HDFC Bank's proposal for the further approval of the cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA).
"Based on the recommendations of Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) in its meeting held on November 14, 2014, the Central Government has approved 15 proposals of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) amounting to Rs 689.35 crore approximately," finance ministry said in a statement.
Sun Pharmaceuticals has in a $4 billion all-stock deal acquired Ranbaxy Laboratories earlier this year and sought FIPB nod for issuing equity shares to nonresident Indians in lieu of their holing in the latter.
Ranbaxy shareholders will receive 0.8 share of Sun Pharma for each share of Ranbaxy. There is no immediate foreign inflow on account of the deal.
The deal now requires the approval of the Competition Commission of India , which has suggested some remedial measures because of the dominance position enjoyed by the combination in some therapeutic segments.
This CCI approval with the proposed changes is expected over next few days. "Last week the competition commission had suggested some more changes to the structure which the companies had proposed" said a CCI official, adding that competition watchdog's order on the largest inbound deal in the pharma sector should be out over the next few days.
The remedial measures could involve asking the companies to divest some of their drug brands in select therapies where the Sun Ranbaxy combine will hold a dominant marketshare.
"We have neither received any final order from CCI on the transaction, nor has there been any rejection of the transaction by CCI. The competition commission has been seeking additional information and detailed clarifications with respect to specific aspects of the products for the purpose of making its assessment.
We see the process nearing its logical closure" said a Sun Pharma spokesperson.
The HDFC Bank's proposal has been sent to the CCEA for further approval as the potential implication is over Rs 1,200 crore, threshold above which all proposal have to receive need a further review.
"Approval has been sought by, M/s HDFC Bank Limited for maintaining the permissible foreign holding in the bank up to 74% of the total paid up capital, out of which the FII sub-limit would be 49% and the balance 25% would be FDI," the statement said.
HDFC Bank had sought government's permission to raise foreign investment limit from 49% to 67.55% but FIPB reasoned that counting the 22.56% stake held by HDFC, foreign investment was already near 74%, the sectoral limit. HDFC Bank subsequently moved an application seeking regularization of its existing foreign investment as it was over the approved limit.

TMC targets Amit Shah  alleges he is named in Sahara  red diaryComments
Trinamool Congress on Monday launched an offensive on the Bharatiya Janata Party in Parliament and held a rally in Kolkata to counter the saffron party president Amit Shah's criticism of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Sunday.
Facing heat over the Saradha scam, Trinamool targeted the BJP inside as well as outside Parliament by alleging that a diary of jailed Sahara group chief Subrata Roy contained the name of a senior leader of the saffron party, leading to clashes and a walkout.
Placard-wielding Trinamool MPs held a demonstration outside Parliament demanding a probe into alleged links between Shah and the Sahara money laundering case.
Trinamool sought to corner the ruling party in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha by displaying symbolic red diaries.
The Trinamool members alleged the diary was recovered from Sahara chief Subrata Roy by the Central Bureau of Investigation during searches at Sahara's office and claimed it contained the name of a BJP leader.
Attack in Parliament
In Lok Sabha, Trinamool MPs rushed to the Well shouting slogans, carrying red-coloured diaries which had "Sahara" written on it. They demanded that PM Modi should explain what action the CBI has taken after the name allegedly figured in the diary. They later staged a walkout.
Bandyopadhyay had given a notice for suspension of Question Hour to discuss the issue which was rejected by Speaker Sumitra Mahajan.
"They (Trinamool MPs) have decided not to follow the rules," she said.
Parliamentary affairs minister M Venkaiah Naidu said according to rules no member can name anyone who is not a member of the House. They also cannot display placards, he said.
To this, the Speaker said the name of the BJP leader would not go on record.
After protesting for a few minutes, the Trinamool MPs staged a walkout.
Minister of state for home affairs Kiren Rijiju, however, denied the presence of the "red diary".
"These are political allegations. There is no truth in it. No such diary was recovered," Rijiju told reporters in Delhi.
Later, BJP member Kirit Somaiya hit back, alleging that the Trinamool government in West Bengal was creating "hurdles" in the CBI investigation into the Saradha chit fund scam, in which names of "one dozen" Trinamool leaders have cropped up.
This led to protests by Trinamool members but Somaiya went on saying that 3.5 lakh small investors had been cheated in the chit fund scheme.
"The state government is not cooperating with the CBI probe," he alleged.
Amid noisy scenes, the Speaker adjourned the House for lunch, ahead of schedule.
In Rajya Sabha, Trinamool's Derek O'Brien sought to raise the issue during Zero Hour and Question Hour but was disallowed.
He had earlier given a notice for suspension of Question Hour but was not allowed.
As O'Brien rose to raise the issue during Question Hour, BJP members shouted him down by raising the issue of Saradha chit fund scam.
The members flashed symbolic red diaries with Sahara written on them, and tried to storm the well of the upper house as well to press their demand.
Trinamool members later staged a walkout as they were disallowed from raising the issue.
Counter-rally in Kolkata
Mamata Banerjee's nephew and Diamond Harbour Lok Sabha MP, Abhisekh Banerjee, said the West Bengal chief minister does not want to respond to Shah as she believes "he is not of her stature".
Mamata cancelled an appearance at the rally held by Abhishek to counter Shah's allegations levelled against her by Shah.
Speaking almost from the same spot where Shah delivered his Sunday speech, Abhisekh attacked the BJP and PM Modi saying he has done nothing for West Bengal after coming to power.
Abhisekh mocked Modi by comparing him with his aunt saying while he flies in private jets, goes abroad and changes wardrobe frequently, Mamata stays in a small house, wears handloom sarees and chappals.
Without naming Shah, he said those who come to Bengal like migratory birds, address a rally and return to Delhi will not win elections in the state.
Abhisekh also alleged Union minister of law and justice Sadanand Gowda's assets jumped from Rs. 9 crore to Rs. 20 crore in three months, and BJP must explain it.
Shah on Sunday had sounded the poll bugle to oust Trinamool from the state in the 2015 Kolkata Municipal Corporation and 2016 assembly elections and called for a Trinamool-free Bengal.
The BJP's rise in Bengal has sparked speculations about new equations in the state's political arena where the saffron brigade was only a fringe player until recently.
However, banking on Modi's poll promises on development, the party bagged an impressive 16.8% vote share in the April-May Lok Sabha elections. Even though the BJP won just two of the 42 seats, it made an impact.
Frequent clashes between BJP and Trinamool supporters have been reported in West Bengal since the polls.
The BJP chief's address came at a time when the ruling Trinamool is reeling under graft allegations in the multi-crore Saradha chit fund scam and the Burdwan blasts on October 2 that killed two alleged militants from Bangladesh.
Addressing the rally that saw a crowd of two lakh people, Shah had attacked Banerjee over the Saradha case, terrorist activities as well as lack of development in the state.
The TMC on Sunday had refused to attach much importance to Shah's rally and described it as a 'grand flop show'.
The city police, West Bengal fire department and the Kolkata Municipal Corporation had denied permission for the event at the Victoria House, where the ruling Trinamool usually organises its annual martyrs' day rally.
An intervention by the Calcutta high court saw the BJP getting the nod only at the eleventh hour.

Stop cow smuggling on Bangla border: Rajnath to BSFComments
BSF personnel should check the smuggling of cattle, especially cows, from India-Bangladesh border and clamp it down at any cost, home minister Rajnath Singh said on Monday.
A seasoned politician and organiser, Union home minister Rajnath Singh has one of the key responsibilities in the government - security of the country.
"You (BSF) have to work on many frontiers. You have to strive to stop illegal infiltration from Bangladesh, deal with narcotics,fake currency notes being smuggled from this border.
"I want to tell BSF jawans and officers that you should stop the smuggling of cows (at this border) at any cost and if you are doing that already I compliment you for that," the Home Minister said while delivering his speech during the 45th Raising Day celebrations of the force in New Delhi.
Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) Director General Maj Gen Aziz Ahmed was also among those attended the event. Cow is revered by the Hindus and the RSS and its affiliated associations have been vocal about the illegal transport of cows and other cattle across the border for slaughtering.
The 4,096km Indo-Bangla border is guarded by the Border Security Force, with BGB the counterpart on other side, and this frontier is notorious for smuggling of cattle, narcotics and fake Indian currency notes. The Home Minister also lauded the country's largest border guarding force, which also guards the Indo-Pak border, for giving a befitting reply to Pakistan during the recent spate of ceasefire violations. "You showed a lot of patience during these ceasefire violations despite Pakistan provoking and doing repeated violations.
It is because of your hardwork that no one can cast its evil eye on India. You have a glint of patriotism on your faces today," he said.
The home minister also sounded words of caution for neighbouring countries when reporters, on the sidelines of the event, asked him about the emergence of terror groups like ISIS and similar activities on the eastern flank related to Burdwan blasts. "A threat is threat.
I think even in our neighbouring countries anywhere when these terrorist organisations raise their heads then definitely all neighbouring countries should take precautions because no one can remain untouched (by their activities)," he said after the event at a BSF camp here. Singh added that the security mechanism of the country has devised "plans" to stop and check such terrorist activities and these measures were also discussed during the recently held conference of the top police brass of the country in Guwahati.
He said he cannot rule out further arrests in the ISIS terror case in which one Mumbai-based youth has been arrested recently by the NIA. Talking about the security of public rallies of BJP President Amit Shah in West Bengal, he said that it was the "responsibility of the state government to see that no untoward incident happens" during such events.

Protect credit score from dropping when shopping

Credit score

Mortgage-rate shopping for your best deal can be a contradiction. The more you shop, the better chance your FICO credit scores drop, effectively punishing you for trying to save money.
And, not only can you end up with a higher mortgage rate, but it may also mean the difference between loan approval and denial. "The difference of one point in a FICO score can cost thousands of dollars or even the difference between approval and denial," said Brad Seibel, executive vice president of Florida-based Planet Home Lending.
So how much is your FICO score affected each time you shop a mortgage rate?  "The range is usually two to seven points", said Geri Detweiler, director of consumer education at credit.com . She also said lenders' FICO scoring models vary widely in terms of how multiple inquiries count as one inquiry for a certain time period. She explained it could be all mortgage lender inquiries within 15, 30 or 45 days count as one. It just depends on the scoring model the lender is using.
To make your head spin a little more, Anthony Sprauve, senior consumer credit specialist at FICO.com , confirmed that there are 49 versions of credit-scoring software on the market.
There is no way for you to know which of the 49 versions your lender is using, or, if it's a more liberal scoring model. And you don't know if they count multiple mortgage inquiries over 15 days or 45 days.
Improved consumer protection for mortgage shoppers is on the mind of Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Ca. She said she will introduce the Fair Credit Reporting Improvement Act of 2015 to Congress in January.
Among other things, the legislation would encourage consumers to shop for the best terms and conditions when seeking to obtain a mortgage (and other types of credit), by treating multiple hard inquiries by a creditor as a single inquiry within a reasonable 120-day time period. "I'm optimistic. We're stepping outside the box", Waters said when asked about this legislation passing.
For almost all lenders, a credit score of 740 or higher is the top tier that gets you the best mortgage pricing. These risk-based adjustments are in 20-point increments. For example, the next tier down is 720-739. Think of a 720 as an A and 740 an A+.
For conventional loans, middle credit-score eligibility starts at 620. Rarely will a lender price under 620.
For FHA loans, you can qualify all the way down to a 500 middle FICO score.
Your chosen lender must use your middle FICO credit score or the lowest middle score involving multiple applicants as part of the mortgage pricing and approval process.
Sprauve recommends checking your credit six months to one year before a major purchase. "You are entitled to receive one free credit report from each of the three bureaus per year", said Sprauve. Go to www.annualcreditreport.com .  Credit scores are not included.
Bill Jacob of Fullerton, Ca, realized his credit card debt was hurting his score when he initially went mortgage shopping. He paid off a significant amount of credit card debt and then re-ran his scores. "My score went up by 100 points," he said.
It made a big difference on his refinance terms. Originally, he and his wife were looking at a 4.5% rate. After improving his score, he funded on a 3.5% rate. That 1 percentage point improvement in the interest rate saved them $455 per month on his $755,000 loan.
Protect yourself. Allow just one lender to run your three credit bureaus and scores. Lenders usually don't charge for this. When shopping, tell the other lenders what your middle score is and, if need be, send them a copy of the report you possess. Once you pick a lender, give permission for the chosen lender to run your credit. At most, you should have two inquiries.

Taking advantage of earlier and longer promotions this season, fewer shoppers were in stores or purchasing online over the holiday weekend compared with last year, a trend that's expected to continue into Cyber Monday.
The National Retail Federation expects about 127 million people to shop online Monday, down from about 131 million who planned to shop online last year on Cyber Monday.
NRF CEO Matthew Shay attributes the shift in shopping patterns to the fact that some consumers may feel better about the economy and are less frantic about chasing deals, combined with shoppers recognizing they can get online deals all season long.
Black Friday promotions started a week or more earlier in some cases this year and most major retailers offered Black Friday prices both in stores and online over the weekend. Cyber Monday will last multiple days  at retailers including Target, Walmart, Old Navy, Staples, J.C. Penney and Kohl's, all of which started offering deals over the weekend.
Black Friday: Green for retailers
The nature of 24/7 online shopping may be decreasing the need to head to stores for deals, some data show. Besides convenience and avoiding crowds, 77% of online shoppers over the holiday weekend said they went to the Web because they found better or comparable deals, according to data from Consumer Electronics Association.
For the remainder of the season, "every day is going to be Black Friday, every minute is going to be Cyber Monday," Shay says. "(Retailers) can't let up for an instant because of the competitive nature of what's happening out there."
IBM Smarter Commerce, which tracks online sales data for retailers, still expects Cyber Monday to be the peak online shopping day of the year. "Retailers are holding back some inventory and working on new promotions to (entice) consumers to continue to shop Monday and throughout the whole week," says Jay Henderson, director of IBM Smarter Commerce.
Online and mobile shopping soared over Thanksgiving and Black Friday and many retailers already broke online records when shoppers started spending on Thanksgiving.
Cyber Monday tips
Target said it experienced a more than a 40% increase in online orders and sales on Thanksgiving. Walmart had its highest three-day stretch ever of online traffic and orders  from Thanksgiving through Saturday. Overall, Smarter Commerce reported online sales on Thanksgiving were up 14.3% over last year, driven by significant mobile use: smartphones and tablets accounted for more than half of all online traffic Thursday.

That's likely to shift Monday when more people are expected to shop on desktops or laptops while at work, Henderson says.
Walmart hopes it will see more shoppers than last year on Cyber Monday, says Fernando Madeira, CEO of Walmart.com. Cyber Monday was its biggest online shopping day of the year in 2013. This year, it has doubled the number of deals that will be available online, and is offering exclusive promotions on items available for same-day pickup, as well as a round of evening-only deals aimed at people shopping after work.
"We believe we're well positioned to capture the traffic," Madeira says. "We expect more momentum."
Overall, fewer people shopped in stores and online over the holiday weekend, according to NRF. Traffic was down 5.2% from 2013 and total spending was expected to reach $50.9 billion by Sunday, down from $57.4 billion estimated for the same period last year.
"Shoppers have changed the way they view exclusive deals," Shay says. "They have this expectation that it's going to be there all the time."
An enormous crowd flooded into Macy's Herald Square Thursday night in what was likely a record shopping night for the store. CEO Terry Lundgren estimated more than 15,000 people showed up at the historic flagship store. VPC

Rupee Ends Flat at 62.02 After Hitting 9-1/2 Month LowMumbai: The rupee ended largely steady on Monday after touching a near 9-1/2 month low, as dollar selling by exporters helped offset the weakness seen due to lower Asian currencies and global growth concerns.
Sentiment also remained cautious ahead of the Reserve Bank of India monetary policy review on Tuesday.
All emerging Asian currencies hit new lows on a day when Moody's downgraded Japan's sovereign credit rating stating "heightened uncertainty over the achievability of fiscal deficit reduction goals".
Meanwhile, the dollar continued to be boosted by oil's longest losing streak since the 2008 financial crisis. On Monday, oil prices extended from last week their steep sell-off after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) decided not to cut production, keeping markets well supplied.
"Asian units are reacting to the commodity deflation feeding into the strong dollar trend, apart from the fact that global growth is going down the tube," said Anindya Banerjee, a currency analyst at Kotak Securities in Mumbai.
Traders are now bracing up for the apex bank's policy review amid rising expectation of a cut in policy rates despite most analysts in a Reuters poll expecting the central bank to maintain status quo.
The partially convertible rupee closed at 62.02/03 per dollar versus 62.0250/0350 on Friday. It hit a low of 62.25 intraday - its weakest since February 20.
Traders said dollar sales by exporters and custodian banks helped the rupee recover from session lows.
In the offshore non-deliverable forwards market, the one-month contract was at 62.36, while the three-month was at 62.87.

Malayalam’s first ‘perfect’ comedian
SAJU CHELANGAD
Malayalam cinema
The drama Mishiha Charithram was nearing its climax. The venue was a temporary stage at Ettumanoor town. The scene was that of the famous Last Supper. Jesus Christ was speaking to his disciples where he forecasts how He was going to be betrayed by one of his own men. The scene very dramatically presents Christ not making a specific disclosure putting all his disciples under a cloud. The disciples glance at each other and each one ask Christ if he was referring to him. The audience watch with bated breath for Christ to speak. Suspense was building up and you hear a pin drop in the silence. All on a sudden a young man stood up on a bench and shouted out, “Is the disciple S. Pankan Pillai?” For a split second the audience did not know how to react. Then they rushed towards the young man, some of them managing to land a couple of blows on his shoulder. The young man ran for his life with a group in hot pursuit.
That young man was Pankan Pillai and the people of Ettumanoor knew him well. He was an announcer at the private bus stand whose job was to inform the arrival and departure of buses. A couple of months later another drama troupe arrived at Ettumanoor. One of their actors, who played a comedian, was not available for a show. Pankan Pillai, who came to know of this, approached the troupe and requested them to give him a chance. Though they were reluctant at first they finally surrendered to his appeals.
Pankan played that role very well and was rewarded five rupees. He went on to travel with the troupe as a permanent member. He must have appeared as comedian on more than 1,000 stages. And soon he was rechristened S.P. Pillai.
He enrolled himself at Kerala Kalamandalam to study Kathakali. Soon he became on of Vallathol’s close aides. It was during this time that S.P. Pillai came to know that Appan Thampuran, a member of Cochin Royal Family based at Trichur, was planning to make a film titled Bhootharayar. Pillai went there and met Appan Thampuran. Pillai was asked to have a screen test which he did. Appan Thampuran was impressed with his acting and the manner in which he rendered his dialogues. Pillai was promised a role in the film but unfortunately this film did not take off. Pillai discontinued his Kathakali studies and went back to theatre.
Years later Pillai got his first film - Nalla Thanka, produced by K&K Films. This was the turning point in Pillai’s life and also for Malayalam cinema. Comedy in Malayalam cinema was then very raw and dependent on comic gestures, which had become boring. Pillai introduced a new style to comedy. He was Malayalam’s first perfect comedian.
The noted writer Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai called Pillai, Kerala Chaplin. And he had reason to call him so. Pillai, like Chaplin, had a tough childhood; an unhappy past.
Born in Muttom village, near Harippad, Pankan Pillai lost his father, who was a police constable, at an early age. Soon, he lost his mother too. Pankan was brought up by his grandmother. When she died Pankan was forced to discontinue his studies and left the village. He wandered around, took up various jobs before reaching Ettumanoor. For many days Pankan spent the nights at the famous Ettumanoor temple there, worked in the hotels and shops there on daily wages. The free food from the temple was a boon for him. This went on till he landed the job of an announcer at the private bus stand.
In later years Pillai became an integral part of Malayalam cinema. He reigned supreme as a comic actor os incredible variety and range. His roles in films like Nayaru Pidicha Pulivaal, Karutha Kai, Kannum Karallum, Odayilninnu, Chemmeen, Kumarasambhavam, Kaithappoo, Aromalunni etc. will be etched in the minds of film buffs forever. S.P. Pillai acted in more than 200 films and won the Kerala State award for second best actor in 1977 for his role in Taxi Driver. He built a house in Ettumanoor, the town that made him, settled here till his death in 1985.

Oct core sector output growth jumps to 6.3%October infrastructure output jumps to four-month high of 6.3 per cent
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: December 1, 2014  | 20:00 IST

The growth rate of eight of core industries rose to a four-month-high of 6.3 per cent in October on the back of better output in coal, refinery products and electricity, a positive news ahead of the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) monetary policy review on Tuesday.
The eight core industries - coal, crude oil, natural gas, refinery products, fertiliser, steel, cement and electricity - had shrunk by 0.1 per cent in October 2013, while the growth rate was 1.9 per cent in September 2014.
Production in coal, refinery products and electricity registered a growth of 16.2 per cent, 4.2 per cent and 13.2 per cent, respectively in October, as per the data released by the Commerce and Industry Ministry.
Growth in coal and refinery products had declined by 3.5 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively in October 2013 while growth in power generation was only 1.3 per cent.
Expansion in crude oil and steel production was 1 per cent and 2.3 per cent respectively in October. The growth in the two sectors was slower than the previous month.
The core sector contributes 38 per cent in the overall industrial production, a parameter that RBI takes into account while framing its monetary policy.
The central bank is expected to hold interest rate at 8 per cent in its fifth bi-monthly monetary policy review on Tuesday despite the industry's demand for a rate cut to push the economic growth, which has slowed to 5.3 per cent in September quarter from 5.7 per cent in the June-quarter of the 2014-15 financial year.
During April-October, the eight sectors grew by 4.3 per cent as against 4.2 per cent in the corresponding year-ago period.

CPI (M)-led Opposition attacks Finance Minister Mani on bribeallegationsWritten by Shaju Philip | Thiruvananthapuram |
Posted: December 1, 2014 7:06 pm
CPI (M)-led Opposition on Monday launched a three-pronged agitation against Kerala Finance Minister K M Mani, who is facing allegations of accepting a bribe to facilitate renewal of liquor licence of bar hotel owners.
The state assembly had a stormy start with the Opposition members walking out of the Assembly demanding that Mani, chairman of regional party Kerala Congress (M), should quit. The members disrupted the question hour in the morning raising the charges against Mani. They came to the assembly with placards demanding that a case should be registered against Mani.
Deputy Opposition leader Kodiyeri Balakrishnan alleged that bar hotel owner Biju Ramesh’s driver and two others had gone to Mani’s home to deliver the bribe to the minister. He sought examination of the phone call details of bar hotel owners and government chief whip P C George. As an evidence to substantiate the charges, Balakrishnan wanted to present the CD containing the discussions at the bar hotel owners meeting in Kochi. However, the Speaker denied permission for the same.
Mani said neither he nor his party had accepted bribe from any person. The liquor policy, which envisaged closure of bar below five-star category, was a collective decision of the cabinet. Home Minister Ramesh Chennithala informed the assembly that the vigilance probe was on and the report would be submitted in the high court.
While Opposition raised the storm in the assembly, the CPI (M) youth outfit DYFI took out a march to the state secretariat demanding Mani’s resignation. CPI (M) state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan said UDF ministers were engaged in a mutual back scratching in corruption. Going by the parliamentary precedents, Mani should quit and face investigation.
On Monday, LDF convener Vaikkom Vishwan moved a petition in the high court demanding that the Vigilance be directed to register a case against Mani based on the revelation of the bar hotel owner that he paid a bribe of Rs 1 crore to the minister. The petition, which would be considered by the division bench of the court, said the minister should be kept away from the position during the investigation.

Bigg Boss 8: Pritam nominates Puneet Issar; does P3G endhereBy: Entertainment Feature Service | New Delhi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 7:06 pm
As the day begins, Praneet and Pritam are seen preparing for their captaincy task. Both are required to go on a campaigning spree convincing all the members of the house one at a time as to why they should vote for them. Housemates then vote for their respective choice through a ballot box election procedure. Pritam who is already immune from last week’s immunity task was keen on making Praneet the captain until yesterday. However after the announcement of the task Pritam has a change of heart and wants to play a fair game.
As the day progresses Diandra and Gautam continue their romance while other housemates are seen strategizing and plotting against each other every now and then. While the day continues the housemates become anxious as the time for the nominations procedure comes near.
Bigg Boss summons Pritam into the confession room launching the nominations procedure and asks him to give five names he thinks should be nominated this week. The given names will then be directly nominated for the week. As an interesting twist, Bigg Boss lets housemates watch what Pritam has to say through Me TV. Housemates are left dumbstruck and confused when Pritam is seen nominating Puneet. Gautam is also taken aback while Puneet tries to calm himself down.
Pritam states that people feel he is influenced by Puneet Ji and that is why he nominating Puneet and putting an end to this thought. When Pritam comes out of the confession room Upen tells him that it was all shown to the housemates. Pritam states that what he has done is right. Gautam feels that Pritam has betrayed P3G. Praneet tries to understand Pritam’s point of view but Puneet seems to be in no mood for any kind of explanation.
All the other housemates keep mum about Pritam’s revelations but some are surely seen being very happy about it. This start of the brand new week in the house is surely an intriguing one as one will see friendships and relations being tested to the core. Who will pass and who will fail? Will have to wait and watch.

What India searched the most in 2014: Narendra Modi  ISIS  Sunny Leone  Drama Queen HolidayBy: Tech Desk | New Delhi |

Bing has revealed top search trends for 2014, the search engine annual look-back at what information people are searching for the most on the Internet.
Not surprisingly, movies, music, sports, celebrities, politics, and news emerge as the most popular searches among Indian netizens.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the most sought-after political leader, ahead of Jayalalithaa, Smriti Irani, and even Jawaharlal Nehru, the country’s first prime minister.
Despite retiring, Sourav Ganguly continues his reign at the top as the most popular sportsperson on the Net while Sunny Leone tops the celebrity list, fighting off challenge from Katrina Kaif and Deepika Padukone.

Axar Patel  Suryakumar Yadav lead West fightback to beat South Zone in Deodhar Trophysemi-finalPosted: December 1, 2014 6:57 pm

winning hit – a straight six. (Source: PTI file)
Riding on belligerent half centuries from Suryakumar Yadav and Axar Patel, defending champions West Zone staged a magnificent fight back to edge past South Zone by 2 wickets and enter the Deodhar Trophy tournament final, in Mumbai on Monday.
Chasing an imposing 315 for victory in the second semi-final, West were struggling at 174 for six when Yadav (80
in 56 balls with 4 sixes, 7 fours) and No.8 batsman Patel (64 not out in 38 balls) got involved in a match-winning stand of 70 runs off 76 balls.
The seventh-wicket duo added a whopping 67 runs in the batting power play that turned the side’s fortunes.
Though Yadav, dropped twice on 9 and 11, departed at the score reading 244, left handed Patel – who struck 4 sixes and 5 fours in his 38-ball essay – found an able partner in Shardul Thakur (31 not out in 23 balls) to take West to 319
for eight in 47.1 overs.
Fittingly, the Gujarat youngster, who has made a good impression in the series against Sri Lanka recently, hit the
winning hit – a straight six – to complete a memorable win at the Wankhede Stadium.
Top-order batsmen Sheldon Jackson (51) and Ambati Rayudu (54) had put on 89 runs in 91 balls for the second wicket but following their dismissals in quick succession, the hosts fell into trouble before Yadav and Patel bailed them out.
West, bidding for their fourth straight title, will meet East Zone in the final here on December 3 in a day-night clash.
Earlier, South’s top-order feasted on some wayward bowling after being put in to bat by West and they piled on 314 for six.
Half-centuries from Mayank Agarwal, Baba Aparajith, Manish Pandey and a well-made 47 by opener Robin Uthappa
contributed in the imposing total.
In the morning, South got off to a rollicking start on the placid track with openers Agarwal and Uthappa taking a heavy toll of some poorly directed bowling from West medium pacers Dhawal Kulkarni and Thakur to put on a stand of 104 and lay a solid platform.
Agarwal top-scored with a stroke-filled 86 off 87 balls with ten fours, first-match centurion Aparajith made 56 off 64 balls and Pandey smashed his way to 55 off 50 balls.
The two openers, with Agarwal being the more aggressive batsman, added 37 in the first five overs before Domnic
Muthuswami brought things under control with a tight first spell, aided at the other end by Patel’s tight left-arm spin.
Another fruitful stand of 76 runs in 74 balls followed between Agarwal and Aparajith, scorer of a century in the
quarter final win over Central, as the 150 came up in the 26th over.
Off-spinner Deepak Hooda had Agarwal, who was poised for his century, stumped with a wide ball down the leg side after the batsman had scored at almost a run-a-ball and struck ten fours.
A short ball from Kulkarni in his continued…

Jain monks Diksha program inSuratBy: Express News Service | Surat |
Posted: December 1, 2014 6:44 pm
Fortyfive Jains aged 12 to 59 years renounced their worldly lives to become monks at a ceremony in Ichchanath area of Surat on Monday. Of these 30 were women, and the rest were men.
The event organised by the Samyam Suvas Parivar which claimed this was the biggest initiation in 522 years, the last one being in Palitana where 38 had taken diksha.
The celebration lasted three days culminating on Monday where the children, men and women dressed up in all their finery, the women with henna on their hands and wearing sarees and the men in sherwanis, rode chariots driven by horses and camels, and some riding elephants through the streets showering gold and silver and currency notes, apart from clothes and household items.
Gujarat chief minister Anandiben Patel was to attend the event, but she was down with viral fever.
Of the 45 who attained sainthood, the youngest is 12 year old boy and 14-year old girl while the eldest is 59 year old male. Of the 30 females, 17 are from Surat, followed by 10 from Mumbai and five from Ahmedabad and remaining ones from others places from Navsari, Navsari, Halol, Kolkata, etc.
Over thousands of Jain community people from Surat and different parts of state and other states remained present in the pandal in Surat at Ichhanath.
On Monday morning, the 45 of them bathed for the last time and met their family members for the last time as their children. Accompanied by friends they entered the pandal in presence of thousands of Jains and took blessings from the priests. Following the bath, they were tonsured and shaved came out donning the white robes and assumed new names after the ritual.
The event coordinator team member Sanjay Vora said, “We all witnessed the historical event today which had happened after 500 years, wherein all together 45 people had embraced diksha and went from the worldly life to a spiritual one. These monks will now onwards never use worldly items and even will not stay at their homes. They have donated their life to the Maharajsaheb and work to spread jain religion across the country. These people will never ride motor vehicles and never bath till their last breath. They will also eat in simple wooden dishes. They can meet their parents and brothers and sister but they will not touch them. Their lives have changed.”

Varun Dhawan: From a Student to a dad in BadlapurWritten by Sonal Gera | New Delhi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 6:40 pm | Updated: December 1, 2014 6:45 pm
The ‘Student’ has now graduated and matured into an adult and is all ready to take risks in life. And rightly so, a movie like ‘Badlapur’ in such an early phase of his life was no less than a risk for Varun Dhawan especially when there were people discouraging him to take up the project. “You’ll be over,” they said, while others rued that one of his biggest fanbases – the children – might be lost. But he signed the second movie he got right after ‘Student of the Year’ nevertheless.
In an interview to Mumbai Mirror , Varun recalls how terrified he was when Sriram Raghavan, the director of the movie, narrated to him the whole script. The only question he asked the director was, “Why me?” Sriram retorted, “Because you have innocent eyes, something my character needs.” And he signed the movie.
“I can’t go into the specifics, but my character in the revenge drama is a guy working in an ad agency who starts a family. You will see me as a father on the screen for the first time,” Varun adds. He also revealed how he ages from an 18 year old to a 40 year old in the movie and that he will be for the first time shown playing a father in a movie.
But the experince of shooting ‘Badlapur’ wasn’t all that hunky dory for him as he lost quite a few friends in the process, because he was looking at life from a different perspective of a wronged man. “It drained me. I had slipped into depression as after a point it no longer felt like I was acting in a film. The experience was that terrifying,” Varun admits.
But we guess, the result of it all is surely a winner as the posters of the movie look promising. The first poster had a rough, fierce and fiery Varun and he quite nailed the look.

The second released poster of the movie shows Varun and Nawazuddin Siddiqui across the battle line.
The revenge drama, which also features Huma Qureshi and Yami Gautam, does look promising with Varun Dhawan taking up a new avatar. It remains to be seen how it and Varun fare at the Box Office.

AP will have Japan s imprint on developments | Port projects on fast track in MahaChandrababu Naidu wants Andhra Pradesh to shine with help from 'land of rising sun'

Andhra Pradesh
(Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe…)
HYDERABAD: Andhra Pradesh will have Japan's imprint on development in various spheres, particularly in building the state's new capital, if plans drawn out by the TDP-led Government fructify.
Not only Japan's top companies and organisations but also the its government has agreed to "work with us" and aid in development of the "sunrise state", Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu said today and expressed satisfaction over his five-day successful trip to Asian economic powerhouse last week.
Naidu is promoting Andhra Pradesh as a "sunrise state" given its location in the east-coast zone.
Briefing mediapersons about the outcome of his second foreign visit after taking over as the Chief Minister of the truncated State, Naidu said the main purpose of his trip was to make preparation for long-term development plans for AP.
"I am preparing long-term plans for the State and not looking at instant gains. Japan Government has promised support and its participation in our State's development while major Japanese companies and organisations have also agreed to chip in with investments and other assistance," he said.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was "very positive" after knowing the state's development plans, the Chief Minister said, adding, "I have requested Abe to visit Andhra Pradesh when he tours India next year and he has agreed."
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), he said, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the AP Government to promote direct investment by companies from Asia's second largest economy into Andhra Pradesh in urban development, infrastructure, manufacturing, agriculture, food processing and information technology.
METI would also support development of industrial parks in AP, he added. Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has come forward to prepare a project report on the industrial potential in AP and promote investments.
"We are in the third place now in Japanese investment but we want to make it No 1. Already three Japanese companies are investing in the Sri City SEZ in Chittoor district and more are expected to come," the Chief Minister said.
SoftBank, a major business group of Japan, has evinced interest in setting up 10,000 MW of solar power plants in AP.
"SoftBank Chairman and CEO Masayoshi Son is currently doing some research to make the solar power project cost- effective and efficient so that the per unit cost could be brought down to Rs 4 from the current Rs 6.5," he said.

Experts have already begun to mention the chance that the average price for a gallon of regular gasoline will drop below $2 in some parts of America. There are several states where this is highly likely. As a matter of fact, the prices in these states could drop below $2 as early as the start of next year.
Most of the states likely to post lower than $2 gas have three things in common: the general drop in oil prices, proximity to large refineries and low state gas taxes.
The first among these has already begun to have an outsized influence. Oil has fallen below $66. Just five days ago, the price was nearly $80. In late June, it was close to $100. If oil stays below $70, it could knock $0.20 to $0.30 off the average price of a regular gallon of gas nationwide by itself, if the evidence of the past month as an indication. Over that period, the price of gas nationwide has dropped from $3.03 to $2.79, according to GasBuddy.
The eight states were gas prices are likely to fall below $2 are Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Missouri and Tennessee.
Several of these are either on the Gulf of Mexico or states adjacent to ones that are. Each already has gas prices below $2.60. In all but one, the price has continued to fall over the past several days.
Mississippi, Alabama, Texas and Louisiana are directly on the Gulf of Mexico and close to the large refineries in Texas, which, taken together, are among the biggest block of refineries in the world. Oklahoma and Tennessee border at least one of these four states. So, each has the advantage that among the variable costs of gasoline is the distance it must travel from refineries to retailers.
ALSO READ: 9 Cities Where Gas Will Drop Below $2
Finally, state gas tax rates have a profound effect on total gas prices. An illustration of this is that the state with the third highest gas tax is New York, where it is $0.50. New York also has the third highest gas price in the United States at $3.18. The two states where gas prices are higher — Alaska and Hawaii — are distant from supply.
According to the Tax Foundation, last year, South Carolina had the 47th highest gas tax among all states at $0.168. Oklahoma was 46th at $0.170. Missouri was 45th at $0.173. Mississippi was 44th at $0.188. Louisiana was 38th at $0.20
Gas prices in eight states should be below $2 within a few months.

Contront that know-it-allWho can keep us hack-free?
A: You’re the one caught in the middle here. You were hired to do a job, and you’re figuring out how to do it by drawing on your previous experiences, your training, feedback you’ve received from others above and below you, and your knowledge of the industry. While you are expected to incorporate all these streams of data into your job performance, it’s not within your abilities to know everything, especially about events that occurred at your firm long before you started.
It’s also not fair, or productive, for a higher-up to suppress your opinions at work just because he’s been there longer. In fact, a major reason companies hire from outside, instead of always promoting from within, is to bring in new ideas. If this manager succeeds in holding your organisation to the strictures of yesteryear, he’s likely doing you all a disservice.
“This is, first of all, a problem for your supervisor, since his or her leadership of your group is being undermined by the officious senior manager’s meddling,” said Dana Radcliffe, the Day Family Senior Lecturer of Business Ethics at the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University, in Ithaca, New York. 
Your boss needs to sit down with this manager, or the manager’s superiors, and decide who’s in charge of what. It’s not this manager’s job, presumably, to tell everyone in the office what to do. There are chains of command for a reason.
Don’t confront the manager yourself, Radcliffe advised in an email to Work Ethic: “Rather, you should have a low-key but serious chat with your supervisor, diplomatically expressing your confusion about the lines of authority.”  Frame the conversation as an attempt to understand what your supervisor expects you do to when a manager from outside of your group starts giving you orders.
It’s quite possible that the meddling manager has some valuable points to add about how the company is deviating from best practices or from procedures that were long ago established for a good reason. But he’s doing it the wrong way.
“Whatever he has to offer these other groups isn’t being channelled effectively, a fact he seems not to recognize,” Radcliffe said. So it’s up to his peers, like your boss, to help channel his feedback so that it doesn’t get in everyone’s way.
While you're waiting for your boss to address the issue with higher-ups, consider how you can present ideas so that the meddling manager doesn't shoot them down immediately. Perhaps portraying your suggestions as rooted in company history will work. You may not want to call attention to how innovative or disruptive your plans are. 
What if the problem is that your know-it all manager is strong-arming people into making the wrong decisions, based on his own faulty understanding of what was done before or what the competitive situation is today? Then you have a bigger problem, Radcliffe says: "Not only is he encroaching on other managers’ ‘territory,’ but his ill-informed ‘guidance’ may be interfering with the other groups’ operations." That makes it even more crucial that your boss get involved.
If your boss isn't up to the task of getting this manager to simmer down, you may be stuck tiptoeing around for a while — or even approaching a higher-level executive who can fix the situation by neutralizing the meddler.

Post your opinion here
 
Owners of operational coal blocks, which were cancelled by the Supreme Court, will have to shell out nearly Rs 10,500 crore as additional levy, Parliament was informed today.
"As regards financial implication of the judgement on the coal sector, the total amount of additional levy payable by the allocatees of producing coal blocks for the coal produced/ likely to be produced up to March, 2015 is estimated at Rs 10,494.36 crore," Coal Minister Piyush Goyal said in written reply to the Rajya Sabha.
The Supreme Court had in September declared allocations of all coal blocks made through the Screening Committee and through government dispensation route since 1993 as illegal and arbitrary. Of the 218 blocks, it had cancelled allocation of 204.
In case of 42 coal blocks (37 producing and five likely to come under production), cancellation shall take effect from March 31, 2015. The Court has also imposed an additional levy of Rs 295 per tonne on the total coal extracted since the commencement of the production from the coal mine to be deposited with the government.
The minister further that 325.507 million tonnes (Provisional) of coal has been mined from 37 producing coal mines (which have been cancelled) since the commencement of production till October, 2014.
As the apex Court has allowed coal production from the producing coal blocks till March 31, 2015 there is no disruption in production of coal at present, he added.
For management and reallocation of the cancelled coal blocks, government has promulgated 'The Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Ordinance', on October 21 to ensure smooth transfer of rights, tiles and interest in mines along with its land other associated mining infrastructure to the new allottees to be selected through an auction or allotment to government company, as the case may be.

Mukherjee gave his assent to the Bill on Saturday, says a notification issued by the government.
As per the DSPE (Amendment) Act, 2014, the leader of single largest opposition party in Lok Sabha can be included, when no Leader of Opposition (LoP) is recognised, in the panel to recommend the name for the CBI chief.
This means that Congress, which has been demanding the LoP status for its leader, will have a role to play in the selection process for CBI Director.
"No appointment of a Director shall be invalid merely by reason of any vacancy or absence of a member in the committee," the Act said.
The enactment of the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act (also known as Lokpal Act) in 2014 has amended the DSPE Act, which governs the functioning of the CBI.
Under the existing provisions, the CBI chief has to be appointed by the central government on the basis of recommendation of the selection committee headed by the Prime Minister, and comprising the LoP and the Chief Justice of India or a Supreme Court judge nominated by him, as members.
Earlier, a committee headed by Central Vigilance Commissioner used to recommend names for CBI Director.
The amendments in the DSPE Act are being brought in by the government as there is no recognised LoP in the Lok Sabha. Congress with 44 seats in the 543-member Lok Sabha has emerged as the second largest party after BJP's 280 but fell short by 11 to stake claim for the LoP's post for which it requires a minimum strength of 55.

An Anxious Cyber Monday for Retailers After Thanksgiving Sales BustAn Anxious Cyber Monday for Retailers After Thanksgiving Sales Bust
 
Morning Money Memo:
The biggest shopping weekend of the year was a bust for some retailers. Early discounting and more online shopping may have put a big dent Black Friday shopping. “Overall shopper traffic from Thanksgiving Day through Sunday dropped 5.2 percent from 2013,” the National Retail Federation said in a statement. Total spending in stores and online is expected to have declined by about 11 percent. Such early numbers suggest that many retailers may be disappointed by the holiday shopping season. “It’s going to be a dogfight for the entire season, every day, every minute,” federation CEO Matthew Shay told The New York Times. “Holiday sales are now a marathon, not a sprint.”
Black Friday promotions at Walmart and other big stores started weeks ago. Cyber Monday deals at Target, J.C. Penney, Staples and Old Navy also have been stretched out. Despite concerns about holiday sales, some brick-and-mortar retailers are reporting a strong increase in online sales. And TV sales are a bright spot with strong demand for the latest ultra  high-def (4K) sets.
Tens of millions of Americans are expected to log on and go shopping today. Since 2010 Cyber Monday has been the busiest online shopping day of the year. Amazon has some of the deepest discounts. “There is anecdotal evidence the discounts Amazon is offering are extraordinary,” 24/7wallst.com says.
Oil prices fell further on global markets, following last week’s decision by OPEC to maintain production levels despite weaker global demand. The price of West Texas crude plunged 10 percent on Friday to well under $70 a barrel for the first time since 2010. Wholesale oil prices have plunged nearly 40 percent since June. While consumers benefit from lower home heating and gasoline prices, OPEC’s stand is a blow to some high-cost U.S. producers that could become unprofitable and go out of business if oil prices stay this low.

Former New York governor Mario Cuomo, 82, has been hospitalized with a heart condition, reportedly spending the Thanksgiving holiday with family at his bedside.
The three-term Democratic governor's hospitalization was first reported over the weekend. The office of current New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), who is Mario Cuomo's son, on Saturday confirmed the report to the Associated Press.
It is unclear when Mario Cuomo was first checked into the hospital but the family has indicated he is in stable condition.
"He is in good spirits and thanks everyone for their support and best wishes," the current governor's office said in a statement. "We will provide updates as appropriate."
Chris Cuomo, a CNN anchor and also the governor’s son, mentioned the hospitalization on-air Monday morning and on social media Sunday.
My pop is Mario Cuomo (also my son!) Pop is in the hospital, and he is doing well enough. Thx for all the sweet sentiments. Appreciated. — Chris Cuomo (@ChrisCuomo) November 30, 2014

A realistic approach to linking carbon marketsComments
By Jessica F. Green December 1
Will the landmark climate agreement between the U.S. and China reached in November spur progress towards a global deal in Lima? (Feng Li, Getty)
Three weeks ago, the U.S. and China announced a landmark bilateral agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions.  Secretary of State John Kerry heralded the agreement as a key step toward reinvigorating international negotiations on climate change.
His theory will be tested this week, when diplomats will converge on Lima, Peru to negotiate the next steps of the climate change regime.  Although there is some optimism , the prospects remains highly uncertain.  The Kyoto Protocol expired in 2012, and so far, only a handful of countries have renewed their commitments, comprising only 12 percent of global emissions .  Countries have set themselves a deadline of December 2015 to agree to Kyoto’s successor, but agreement appears a long way off .  For starters, countries have not yet decided upon what the legal form of such an agreement would be, let alone agreed upon substantive commitments.
At the same time, states are developing national responses to climate change.  Increasingly, these include carbon markets.  The World Bank states that there are currently 18 active emissions trading schemes, functioning at the regional, national and sub-national levels, and 11 more are in the pipeline.  The conventional wisdom suggests that climate change is a collective action problem, where states will only act jointly for fear of others free-riding.  The explosive growth in domestic markets suggests that this is no longer a rigid constraint on action.
The relative gridlock at the international level, coupled with the patchwork of national and sub-national carbon markets, has prompted many to suggest that a bottom-up approach to international climate policy might be a potential solution.  Individual markets could link together, creating an ever-larger set of jurisdictions that price carbon, ideally culminating in a global carbon market.  Such an approach has the advantage of allowing states to set their own targets, consistent with domestic constraints, rather than subjecting them to international negotiation.
Economic theory dictates that linkage should lower the overall costs of reducing carbon emissions.  Linked carbon markets will allow money to flow to those investments where marginal costs of emissions reduction are lowest—providing the most bang for the buck.  In all likelihood, this would facilitate the movement of capital from the developed to the developing world, where costs of emissions reductions are generally lower.  Although the benefits of such an approach would be unevenly distributed (and more on that below), the overall costs of reduction would fall.
Accordingly, optimists suggest that linking carbon markets will be a “key element of emerging international climate policy architecture.”   If one adds in the possibility of linkage with the additional dozen jurisdictions that have implemented carbon taxes, the prospects for a global market are even more robust.
If only it were that easy.  I argue in a new article  in the journal Nature Climate Change that successful linkage—which reduces net long-term greenhouse gas emissions—may be more elusive than it seems ( the article is co-authored with Thomas Sterner and Gernot Wagner ) .
At the domestic level, states must resist the temptation to change policy in the face of rising costs.  Cap-and-trade markets are built around a cap: the amount of allowable emissions, which determines the level of reductions, and therefore, the ambition of the policy.  Once linked, the total number of allowances grows, but so too do the number of regulated entities.  Whether this raises or lowers the prices will depend on the cap set in each jurisdiction.  Countries must fight the temptation to hedge against future costs by setting overly generous caps.  These will drive down the price of individual allowances, but also lower the level of ambition of the policy.  Second, they must also avoid raising caps mid-stream.  If country A has a generous (i.e. unambitious) cap and links to country B with a stringent one, then prices for country A may well rise, since allowances become relatively more scarce.  One logical response would be for country A to raise its cap, thus increasing the overall number of allowances and lowering prices.  This would not only lower the efficacy of the policy, but would deflate the value of allowances throughout all linked markets, interfering with the ability of the markets to send credible price signals.
While linkage may provide a cost-effective way to reduce emissions, there will undoubtedly be winners and losers within each market.  Large emitters may benefit if the cost of compliance declines.  But smaller emitters, who may have allowances to sell, will see less demand for their product, and may object to the prospect of lost revenue.   The same logic holds across states, where net sellers will face increased competition.
Since countries inevitably have multiple policy goals, linkage faces yet another domestic obstacle: it must be compatible with these other objectives.  Linkage is premised on the assumption that states want to lower the cost of reducing emissions.  For some, cheaper allowance prices may not further other policy goals, such as transitions away from fossil fuels.   Conversely, some may wish to pursue linkage irrespective of its effects on prices.  For example, California and Quebec have recently linked their nascent carbon markets.  Given that abatement costs are roughly similar in these two jurisdictions, the economic benefits are likely to be small.  However, both have clearly indicated their desire to be policy leaders in the linkage approach.  Each appears more interested in demonstrating the feasibility of linkage than reaping its economic benefits.
The politics of linkage become even thornier when considering the international effects.  Linked jurisdictions must accept the reduced regulatory autonomy that accompanies open markets.  This is not terribly problematic if A and B jointly decide to link on agreed-upon terms.  However, if A subsequently decides to link to C, B is now indirectly linked – through terms it did not explicitly approve.  In addition to diminishing autonomy, indirect links could also compromise the integrity of the system, if regulatory systems are weak in any one of the three markets.  After all, carbon markets are premised on the assumption that states have both the regulatory capacity and the political will to enforce property rights; the same is true for linkage.  If any state within the system lacks these capabilities, there are additional risks of inundating the market with cheap allowances that do not represent meaningful reductions.   This will have repercussions throughout all linked jurisdictions.
Finally, linkage may be the victim of its own economic success.  Cost-effective linkage will result in large transfers of money from North to South, lowering the cost of compliance for the developed world, and promoting investment in the developing world.  However, as these transfers grow in size, it is likely that political objections will too.  The Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol serves as a cautionary tale.  At one point, the majority of investments originated in the European Union (EU) to support industrial gas projects in China.  Least developed countries, which were in the greatest need of investment, received a fraction of the total financial flows.  The EU has since changed its rules to redirect funds to underserved regions.  While this promotes one set of EU policy goals, it undermines the economic effectiveness of linkage.
How linkage can work
Carbon markets are now big business, estimated at almost $50 billion this year .
They provide a promising avenue for moving beyond the gridlock that has beset the Kyoto negotiations.  They are not going away.
So the question remains: how can linkage promote effective action on climate change – i.e. real and meaningful emissions reductions?  We advise that linking markets proceed with caution.  They must balance the benefits of economic efficiency with political feasibility.  Specifically, we have five suggestions for an incremental approach to linkage.
1)     Linking states should start small. Informal linkages through memoranda of understanding will promote learning and provide flexibility to work out any unanticipated problems.  It will also allow a test-run to ensure that domestic regulatory institutions are up to the task.  Once a pilot phase is successful, relationships can be further institutionalized through law.
2)     Linkage should start in the developed world.  This is so for several reasons.  First, the most mature markets—including, among others, the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative—are located in the developed world.  Quite simply, they have the most experience with cap-and-trade markets.  Second, and related, these are most likely to have robust regulatory capacity to support and enforce a trading system.  Finally, there will be smaller differences in marginal costs of abatement between developed nations.  While this will sacrifice some of the efficiency gains, it may also mitigate political objections associated with large transfers of wealth.
3)     Indirect linkage should be kept to a minimum.  Indirect linking—where two states are linked through a third—reduces regulatory autonomy and creates another layer of coordination requirements.  In other words, it can create problems both politically and in terms of policy design.  As such, we suggest that markets linked through a third party explicitly agree with each other on the terms.
4)      Banking and borrowing should be kept to a minimum. Banking and borrowing are designed to help smooth out prices over time by providing clear signals about future markets.  But they can also be gamed, and may propagate any flaws in the market into the future.  Linked markets should limit the number of allowances that can be banked or borrowed across time periods.
In sum, linkage will require extensive regulatory coordination.  And that coordination will invariably involve politics.  Thus, at the outset, simpler systems are better, both for the purposes of learning how to design working systems, and for reducing opportunities for political objections.
Linkage is not a panacea for climate change.   Indeed, if the current patchwork of carbon markets evolves into a global, or even a semi-global market, the associated political challenges may be on a par with a global agreement like Kyoto.   But if done slowly and deliberately, linkage can be one tool among many to help move states toward a lower-carbon future.

Heres the one person still defending Jim HaslettBy Dan Steinberg December 1 Follow @dcsportsbog
File photo. (By Jonathan Newton / The Washington Post)
We’re now at the point of the season where passionate debates about the 2015 season will dominate the Redskins landscape. Is the 2015 starting quarterback on the roster? Is Jay Gruden 100 percent guaranteed to be back? How many new starters will the defensive secondary need? How should the team use its first-round pick? And will Jim Haslett return as the defensive coordinator?
That last question has been a particular passion of Chris Russell’s, the ESPN 980 beat reporter who does not mind staking out an unpopular opinion. In this case, his unpopular opinion is that Jim Haslett is a good defensive coordinator who should not be blamed for Washington’s never-ending football misery.
For example, he wrote this after the Tampa Bay loss :
Jim Haslett’s unit fights their butt off. They make stops, they get off the field, they hold teams and keep a game close despite terrible field position and often very little help from special teams or the offense. Then they wilt on a big play or two and that was the case on Sunday.
And he wrote this after the San Francisco loss :
The defense was incredible for almost the entire game outside of a bad first drive. That was not pretty even though the 49ers took over at their own 40-yard line. I don’t care what you think about Jim Haslett – this game isn’t on him. Then again, neither was last week or the week before or the week before or the week before that.
And he wrote this after the Dallas win :
A final game ball goes to Jim Haslett. There probably hasn’t been a guy that has received more garbage from Redskins fans than this guy (save Albert Haynesworth). All Haslett does game in and game out is make the best out of what he has.
That hasn’t always been a lot when you consider a lack of depth, talent, free agency and draft resources. Haslett deserves a lot more than a game ball for how his defense has played for the most part all year. He deserves a contract extension.
Now, some fans have delighted in poking fun at Russell for this position over the last few months and years. And Sunday — when Haslett’s unit allowed 42 of Indianapolis’s 49 points, including touchdown plays of 30 yards, 49 yards, 48 yards, 73 yards, and 79 yards — Russell heard plenty from fans. So he finally gave up.
No, there is no news value here. But it’s amusing.

That's five forced turnovers by the #Redskins defense and they have SIX points last five quarters. I am done arguing.

— Chris Russell (@Russellmania980) November 30, 2014
But don’t despair. After the game, Russell reported on ESPN 980 that three different players told him the problem “is blown assignments by players; it is not a coaching issue.”

Cyber Monday cheat sheet: What to know about todays online dealsAn online shopper hunts for deals. (Brent Lewin/Bloomberg)
Online shoppers have already seen a bounty of deals served up on Black Thursday and Black Friday .
But Cyber Monday brings with it a fresh crop of promotions, and thus offers incentive to fire up your tablet or your laptop once again and check some gifts off your shopping list.  Here’s what you need to know if you’re planning to fill up a digital shopping cart on Monday:
*Good news for nighttime shoppers: Some of the deals are staggered this year. For anyone who sits in an office with an open floor plan, Cyber Monday can present a big conundrum:  You don’t want your cube mates (or, worse, your boss) to see you scrolling through screen after screen of knee-high leather boots or cashmere sweaters.  But you worry if you wait until after the work day to pounce, items might be sold out. Lucky for you, some retailers are trying to adapt their promotions for your 9-to-5 schedule.  Wal-Mart, for example, has announced its first ever “Evening Edition” of Cyber Monday sales , a slate of fresh deals that will come online sometime Monday night.  This batch of deals will include a Samsung 55-inch Ultra HD TV for $998 and the Hamilton Beach stand mixer for $24.   Amazon.com, meanwhile, is adding new deals every 10 minutes throughout the day. (Disclosure: The Washington Post is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.)
*Can’t shop on Monday? Don’t fret. We wrote last week about how Black Friday has bloated into several days, or even weeks, of discounts .  The same is true of Cyber Monday: Many retailers are spreading the discounts over several days, in some cases even changing the name of the promotion to “Cyber Week.”  Amazon kicked off its Cyber Monday sales on Saturday and plans for eight days of sales.  Some of the e-commerce giant’s deals include: 50 percent off Leap Frog toys, 25 percent off Philips DOT Bluetooth Speakers, and a Nest Thermostat for $199.  Wal-Mart, too, is dubbing its promotion “Cyber Week,” and is promising 500 new online deals every day through Dec. 5.  Target is also promoting a full “Cyber Week” this year and promises discounts on more than 100,000 items from Nov. 30 through Dec. 6.  Among the deals Target is touting is a KitchenAid stand mixer for $224.99, marked down from $449.99.  The retailer is also offering “buy one, get one 50 percent off” on My Little Pony and Star Wars toys.
*Buying electronics? This data can help you figure out where to go. Mobile shopping app ShopSavvy used its database of sales information to size up the deals this year.  When it comes to electronics products, ShopSavvy found that Best Buy will have the most products on sale: 638, compared to 409 of such items at Target and 257 at Wal-Mart.  Prefer to shop with whoever has the deepest discounts, not the greatest number of discounts?  ShopSavvy found that Wal-Mart will have the biggest average discounts on computers, followed by Amazon and NewEgg.com; the biggest average discounts on TVs will be at Amazon, followed by Target and then Best Buy.
 *You may have a little less shopping competition this year than last.  The National Retail Federation surveyed shoppers over Thanksgiving weekend to ask whether they planned to shop on Cyber Monday .  Fifty-two percent of respondents said they would shop on Monday, but that’s down a bit from the 54.8 percent who did so last year.
 *Any recommended reading to help me navigate the sales?  You bet.
Not sure what tech gifts should be on your list?  The Post has you covered .
You should be ready for  Elsa-mania .
Retailers are still going to be  competing intensely on price .
Retailers are in a  bigger-than-ever shipping battle  this year, and that’s creating new conveniences for you.
Interest in Cyber Monday, the biggest online shopping day of the year in the U.S, is growing globally as savvy online shoppers overseas click into the deals. (Reuters)

Bhopal changed very little in IndiaBhopal changed very little in India
Nitin Sethi | New Delhi Dec 02, 2014 12:45 AM IST
In 1995, India’s Parliament passed the National Environment Tribunal Act. The law was to provide compensation to victims of environmental accidents. It was to ensure special courts quickly decided damage, liability and compensation caused by industrial disasters — not only to people but to the environment also. It was passed after a decision of the Supreme Court in 1989 in  the Bhopal gas tragedy case.
Successive governments refused to notify the law that had been enacted. It was finally repealed in 2010, when the National Green Tribunal Act was passed. The Bhopal gas tragedy victims continue to fight a lonely but dogged legal battle for compensation and reparation.
On the 20th anniversary of the Bhopal tragedy in 2004, Usha Ramanathan, a legal expert, detailed how other laws, such as the Factories Act and the Public Liability Insurance Act, were also defanged after being first tightened to help against industrial disasters.
In these past three decades, India’s industrial scape has evolved rapidly and the post-liberalisation economy has spread industries across the country. At least 1,000 industrial plants and factories receive clearance from the Union government annually.
Implementation of other environment laws that were enacted as a consequence of the Bhopal tragedy, such as the Environment Protection Act, 1986, are today seen by governments of all hues as perpetuating a licence raj. Which might not be off the mark – they are bent easily to corrupt ends and have been rarely used to protect either the environment or those affected by industrial pollution.
Where’s the state?
But, as with so much in India, the fault may lie in the political economy of the country rather than the law. “If you look back, most of the cases where people have been compensated or where some liability has been enforced on polluting industries, it’s happened through public interest litigation and the courts. One cannot remember any significant case where the administration acted pro-actively to prevent or punish polluters,” says Ritwick Dutta, a senior environment lawyer.
What Ramanathan wrote a decade earlier for the Bhopal case stands true of the environmental safety agenda at large today. “In the 20 years since Bhopal, statutory law has moved, grudgingly, some distance, but it is in the courts that the law has been largely played out,” she said.
The capacity of governments to monitor and keep tabs on industrial safety and environmental degradation has been unable to keep pace with the growth of industries across the country. With the environment law in 1986, the government set up five regional offices across the country to monitor and regulate pollution. These offices had less than 10 people each, with only a couple at senior levels. The offices remain almost the same size and with as many people, while industries have popped up across the country and many more are in the pipeline.
Huge gap
Industrial sites might still be an easy point of source of pollution to monitor with some diligence. The greater challenge of environmental degradation over a long time from seeping pollution or occupational practices is yet to be tackled even in principle. The air pollution in Delhi and other metropolitan areas gets more than fair attention (though little resolution) from the courts and others. But victims of silicosis or asbestosis in factories, of leeching pesticides and of contamination of air and water from plants around industrial areas are not on the radar.
Victims fighting in courts and with the help of a growing environmental consciousness in public are able to bring up one or two cases to the limelight such as the endosulfan case in Kerala. However, the capacity of states to take cognisance is almost absent. Research and data will tell us academically that environmental damage is a public health crisis, eating into bodies and lives. Yet, there are only a handful of laboratories and a lesser number of scientists mandated to study the deadly link between environmental pollution and the disease burden that afflicts the country.
The Centre for Science and Environment notes, “In 2011, over 1,000 people lost their lives in factory accidents and several thousand were injured. Contamination of land and water is a growing problem. In 2010, 10 toxic sites housing thousands of tonnes of hazardous waste were identified by the Union ministry of environment and forests.”
Its director general, Sunita Narain, says: “We need to fix what is broken and not make new institutions that add to multiplicity and confusion. The institutions should monitor compliance and enforce their directions.”  
She is referring to the previous and current government’s plans to outsource its clearance and monitoring responsibilities to a new authority. This government, just as the previous government did, has reviewed environment laws. Three decades after they were passed, perhaps a review of environmental governance and not only the laws was required. “There has to be a strong environmental liability regime for victims of environmental crimes,” says Narain, “Systems of corporate liability cannot remain inadequate, as high-risk and unknown technologies pose new challenges.”
Heading an institution that stepped in to fill the gap in governance and set up its own laboratory for testing environmental pollution and its impact on societies, Narain has first-hand experience. One private laboratory or one public interest suit can only highlight the symptoms. Fighting the malaise of environmental degradation requires a systemic overhaul that India is quite far from.

Sun Pharma says minor delays in closure of Ranbaxy dealSun Pharma says minor delays in closure of Ranbaxy deal

Mumbai: Drug maker Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd on Friday said there may be minor delays in concluding the acquisition of Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd announced in April.
“While we target closure of Ranbaxy transaction by December, there may be minor delays to this timeline,” the company posted on its official Twitter account. The company added that the delay is not on account of competition regulations.
“We are seeing steady progress on regulatory milestones in Ranbaxy acquisition,” said a second tweet.
At 2.20pm, shares of Sun Pharmaceutical were trading down 2.7% from the previous close while India’s benchmark Sensex index rose 0.16%. Ranbaxy shares fell 3.4%.
Commenting on observations made by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Sun Pharma’s Halol facility, the company said that it is working towards addressing all observations made on the facility, adding that operations were continuing at the plant.
On Thursday, Sun Pharmaceutical reported a 15.4% increase in its consolidated net profit to Rs.1,572.46 crore in the September quarter, compared with Rs.1,362.3 crore in the year-ago period on increased sales in the domestic as well as export markets.
Net sales stood at Rs.4,750.53 crore for the quarter, up 13.32% from a year ago. The company saw growth in domestic sales, exports and markets outside the US. Branded generic sales in India increased by 21% at Rs.1,152 crore this quarter; US finished-dosage sales increased 15% at $481 million; and international formulation sales outside the US were at $89 million, an increase of 12% over the year-ago period.
Commenting on earnings guidance, the company, on its Twitter account said that its revenue guidance remains unchanged for now. In April, at the time of the annual results for fiscal 2014, Sun Pharma had given a revenue guidance of 13-15% growth in fiscal 2015.
“Some long-term non-recurring cost related to compliance, integration-planning, etc., may impact margins currently,” added the company.

Competition panel seeks public comments on Sun-Ranbaxy dealReliance MediaWorks sells Big Cinemas to Carnival Films

New Delhi: In the first-ever public scrutiny of a merger and acquisition (M&A) deal in India, fair trade watchdog Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Thursday invited comments from all stakeholders, including general public, on finer details of the $4 billion merger of Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd with rival drug maker Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd .
The comments need to be submitted to the CCI within 15 days, along with supporting documents on how the merger can adversely impact the concerned person or entity, the regulator said, while adding that it would not consider ‘unsubstantiated objections’ to the deal.
The CCI said the public consultation process has been launched “in order to determine whether the combination has or is likely to have an appreciable adverse effect on competition in the relevant market in India”.
Widening its scrutiny of the multi-billion-dollar deal, CCI had asked the two pharma companies on 27 August to make public-specific details of their proposed merger. Sun Pharma and Ranbaxy, which had announced a $4 billion deal in April this year, were asked to make public details of their proposed transaction in a “prescribed format”, which has been now put in public domain for “comments/objections/suggestions” from any person adversely affected or likely to be affected by the combination.
CCI chairman Ashok Chawla also said on 29 August that major issue in the deal is whether the combination would result in high market concentration of certain molecules. “The major issues obviously are that in many of the molecules, the basic building block in the pharmaceutical industry, whether in some of those molecules there is high market concentration which will emerge as a result (of the consolidation). That is the matter,” Chawla said.
The deal would create the fifth largest speciality generics company in the world and the largest pharmaceutical company in India. The combined entity would have operations in 65 countries, 47 manufacturing facilities across 5 continents, and a significant platform of speciality and generic products marketed globally.
In April, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries announced it would acquire troubled rival Ranbaxy Laboratories in a $4 billion deal that includes $800 million debt. The transaction valued Ranbaxy at 2.2 times its $1.8 billion revenue for 2013, or about Rs.457 per share. The deal has got ‘no-objection’ from the two exchanges, BSE and the National Stock Exchange, where the shares of two firms are listed, allowing them to file their scheme of amalgamation with the high court for further clearance of the deal.

Teenagers not hooked to Facebook anymoreTeenagers not hooked to Facebook anymore

A study involving 170,000 internet users across 32 countries has found that more and more teenagers are spending more time on instant messaging apps than on Facebook .
Nearly 66 per cent of teenagers (aged 16-19) in the US and Britain said they were using Facebook less frequently.
While the teenagers are not off the social networking site completely, the interactions have dropped and the group is more passive about the site as a whole, revealed the new "Social Summary for Q3 2014" from market research firm GlobalWebIndex (GWI).
"Even though Facebook has more users, activity such as photo sharing and messaging has fallen off by 20 per centage points in the last two years," the findings showed.
Nearly 30 per cent of teenagers said they are not on Facebook as often because their friends have gone on Instagram and other messaging apps, StreetInsider.com reported.
The report found that although Facebook has a drop in active users, its Messanger is not very popular among teenagers, even leaving WhatsApp behind as the most used messaging app.
Snapchat turns out to be the real winner among teenagers.
"Snapchat has the youngest audience of any social app and usage ranges from 25 per cent to 40 per cent of all online teenagers in key markets such as the US, Britain and Canada," the report added.

Who wants to be a CEOStory
Who wants to be a CEO?
The king is dead, long live the commoner. May she also stay out of CAG reports.
Team BT        Edition: Dec 21, 2014

Tim Cook is lauded for coming out of the closet and Satya Nadella lambasted for an insensitive remark on equal pay for women. Marissa Mayer is criticised for resuming work too soon - 14 days - after giving birth to a baby boy. Mark Zuckerberg's grey T-shirt is the biggest point of interest at some of his "news" conferences.
This is the era of the always-under-the-lens CEO. That gets compounded by the fact that this is also the era of the short-lived CEO.
The average CEO tenure shrank by nearly two years between the years 2000 and 2012. It rose slightly after that because a handful of them delayed their retirement to tide over the financial crisis. In the last four years alone, two General Motors CEOs were out in nine months each. In contrast, the first of them, Alfred P. Sloan Jr., lasted 23 years and 24 days in the job.
But then, Sloan was part of the first crop, those who took charge around the time the concept of the CEO took shape in 1917. They - Henry Ford, John D. Rockefeller, and others - were the modern, industrial monarchs. They were the human embodiment of their companies, the kind that went on to have foundations and fellowships named after them.
FULL COVERAGE: India's Best CEOs 2014
Their days are gone. Gone also is the office culture of the 1960s, where men drank and smoked in office meeting and dealt with their secretaries in a manner that would have them fired under today's laws. The end of that culture may have something to do with the rise of the woman CEO ; 26 of the Fortune 500 CEOs are women.
In India, some of the most redoubtable woman CEOs are in banking and financial services - the one sector that is not part of this year's BT Best CEO study. But the role of the CEO has expanded no less here. They have to not just manage their companies but also cope with rapidly changing policies - some of which change retrospectively - without the benefit of legal lobbying. They can no longer coast along once a licence has been obtained, as their predecessors before 1991 could.
The modern CEO still manages budgets, but that may seem like a cakewalk in comparison to managing talent. Today's workforce is a pool of people whose aspirations rise as their commitment to an employer falls. They are also fiercely touchy about access to the social media - ask Vishal Sikka of Infosys. The social media, by the way, also has customers and trolls. And the CEO has to deal with all this while making sure that her name, or that of her company, does not appear in a CAG report.
Given the travails, the least we can do is raise a toast to those who have done well. Turn the pages for stories of success and brace up to meet some unforgettable personalities.

M&M is betting on new businesses under Anand MahindraStory
Full throttle
Under Anand Mahindra's leadership, M&M is scaling up its existing businesses and also betting big on new ones.

The year was 2007. Ford was struggling to avoid bankruptcy. It had decided to sell its international assets including Aston Martin, Volvo, and Jaguar and Land Rover. Aston Martin was picked up by a consortium of private equity firms while Chinese automaker Geely bought Volvo.
About Anand Mahindra
In the race to buy Jaguar-Land Rover (JLR) were the Ratan Tata-led Tata Motors and the Anand Mahindra-led Mahindra & Mahindra. In the first round of bidding M&M was leading but then it pulled out, allowing Tata Motors to buy the iconic British brands.
Seven years later, Tata Motors' India unit is struggling. The company's fortunes are sustained by JLR , which made more profits ($2.9 billion) in 2013/14 than what Tata spent to acquire the company ($2.3 billion).
Does Mahindra regret not having gone ahead with the bid? "What became clear to us was if there was a downturn in the market, given the scale of the business, we would not have the wherewithal to withstand it," says Mahindra, who had called a friend in Ford at the time to ask if he was doing the right thing by stepping back. The friend concurred. "Anand, if there is a downturn you will lose your entire group," he warned him.
Indeed, days after the JLR deal, the economic meltdown set in and sales of the company fell sharply, causing huge losses. The poor performance of JLR weighed on Tata Motors, which survived thanks to its deep pockets. Mahindra's decision to withdraw, then, may have saved M&M from being dealt a massive body blow.
FULL COVERAGE: India's Best CEOs 2014
LONG-TERM VISION
M&M has grown steadily, expanding into new businesses. In the past three years, M&M's total income grew at an annual rate of 19 per cent to Rs 41,226 crore, while net profit and market capitalisation rose 13 per cent annually to Rs 3,756 crore and Rs 55,956 crore, respectively.
M&M's shares have more than doubled since January 2012
M&M is one of the largest vehicle manufacturers in India and the largest seller of tractors globally. The newer areas that the flagship M&M is venturing into is part of Mahindra's vision of taking the company to the next level. Over the years Mahindra looked at niche segments - except tractors - to build businesses. Recently, M&M has entered into defence and renewable energy sectors.
M&M's top and bottom lines have improved too
M&M was founded in 1945 by K.C. Mahindra, J.C. Mahindra and Ghulam Mohammed, under the name Mahindra & Mohammed. Mohammed in 1947 migrated to Pakistan to become its first finance minister. The company name changed to M&M. A steel trading company then, it started selling Willys Jeeps in India, the group's first brush with autos. Anand Mahindra is J.C. Mahindra's grandson.
Mahindra joined the group in 1981 as executive assistant to the Director of Finance in Mahindra Ugine after finishing his MBA from Harvard. It was a different India. Businesses were governed by the licence raj, where the government would select five to six companies to make or sell in any segment.
Mahindra Ugine, headed by Mahindra's father Harsh, was one of the six players which had licence to make specialised steel products for electric arc furnaces. "It was a cosy market, and nobody cared that I had joined," says Mahindra. But suddenly, in 1981, the government, for reasons Mahindra doesn't know, gave licences to 36 players to make electric arcs. As a result there was excess competition, something which Indian business houses were not used to. Prices plunged and there was surplus capacity in the sector.
Ugine didn't cut price and sales plummeted and the company posted its first loss. It was time for Mahindra to stand up and be counted. "When all hell broke loose, it was an opportunity for somebody new," he says. He turned around the company gradually by selling inventory and squeezing the supply chain.
He never looked back after that. In 1991, he became the Deputy Managing Director of M&M, then a maker of off-road and agriculture vehicles. The company's chairman was Keshub Mahindra, Anand's uncle and K.C. Mahindra's son.
"Anand created the war rooms. As a sector head, you need to come and tell what your strategy is, like a general"
VS PARTHASARATHY
CFO and CIO, M&M
After liberalisation, between 1991 and 1994, there were rumours of M&M businesses winding up. No one thought that Indian automakers would survive with companies like Ford, Daewoo and General Motors coming to India. "Rumours of our demise would be circulated every year," says Mahindra. "That's the wrong thing to tell me. It makes me determined to prove sceptics wrong."
That was also the time when Ford was looking for a partner in India. M&M had never made hard-top vehicles, so it grabbed the opportunity. A joint venture was formed with Ford but the car it launched failed to make an impact. But the 300-odd engineers at the venture had learnt making hard tops. The same team, headed by Pawan Goenka, made the Scorpio at a project cost of Rs 600 crore, the maximum M&M had ever invested in any project. Soon Scorpio became one of India's highest selling SUVs and M&M the biggest seller of utility vehicles.
AGAINST ALL ODDS
The other nominees: Very large companies
In the late 1990s, a consultancy firm (Mahindra doesn't want to name it) advised him to focus on tractors, where the company had global scale. But his gut feeling was that India had many more opportunities. He remembers how management thinker C.K. Prahalad came and taught a much younger Mahindra and Adi Godrej "to stick to our knitting". Mahindra was intrigued that the world did not believe emerging countries like India could have diversified conglomerates. Around the same time Harvard professors Tarun Khanna and Krishna Palepu wrote an article on the need for conglomerates to diversify in emerging markets.
Mahindra then decided to create a structure that will allow the group to be in multiple sectors. The businesses were divided into strategic units. "Earlier, there was no CEO for every unit," says V.S. Parthasarathy, M&M's CFO and Chief Information Officer. "Anand created the war rooms. As a sector head, you need to come and tell what your strategy is, like a general."
Mahindra focused on having independent presidents who would focus on their line of business. "Overnight I redrew the organisation chart and kicked myself upstairs," he says. Now, M&M has multiple lines of businesses - auto, technology, hospitality, retail, defence and aerospace, and steel - run by autonomous presidents. "These six new sub-entrepreneurs have made significant gains in their own wealth because they share the business," he says.
Mahindra's approach is "segmented strategy". He looks for niches. It's a contrast to the business strategies followed by some leading business houses in India. He cites the example of Reliance Industries - the company wants to dominate competition with its size. This is not Mahindra's strategy. Also, there is a central pool of money that can be used in different businesses. In the Mahindra Group, each company has its own balance sheet and its own cash flow to fund growth.
MAHINDRA'S LEGACY
Mahindra's new bets are defence, retail, aerospace and renewable energy. "We increasingly want to be in B2C (business to consumer) businesses, because it's my belief the biggest legacy you can leave behind is a brand. If you leave behind a solid umbrella brand, there is nothing better than bequeathing that to future generations and managers," says Mahindra.
The other nominees: Auto and Ancillaries (Large companies)
Mahindra says he is not worried about the health of the new businesses. "It is like dÃ©jÃ -vu for me. There were similar concerns then about each business we had started then, and all of them took longer to turn around than some of the businesses now," he says.
It took Mahindra 10 years to develop Club Mahindra. HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh had his reservations about Mahindra venturing into hospitality but he believed the sector had potential. The business, which started with Rs 30 crore, had touched $1 billion in value by 2007.
Indeed, Mahindra has not lost conviction in any of the businesses he has entered. When he entered the two-wheeler business, with the launch of the bike Stallio in 2010, everyone told him the two-wheeler market will take a hit because the Nano, the world's cheapest car, was being launched.
When he launched scooters, he was told not to enter that business because the scooter market was shrinking. But for the past couple of years scooter has been the fastest-growing two-wheeler business. But Mahindra's two-wheeler business is yet to take off. It had started as a joint venture with Kinetic Motors. That may have been a mistake. "One can look back and say we should not have launched with Kinetic. Perhaps it would have been better to wait for a couple of years and do our own R&D ," he says.
To execute plans, Mahindra has devised three "war rooms". The operations war room looks at the half-year performance of the company. Then there is the strategy war room where business teams sit together and debate strategy. The budget war room looks at the implementation of the strategy. Mahindra himself chairs all the war rooms, says S.P. Shukla, President of Group Strategy, Defence Sector, and Chief Brand Officer at M&M. "Anand dares to dream. As a chairman it is very important to do something beyond the day-to-day activity," says Shukla.
Over the past seven years, M&M has made some 50 acquisitions worth $5 billion. The most prominent ones include Satyam Computer and South Korean auto maker Ssangyong. He has turned around both companies.
Is M&M a reflection of the leader himself? "To any extent anything we do in the company is a reflection of me and I am a reflection of what the company is," says Mahindra. But he is not an autocrat. He says he will never take a decision if the business president is not convinced about the idea.
Mahindra tries not to be a workaholic, though his wife, Anuradha, doesn't agree. "My wife argues I am coming home to work (thanks to technology)," he says, pointing at his two mobile phones. But he does make a point to spend his weekends at his home in Alibaugh. "For me the ocean is a phenomenal comforting kind of presence. It makes you think long term because you see the tide coming and going, and whatever was there on the beach is washed away by the last tide. It's like visual meditation," he says.
There is a lot that still needs to be fixed, and businesses need to scale up. He wants to create a banyan tree with many roots anchored to the ground. There are only a few things he regrets, and not buying JLR is definitely not one of them. But his legacy is not complete yet - he is still in the process of shaping the Mahindra Group.

NFC business cards: Good option  just pray everyone has NFCWritten by Nandagopal Rajan | New Delhi |
Posted: November 28, 2014 3:13 pm | Updated: November 28, 2014 8:06 pm
Carrying too many visiting can literally be a pain. But what if you could make do with just one visiting card, even while going for a conference where every handshake is followed by a card exchanging ritual?
Yes, this is now a possibility thanks to a technology that is now becoming almost standard in smartphones, at least top-end ones. Printvenue.com has just launched its NFC (Near Field Communiation) visiting cards that allow people to pass on contact information without exchanging cards.
Printvenue.com sent one of their NFC visiting cards with my coordinates. The card is made of plastic and thicker than your regular visiting card. However, it will easily fit in your purse. The only issue is that it looks more like a loyalty card than a business card. The card has all your contact info printed on it too.
On the rear side of the card there is a QR code which can be used to pass on information to devices that don’t have NFC. For people who have NFC devices you just need to tap it on the back of the phone. I tried it on a friend’s BlackBerry Passport and it could not read anything. However, with a Sony Xperia Z2 it worked well. After the tap, the phone showed a message asking you to save the contact information on to your Google account. The same message pops up when you scan the QR code at the back.
The Printvenue.com page gives you multiple design options for the card, which is priced at Rs 399 per piece at the moment. This is a good option for people who have to hand out many business cards every week. The only issue here is that not everyone who wants your card will have a smartphone with NFC, or even one that reads QR codes. For them you might need to keep some old fashioned cards as backup.

Tiny Dinosaur Discovered In Asiareddit
A tiny dinosaur about the size of a house cat was recently discovered in South Korea.
The dinosaur's fossilized remains span about 11 inches, but scientists told Korea JoongAng Daily that it was likely about 20 inches long when it was alive.
“Based on the findings so far, we assume that the dinosaur is something close to a microraptor or others in the raptor genera,” Lim Jong-deock, chief curator of the National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage, told the news agency. “However, it’s uncertain at this stage exactly which type of dinosaur it was, and there is a chance that it is a new type that hasn’t been reported to academia as of yet .”
(Story continues below image.)
An illustration of a microraptor, which the dinosaur fossil closely resembles.
The tiny dino is a theropod, a family of carnivorous dinosaurs that includes Tyrannosaurus rex. That means it had sharp teeth and claws--only a whole lot smaller. And if it is indeed a microraptor, it would also have had four wings.
The dinosaur lived during the Cretaceous period, which ended some 66 million years ago with the Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction event.
“ The way this dinosaur has been fossilized is unique in that it was discovered with its vertebrae connected to its ribs ,” the institute told the Korea Times.
The institute also said there may be another fossilized dinosaur in the rock next to this one. Whatever the dinosaur turns out to be, it's the first complete dinosaur skeleton found in South Korea, and among the smallest dinosaur fossils ever found in the country.
" It is difficult for a small dinosaur to become fossilized and such fossils are very rare across the world ," an unnamed researcher from the National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage told Korea.net. "We need to conduct further research into whether the fossil is related to the Minisauripus, whose footprints were discovered in the southern areas of Gyeongsangnam-do."

As Bricks and Clicks Merge  Geeks Are Discovering Politicsreddit
As with the first industrial revolution, the merger of Clicks and Bricks forces us to ask: Which laws need to be updated, which are just irrelevant, and which are barriers to entry created by special interests?  Best placed to help our internet billionaires contribute to this important project are -- politicians, civil servants, lobbyists and other political hangers-on, looking for lucrative work.
America's statutes, policies and regulations (Laws) are designed for a non-digital world -- a world where a taxi was something you hailed on the street, not by clicking a smartphone app. The world of Bricks (i.e., the older traditional economy) and Clicks (i.e, the newer tech-fueled  economy) are merging. With this merger, we are forced to examine our existing Laws (a point also made by Fareed Zakaria ).  As companies scramble to lobby the government for the most favorable results, political types and high powered lobbyists will be in great demand (e.g., David Plouffe -- a key strategist behind President Obama's two presidential wins -- recently joined Uber).
Originally, computers (e.g., the IBM 700/7000 series circa 1952 ) had little direct interaction with the world of Bricks.  They were used for: artillery trajectory tables, payroll and accounting, and similar behind-the-scenes work.  The machines took up entire rooms, and operated in batch mode(1).
Moore's law (computer processing power doubles every 18-36 months) has proved unrelenting.  As processing costs decline exponentially and other technologies advance, the worlds of Bricks and Clicks are merging.
Cabs have existed for centuries -- London has had taxi service since 1654 . And renting out a spare room has been happening for centuries. What has changed -- and the impact is dramatic -- is the decline in transaction costs and the resulting increase in market efficiency brought about by adding the world of Clicks to the world of Bricks. This has triggered the rise of the sharing economy, among many other manifestations.
Innovations -- such as, Uber's uniting dynamic pricing, smartphones, GPS, stored billing information, a two way rating system (you rate the driver and the driver rates you) and much else -- make the new economy a very efficient system for transacting business, thereby resulting in more business activity.
But merging Clicks with Bricks creates friction with old Laws from the pre-Click world, which can be categorized as:
Laws that remain necessary, in some form, in our digital era: For example, most cities have auto inspection and safety rules for vehicles, particularly for vehicles that carry paying passengers. The safety concerns are the same, whether the passenger is picked up by Lyft, Uber or a traditional car/taxi service. These Laws served a legitimate purpose prior to the merging of Clicks and Bricks, and that purpose remains applicable, even in the digital age.
Laws that are obsolete in the digital era: As an example, in a different time, when horses were the major mode of urban transportation, all sorts of Laws were created specifically for an era of horse traffic.  Most of these are now irrelevant, or have been repealed. But those remaining from that era must be re-examined (and eliminated or revised) if unnecessary or detrimental to new needs and goals.
Laws that never had any good reason to exist, but were the result of special interests creating barriers to entry, as discussed in more detail below.
As Adam Smith said:
People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.
One way for businesses to conspire against the public is to have government create artificial barriers to entry, and thereby generate  unearned profits for politically connected businesses.
For example, the number of yellow taxis allowed on the streets of NYC at any one time is restricted to 13,437 . No matter how great the demand, the capacity of the streets, the time of year, or the strength or weakness of the NYC economy -- only 13,437 yellow cabs are allowed. The number 13,437 doesn't reflect a perfect balance of the laws of supply and demand -- demand for the privilege of driving a yellow cab far outstrips the supply. The current price for a medallion (i.e., the right to have a yellow taxi on the streets of NYC) -- about $1 million -- reflects this high demand.
NYC medallion owners are a concentrated special interest group, with a financial interest in limiting the issuance of new medallions. The general public also has an interest in the taxi industry -- more and better service -- but for most people, this isn't their highest priority. For medallion owners, however, the taxi medallion is of utmost importance  since it represents their very livelihood. Medallion owners, therefore, can have an outsized influence on this one narrow issue. But the rise of Uber and similar services means we suddenly have new and powerful interests at the table, challenging old rules.
This isn't just about the taxi industry.  This challenge will occur across the entire economy.  One benefit of this merging of Bricks and Clicks is a  "housecleaning" of our Laws.  As significant new participants emerge, they'll seek to remove government barriers that hinder their business models.  However, these new competitors will behave as Adam Smith predicted, and attempt to create new barriers to trade benefitting their own interests.  Arguably this process has already begun - newcomer Uber was recently accused of encouraging taxi regulations that would favor its business model, and make it more difficult for new entrants.  Capitalism is innovative and efficient, but not always admirable.
My one prediction: For both well-funded new competitors (trying to revise or create Laws that benefit their interests), and old form competitors (with tremendous incentives to protect their turf), civil servants, politicians, lobbyists and others of their ilk will be in high demand!

Bergdorf Goodman s Swanky Black Friday Sale Is Nothing Like The Usual Frenzy ElsewhereBergdorf Goodman's Swanky Black Friday Sale Is Nothing Like The Usual Frenzy Elsewhere

NEW YORK -- While millions of shoppers battle their way through hysterical crowds to save a buck at stores like Walmart and Target on Black Friday, some who have more cash to spend are enjoying the more refined side of the annual weekend of shopping mania.
They're partaking in Bergdorf Goodman's Black Friday sale. Yes, Fifth Avenue's storied monument of luxury holds a special event on a day known for mass discounts and wild fights for merchandise. And it's nothing like the frenzies across the country, which started on Thanksgiving night. While some battled for Barbie dolls , brawled over baby clothes or got zapped with a stun gun , those who can afford to shop at Bergdorf's waited until morning.
The luxury department store is calm before its 8 a.m. opening, prepping for a 12-hour day. A few shoppers wait outside each of the many revolving-door entrances. There are no barricades. No lines. No tent cities. No cheering. No fanfare. Just employees waiting patiently inside and customers waiting patiently outside. When it's time, the greeters wave them in and the shopping begins.
One worker chuckles and reports to his colleagues that there were about 20 shoppers who came in through his door. Another replies that seven customers entered on his side. It takes a couple of seconds to get the waiting customers into the store, as smiling employees hand out $50 gift cards to be redeemed on the beauty products. In the jewelry area, every room glistens under the lights.
A holiday display of coats inside Bergdorf Goodman on Black Friday. Most merchandise isn't on sale, even today.
The Black Friday sales here aren't like the ones from the lower reaches of retail -- Bergdorf is simply too exclusive for that. Where Gap flaunts 50 percent off everything in the store, Bergdorf just offers an extra 20 percent off already marked-down clothes, shoes and handbags on the fifth floor. Some designer sportswear is on sale at 40 percent off, too. Though there are some deeply discounted items at Bergdorf on Friday, it manages to retain its exclusive feel.
That exclusivity is what attracts people to Bergdorf's extravagant halls. Founded in 1899 and now owned by Neiman Marcus Group, the department store sells all sorts of luxury goods: clothes, shoes, handbags, jewelry, housewares and more. It has only two locations, the main store and a men's store right across the street on Fifth Avenue, near the southeast corner of Central Park.
Many shoppers head downstairs to the beauty floor, where there are a wide array of branded kiosks. Bergdorf offers plenty of Black Friday perks down here: complimentary brow lessons from Bobbi Brown, depuffing facials from Amore Pacific and reflexology hand massages from La Prairie.
Others head up to the fifth floor, which features contemporary designer goods. The racks are filled with brands like Helmut Lang, Rag & Bone and Phillip Lim. There are $1,200 Tamara Mellon dresses, $200 tops from Theory and $500 sweaters from Elie Tahari all marked down. The shoppers quietly look through the garments, seeking the standouts. They find plenty and bring their hauls to nearby workers who ring up the purchases.
On the fifth floor of Bergdorf Goodman, the sales floor is filled with marked-down merchandise from contemporary designers.
A little less than an hour after opening, the sales floor gets busier. But it's not raucous and nobody's acting frantic. The loudest noise comes from the racks themselves, squeaking sharply each time someone slides over a hanger. Then, a supervisor's voice cuts through the room. "I hate to be the bearer of bad news," he tells a pair of his employees chatting softly near one of the racks, "but less conversation, more work." Everything remains tidy, employees darting around to make sure the area remains pristine. It's unclear how big of an event this is for Bergdorf -- a company representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Though it's Black Friday, this is still where the affluent go to spend thousands and thousands of dollars on clothes. The vast majority of merchandise in the store remains at full price, maintaining its luxe integrity. These areas churn onward, glitzy money-making machines that are too swank for discounts.
On the second floor, women gleefully try on red-soled Christian Louboutin heels, none of which cost less than $675. And on the ground floor, surrounded by staggeringly pricey handbags from the likes of Saint Laurent and Givenchy, a saleswoman sees one of her regulars. "Nancy!" she exclaims, eager to unveil her latest wares. "It just came in."

Enrich work environment to make employees  brains tickEnrich work environment to make employees' brains tick, says Doraiswamy
E. Kumar Sharma        Last Updated: December 1, 2014  | 12:26 IST
P. Murali Doraiswamy, Professor and Director, Mental Fitness Lab, Duke University.
Companies should not only think about their financials-balance sheets, cash reserves, etc. But must also pay attention to improving the performance of their employees' brains, P. Murali Doraiswamy, Professor and Director, Mental Fitness Lab, Duke University, said at the BT MindRush conclave of business leaders in New Delhi on Saturday.
Doraiswamy said there are seven important mantras to take care of the biggest asset we have-the brain-and keep it healthy. He listed them as: "enrich your work environment; ensure the heart is healthy with proper exercise and diet; you get enough downtime and at least 7 hours sleep; reduce multi-tasking; have emotional awareness; social networks help; and finally, think young."
Citing a survey of global CEOs, he said that top executives travel a lot, have less sleep and spend little time with their families.
"It is lonely at the top and they don't get enough time to address their own needs," he said.  Keeping in mind the theme of the BT MindRush, Ride the Tide: Making the most of Good Times, he said, "You don't live and are depressed and stressed, you cannot ride the good times."
He divided his lecture, a term he eschews, into six parts. He started out referring to a slide from the new movie "Lucy" that talked about a premise in the movie that we use only 10 per cent of the total capacity of our brains.

While we do not know if that is true, he said, what is correct is that brain ability can be increased by five or six-fold. Just in the last 100 years human IQ has gone up by 30 points and that is because of better nutrition, better child-care, better pregnancy care and better healthcare. So, the environment plays an important role. The first major point, therefore, he said was need to enrich the work environment.
Doraiswamy said there are 100,000 miles of blood vessels in the brain. The brain weighs only two per cent of the total body weight but uses 20 per cent of the blood supply of the entire body. It is a high energy user and it is important to ensure blood supply to brain.
He cited the example of Google, where the company has hired a person whose sole job is to increase the lifespan of all employees by 30 years.
Showing a picture of neurons, or nerve cells, in the brain, he said they are connected and form the grey matter. "There are more connections here than there are stars in the universe... the adult brain is rewiring everyday.... neurons that fire together, wire together... if you don't persist with it, the brain goes back to its earlier nature - you use it or loose it." An important message from him was that a healthy heart is important for the brain. "What is good for the heart is good for the brain," he said.

Everest climber Jamling Tenzing Norgay
Climbing mountains, just like doing business, requires vision and dedication, Everest climber Jamling Tenzing Norgay told a packed house of top industry executives at the second edition of Business Today MindRush conclave in New Delhi on Saturday.
Jamling said he relied on his support team, primarily the Sherpas to get on the top of the mountain. "When you have a better team there are better chances of success. Sherpas are the unsung heroes of most mountaineering expeditions. I am working on getting them the recognition they deserve."
FULL COVERAGE: MindRush 2014
He exhorted the executives to set new challenges and not be afraid of hurdles. "An inner burning desire and passion is all that you need. The higher you get the slower you get. Take a break, rest and get oxygen."
Citing the example of his father Tenzing Norgay, who was the first to get on the top of Everest with New Zealander Edmund Hillary in 1953, he said that no matter what background one comes from the goals can be achieved if there is passion and drive. The late elder Norgay and Hillary came from different backgrounds, did not know each other's language and could not communicate and yet they together reached the top of Everest, Norgay added.

Indigestion over the Obama girlsBy Ruth Marcus November 30 Follow @RuthMarcus
On the subject of the Obama girls’ supposedly disrespectful behavior at the Thanksgiving turkey pardoning: not even close to unpardonable.  As my teenaged daughters would say to the Republican congressional staffer who took to Facebook to take off after Sasha and Malia: Hello?  Have you, like, ever even met a teenager?
President Obama speaks as his daughters Sasha, center, and Malia listen before the pardon of two turkeys during a ceremony at the White House on Nov. 26. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images)
“I get you’re both in those awful teen years, but you’re a part of the First Family, try showing a little class,” lectured Elizabeth Lauten, congressional schoolmarm — oops, I mean, communications director — for Rep. Stephen Lee Fincher (R-Tenn.).
“Then again your mother and father don’t respect their positions very much…so I’m guessing you’re coming up a little short in the ‘good role model’ department,” Lauten continued, venturing deeper into failing-to-practice-what-you-preach territory. “Dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar. And certainly don’t make faces during televised public events.”
Where to start with this infuriating rant.  First, to say that it so crossed the line that Lauten retracted it, saying she had “quickly judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager” and that “after many hours of prayer, talking to my parents, and re-reading my words online I can see more clearly just how hurtful my words were.”
Second, while Lauten’s below-the-belt jabs would have been wrong under any circumstances, they were particularly wrong since the Obama girls’ demeanor wasn’t even close to the edge of the sassy teenager spectrum. (Believe me, I know.)
At 13 and 16, having to stand next to your parent for any stretch of time feels like cruel and unusual punishment.  Having to stand next to your parent in front of television cameras, even worse.  And while he pardons a turkey?  And asks if you want to pet it?  Does he think you are a child?
Given all that, I thought the girls did fine.  No audible sighing.  No “da-ad” said in the exasperated teenaged way, extending the parental appellation into a multisyllabic epithet.  If there was a soupcon of eye-rolling and a stretch of get-me-outta-here arm-crossing, well—they were props at a turkey pardoning, for heaven’s sake. I thought it remarkable that two girls that age could be separated from their cell phones for so long.
As to the dress, Elizabeth, excuse me: have you been to a high school recently?  Or a bar, for that matter?  The skirts were a bit short, but in the calculus of parent-child clothing battles, hardly worth fighting over.
Third, to criticize Lauten is not to say that presidential children are off limits.  They aren’t.  If they get used as props, as in the turkey pardoning–well, some commentary goes with the territory.  President Obama is particularly fond of invoking his daughters to make a point, as in lecturing Congress that Malia and Sasha get their homework done.  By doing so, he opens the door to public discussion.
But only a crack.  The older the presidential child, the worse the presidential child’s behavior, the fairer the game for discussion.   I’ve gone there myself: back in 2006, after a series of sackings at the George W. Bush White House, I wrote a snarky faux thank-you-for-your-service letter to the Bush twins , introducing them to new First Daughter Chelsea Clinton.  The White House was not pleased.
But that was parody, and with ample ammunition (underage drinking busts, etc.)  This was sheer meanness, and with little basis.  There’s a new turkey in town, and she’s not likely to get a presidential pardon.
At the 67th anniversary of the National Thanksgiving Turkey presentation on Wednesday, President Obama pardoned two Ohio turkeys that will now live at the home of a former Virginia governor. (AP)

Samajwadi Party red faced over eviction notice  members create ruckus in Rajya SabhaBy: Press Trust of India | New Delhi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 3:57 pm | Updated: December 1, 2014 4:03 pm
Eviction notice to Samajwadi Party member Neeraj Shekhar from an official bungalow on Monday created uproar in Rajya Sabha as party members raised the issue accusing the government of vendetta.
Soon after the start of Question Hour, (SP) raised the issue seeking Chairman Hamid Ansari’s protection over the issue, as other party members joined by Congress accused the government of doing so deliberately.
Despite assurances by the Chairman and Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi that the issue will be resolved as per rules, SP and Congress members created ruckus forcing Ansari to adjourn the House for one hour.
The Question Hour, whose timing has been changed by the Chairman from 11 AM to 12 noon, became a casualty as members refused to allow the House to function and instead wanted the issue to be resolved.
“I need your protection as one of our members, who is a two-term Lok Sabha member and has now come to the Rajya Sabha has been issued eviction notice from his official bungalow. I have been a victim of this, I need your protection…He has lived in this house since 1967,” Bachchan said.
She was supported by party colleagues, who accused the government of doing it deliberately out of “vendetta”.
Congress members too were on their feet raising similar accommodation problems.
The Chairman said housing issues cannot be discussed in the House as there was a separate Housing Committee for it.
“The matter has been taken note of. Allow the matter to be sorted out. The matter is in the know of the government,” he said.
Naqvi tried to assure the agitated SP members saying, “As per Supreme Court directives, the house in question is in the name of someone else and he is not living…I have given the information to the Minister who is looking into it and will do whatever can be done as per rules.”
This assurance, however, did not clam down the SP members. They kept shouting and were joined by Congress, forcing the Chair to adjourn the House till 1 PM.

An Afghan official says a suicide bomber detonated his payload at a crowded funeral, killing two police and seven civilians.
Taj Mohammed Taqwa, chief of the Burka district in the Baghlan province north of Kabul, says the attacker appeared to be targeting police and local officials, including him, who were among some 1,000 people attending Monday’s funeral.
Taliban insurgents have stepped up attacks across Afghanistan in the run-up to the official end of the U.S. and NATO combat mission on Dec. 31, raising concerns about whether local security forces will be able to protect the country as foreign troops shift to a supporting role.

Ten years ago, Scott Lazerson took three months off from his job as an independent media strategist — but not for a sabbatical or vacation. He had stage three testicular cancer, and he was so ill after he started his second round of chemotherapy that he simply couldn’t work.
“I think I was in bed most of the time,” said Lazerson, now 44, who lives in Utah in the US. “I was just so, so sick.”

How to start a side business
Although Lazerson applied for Social Security disability benefits (available as a stop-gap support measure from the US government) to help cover his missing income, he never received any — Social Security disability doesn’t kick in until the sixth full month of disability, and as the owner of his own PR firm, Lazerson didn’t have an individual disability insurance policy (or access to employer-sponsored benefits).  
His wife was able to do some consulting to cover their major bills, and they received some financial assistance from family and a former employer who graciously paid their mortgage for three months.
“We had to cut back on everything, and we were truly in survival mode,” Lazerson said.
Lazerson isn’t alone. A surprising number of cancer patients don’t receive any employer-funded or government support during a medical crisis — either because their employer doesn’t offer it, they didn’t opt into it or they don’t qualify. Those that do might only receive a fraction of their typical salary.
In the US, 30% of middle-income cancer survivors racked up $10,000 or more in debt, according to a study by the Washington National Institute for Wellness Solutions. And people diagnosed with cancer are more than 2.5 times more likely to experience bankruptcy, according to another study from the Public Health Sciences Division in the US. In the UK, cancer patients on the whole owe as much as £2.8million ($4.38 million) in overdue payments to providers, according to Macmillan Cancer Support.
Getting through cancer treatment is difficult enough, without the additional financial burden. Here are some ways to minimise the damage.
What it will take: You’ll need fortitude and discipline to manage what may be a decrease in income at a time when your medical expenses are climbing. 
How long you need to prepare: Most people aren’t prepared for cancer before they’re diagnosed — with the exception of those who’ve built up an emergency fund. From the moment you’ve been diagnosed, you’ll want to start reducing expenses and putting as much money away as possible, in case you have to take an unpaid or reduced-pay leave from work.
Do it now: Understand your health insurance. Your medical coverage — particularly in the US — will often dictate how much of your costs for care will be out of pocket. Find out how your plan deals with prescription drugs, home care, experimental cancer therapy and counselling. If you don’t understand something, call your insurer or the government body that administers insurance, such as your province or territory’s health ministry in Canada, and keep track of dates, times and contacts for each conversation. Knowing how your policy handles certain expenses will help you make choices that can keep costs down — such as using in-network providers whenever possible.
See what benefits are available to you. In Canada, there is a federal program called Employment Insurance (EI) Sickness Benefits . “That is for individuals who are unable to work because of sickness, injury or quarantine, and provides 15 weeks of benefits,” said Gabriel Miller, director of public issues at the Canadian Cancer Society. After 15 weeks, there are social-assistance programs available through provinces.
In the US, find out from your human resources department whether you have short-term or long-term disability insurance, which replaces 60% to 70% of your income.
“Keep in mind that it can hurt you to put off going on short-term disability,” said Katherine Sharpe, senior vice president of cancer control patient support and survivorship for the American Cancer Society. “Some people have had to go to great lengths to prove that they can’t do their job after they’ve spent weeks forcing themselves to go to work when they could barely get out of bed.” You might also be eligible for Social Security disability income , although qualifying can be tough, and benefits don’t start until your sixth calendar month of disability.
In Australia, you may be entitled to Centrelink payments (Social Security) while you are unable to work for an extended period and not receiving any income. You may also have an income-protection insurance policy attached to your superannuation, or retirement fund. “There is a waiting period before income-protection insurance payments are made, and they are typically paid as a percentage of your usual salary,” said Annie Miller, manager of practical support for the Cancer Council NSW in Australia.
Cut back — on everything. If your income has decreased, every dollar matters. Let go of your premium cable channels, and contact creditors and utility companies if payments are going to be an issue. Keep in mind that some costs may increase due to treatment or illness — you may have to crank up the heat to deal with chills or add some expensive foods to your diet.
Seek financial guidance. “Do not wait until you are in deep financial crisis before seeking advice and help regarding your financial matters,” said Annie Miller. “Financial counsellors can act as an advocate requesting mortgages to be frozen or to arrange extended credit card repayment plans.”
Ask about a flexible work plan. Depending on your employer and occupation, you may be able to fashion an arrangement that still allows you to work, even part time. Telecommuting or working more flexible hours might help, as could scheduling medical treatments late in the day or before the weekend, so you have time to recuperate before you have to hit your desk again.
Do it later: Keep track of your expenses. In the US, for instance, you can deduct medical expenses on your taxes once they exceed 10% of your adjusted gross income. That includes payments for prescription medications, appointments, tests and even transportation if it’s primarily for medical care.
Do it smarter: Don’t be shy about asking for aid. “Most families find it hard to turn to others, or to public agencies and outside groups for financial help,” Sharpe said. “The extra expenses of cancer may be the first time a family has had problems with money. Families should remember that their problems in this situation are often short-lived and not unique.”
You can also find a wealth of information and support at cancer societies and associations in your area.

Govt says no to re-appoint Mallya as Kingfisher CMDGovt rejects Kingfisher Airlines' plea to re-appoint Vijay Mallya as CMD
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: December 1, 2014  | 20:26 IST
Vijay Mallya, United Breweries Group chairman (Photo: Reuters)
In a fresh blow to United Breweries Group chief Vijay Mallya, the government has rejected an application by Kingfisher Airlines to re-appoint him as Managing Director.
Kingfisher Airlines , the home-grown private carrier which had to be grounded in October 2012 due to severe financial crunch, had sought the approval of the Corporate Affairs Ministry for re-appointing Mallya for a five-year period beginning October 16, 2013 "without remuneration".
The airline has already faced actions by domestic bourses for non-compliance to listing agreement as it has failed to submit financial results for the past few quarters and to make other mandatory disclosures.
The company said in a regulatory filing that its application for re-appointing Mallya as MD has been rejected.
No specific reason could be immediately ascertained for the rejection.
The disclosure comes on a day, when another UB Group firm Mangalore Chemicals and Fertilizers announced Mallya's resignation as a director without giving any reason.
Besides, minority shareholders of United Spirits had last week rejected several proposals including those about dealings of the company with Mallya, whose group has sold controlling stake to British liquor giant Diageo.
The UB Group chairman is already engaged in legal tussle with several lenders who are trying to recover their loans amounting to thousands of crores of rupees from Kingfisher and some of them have also declared Mallya as a wilful defaulter .
UB Group has sold stakes in some other ventures as well including brewery business and a sports venture.
Kingfisher shares incidentally rose on Monday by about five per cent to Rs 1.34. The company currently commands a market value of about Rs 100 crore, as against a high of over Rs 10,000 crore before troubles began at the airline in late 2012.
Mallya is Chairman and Managing Director of Kingfisher Airlines, while it has been without a CEO ever since Sanjay Agarwal left the company in early 2014.
The private carrier is already under regulatory scanner for alleged accounting lapses.

Putin in Turkey amid SyriadifferencesBy: Associated Press | Ankara |
Posted: December 1, 2014 7:42 pm
Russia’s President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish host, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, were expected to gloss over their striking differences over the crises in Syria and Ukraine during talks on Monday, focusing instead on their countries’ booming economic and trade ties.
Putin arrived in Turkey accompanied by a large delegation, including 10 ministers, for discussions officials say will concentrate on trade, including a Turkish demand for a price reduction on natural gas purchases from Russia.
The two countries, who are major trading partners, have set an aim of increasing their two-way trade volume from the current USD 33 billion to USD 100 billion by 2020. Russia provides the bulk of Turkey’s gas and is set to build Turkey’s first nuclear power plant.
Turkish construction firms are active in Russia while millions of Russian tourists travel to Turkey each year. The Russian and Turkish leaders, often compared to each other for their drift toward authoritarianism, have opposing positions on Syria’s crisis.
Russia remains Syrian leader Bashar Assad’s closest ally while Turkey supports Syria’s opposition forces and Erdogan makes no secret of his desire to see Assad deposed. Turkey has expressed concerns over Russia’s annexation of Crimea. Turks have ethnic ties to the Crimean Tatars in the region and Turkey has pledged to defend their rights.
Putin will be welcomed at Erdogan’s new mega-palace that has drawn the ire of Turkish opposition parties, environmentalists and activists who say the 1,000-room complex is too costly and extravagant and went ahead despite a court ruling.

Posted: December 1, 2014 7:16 pm | Updated: December 2, 2014 12:16 pm
Left-arm spinner Taijul Islam became the first bowler to claim a hat trick on his debut in limited-overs international cricket Monday as Bangladesh completed a 5-0 series win against Zimbabwe.
Bangladesh won the fifth match by five wickets.
Islam’s 4-11 helped Bangladesh dismiss Zimbabwe for 128 in 30 overs before Bangladesh claimed victory by scoring 130-5 in 24.3 overs, Mahmudullah hitting 51 not out including two consecutive boundaries to secure victory.
“We’re very happy,” said the Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza. “Taijul was brilliant today…”
His Zimbabwe counterpart Elton Chigumbura conceded that his team needs to work on eliminating batting errors.
“We’ve performed in patches and we need to look at that, especially with the World Cup coming up,” he said.
“We need to correct our mistakes… The main thing is the batting and we need to improve quickly.”
Mahmudullah hit 10 boundaries in his 55 balls knock to record his 11th career half century and second in succession for Bangladesh.
Mahmudullah shared a 35-runs partnership with Mushfiqur Rahim (11) for the fifth wicket after Zimbabwe’s pacemen had Bangladesh wobbling at 58-4.
Zimbabwe made the task more difficult for Bangladesh when they removed Rahim at 93-5 before Mahmudullah took control.
Debutant Soumya Sarkar made 20 and Sabbir Rahman was unbeaten on 13.
Zimbabwe fast bowler Tendai Chatara had career best figures of 3-44 while his new ball partner Tinashe Panyangara took 2-49.
For Zimbabwe, Hamilton Masakadza top scored with 52 and Vusi Sibandan hit 37 in an innings dismantled by Islam, his fellow left-arm spinner Shakib Al Hasan (3-30) and leg-spinner Jubair Hossain (2-41).
Islam completed his hat trick in two overs, starting with Tinshae Panyangra (0), who was deceived by the flight of the final delivery of his sixth over.
He claimed John Nyumbu (3) and Tendai Chatara (0) with his next two balls to become the fourth Bangladeshi player to claim a one-day hat trick after left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak and pacemen Shahadat Hossain and Rubel Hossan.
Zimbabwe lost opener Sikandar Raza (9) to Mashrafe Bin Mortaza (1-23) at 16-1 before Masakadza and Sibanda settled the innings with a 79-run stand.
Hossain then claimed Masakadza – who hit five boundaries and three sixes in his 25th half century – as Zimbabwe collapsed, losing nine wickets for 33 runs.

Revival: Maruti  Honda report good sales in NovNEW DELHI: Showing signs of revival in auto industry, major car makers Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, Honda and Toyota today reported good sales for November even as some others faced sluggish demand due to weak consumer sentiment.
General Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra and Ford India recorded decline in November sales.
Country's largest car maker Maruti Suzuki said its domestic sales in the month stood at 1,00,024 units, up 17 per cent from 85,510 units in November last year.
Sales in the compact segment comprising Swift, Estilo, Ritz and Dzire rose by 13.8 per cent to 37,339 units in November as against 32,804 units in the same month last year.
Sales of mid-sized sedan Ciaz, which was launched in October, stood at 5,232 units. The company had sold 200 units of SX4 sedan in November 2013.
Sales of vans -- Omni and Eeco-- rose by 52.1 per cent each to 12,203 units in November this as compared to 8,021 units in the same month of previous year.
Rival Hyundai Motor India Ltd (HMIL) sold 35,511 units last month in the domestic market as compared to 33,501 units in November 2013, up 6 per cent.
HMIL Senior Vice President (Sales and Marketing) Rakesh Srivastava said strong investment of launching four new products in a year's time has resulted in the growth.
"Today Hyundai has one of the youngest product portfolio led by Elite i20 which has reached a landmark number of 10,500 units making it the top seller amongst strong Hyundai brands," he added.
Honda Cars India reported 64 per cent increase in domestic sales in November at 15,263 units as against 9,332 units in the same month last year.
"We continue to witness strong demand for all our products across markets. We are aggressively expanding our dealer network to reach out to more customers," HCIL Senior Vice-President (Marketing & Sales) Jnaneswar Sen said.
Mahindra & Mahindra's domestic sales declined by 11 per cent to 32,100 units last month as against 36,261 units a year earlier.
"The auto industry continues its sluggish demand on the back of factors such as low consumer sentiment and high interest rates," M&M Chief Executive Automotive Division and International Operations (AFS) Pravin Shah said.
The reducing international crude prices and the subsequent lowering of fuel prices should help in the revival of demand in the coming months, he added.
"We also hope that the current excise duty rates will be extended beyond end of December to get much needed recovery for the auto industry," Shah said.
Maruti Suzuki India, Hyundai and Mahindra had failed to register significant sales growth in October despite the festival season which had been one of the best periods for vehicle sales in the country in the past.

Government to give legal recognition to gold jewellery hallmarking

BIS
(After about 15 years of launching…)
NEW DELHI: After about 15 years of launching a hallmarking scheme for gold jewellery, the government now plans to give it legal recognition through amendment to Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) Act but is yet to take a call on making the process mandatory.
In a consultation meeting with stakeholders on amendments to the BIS Act 1986, Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan today expressed concern over quality of gold jewellery.
Questioning the current practice of BIS, the national standard making body, to certify quality of gold of as low as 9 carat, Paswan asked the BIS to examine whether the jewellers are disclosing the quality of gold in terms of carats while selling and also to check the pricing mechanism of different grades of precious metal jewellery.
"I have heard of only about 18-24 carat gold. I am not aware of 9 carat gold. Are there different rates of gold in shops for different carats of gold?" Paswan asked BIS officials and directed them to file a report on this matter.
When Consumer Affairs Secretary Keshav Desiraju tried to explain that BIS is only certifying agency for quality of gold ranging from 9-24 carats, Paswan told Desiraju that he is also secretary for the department that is responsible for consumer protection.
Paswan said the Ministry has received the suggestion that BIS should certify gold jewellery only of 18-24 carats and the same would be considered after getting the BIS report.
He stated that there is very little awareness about gold hallmarking among consumers.
"Through the amendment of BIS Act, we are giving a legal status to gold hallmarking but it will remain a voluntary standard," he said, adding that the decision on making hallmarking of gold jewellery mandatory has not been taken yet.
Hallmarking of gold jewellery was started by BIS in April 2000 to provide third party assurance to consumers on the purity of gold jewellery or its fineness.
Under the scheme, a jeweller has to obtain licence from BIS to get his jewellery hallmarked. The hallmark can be done at any Assaying and Hallmarking centres recognised by the BIS.
Elaborating on the need to amend the BIS Act, Paswan said the government wants to "simplify every process including the registration, without making any comprise on standards".
He said the Ministry is trying to bring this amendment before the Cabinet and the Parliament at the earliest.
The proposed amendments includes allowing BIS to make standards for more products from the current 90 items and enhancement of penalties, besides permitting the BIS to make standards for services.
On packaged drinking water, Paswan favoured making the bottles tamper-proof and displaying details like date of manufacturing and expiry on the bottle instead of the current practice of mentioning such information on wrappers.

State-owned  Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) is targeting mid-2018 for start of natural gas production from its Krishna Godavari basin KG-D5 block, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said today.
ONGC is using cluster approach to bring oil and gas finds in the block KG-DWN-98/2 or KG-D5, which sits next to Reliance Industries ' Bay of Bengal block KG-D6, to production by 2018-19, he told Lok Sabha in a written reply to a question. "The block (KG-D5) is divided into the Northern Discovery Area (NDA) and Southern Discovery Area (SDA). Estimated reserves of NDA are 121 million tons of oil inplace and 78 billion cubic meter of initial gas in place and that of SDA are 80.9 bcm of intial gas in place," he said.
ONGC plans to develop the discoveries in the block in three clusters - 14.5 million standard cubic meters per day of gas for 15 years from Cluster-1 comprising of D&E finds of NDA in KG-D5 block and G-4 find in the a neighbouring area.
Cluster-2A mainly comprises of oil finds in NDA. "It is envisaged to drill 14 oil wells and 10 water injectors in this cluster and is expected to produce approx. 31.5 million tonne of oil in 15 years with peak production rate of 91,000 barrels of oil per day," he said.
Cluster 2B, which is made up of four gas finds in NDA, envisages to produce peak production rate of 12.5 mmscmd, with cumulative production of 32.5 bcm of gas in 14 years.
"Efforts to achieve first gas by mid-2018 and first oil by mid-2019 from above clusters are ongoing. Parallel execution of number of project activities are in progress to ensure fast track development of these fields," he said. Pradhan said exercise to identify associated risks and appropriate mitigation measures are also being planned. Cluster-3 is the UD-1 gas discovery in SDA. "Considering the water depth (2400-3200 meters) and the constrained techno-economic solutions, execution of this Cluster-3 is presently not being pursued for development. Scouting for suitable technology/solution for field development is in progress," he said.
ONGC and RIL won KG-D5 and KG-D6 block in the first round of auction under New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) in 2000. RIL began production from the oil discovery in KG-D6 in September 2008 and put gas find on production in April 2009.

How Obama just made immigration reform tougherBy Aaron Blake December 1 Follow @aaronblakewp
President Obama said Tuesday that contributions to the U.S. by a broad patchwork of immigrants help justify the steps he took to protect workers illegally in the country. (AP)
Before President Obama's big move on immigration, the prospects for comprehensive immigration reform in the new Congress were dim. Afterward, they're arguably even dimmer.
Obama's decision to defer deportations for more than 5 million illegal immigrants has divided the American people in half -- and even improved the president's numbers on the immigration issue -- according to new polling from Quinnipiac University and CNN. What it also appears to have done, though, is exacerbated the real problem with getting comprehensive reform done: a very motivated opposition.
This has long been the main obstacle to comprehensive reform -- i.e. some form of legalization of illegal immigrants, plus border security -- and since the executive action, the opposition is on the rise again.
The Q poll shows support for allowing illegal immigrants to apply for citizenship falling to its lowest point since the survey started asking the question two years ago. Fewer than half -- 48 percent -- now support a path to citizenship, down from 57 percent one year ago.
The poll also shows that 35 percent say these immigrants should be required to leave (the word "deportation" is not mentioned). That's a new high, and it's up nine points from the last poll.
And here's the real kicker: The shift is almost completely among Republicans. Although they supported citizenship over deportation 43 to 38 percent in November 2013, today they support deportation/involuntary departure over citizenship, 54 to 27 percent.
That's two to one -- a stunning shift. And if it's even close to accurate, there are very few Republicans in Congress who will be eager to vote for comprehensive reform in the 114th Congress. The fear of primary challenges was already strong enough when the party was split on citizenship and deportation; now it's probably overwhelming (at least in the minds of self-preservation-minded incumbents).
The changes described above, of course, might not be only a result of what Obama did. They also could be influenced by the summer border crisis, for instance. But it's pretty logical to assume that Obama's actions pushed things in this direction (and the border crisis's effect on polling pretty well dissipated in recent months).
The CNN/Opinion Research poll tells a similar tale. Although 42 percent favored the policies that Obama announced and 46 percent opposed them, it was clear where the motivation remains: with the opposition.
CNN also showed people opposed Obama acting to implement those policies on his own, 56 to 41 percent. And when it asked people how they felt about Obama's policy changes on an emotional level, 43 percent were either "angry" or "displeased," while just 31 percent said they were "enthusiastic" or "pleased" -- a 12-point gap. What's more, the "angry" (16 percent) outnumbered the "enthusiastic" (8 percent) by two to one.
There are probably some -- maybe even in the White House -- who had hoped that Obama's executive action on immigration would force the hand of congressional Republicans to act on immigration in the months ahead. "Pass a bill," Obama has intoned repeatedly.
But although it might cause Republicans to pass something immigration-related, the idea that they are suddenly going to be motivated to act on some kind of comprehensive bill with a legalization component remains pretty farfetched. And if their base is indeed moving toward deportation, there's basically no chance.
Obama needed for this move to be a political winner -- something that would make Republicans want a piece of the action when it came to reforming the immigration system.
So far, though, it has revealed just how soft the support for comprehensive immigration reform is. And it has hardened the opposition.

Darren Wilson and guilt by associationBy Jonathan Capehart December 1 Follow @capehartj

Colbert King highlighted something in his Saturday column that leapt off the pages of Darren Wilson’s testimony for me, too. The now- former Ferguson police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown on Aug. 9 was asked about his “relationship with the residents” of the unarmed teenager’s apartment complex. Not only did the prosecutor’s questions strike me as hand-holding, but also Wilson’s broad-brush responses made my skin crawl.
Q: Did you guys have a volatile, well, how can I put this. Did you not really get along well with the folks that lived in that apartment, not you personally, I mean the police in general?
Wilson: It is an antipolice area for sure.
Q: And when you say antipolice, tell me more?
Wilson: There’s a lot of gangs that reside or associate with that area. There’s a lot of violence in that area, there’s a lot of gun activity, drug activity, it is just not a very well-liked community. That community doesn’t like the police.
Q: Were you pretty much on high alert being in that community by yourself, especially when Michael Brown said, ‘[expletive] what you say,’ I think he said?
Wilson: Yes.
Q: You were on pretty high alert at that point knowing the vicinity and the area that you’re in?
Wilson: Yes, that’s not an area where you can take anything really. Like I said, it is a hostile environment. There are good people over there, there really are, but I mean there is an influx of gang activity in that area.
What Wilson said is barely a few moments in his testimony, but its ugliness is in keeping with his overall tone about Brown. That nice bit about there being “good people over there” after trashing the entire community is no antidote to the poisoned opinion of the grand jury.
Alexandra Natapoff  was equally unamused. I had the good fortune of spending Thanksgiving with the associate dean for research and professor of law at Loyola Law School. Natapoff is also an expert on criminal informants and the author of “Snitching: Criminal Informants and the Erosion of American Justice.” Her current work is on misdemeanors and their effect on the criminal justice system, which I will get to in another post because of its connection to Ferguson.
A protester holds a sign of MichaelBrown Jr. after a rally  last August. (Michael B. Thomas/AFP Getty Images)
“In some ways, we can understand Wilson’s response as classic guilt-by-association, and it’s one of the great complaints that African American neighborhoods have had for decades,” Natapoff told me. “Police officers have been told by authorities as high as the Supreme Court that they can draw inferences in high-crime neighborhoods or low-income or urban neighborhoods,” she continued, referring to the 2000 Supreme Court case Illinois v. Wardlow . This has “permitted police to drive devastating conclusions by the mere fact that the young person happens to live there.”
Natapoff then eloquently explained why such guilt-by-association corrodes policing and communities.
When you ask a police officer about his relationship to the residents of a community, in effect you’re asking the police officer what kind of public servant are you? Are you protecting the people of that community? Are you doing your job? And instead Wilson’s answer is an excuse. An excuse for the failure to protect victims in that neighborhood. An excuse for not providing the same level of services and respect and protection that other communities receive. And he does it through guilt by association. He conflates the community and the residents with so-called gangs. And once he does that it’s as if we’re being told that his excuse for not treating Michael Brown as a child and a resident and someone who he is paid by the taxpayers to protect and care for instead that he’s entitled to conflate Michael Brown because of the color of his skin and the neighborhood in which he lives with known criminals. In our system of criminal justice, you’re supposed to be innocent until you’re proven guilty….The idea that Wilson wouldn’t even consider Michael Brown to be one of his charges and one of his constituents and instead immediately associate him with criminals goes to the heart of why we see incidents like this occur.
But Brown did shoplift those cigarillos from a convenience store minutes before his fateful encounter with Wilson. Didn’t guilt-by-association apply in this case? Natapoff’s emphatic response was no.
I don’t know what percentage of American teenagers have taken something from a store that they shouldn’t have taken. But no matter how many lipsticks or cigarillos or packs of gum young people take from a store, it doesn’t make them a criminal gang member. It doesn’t make them a violent offender. And it doesn’t mean the police have the right to treat them as such….It’s absurd to equate a teenager who took at most a couple dollars worth of trinkets from a store with a violent gang member merely because the neighborhood that he lives in and the color of his skin. And by permitting that false association, we permit police officers to use violence against members of the community who couldn’t possibly deserve it. Twenty-five percent of all Americans have a criminal record. Does that mean police officers are justified in shooting a quarter of the population? That can’t possibly be the answer.
Natapoff’s defense of Brown’s neighborhood is as broad as Wilson’s condemnation of it. But I’ll take Natapoff’s view any day. It is more true to our national ideals than the reality presented by Wilson’s unbelievable actions.

Updated at 1:44 p.m.
Protesters laid down in front of the Justice Department’s headquarters on Pennsylvania Avenue NW on Monday afternoon in a protest against the Ferguson, Mo., grand jury decision.
D.C. police said there were no protest-related street closures.
On social media , organizers had called for a nationwide walk-out at 1 p.m. with the motto “Hands Up.”
In the District, a group of about two dozen protesters gathered just after 1 p.m.  in front of the Justice Department. One protester told the crowd, “We must love each other and protect each other! We have nothing to lose but our chains.”

One organizer, Erika Totten, said, “Stand with us or get stuck in traffic.”
Totten, a self-proclaimed soccer mom from Alexandria, said she was arrested Sunday after another Ferguson-related protest on Interstate 395 in the District. She said she felt honored sitting in a jail cell.
Totten said she’s protesting for her young daughter and son.
“I have to worry about someone looking at my baby like they’re a threat,” she said.
She said wears bright colors when she runs now and even asked her husband not to wear a hoodie when he jogs.
“A hoodie on a black body means you are a criminal, a threat. That your death will be justified.”
She said she tells her kids, not to watch out for strangers, but to “watch out for the cops.”
When she heard about Michael Brown’s death in Ferguson, Totten flew there. She said she was tear gassed and shot at for three days.

Gujarat agriculture minister to meet farmer leaders todayRutam Vora
Ahmedabad, Dec 1,
 
Cotton and groundnut farmers from Saurashtra gathered in large number at Rajkot to press for higher minimum support price (MSP) for their produces. Farmers, led by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) held a massive rally, where about 4,000 farmers from the district and nearby region participated.
 
Farmers submitted a memorandum to Rajkot district collector Manisha Chandra, wherein they demanded increase in cotton MSP to Rs 1000 per 20 kg from the current Rs 810 per 20 kg. Similarly, for groundnut, farmers demanded increase in MSP to Rs 1,100 per 20 kg from Rs 900 per 20 kg.
 
"The procurement by government under CCI is slow and insufficient. We have demanded bonus of Rs 200 per 20 kg for cotton and groundnut farmers, only then the prices will be remunerative for farmers," Vitthalbhai Dudhatara, co-general secretary, Guajrat Pradesh - BKS told BusinessLine.
 
According to Dudhatara, MSP should be hiked in accordance with the inflation rate. Also, he demanded incentive for cotton and groundnut exports and restrictions on cotton imports.
 
"We have been called for a meeting with state Agriculture Minister, Babubhai Bokhiria on Tuesday. We are hopeful for some breakthrough after this, else we are prepared for more intense movement," he added.
 
A delegation of 5-6 farmer leaders from across the state will make representation to the minister.

Forensics reveal rat poison in Karnataka school girl deathcaseBy: Express News Service | Bangalore |
Posted: December 1, 2014 8:10 pm
Three levels of toxicology tests on tissue from the body of a 14-year-old school girl who died under mysterious circumstances on October 30 in the town of Thirthahalli, nearly 300 km from Bangalore, has revealed the presence of substances found in rat poison.
The detection of a large quantity of phosphorus from tissue samples in forensic tests — including the advanced inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry test — has strengthened the theory that the young girl committed suicide and was not abducted, assaulted and forced to drink poison.
The death of the 14-year-old girl at the end of October had created a furore in Karnataka after the opposition BJP had accused the ruling Congress party of protecting three Muslim youths allegedly involved in abducting, assaulting and forcing the young girl to consume poison on October 29.
Investigations by the Criminal Investigation Department of the Karnataka police have so far revealed that the young girl committed suicide because she was upset over being transferred to a new school by her parents for the current academic year. The CID probe has found a suicide note written by the young girl to be genuine. The probe has also found no evidence to substantiate allegations that the girl was abducted, assaulted or forced to consume poison as alleged after the case took a political turn.
The CID probe has found that the young girl concocted a story of abduction for her parents after she played truant from school on October 29 and was found alone at a hillock by some locals. The probe has found that a Muslim youth named by the girl was an innocent person.
While poisoning was suspected to be the cause of the death the CID had been awaiting a formal toxicology report to confirm its findings.
Sources said that the presence of a large amount of phosporous in the tissue samples subjected to toxicology tests indicated that the young girl may have consumed a poison meant for rodents. A small store that the girl’s father owned in Thirthahalli had stocks of rat poison and investigators are looking at whether the girl accessed it, sources said.
The Karnataka government is likely to table a report on the probe into the controversial case in the state legislature next week.

US intelligence agencies likely to question ISIS return AreebMajeedBy: Press Trust of India | New Delhi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 7:56 pm | Updated: December 2, 2014 9:23 am
Sleuths of US intelligence agencies are likely to question Areeb Majeed, who returned home after being associated with ISIS in Iraq and Syria, as he is believed to have loads of information about the group running a reign of terror in the region.
Official sources said the US, which is fighting a battle against ISIS, is keen to know about activities of the terrorist group and Areeb could give inputs about the ground situation in the territory the outfit holds on.
Areeb has told interrogators that even though he was a civil engineer, he was deployed to work in Mosul dam as a mason following instructions from some ISIS leaders. He was injured while working at the dam following an aerial attack, the sources said.
The dam is the largest in Iraq and located on the Tigris river. For several weeks in July and August, ISIS held Mosul dam. On August 17, the Kurdish and Iraqi military launched a successful operation to retake control of the dam from ISIS. The US air strikes assisted the Kurdish and Iraqi army.
After his stint at the Mosul dam, Areeb had moved to Rakka or ar-Raqqah, a Syrian town located on the north bank of the Euphrates river, which is now under the control of ISIS. At Rakka, Areeb was given an AK-47 rifle but soon he was injured for the second time due to splinter fire.
During interrogation, Areeb has said that apart from him and three other Mumbai youth, he had met one more Indian-origin youth who joined the ISIS. That youth had come from one of the Gulf countries, the sources said.

Suspended IAS officer withdraws bail application in graftcaseBy: Express News Service | Ahmedabad |
Posted: December 1, 2014 7:56 pm
Suspended IAS officer Pradeep Sharma on Monday withdrew his application from Gujarat High Court seeking bail in the alleged graft case lodged by Gujarat Anti-Corruption Bureau. Sharma is lodged in Bhuj jail for the past two months in the case in which he allegedly misused his official position to gain personal benefits during his tenure as district collector between 2003 and 2006 in Kutch.
The ACB officials arrested Sharma on September 30 following an FIR alleging that the suspended IAS officer allocated land to Welspun Group for establishing units in Anjar taluka of Kutch district in 2004 at rates lower than determined by the district land valuation committee that caused a loss of Rs 1.2 crore to state exchequer.
Sharma has been booked under sections of 11, 13 (1) (D) and 13 (2) Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 among other charges. These sections deal with a public servant abusing his position for pecuniary advantage and a public servant who commits misconduct should be punished with imprisonment for not less than a year up to seven years.
The IAS officer, under suspension for several years, withdrew his application after the prosecution claimed that the investigation is still not completed and releasing him on bail might hamper the case’s progress. After completion of arguments Sharma’s lawyer withdrew the petition.
In the FIR the investigating officer DS Vyas has stated that the action against Sharma was first initiated following a complaint lodged by Henry James Chacko, principal secretary of All India Corruption and Crime Preventive Council in 2010. Sharma had hit headlines after his name figured in the alleged ‘snooping on a woman architect’ controversy broke out last year by two Delhi-based news portals. Apart from this case he is facing five other corruption cases filed by the CID (crime).

(In a fresh blow to UB Group…)
MUMBAI: In another development, Kingfisher Airlines said in an exchange filing on Monday that the corporate affairs ministry has rejected its application to appoint Vijay Mallya as managing director with effect from October 16, 2013.
The cash-strapped Kingfisher Airlines suspended operations in October 2012 after its employees struck work over months of unpaid salaries.
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) subsequently suspended its flying licence after the airline failed to produce a business plan to restart operations. All of Kingfisher's planes and some of its properties have been seized either by leasing companies or banks over constant defaults on loans. The airline's licence will expire at December-end after which it will have to apply for a fresh licence.
The company has already faced actions by stock exchanges for noncompliance to listing agreement as it has failed to submit financial results for the past few quarters and to make other mandatory disclosures.
Besides, minority shareholders of United Spirits had last week rejected several proposals.

Vox Media raises $46.5 million for valuation of $380M
Roger Yu , USA TODAY 4:36 p.m. EST December 1, 2014
10/11/13 11:55:31 AM -- New York, NY, U.S.A  --  Production Assistant Nick Prouty adjusts camera settings in Studio A at Vox Media in New York City as he and another production assistant prepared the studio for an episode of "The War Room" for SBNation.com.

Vox Media, the online media publisher that owns news site Vox.com and sports blog network SB Nation, has raised $46.5 million from investment firm General Atlantic, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The latest round of investment values the media company at about $380 million, the person said, declining to speak publicly due to contractual terms of the investment.
While legacy media companies and newspapers continue to hemorrhage money and slash headcounts, several prominent online media companies, including BuzzFeed, Vox and Vice, have successfully courted investors with new business models that include video, native advertising, branded events and creating fresh ads for corporate clients.
In August, BuzzFeed raised $50 million in investment from venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, propelling its valuation to about $850 million. In comparison, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos bought The Washington Post for $250 million last year, while The New York Times Co.' market value is about $1.95 billion.
"The (General Atlantic) investment is an important milestone," wrote Vox Media CEO Jim Bankoff in a memo to staff Monday. "The investment doesn't change anything. It's about accelerating our momentum."
Vox Media's online properties -- which also include tech news site TheVerge.com, video gaming news site Polygon.com, real estate blog network Curbed, food blog network Eater and fashion-shopping blog site Racked – "engage an audience of over 150 million each month through (its) owned and operated websites," Bankoff said in the memo.
"The Verge, Polygon and SB Nation have each grown at least 70% off big bases," he said.
Vox has been one of the most aggressive and earliest media companies to chase after video advertising spending, and its main sites heavily emphasize video in storytelling and layouts.
Video "will be (its) biggest new editorial investment in 2015," and the company will collaborate with Marques Brownlee , one of the most popular tech gadget reviewers on YouTube, for new content, Bankoff says.
Vox Media plans to invest more in a new division that competes with advertising agencies. Vox Creative sells on the promise that it can create appealing advertising for clients "by extending the same technological, analytical and creative capabilities" that Vox Media uses for its own sites, Bankoff says. Vox announced Monday it hired former Slate vice president Lindsay Nelson to run Vox Creative.
More dollars will also be steered to the continuous development of its publishing and advertising-creation software products, Bankoff says.
In a shot perhaps at competitors that depend heavily on click-bait stories and aggregated content, Bankoff reminded the staff Monday that Vox Media will continue to focus on "long-term sustainability" over "fleeting scale" of traffic by producing what it hopes will be better content.
"Vox Media has never chased algorithms for traffic and we never will," Bankoff wrote. "We've seen the roadkill of companies that gamed the system."
Founded in 2003 as a baseball fan blog about the Oakland Athletics, Vox Media ventured into general news earlier this year when it signed former Washington Post writer Ezra Klein to launch a news explainer site that now carries its main brand name, Vox.com. The 7-month old site has "a monthly global audience of over 20 million," Bankoff says.
Vox Media doesn't publicly release financial figures. In late 2012, Forbes estimated the company's revenue at about $25 million. Bankoff told USA TODAY in September 2013 that Vox's revenue has doubled from a year earlier.
Citing "knowledgeable estimates," the Washington Post reported that Vox Media's revenue exceeded $30 million in 2013.

In a fresh blow to UB Group chief Vijay Mallya, the government has rejected an application by  Kingfisher Airlines to re-appoint him as Managing Director.
Kingfisher, which had to be grounded in October 2012 due to severe financial crunch, had sought the Corporate Affairs Ministry's approval for Mallya's re-appointment for a period of fiver-year beginning October 16, 2013 "without remuneration".
The company has already faced actions by stock exchanges for non-compliance to listing agreement as it has failed to submit financial results for the past few quarters and to make other mandatory disclosures.
The airline said in a regulatory filing that its application has been rejected for re-appointing Mallya as MD. No specific reason could be immediately ascertained for the rejection.
The disclosure comes on a day, when another UB Group firm Mangalore Chemicals and Fertilizers announced Mallya's resignation as a director without giving any reason.
Besides, minority shareholders of United Spirits had last week rejected several proposals including those about dealings of the company with Mallya, whose group has sold controlling stake to British liquor giant Diageo.
Mallya is already engaged in legal tussle with several lenders who are trying to recover their loans amounting to thousands of crores of rupees from Kingfisher and some of them have also declared the UB Group chairman as a willful defaulter.
The Group has sold stakes in some other ventures as well including brewery business and a sports venture.
Kingfisher shares incidentally today rose by about five per cent to Rs 1.34. The company currently commands a market value of about Rs 100 crore, as against a high of over Rs 10,000 crore before troubles began at the airline in late 2012.
Mallya is Chairman and Managing Director of the airline, while it has been without a CEO ever since Sanjay Agarwal left the company early this year.
The airlines is already under regulatory scanner for alleged accounting lapses.
Kingfisher Air stock price
On November 28, 2014, Kingfisher Airlines closed at Rs 1.34, up Rs 0.00, or 0.00 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 5.22 and the 52-week low was Rs 1.26.
The latest book value of the company is Rs -166.59 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company was -0.01.

13 CRPF personnel killed in encounter with Maoists13 CRPF personnel killed in encounter with Maoists
Press Trust of India | Raipur Dec 01, 2014 06:33 PM IST
Thirteen CRPF personnel, including two officers, were today killed while an equal number were injured in an encounter with Maoists in the Naxal hotbed of Sukma in Chhattisgarh.
According to preliminary reports reaching the force's headquarters here, a squad of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel was undertaking operations in Kasanpara village of the district in the south Bastar region when they entered into an encounter with the Maoists at around 1030 A.M.
The engagement, a senior officer said, continued till 1400 hours with casualties occurring on both sides.
The officer said that the Maoists fired at the CRPF patrol party taking the aid of locals and villagers and hence the force had to fire with restraint.
Most of the troops suffered bullet injuries and have been air-lifted to Jagdalpur and the state capital here for treatment.
"Two officers, one in the rank of Deputy Commandant and an Assistant Commandant, have been killed while over a dozen personnel have been injured," the officer said, adding that the squad was in the jungles for the last 10 days to carry out operations.
Incidentally, five CRPF personnel were injured last week in the same area in an encounter with Maoists.
Reinforcements are being sent to the area and the offensive by security forces is being led by CRPF Inspector General (Chhattisgarh), HS Sidhu.

With the Consumer Price Index falling to 5.5% in the month of October, below the Central Banks 6% target by January 2016, there is growing pressure on the RBI to stimulate growth by cutting interest rates. 
While, monetary policy is a conventional tool to boost investment growth, a new study from Crisil says that a rate cut right now may not spur growth significantly. Arguing that the current slowdown is largely due to “government policy and slowing domestic demand”, the report says that “a reversal of policy at this juncture could jeopardize the recent gains on inflation.” 
Examining two different time periods, the high growth phase between 2004 and 2008 and the last two financial years of sub 5% growth, the report presents data to drive home the point that investment growth, particularly private corporate investment, plummeted in fiscal years 2013 and 2014 despite low real interest rates. During 2013 and 2014, the real policy rate which is essentially the repo rate minus retail inflation measured by the consumer price index was negative, while real lending rates averaged 2.4%. This was significantly lower than the 7.4% estimated during the years between 2004 and 2008. But despite the lower rates, investment growth fell sharply from 16.2% in the pre crisis years to 0.3%. Thus, making the case for a status quo on monetary policy, the report says that it was the combination of policy uncertainty and a sharp slowdown in domestic demand that slowed investments rather than the level of interest rates. 
According to Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Care ratings, “Demand continues to remain weak as witnessed in the IIP data. As capacity utilization rates continue to remain low, an increase in demand could be met by raising capacity utilization levels. This means that there is no incentive to launch new investments. Consumption will rise only when inflation comes down.” 
The Crisil report also points out that high inflation, “By discouraging consumption demand, eroding export competitiveness and raising input costs for corporates, has made the situation worse.” 
But while inflation as measured by CPI has come down sharply over the past few months, economists expect the recent moderation in inflation to be transitory in nature due to the base effect and with continued uncertainty on the impact of a deficient monsoon on agricultural production. 
Further, household inflation expectations continue to remain elevated. As higher inflation expectations drive up inflation which in turn reinforces the expectations, pursing a tight monetary policy to curb household inflation expectations which have been deeply entrenched, is being advocated. 
On the other side of the debate is economist Surjit Bhalla, who writing in the Indian Express argues that “at least in India, monetary policy has had precious little effect on inflation”, RBI should cut interest rates to stimulate growth. 
While there exists a sharp divide among economists on RBI’s stance on monetary policy, on the degree to which a loose monetary policy can propel growth in the current environment, Sabnavis, argues that “A lower interest rate regime can stimulate investment growth to the extent that high cost of financing is a deterrent for certain infrastructure projects. A company that wants to issue a long term bond to finance its infrastructure project may want to wait for lower interest rates, which could delay fresh investments.” 
But, according to Aditi Nayar, senior economist at ICRA, “Higher interest rates are not the binding constraint to growth in several sectors. While a rate cut would boost sentiment and ease pressure on debt servicing, it may not translate into a major revival of growth unless issues related to land acquisition, labour issues and specific concerns for the coal and power sectors are addressed.” 
As a majority of the projects which have been cleared by the Project Management group (PMG) belong to the power and coal sectors which remain engulfed in policy uncertainty, lower interest rates may not spur investment in these sectors. 
The Central Bank is expected to continue with the tight monetary policy stance till the first quarter of the next financial year, by when inflation would probably be firmly under control. Thus, the government must bear the burden of boosting growth by improving the policy environment. 

Weathering a stock market correction0
A pullback is mild. It might make you nervous as the damage is being inflicted to your money, but it will blow over quickly. You might lose 5 to 9 percent of your money, but the losses will heal quickly. Within a few weeks you might not even remember that it happened. By the end of the year if you look over your 401(k) or IRA, the short-term losses on your money probably will be indiscernible.
That's true of a correction too, although when you are in the midst of one, it will be scarier and you will wonder if it will become more destructive for your money. In a correction, you temporarily lose 10 to 20 percent of your money, maybe over a couple of months. But on average you are back to even in four months, according to Standard & Poor's research.
The trouble with a correction, however, is that you never know exactly when it will be over, and a correction can morph into a bear market. The stock market storm to fear is called a bear market. It causes tremendous damage and lasts a long time. In the case of the 2007-09 bear market, stock market investors lost about 55 percent of their money and didn't recover what they'd lost for about five years.
Keep in mind that even in that horrific period, investors did recover, and between the worst point of 2009 and the recent past, investors enjoyed tremendous gains of more than 150 percent on money that remained invested.
Most bear markets aren't nearly as bad as the one from 2007 to 2009. According to research by the Leuthold Group, investors lose about 38 percent in the average bear market. The median time to return to even is two years and three months. And over years of investing, the person who sticks it out ends up fine even though bear markets show up on average about every four years.
The thought of having to go through corrections and bear markets sometimes makes people think they should simply skip the stock market. But history has a way of papering over the distress. The stock market climbs much more than it falls, because it's a reflection of the U.S. economy, which tends to mostly move forward despite some recessions.
So if you go back to 1929 and calculate how a person invested in the stock market would have done if they'd enjoyed the good times and lasted out the bear markets, corrections and pullbacks, they would have earned on average about 10 percent a year.
As a result, financial advisers typically tell people to keep all money out of the stock market if they will need to spend it within five years. But if they have the protection of cash and bonds, they don't need to flee stocks or stock mutual funds during a correction. Consider the person with $10,000 invested — half in the stock market and half in Treasury bonds — during the horrible bear market of 2007-09. By the ugliest period in 2009, only $7,780 of the original $10,000 would have remained. But as the healing took place, the money grew. By March 2012, they would have had about $12,945.
Since guessing exactly when that healing will take place is impossible for even the savviest analysts, financial advisers typically tell people with a large chunk of money to invest in a downturn to take their time. They won't know when the correction will be over. But if the person does dollar-cost averaging — or putting a portion of the money into a stock fund every week or month for an extended time — they will ease the bite if the correction continues. If the stock market declines, each week the allocation of dollar-cost average money will buy more stock for less money. If the stock market ends its correction and starts climbing, the investor's money will be in the mutual fund, set up to make gains.
"Everyone tries to time the market and it's very hard to do," says John Kosar, research director at Asbury Research. "Keep some powder dry," investing a little at a time.

New website launches for people who love old homesPeter: After the eureka moment, we realized this wasn't just about real estate — it's a lifestyle. There are millions of people like us who want to stay in historic hotels or stay in a restored cottage. It's a natural segue.
Q: How do you define historic?
Meggen: We're including anything 50 years of age and older. We decided to start with homes built no later than 1965. We love midcentury design, and we know lots of other people do to, so we set that as the starting point.
Q: As you're well aware, you're up against the for-sale listings giants like Trulia.com and realtor.com . And the vacation-rental leaders like homeaway.com and vrbo.com dominate that market. Recognizing that what you've created here is intended to be a relatively narrowly defined boutique marketplace, one still has to wonder how you can compete with the big guys.
Peter: A lot of the big real estate sites are very opaque. There are a lot of upcharges and extra fees, or they don't publish their pricing. We set up our pricing structure to be simple and straightforward — $25 per month or $250 per year for agents or other people listing their properties for sale or rent, but we also offer package pricing. You're not booking through us and paying us a commission when the property gets rented. We connect you directly with the owner or agent. You don't have to register with the site. We have listings from some of the premiere brokerage firms around the country, and we're expanding internationally.
And, of course, we have the travel component. Subscribers can post information about their historic restaurant, spa, winery or hotel, or even their historic retail or renovation businesses. We're concentrating now on reaching out to historic hotels, bed-and-breakfasts and restaurants, and we're expanding into Europe, South America, Asia, Australia and New Zealand.
Q: So who are house people, anyway? Can you define who they are?
Peter: In our research that led to developing the site, we decided there are two broad audiences. One group just loves these properties, they love the architectural features and the stories behind the homes. Those are our targeted consumers. But there's a much broader market that's a potential audience, of younger people, millennials. This generation hasn't given as much thought to old homes, and if you asked them what they like about them, they probably can't put their finger on it as well as older people can, beyond saying they're drawn to older homes' character. They're one reason we're reaching out to historic-preservation groups, because these groups need to attract younger people. We allow historic preservation groups to have a presence on the site for free. At the moment, we have about 20 groups featured on the site, and we're working with about half a dozen more, to promote their activities.

Blackout of Bulls  Blackhawks for 342 000 Dish subscribers loomingBlackout of Bulls, Blackhawks for 342,000 Dish subscribers looming
Dish Network
Hey sports fans: There's no guarantee Dish will carry Bulls, Blackhawks starting next week.
Analyst says Dish is “done” with regional sports networks.
When the Chicago Bulls host the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday night, speculation will run rampant over how much injury-plagued superstar Derrick Rose will play.
Hundreds of thousands of Chicago-area Dish Network subscribers may have a bigger question: Where is the game?
Comcast SportsNet Chicago, which is carrying the game, is perhaps days from being blacked out by the satellite provider in a dispute over license fees. The current agreement expires Monday and Dish Network is balking at an increase demanded by CSN.
At stake is CSN Chicago's slate of Bulls, Blackhawks, White Sox and Cubs games and its other sports programming, a local fan staple for 10 years. Dish has more than 342,000 subscribers in the Chicago area who would be affected by such a blackout, according to media research firm SNL Kagan.
The dispute also involves CSN Mid-Atlantic (Washington and Baltimore area), CSN Bay Area (San Francisco-Oakland) and CSN California (Northern California and parts of Oregon and Nevada), all of which may be dropped by Dish next week.
The two sides appear to be at an impasse, with increasingly divergent positions being argued through the media as Monday's deadline for a deal approaches. CSN started an on-air campaign last week warning viewers of the looming blackout to enlist their support in negotiations with Dish. Tens of thousands of customers have expressed concern, according to executives.
Colorado-based Dish, which has 14 million satellite subscribers and a history of playing hardball with regional sports networks, seems unfazed by potential fan backlash.

"Comcast SportsNet is demanding a 40 percent price increase for more than 90 percent of Dish customers in each of the affected markets, when only a small fraction of those consumers actually watch the channels," Dish said in a statement.
Sources familiar with the negotiations say NBCUniversal, which operates the regional sports networks after being acquired by Comcast last year, may be seeking closer to a 10 percent increase across the four markets.
"We are seeking to license our regional sports networks to Dish on the same terms that other distributors have accepted for this programming," NBCUniversal said in a statement. "Our rates are reflective of the very high value of this programming, a value that is recognized by consumers through the increased ratings for these (regional sports networks)."
Launched in 2004, CSN Chicago is a partnership among Comcast and the Bulls, Blackhawks, White Sox and Cubs. Comcast owns about 30 percent of the sports network, the teams control the rest. CSN Chicago has never been blacked out by a cable satellite provider.
Most of CSN Chicago's revenue comes from fees paid by cable and satellite providers including Comcast, RCN Cable, DirecTV and Dish Network. Advertising provides a secondary revenue stream.
Sports networks have traditionally garnered the highest license fees among cable networks. Live game broadcasts are perhaps the only DVR-proof programming, making sports content extremely valuable, according to industry analysts. ESPN tops all cable networks in affiliate revenue, getting average monthly fees of $6.04 per subscriber, according to SNL Kagan, with Turner Broadcasting's TNT, whose programming includes the NBA, a distant second at $1.44 per subscriber.
Regional sports networks also skew higher in affiliate revenue. CSN Chicago gets average monthly fees of $3.25 per subscriber, which ranks 11th among regional sports networks, according to SNL Kagan. CSN Mid-Atlantic ranks second at $4.60 per subscriber, while CSN Bay Area is fifth at $3.53 per subscriber.
There are signs that cable sports subscribers fees may be peaking. SportsNet LA, a regional sports network launched this year by Time Warner Cable and the Los Angeles Dodgers, was blacked out to nearly two-thirds of local viewers for the entire baseball season because other cable and satellite providers refused to pay a higher premium.
SportsNet LA gets an average monthly fee of $4.00 per subscriber, according to SNL Kagan.
Dish is the third-largest pay-TV provider in the U.S. behind Comcast and DirecTV. Comcast has more than 22 million subscribers, according to SNL Kagan.
Dish has been embroiled in several high-profile carriage disputes recently, dropping Turner Broadcasting's CNN and Turner Classic Movies in October, and threatening to black out TBS and TNT before reaching a short-term agreement last week to restore all of the channels while negotiations continued.
Dish avoided a similar blackout of CBS-owned stations with a short-term extension last week. On Tuesday, CBS issued a statement saying "a short-term extension into next week has been granted while negotiations continue."
Positioned as a value-priced service, Dish has shown a willingness to hold the line on cable network license fees, especially when dealing with regional sports networks. In August, Dish dropped CSN New England completely after a series of extensions failed to resolve a carriage dispute.
In 2010, Dish dropped the MSG Network from its lineup when no deal was reached after the expiration of their carriage agreement. MSG remains dark and Dish doesn't carry any of the four regional sports networks in New York.
"They've always been kind of the low-price multichannel service and I just think they believe there's a market there for packages that don't have the regional sports networks," said Derek Baine, a senior media analyst with SNL Kagan.
Baine said history suggests any blackout of CSN Chicago by Dish could be more than a temporary inconvenience for local sports fans.
"They've dropped quite a few (regional sports networks)," Baine said. "It's not a negotiating strategy. They're done with them."

Tough Texas gets results by going softer on crimeThe number inmates inside Texas prisons is declining. (Photo by Todd Spoth for The Washington Post)
AUSTIN — When it comes to crime, Texas has a reputation.
Since the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976, Texas has executed more convicts than the next six states combined. More than 1 in 10 prisoners in the United States are incarcerated in the state, with the prison population there nearly tripling since 1992.
Tough on crime talk never went out of style here. But now Texas is drawing the spotlight for a very different incarceration trend.
A series of reforms implemented seven years ago has reversed the explosive growth of the inmate population. Now, the home of the most active death row in America is the model other states are looking to for ways to reduce their crime rate.
The genesis of all the good news came from a very grim time.
The number of inmates in Texas prisons skyrocketed during the 1990s and 2000s, when the war on drugs was in full swing and crime rates were high. The population grew from about 50,000 in 1990 to a peak of 173,000 in 2010, according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, a 346 percent increase. At the same time, the U.S. prison population doubled, to 1.5 million.
Texas couldn’t build prisons fast enough to accommodate the growing number of inmates. The state began shipping some to county prisons. Private, for-profit prisons sprang up to handle the overflow.
During Gov. Ann Richards’s (D) administration, the state built 100,000 new beds. But by 2006, even those beds were full. That year, Texas Department of Criminal Justice director Brad Livingston approached state legislators with a problem: Outside observers were projecting the state’s prison population would grow by 15,000 inmates in the following six years. He would need $523 million to build a sufficient number of prison beds to house those new inmates.
Livingston had strong relationships with the men he was asking for money.
State Sen. John Whitmire (D), the longest-serving member of the Texas legislature, had authored the penal code that sent the inmate population soaring in the 1990s.
State Rep. Jerry Madden (R), Whitmire’s counterpart in the House, was known as a conservative good ol’ boy with an affinity for law and order.
But Whitmire and Madden knew that the appropriations request would lead down an expensive road. The new prisons would have to be staffed, an ongoing expense added to an already bloated prison budget that was eating up huge amounts of state revenue.
Then-State House Speaker Tom Craddick (R), too, wanted an alternative to the seemingly endless expansion of beds.
So instead of authorizing the new prisons, Whitmire and Madden called in a third expert, Tony Fabelo, a 20-year veteran of the Texas Criminal Justice Policy Council whose job had been eliminated three years earlier by Gov. Rick Perry (R).
Fabelo, a native Cuban and Ph.D., knew more about the Texas criminal justice system than just about anyone in the state.
Craddick gave them an unlikely mandate: Bend the growth curve downward. In a time before Twitter, in a sleepy state capital, Whitmire, Madden and Fabelo were given the privacy to build their plan behind closed doors.
Fabelo, who was working without pay, recalled late-night meetings in Whitmire’s and Madden’s offices.
In the end, they asked for about half the amount TDCJ wanted.
And instead of building new prisons, the trio built a treatment system. To counter the huge number of former inmates who returned to jail after violating parole, they created hundreds of new beds in drug treatment programs with names like the In-Prison Therapeutic Treatment and Substance Abuse Felony Punishment Facilities.
Some probation violators could be sent to intermediate sanction facilities, a step lower than prison, aimed at getting an offender’s attention without locking them up.
More slots were set aside in outpatient treatment programs for criminals sentenced to probation.
Pre-trial diversion programs for those suffering from mental illnesses, overseen by officers who specialize in mental health and drug treatment helped more people avoid jail.
Crucially, the reforms gave prosecutors who recommend sentences and the judges who impose them a third option besides prison or parole — and it gave them confidence in TDCJ’s ability to impose those alternative penalties.
“In order for the judges and prosecutors to have confidence in that system for the long haul, you have to have the resources. You have to have the outpatient substance abuse resources, you have to have intermediate sanction facility resources,” Livingston said in an interview.
There was a “deliberate decision,” he said, to have a range of programs that would reduce the likelihood released inmates would make a return trips to prison.
The final package ran into its share of political hurdles.
Madden, Whitmire and Fabelo knew they couldn’t change sentencing laws, a poison pill that would have opened legislators to accusations of being soft on crime. And Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst (R), who nurtured his own future ambitions, inserted a rider that would have required new prisons to be constructed if the number of inmates continued to rise.
Seven years later, that rider has not been triggered. The number of inmates has dropped from its peak, down to 168,000 in 2013. In 2011, the state legislature voted to close a prison in Sugar Land, near Houston, the first time Texas had shut down a prison in 166 years.
And the state’s crime rate has fallen dramatically. Even recidivism is down, from 28 percent before the reforms took effect to 22.6 percent, according to the most recent data.
Those involved in the reforms, and public policy analysts watching the results, say no one program is responsible for the improvement.
“None of these things by themselves will have a huge impact,” Fabelo said in an interview. It’s the combination of multiple reforms, he said, that’s created a stable system – an approach that’s saved the state an estimated $3 billion to date.
“They funded programs rather than prisons,” said Adam Gelb, director of the Public Safety Performance Project at the Pew Charitable Trusts.
Some criminal justice experts say that while Texas is off to a good start, it’s far from finished fixing the deeper structural problems caused by so much incarceration.
Michele Deitch, a senior lecturer at the Lyndon Baines Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, says lawmakers will need to revisit sentencing guidelines after all.
“The prison population is determined by two things: How many people go in the front door, and how long they stay,” Deitch said. “I think we need to be asking ourselves why we still feel this pull toward incredibly long sentences.”
Tackling sentencing guidelines will be politically difficult in a state where a reduction in the prison population isn’t automatically viewed as a winning message: Perry didn’t mention the lower crime rate or the reduced prison population at all during his 2012 presidential campaign.
But after years of explosive growth, the early returns suggest the tantalizing prospect that the growth curve is bending downward. Other states are starting to pay attention — and the fact that Texas was the first state to invest so aggressively in reforms can give legislators in other states the cover they need to tackle their own reforms.
“The Texas story has resonated loudly across the country,” Gelb said. “There is a deep, visceral reaction to the fact that Texas has taken a different path when it comes to crime and punishment.”

Gasoline falls below $3 a gallon in Chicago area37
"So having lower gas prices is really great for us," Crowe, 47 said, adding that she's also saving on gas for the family's transportation. "We're a family of six. You have to have a pretty big car for that."
Her daughter, Katie, moved to St. Louis last month and said gas was $2.42 a gallon when she left to come visit Chicago this week.
Prices for gasoline have been falling, and on Friday continued their downward trend after oil-exporting countries refused on Thursday to cut output and slow the drop in oil prices.
"It means that, for the foreseeable future, gas prices will continue to be this low barring anything unforeseen," AAA-Chicago spokeswoman Beth Mosher said Friday.
FuelGaugeReport.com on early Friday showed that a gallon of regular gasoline in the Chicago area cost an average of $2.995, down from $3.003 the previous day and $3.070 a week ago.
Prices also are down in the Chicago area from a month ago and a year ago.
Nationally, a gallon of regular gasoline averaged $2.792 on Friday, down from $2.799 the prior day and $2.839 a week ago. Those prices are also less than what U.S. motorists were paying a month ago and a year ago.
The AAA Daily Fuel Gauge Report, which surveys up to 120,000 gas stations daily, is run by the travel membership group and is updated daily by Oil Price Information Service, an industry pricing and news provider, with average national, state and local prices for gasoline and other fuels.
In the city of Chicago, the average price for a regular gallon of gasoline was $3.253 as of Friday, according to FuelGaugeReport.com. That was down from $3.255 the prior day. Gasoline prices in the city are also down from a week ago, a month ago, and a year ago.
The decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on Thursday to not cut production is likely to usher in continued price reductions at the pump for consumers, said Patrick DeHaan, senior petroleum analyst in the Midwest for GasBuddy.com, a provider of retail fuel pricing information.
As of Friday afternoon, GasBuddy.com was showing that the average price in the Chicago area was $3.011 a gallon.
DeHaan said there could be an additional price drop of 10 cents to 20 cents a gallon over coming weeks.
Crude oil accounts for about two-thirds of the cost of a gallon of gasoline, he said.
The drop in oil prices has been triggered by factors including rising U.S. output from hydraulic fracturing, a method of injecting water, sand and chemicals at high pressure to extract oil and gas from shale rock deposits. In response, OPEC has decided to keep pumping to maintain market share against the fracking rivals.

AT&T s--REDACTED--to the FCC s Requests about--REDACTED--Fiber Optic Deployment--REDACTED.According to the FCC :
"On November 12, 2013, AT&T Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer Randall L. Stephenson stated that the Company would limit its fiber deployment to the "2 million additional homes" that are "commitments to the DirecTV announcement" and that any other fiber deployment would depend on the outcome of the Commission's Open Internet Proceeding."
And the FCC actually called AT&T's bluff and asked to see the deployment plans.
AT&T responded : The public doesn't really need to know the details.  We'll just redact everything and supply blank pieces of paper for the public.
At the bottom of this page we find a footnote to the missing information.
It states that the numbers presented do not represent 'homes' but "locations", which includes businesses. But it also says that, well, technologies continue to change so the deployments may not be fiber-to-the home, (FTTP), but fiber-to-the-node, (FTTN). I.e., AT&T is including U-Verse, which is a copper-to-the-home network using the existing legacy copper wires and the fiber optics wire are somewhere within ½ mile from the actual location.
Amusingly, according to Re/code and others, last week AT&T stated that it was only kidding about not doing the fiber deployment. Re/code's headline says it all "AT&T Says It Still Plans to Expand High-Speed Internet in DirecTV Acquisition."
And should we trust AT&T? Of course we should. They are the phone company!
If I was cynical I would say that AT&T didn't want the FCC to actually audit their commitments in detail as they were just kidding all along and made up the deployment announcement and plans, just like they have done in the past. And while in some articles AT&T claims to have completed Austin Texas, upgrading it with fiber optic 'Gigapower', Stop the Cap and others detail that customers in Austin have had problems getting the reported speeds or that they can't get the service.
Should we believe AT&T's 'commitment' to rewire cities with fiber optics? In a previous article "AT&T's Top 13 Broken Promises. DIRECTV Merger? 'Giga'-Me-a-Break!" we highlight 13 'broken promises' (and we are calling for investigations of AT&T's previous commitments). For example, in the DirecTV-AT&T merger it was revealed that 25% of  customers in AT&T's 22 states can not get broadband and yet, in the AT&T-BellSouth merger, AT&T claims that it fulfilled the obligation to have 100% of their territory capable of broadband (albeit slow at 200kbps in 1 direction). Where's the investigation by the FCC of this discrepancy?
The article supplies the statements and filings so that you, the reader, can corroborate what we found.
For a full discussion see the new book: "The Book of Broken Promises: $400 Billion Broadband Scandal & Free the Net".
To Summarize:
1) AT&T-Bellsouth Merger was to have 100% of 22 States Capable of at Least Minimal Broadband Speeds by 2007. It would appear that 25% didn't get upgraded.
2) SBC Was to Compete for Wireline Service Out-of-Region in 30 Cities by 2002 -- Never happened.
The Mergers Killed the Fiber Optic Deployments in America.
Then we have the closing of fiber optic broadband deployments that were underway in almost every state SBC (now-AT&T) took over.
3) Pacific Telesis -- was to spend $16 billion on 5.5. million homes in California by 2000. After the merger in 1997, SBC shut down everything being built and never spent about $15 billion.
4) SNET, Connecticut -- was to spend $4.5 billion and have 100% of the state completed by 2007; SNET started rolling out cable services over fiber in 1996 and after the merger everything was abandoned, starting around 1998.
5,6,7,8, 9) Ameritech -- claimed it would have 6 million households wired by 2000. Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin all had commitments to build out fiber optic networks, and some states included schools and libraries. Cable services were rolled out and after the merger with SBC, all of the fiber optic networks were sold off to WOW.
10) In Texas, one of SBC's (Southwestern Bell) original states, committed to spending $1.1 billion on educational institutions, etc., as part of projects funded by the Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund -- with speeds 45 Mbps, starting in 1995, and had made commitments to supply fiber optics to some communities -- never happened.
11) Closing the Networks to Competition -- Promise Them 100 Mbps Fiber Optics in 2002. In order to close the networks to direct competition, which were opened under the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that allowed Internet, broadband and even cable competitors to offer service using the in-place (or what were to be upgraded wires), then-SBC told the FCC that it would roll out 100 Mbps fiber-to-the-home services if only the FCC got rid of those pesky competitors.
12) Re-verse: The "Copper-to-the-Home" Service -- As soon as the ink was dry on the closing of the networks, AT&T announced they were doing 'fiber-based services', which was a euphemism for-- a 'copper-to-the-home' service, with fiber optics in a box within ½ mile of the location.
13) AT&T's Press Release: "AT&T Eyes 100 U.S. Cities and Municipalities for its Ultra-Fast Fiber Network." -- In this latest round of using broadband as a 'carrot' to push through the AT&T DirecTV merger and get more deregulation, AT&T's new plan includes "GigaPower", fiber optic-based cities.
However, when we checked the press release of the cities that were being discussed to be upgraded, we found only 1, Austin Texas, was serving customers as of April 21 2014.
And about Texas; SBC (now-AT&T) claimed in a July 1996 press release that they would have 47,000 homes in Richardson Texas with fiber optic services in 1996.
"SBC is building a traditional cable network in Richardson, Texas that will be in service in the fourth quarter of this year (1996). It also is constructing a broadband network that will allow the company to offer cable and interactive services to up to 47,000 Dallas area households in 1996."
Conclusion: AT&T must be investigated for its previous failures to fulfill basic commitments in prior mergers, especially the AT&T-BellSouth merger and the FCC should audit the new proposed fiber optic plans, not just take AT&T's word for it. And the states should go back and examine whether customers have been paying extra for decades for these upgrades based on commitments never fulfilled.
Let the investigations begin. I leave you with the last redacted page of AT&T's FCC filing.

Picking Experts and the Quest for Great Weight Loss SurgeryBetween pleasure and pain"
-Samantha Fox
I'm a big believer in experts. The fastest way to irritate me is to say (usually via a voice mail recording), "Any of our fine professionals will be able to assist you." Big corporations like that concept as it allows them to treat employees like throwaway parts.  Customers don't develop a personal relationship with staff member s and the corporation is able to promote their brand more than the people who make up that brand.
A life of experience has taught me to connect with the very best experts I can find. In every form of endeavor there is always a handful of experts whose results dwarf others in the same category.
For example, I've been in the structured settlement business for 33 years and can demonstrate over and over again the difference between a good lawyer, a great lawyer, a mediocre lawyer and a bad one.
A good lawyer will get you a good settlement or jury verdict. A great one will usually get a great settlement. A mediocre one earns an okay result and a bad lawyer may get you zero. Or get you thrown in jail.
I had a stretch several years ago when I worked on nine different death cases involving trucks slamming into a car at the exact same intersection. The road was poorly designed and eventually corrected, but each of the nine people that were killed had similar demographics.
Each lived in the same neighborhood. Each was hit by a truck running a stop light. Each death  was an individual driver without passengers, and each accident happened in the early morning when the sun was in the truck driver's eyes and the passenger was on their way to work. I don't remember any of the drivers drinking or taking drugs.
All of settlements were confidential, but I was there for the mediations and settlement conferences. Most of the families of the victims had mediocre lawyers and received about $400,000. One had a good lawyer who got about $600,000, and the one who had a superstar attorney received a settlement in the millions.
That family had a true expert. The rest were operating on a system of "any attorney will do" and never knew they could have had 500 percent more.
I can't imagine a more important expert than a doctor. They literally have your life in their hands and a decision they make can have an overwhelming impact on the quality of your life.
I've made it a point to really get to know any medical professional in my life, from the receptionist in my physician's office to every nurse, assistant and other person in the process. An expert can solve a problem that another cannot. Usually they attract good people around them too.
Let's not forget that most aspects of the medical profession are run by big corporations.  Thus, most buy into the "any of our staff members will do" approach. It's mostly about money. If doctors become interchangeable parts, it's easier to pay them less and replace them with another without losing customers or market share.
In the bariatric surgery field, the  marketing focus is on the facility and not the physician. The facility has massive advertising budgets and public relations experts, and the doctor normally does not.
The American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery has a program called the Bariatric Surgery Center of Excellence. It is an excellent idea to weed out surgeons who "dabble" in weight loss surgery from full-time professionals, but the focus is on the hospital and not on the surgeon. The federal government pays for many weight loss surgeries through Medicare, Medicaid and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and their rules revolve around facilities not surgeons.   Any hospital receiving Medicare and Medicaid money has to be a Level 1 Bariatric Surgery Center or a Center of Excellence.
The mindset of the federal government  is the opposite of what BLIS does when it insures surgeries.  BLIS is only focused on the surgeon and not the facility.
So who is right?
Being at a Center of Excellence was definitely a consideration for me. There was no way I would be at a facility that did not have that professional standard, but it was a first step and not an only step.
Being a Center of Excellence is an incredible marketing opportunity for the hospital. Ultimately it will, and probably should, result in an outcome where no one but Centers of Excellence can make it in the bariatric business. On the other hand, hospitals can make their reputation on a great run with one set of surgeons, replace them with a lesser group and still maintain their Center of Excellence standing in the short run.
You see an analogy in the financial business. Fidelity had an incredible run with its Magellan mutual fund when Peter Lynch was managing the fund. They moved Lynch to Vice Chairman, which was a dark time in Fidelity's history as the company got into questionable practices like peddling contractual mutual funds with 50 percent commissions to soldiers fighting in the Iraq War. Congress shut down that practice, but in the meantime, Fidelity kept advertising the incredible returns on the Magellan fund long after Lynch was gone.
Fidelity is one of the most aggressive, but a lot of financial  companies do it. The line "past performance is no guarantee of future results" is not just a disclaimer; it is a mantra for how many corporations market. Including hospitals.
I am happy to be having my surgery at a Center of Excellence, but even happier that Dr. Derek Weiss is the one performing the surgery.
"I can call you Betty
And Betty, when you call me
You can call me Al"
-Paul Simon
I've known a lot of doctors in my life. My mother spent 27 years as an operating room nurse and for my first years in the financial business, all of my clients were doctors. I've learned a lesson about doctors that holds true for almost  any professional: the less pretentious they are, the better doctor they are.
People hide behind titles are not people I want to do business with. Usually informal people have more self-confidence and the ability to allow others to buy into their self-belief.
Titles do have a purpose and I let you know about all of mine.  I put all of my professional initials behind my name as it is a shorthand way to let people know that I've been to the rodeo and know what I am doing.
On the other hand,  I want you to call me  Don.   My three grandchildren are the only people who refer to me by a title and "grandpa" is the title I've earned.
G. Derek Weiss, MD, FACS, FASMBS is "Derek," not Dr. Weiss. He introduces himself as Derek and prefers it that way. He is friendly but oozes with self-confidence.  He is an easy guy to like.
Few medical professionals like to interviewed by the media and  having a patient is writing a book about their  performance can be nerve-racking. The facility where I am having the procedure DOES NOT (let me repeat DOES NOT) want to be mentioned in my writing and since I am a guest in their hospital, I am doing my best to accommodate them.
Derek is the opposite. He's done three interviews with me and spent three hours on a Sunday afternoon answering a plethora of questions, from hardballs to softballs.   His answers were 100% dead on and honest.
When you are a journalist or work with trial attorneys, you can get skeptical and cynical.  I do both.   You  see people's worst sides.   It's extremely hard to win me over, but Derek has. I buy into his confidence that things will go smoothly and I will be well on my way to better health.  I'm three days from the surgery but anticipating it like a child waiting for Santa Claus.   I can't wait to it rolling and get my second chance at life started.
Derek is a man of strong opinions and not afraid to clash with those who disagree with his thoughts and beliefs. I've interviewed several of his former patients who adore him and read hundreds of messages on message boards about him. The overwhelming majority like him, and the ones that don't focus more on his strong  personality than his surgical skills.
I like Derek as a person, but my most important concern is that he be a  great surgeon. I need him to be on top of his game on December 1, but he really doesn't need me to write about him.  He doesn't chase publicity.   He has patients lined up all day and night. He does not spend any personal money on advertising and doesn't need to. After thousands of procedures, he pushes forward to continuously improve his craft with an intense enthusiasm.
He has been terrific on helping me keep costs down.   He is also extremely affordable and highly aware that I am paying for every dime of the medical procedure  without the help of my insurance company.  The hospital has been helpful on the cost front as well.   Picking up my own tab has made me an extremely cost conscious medical consumer and I am thrilled that my cost are dramatically less than others I am seeing on online message boards like www.bariatricpal.com.   In fact, they are in the range of people who are going to other countries like Mexico to get the surgery done more cheaply.
The main thing you get from Derek is his zest for living. Derek Weiss loves being Derek Weiss, and it shows in his infectious zeal for his work. He is a great surgeon and I have done incredible and extensive research to make that statement. Even if I had not done the spadework, I would have guessed on our first meeting that Derek is a master of his craft.
Weiss talks about bariatric surgery the way that some people talk about sex, money or their grandchildren.  It is his passion.  He bubbles with enthusiasm and recognizes that his profession gives people a second chance at life.
Weiss was born into the surgical business. His father was a surgeon at the military base at Fort Knox and his mother was an operating room nurse. He grew up in Louisville, was Magna Cum Laude in Biochemistry at Dartmouth, was in the top 10 percent of his class at the University of Louisville Medical School and did his surgical training (residency) at Emory University where he worked under Dr. John Hunter, an internationally known leader in laparoscopy.
Derek brought his laparoscopy skills back to Louisville and spent eight years as a successful general surgeon when Dr. Tom Lavin, one of the nation's most successful bariatric surgeons, asked Derek to move just outside New Orleans to join his booming weight loss practice.
Weiss has incredible respect and admiration for Dr. Lavin, who he has praised lavishly in every conversation that I have had with Derek. My wife is President of the Ursuline Academy,   the oldest all-girls school in the United States, based in New Orleans, and I suspect the Kentucky to New Orleans connection plays  into our multiple conversations about Dr. Lavin.
Weiss would have been happy spending his career in New Orleans, but a big opportunity came up for him to come home to Kentucky and partner with another surgeon in the bariatric field. They were together for several years and dominated bariatric surgery in Kentucky. His former partner now practices in Louisville, while Derek focuses on Lexington and Central Kentucky.
Derek fits all my criteria for an expert. He is well-educated, passionate about his craft, continuously learning, connected to other top experts and sees his work as  his  calling, not an occupation.
I want a surgeon who can't wait to get up and get into the operating room. Since I am scheduled to be his first patient on Monday, I definitely want him to be enthusiastic about mine. He will be, but he also maintains that enthusiasm for everyone else he operates on.   I recognize that I will probably get VIP treatment but he assures me that every patient gets that same level of care.  I've talked to enough of his former patients to recognize that is true.
I went from a horrible fear and dread of the gastric sleeve surgery to anticipation. Not about the actual surgery, but the idea that I will recover quickly and be on a life journey that will allow me to give back and make a difference.
Like Dr. Derek Weiss is doing.

Bring Your Values to Life and Get the Culture You Wantreddit
In my work I help companies and teams get the culture that they want in their workplace. Sadly, sometimes there is a big gap between the culture that they have and the one they want. I work with teams to assist in assessing this gap and then using values definition and measurement to close this gap so they have the culture they want.
There are many definitions of culture in the workplace, mine is simply "the way things are done here", that is the collection of behaviors of the team. To explain this I often say to the team, "imagine if I were to set up CCTV in the workplace, what would I observe in the behaviors of the team, what would I hear people say to each other?" This is the culture, the way things are done. If I could I would go deeper and monitor what was going on in people's minds: what are they saying to themselves, what are they thinking, what are they feeling, etc. This would give even more insight.
I should define what I mean by values as well. To me values are the things that sit somewhere in our minds that help to filter the world for us and help us choose the most appropriate behavior. Values help us choose right from wrong, they help us make decisions.  We know when our values have been violated as it usually causes a trigger of intense emotion. Values alignment is important to any team or company.
When I explain the concept of values to people I usually start by asking them about their own values, what is important to them. Next I ask if they are in a relationship with someone and ask about the values of the other person and how different or similar they are. Interestingly most people tell me that they are looking for about a 70% match with the other person which is also the answer I hear from people when I ask about what is the match you are looking for in a team or company. This alignment of values will lead to a common culture within the company and if you define your values well and you hire people that have alignment with those values and then you ensure everyone in the company understands them you will have a much better chance of achieving the culture you want. They assist the people in the team to understand how they should behave in certain situations and in doing so drive the culture.
So I could start off with the culture that I want and work back to see what appropriate values I need or the other way and identify the values I want and see how this would manifest into the culture. Either way, values are important and also how you explain the values to people so they make sense and people can understand how they can best live them.
When I was working with the team at wagamama in 2006 we came up with a way to allow the values to come to life and I have always used this everywhere I have worked since.  The idea I had was to use an icon or a talisman for the values. This icon can be fictional/non-fictional, alive or dead but it is someone that you believe epitomizes the value that you are wanting to bring to life.
As an example I am currently working with ROCeteer and there are four high level values that the team have agreed to have as core values. The values are Bold, Inspire, Love and Truth (BILT by ROCeteer). What we have done is selected an icon/talisman for each, I wanted to share each, why we picked them, how we use them and inspire you to do the same if you like this approach.
BOLD: We want to be bold, courageous, follow our own path. We selected Captain Kirk to be our icon for this value because he was very bold and courageous and acted with passion.
INSPIRE: We want to inspire people and also be open to be inspired by others. We selected Oprah Winfrey to be our icon for this value because she is an inspiration to so many people and her life story is incredibly inspirational.
LOVE: We want to be playful and love our customers, team, our family and the community we serve. We selected Elmo to be our icon for this value because Elmo is fun and playful and wants the world to love more.
TRUTH: We want to search for truth and speak the truth. We selected Neo (The Matrix) to be our icon for this value because he was a force of truth in helping people see reality instead of the Matrix
Now that we have the icons for each of our values there is a lot we can do with this, here are some examples:
We can select quotes from each icon to use as symbols and ideals of what the value stands for, e.g., Captain Kirk's "boldly go where no man has gone before."
We can create a collection of stories of situations a team member may find themselves in and explore how the icon would behave in that situation, e.g., if you are living in your head too much and not exploring the real world what would Neo say or even do? Maybe the Matrix has you?
We can create a 'brand conscience' and ask the team to imagine our icons were sitting on their shoulder helping them.  Similar to Obi-Wan Kenobi helping Luke Skywalker at key times.
I have found that creating value icons is a great way of bringing values to life and helping the team understand the essence of their values and live them consistently. Most importantly, it provides the team a better chance of achieving the culture that they want.

The Best Time to Buy Holiday Airfare is...The best time to buy holiday airfare is...
Rob Lovitt TODAY contributor
Email
Justin Sullivan / Getty Images North America
Travelers wait in line to check in for their flights at San Francisco International Airport November two days before Thanksgiving.
When it comes to holiday travel, there are certain things you can always count on. Security waits will be interminable, planes will be packed and millions of procrastinating people will ponder the age-old question of when is the best time to buy airfare.
If you have to ask, you’re probably already too late.
“People always feel like the holidays are a long way away but the longer you wait, the more you’re likely to spend,” said Patrick Surry, chief data scientist for Hopper.com, an airfare-pricing website. 
Furthermore, he notes, the typical consumer searches for flights for up to two weeks, incurring another five percent in “procrastination costs” between the time they start looking and the time they decide to buy.
Take Thanksgiving travel. Analyzing 2013 pricing data, the number crunchers at Orbitz determined that the best day to buy this year was Oct. 10, with average fares available through Oct. 21. However, when their counterparts at Kayak ran their numbers, they determined that average fares were actually lower in mid-November than mid-October. Surry’s research showed prices were relatively flat throughout the period before spiking 10 days before the holiday.
The data for Christmas isn’t much clearer. Orbitz says you’d have gotten the best deal if you’d bought in early October while Hopper says you could’ve waited until around Halloween. For those who haven’t pulled the trigger yet, both Kayak and Travelocity suggest a second window for deals may open in early December.
While disappointing for deal-hunters, the discrepancies shouldn’t be surprising. The size and incredible complexity of the system — non-stops vs. connecting flights, price vs. convenience bookings and a near-infinite array of city pairs — makes apples-to-oranges comparisons across the system almost impossible. 
Bottom line: Finding a deal has more to do with what’s happening with bookings for your particular flight and route than the system overall.
Video: A firm that processes tickets for travel agents, dealing with about half of all airline tickets, found that Sundays had the lowest average airfares of the week.
“The thing we’ve discovered looking at all these prices is that there is no easy answer,” said Surry. “You really have to research each particular trip.”
That reality also applies to the age-old debate about what day of the week offers the best deals. For years, conventional wisdom has had it that Tuesday was your best bet as airline executives played Monday-morning quarterback over slow weekend sales and offered up quick sales to fill seats.
In September, however, Airlines Reporting Corp., which handles ticket sales for travel agencies and other third-party sellers, threw that logic for a loop when it released a report showing that the cheapest fares are not found on Tuesday, but over the weekend.
The report , which looked at nearly 130 million ticket sales between January 2013 and July 2014 found that the lowest fares were actually found on Sunday, when the average price was $432, 13 percent lower than Tuesday’s $497. Saturday came in second at $439.
Alas, this may be yet another case of apples and oranges as the Tuesday figure no doubt includes plenty of business travelers booking last-minute, high-priced tickets while weekend bookings are dominated by leisure travelers looking for the lowest possible fare. Thus, average fares purchased on weekends are bound to be lower.
Or not. According to an as-yet-unpublished Hopper analysis, the average cheapest time to buy a ticket is between midnight Tuesday and 1 a.m. Wednesday. Looking at 20 million searches over the last four months, the company determined that prices during that period were 2.5 percent below average. Unfortunately, the data also revealed that that only applied to 1.6 percent of the markets studied.
Needless to say, that scenario is even less likely to play out during the holidays, when filling empty seats isn’t an issue.
On the other hand, it’s never too early to start thinking about Thanksgiving... 2015.

US-led coalition airstrikes pound Islamic State stronghold in SyriaBy: Associated Press | Beirut |
Posted: November 30, 2014 4:58 pm
Syrian activists say the US-led coalition has carried out as many as 30 airstrikes against Islamic State militants in and around the group’s de facto capital in northeastern Syria.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Sunday that the strikes took place overnight and targeted IS positions in the city of Raqqa as well as the Division 17 air base, which the militants seized earlier this year from government forces.
The monitoring group, which relies on a network of activists inside Syria, reported at least 30 coalition strikes in all. The Local Coordination Committees, an activist collective, also confirmed the airstrikes. Neither group had casualty figures.

Musical ability  its all in the genesMusical ability — it’s all in the genes
ANU ACHARYA
Tweet
All in the family Amjad Ali Khan and his sons carry the musical genes of the sarod maestro's father, Hafeez Ali. - S MAHINSHA
Either you have it in you, or you don’t. And, the kind of music that you take to is genetically determined as well
November 30, 2014:  
Several years ago, I watched a documentary musical, Latcho Drom, about the migration of the Romany people from India to Egypt, Turkey, Romania Hungary, Slovakia, France and Spain. The beautiful transition of music as the central theme of their cultural migration is sketched in my mind. Recent studies in genetics also point to genetic similarity that shows the same migration pattern.
The other interesting correlation is between musical ability and genetics. There are some people who seem to have an inbuilt musical ability. Like wealth, music has been carefully preserved and proliferates in certain families; in the gharanas of the Hindustani music tradition, such as Patiala, Agra, Gwalior and Jaipur, for instance. Interestingly, in the Carnatic tradition, many of the musicians are brahmins. This shows that genes have a possible impact at two levels: on musical ability and the kind of music that one takes to.
Your kind of music
In the 1970s, Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza, a geneticist at Stanford University in California, argued that combining genetics with fields such as linguistics and demography could help trace human ancestry. Floyd Reed, a population geneticist at the University of Maryland in College Park, worked on this further. He first crunched the existing catalogues to convert the cantometric database into a two-dimensional scatter plot, with each dot representing a culture. The closeness of the dots showed their similarity in music. He found that the music of African bushmen cultures, such as the Juhoansi, fell close to that of pygmy tribes such as the Aka. And in this plot he found that groups such as the Hutu were farther away and they sing in unison.
When Floyd compared the graph with a database of genotypes from more than 3,000 people in Africa, he found a correlation between genes and songs. In other words, cultures that had grouped together musically tended to share genetic markers.
Making links
The link was stronger than the correlation between songs and geography: cultures next door to each other weren’t as likely to sing the same tunes as were cultures with similar genotypes. Music reveals deeper biological connections between people than characteristics such as language, that change when one culture meets another.
Moving to inherent musical abilities, Miriam Mosing of the Karolinska Institute, Sweden, suggests that practising music without the right genes to back up that practice is indeed useless. To prove this she took a fairly large sample size of 1,211 pairs of identical twins (who share all their genes) and 1,358 pairs of fraternal twins (who share half) born between 1959 and 1985 and concluded that genes have a profound effect on their musical ability.
So which genes have been found to affect musical ability? It seems like the best association was found at chromosome 3 close to the GATA2 gene that regulates the development of cochlear hair cells and the inferior colliculus (IC) in the auditory pathway. The best linkage results were obtained on chromosome 4 that contains several genes that affect inner ear development and are expressed in amydala or hippocampus. The highest probability of linkage was obtained for pitch perception accuracy next to the protocadherin 7 gene, PCDH7 known to be expressed in cochlear and amygdaloid complexes.
Music is ingrained and while it may be true that some of us have the talent, others can enjoy listening to it. Given my love for music, it is possible that I could have done well had I bothered to practice. Perhaps, it is not too late.

Expect rate cut tomorrow  will add to sentiment: Ceat02:30 pm
Will he or won't he is the question in the minds of most people today. Will Reserve Bank governor Raghuram Rajan give in to popular demand and lower policy rates on Tuesday?
While majority of the bankers and economists polled by CNBC-TV18 say Rajan will yet again keep policy rates unchanged on December 2, a 5 percent expect a 25 bps rate cut this time.
Subba Rao Amarthaluru, CFO of  Ceat believes if a rate cut doesn’t happen tomorrow everyone will lose hope. "An interest rate cut will add to sentiment, which will give hope, and most people will feel positive about making investments," he says. He expects Rajan to lower rates at the monetary policy tomorrow.
Below is the verbatim transcript of Subba Rao Amarthaluru's interview with Menaka Doshi and Senthil Chengalvarayan on CNBC-TV18.
Menaka: Are you going to be disappointed if there is no interest rate cut tomorrow or are you fully expecting that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is going to take maybe a couple of more quarters before they feel we are ready for one?
A: There is universal prayer for the cut of interest rate. If it doesn’t happen every one of us will lose hope. What more better conditions you want for the cut in interest rates? Can we control food inflation by increasing interest rates?
On one hand you say that crude prices are not related to inflation; it is the food which is related to inflation. By keeping interest rates high can you cut down food inflation?
Food inflation has come down in the last few months but interest rates have been high for years together now.
Senthil: One of the arguments that industry is making is that it will make the investor cycle pick up. But is there really such a correlation because most of the problems are structural and not for the want of a cheap money?
A: Agreed, it adds to sentiments like Modi government has added to the sentiment and this will add to the sentiment. That sentiment will get hope that hope will make the things work. It is all about sentiment, you know how mind and heart works together.
Menaka: Are you saying that if rates are cut tomorrow then everybody across industry will suddenly feel more positive about investing in new projects?
A: Yes, at least you start going back to the drawing board and it is okay one more rate cut will come next year.
Menaka: Are you saying that interest rates are the only reason why we haven’t seen investments, I am curious to know why we are giving interest rates that big weightage for the reasons for why things haven’t worked in the last few years?
A: One percent in the case of infra companies, leave aside the manufacturing section companies which do not have that kind of huge debt, one percent reduction in the case of infra companies which have Rs 40,000-50,000 crore debt, look at the kind of impact that they will have. The whole economy will feel positive about this kind of transformation in some segment of the economy.
Senthil: It will do something for sentiment but how quickly will it flow down? If you look at, our investment through gross domestic product (GDP) is now at about 31 percent which is pretty good. The problem is not rates it is possibly our productivity, we still manage only a 5-5.5 percent growth. So, there is something seriously wrong with productivity so will productivity be improved by that rate cut?
A: No, there is no single factor, in bad times you need your right recipe. This is one of the ingredients of the recipe.
Senthil: You are hoping for a rate cut, most of industry is hoping for a rate cut, equity market is hoping for a rate cut but do you see it coming tomorrow?
A: Honestly yes, you wish something that you want so let the sub conscious mind work that out.
Menaka: You are asking for the RBI to choose between trying to make things a little easier for the common man in terms of being able to structurally defeat the inflationary trend that we have seen as oppose to trying to make things a little easier for business. It is a Hobson’s choice at the end of the day? Are you saying that ease of business for people like you is more important than vegetable prices for people like me?
A: You contribute to the overall good sentiment. It is a minor contribution that RBI is going to make. 50 basis point cut is not going to shake up anything on the adverse side but it will add to good sentiment greatly.
Senthil: There is one school of thoughts that thinks that if you cut rates tomorrow your forgoing a much larger cut in the next one year or so?
A: That hope that something else is going to happen in the next six months, that is more important.

LPG cyclinder price cut by Rs 113 as crude prices fallComments
Price of non-subsidised cooking gas (LPG) was on Monday cut by a steep Rs. 113 per cylinder and that of jet fuel (ATF) by 4.1% as international oil rates slumped to multi-year lows.
A 14.2-kg cylinder of non-subsidised LPG will now cost Rs. 752, down from Rs. 865 previously, in Delhi, oil companies announced on Monday.
This is the fifth straight reduction in rates of non-subsidised or market priced LPG, which the customers buy after exhausting their quota of 12 cylinders at subsidised rates, since August.
In five monthly reduction, non-domestic LPG rates have been slashed by Rs. 170.5 per cylinder, bringing the price at three-year lows.
On similar lines, the price of aviation turbine fuel (ATF), or jet fuel, at Delhi was cut by Rs. 2,594.93 per kilolitre, or 4.1%, to Rs. 59,943 per kilolitre (kl).
This is the fifth straight monthly reduction in rates. This reduction follows a steep 7.3% or Rs. 4,987.7 per kl, cut in prices on November 1.
Since August, ATF prices have been cut by 14.5% or Rs. 10,218.76 per kl and rates have dipped below Rs. 60,000 per kl level for the first time in three years.
Brent, the benchmark grade for more than half of the world's oil, have dropped to $68.34 a barrel, the lowest level since October 2009.
Prices declined 18% last month and are 38% lower in 2014. In Mumbai, jet fuel will cost Rs. 61,695 per kl from Monday as against Rs. 64,414.98 per kl previously. The rates vary because of differences in local sales tax or VAT.

Rouble heading for biggest one-day fall since 1998 as oil drops below $70Russian central bank saves rouble from biggest one-day fall since 1998
Reuters Dec 1, 2014, 06.24PM IST
(The rouble looked set for…)
MOSCOW: The rouble was looking all set for its steepest one-day fall against the US dollar since the Russian financial crisis of 1998 on Monday, but then the Russian central bank started to intervene on the foreign exchange market to curb losses, three traders said on Monday.
"It may have been the central bank," a trader at a Western bank told Reuters. The central bank declined to comment.
The rouble looked set for its steepest one-day fall since the Russian financial crisis of 1998 on Monday, plunging more than 6 percent against the dollar before recovering to losses of around 4 percent.
Earlier in the day, the dollar-based RTS stock index was down 3.1 percent to 944 points, having touched a five-year low of 930. In contrast the rouble-based MICEX, which benefits from a weaker rouble, was up 2.1 percent to 1,571 points, a 2014 high.
Oil benchmark Brent futures were hovering just above a five-year low, at $69.6 per barrel, weighed down by weak manufacturing data from China and last week's decision by OPEC not to cut oil production to support prices.
OPEC's shock decision means markets are increasingly pricing in the likelihood of cheap oil for an extended period, causing a fundamental reassessment of Russian asset prices, analysts said.
Oil and gas account for about two thirds of Russia's exports and half of federal budget revenues, making its economy and asset prices heavily dependent on global energy prices.
The rouble crashed through the psychologically significant, and until recently unthinkable, level of 50 against the dollar on Friday, bringing its losses since mid-year to 35 percent.
"Support for the rouble at present can only come from stabilisation of the oil price. Other factors now look secondary and of little significance," Globex Bank senior trader Igor Zelentsov said in a note.

Steve Jobs still a presence in courtrooms po...Steve Jobs a presence in courtrooms across US, even three years after his death

(Three years after his death,…)
By Brian X. Chen
SAN FRANCISCO - Three years after his death, Steve Jobs is very much a presence in courtrooms across the country. And that's not necessarily good news for Apple.
Next month, the company is set to go to trial in the third major antitrust lawsuit it has faced since Jobs died. His emails will play an important role in the case, as they did in the last two. But lawyers will probably have to work hard to give his statements a positive spin. The potential damages - around $350 million - are a pittance for a company that in its last quarter had an $8.5 billion profit.
Executives are often told by their lawyers to be careful what they put in writing for fear it will end up as evidence in a courtroom. Perhaps Jobs did not get the memo. His emails in past lawsuits - a mix of blunt litigation threats against his opponents and cheery financial promises for potential business partners - have made him an exceptional witness against his own company, even beyond the grave.
The emails in all these cases present the good and bad of Steve Jobs - charmer and bully, someone who may not always have played by the rules. He was a "genius in terms of his vision for the future," said Michael A. Carrier, a professor at Rutgers School of Law. "But it went along with a really healthy ego and perhaps the lack of an antitrust filter - thinking about how these words would appear years later tossed up on the screen in front of a jury."
The latest case to bring Jobs' spirit into a courtroom is set to begin Tuesday in Oakland, California. It is a class action involving older iPods, which played only songs sold in the iTunes Store, or those downloaded from CDs, not music from competing stores. The plaintiffs are consumers who say Apple violated antitrust law because to keep their music, people had to stay with the iPod, and buy higher-priced ones rather than cheaper, alternative music players. Apple has since discontinued this system.
Jobs' emails and videotaped deposition taken before his death, plaintiffs' lawyers say, will portray him as planning to break a competitor's product to protect Apple's grip on digital music.
"We will present evidence that Apple took action to block its competitors and in the process harmed competition and harmed consumers," said Bonny Sweeney, the lead plaintiffs' lawyer.
Apple declined to comment. A few of the emails have already been made public. In one, sent in 2003 to other Apple executives, Jobs expressed concern about Musicmatch, a software company, opening its own music store.
"We need to make sure that when Music Match launches their download music store they cannot use iPod," he wrote. "Is this going to be an issue?" More emails are expected to become public during the trial.
In this case, the overwhelming impression of Jobs is likely to be of an aggressive businessman eager to ensure and protect the iPod's success. In other cases tried since his death, he appears in a far less flattering light - as a ruthless executive willing to strong-arm smaller companies.
In 2010, Apple and five other Silicon Valley companies were accused in a class action of conspiring to keep wages down by agreeing not to recruit one another's workers. The case is set to go to trial in January, after the judge rejected a settlement agreement. Jobs will be a star witness - or his words will. Plaintiffs' lawyers have portrayed Jobs as a ringleader of the conspiracy, pointing to his emails like one sent in 2006 to Eric Schmidt, a Google executive.
 
"I am told that Googles new cellphone software group is relentlessly recruiting in our iPod group," Jobs wrote, according to the court documents. "If this is indeed true, can you put a stop to it?"
Jobs also tried to make a no-poaching agreement with Palm. When a Palm executive rejected that idea in an email, Jobs replied, "My advice is to take a look at our patent portfolio before you make a final decision here" - a threat to embroil Palm in patent litigation.
In 2012, the Justice Department accused Apple and five other publishers of colluding to raise e-book prices. In the trial, government lawyers showed an excerpt from Jobs' authorized biography in which he said he wanted publishers, not retailers, to set the price of titles.
"Yes, the customer pays a little more, but that's what you want anyway," Jobs told the publishers, the biography said.
Throughout the trial, government lawyers frequently brought up an email written by Jobs to a media executive, in which he suggested that by teaming up with Apple, publishers could sell titles for higher than Amazon's $9.99 pricing for e-books.
"Throw in with Apple and see if we can all make a go of this to create a real mainstream e-books market at $12.99 and $14.99," he wrote.

FB won t let politicians access your friends...Now, Facebook won't let politicians automatically access your friends list

(Obama's 2012 campaign used…)
By Derek Willis
When you log in to a politician's Facebook app, the campaign enjoys relatively easy access to your friends on the social network. But starting next year, that automatic access will go away.
That may provide users with some relief from unwanted messages. It will certainly help Facebook respond to complaints that it shares too much of its users' information without their consent. But it also could lead to more campaigns advertising on the platform, which is good for the company's bottom line.
President Barack Obama's 2012 campaign used Facebook to create a list of 1 million people; users who signed into its website via Facebook used the campaign's custom app to do so. They were then asked to authorize the campaign to access information about all of their Facebook friends. When granted, the campaign could compare those users with existing voter files in order to help better define the voters it needed to reach. Now many political campaigns have their own Facebook apps, not just pages.
The change, which was detailed on Facebook's site for Web developers in April, means that beginning in May users of a campaign's app will have to explicitly authorize access to their friends. But even when they do, the campaign will see only those friends who have also signed into the campaign's app. Additionally, Facebook users will be able to log in to apps anonymously (they would still be logged into Facebook, but the app would not have access to any specific user information). Those options will limit the scope of people to whom campaigns will have automatic access, although it still gives political operatives a way to gain access to the broader list of Facebook friends. It will just take more work and money.
Jon Ward of Yahoo News described the change as "closing the door on one of the most sophisticated social targeting efforts ever undertaken." That's true, in the sense that campaigns won't be able to do exactly what the Obama campaign did when its supporters signed up for its Facebook app.
But the ability to find friends of supporters on Facebook isn't completely gone. It will just require more effort both from campaigns and from their Facebook fans. One way to do this is to ask Facebook supporters to send messages directly to their friends. That's a much less efficient tactic, and one not completely controlled by the campaign, but friend-to-friend contacts can be a valuable method of persuading voters. Another is to ask campaign supporters to define their relationships - online and off - with other supporters in the same geographic area, or by interest.
While campaigns want to learn about supporters' Facebook friends, having details about the nature of that relationship - is this a family member, a friend from college, a co-worker? - could prove more useful for persuading and turning out voters. Knowing if a person brought a friend into the campaign is better than simply knowing that some relationship exists between the two. But building that knowledge will require more time and effort from campaigns and users.
 
This change doesn't affect Facebook's development of more sophisticated tools for advertisers, including one that allows campaigns to match voter lists to existing Facebook users with an email address or telephone number. In fact, it is a gentle nudging of campaigns toward spending more money on advertising to Facebook users, rather than simply getting access to them for free.

Why is Europe s economy in such dire straitsWhy is Europe's economy in such dire straits?

(Unemployment in the euro…)
By Paul Krugman
The US economy finally seems to be climbing out of the deep hole it entered during the global financial crisis. Unfortunately, Europe, the other epicenter of crisis, can't say the same. Unemployment in the euro area is stalled at almost twice the US level, while inflation is far below both the official target and outright deflation has become a looming risk.
Investors have taken notice: European interest rates have plunged, with German long-term bonds yielding just 0.7 per cent. That's the kind of yield we used to associate with Japanese deflation, and markets are indeed signaling that they expect Europe to experience its own lost decade.
Why is Europe in such dire straits? The conventional wisdom among European policymakers is that we're looking at the price of irresponsibility: some governments have failed to behave with the prudence a shared currency requires, choosing instead to pander to misguided voters and cling to failed economic doctrines. And if you ask me (and a number of other economists who have looked hard at the issue), this analysis is essentially right, except for one thing: They've got the identity of the bad actors wrong.
For the bad behavior at the core of Europe's slow-motion disaster isn't coming from Greece, or Italy, or France. It's coming from Germany.
I'm not denying that the Greek government behaved irresponsibly before the crisis, or that Italy has a big problem with stagnating productivity. But Greece is a small country whose fiscal mess is unique, while Italy's long-run problems aren't the source of Europe's deflationary downdraft. If you try to identify countries whose policies were way out of line before the crisis, have hurt Europe since the crisis, and refuse to learn from experience, everything points to Germany as the worst actor.
Consider, in particular, the comparison between Germany and France.
France gets a lot of bad press, with much talk in particular about its supposed loss in competitiveness. Such talk greatly exaggerates the reality; you'd never know from most media reports that France runs only a small trade deficit. Still, to the extent that there is an issue here, where does it come from? Has French competitiveness been eroded by excessive growth in costs and prices?
  No, not at all. Since the euro came into existence in 1999, France's GDP deflator (the average price of French-produced goods and services) has risen 1.7 per cent per year, while its unit labor costs have risen 1.9 per cent annually. Both numbers are right in line with the European Central Bank's target of slightly under 2 per cent inflation, and similar to what has happened in the United States. Germany, on the other hand, is way out of line, with price and labor-cost growth of 1 and 0.5 per cent, respectively.
And it's not just France whose costs are just about where they ought to be. Spain saw rising costs and prices during the housing bubble, but at this point all the excess has been eliminated through years of crushing unemployment and wage restraint. Italian cost growth has arguably been a bit too high, but it's not nearly as far out of line as Germany is on the low side.
In other words, to the extent that there's anything like a competitiveness problem in Europe, it's overwhelmingly caused by Germany's beggar-thy-neighbor policies, which are in effect exporting deflation to its neighbors.
But what about debt? Isn't non-German Europe paying the price for past fiscal irresponsibility? Actually, that's a story about Greece and nobody else. And it's especially wrong in the case of France, which isn't facing a fiscal crisis at all; France can currently borrow long-term at a record low interest rate of less than 1 per cent, only slightly above the German rate.
Yet European policymakers seem determined to blame the wrong countries and the wrong policies for their plight. True, the European Commission has floated a plan to stimulate the economy with public investment - but the public outlay is so tiny compared with the problem that the plan is almost a joke. And meanwhile, the commission is warning France, which has the lowest borrowing costs in its history, that it may face fines for not cutting its budget deficit enough.
What about resolving the problem of too little inflation in Germany? Very aggressive monetary policy might do the trick (although I wouldn't count on it), but German monetary officials are warning against such policies because they might let debtors off the hook.
What we're seeing, then, is the immensely destructive power of bad ideas. It's not entirely Germany's fault - Germany is a big player in Europe, but it's only able to impose deflationary policies because so much of the European elite has bought into the same false narrative. And you have to wonder what will cause reality to break in.

Rupee closes day below 62 against US $ | Crude below $68; OMCs now a blind buyMoody's
(Rupee ended largely steady…)
MUMBAI: Rupee ended largely steady on Monday after touching a near 9-1/2 month low, as dollar selling by exporters helped offset the weakness seen due to lower Asian currencies and global growth concerns.
Sentiment also remained cautious ahead of the RBI's monetary policy review on Tuesday.
All emerging Asian currencies hit new lows on a day when Moody's downgraded Japan's sovereign credit rating stating "heightened uncertainty over the achievability of fiscal deficit reduction goals."
Meanwhile, the dollar continued to be boosted by oil's longest losing streak since the 2008 financial crisis. On Monday, oil prices extended from last week their steep sell-off after OPEC decided not to cut production, keeping markets well supplied.
"Asian units are reacting to the commodity deflation feeding into the strong dollar trend, apart from the fact that global growth is going down the tube," said Anindya Banerjee, a currency analyst at Kotak Securities in Mumbai.
Traders are now bracing up for the Reserve Bank of India's policy review amid rising expectation of a cut in policy rates despite most analysts in a Reuters poll expecting the central bank to maintain status quo.
The partially convertible rupee closed at 62.02/03 per dollar versus 62.0250/0350 on Friday. It hit a low of 62.25 intraday, its weakest since Feb. 20.
Traders said dollar sales by exporters and custodian banks helped the rupee recover from session lows.
In the offshore non-deliverable forwards market, the one-month contract was at 62.36, while the three-month was at 62.87.

Trinamool targets Amit Shah  alleges he is named in Sahara  red diaryComments
Trinamool Congress on Monday launched an offensive on the Bharatiya Janata Party in Parliament and held a rally in Kolkata to counter the saffron party president Amit Shah's criticism of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Sunday.
Facing heat over the Saradha scam, Trinamool targeted the BJP inside as well as outside Parliament by alleging that a diary of jailed Sahara group chief Subrata Roy contained the name of a senior leader of the saffron party, leading to clashes and a walkout.
Placard-wielding Trinamool MPs held a demonstration outside Parliament demanding a probe into alleged links between Shah and the Sahara money laundering case.
Trinamool sought to corner the ruling party in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha by displaying symbolic red diaries.
The Trinamool members alleged the diary was recovered from Sahara chief Subrata Roy by the Central Bureau of Investigation during searches at Sahara's office and claimed it contained the name of a BJP leader.
Attack in Parliament
In Lok Sabha, Trinamool MPs rushed to the Well shouting slogans, carrying red-coloured diaries which had "Sahara" written on it. They demanded that PM Modi should explain what action the CBI has taken after the name allegedly figured in the diary. They later staged a walkout.
Bandyopadhyay had given a notice for suspension of Question Hour to discuss the issue which was rejected by Speaker Sumitra Mahajan.
"They (Trinamool MPs) have decided not to follow the rules," she said.
Parliamentary affairs minister M Venkaiah Naidu said according to rules no member can name anyone who is not a member of the House. They also cannot display placards, he said.
To this, the Speaker said the name of the BJP leader would not go on record.
After protesting for a few minutes, the Trinamool MPs staged a walkout.
Minister of state for home affairs Kiren Rijiju, however, denied the presence of the "red diary".
"These are political allegations. There is no truth in it. No such diary was recovered," Rijiju told reporters in Delhi.
Later, BJP member Kirit Somaiya hit back, alleging that the Trinamool government in West Bengal was creating "hurdles" in the CBI investigation into the Saradha chit fund scam, in which names of "one dozen" Trinamool leaders have cropped up.
This led to protests by Trinamool members but Somaiya went on saying that 3.5 lakh small investors had been cheated in the chit fund scheme.
"The state government is not cooperating with the CBI probe," he alleged.
Amid noisy scenes, the Speaker adjourned the House for lunch, ahead of schedule.
In Rajya Sabha, Trinamool's Derek O'Brien sought to raise the issue during Zero Hour and Question Hour but was disallowed.
He had earlier given a notice for suspension of Question Hour but was not allowed.
As O'Brien rose to raise the issue during Question Hour, BJP members shouted him down by raising the issue of Saradha chit fund scam.
The members flashed symbolic red diaries with Sahara written on them, and tried to storm the well of the upper house as well to press their demand.
Trinamool members later staged a walkout as they were disallowed from raising the issue.
Counter-rally in Kolkata
Mamata Banerjee's nephew and Diamond Harbour Lok Sabha MP, Abhisekh Banerjee, said the West Bengal chief minister does not want to respond to Shah as she believes "he is not of her stature".
Mamata cancelled an appearance at the rally held by Abhishek to counter Shah's allegations levelled against her by Shah.
Speaking almost from the same spot where Shah delivered his Sunday speech, Abhisekh attacked the BJP and PM Modi saying he has done nothing for West Bengal after coming to power.
Abhisekh mocked Modi by comparing him with his aunt saying while he flies in private jets, goes abroad and changes wardrobe frequently, Mamata stays in a small house, wears handloom sarees and chappals.
Without naming Shah, he said those who come to Bengal like migratory birds, address a rally and return to Delhi will not win elections in the state.
Abhisekh also alleged Union minister of law and justice Sadanand Gowda's assets jumped from Rs. 9 crore to Rs. 20 crore in three months, and BJP must explain it.
Shah on Sunday had sounded the poll bugle to oust Trinamool from the state in the 2015 Kolkata Municipal Corporation and 2016 assembly elections and called for a Trinamool-free Bengal.
The BJP's rise in Bengal has sparked speculations about new equations in the state's political arena where the saffron brigade was only a fringe player until recently.
However, banking on Modi's poll promises on development, the party bagged an impressive 16.8% vote share in the April-May Lok Sabha elections. Even though the BJP won just two of the 42 seats, it made an impact.
Frequent clashes between BJP and Trinamool supporters have been reported in West Bengal since the polls.
The BJP chief's address came at a time when the ruling Trinamool is reeling under graft allegations in the multi-crore Saradha chit fund scam and the Burdwan blasts on October 2 that killed two alleged militants from Bangladesh.
Addressing the rally that saw a crowd of two lakh people, Shah had attacked Banerjee over the Saradha case, terrorist activities as well as lack of development in the state.
The TMC on Sunday had refused to attach much importance to Shah's rally and described it as a 'grand flop show'.
The city police, West Bengal fire department and the Kolkata Municipal Corporation had denied permission for the event at the Victoria House, where the ruling Trinamool usually organises its annual martyrs' day rally.
An intervention by the Calcutta high court saw the BJP getting the nod only at the eleventh hour.

Losses on sale of subsidised LPG and kerosene have dropped by 21 percent to Rs 148 crore per day as international oil rates hit a five-year low.
State-owned fuel retailers are losing Rs 25.69 on sale of every litre of kerosene through the Public Distribution System (PDS) and Rs 279.91 per 14.2-kg domestic cooking gas, an official statement said today.
These are lower than Rs 27.60 a litre loss oil firms were incurring on sale through PDS in November, and Rs 393.50 per LPG cylinder.
"Oil marketing companies (OMCs), effective December 1, 2014, are now incurring combined daily under-recovery of about Rs 148 crore on the sale of PDS kerosene and domestic LPG. This is lower than Rs 188 crore daily under-recoveries during previous month," it said.

After diesel price was deregulated on October 18, only two products remain subsidised.
The statement said the under-recovery or the revenue loss incurred on selling fuel below cost, in the first half of current fiscal was Rs 51,110 crore. "The figure was Rs 139,869 crore for full year in the 2013-14."
While the government had freed pricing of petrol from its control in June 2010, diesel was deregulated on October 18. Since then, diesel rates have been cut thrice - first by Rs 3.37 a litre on October 19, then by Rs 2.25 per litre from November 1 and by 84 paisa from today.

Another meeting is also likely to take place late Monday evening and it will be attended by Shiv Sena supremo Uddhav Thackeray and senior leaders Subhash and Anil Desai.
Monday's meeting was a part of a series of interactions between the two parties raising speculations of ties being on the mend. The BJP has been trying hard to bring Sena on board for a post-poll alliance before the winter session, which commences on December 8.
#maharashtra #shiv sena #bjp #uddhav thackeray
The Shiv Sena had claimed the post of the Leader of the Opposition's post in the Maharashtra Assembly after the BJP had refused to give key Cabinet posts to the party. Sena has been adamant on taking deputy chief minister's post and some key portfolios for its leaders.
Fadnavis had earlier also expressed his desire to have Sena as part of the government. "BJP wants that Sena join the government. We fully favour this," he had said.
There were reports of a deal being reached between BJP president Amit Shah and Uddhav with Sena likely to get 10 berths in the Fadnavis government, including four of Cabinet rank. However, there is no confirmation of the same.

AP will have Japan s imprint on developments | Maha CM puts port projects on fast trackChandrababu Naidu wants Andhra Pradesh to shine with help from 'land of rising sun'

Andhra Pradesh
(Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe…)
HYDERABAD: Andhra Pradesh will have Japan's imprint on development in various spheres, particularly in building the state's new capital, if plans drawn out by the TDP-led Government fructify.
Not only Japan's top companies and organisations but also the its government has agreed to "work with us" and aid in development of the "sunrise state", Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu said today and expressed satisfaction over his five-day successful trip to Asian economic powerhouse last week.
Naidu is promoting Andhra Pradesh as a "sunrise state" given its location in the east-coast zone.
Briefing mediapersons about the outcome of his second foreign visit after taking over as the Chief Minister of the truncated State, Naidu said the main purpose of his trip was to make preparation for long-term development plans for AP.
"I am preparing long-term plans for the State and not looking at instant gains. Japan Government has promised support and its participation in our State's development while major Japanese companies and organisations have also agreed to chip in with investments and other assistance," he said.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was "very positive" after knowing the state's development plans, the Chief Minister said, adding, "I have requested Abe to visit Andhra Pradesh when he tours India next year and he has agreed."
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), he said, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the AP Government to promote direct investment by companies from Asia's second largest economy into Andhra Pradesh in urban development, infrastructure, manufacturing, agriculture, food processing and information technology.
METI would also support development of industrial parks in AP, he added. Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has come forward to prepare a project report on the industrial potential in AP and promote investments.
"We are in the third place now in Japanese investment but we want to make it No 1. Already three Japanese companies are investing in the Sri City SEZ in Chittoor district and more are expected to come," the Chief Minister said.
SoftBank, a major business group of Japan, has evinced interest in setting up 10,000 MW of solar power plants in AP.
"SoftBank Chairman and CEO Masayoshi Son is currently doing some research to make the solar power project cost- effective and efficient so that the per unit cost could be brought down to Rs 4 from the current Rs 6.5," he said.

Bangladesh: Security agencies arrest 3 Myanmar nationals linked to Burdwan blast29

Dhaka: Three Myanmar nationals have been arrested in connection with the Burdwan blast, as India and Bangladesh stepped up the hunt for the conspirators along their borders to nab over 100 militants of the outlawed JMB.
The three are members of Rohingya Solidarity Organisation (RSO) and other Myanmar-based outfits, said Krishna Pada Roy, deputy commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) on Monday.
Five detonators, two gel-based bomb materials and 500 kg of explosives were seized from them, police said adding that the arrest came in line with intelligence shared with India.
The arrests came shortly after a Bangladeshi security team returned home after sharing information on the issue with officials in India.
#bangladesh #myanmar #burdwan blast #west bengal
"We do not have information about as to whether they went to India or not," Roy said. "We suspect that the arrestees have close ties with those accused in the Burdwan blast."
"Prima facie, they trespassed into Bangladesh. They are involved with the militant group RSO. They studied in 'madarasa' as a cover up and operate militant activities underneath," he said.
Additional Deputy Commissioner of Detective Branch Saidur Rahman said, "They are Rohingya militants. They have links with RSO, Arakan Rohingya Union (ARU) and Netherlands-based NGO Global Rohingya Center (GRC)."
The three are said to have confessed that Khalid Mohammed, who was earlier arrested in India in connection with the Burdwan blast, is their ideological leader, the Dailystar reported.
Earlier on Monday, the DMP told media that the three militants were linked to the banned militant outfit Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB).
Those arrested were identified as Noor Hossain alias Rafiqul Islam, 26, Yasir Arafat, 22 and Umar Karim, 25. The trio were arrested from Dhaka's Lalbagh area last night.
The arrests came shortly after a Bangladeshi security team returned home after sharing information on the issue with officials in India.
An NIA team from India had earlier visited Dhaka to probe the blast in a house in Burdwan in West Bengal on October 2. Two suspected JMB operatives were killed and another injured in the explosion.
A member of the Bangladeshi team investigating the case told media that law enforcement agencies of the two countries have launched simultaneous drives in their respective territories to capture over 100 JMB operatives in line with a decision taken during the NIA team's Bangladesh visit.
JMB militants who crossed into Bangladesh are on the run as Indian investigators are desperately looking for them after the Burdwan blast.
In October, Bangladesh Police arrested five operatives of JMB including the chief of its women wing and wife of the alleged mastermind of the Burdwan blast, Sajid.

Anxious Cyber Monday for Retailers After Thanksgiving Sales BustAn Anxious Cyber Monday for Retailers After Thanksgiving Sales Bust
 
Morning Money Memo:
The biggest shopping weekend of the year was a bust for some retailers. Early discounting and more online shopping may have put a big dent Black Friday shopping. “Overall shopper traffic from Thanksgiving Day through Sunday dropped 5.2 percent from 2013,” the National Retail Federation said in a statement. Total spending in stores and online is expected to have declined by about 11 percent. Such early numbers suggest that many retailers may be disappointed by the holiday shopping season. “It’s going to be a dogfight for the entire season, every day, every minute,” federation CEO Matthew Shay told The New York Times. “Holiday sales are now a marathon, not a sprint.”
Black Friday promotions at Walmart and other big stores started weeks ago. Cyber Monday deals at Target, J.C. Penney, Staples and Old Navy also have been stretched out. Despite concerns about holiday sales, some brick-and-mortar retailers are reporting a strong increase in online sales. And TV sales are a bright spot with strong demand for the latest ultra  high-def (4K) sets.
Tens of millions of Americans are expected to log on and go shopping today. Since 2010 Cyber Monday has been the busiest online shopping day of the year. Amazon has some of the deepest discounts. “There is anecdotal evidence the discounts Amazon is offering are extraordinary,” 24/7wallst.com says.
Oil prices fell further on global markets, following last week’s decision by OPEC to maintain production levels despite weaker global demand. The price of West Texas crude plunged 10 percent on Friday to well under $70 a barrel for the first time since 2010. Wholesale oil prices have plunged nearly 40 percent since June. While consumers benefit from lower home heating and gasoline prices, OPEC’s stand is a blow to some high-cost U.S. producers that could become unprofitable and go out of business if oil prices stay this low.

Embattled Hill staffer Elizabeth Lauten reportedly resigns after controversial remarksBy Jose A. DelReal and Ed O'Keefe December 1 Follow jdelreal Follow @edatpost
At the 67th anniversary of the National Thanksgiving Turkey presentation on Wednesday, President Obama pardoned two Ohio turkeys that will now live at the home of a former Virginia governor. (AP)
Embattled Hill staffer Elizabeth Lauten has resigned amid a backlash over critical remarks she posted on Facebook Friday about President Obama’s daughters.
Lauten, communications director for Rep. Stephen Lee Fincher (R-Tenn.), came under fire over the weekend after posting derogatory remarks about Sasha and Malia Obama regarding their appearance at the president’s annual Turkey pardoning.
“Dear Sasha and Malia, I get you’re both in those awful teen years, but you’re a part of the First Family, try showing a little class,” Lauten wrote. “Rise to the occasion. Act like being in the White House matters to you. Dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar.”
Lauten confirmed her resignation to The Washington Post on Monday morning.
Several media outlets pointed out that the two girls, ages 16 and 13, appeared bored while their father spoke during Wednesday’s event. The exasperated looks on the pair’s faces were used to gently mock the annual turkey pardon on social media Wednesday and Thursday and drew wry headlines from publications such as USA Today and Gawker.
But Lauten’s comments struck a nerve among critics who accused her of going too far and turning the two girls into political targets. Her original post quickly went viral, inspiring blog posts and tweets condemning her choice of words. She issued an apology on Facebook hours after her initial post.
"When I first posted on Facebook I reacted to an article and I quickly judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager," Lauten wrote Friday. "After many hours of prayer, talking to my parents, and re-reading my words online I can see more clearly just how hurtful my words were."
The president and first lady Michelle Obama have aggressively tried to shield the first daughters from the media spotlight during the family’s six years in the White House. The episode has sparked fresh conversation about the sensitive position the two girls are in as teenagers living in the White House.
While the tenor of Lauten’s comments have been widely condemned, top Republican operatives have also criticized the media’s response, suggesting the coverage has been motivated by political bias.
“Children, especially the first daughters, are off limits. While the comments were inappropriate and insensitive, the mainstream media's coverage of this story is appalling,” said Republican National Committee communications director Sean Spicer in a series of tweets  Monday. “In over 20 years in politics I have never seen 1 of the countless inappropriate comments by Democrats ever covered to a faction [sic] of this.”
Baffling as the rant was, particularly coming from a communications director, this wasn't Lauten's first social media blunder. In August Lauten inadvertently posted a highly personal message on Fincher's official twitter account.
“God I love this song. And beach music. AND shagging #pandora,” said the tweet, which was deleted hours later. Lauten explained afterward that she had intended to post the message on her personal Facebook.

West Bengal government to convert Kalyani jail into a detention centre of Bangladesh immigrantsWritten by Sabyasachi Bandopadhyay | Kolkata |
Posted: December 1, 2014 8:12 pm
The West Bengal Government has finally decided to convert the Kalyani Sub-jail in Nadia district into a detention centre of Bangladesh immigrants who overstayed their prison terms and are languishing in various jails of the state. Home secretary Basudeb Banerjee has written a letter to heads of several depatrments on December 10 requesting them to expedite the matter.
In fact it was following a Supreme Court order in the first week of September that the Centre asked all states to build such detention centres to house Bangladeshi prisoners. By doing this the state government is in fact following the path of states like Punjab which too were going to build detention centres for foreign nationals inside jails.
Earlier the state government was planning to build such a centre at Bongaon, the town in North 24 Parganas district thst borders Bangladesh. But it seems that the state government has taken this initiative because of pressure from the Centre. At present in West Bengal jails out of around 3000 Bangladeshi prisoners, around 600 are ‘Jaan-khalash’ (overstayed their terms) prisoners.
In fact by earmarking a separate jail for Bangladeshi jaan-khalash prisoners the state government is implementing a central government plan that was mooted by the Ministry of Home Affairs during the NDA regime when L. K. Advani was deputy prime minister and home minister.
However the decision to convert the Kalyani sub-jail into a detention centre has triggered much consternation among jail officials who are already burdened with overcrowded jails. “We have received the order. Earlier we heard a separate detention centre will be built at Kalyani. But now we have got this order from the Home depatrment. We don’t know what to do,” one official told Indian Express.
However Hyder Aziz Safi, minister for jails, who has been sidelined by chief minister Mamata Banerjee for his mishandling the affairs of the jail department that came to the fore following the suicide attempt of Trinamool Congress MP Kunal Ghosh, told Indian Express: “I don’t know anything. Let’s see what happens.”

Forensics reveal rat poison in Karnataka school girl death caseBy: Express News Service | Bangalore |
Posted: December 1, 2014 8:10 pm
Three levels of toxicology tests on tissue from the body of a 14-year-old school girl who died under mysterious circumstances on October 30 in the town of Thirthahalli, nearly 300 km from Bangalore, has revealed the presence of substances found in rat poison.
The detection of a large quantity of phosphorus from tissue samples in forensic tests — including the advanced inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry test — has strengthened the theory that the young girl committed suicide and was not abducted, assaulted and forced to drink poison.
The death of the 14-year-old girl at the end of October had created a furore in Karnataka after the opposition BJP had accused the ruling Congress party of protecting three Muslim youths allegedly involved in abducting, assaulting and forcing the young girl to consume poison on October 29.
Investigations by the Criminal Investigation Department of the Karnataka police have so far revealed that the young girl committed suicide because she was upset over being transferred to a new school by her parents for the current academic year. The CID probe has found a suicide note written by the young girl to be genuine. The probe has also found no evidence to substantiate allegations that the girl was abducted, assaulted or forced to consume poison as alleged after the case took a political turn.
The CID probe has found that the young girl concocted a story of abduction for her parents after she played truant from school on October 29 and was found alone at a hillock by some locals. The probe has found that a Muslim youth named by the girl was an innocent person.
While poisoning was suspected to be the cause of the death the CID had been awaiting a formal toxicology report to confirm its findings.
Sources said that the presence of a large amount of phosporous in the tissue samples subjected to toxicology tests indicated that the young girl may have consumed a poison meant for rodents. A small store that the girl’s father owned in Thirthahalli had stocks of rat poison and investigators are looking at whether the girl accessed it, sources said.
The Karnataka government is likely to table a report on the probe into the controversial case in the state legislature next week.

Future is here: How high tech is helping far...(Technology encourages…)
By Quentin Hardy
LEESBURG: Kip Tom, a seventh-generation family farmer, harvests the staples of modern agriculture: seed corn, feed corn, soybeans and data.
"I'm hooked on a drug of information and productivity," he said, sitting in an office filled with computer screens and a whiteboard covered with schematics and plans for his farm's computer network.
Tom, 59, is as much a chief technology officer as he is a farmer. Where his great-great-grandfather hitched a mule, "we've got sensors on the combine, GPS data from satellites, cellular modems on self-driving tractors, apps for irrigation on iPhones," he said.
The demise of the small family farm has been a long time coming. But for farmers like Tom, technology offers a lifeline, a way to navigate the boom-and-bust cycles of making a living from the land. It is also helping them grow to compete with giant agribusinesses.
While some benefit, others will lose. Silicon Valley is credited - or blamed - for tearing down many old ways of doing things. With its adoption of the latest technology, Tom's farm is expanding, to 20,000 acres today from 700 acres in the 1970s. But some of his neighbors' farms are fading away.
Furthermore, such costly technology is beyond the smallest farmers. Equipment makers like John Deere and AGCO, for example, have covered their planters, tractors and harvesters with sensors, computers and communications equipment. A combine equipped to harvest a few crops cost perhaps $65,000 in 2000; now it goes for as much as $500,000 because of the added information technology.
"We've seen a big uptick in the productivity of larger farms," said David Schimmelpfennig, an economist at the Agriculture Department. "It's not that smaller farms are less productive, but the big ones can afford these technology investments."
And there is another risk. There is an incentive to grow single crops to maximize the effectiveness of technology by growing them at the largest possible scale. Farmers with diverse crops and livestock would need many different systems. Smaller farmers without technology could also grow one crop, but they would not capture most of the gains.
Technology encourages farmers to move too aggressively toward easy-to-grow and easy-to-sell crops that are more easily measured by instruments, rather than keeping some diversity in the fields - an age-old hedge against bad weather and pests, said Ann Thrupp, executive director of the Berkeley Food Institute, a policy and technology research institute at the University of California, Berkeley.
That is the fear. But there is also the promise that technology can make farming far easier. Like Tom Farms, other farms have also grown with the adoption of technology.
At a large family farm in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, Brian Braswell uses satellite-connected tractors to plow fields with accuracy of one inch between furrows. His soil was tested with electrical charges, then mapped so that fertilizer is applied in exact doses from computer-controlled machines. He uses drones, the newest new thing, to survey flood irrigation.
"It would be easy to put an infrared camera on one of these and spot where crops are stressed," he said, except that he's wary of Federal Aviation Administration regulations.
Brent Schipper takes data readings from his combine every three seconds at his 6,000-acre farm near Conrad, Iowa. In the storm season, he checks the weather app on his smartphone every 30 minutes. With the harvest in, he and other farmers who used to spend winters resting and repairing machines will be adding new sensors to their equipment, and poring over last season's data, hoping to get an edge on the next season.
And at Iowa State University in Ames, a professor, Lie Tang, hopes to have his prototype weeding robot in fields by next spring.
The robot may use infrared data to help identify weeds it then plucks.
In the past, "a farmer with 1,000 acres could make a good living," Tom said. "I'm not sure that's going to last."
Tom Farms has genetically modified crops, cloud-computing systems and possibly soon drones, if Tom does not go with lasers on low-orbit satellites. All of these items will be sending their data for analysis on the cloud-computing systems that Tom Farms rented from Monsanto and other companies.
"Farmers still think tech means physical augmentation - more horsepower, more fertilizer," Tom said. "They don't see that technology now is about multiplying information." With corn prices at almost half the level they have been in the past few years, "my growth is going to come from farmers who don't embrace technology."
  From a self-driving John Deere combine, Ernie Burbrink, a Tom Farms employee, sorts real-time data about moisture, yields and net bushels per acre on his iPad, sending important information by wireless modem to distant cages of computer servers that begin analyzing the data for next season's planting.

CSR be made integral part of cos core strategy: Study

Post your opinion here
 
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) should be made an integral part of the core strategy of companies so as to help them identify right social schemes and beneficiaries, a survey said Monday.
The survey said that around 28 percent of companies feel that identifying appropriate social projects and their beneficiaries is a key challenge while implementing CSR
programmes.
Hence, CSR should be made an integral part of core strategic thinking and corporate value creation rather than just a 'tick the box' activity, the survey by Dun & Bradstreet
said.
There is a need to create awareness amongst Indian companies on how CSR can be an extension of good corporate governance, it said.
The recent enactment of the New Companies Act mandates 2 percent compulsory CSR spend from their profit by companies.
"The legislation of CSR is pathbreaking. For a country like India, it represents a leap of faith, and our belief is that the special qualities that the private sector has - efficiency, innovation, ability to carry out projects which can be harnessed through CSR in the social development of our country," said Bhaskar Chatterjee, Director General & CEO, Indian Institute of Corporate Affairs.

Thanksgiving is apparently the only thing that can mess up Mitt Romneys hairBy Jaime Fuller December 1 Follow @j_fuller
It is rare to see an American after Thanksgiving in the wild. They burrow into the couch until the meat sweats pass and the football game is turned off, after which they promptly go to bed. When they rise in the morning, the moment has passed and cannot be captured again until the next season of thanks ... or that afternoon, when at least three turkey and stuffing sandwiches are consumed.
Several canny nature photographers have managed to capture this elusive creature.
You will know that a post-Thanksgiving American is in your midst if you see a sedentary person who looks like Bill Paxton at the end of Twister. If you're still unsure, look at said scientific specimen's' significant other. Are they looking at the post-Thanksgiving American in horror?
Have animals assumed the person in question is a tree? If you have said yes to all these things, you are definitely dealing with a post-Thanksgiving American.

No smartphone service Fewer traffic crashesBy Ashley Halsey III December 1 Follow @ashleyhalsey3rd
(Linda Davidson/ The Washington Post)
Use of BlackBerry smartphones has declined in the U.S., but they still hold 44 percent of the market in Abu Dhabi. So, when service for the devices was disrupted for three days last month, there were a lot of unhappy people.
In the aftermath, police discovered that during the blackout, traffic accidents fell by 20 percent in Dubai and 40 percent nationwide. The chief of police and the head of the traffic division both linked the drop to the outage, which cost BlackBerry owners access to email, text messages and internet functions.
“The accidents that occur from the use of these devices range between minor and moderate ones, but at times they are deadly,” Police Chief Lt. Gen. Dahi Khalfan Tamim told The National in the United Arab Emirates.
The UAE has the eighth highest accident rate in the world, with an accident every three minutes and a fatality every two days. The Abu Dhabi Traffic Department has said that 14 percent of accidents are caused by drivers using smart phones.
A popular international soccer star, Theyab Amana, died this year when he crashed into the back of a road-marking truck, reportedly while using a BlackBerry. Police say that more than 36,000 fines have been handed out in the emirate this year to drivers using their smartphones.

As expected. I think, OMCs are all confused about the rates, it may or may not sustain.. so sudden spikes should be control. There is no clear policy on deregulation. This should be well thought and going forward well educated to public otherwise it will effect to govt in long term.
Going forward we need check how rates should be, They should give some chart or create chart on rate (including and excluding tax) starting from crude 50 to 150$ & should stick and pass on to public, But short term, OMCs are too hot, no stopping for them specially HPCL for its valuation.

On the Darren Wilson Grand Jury Decisionreddit
This is a sad day.
The grand jury's decision is yet another sign that all of America's sons' lives are not yet valued equally in the eyes of our courts. All of America's fathers, mothers and children should stay outraged and in motion for progress until we are finally what we say we are: One Nation, Under God, Indivisible, with Liberty and Justice for All.
We must finally ensure police can be held accountable for killing unarmed civilians. We must win national standards for both the use of force and use of force training. We must require the use of body cameras on police officers. We must force the removal of any mayor or police chief who cannot ensure the minimum requirement of any public safety agenda: that the police uphold their oath and protect and respect the lives of all civilians. The time has long since come for the behavior of America's police to reflect her people's values by respecting the sanctity of each of our lives no matter our race, gender, or class.
The path to these goals is focused advocacy and, where necessary, non-violent direct action. Those are the strategies that led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act and Civil Rights Acts 50 years ago and the outlawing of racial profiling in New York City just two years ago.
Today we are all Michael Brown. Tomorrow we must ensure each of our lives is valued equally in the eyes of our nation's laws, law enforcement officers, and courts.

Recall  TSB or customer service campaign: What s the difference0
A “customer service campaign” can also be referred to as a “secret warranty” because in some cases the only ones who find out about them are those that complain to dealers.
A “customer service campaign” doesn’t conform to NHTSA notification rules. The problem is not considered to be a safety issue, and the automaker issues one to address complaints and keep the customer happy, according to Consumer Reports . Service campaigns often cover widespread problems that occur after the warranty expires.
In terms of severity of safety risk, a customer service campaign is the least problematic; a TSB is reported to NHTSA but not necessarily to car owners and typically cover a new car quirk; a recall is a safety defect that must be fixed and customers must be notified.
Earlier this week, Consumer Reports urged Toyota to upgrade its customer service campaign for power brake defects in 2007 to 2011 Camry Hybrids to a recall.  The campaign was a response to consumer complaints being investigated by the NHTSA.
In some cases, manufacturers do notify owners of TSBs and service campaigns. Nissan, for example, informed buyers of 2013 Altima sedans and Pathfinder SUVs that a belt in the continuously variable automatic transmission could slip and damage the transmission. Nissan encouraged owners to bring their vehicle to a dealer to reprogram the transmission’s electronic controls at no charge.
Consumers can find a list of TSBs for their vehicle online at the same site where the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration posts safety recalls .
Manufacturers typically issue more TSBs in the first model year of a new or redesigned vehicle when, despite extensive pre-production testing, they discover design, engineering and manufacturing flaws after the vehicles are exposed to the ultimate test – being driven in the real world. The number of TSBs usually falls in the second year and often continues to decline in subsequent years.
When the Altima, for example, was redesigned for the 2013 model year, Nissan issued 24 TSBs for the new sedan. So far for the 2014 Altima, only four have been issued. The Ford Escape SUV also was redesigned for 2013, and Ford issued 39 TSBs for that year but only 22 so far for 2014 models.
Repairs or adjustments covered by TSBs are done at no cost to the vehicle owner and usually can be performed as long as the vehicle is still covered by the basic warranty. Some TSBs or service campaigns may have time limits.

Glass apart: The question before us: Will GG simply replicate mobility banking on a wearable device or give us something new? Giuseppe Costantino/shutterstock.com
A feel of wearable devices that change the way you do your banking
The next big thing in mobility devices that can change the dynamics of the banking sector is the Google Glass (let us call it GG). The GG has undeniably expanded the horizon of thought for banks, as well as other businesses.
This innovation in technology brings up interesting options for customer engagement and has the potential to disrupt engagement to an inspirational level. The GG (or wearables) is business-centric and will definitely improve productivity.
The question before us is: Will GG simply replicate mobility banking on a wearable device? Not in my opinion.
And those wanting to know what makes it a disruptor can find the answer at https://www.google.com/glass/start/what- it-does/. The three themes of GG – Be Active, Explore Your World and Live Lighter say it all.
Now, if banking services were to be embedded into each of these themes, look at the dimensions that emerge.
One can do active banking without disengagement, explore the world with the bank in tow and live a lighter (more pleasurable) banking experience.
The wearables market is growing rapidly and will revolutionise lifestyle.
Banks will have to be part of this lifestyle to stay relevant to customers. Quoting from PRNewswire “The global wearable computing market will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 43.4 per cent from around $5 billion forecast for 2013 to $9.2 billion in 2014 and more than $30.2 billion forecast for 2018.” The numbers are in black and white and there’s no ignoring them.
The following use cases of proactive engagement illustrate the power of GG in retail banking.
However, some of these will need apps to leverage GG’s native functionality.
A case for marketing
John D is a busy person. He has to accomplish a few tasks in his to-do list for the day. One is to open a deposit account that pays higher interest. He is unhappy with the rate of interest paid by his current bank on his deposit account.
A bank salesperson walks around a mall and gets into a conversation with John D, a prospect. The talk moves to banking products. At a strategic point, the salesperson offers John a GG to scan products; together, they co-browse, match products to needs, discuss some more and close the sale. John issues voice instructions to transfer money to his new deposit account.
One can easily see that this approach is more effective than sending unsolicited alerts or mailing a portfolio of brochures. GG offers the right mix of human contact and technology to personalise experience.
Gamification
Sheila S has registered for an undergrad course at a university. She is planning on taking a student loan for financing her studies. She does not know much about students’ loan. She will take a decision once she understands how it works. She is planning on talking to her Bank Manager later in the week. Sheila S is browsing through the day’s news on her GG. Spotting an advertisement for a student loan from one of the local banks, she launches the gamification app and plays around. As she games, she has the option of entering into a video/audio conversation to enhance the engagement with the bank’s advisor. The cool gaming app has won the bank a new customer.
In general, a bank can develop gamification apps for products, which are far more engaging than the boring tools and calculators that one sees today.
Financial Planning
Mike H has, for long, postponed his investment planning. He discussed this with his friend over dinner. He decides on setting the plan and completing his investment in the next two days.
Mike H is in his country retreat relaxing by the poolside. He just heard about his friend’s financial planning. His GG gives him the power of anytime, anywhere, access to the bank’s financial planning app. Next, he needs professional advice to organise his investment portfolio. Mike converses with the bank’s financial advisor using the audio/video trigger and selects a set of products from the catalogue and gets his portfolio in place.
Once done, he sits back and relaxes.
The HNI Customer
PC plans his holidays perfectly. His second passion is golf that takes him to the best courses around the globe. His first passion remains investments. He always prides himself on the fact that his portfolio beats the index. PC, (a premium high net worth customer) is active and exploring the world. He reads on his GG that the stock market has unexpectedly turned volatile. He then checks his investment portfolio and decides to quickly restructure it.
PC gets into a conference with his relationship manager at that very instant and instructs him on the change. Using GG, they collaborate and co-browse new portfolios and simulate returns. Finally, they arrive at an optimised portfolio. Once done, PC resumes his explorations without interruptions.
This is the first of a two-part series on the power of GG in retail banking

Krishnakumar Natarajan, MD & CEO, Mindtree | Best CEO: IT/ITES (Mid-sized companies) | (Photo: Nilotpal Baruah)
Amiable, convivial and genial are some of the adjectives used to describe Krishnakumar Natarajan, or KK, the easygoing CEO of Mindtree . In January 2011, though, nothing was going easy for the Bangalore-based IT and outsourcing company, which was co-founded by KK, Ashok Soota, one of Indian IT's grand old man, among others, in 1999. Soota, who was then the Executive Chairman, decided to part ways with Mindtree (KK was the CEO), and there were questions on whether the company would survive, let alone thrive.
Fast forward to 2014, and the company has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 27 per cent in revenues and 65 per cent in profit after tax over the last three years, handsomely beating the industry average and its peers. And if you were savvy enough to bet on the company, when it was hammered in February 2011, it would have given you a 364 per cent return compared to a 55 per cent return for the Bombay Stock Exchange's benchmark Sensex or a 63 per cent return for the more comparable BSE technology index.
About Krishnakumar Natarajan
So, how did KK, 57, manage to turbocharge growth just when the markets had turned negative on his company? For this it is important to understand KK's background. Beneath the ever smiling face is a steely resolve which is deployed when it matters. He realised this when he was in Class X (matriculation), a rite of passage for students in India, which helps them determine their future. An average student in his own words, KK suddenly decided to focus on his studies one day without any goading of his railway doctor father and homemaker mother. When the results came out, he had not only topped his school but also came 12th in Tamil Nadu. "That is when I realised that if I set my mind to something I could achieve it. There was no trigger or push factor. I just felt I wanted to do it and I did it," he says.
When he joined College of Engineering, Guindy, in Tamil Nadu, his love for sports, table tennis and badminton in particular, combined with excellence in academics, meant that he was very popular and was elected president of the college union in his final year. The college, which came under the University of Madras, was later renamed Anna University. This had a deleterious impact on the students who wanted to go abroad to study - the University of Madras brand was well accepted, but Anna's was new. So students requested that for those who had already enrolled, certificates should be issued under the University of Madras moniker, a demand which was refused. When the then President of India was supposed to visit the university, KK called for a strike to have their demand acceded to. The college authorities were forced to oblige. "When required I can take tough decisions. One need not thump the table and raise the voice to be effective," avers KK.
After engineering and an MBA from XLRI, Jamshedpur, KK says he had job offers from Tata Burroughs, HCL and ORG (Operations Research Group), an IT company promoted by Sarabhai family. He chose ORG, but when the promoters did not show much inclination towards the business, Ashok Narasimhan, the man who kickstarted Wipro's IT foray, hired him. KK worked with Wipro from 1982 to 1999 and was responsible for growing the company's e-commerce and financial solutions business. He also served as the HR head of company's IT services division. It was at Wipro that KK met his wife, Akila, who now heads Social Venture Partners.
At Mindtree , KK had to once move against his one-time boss and mentor Soota when strategic differences arose among its founders on where the company should invest its time and resources in. "It was not easy (to go against) Ashok. After all, he was my boss at Wipro and, more than that, somebody whom I respect and like. But in the larger interest of the company and other stakeholders, I had to take some tough decisions and I did," said KK.
After Soota left, Mindtree had to quickly reinvent its strategy to stay relevant. A big part of that move was to focus on select areas and hack through internal layers, to bring the company closer to customers. That meant letting go of a 'long tail' of customers. From about 306 customers, the company pruned the list to around 200. "Some of the customers were too small. We looked at whether there was scope for a long term relationship and if we could scale. Also, another factor was what we would learn from the engagement. If none of the right brackets ticked, we had to let them go and focus on our other customers," said KK.
"I didn't want to load up on debt. There is room for everybody, large, mid and small firms. Mindtree's greatest testament comes from our growing number of satisfied customers"
Instead of competing with large players in all segments head on, Mindtree stressed on areas such as testing and application maintenance, travel, hospitality, among others, where it could hope to emerge as a player of some size and scale.
As Sudin Apte, Research Director and CEO at Offshore Insights, a sourcing advisory firm, says: "It [Mindtree] clearly has made some smart moves, which have paid off. But it has a long way to go. Remember its original promise was to become a $1 billion in revenue company by 2014 and they are just over half of that. Meanwhile, even the goalpost on what constitutes a Tier-II company has moved. Now Tier-I players are $10 billion-plus in revenue and Tier-II are $1 billion-plus in revenue. They are an interesting Tier-III player."
The other nominees: IT/ITES (Mid-sized companies)
Sanchit Vir Gogia, Chief Analyst and CEO at Greyhound Research, says while KK has done a good job of holding the company together and steering it onto a path of high growth, more needs to be done. "It [Mindtree] may compete with a Virtusa (another IT firm of similar size) and win a contract, but the IT outsourcing and offshoring story is fundamentally shifting, and Mindtree needs to invest in emerging areas quickly if it wants to sustain growth and margins. It has to seriously explore larger inorganic growth strategies."
KK, however, feels Mindtree was not in a position to make such large moves when both Satyam Computer and Patni [acquisition] opportunities came up. "I didn't want to load up on debt. There is room for everybody, large, mid and small firms. Mindtree's greatest testament comes from our growing number of satisfied customers."
In a game of table tennis, KK has clearly come back from behind to win a 'set', but whether he can win the match for Mindtree, remains to be seen.

A simple guide to the sudden collapse in oil pricesBy Chris Mooney December 1 Follow chriscmooney
An oil well near Tioga, North Dakota. (AFP PHOTO/ Karen BLEIER/Getty Images)
Oil prices  dropped further  in trading overnight before appearing to recover  some of the losses, as part of an ongoing energy market roller-coaster that has seen prices for West Texas Intermediate crude oil -- often used as a benchmark of U.S. prices -- drop below $70 per barrel  for the first time since 2010. In recent months, markets have seen a  dramatic price slump  for oil, which cost over $100 per barrel as recently as June.
The shift has markedly reduced average U.S. gasoline prices (which are now well below $3 per gallon ) and may bolster the U.S. economy heading into the Christmas spending season -- by putting considerably more money in consumers' wallets.
But what's driving this slump -- which is quickly becoming the single most important economic story of 2014 (and maybe 2015)? There's one short-term reason and three longer-term reasons.
The most immediate reason is that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries -- a  group of 12 nations including Saudi Arabia, Iran and Venezuela that holds enormous power over global energy markets, producing 40 percent of global oil supply  --   decided  on Thursday not to cut production at their meeting in Vienna.
Credit: NASDAQ .
The meeting was the most important in years, because it came amid a pre-existing slump in prices. Everybody wanted to know if OPEC would take any action to halt the decline. It didn't -- presumably because its members decided it was wiser to weather the current storm -- and crude oil prices immediately tanked.
The long term reasons include booming U.S. and world oil production, little demand in Europe and Japan, and improving automobile fuel efficiency standards.
1) Booming U.S. and world oil production. Even as OPEC kept production steady, it has been growing elsewhere. The United States, most of all, has seen a major growth in oil production, thanks to the shale oil revolution, in which new technologies like horizontal drilling have allowed access to hydrocarbons deep beneath the Earth's surface.
The figures from the Energy Information Administration are truly dramatic: Almost twice as many barrels a day of crude oil are being produced now in the U.S., versus the mid-2000s:
Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration .
Production of oil has also been up in  many other countries . Canada increased its crude oil production from just over 2.5 million barrels per day in 2009 to over 3.3 million in 2013, and Russia increased from about 9.5 million barrels per day in 2009 to over 10 million barrels per day over the same time period. Libya, meanwhile, is bouncing back after production tanked in 2011 due to the country's civil war.
In sum, there's just more oil out there for people to buy, which is having a predictable effect on prices, pushing them downward.
2. Little demand in many regions including Japan and Europe. There's also the fact that while the U.S. has recovered steadily from the Great Recession, many other countries have not. They're struggling, and that is dampening oil demand.
In  Europe , for instance, while total petroleum consumption averaged over 15.3 million barrels per day in 2009, it was under 14.3 million in 2013, and has dropped further since.
There's a similar story to be told about Japan:
Source: U.S.  Energy Information Administration .
3. Strides in vehicle fuel efficiency. In the U.S., we're also using less fuel in our cars because those cars are more efficient . The sales-weighted fuel economy of vehicles in the U.S. increased from 20.8 miles per gallon in 2008 to 25.3 miles per gallon in 2014.
Here's a figure from the Energy Information Administration that captures the trend:
So in sum, it would seem that the trend in oil prices is  due to that most basic of economic factors: Supply and demand.
So what happens next?
Does the slump continue, or is it possible we've already overshot and are due for a reversal in oil prices? We can't be sure, but there are some reasons to think a bounceback could be possible, especially if there's a European economic recovery. And in the long term, overall fuel consumption is definitely  projected to increase, not decline, out towards 2040 -- driven largely by demand in developing nations.
For shale oil in the U.S., permits for new wells dropped 15 percent in October, the first sign of a slowdown, according to Reuters. Sliding oil prices have also hurt prices of U.S. corporate junk bond funds. (Reuters)

Unfortunately for voters, the $3.7 billion spent over the most recent election cycle did not come with a gift receipt. Despite being rung up as the most expensive midterm in US history, nearly two-thirds of Americans sat out the election -- the lowest voter turnout in more than 70 years . Those who didn't turn-out were disproportionately low-income people , who are increasingly shut out of the political process. It makes sense to see growing disillusionment with politics alongside massive outside spending, since the interests of ultra-wealthy donors are unlikely to reflect the experiences of most citizens. On issues like the minimum wage, the divergence can be stark. That is one reason why low-wage retail workers are making their case for better working conditions in big-box parking lots for the third straight year of Black Friday strikes . They need a public forum on the Walmart economy, and big-box retail took the last one on the shelf.
In our recent paper, Retail Politics: How America's Big-Box Retailers Turn Their Economic Power into Political Influence , we found that the six largest big-box retailers in the US spent $30 million on campaign contributions and lobbying during the latest election cycle -- that's six times more than they spent in 2000. Walmart and Home Depot, in particular, rank among the top campaign spenders in the nation. And this spending is not like consumption spending on, say, some cheap imported merchandise , it is an investment with real returns.
Political spending of big business is as much about flooding the process with friendly faces as it is about establishing access once the election is over. The campaign and committee donations of wealthy interests first fill the playing field with candidates who share their priorities, and then elevate the issues they care about most. Over time, big-box retailers have supported Republicans over Democrats by a clear margin of 2-to1. But in the 2014 cycle these companies spent their political dollars widely, giving on both sides of the aisle -- and even donating to opposing candidates in contested races.
This campaign spending combines with millions of dollars in lobbying to allow those with the fattest wallets to shape the country's political agenda. As a result, the small population of affluent Americans sees their priorities reflected in our legislative objectives, even when the majority of the country disagrees with their preferences. For example, taxes were the most frequently lobbied issue by big-box retailers in 2014 by a large margin. This legislative area has proven lucrative for business in the past -- experts in corporate strategy research show that a 1 percent increase in businesses lobbying expenditures yields a lower effective tax rate of between 0.5 and 1.6 percent for the firm. Yet when there is conflict between big corporations and other interests over policy change, policy sides with big business lobbyists the vast majority of the time.
Meanwhile, the increase in big-box retail's political spending occurred at the same time that the most important lobby for workers floundered. Previous research by our organization, Demos, has found that unions are the only interest group that consistently lobbies in the interests of average Americans. However, data from the Center for Responsive Politics show that business interests outspend unions 15 to 1. The democratic chorus in Washington has shifted from one that is broadly in favor of business interests to one virtually devoid of any other voices. It is unsurprising in this context that after an almost two-decade fall, the share of Americans saying that government is "run by a few big interests," is as high as 70 percent.
That loss of trust in the equal democratic voice for all Americans also reflects where the money is. According to data from American National Election Studies, unskilled workers  are more likely to agree that government is run by a few big interests than their white collar and professional peers. That perception is reinforced by the escalating importance of private money in elections, and it shows an intuitive read of the very real problems with democracy, like research that suggests the preferences of average Americans simply won't change much in Washington.
There are no Black Friday bargains when it comes to political contributions, but there are ways to make small-dollar donations matter more to those on the receiving end. Public finance , federal matching of small donors and effective lobbying regulations can amplify the voices currently drowned out by big money, and begin assuring Americans that democracy is not for sale.

London mayors U.S. tax bill an expensive bout of expatriate painBy Adam Taylor November 29 Follow @mradamtaylor
London Mayor Boris Johnson stands with his "Bear of London" Paddington Bear statue at City Hall on Nov. 3. (Ian Gavan/Getty Images)
Boris Johnson's has the unique ability to be ridiculous and charming at the same time. The London mayor and his inexplicable haircut can offend entire cities , get stuck on zip lines in front of crowds of journalists  and be sacked from government for lying about an affair ("an inverted pyramid of piffle," he claimed), yet still somehow end up one of Britain's most important and beloved politicians. Many think he will be prime minister sooner or later.
However, Johnson's charm may well fall flat with one organization: The U.S. Internal Revenue Service.
The mayor's dispute with American tax-collectors was brought to light recently when he traveled to the United States and did a blitz of interviews with the American news media. While talking to  WAMU's Diane Rehm Show , Johnson explained that the U.S. government was forcing him to pay the capital gains tax on the sale of his Islington home. "Can you believe it?" he exclaimed. When asked by Rehm if he intended to pay the bill, he said that he would not. "I think it's absolutely outrageous," he added.
Johnson's problem comes down to one important factor: His dual-citizenship. Despite being very, very British, Johnson was born in New York and lived in the United States until he was 5, hence becoming a natural born citizen. And despite some threats to renounce his citizenship ("After 42 happy years I am getting a divorce from America," he wrote in 2006 after a spat with a U.S. immigration officer), he renewed his U.S. passport just two years ago.
It's certainly tempting to dismiss Johnson's dilemma as the simple case of a very rich man attempting to float the law ("Come on, Boris!," the New York Times's  Roger Cohen wrote this week . "Give us a break.") but there is a degree of sympathy to be found here: American citizenship carries with it a uniquely vexing taxation problem. The United States is one of only two countries where taxation is based on citizenship rather than residence (Eritrea is the other). If Johnson lived in the United States, for instance, he would not have to file a British tax return.
The unusual U.S. policy dates back to the Civil War and the Revenue Act of 1862, which called for the taxing of American citizens abroad, in part to punish men who fled the country to avoid joining the Union army.
In practice, this is usually often just an annoying bit of paperwork for foreigners -- while the average citizen would have to file a tax return, it's unlikely they'll have to pay anything. However, it can become expensive for higher earners, especially when tax laws don't line up. As Lisa Pollack, an American expat herself,  explains for the Financial Times , this is what appears to have happened for poor old Boris:
In the U.K., gain on the sale of one’s home is not subject to tax. In the U.S., a gain above $250,000 (for a single filer) is subject to capital gains tax. Also in the US, home ownership is subsidised by a deduction against income of mortgage interest. In short, the countries have different tax breaks on housing.
Johnson's U.S. tax bill for the sale of his home in London is thought to be in six figures . Given that the home is in the country he lives and works in, and he has not lived in the U.S. since he was 5, you can see why he thinks it's "outrageous."
Johnson does have the option of giving up his citizenship. If he did so, he would be joining a growing number of Americans: Last year 2,999 people renounced their American citizenship or green card status, the largest number ever revealed by the U.S. government, and its thought that number may end up being higher this year. The United States recently increased the administrative fee for renouncing one's citizenship from $450 to $2,350, in what is unlikely to be a coincidence.
Experts believe that the increasing number of Americans renouncing their citizenship is due to a 2010 law called the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATC), which forced foreign banks to help claim back tax money from U.S. citizens living abroad. FATC has become a deeply unpopular with American expatriates. So far, it's thought that the campaign has netted the U.S. Treasury $6 billion, the Wall Street Journal reports .
There are significant upsides to being a U.S. citizen, of course, and if Johnson wants to keep his passport, perhaps he could kick up a fuss. He might point toward the fact that the U.S. Embassy in London owes more than $10 million in fines related to the city's congestion charge. He could also side with the legal battle being started by other expats against America's taxation policies and the foreign governments that work with them.
Better still, he could put his very expensive citizenship to use: As an American citizen who was born in the United States, Johnson could one day run for president. His absurd charm could well win over American voters, too.
Correction: This article originally referred to Johnson as a naturalized citizen, rather than a natural born citizen. It has been corrected.

Black Friday deals today: How to be a smart online shopperComments
It's the big date you just cannot afford to forget. And you don't have to be a hardcore shopaholic to feel that adrenaline rush. The annual shopping extravaganza, called Black Friday, is 28th November, and it promises some of the most outlandishly cheap deals the click of a mouse. Big screen TV’s for less than $300 (Rs 18,000), designer bags at 40% discounts, and SLR cameras at the price of cheap point-and-click ones are only a few examples.
But for Indian shopaholics here is one big issue though: These deals are mostly available only in the US. Therefore getting access to these deals means reliance on a relative residing there. But the advent of online shopping and global shipping services means you too now be part of this shopping madness.
Here are a few useful tips and hacks to help you get your hands on the best ‘Black Friday’ deals
1. Cyber Monday: While ‘Black Friday’ is the marquee shopping day when retail stores offer big discounts, don’t lose hope if you miss out. Some of the best deals of the week, especially on electronics, are available on ‘Cyber Monday’ (1st December). Most importantly ‘Cyber Monday’ deals are exclusive to online stores like Amazon and eBay which makes it’s easier to order.
2. Global Shipping: Try to make your purchases from site that offer shipping to India. Sites such as Amazon US, eBay and Newegg ship most of their goods to India and will be upfront with the cost of shipping and customs before you check out. This ensures some degree of safeguard against loss or steep customs on arrival.
3. Package forwarding services: Now try as hard as you might, many items on sale simply won’t offer worldwide shipping. But there is a work around for this: Try package forwarding services who get the product delivered to their local warehouse and then ship it on their own to customers abroad. Mind you, these services are not free and require you to provide ID and other documents. You can choose services offered by banks like MyUS(HDFC), Borderlinx (Citibank), Global eShop(ICICI) or use third party services like ShopNShip and Viabox.
4. Shipping and customs:  Always take shipping and customs into account before you make the purchase. In some cases it will be cheaper to buy locally than order from the US if shipping and customs are steep. The best way to deal with this is to pick a shipping service that’ll charge for customs up front and will clear it from customs if need be.

Body Found Amid Search For Missing Ohio State Football PlayerBody Found Amid Search For Missing Ohio State Football Player
 | By                                                                RUSTY MILLER and LISA CORNWELL

COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — An Ohio State football player who disappeared shortly after sending a text message about his concussions was found dead Sunday in a dumpster, apparently of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said.
Police spokesman Sgt. Rich Weiner said police received a call around 2:30 p.m. from someone reporting a body found in the trash bin. Weiner said a woman and her son apparently were looking for items in the dumpster when they found the body.
"At this time we are able to confirm through tattoos here at the scene that it is the body of Kosta Karageorge," Weiner said.
The police spokesman said the preliminary investigation showed that Karageorge apparently died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He said a handgun was found in the dumpster.
Police found the body near the campus after a search began when Karageorge went missing Wednesday. The senior defensive tackle had last been seen at his apartment in Columbus, when his roommates said he left to go on a walk.
The body was found within a couple hundred yards of Karageorge's home and about a half block from High Street, the main artery of the campus. Sunday evening, no one answered when an Associated Press reporter knocked on the metal door of Karageorge's apartment.
Karageorge's parents filed a missing-person report Wednesday evening, and his mother, Susan Karageorge, told police he had had several concussions and a few spells of being extremely confused, according to the report. She said that at about 1:30 a.m. Wednesday he texted a message apologizing and saying the concussions had messed up his head. "I am sorry if I am an embarrassment," he said.
A woman answering the phone Sunday at Susan Karageorge's home identified herself as a friend and said that neither Susan Karageorge nor other family members had any comment.
University athletic officials said they were grieved to learn of Karageorge's death.
"It's hit the team hard," team spokesman Jerry Emig said.
Ohio State Athletic Director Gene Smith said in a text message when asked about any plans to honor the player or logistics for the team to attend the funeral that it was too soon to answer those questions. The Buckeyes will play Wisconsin in the Big Ten championship game Saturday at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis.
A former Ohio State wrestler, Karageorge joined the football team as a walk-on this season. He played in one game and was among two dozen seniors slated to be recognized at the final home game Saturday against rival Michigan. The Buckeyes won, 42-28.
At the game, starting defensive tackle Michael Bennett spoke fondly of Karageorge.
"He's got a great personality, one of the favorite people I've ever met — just an interesting guy and a big heart," Bennett said.
During halftime at the No. 16 Ohio State men's basketball game against James Madison in Columbus, pictures of Karageorge were shown and an announcement was made urging people with any information to contact police.
After Karageorge went missing, the team's physician, Dr. Jim Borchers, said he could not comment on the medical care of student athletes. But, he added, "We are confident in our medical procedures and policies to return athletes to participation following injury or illness."
The player's sister, Sophia Karageorge, told The Columbus Dispatch that he apparently was upset, and roommates said he went for a walk, dressed in black from his hat to his boots.
"We're very concerned that he's not himself and that he maybe doesn't know what's going on," she told the newspaper.
She said after each concussion he followed trainers' instructions and received proper care but "his repercussions from (concussions) have been long-term or delayed."
She said he was without his wallet and his motorcycle.
Coach Urban Meyer described Karageorge as a hard worker and an important player in practice.

Will RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan succumb to pressure to cut ratesWill RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan succumb to pressure to cut rates?
Manojit Saha | Mumbai Dec 01, 2014 09:28 AM IST
Tuesday    will be a litmus test for an economist with unquestionable credentials. Come December 2,  Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan’s resolve to fight inflation will be tested against the backdrop of finance ministry’s constant soundbytes to do otherwise.
 
Pressure from the mandarins at North Block – where the Finance Ministry is housed – is not new for a central bank governor. Both Rajan’s and current finance minister Arun Jaitley’s predecessors were often at loggerheads openly, sometimes through TV appearances or the written word.
 
Jaitley’s predecessor Pallaniappan Chidambaram once famously said when Duvvuri Subbarao declined to cut rates that the government would walk alone to revive growth. To which Subbarao’s parting shot was ‘Let Chidambaram take a walk but he will thank that the RBI exists.’
 
While Chidambaram - a lawyer by profession  - was keen to portray himself no less than a super regulator, his predecessor was less ‘hands on’. Pranab Mukherjee, the then finance minister and now President of the country, left the job of managing government banks to the bureaucrats, particularly to one DK Mittal who was the then financial services secretary. He shot to fame by sending instructions to public sector bank chairmen almost every day, thereby encroaching on the ‘turf’ of RBI which is the constitutional body to regulate banks in India. Later, a committee appointed by Rajan and headed by former Axis Bank chairman P J Nayak, and a former bureaucrat in the finance ministry, pointed out the need to end dual regulation because it crippled the functioning of PSBs.
 
Then, too, the finance ministry never quite liked the idea of the RBI governor crossing the street, quite literally, to visit South Block – where the prime minister’s office is located – after the customary pre-policy meeting with the finance minister.
 
So why should we expect Jaitley to be different? There is absolutely no reason, even if Jaitley is not seen as ‘hands on’ or known for ‘handpicking’ secretaries, (which is now done by the prime minister himself).
 
However, in the the last one month of his five-month tenure, Jaitley increasing looks like his ‘super regulator’ predecessors. He has made it a habit of giving the same soundbytes to the media like his predecessors on why RBI should cut interest rates.
 
That is why this is the first time that Rajan, the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is facing perhaps the toughest test in his one and a quarter year tenure at Mint Road. This will likely be a tougher battle than the currency crisis that India won hands down or the inflation battle which Rajan is on the verge of winning – retail inflation has fallen from double digits to below 6% in 13 months. 
 
It has been proved beyond any iota of doubt that previous finance ministers miscalculated the ferocity of inflation which impoverished the marginal sections of society for about three years now. 
 
It is best left to the governor of central bank who is better equipped to tackle it. To quote Rajan himself: “Let’s fight the battle against inflation once and win.”

Wicked  police: It s not film industry s creation  Mr Modi'Wicked' police: It's not film industry's creation, Mr Modi
Vishwas | Mumbai Dec 01, 2014 11:24 AM IST
"I'm not against the police; I'm just afraid of them."
When Alfred Hitchcock said this, he had probably not overdosed himself with Indian movies that have been accused by Prime Minister Narendra Modi of focusing only on bad cops.
For those who kept themselves away from news on a lazy Sunday, a little context would be helpful: Prime Minister Modi has said cinema has created a "very bad image" of the police in the minds of the common man.
At the 49th annual conference of DGPs hosted by the Intelligence Bureau in Guwahati, Modi said: "The film industry has created a very bad image of the police in the minds of the common man and I ask them why? Yes, there may be some shortcomings, but should only that be highlighted? Is it not our duty to remove these shortcomings by bringing into light the positive and good things.
"The image of films on the common man is immense and without their cooperation, policing cannot be successful. We must think about long-term strategy to change the thoughts and perception of the common people based on reality."
You ask anybody in this country. Most of the people will tell you: if you can, stay as far as possible from the police.
The common man is not hallucinating when he thinks the police cannot be trusted. Even in a survey by Transparency International and the Centre for Media Studies, the police topped the list on both perception of corruption and actual experience with corruption.
Therefore, it is unwise to say that cinema shows the police in a bad light. Our movies represent the society; not so much the other way round. People have made their opinions about cops on the basis of their experiences with them; not what they saw in a movie.
The common man in India wants to keep himself away from the police, and it is ridiculous to blame film-makers for it. This is like saying brides are ill-treated in Indian households because of saas-bahu serials. Going by this trend, the Prime Minister may even suggest one day that politicians are being vilified by our movies 'despite the fact that they are apostles of virtues'.
It surprises me that Narendra Modi made no mention of the fact that politicians have deliberately deprived the police of a decent lifestyle and kept them underpaid in order to ensure they can buy their loyalty by throwing a few coins at them. In the words of a senior police officer on Aamir Khan's TV show, Satyamev Jayate , the police are nothing but 'shikari kutta' (hunting dogs) of politicians. The PM did not touch upon the fact that politicians control the lives of policemen and interfere with their work.
Now, look at these figures: the number of policemen per 100,000 people in India in 2011 was 137. This compares to about 217 in Australia, 393 in Hong Kong, 370 in Malaysia, 195 in South Korea, 307 in the UK and 256 in USA. Clearly, our guys are overworked. They have no life. Manpower is a problem. It's unfortunate that the PM made no mention of this.
According to the Prime Minister, the police should be 'SMART'. "By 'SMART' policing, I mean S for strict but sensitive, M for modern and mobile, A for alert and accountable, R for reliable and responsive and T for techno-savvy and trained," Modi said. But he left out a few crucial things: reducing their workload, improving their work conditions, and allowing them professional freedom.
Too much to ask for, sir?
I am no expert on police matters, but I can say if the government is interested in reforming the force, they should get down to brass tacks. In my opinion, the process should begin with something as basic as a change in the colour of their uniform, which over the years has instilled a sense of fear in the common man, forcing him to lose faith in a policeman's ability to be fair and just.
Nevertheless, it's heartening to see that the Prime Minister has spoken so openly about improving a key pillar of our democracy. It should start soon. Else, two things may happen: first, the movies portraying the police in a negative light will give more credence to the theory that most of our cops are wicked; and second, actor Jack Nicholson will have more Indian followers, because he once said: "There're only two people in your life you should lie to... your girlfriend and the police."

De-politicizing our public spacesDe-politicizing our public spaces
Nikhil Inamdar |  Dec 01, 2014 12:22 PM IST
Vociferous protests erupted in the Rajya Sabha last week over the rechristening of Hyderabad domestic airport. The Congress party disrupted the house to oppose a section of the airport being renamed as N.T. Rama Rao Domestic Terminal, accusing the ruling party in Andhra Pradesh of seeking political mileage with the name change. It is comical that the Congress, which has over the decades, baptized every important public building in this country after the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, should have a problem with the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) seeking to do the same. 
 
The grand old party, by thrusting the names of Nehru, Indira and Rajiv ubiquitously, has carefully and concertedly appropriated every sphere of India’s public life in the last 30 odd years. It has named a sum total of 450 different infrastructure projects, social welfare programs, educational institutions, trophies, sports stadiums, national sanctuaries, hospitals and boulevards after 3-4 members of the Nehru-Gandhi clan. The blatant obsequiousness in the party has translated to even Himalayan peaks, minor roller skating competitions and boat races being hijacked by the Gandhi surname according to this report . 
 
With the BJP’s emphatic victory in the 2014 general elections, an endeavor to alter the political iconography of the country is palpable, whether in renaming social schemes after Hindutva icons, averring legacies of freedom fighters like Sardar Patel or Deen Dayal Upadhyaya or seeking to have railway stations and airports named after Sangh leaders like Dr S P Mookerjee. This course correction is only expected to gather steam going forward as the government of the day seeks to legitimize its own symbolisms and religious-historic narratives through public representation of their ilk. And to many, it may seem justified too given how one sided the exercise have been till date. 
 
But can our government not be more munificent to achievers from other spheres? 
 
Leave aside the need for multiple non-partisan, politico-religious narratives to find room in a diverse, modern democracy such as India, why must every public structure or space be bequeathed to the legacy of either a politician or a freedom fighter? Don’t artists, musicians, scientists, sportspersons, actors and philosophers deserve equal symbolic representation in our public spaces? Has India’s glorious history and culture been wrought solely by nationalist leaders? Shouldn’t the legacies of poets, writers and mathematicians be commemorated and celebrated as emphatically? 
 
Public veneration of political martyrs and popular past leaders is not only an exercise in nation building, but also a tool used by political parties to shove their agendas and ideologies deep into the consciousness of the voter. While it is the prerogative entirely of the party in power to decide who public structures and schemes should be named after, ‘if the nomenclature…is not politically neutral, the sanctity of the democratic system would be in jeopardy’ notes Author and Columnist Dr. A. Surya Prakash in one of his old columns, asking the Election Commission to keep a vigil on such practices. 
 
This trend alas, is not restricted to India. Military and political leaders across the globe indulge in usurping public spaces to peddle their own figureheads. India must take inspiration from the few aberrations around. Airports in Liverpool and Rome for instance are named after John Lennon and Leonardo Da Vinci respectively. Norway’s new currency notes and passports adorn a slick, elegant look showcasing not political icons, but the country’s exquisite natural beauty. 
 
About time we too de-politicize our public spaces! There is much more that defines the fabric and splendor of this country than the mugs and forenames of its political leaders. 

Jewellery stocks shine  gain up to 20% on RBI moveJewellery stocks shine, gain up to 20% on RBI move
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: December 1, 2014  | 17:13 IST
Jewellery stocks on Monday rose sharply by up to 20 per cent on easing of gold import restrictions by the Reserve Bank.
Shares of Shree Ganesh Jewellery House soared 20 per cent, while Gitanjali Gems surged 19.96 per cent and Tribhovandas Bhimji Zaveri zoomed 19.28 per cent on the BSE.
Among others, PC Jeweller jumped 2.78 per cent and Titan Company rallied 5.30 per cent.
Easing restrictions on gold imports , the Reserve Bank of India had on Friday scrapped the controversial 80:20 scheme, a move which the industry believes will bring down prices of the precious metal.
Under the 80:20 norm, put in place in August 2013 to curb high gold inflows that was widening the current account deficit, at least 20 per cent of the imported gold had to be mandatorily exported before bringing in new lots.
"It has been decided by the Government of India to withdraw the 20:80 scheme and restrictions placed on import of gold. Accordingly, all instructions issued about the scheme from time to time...stand withdrawn with immediate effect," the RBI had said in a notification on Friday.
Gold imports jumped 280 per cent to $4.17 billion in October, as per the latest trade data. The in-bound shipments touched 95 tonnes in September this year as against 12 tonnes a year ago.

Haryana teen girls who thrashed molesters to be honoured on R-DayArmy slams door on Rohtak molesters
Sat Singh , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, December 01, 2014

The army will not go ahead with the recruitment process of three men accused of molesting two Haryana sisters on a bus after a video of the women thrashing the alleged molesters sparked widespread outrage across the country, army sources said on Monday.

Defence minister Manohar Parrikar made it clear a strong message should be sent that there was no place for such men in the army while the Haryana chief minister said the women would be honoured for their “act of bravery” on Republic Day as public support for the sisters grew on social media.
"We (the army) take such issues very seriously and we have a zero-tolerance policy. Two of the youths had cleared physical and medical tests in one of the rallies held in Haryana recently but they would not be allowed to take part in further process which is a written test," sources said.
Aarti Kuhar, 22, and her sister, Pooja, 19, were travelling in a Haryana Roadways bus on Friday on their way to Government College for Women in Rohtak district, when the three men allegedly molested them. The women protested at first and then hit back with their hands, legs and even a belt, while other passengers watched silently.
A pregnant woman, sitting next to the sisters, captured the incident on her mobile phone camera and shared it on WhatsApp. The video went viral in no time.
Watch: Haryana sisters thrash molesters in bus, mute passengers look on
“Go brave girls! #girlrising and wake up bystanders! Its shameful, the only one who intervened was a pregnant woman!” tweeted Freida Pinto, star of Academy-award winning film Slumdog Millionaire.
Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar announced a cash reward of Rs. 31,000 rupees each for the sisters, saying he hoped the publicity would sensitise others to the issue. “The kind of work that has been done by these two girls is praiseworthy,” he said.
A local court sent the three men to jail on Monday while the government suspended the bus driver and conductor for failing to protect the women.
The sisters, who stay with their parents in Thanakhurd village in Sonepat district, said the three men threw pieces of paper with their phone numbers at the women who did not respond. Angry at being rebuffed, the men asked them to vacate their seats.
“They said girls were meant to sit on bus bonnets and if we did not leave the seat for them, they would throw us out,” said Pooja.
Aarti said the conversation became heated but it was not until one of the men molested her that she hit them. “A pregnant lady tried to raise her voice, but the men were unmoved and continued groping us with their hands,” she added.
The incident  has once again highlighted the issue of women’s safety after the December 2012 brutal gang-rape of a young girl in Delhi that sparked nationwide protests. Haryana has also been in the news because of its skewed sex ratio and khap panchayats that routinely issue diktats against women.

Oct infra output growth accelerates to 6.3%  | LPG rate cut by Rs 113cement
(The infrastructure sector,…)
NEW DELHI: If last week ended in a black Friday after second-quarter growth slowed, data released a day ahead of the monetary policy suggested just the opposite — a super Monday. Core sector growth rebounded to a fourmonth high in October, the purchasing managers' index for November rose to a 21-month high and India's biggest car manufacturer reported that sales shot up last month, suggesting that the industrial sector is looking up again after a disappointing July-September quarter that dragged down overall economic growth.
Better numbers will ease some of the pressure — which intensified following the Friday GDP data — on Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan to cut rates in Tuesday's monetary policy announcement to stimulate the economy after the unexpectedly sharp fall in the inflation rate in recent months.
The core sector index, a gauge of the output of eight infrastructure industries, rose 6.3%, data released by the commerce department showed. The HSBC Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for November rose to 53.3 against a reading of 51.6 in the previous month, marking a 13th straight month of expansion.
Maruti Suzuki, India's biggest car manufacturer, notched up a 19.5% rise in total sales in November. Several of its rivals also reported a rise in sales, likely reversing a two-month slump in the market, rounding off a day of positive news for the government. Data released on Friday showed GDP rose 5.3% in the July-September quarter, below the nine-quarter high of 5.7% in the April-June quarter, making recovery prospects uncertain.
But the latest numbers suggest a pick-up in industrial activity after the sluggish second quarter.
The core sector has a 38% weight in the index of industrial production (IIP), suggesting a revival in growth in October from 2.5% in the previous month. To be sure, the base effect — 0.1% contraction in October last year — has magnified the growth.
"These are very encouraging signs. The second half will be somewhat better than the first half. The PMI showed that the export orders were fairly strong, suggesting the very bad patch in exports in second quarter could be behind us. I will be revising the growth forecast for the second half from 5.5% to 5.8%, which will take full-year growth to 5.6-5.7%," said Abheek Barua, consultant, Icrier, although he cautioned that "we are not looking at a dramatic recovery yet".
Strong car sales in November after the moderate contraction in October as well as the PMI numbers showed consumer demand is looking up. "If we take cues from core sector data and PMI, industry will look slightly better in October compared with the previous month. But we need to wait and see if there is a trajectory emerging. Nevertheless, our forecast said the industry will grow faster in the second half — today's (Monday's) data confirms that," said DK Joshi, chief economist, Crisil.
 
The rise in PMI was due to strong output on the back of robust orders. "Manufacturing activity accelerated further in November led by higher output and new orders. Domestic orders saw the biggest increase, even as new export orders continued to be strong," said Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC.
Core sector revival came on the back of a 16.2% rise in coal output, which is contrary to expectations that this would suffer after the Supreme Court cancelled mine allotments. Electricity production was up 13.2%.However, a 1% contraction in cement output and a modest 2.3% rise in steel production indicated sluggish construction activity. The immediate beneficiary of the strong numbers will be the central bank, since the clamour to cut rates may abate.
"Though there is a strong case for RBI to lower rates, we do not expect a cut in the policy meet tomorrow (Tuesday). It will like to wait some more," said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, CARE Ratings.
The PMI data also provides a reason for RBI to watch inflation for a bit longer before easing rates.
It showed that improving demand drove output prices higher in November and inflationary pressures intensified following three consecutive months of easing.
"Higher output and an uptick in final prices should convince RBI to stay on hold in the upcoming meeting," said Bhandari.
Consumer inflation for October eased to a series low of 5.52% while wholesale inflation fell to a five-year low of 1.77% in the same month and is expected to ease further because of rapidly falling fuel and commodity prices.
Hopes for a surprise cut haven't quite gone away though. "Given the OPEC decision last week and the INR outperformance, one cannot rule out an outside chance of a surprise in RBI policy tomorrow," Citi economist Rohini Malkani said in a note on Monday.

Sensex Falls 134 Points Ahead of RBI Review; ONGC, RIL Slump Over 3%
Reuters | Updated On: December 01, 2014 16:48 (IST)
Oil Slumps Near $59 for First Time Since 2009 on Oversupply
Mumbai: The Nifty retreated from a record high on Monday as blue chips fell on risk aversion in global markets after gold and oil tumbled, while caution also prevailed a day ahead of the Reserve Bank of India's policy review.
Plunging prices for commodities, hit by slowing factory activity in China and Europe, raised fears of deflation and hammered emerging market stocks and commodity-linked currencies.
Investors await the apex bank's policy review on Tuesday with markets already pricing in a rate cut amid a slump in crude oil prices, although only 4 out of 45 economists in a Reuters poll said the RBI will cut rates.
"It will be mistake if RBI doesn't cut rates on Tuesday. You can't sit in an island of inflation amid a crude oil slump and world worrying about low growth," said G Chokkalingam, founder of Equinomics, a research and fund advisory firm.
The 50-shares Nifty closed down 0.38 per cent at 8,555.90, after earlier hitting a record high of 8,623.
The benchmark BSE Sensex ended 0.47 per cent lower at 28,559.62, snapping its three-day gaining streak.
India's outperformance in 2014 and the over-exposure of emerging market funds are also prompting investors to lock in profits.
Credit Suisse trimmed India overweight to 10 per cent from 15 per cent versus emerging market benchmarks.
Oil explorers led the falls after oil slid to five-year lows in its longest losing streak since 2008.
Reliance Industries fell 2.4 per cent, Oil and Natural Gas Corp ended down 3.9 per cent and Cairn India lost 1.5 per cent.
Select lenders also fell. Housing Development Finance Corp fell 2 per cent while State Bank of India lost 0.6 per cent.
Larsen & Toubro fell 1.1 per cent on worries lower crude prices may lead to lower investment and order flows from the Middle East.
Mahindra & Mahindra lost 2.2 per cent after its November vehicle sales fell 13 per cent on year.
Among gainers, crude oil users rose on hopes of higher operating margins and increased discretionary spend in the economy.
Jet Airways gained 7.9 per cent, Apollo Tyres rose 2 per cent while Hindustan Petroleum Corp was up 1.2 per cent.
Berger Paints surged 12 per cent while Asian Paints advanced 7 per cent.
Jewellery firms also surged after India scrapped a rule that mandated trading companies to export 20 per cent of the gold imported.
Titan Company gained 5.2 per cent, Tribhovandas Bhimji Zaveri jumped 19.1 per cent and Gitanjali Gems surged 19.9 per cent, while PC Jewellers ended up 2.5 per cent.
($1 = 62.0100 rupees)

Rupee Ends Flat at 62.02Mumbai: The rupee ended largely steady on Monday after touching a near 9-1/2 month low, as dollar selling by exporters helped offset the weakness seen due to lower Asian currencies and global growth concerns.
Sentiment also remained cautious ahead of the Reserve Bank of India monetary policy review on Tuesday.
All emerging Asian currencies hit new lows on a day when Moody's downgraded Japan's sovereign credit rating stating "heightened uncertainty over the achievability of fiscal deficit reduction goals".
Meanwhile, the dollar continued to be boosted by oil's longest losing streak since the 2008 financial crisis. On Monday, oil prices extended from last week their steep sell-off after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) decided not to cut production, keeping markets well supplied.
"Asian units are reacting to the commodity deflation feeding into the strong dollar trend, apart from the fact that global growth is going down the tube," said Anindya Banerjee, a currency analyst at Kotak Securities in Mumbai.
Traders are now bracing up for the apex bank's policy review amid rising expectation of a cut in policy rates despite most analysts in a Reuters poll expecting the central bank to maintain status quo.
The partially convertible rupee closed at 62.02/03 per dollar versus 62.0250/0350 on Friday. It hit a low of 62.25 intraday - its weakest since February 20.
Traders said dollar sales by exporters and custodian banks helped the rupee recover from session lows.
In the offshore non-deliverable forwards market, the one-month contract was at 62.36, while the three-month was at 62.87.

In defense of collegeBy Vivek Wadhwa December 1 Follow @wadhwa
Long live college. (Charlie Neibergall/AP)
In a Washington Post  opinion piece , billionaire Peter Thiel asserts that college is the final stage of a competitive tournament in which kids at the top enjoy prestige because they’ve defeated everybody else. He claims that college education is a bubble and doesn’t provide more value than an insurance policy; that the college admissions process is all that is important because it anoints an “already-proven hypercompetitive elite.”
Thiel is mistaken on all fronts.
If indeed the value came from the college admissions filter, employers would simply replicate this by requiring applicants to supply the same material required by admissions offices: SAT scores and high-school records. They would hire former college admissions officers to assist in hiring, or recruit freshmen who have been admitted to a selective col­lege. After all, that is what pro­fessional sports leagues do: hire play­ers as soon as league rules allow. Why wait for them to graduate if college education is just a waste of time and money?
In a paper titled  Are Our Colleges and Universities Failing us , Stanford’s Provost, John Etchemendy, postulated that if employers were primarily using college as a signal of general intel­ligence, as well perhaps as the ambition to apply and get into a selective college, we would see much more hiring behavior like that of professional sports leagues. We would surely not see a premium for college education unless it provided real value.
The facts are that college graduates earn more than those who do not go to college and that the gap is increasing.  A study by Daron Acemoglu and David Autor found that the earnings of the average college graduate in 2008 exceeded those of the average high-school graduate by 97 percent.  Another study , by Carnevale, Rose and Cheah, estimated that the projected median lifetime earnings of those with a bachelor’s degree are 74 percent higher than the earnings of those with just a high-school diploma, and that there was a premium on tertiary education in almost every line of work, even those that do not require a college degree. For example, food-service managers and retail salespersons — occupations open even to those with no high-school diploma — benefit from a college education: in these roles, workers with a bachelor’s degree earn between 50 and 65 percent more than those with only a high-school diploma.
It isn’t that employers are being delusional in paying higher wages to workers with a higher education, Etchemendy explains. They are rewarding traits and skills that are acquired or honed during college, as well as intangibles such as general intelligence and persistence.
Four years ago, Thiel launched a fellowship to pay students $100,000 each to drop out of college. He claimed that, enabled to bypass college, gifted students would create “breakthrough technologies that will take civilization to the next level.” The Thiel Foundation has, to date, failed to produce even a single world-changing company, despite having funded nearly one hundred exceptional students who came up with their ideas while they were still in college — as did Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, and Bill Gates, the most famous dropouts of all. It is telling that an early-stage fund that Thiel later launched, Breakout Labs,  invests in start-ups mostly led by teams of academics, including PhDs and research scientists — not by college dropouts.
College teaches basic skills such as management, finance, and communications. It also teaches students how to interact and work with others, make compromises, deal with rejection and failure, and learn. It inculcates ethics and social values. That is why Jobs, Zuckerberg and Gates extolled the virtues of higher education and encouraged children to finish college — and why their companies rarely hire college dropouts. As well, entrepreneurship is hard enough for people with experience, maturity, and connections. For the vast majority of young people, gambling their future on a high-risk entrepreneurial venture is ill-advised, because they will not have developed the basic skills and values necessary to success.
Thiel and others have raised the alarm about the growing student-debt burden. They play on stories of students borrowing more than $100,000 to fi­nance their bachelor’s degree. These are true stories, but the examples are rare.  In fact, in 2007–08, the median debt nation wide of graduating seniors at non-profit colleges and universities was roughly $10,000, and 36 percent graduated with no debt at all. At one of the most expensive universities in the country, Stanford, students graduated with less than $5,000 average debt, and 77 percent of the Class of 2013 graduated debt-free.  Of the 23 percent who graduated with some debt, the median amount of debt was $13,000.
“If indeed investment in college is a bubble, it is the longest-lived bubble in economic history,” said Etchemendy in an e-mail to me.  “College graduates have earned more than high-school graduates as long as comparative wage data has been available, and for the most part it has steadily widened as technology has become a more essential part of the workplace. And this is no accident, technology increases economic productivity, but its invention, operation, and maintenance requires high-level skills obtained through education,” he added.
The reality is that we are no longer preparing our children to work in factories; we are readying them for today’s knowledge-based economy. This requires mastery of a wide assortment of technical skills, ability to work in groups, and continual learning. With accelerating technology advances, careers no longer last a lifetime. Entire industries will be decimated and new ones created within years—not the centuries it took in previous generations. Constant reinvention is required, for which higher education provides the foundation.
There surely is a competitive tournament, but it takes place on a global scale: whichever country has the most highly educated workforce benefits. How much so? The Milken Institute  documented that for each additional year of college education that the average worker in a region receives, the per-capita GDP of the region increases by a remarkable 17.4 percent and the region’s average worker’s wages are boosted by 17.8 percent. To put it starkly: Thiel’s prescriptions are a race to the bottom of the global economic ladder.

The presidents we rememberand the ones weve almost entirely forgottenBy Roberto A. Ferdman December 1 Follow @robferdman
I'm sorry, Lyndon B. Who? (Charles Tasnadi/AP Photo)
You can be the most important person in the free world one day, and almost entirely forgotten only decades later.
A number of United States presidents have, in fact, already fallen victim to that fate, according to a new study, which measured forgetfulness over a more than 40-year period. And many others are merely inching their way to a similarly unremembered state.
The study used four surveys conducted at Washington University at St. Louis—one in 1974, another in 1991, another in 2009, and another in 2014—each of which asked students to write down the names of as many presidents as they could and organize them in chronological order. The researchers then ranked the presidents that were most and least remembered by students in each survey to see if a trend emerged.
What they found was a pretty clear pattern. Nearly everyone in each of the four surveys was able to identify the first few presidents—George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison, specifically—as well as the most recent handful—so, for those asked in 2009, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George H.W. Bush. A healthy portion of people also remembered presidents whose reign coincided with significant events, like the Civil War—cue Abraham Lincoln. But by and large, the ability to name presidents faded over time, and often to a point of near non-remembrance.
This is what it looked like when they plotted the percentage of each generation—Baby Boomer, Generation X, and Millenials—that was able to identify each of the 44 presidents (without placing them in order).
This is what it looked like when the students had to not only name but also list the presidents in order (notice the near-immaculate U-shape):
"Memory for the order of presidents who served in office during the individual’s lifetime (or a few years before) declines linearly," the researchers note. They also point out that the way in which we remember presidents independent of the order in which they served is similar to way in which we remember a lot of other things.
Whether it be cards, numbers, or presidents, we tend to remember the first few things in a sequence, the last few, and a few stand outs in between. Otherwise, we're pretty good about forgetting everything else, and all the more as time goes by. The reason being that we tend to hold onto knowledge seen as useful, and discard knowledge seen as not. The less society talks about, reads about, or hears about a president, the less it remembers him.
"By the year 2060, Americans will probably remember as much about the 39th and 40th presidents, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, as they now remember about our 13th president, Millard Fillmore," Henry L. Roediger III, one of the study's authors, said in a statement .
By the study's estimates, fewer than half of Americans will remember Richard Nixon, and less than a quarter of the country will remember Dwight Eisenhower, Harry S. Truman, Lyndon B. Johnson, Gerald Ford by 2100.
It remains to be seen whether history will be so unkind to America's current president. Obama is, after all, the first African American president in the country's history, an unquestionably important and arguably unforgettable marker of not only his legacy, but the United States'. But many of his crowning achievements, including "Obamacare," aren't known to voters as a creation of the president. "Obamacare," for instance, isn't actually called "Obamacare"—it's called the Affordable Care Act. And in the states, it often goes by names that have no relation to the law.

Elite colleges accept 4 in 5 top applicantsBy Max Ehrenfreund December 1 Follow @MaxEhrenfreund
Princeton's official acceptance rate was 7.4 percent for the class of 2018. (AP/Mel Evans)
It isn't just high school seniors who try to make themselves look good in college admissions. So do the schools, and they waste everyone's time and money in the process.
Comparing the number of people who apply to the number who are accepted is the most obvious way to measure how selective a college is. As a result, colleges have been doing everything they can to make themselves seem more popular by encouraging even unqualified applicants to apply. "The marketing is unbelievable, just unbelievable," one counselor said . "There are places like Tulane that will send everyone a 'V.I.P.' application."
The results are artificially depressed acceptance rates, and an increasingly frenzied admissions process. Data suggest that controlling for students' standardized test scores, qualified applicants can still expect to get into elite schools, as Kevin Carey reports for The New York Times. Eighty percent of well-qualified applicants are accepted into at least one elite school -- they just have to send out more applications to be sure of receiving an acceptance letter somewhere.  According to one survey, the number of high school students applying to at least seven colleges has more than tripled  since 1990, to 29 percent.
This shell game in college admissions is just one example of a much larger problem: There's no handy way of ranking schools. In order to maintain their place on lists like that of U.S. News and World Report, colleges do all kinds of things that are at best a distraction from teaching. Sometimes, these shenanigans are costly. Witness George Washington University's monumental spending on new dormitories and recreational facilities for students, which transformed the campus from an affordable commuter school that could serve working people to an exclusive and expensive but highly ranked university.
An obvious solution would be to develop a thoughtful, comprehensive system for ranking schools based on data. Then schools wouldn't gain anything by deflating their acceptance rates. The rankings might depend on whether schools make an effort to include first-generation college students from poor families or whether their graduates default on their debt, for example. And the Obama administration has proposed to do exactly that.
University officials nationwide have reacted angrily to the proposal. They worry that a federal system would force colleges to focus on the wrong things. That's a real concern, but it would be a more persuasive objection if high school seniors weren't busily sending in applications by the dozen.

Number of the day: $380.95. That's how much the average holiday shopper spent over the four days since Thanksgiving, including online purchases. Total sales for the period declined 11 percent sine last year, flummoxing analysts who are still predicting a strong season for the retail sector. Maybe the figures reflect underlying weakness in the U.S. economy, or maybe people are just tired of Black Friday. Hiroko Tabuchi in The New York Times .
Chart of the day:
The major banks feel confident enough about a new agreement with federal regulators on who is liable when borrowers default that they're adopting less stringent standards for new mortgages Monday. In particular, some banks are expected to eliminate the additional points on a borrower's credit score many banks have required above federally mandated levels. Joe Light in The Wall Street Journal .
1. Top story: Obama to meet with cabinet, civil rights leaders on Ferguson
We may hear about police militarization from Obama soon. On the agenda at the White House Monday is a review into various federal programs that help local law enforcement agencies acquire military-style equipment. Julie Hirschfield Davis in The New York Times .
In Ferguson, things have quieted down. After seven days of protests, the community seems to be ready to move on. Meanwhile, Mayor James Knowles announced the creation of a civilian review board to handle complaints about police misconduct. David Montgomery and Wesley Lowery in The Washington Post .
Officer Darren Wilson has resigned from the police force. His mind had been made up some time ago, according to previous reports. In a letter, he said he hoped his resignation would "allow the community to heal." He will not receive severance pay or a pension, as he had served less than three years. Monica Davey, Mitch Smith and John Eligon in The New York Times .
BLOW: Whites misperceive the link between race and crime. Through the financial crisis, banks were pushing subprime loans on black borrowers, which in addition to decades of discriminatory lending is one more reason why so many blacks live in areas where crime is high.  The New York Times .
MICHAEL ERIC DYSON: Obama dodges the real issues in Ferguson. When the president preaches to black folks about obeying the law and acting like respectable members of society, he ignores the decades of lawbreaking by people like Martin Luther King that allowed Obama to attain his current office -- and no one listens to him anyway.  The New York Times .
COBB: More riots result in yet more governmental commissions. The explanations for the unrest in Ferguson are the same as they when the Kerner Commission convened in 1967, but Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon has decided the issue needs further study.  The New Yorker .
DOUTHAT: Neither party knows how to move the country beyond race. Both Republicans and Democrats have colorblind goals, but neither party can figure out how to achieve them. As a result, voters see Republicans as the party of whites and the Democrats as the party of everyone else.  The New York Times .
BRUENIG: Actually, riots can be economically efficient. If the rioters in Ferguson discourage just a few police officers around the country from using lethal force when it isn't necessary, the benefits of mayhem will have far outweighed the costs.  Gawker .
2. Top opinions: Inequality, Internet control, Ray Rice, tax extenders and the great white shark
LAURA TYSON: Inequality has an economic cost. "Growing income inequality and stagnant incomes for the majority of Americans mean weaker aggregate demand and slower growth. Even more important, income inequality constrains economic growth on the supply side through its adverse effects on educational opportunity and human-capital development." Project Syndicate .
CROVITZ: The Obama administration wants to give up control over the Internet. Since its inception way back in the Clinton era, the World Wide Web has been supervised by the U.S. Commerce Department. The White House intends to give up that control, but the result could be that authoritarian states like China can censor their citizens' Internet usage more easily.  The Wall Street Journal . 
KAVITHA DAVIDSON: Ray Rice's suspension was arbitrary to begin with. He deserved to be punished promptly and severely, but the NFL preferred to look the other way at first after Rice viciously beat his wife in an elevator in Atlantic City. Now his tardy suspension has been vacated, and the league has proven itself incapable of disciplining its players.  Bloomberg . 
DIONNE: Obama was right to veto the tax extenders. "Some who claim to care passionately about deficit reduction abandon their inhibitions when corporate tax breaks are on the table." And more broadly, Obama will clarify the national debate between the parties as he pursues his agenda through vetoes and executive actions -- it will be clearer to the public who stands for what.  The Washington Post .
In defense of the great white shark. In Australia, most beachgoers have seen a shark on the beach sometime in the past year, a survey found. They know that sharks aren't dangerous to humans, and that great whites suffer undeservedly from a bad reputation. Julia Baird in The New York Times .
Disturbance in the Force interlude: The trailer for the next Star Wars film, "The Force Awakens," has been released. Filming for a new installment began after Disney purchased Lucasfilm in 2012, and the cast will include Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford as well as some newer faces. Dave Itzkoff in The New York Times .
The script: "There has been an awakening. Have you felt it? The Dark Side -- and the Light." Watch the trailer  here .
A lightsaber shown in the trailer is fitted with a crossguard. On a real lightsaber, a crossguard would probably just get in the swordsman's way, argues a practicing smith who specializes in making weapons. Andrea Peterson in The Washington Post .
 
3. Climate diplomats meet in Lima
After decades of failed negotiations, maybe now is the time. The announcement of the agreement between China and the United States two weeks ago is lifting spirits among the negotiators, but a deal might be too late to avoid dangerous climate change. Coral Davenport in The New York Times .
The clock is ticking. This meeting is the last one before a deal is supposed to be signed in Paris next year, but the obstacle is the same as it's always been: who is responsible for averting climate change? And there will be frustration in Lima, since developing countries feel that wealthy nations and major polluters need to do more immediately -- that is, this decade -- to prepare for global warming. John Vidal in the Guardian .
4. Government funding deadline nears
Congress must pass a spending bill by Dec. 11. Lawmakers are expected to present a budget on Dec. 8. Meanwhile, other items on the legislative agenda include pending presidential requests for money to deal with Ebola, the Islamic State and child migrants at the southern border. Andrew Taylor for the Associated Press .
Speaker Boehner aims to avert a shutdown. He has to persuade the G.O.P. rank and file, who are angry about Obama's executive action on deportations, to put off a major confrontation with the president. Boehner thinks Republicans would be blamed for a shutdown, but Democrats worry he won't be able to get his caucus to support a funding bill no matter what. Carl Hulse and Jeremy Peters in The New York Times .
5. In case you missed it
The House's Obamacare suit focuses on what are known as "cost-sharing reductions." They're like the tax subsidies, but instead, they're given to the insurers instead of the subscribers to help lower the cost of insurance for people who can't afford it. It looks as though Congress never appropriated the money for these reductions, but the Obama administration has been giving them out anyway. Robert Pear in The New York Times .
The White House wanted to give parents of "dreamers" a reprieve from deportation. Administration officials worried that doing so would exceed Obama's legal authority to act. Critics say the decision to exclude the parents was politically motivated. Juliet Eilperin and Jerry Markon in The Washington Post .
Gay men may soon be able to donate blood. An FDA advisory panel meets this week to consider revising the 31-year-old rule. One proposal would restrict donations to those gay men who have not had sex within the past year. Brady Dennis in The Washington Post .
Under new management, Corinthian Colleges will be not for profit. The schools relied heavily on federal student loans, but their graduates regularly defaulted on their debts, and they encouraged new students to commit fraud on federal applications for financial aid. Corinthian will reorganize as a not-for-profit enterprise -- but one that is owned by a debt-collection company that could potentially profit off overly leveraged graduates. Although the deal might appear to create a conflict of interest, it has the blessing of the Department of Education. Danielle Douglas-Gabriel in The Washington Post .
The feds get $29 million, and students get nothing. Yes, the new owners are technically not-for-profit, but the CEO made $1.1 million in 2010, and the employees receive annual bonuses worth hundreds of thousands. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has sued the firm for its aggressive treatment of bankrupt graduates, but Education gets a fat check as part of the deal.  The Wall Street Journal . 
NICK BUTLER: Expect the decline in energy prices to continue for a long, long time. Solar panels, fracking and other new technologies will not only increase the supply of energy, but also allow the world to use it more efficiently. Energy companies, meanwhile, have been planning on steadily increasing energy costs for years.  The Financial Times .

The first cricket Test between India and Australia will be held here from December 9 after the four-match series’ schedule was revised on Monday in the wake of young player Phillip Hughes’ tragic death which left the home team distraught.
“Revised Schedule: 1st Test (Dec 9-13), 2nd Test (Dec 17-21), 3rd Test (Dec 26-30) and 4th Test (Jan 6-10). Venues: 1st Test (Adelaide), 2nd Test (Brisbane), 3rd Test (Melbourne) and 4th Test (Sydney) #AUSvsIND,” the BCCI said on its official twitter handle.
Hughes’ funeral would be held in Macksville on Wednesday. The entire Australian team, Indian cricket captain Virat Kohli, visiting side’s coach Duncan Fletcher and Team Director Ravi Shastri will attend the funeral of the young batsman, who would have turned 26 yesterday.
The first Test was originally scheduled to start on December 4 in Brisbane, which has now become the venue for the second match.
The Adelaide Test was originally scheduled to start from December 12. The second Test in Brisbane will start on December 16, followed by Melbourne on December 26 and the final match in Sydney, starting January 6.
A two-day tour game featuring a CA XI was cancelled last week, but India might get an opportunity to play a practice match later this week.
The tourists were due to fly to Brisbane on Monday, but put off their travelling plans until the venue and dates for the first Test were confirmed.
“The Indian side will remain in Adelaide until details for the first Test have been confirmed,” CA had tweeted. Australian players were left in mourning after Hughes lost his life on being hit by a bouncer during a domestic game here last week.
Australian captain Michael Clarke, who described Hughes as his little brother, were among the players who broke down publicly and penned emotional tributes to the youngster.

National AIDS helpline gets over 4 000 calls on Day 1On Day 1, national AIDS helpline gets over 4,000 calls
Our Bureau
Round-the-clock service launched on World Aids Day (December 1)
Mumbai, Dec 1 :  
Over 4,000 calls have been made on the country’s first national AIDS helpline, 1097, launched on behalf of the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO).
The round-the-clock service was launched on World Aids Day (December 1) by Piramal Swasthya who have partnered with Population Services International (PSI).
Piramal Swasthya is part of Piramal Foundation and had been selected by PSI/NACO in a competitive bid.
One-stop solution
The funds from USAID were routed by PSI through NACO to consolidate the 1097 services present in different States and re-position it as a national service, an official familiar with the development told Business Line.
There have been over 4,000 calls till 6 pm, the official said, adding that the nature of the calls was still to be mapped.
More than 80 per cent of women and approximately 70 per cent of men in India do not have comprehensive knowledge about HIV/AIDS, a note from Piramal Swasthya said, and the 24X7 national AIDS helpline call centre would work as a one-stop solution for people across the country.
Callers would get information on AIDS, counselling services, information directory/referral service and grievance redressal (complaints & feedback escalation), the note said.
And significantly, it would be in eight languages at present — Hindi, English, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Marathi, Assamese and Bengali.
Reducing new infections
The service would be supported by a hub based in Hyderabad, staffed with 20 counsellors. At the call centre, incoming calls would be detected and re-routed to regional centres depending on the language chosen by the caller.
The counsellors span across nursing, paramedics, sociology, psychology and social work, among others.
They have counselling skills with requisite training from Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) in collaboration with NACO, the note said.
In fact, through this particuar model, the Government is aiming to achieve its goals for the fourth phase of NACP which is reducing new infections by 50 per cent and providing comprehensive care, support and treatment to all persons living with HIV/AIDS.
Balaji Utla, Head – Piramal Swasthya, pointed out that they had already run the 104 healthcare helpline in six Indian states and have reached out to 70 million people.
And hence, the 1097 partnership was natural progression.

In its 25th year, Tata Power Solar looks for break-even
M Ramesh
Shown improved performance in 2013-14
Chennai, Dec 1:  
Tata Power Solar, India’s oldest solar company, has completed 25 years of existence, the company announced today. The company, formerly known as Tata BP Solar, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Power Ltd, a part of the Tata group.
In a statement, the company has said that in its quarter century of existence it has “touched the lives of over 30 million people and reduced carbon footprint by more than 6.2 million tonnes.”
Tata Power Solar manufactures solar cells and modules (modules are made with cells), as well as a huge range of solar-power based products such as water heaters and lamps. The company’s two plants in Bengaluru can produce 180 MW of cells and 200 MW of modules. Its Chief Executive Officer, Ajay Goel, recently told Business Line that the company would invest in upgrading its manufacturing lines as the market picks up.
In addition to manufacturing, it also builds solar power plants for others.
In June 2012, after the Tatas bought over BP (British Petroleum) 51 per cent stake in the joint venture, Tata BP Solar became Tata Power Solar.
Still loss making
In 2013-14, Tata Power Solar achieved a turnover of Rs 1,103 crore and made a net loss of Rs 126.77 crore, compared with a turnover Rs 595 crore and a net loss of Rs 82.72 crore in the previous financial year respectively, but the dip in the net loss was mainly on account of an exceptional gain (reversal of provisions no longer needed) and deferred tax assets in 2012-13, which were not available last year. The company’s performance improved in 2013-14—it turned in an operating profit of Rs 16.33 crore, compared with an operating loss of Rs 42 crore in the previous year.
Ajay Goel recently said that he expects the company’s fortunes to be on the upswing in tandem with the mood in the solar manufacturing industry, which was swung from despondency last year to making plans for investments now.

A season of highs and lows for PV SindhuA season of highs and lows for PV Sindhu
Dhruv Munjal | New Delhi Dec 01, 2014 04:44 PM IST
At the Tap Seac Multi-sports Pavilion in Macau on Sunday, dressed in fulgent yellow and blue, P V Sindhu did what she does best. The lanky 19-year-old girl from Hyderabad was at her precocious best, pulverizing her opponent with a brand of badminton that has made her one of the most promising young talents in the world. A brand of tenacious, unrelenting badminton.
 
On match point against world no.91 Kim Hyo Min in the final of the Macau Grand Prix, Sindhu unleashed a series of smashes at her Korean opponent’s body, forcing her to send one wide and handing Sindhu her first title of the season. At the end of their 45-minute battle, Sindhu let out a mild scream before embracing her coaches at court side. The emotion was one of relief rather than elation. 
 
It has been that kind of season for Sindhu. Despite winning medals at the Commonwealth Games and the Asian Games, and also becoming the first Indian woman to win back-to-back medals at the World Championships this year, 2014 has been a relatively unfulfilling season for Sindhu. The triumph in Macau is a fitting way to end the season, but the world no.11 would be disappointed with winning just the one title in a year that promised so much. 
 
On Sunday, Sindhu outplayed her opponent with a clinical mix of aggressive hitting and deft touches. Kim often found herself wiggling on the floor, desperately trying to cut out Sindhu’s disguised drop shots – a tactic generally employed by Sindhu’s opponents because of her long frame. In a field devoid of the top four women players in the world – Li Xuerui, Wang Shixian, Wang Yihan and compatriot Saina Nehwal – Sindhu was always the favourite to defend her title in Macau. The win may not have a massive bearing on the world rankings or stand out as one of her best, but it's a title win nonetheless. Sindhu will likely head into next season brimming with confidence. 
 
Sindhu’s major scalps this year both came at the World Championships in Copenhagen. She took out the then world no. 5 Bae Yeon Ju in the pre quarter-final, before assuring herself of a bronze medal by beating world no. 2 Wang Shixian in a marathon encounter in the quarter-final. While she does possess the game to upset the top guns, Sindhu’s consistency has been the major let down. When on song, Sindhu can dictate a game with ferocious attacking shots combined with subtle change-ups. But she is also often erratic with her stroke-play, giving up ground from comfortable winning positions. For a 19-year old, she has made massive strides in the sport. But at the end of the day, she’s still only 19. Hopefully, we will see the best of P V Sindhu in 2015.
 

Police arrest constable for abetting suicide ofcolleagueBy: Express News Service | Vadodara |
Posted: December 1, 2014 8:26 pm | Updated: December 1, 2014 8:58 pm
Almost five days after an FIR was registered in the mysterious death of a lady  constable in Rajpipla, the Local Crime Branch of the Narmada Police arrested constable Vijaysinh Deepsinh from the outskirts of Ahmedabad city. According to the police, Vijaysinh had been evading arrest ever since an FIR was lodged against him for the abetment of suicide of lady constable Vasanti Vasava.
On Monday evening, shortly after 4 pm, the Local Crime Branch of the Narmada Police arrested Vijaysinh from the outskirts of Ahmedabad, five days after an FIR was lodged against him by Vasanti’s family, for sexual harassment and intimidation. Narmada police said that Vijaysinh had been on a leave since over two weeks to prepare for a competitive exam to become a Police Sub-Inspector, after which, he was evading the imminent arrest.
Vijaysinh’s wife, who has also been named in the FIR, had applied for anticipatory bail in the local court in Narmada, which was rejected on Monday. Although the police have not yet arrested Vijaysinh’s wife, Narmada Superintendent of Police Jaipalsinh Rathod said that they would take a call on her arrest after the probe.
According to Rathod, Vasanti and Vijaysinh had been involved in a relationship “without a future”, leading to her breakdown and eventual suicide. Rathod said, “The primary cause of Vasanti’s death is due to hanging. It is a simple case of suicide. There is no murder. We have found out that the two were involved in a relationship.
Since Vijaysinh is a married man with two children, the relationship between Vasanti and him had no future. She had developed an emotional attachment for him and this could have driven her to suicide. We are analyzing the detailed call records of both Vasanti and Vijaysinh to establish this. We have booked him for abetment of suicide in the FIR and not for murder.”
Vasanti’s family has rubbished Rathod’s statement about a “love affair” and maintained that Vijaysinh has murdered Vasanti as she had refused to allow him to sexually exploit her, blaming the police for “covering up” the murder. On Monday, Vasanti’s brother Raghuvir expressed disappointment that the police were trying to “tarnish the image” of his departed sister.
Raghuvir said, “Now that she is gone, they will say that she had an affair with Vijaysinh and killed herself in frustration. It is a blatant lie. My sister had told me about Vijaysinh’s indecent advances on a number of occasions.
“She had no affair with him. Even when her body was found, the police took my naive, illiterate father to sign the case papers calling it a suicide, without showing me the so called suicide note, although I was present there.”
Raghuvir has alleged that the senior officers were trying to shield Vijaysinh as he was the “secret keeper” of the officers and was in-line to be promoted to a PSI. Rathod, however, dismissed the family’s allegation about a cover up and said,  “For the last three days, we were searching for him. We sent our teams to the outskirts of continued…

West Bengal government to convert Kalyani jail into a detention centre of BangladeshimmigrantsWritten by Sabyasachi Bandopadhyay | Kolkata |
Posted: December 1, 2014 8:12 pm
The West Bengal Government has finally decided to convert the Kalyani Sub-jail in Nadia district into a detention centre of Bangladesh immigrants who overstayed their prison terms and are languishing in various jails of the state. Home secretary Basudeb Banerjee has written a letter to heads of several depatrments on December 10 requesting them to expedite the matter.
In fact it was following a Supreme Court order in the first week of September that the Centre asked all states to build such detention centres to house Bangladeshi prisoners. By doing this the state government is in fact following the path of states like Punjab which too were going to build detention centres for foreign nationals inside jails.
Earlier the state government was planning to build such a centre at Bongaon, the town in North 24 Parganas district thst borders Bangladesh. But it seems that the state government has taken this initiative because of pressure from the Centre. At present in West Bengal jails out of around 3000 Bangladeshi prisoners, around 600 are ‘Jaan-khalash’ (overstayed their terms) prisoners.
In fact by earmarking a separate jail for Bangladeshi jaan-khalash prisoners the state government is implementing a central government plan that was mooted by the Ministry of Home Affairs during the NDA regime when L. K. Advani was deputy prime minister and home minister.
However the decision to convert the Kalyani sub-jail into a detention centre has triggered much consternation among jail officials who are already burdened with overcrowded jails. “We have received the order. Earlier we heard a separate detention centre will be built at Kalyani. But now we have got this order from the Home depatrment. We don’t know what to do,” one official told Indian Express.
However Hyder Aziz Safi, minister for jails, who has been sidelined by chief minister Mamata Banerjee for his mishandling the affairs of the jail department that came to the fore following the suicide attempt of Trinamool Congress MP Kunal Ghosh, told Indian Express: “I don’t know anything. Let’s see what happens.”

The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways will soon come out with mandatory crash testing norms for passenger cars
NEW DELHI: The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways will soon come out with mandatory crash testing norms for passenger cars.
"The government is planning to mandate the offset frontal crash test and side impact crash test norms for passenger cars ," Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways Pon Radhakrishnan informed the Rajya Sabha today.
To meet these regulations, majority of car manufacturers will need to have several in-built safety devices, including air bags.
He said the facilities are being built for the requisite test under National Automotive Testing and Research and Development Infrastructure Project (NATRIP) initiative.
"Once these facilities are ready, the regulations will be implemented," Radhakrishnan said.
The Society of Indian Automobile Manufactures (SIAM) is a member of the Standing Committee on the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, which decides the implementation issues.
Automobile manufacturers provide their viewpoints from time to time in this forum along with other stakeholders.

Is excluding a student activist from a university job based on his political activity a crime in MinnesotaBy Eugene Volokh December 1 Follow @volokhc
The University of Minnesota collects mandatory “student services fees,” which it then distributes to support various student group events and projects. A Student Services Fee Committee decides which groups get funds, and is supposed to do that on a viewpoint-neutral basis (see Board of Regents v. Southworth (2000) ). As best I can tell (mostly from the official application for committee membership ), prospective student members are chosen in the first instance by university staff, but then the undergraduate student government and the graduate student government are entitled to remove several prospective members, and thus prevent them from being hired. Members who are chosen are paid $750 to $1000 for 60 to 80 hours of work.
But there’s now a controversy: pro-Israel student activist Ilan Sinelnikov is apparently being removed by the graduate student government because of his activism (though the decision is apparently not yet final). According to The Algemeiner ,
“I got accepted to the job, I got hired, in 4th place out of 21 other candidates,” for the role of financial administrator on the student services committee, [said Sinelnikov]…. The 22-year-old Rehovot native, and the others were then to then be voted on by the undergraduate Student Association, and then by the graduate body, to receive final approval….
Enter Damien Carriere, the student representative to the board, and a well-known BDS (Boycott, Divest, Sanction) campus activist.
“As soon as he heard that an Israeli — who established the Students Supporting Israel (SSI) group — got the position, he started a poisonous campaign against me,” Sinelnikov said….
“We’re talking about hundreds of emails; we’re talking about calling SSI a ‘hate group,’ and comparing us to the Ku Klux Klan, and even saying that my English was not good enough to serve on the committee,” Sinelnikov noted….
“[Ilan Sinelnikov] is a member of a hate group (SSI) and I think he comes in with a fishy agenda,” Carriere wrote in an email quoted on Wednesday in Campus Reform ….
According to the Campus Reform post,
Carriere explains in the emails that SSI is a hate group because the students belong “to a certain ideology which is present among some citizens of that state that has been refusing rights to minorities outside of the recognized borders of that country.”
In a follow-up email, Carriere said that he would label Christian Crusaders for Christ a hate group because it “is named after a bloody and inherently racist episode in European history.”
“The term crusade is considered by many as offensive because it refers to the will of chasing the Muslims from their land by mean [sic] of war,” Carriere wrote.
The official rejection e-mail sent to Sinelnikov apparently states,
I am writing to let you know that GAPSA [the graduate student government] voted, in a vote of 14-6 (with 11 abstentions), to remove you from the SSFC Slate. You were removed based on the rationale that you “have not demonstrated an ability to remain impartial.” Two handouts (screenshots from your Facebook page) were distributed to GAPSA membership – one with a quote of “Beggars can’t be choosers” over a story that posted October 22, and the other from September 1st with a quote of “Coexist Fail.”
Here are what appear to be the relevant screenshots:
Now this exclusion from a government job (however modestly paid) based on Sinelnikov’s speech might well violate the First Amendment (see Pickering v. Board of Ed. (1968)), which applies to decisions not to hire as well as decisions to fire, see (Elfbrandt v. Russell (1966), Keyishian v. Board of Regents (1967), and Rutan v. Republican Party (1990)). For more on the Pickering balancing test, see here .
But I wonder whether the more serious problem — if the facts are as the Algemeiner report suggest — might have to do with a Minnesota criminal statute, Minn. Stat. Ann. § 10A.36 (emphasis added):
An individual or association must not engage in economic reprisals or threaten loss of employment or physical coercion against an individual or association because of that individual’s or association’s political contributions or political activity. This subdivision does not apply to compensation for employment or loss of employment if the political affiliation or viewpoint of the employee is a bona fide occupational qualification of the employment. An individual or association that violates this section is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.
This is one of many statutes, present to some degree or another in about half the states, that protect even private employees from employer retaliation for political activity ; and it certainly applies to public employment (and seemingly to contracting decisions and not just employment). The potential danger to the graduate student government officials, if their decision leads to Sinelnikov’s, is this:
Removing someone from a list of people who would be hired for a job is an “economic reprisal[].”
Public advocacy of support for Israel seems like “political activity.” Indeed, Gay Law Students Assn. v. Pacific Tel. & Tel. Co. (Cal. Supreme Ct. 1979) , interpreted a similar California statute to cover the espousal “of a cause” (and not just a candidate or a party), including the cause of gay rights — the cause of preserving support for Israel and opposing attempts to divest from Israel and otherwise pressure or punish Israel would likewise be a “political activity.” And this tracks common terms such as “political speech,” which has generally been used in First Amendment law to refer to speech on public affairs matters, and not only speech related to elections.
On the other hand, the statute does appear in the statutory chapter dealing with election campaigns, and was enacted as part of a election reform act, so maybe “political” here was intended to just refer to election campaigns. Also, as I note on pp. 313-14 of this article , a couple of federal trial court decisions in South Carolina took a different view, limiting “the exercise of [constitutional] political rights and privileges” (the South Carolina statutory language) to matters more closely linked to elections.
Still, a Fourth Circuit appellate panel (later reversed on procedural grounds) disagreed with those district court decisions, reasoning that the display of a Confederate flag off the job would indeed be “political” enough to be covered by the statute. And even a statute appearing in an election reform package may be seen as covering “political activity” in the broad sense of the term, since debates about issues (such as support of Israel or the influence of Islam in America) are often highly relevant to political campaigns. When we vote on a candidate, our vote is influenced not just by what was said by or about the candidate, but also by our views on the issues that the candidate has acted on and spoken about. (Rightly or wrongly, this may be especially relevant in Minnesota, both because Rep. Keith Ellison from Minnesota is Muslim, and has unsurprisingly spoken on Islam-related issues , and because of Minnesota controversies involving Muslim Somali immigrants, such as the one referred to in one of Sinelnikov’s Facebook posts.)
The question then would be whether “political affiliation or viewpoint of the employee” is a “bona fide occupational qualification” for the job. In some situations, it surely would be — the Democratic Party, for instance, should surely be free to dismiss a spokesperson or a campaign strategist who had publicly supported the Republicans, and likewise for many other advocacy groups. But I doubt that this would be so here: the Student Services Committee is not supposed to be a political group, and indeed is supposed to distribute funds in a viewpoint-neutral way.Now perhaps one could argue that the statute should allow employers to enforce a no-politics qualification for a job, for instance when a newspaper insists that its reporters stay out of politics. (See Nelson v. McClatchy Newspapers, Inc. (Wash. 1997) , which held that a newspaper has a First Amendment right to impose such a policy, even in the face of a statute that categorically bans employer retaliation for employee activity related to election campaigns or parties.) The statute doesn’t seem to literally cover such situations where lack of political action is a bona fide occupational qualification, but one can imagine its being read this way.But I think this rationale would support an exclusion of Sinelnikov only if in fact there was a policy reflecting such an understanding of the “occupational qualification” for the job, whether the policy is written or a consistently enforced custom. Have politically active students indeed been consistently excluded from the Student Services Committee? If not, then I don’t think the “bona fide occupational qualification” language would justify any exclusion of Sinelnikov on the grounds of supposed lack of “impartial[ity]” “demonstrated” by his political activity.
I do not think that Damien Carriere or others who called for the removal of Sinelnikov from the appointment list could be criminally punished just for their advocacy, even if the removal of Sinelnikov from the list was a crime. Even advocacy of criminal conduct is usually constitutionally protected (see Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969)).
But, if I’m reading the Minnesota statute right, it may be a crime for student government officials to actually vote to exclude Sinelnikov. There, they aren’t speaking — they are exercising governmental power to engage in a (potentially illegal) “economic reprisal” against a person. And just as an administrative board and its members can be sued for discriminatory refusals to hire someone (though public advocates of such discrimination can’t be sued for their advocacy), so the members can be prosecuted, I think, for refusals to hire that are outlawed under state law. (For more on the lack of First Amendment protection for government officials’ legally operative votes, as opposed to their speech, see Nevada Comm’n on Ethics v. Carrigan (2011) ; and note that administrative officials lack many of the special immunities that state legislators possess.)
I’m not certain that laws such as this Minnesota statute are a good idea, especially when they apply to private employment and not just government employment, and especially when they impose criminal punishment. Nonetheless, rightly or wrongly, Minnesota does have such a law.
All this thinking is just tentative, because the facts of the Sinelnikov controversy aren’t entirely clear, the term “political activity” hasn’t been authoritatively interpreted by Minnesota courts, and the prospective defendants haven’t had a chance to articulate a possible theory of why “the political affiliation or viewpoint of the employee is a bona fide occupational qualification of the employment” in this instance. If you have some facts or legal authority that I’ve missed, I’d very much like to hear about it. But it seems at least plausible that, if the removal of Sinelnikov from the appointment list actually takes place, anyone who took the legally effective steps towards that removal based on Sinelnikov’s “political activity” might be seen as having violated the Minnesota statute.

How much discretion does the executive branch have over immigration policyBy Jonathan H. Adler December 1
The president’s decision to defer the risk of deportation for several million unauthorized immigrants has prompted substantial debate about the scope of the president’s authority. The president unquestionably has broad authority over immigration policy under current law.  As The New York Times reported , the administration sought to use this authority quite aggressively.
Following the announcement, the folks at Balkinization hosted a symposium on the scope of the president’s administrative discretion over immigration policy . Links to the collected posts, from a range of scholars — including Bruce Ackerman, Marty Lederman, Gillian Metzger, and Zach Price, among others — can be found here . For decidedly less sympathetic takes, see this Wall Street Journal op-ed critiquing the OLC memo on which the administration relied by David Rivkin and Elizabeth Price Foley and this NRO article by former George W. Bush administration attorneys Shannen Coffin and Michael Edney.
In the New Republic, Eric Posner argues that the administration has set a precedent for deregulatory action that Republicans should like (assuming there is a Republican president at some point in the near future).  He elaborates on the point and responds to critics here .  As a matter of political norms, he is probably correct.  As a matter of law, I am not so sure.  Immigration law, as it has been understood and implemented for the past several decades, affords the executive branch more discretion than it enjoys in many other areas. Further, Congress retains the ability to curtail this discretion through statutory reform or limitations on appropriations (not that Congress is likely to do either).
As I noted here , it’s not enough to look at the scope or scale of an exercise of executive authority to evaluate its legality.  The details matter.  Specifically, one must consider the nature and character of the executive action, the relevant statutory provisions, and the way these provisions have been construed and implemented over time. The result is that some broad and aggressive actions, such as the president’s immigration initiatives (both DACA and the more recently announced policy) may have sounder legal footing than deceptively narrow and discrete actions, such as delaying the employer mandate.
Law matters here, but so do political norms. Much of the debate over the president’s immigration action is really about the appropriate use of executive authority, and not about the law.  This action is unlikely to be challenged in court successfully. Not only are the merits tough, but it’s unlikely anyone has standing.  This means the debate will be resolved politically, as it should be.

Norways tree at Union Station to feature environmental message(Photo courtesy of the Royal Norwegian Embassy)
Ah, the holidays — they’re all about Christmas carols, mistletoe, and… global warming?
That’s according to the 32-foot Christmas tree at Union Station donated by Norway, which will be festooned with polar bear ornaments to remind holiday merrymakers of something a little more serious than visions of sugarplums.
Norwegian Ambassador Kåre Aas tells us the embassy selected the enviro theme after seeing the splash that last year’s tree featuring Edvard Munch’s “The Scream” made and realizing that the decor could serve as a platform for an important message. “We are seeing an increased emphasis on climate issues, and Norway is working closely with the U.S. on climate issues,” he said.
So the hundreds of reflective ornaments in the shape of polar bears will serve as a reminder that the adorable creatures’ frosty habitat is under threat. Cocoa, anyone?
The tree-lighting is set for Monday night, when Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) will flip the ceremonial switch.
Another way the tree is environmentally friendly? Shh… it’s actually faux and can be reused from year to year.

Legal recognition for gold jewellery hallmarks: PaswanLegal recognition for gold jewellery hallmarks: Paswan
Tomojit Basu
Tweet
New Delhi, Dec 1:  
The Bureau of Indian Standards Act (BIS Act, 1986) will enable hallmarking of precious metals and jewellery including gold by providing ‘legal recognition’ through amending the Act. On making the process mandatory, the Government will only take a call after further assessment of consumer needs by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs.
The BIS, which will now be positioned as National Standards Body of India, currently certifies gold quality of as low as 9 carat (K) and Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan doubted that jewellers were disclosing quality grades to consumers.
“Till today, I had only heard of 18K to 24K gold. But I was told here that grades are as low as 9K. We need consumers to easily understand what is being sold and such distinctions are not clear when someone visits a shop to buy gold,” he said at a meeting today of stakeholders on the amendment of the BIS Act.
“Through amending the Act, legal status is being given to gold hallmarking. It will remain a voluntary standard,” he added.
G. Gurucharan, Additional Secretary of the Department of Consumer Affairs, stated that there were two related concepts in the matter of setting standards for gold jewellery.
“One, there are tests for the purity of gold and the other is the hallmark that guarantees the quality assurance. BIS identifies hallmarking centres and gives recognition. All jewellery that is sold then is guaranteed of the quality. We will work out making it mandatory after further consultation,” he said.
Hallmarking of gold jewellery, which assures customers of the purity of gold, was introduced in 2000 whereby jewellers are required to get licences from the BIS and get goods hallmarked by one of 300 BIS-authorised centres. According to the standards authority, there are almost 13,000 licensed domestic jewellers. The sellers can be penalised through a fine or having their licenses revoked if they are found to be misusing the license.
“We’ve been talking about ‘Make In India’ and standards should be good enough for it to become a brand globally. There are three things – standards on which there should be no compromise, procedures which should be simplified and consumers should find it easy to understand,” said Paswan, adding that the amendments, which include expanding the number of products covered for mandatory standards from 102 to 2,300, would be brought before the Cabinet at the earliest.

Pfizer-Wyeth merger complete, catapults to top 10 in India 
Our Bureau
Tweet
Mumbai, December 1:  
Drugmaker Pfizer Limited has completed its merger with fellow-multinational Wyeth Limited, a little over a year after the boards of both companies okayed the merger.
The company has received approvals from the Bombay High Court and has filed with the Registrar of Companies to conclude the merger process, Pfizer said. The merger places Pfizer among the top 10 pharmaceutical companies in India by market share, it added.
With the conclusion of the process, all employees of Wyeth are also now a part of Pfizer Limited. The company has already completed the necessary steps to ensure a seamless transition and integration of the workforce into Pfizer, it added.
Last year, announcing that the merger process had entered its last mile, Pfizer and Wyeth’s India-head, Aijaz Tobaccowalla had said, there was a benefit in running a single company and having a single brand in terms of focus and attracting talent.
Pfizer has 2,500 employees and Wyeth 480, and the combined entity’s ranking gets bumped up within the top 10 in India, from the earlier positions of 18th and 28th, he had then said.
Majority stake
The United States based parent-company, Pfizer Inc, through its subsidiaries holds majority stake in both companies and will continue to remain the majority shareholder with an approximate 64 percent holding in Pfizer Limited, post-merger, the company said.  
Following the merger, Pfizer will be present in a “wider therapeutic universe”, it said, besides debuting in vaccines and marking a presence in women’s health.

Government committed to develope ports to boost infrastructure and trade: Maharashtra ChiefMinisterBy: Express News Service | Mumbai |
Posted: December 1, 2014 8:45 pm
The chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Monday gave the nod for the Rs. 775 crore railway line project which connects Jaigad Port with Konkan Railway through a public and private partnership to boost infrastructure and industries in Raigad district of Maharashtra.
The chief minister signed a memorandum of understanding with the Jaigad Port Company Private Limited and Konkan Railway for the 34 km railway tracks with the total cost of Rs 775.
Fadnavis said, “The port development will not only boost the trade but also go a long way in development of the infrastructure in the region. It would also provide new opportunities to the locals in employment.”
The state and centre are working in tandem to promote the developments of ports through PPP model in Maharashtra. At present the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) is already overloaded. The state government reckons there is a need to provide alternative to decongest the existing ports.
The project which is expected to complete in 24 months will boost the port activities and develop infrastructure in the Konkan region. The
chief minister said, “ The railway connectivity with the Jaigad Port will boost the import and export of goods which often is languishing
for months in absence of connectivity.” The stake holders in the project are Konkan Railways (26% equity), Maritime Board (11% ) and Jaigad Port Pvt Limited (63%).
Another multi-purposes project worth Rs 1000 crore Karanja Port Terminal in district Raigad was also launched on Monday. The project
which is also being promoted through public private partnership between Karanja Terminal and Logistic Pvt Limited and Maritime Board
is expected to complete in two years.

Southampton look to bounce back against Arsenal after Manchester CitylossBy: Reuters | London |
Posted: December 1, 2014 8:38 pm
A 3-0 reality check at the hands of Manchester City was always a moment waiting to happen for Southampton. Just how they bounce back from Sunday’s defeat may now determine their fortunes this season.
Clues to the answer could come as early as Wednesday with a trip to Arsenal in the Premier League.
“There is no time to be any more disappointed about one result,” Saints boss Ronald Koeman told reporters on Monday. “It was three points, and Wednesday is another one.
“It is the best way to have a good reaction. Train hard, work hard and show it on the pitch – we have the chance this Wednesday.”
Fans, commentators and critics alike broadly agree Koeman’s side are playing some of the country’s best soccer down on the south coast.
This term they have smashed eight goals past hapless Sunderland and remain the meanest defence in the top flight despite shipping three against the champions.
Even their most ardent supporters had long known, however, that their lofty position was due in no small part to an accommodating run of early fixtures.
The Arsenal game comes at the start of a six-week run in which Saints play both the Gunners and Manchester United twice as well as leaders Chelsea.
Burnley, Everton and Crystal Palace may offer some relative relief in that period, but these six weeks will provide the first real test of Southampton’s European ambitions.
It speaks volumes for Koeman, the staff at St Mary’s and Southampton’s players that European football is even a topic of conversation after a summer of high-profile departures that had the Saints’ installed as bookmakers’ favourites for the drop.
Sitting third, with 26 points from 13 games, how Southampton respond to what was a first home defeat will offer an insight into their ambitions.
Skipper Jose Fonte insists Arsenal are now in the cross-hairs as the Saints looks to bounce back immediately.
“We have to. There’s no time to think about negatives and losing. There’s no time. This is football,” he told reporters.
“Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. We lost against the champions. Obviously, we are not happy but there’s no time to think about what-ifs or stuff like that – it’s just focus on the next one.”
Southampton will be without French international playmaker Morgan Schneiderlin who is out with a thigh injury.

Islamic State attacks border checkpoint  kills 15 IraqpoliceBy: Associated Press | Baghdad |
Posted: December 1, 2014 8:27 pm
Islamic State militants attacked a checkpoint along the volatile Iraqi-Syria border on Monday, killing at least 15 Iraqi border policemen, officials said. The attack took place in the town of al-Walid on Iraq’s side of the border, according to a senior army official.
At least five officers were also wounded in the assault. A government official in Iraq’s Anbar provincial council confirmed the report but further details were not immediately available.
Since its blitz earlier this year, the Islamic State group has controlled most of the border crossings between Iraq and Syria. The Sunni militant group has also overrun a large part of Iraq’s Anbar and Ninevah provinces and now controls about one-third of both Iraq and Syria.
The attack came as the U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq said that 1,232 Iraqis were killed and 2,434 were wounded in violence and terror attacks in November. Of those killed, at least 296 were members of Iraqi and Kurdish forces, as well as militias who fight alongside them. The figures are a slight decrease from October, when the U.N. said at least 1,273 Iraqis had been killed.
Also last month, at least 402 people were killed in western Anbar province, according to the provincial Health Directorate, the U.N. mission said. Most of the victims died in the provincial capital of Ramadi, a battleground between the IS group and Iraqi troops. In Baghdad province, at least 332 people were killed in November, the U.N. said.
On Monday, at least eight people died in the Shiite town of Balad, 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of Baghdad, after mortar shells hit a cluster of homes and a small market. Police officials said a woman and a child were among the dead and at least 20 people were wounded.
Clashes are ongoing in Balad between Islamic State militants and Iraqi forces.All officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to media.

Delhi Metro may miss 2016 deadline for Phase-3Delhi Metro
(Progress of construction…)
NEW DELHI: Progress of construction work in Delhi Metro's Phase-III has been considerably stalled due to several land acquisition issues which may cause DMRC to miss its deadline to complete the project by 2016.
DMRC Managing Director Mangu Singh has stated as much in a letter submitted to the Delhi Chief Secretary D M Spolia earlier this month, seeking his intervention in the matter.
"DMRC has written a letter to the Chief Secretary detailing issues it is facing in taking forward the construction of Phase III that covers the longest stretch of land till date, a Delhi Metro spokesperson said, adding that a copy of the letter has also been sent to L-G Najeeb Jung.
DMRC is facing difficulty in acquiring land in several places which includes a patch of land that has been earmarked for rehabilitation of over hundred families of Block 15 of Trilokpuri, who will be affected by the construction of viaducts for the Mukundpur-Shiv Vihar route of phase-III.
"We have been provided with an alternative land by the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB). But the relocation of the families required for carrying out construction work has not begun," a Delhi Metro source said.
DMRC is facing difficulties in relocating the families as a section of the residents have refused to relocate to the land provided by DUSIB.
Upon completion, the phase-III of the Delhi Metro will add 140 km to the existing operational network stretching over 190 km.

Bank unions on relay strike from tomorrow after talks fail

(Banking services are likely…)
MUMBAI: Banking services are likely to be affected for the next four days as employees of PSU banks plan to go on a zone-wise relay strike beginning with Southern region tomorrow, after wage revision talks failed here today.
The decision came after talks at a conciliation meeting called by the Deputy Chief Labour Commissioner of Mumbai, the Indian Banking Association (IBA) and the United Forum of Banking Unions (UFBU) failed. The UFBU represents about five workmen unions and four officers' associations.
Accordingly, the first phase of the relay strike would be held in Southern India tomorrow (December 2), followed by Northern India on December 3, Eastern India on December 4 and Western India on December 5.
"The government and the IBA want us to call off our strike and then participate in negotiations, which is not acceptable to us," UFBU's convener for Maharashtra Vishwas Utagi said.
"They are not serious about wage revisions and so we are going ahead with our relay strike," Utagi, who is also senior vice-president of the All India Bank Employees' Association said.
Bank unions, which have demanded an immediate wage revision, had observed a national one-day strike on November 12.
Besides wage revision, bank unions have also demanded a reduction in the number of working days of employees to five days from six days as well as regulated working hours for officers.
Banking sector wages and service conditions are governed by industry-level bipartite settlements signed between the IBA and unions.
The last bipartite settlement was signed on April 27, 2010 and was valid from November 1, 2007 to October 31, 2012. All banks which gave mandate to the IBA to negotiate on their behalf are parties to the settlement.

How the Deep South turned red  animated.By Philip Bump December 1 Follow @pbump
If Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) loses Saturday's run-off election -- as she is very likely to do -- the Deep South will not have a single governor, senator  or state legislature that is in Democratic hands.
That's not necessarily permanent, of course, but it at least marks the end result of a long-term trend in the region toward Republicans. It's been stop-and-start; once a Senate seat or governorship has gone from blue to red over the past 30 years, it has occasionally flipped back the other way. And, particularly as demographics in the South shift, Georgia might start shifting back in the other direction. This is likely a nadir for Democrats, not a final resting place.
Using data from the National Conference of State Legislatures , we created this animation to illustrate how control of the state house, governorships and seats in the U.S. Senate has evolved in the states of the Deep South since 1978. (The number of seats in the House of Representatives has similarly become more red, of course.)
If Landrieu manages to win the run-off, Louisiana will remain yellow, as it is currently, with a senator from each party. That will likely hold until at least 2020.

Is dishonesty just part of the banking cultureBy Jena McGregor November 25 Follow @jenamcgregor
(Mary Cybulski/AP)
Six years after the financial crisis, little has been done to squash the caricature of the dishonest banker. Given the London Whale  debacle, the LIBOR fixing scandal , the massive  currency-rigging scheme  and other rogue traders , it's hard not to think something is still very rotten in the state of banking.
Could it be that the culture of banking itself promotes such corrupt behavior? A newly published study in the top journal Nature suggests that might be the case.
The study, by three researchers at the University of Zurich and the University of Chicago, had 128 banking employees take part in a lab experiment that tests honesty. It found that the bankers who were reminded of their profession before the test were far more likely to be dishonest than those who were not.
The lab test was a simple one: It had participants toss a coin ten times in private and then self-report their results, with the potential to earn up to $200 if their outcomes were better than their peers'. (Participants were told in advance of a toss whether "heads" or "tails" would be the winning result.) Thus, the incentive to cheat was strong.
“The idea behind the coin toss is that if everyone behaves honestly, we should observe that roughly 50 percent of contests are heads and 50 percent are tails,” said Alain Cohen, one of the study’s researchers. “But if we observe statistically more than that, we know some people might have cheated.”
Each bank employee was asked a series of questions before the test began. One half, the control group, were asked questions that were irrelevant to their careers, such as how much television they watch. The other half were asked about their careers in finance, such as where they’re employed, what the advantages and disadvantages of a banking career are, and why they decided to be a banker. “By reminding them of their professional role, we put the emphasis on their occupational identity, and that makes the norms that come along with their role more prominent in their behavior.”
Indeed. When the bankers in the control group reported their results, just three percent of the coin flips were misrepresented in an effort to get more cash. But among the group of bankers who were asked about their jobs, 16 percent of the coin flips were misrepresented. That group was also significantly more likely to agree with the statement that a person's social status is primarily decided by his or her financial success.
To make sure a reminder of any professional identity—or association with making money—wouldn’t prompt similar results, the researchers then ran their study on a group of students and a group of employees from the general public who hailed from a wide range of professions. In those studies, unlike the one with bank employees, the people who were first asked questions about their careers (in the case of the workers) or about the banking industry in general (in the case of the students) were not significantly more dishonest than their peers.
So does this mean banking leaders should try to find ways to make bankers forget what they do for a living? Prohibit them from wearing suits to work? Pull down the wood paneling from the walls? Hold meetings in coffee shops rather than on trading floors?
No, said Cohen. But it is important for finance CEOs to work harder to change cultural norms, such as ensuring that managers model good behavior at the lowest levels of the bank and making sure performance incentives don’t inadvertently reward dishonesty. “It would also be good to have a professional code like the Hippocratic oath ,” Cohen said. “Bankers would commit themselves to comply with the norms.”
The industry's image, after all, still has a lot of room for improvement. Cohen's study asked a general sample of people who they thought would cheat most on the coin flipping test—physicians, prison inmates, bank employees or people from the general population. Bankers were considered the most likely scammers, even more than prisoners.
In fact, the idea for the study, Cohen said, originally came from prior research by him and his co-authors, in which they asked inmates in prison to do a similar coin toss. “When you reminded criminals that they were criminals, they became more dishonest,” Cohen said. He was quick to note, however, that he was not drawing a parallel between bankers and criminals. “I don’t want to confuse people,” he said. “We should be careful. It was just the same methodology we used.”

Great leadership books for your holiday shopping listBy Tom Fox November 26
(Lillian Cunningham | The Washington Post)
As the holiday shopping spree begins, consider picking up a gift that's professionally useful—a good book to help you or someone on your list gain insight on leadership and work-related issues.
There are a number of volumes worth reading, whether you’re looking to inspire your team to operate more like a start-up, to create a culture of innovation or simply to deal with stress more effectively.
For anyone struggling with too much work and too little time, I recommend Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less  by Greg McKeown.
McKeown’s experiences are relatable, his research solid and his advice practical. I’ve taken some of his recommendations to heart personally and seen positive results. His basic thesis is that you need to figure out what is absolutely essential, and then eliminate everything else. In short, do less, but do it better.
Another good book is The Organized Mind: Thinking Straight in the Age of Information Overload  by neuroscientist and author Daniel Levitin. Levitin uses an approachable style to introduce the latest research to help managers gain a better grip around organizing their office, their home and their time.
In addition to strong organizational skills, a successful leader must use and analyze information to make decisions. Despite best efforts, leaders from the front lines to the executive suite can all be susceptible to ignoring important information needed to make the best possible choices. Max Bazerman’s book  The Power of Noticing: What the Best Leaders See  offers a step-by-step guide to discovering the information that others overlook and using that to improve strategic planning, daily decision-making and negotiation when conflicts emerge.
If you’re looking to energize your team, here are a few different options. You can look to modern American history and read Walter Isaacson’s latest book, The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution . Entertaining as all of his books are, The Innovators provides case studies of the diverse group of people who created the technology we rely on every day—computers, smart phones, tablets and the Internet. He also uncovers stories about the incredible women who played instrumental roles in developing our digital world, but who often have been relegated to the shadows as others enjoyed the spotlight.
One of my favorite business authors, Linda Hill, co-authored Collective Genius: The Art and Practice of Leading Innovation  with Greg Brandeau, Emily Truelove and Kent Lineback. The book looks at companies like Pixar, Google and IBM, and reveals how leaders can create a culture of innovation.
You might also check out Eric Schmidt’s book, How Google Works: The Rules for Success in the Internet Century . Google’s former CEO, along with co-authors Jonathan Rosenberg and Alan Eagle, suggests that the balance of power has shifted from the company to the consumer in the digital age, and that success requires hiring smart, creative employees who can consistently deliver great products and customer service. Given the ubiquity of Google, it seems that federal agencies struggling to connect with citizens might learn something from his experience around talent, corporate culture, communication and strategy.
If you want to leave the modern era, take a look at Harold Holzer’s new book, Lincoln and the Power of the Press . It sheds new light on Lincoln’s leadership abilities, and Holzer vividly demonstrates how Lincoln managed his relations with the press (sometimes by leaking information or planting favorable stories) to help shape public opinion as he sought to preserve the Union and abolish slavery.
Last but not least, you might look to our nation’s veterans as a source of inspiration this holiday season.
For Love of Country: What Our Veterans Can Teach Us About Citizenship, Heroism, and Sacrifice  offers a series of inspiring stories about the ordinary men and women in our military who perform extraordinary feats in service to our country. Written by Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz and Washington Post reporter Rajiv Chandrasekaran, the book not only looks at the contributions of soldiers on the battlefield but at their contributions to the community. The book highlights stories of veterans helping small towns rebuild after natural disasters, teaching inner-city students about leadership and academic success, and improving health care for other veterans suffering from traumatic brain injuries.
Tom Fox, a guest writer for On Leadership, is vice president for leadership and innovation at the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service. He also heads the Partnership’s Center for Government Leadership. He can be contacted at fedcoach@ourpublicservice.org .

Some free agent bullpen options for the NationalsBy James Wagner November 28 Follow @jameswagnerwp
GM Mike Rizzo. (Photo by Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)
It’s still early in the hot stove season, but the free agent and trade market will start to take clearer shape beginning next week. Other than trying to improve at second base, the Nationals aren’t necessarily pressed to make any moves. General Manager Mike Rizzo has said he is open to tweaking the bench and bullpen. Adding a reliever, maybe a veteran one, is perhaps the most prudent move.
According to people who have spoken with the Nationals over the last few weeks, the team is focused mostly on their current players (extensions, potential trades, etc.) and not as interested in free agency. The Nationals could always nab a reliever in a multi-player trade involving any of their players with one year left of control.
More relievers could appear on the market next week. Tuesday is the deadline for teams to tender contracts to arbitration-eligible players, and a few relievers may shake loose from other teams. Front offices can then fully evaluate the entire landscape of available arms. The Nationals have intriguing choices with two relievers, Tyler Clippard — who is projected to make more than $9 million in his final year of arbitration next season, an expensive price for a setup man — and Ross Detwiler — who is projected to make more than $3 million in his final year of arbitration next season but has seen his role diminish throughout last season.
If the Nationals decide to add a reliever through free agency to fill the void left by Rafael Soriano, the following are a few names to keep in mind: Jason Motte, Francisco Rodriguez, Casey Janssen, Pat Neshek, Sergio Romo and Luke Gregerson are all versatile right-handers who are capable of setting up and closing, perhaps as insurance for Drew Storen.
Rodriguez pitched some as a setup man in 2013 but is the most experienced closer of the bunch and is being pitched as a closer by his agent Scott Boras, who represents several Nationals players. Rodriguez will be 33 in January and has lost a tick on his fastball, but he saved 44 games for the Brewers last season and is walking fewer batters than his all-star seasons with the Angels. He did give up 14 home runs, mostly in the second half, and although he could work in Washington, his performance last season may make him too pricey for the Nationals.
Romo lost his closer’s role with the Giants during the season but was effective as a setup man in the second half, finishing with a 3.72 ERA and strong 0.948 WHIP. Neshek served as a setup man for the Cardinals last season, posting a 1.87 ERA and 0.787 WHIP while filling in as closer for a stretch. The performances of both would likely command nice multi-year contracts this winter.
Gregerson is the best of the remaining names and would immediately boost the Nationals bullpen. He has been one of the best setup men in baseball over the past few years and has picked up a handful of saves along the way. He has a 2.47 ERA and has averaged 66 innings per year over the past four seasons and he will likely command a sizable contract.
Janssen saved 81 games for the Blue Jays over the past season, posting a 2.94 ERA. He battled injury and illness and faded in the second half. His fastball sits in the low 90s, but he is a control pitcher; he has a career 2.2 walk per nine-inning rate, including a 1.4 BB/9 mark last season. Motte saved 42 games for the Cardinals in 2012 before undergoing Tommy John surgery in 2013. He returned last season, logging only 25 innings but hitting 97 mph late in the season. Both players could fit in the Nationals’ bullpen, and the team has shown some interest in them but the level is unclear.
>>> In an unrelated note, the Nationals are among “several” teams that have checked in about free agent second baseman/shortstop Adsrubal Cabrera, according to a person familiar with the situation. It is unclear how interested the Nationals are in Cabrera, who played well in Washington following his acquisition at the trade deadline but still had offensive and defensive limitations.
In the next few weeks, teams pursuing Cabrera will likely make harder pushes. Teams desperate for shortstops — such as both New York teams — could be competition for the Nationals, and the Athletics have also reportedly shown interest. The Nationals could also pursue two other infielders who fit what they’re looking for. With Ian Desmond’s future in Washington beyond 2015 unclear for now, the Nationals would be wise to find an infielder who can man second base in 2015 and, if Desmond departs via free agency, also handle shortstop in 2016.
A couple of players who may fit the Nationals’ needs are Jed Lowrie, who was with the Athletics last season, and Stephen Drew, who struggled immensely with the Red Sox and Yankees after signing late. Lowrie played shortstop last season, but at this stage of his career he could be best suited for second, where he has played some in the past.
Drew played mostly second base for the Yankees, his first major league stint at the position. Drew, according to a person familiar with the situation, could be interested in a short-term deal, perhaps a one-year contract that would allow him to reestablish his value. Drew is considered a strong defensive shortstop. Rizzo is familiar with Drew; he was with the Diamondbacks in 2004 when they selected the infielder in the first round of that year’s draft.
James Wagner joined the Post in August 2010 and, prior to covering the Nationals, covered high school sports across the region.

Analyst Corner: High valuations  tariff overhang negative forAPLSpiceJet shares continue to plunge; down 17 pct
Maintain ‘sell’ on Adani Power and price target of R45. The company is aggressively looking to grow inorganically. Adani Power is one of the most successful Indian power companies in project execution, with capacity growing from zero to 9,240 MW in about seven years. Now, the company is also trying to grow inorganically, with two acquisitions announced in last three months –1200 MW Udupi Plant of Lanco and 600 MW Korba plant of Avantha Power. This is interesting because the company has been reporting losses during the last several quarters and the debt-equity ratio is already very stretched.
As of September 30, Adani Power reported a net worth of R5,500 crore and loans of R46,000 crore. This is despite recognising R2,500 crore related to the compensatory tariff still under dispute with power buyers. The company is likely to pay R10,000 crore for these two acquisitions which will increase debt-equity ratio to 10x.
We think the company may needs to raise capital, and that this would be more likely to come from its owners as external equity funding looks unlikely. The issue related to compensatory tariff is an overhang and we continue to find the stock expensive versus fundamentals. Among independent power producers, NTPC remains the safer bet.

Demonstration aims to show 'how black dollars are clearly worth more than black lives'
Activists in Chicago called for boycotting holiday shopping on Michigan Avenue Friday as part of an ongoing effort to protest the grand jury decision not to indict a white police officer who fatally shot a black teen in Ferguson, Mo.
More than 50 demonstrators gathered at Water Tower for "Brown Friday" in hopes of dissuading Magnificent Mile shoppers with chants like "Freedom is the only option. If we don't get no justice, you don't get no profit."

"This is clearly about Mike Brown," said Malcolm London, whose group Black Youth Project 100 held a "die-in" inside City Hall earlier this week. "And how black dollars are clearly worth more than black lives."
The protest aims to encourage minority groups and others to express their dissent over the decision not to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson who shot and killed unarmed teenager Mike Brown, said organizer Kristiana Colon.
"We believe the Ferguson police, Chicago police and police forces all over America are more interested in protecting business, retail and commerce than lives," Colon said
Just wondering: wasn't that 95 year old white veteran in a nursing home shot by a black policeman? I don't recall the people who were outraged destroying their neighborhoods and marching on Michigan Avenue.

However, the organizers, who handed out fliers with information to passersby on where to support black-owned businesses, faced competition roughly 20 feet away, where retail employees doled out free $30 gift cards.
"A lot of people are walking around us and ignoring us -- and that's to be expected," Colon said. "A people are numb because we believe materialism numbs people.
"The fact that people are more concerned with a discount at Old Navy than a young man's life is why we're here."
Mike Archie, 47, of Albuquerque, ran into the demonstration after "sitting outside the benches of every store" as his four daughters, 11 to 19, shopped for clothes.
"I think it's good that people are expressing their minds," he said.
Archie found himself pleasantly surprised at Black Friday crowds.
"I'm surprised it's not busier," Archie said. "We thought today would be horrible, but it's about the same as yesterday."
About 300 protesters marched from the Chicago Police Department in Bronzeville to the Loop, where they were boxed in by Chicago police before they could cross into River North.
For their return, about 10 Chicago police officers stood across the street to watch protesters.
Organizers initially hoped to lead protests inside shopping centers like Water Tower Place, but decided against it, Colon said.
"We wanted to engage people for 4 1/2 hours, which is the time police left Mike Brown's body in the street," she said.

U.S. crude down 10 percent post-OPEC  Brent breaks below $70Oil drops below $59 for first time since 2009
By Alex Lawler, Reuters

International benchmark Brent crude has almost halved since reaching a 2014 high of $115 a barrel in June. Ample supply, slowing demand and a switch in strategy by exporter group OPEC to defending market share rather than prices have all hit crude prices.
0
A report showing Chinese industrial activity shrank for the first time in seven months in December added to concern about oil demand. China is the second-largest oil consumer after the United States.
Brent crude  fell as low as $58.50, its weakest since May 2009. As of 1442 GMT it was down $2.05 at $59.01 while U.S. crude  was down $1.86 at $54.05 a barrel.
"The trend remains down," said Robin Bieber, technical analyst and director at London-based oil broker PVM Oil Associates. "It is not advised to be long."
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries declined to cut production at a Nov. 27 meeting and, despite slumping prices, major Gulf OPEC members have since shown no sign of reversing course, seeing no need for an emergency OPEC meeting.
Russia's energy minister also said on Tuesday his country will not cut production. Before OPEC's meeting Russia, not an OPEC member, had hinted it could cut supply if OPEC did the same.
Weakening emerging-market currencies and economies - the drivers of growth in global oil demand - also weighed on prices, analysts said.
In Russia, one of the world's largest oil producers, the central bank hiked its key interest rate by 6.5 percentage points to 17 percent on Tuesday in an attempt to halt a collapse in the rouble.
In India, the Reserve Bank has been intervening in support of the struggling rupee, triggered by a worsening trade deficit, and in Indonesia the rupiah dropped to its lowest in 16 years against the U.S. dollar.
"The sharp decline in nearly all commodity prices and the weakening in commodity currencies creates headwinds for oil demand in the commodity-producing emerging markets in Latin America and the Middle East," Goldman Sachs said in a report.
"Historically these regions didn't contribute much to oil demand, today they do."

Questions surround IMET s decision to buy repurchase...Questions surround IMET's decision to buy repurchase agreements
By Ameet Sachdev, Tribune Reporter
Experts say they wouldn't have made IMET's bet
IMET took a gamble that other funds wouldn't, investment managers say.
An Oak Brook investment pool, which recently disclosed a $50 million trading loss involving taxpayer money, didn't follow the same safeguards to minimize risk as similar funds in Illinois and around the country, the Tribune has found.
Starting last year, the Illinois Metropolitan Investment Fund, or IMET, began buying complicated securities tied to government-backed loans.
The securities, known as repurchase agreements, or repos, have long been used by investors to park large amounts of cash rather than depositing the money in banks where only the first $250,000 is insured. Repos are considered relatively safe investments because they are secured by collateral.
But in IMET's case, the repos were a bad bet because the collateral turned out to be worthless.
IMET has said it is a victim of fraud, and federal authorities have charged a Florida man who originated the loans with fabricating loan documents.
  Open link
Investment pools entrusted with public funds normally only enter into repurchase agreements that are secured by U.S. Treasury bonds or other debt issued by U.S. government agencies. They are considered the highest quality collateral and can be easily liquidated.
IMET's collateral in the repo were private loans guaranteed by the U.S. Agriculture Department. But even with such a guarantee financial experts say they would have steered clear of such an investment in the first place.
"I wouldn't buy into guaranteed loans," said Mark Polistina, a portfolio manager.
Polistina runs a $5.7 billion investment pool operated by the Illinois treasurer's office on behalf of nearly 7,000 public entities. He said that in no case are loans of any kind, federally guaranteed or not, acceptable as a direct investment or collateral in the portfolio, known as Illinois Funds.
8
Martin Cassell, chief investment officer of a San Diego-based asset manager that works with public agency clients in California and Colorado, also was skeptical of USDA loans as collateral because they are not as secure or liquid as Treasury bonds or mortgage-backed securities issued by the Government National Mortgage Association, or Ginnie Mae.
"Technically these (Agriculture Department) loans were guaranteed, but do they fit into the spirit of what you are trying to achieve if they are not readily convertible into cash?" Cassell said. "It certainly raises some questions."
IMET officials declined to be interviewed. Randall Lending, IMET's outside lawyer, responded to written questions from the Tribune.
"IMET, like many other investment groups, has been the victim of financial fraud in this situation. The investments in question were made in safe and prudent investments, which were falsely represented as being backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government."
Nearly 300 Illinois municipalities, government pension funds and other public agencies trust IMET to manage their money. At a time of historically low interest rates, the fund has consistently delivered higher returns than Illinois Funds and similar investments, and as a result has been the recipient of a steady flow of cash.
IMET had a history of prudent management until it revealed the loss to its members last month. IMET's troubles have prompted its members to take a closer look at the fund's investments and some municipal treasurers have withdrawn their deposits to protect public funds.
IMET's $50.4 million loss constituted 2.8 percent of its "convenience" fund, one of two portfolios it manages. Participants in the convenience fund have had a proportionate amount of their funds frozen.
0
"I think that particular investment is being reviewed by everybody," said Maggie Bosley, finance director for suburban Glenview, which pulled out about $50 million from IMET after the village had $1.38 million frozen. "It raises a lot of questions. How was the investment approved? Was it a good investment?"
Government investment pools like IMET are common. They allow local governments to combine funds for investment, providing investment diversity and strategies that local governments may not be able to find on their own. The pools are vulnerable to investment losses like any security.
In Illinois, there is the state-managed pool run by the treasurer's office and a few pools like IMET created through interlocal cooperation agreements. IMET was established in 1996. IMET's board consists of eight suburban public officials.
IMET created the convenience fund in 2003, billing it as short-term, fully collateralized investment vehicle. According to IMET documents, the fund is run like a money-market mutual fund by trying to maintain a stable $1 share price.
The convenience fund's 12-month return as of Sept. 30, 2013, was 0.34 percent, compared with 0.05 percent for Illinois Funds, IMET said its in 2013 annual report.
Even though the Securities and Exchange Commission does not regulate IMET, the pool has sought to maintain safe investment strategies. Like most government investment pools, IMET is prohibited from investing in stocks, futures and options, and commodities.
The convenience fund comprises federally insured certificates of deposit; collateralized CDs; bank deposits collateralized by government securities; and repurchase agreements. As of Nov. 12, IMET said the convenience fund had $1.2 billion in assets and $358 million in cash.
The repurchase agreements are a relatively new addition to the portfolio.
Many highly liquid investment pools like IMET take advantage of the repo market to deploy idle cash more productively, according to Standard & Poor's, a credit-rating firm.
Repos are financial transactions in which an investor buys assets from a bank or securities dealer who agrees to buy the asset back on a prearranged date, sometimes the next day, at the same price plus interest. In effect, the investor is lending cash and holding assets as collateral.
At Illinois Funds, repos make up about one-third of the investments, said Polistina, who has managed the portfolio since 2002.
"You need to keep a large portion of the portfolio available as liquid investments," Polistina said. "Repos are the most marketable investments available and generally the safest. We buy repos every day."
Beginning in May 2013, IMET began investing in a repo backed by loans made by First Farmers Financial, a Florida-based lender. First Farmers said the loans were guaranteed by the USDA. The USDA offers the guarantee to encourage investment in rural communities.
IMET's repos were concocted by Pennant Management, a Milwaukee-based investment adviser the investment fund hired in 2012 after soliciting outside money managers. Pennant's proposal met IMET's needs for liquidity, safety and return, said Lending, IMET's attorney.
According to court documents filed by IMET, Pennant entered into a repurchase agreement with First Farmers in which it financed the Florida company's loans with funds provided by IMET and other clients. IMET said it was a third-party beneficiary to the repo agreement.
IMET said Pennant, prior to funding the loans, investigated First Farmers, including its chief executive officer, Nikesh Patel, and other executives. Pennant also informed IMET that the USDA had approved First Farmers to originate loans in the agency's guarantee program, which insures certain commercial loans of up to $10 million.
Repos are the most marketable investments available and generally the safest. We buy repos every day - Mark Polistina
By the end of August 2014, IMET had invested $50.4 million in the First Farmers repo. On Sept. 29 Pennant notified IMET that the repo was impaired. Federal authorities arrested Patel, 31, the next day. According to the criminal complaint, Patel falsified loan documents that reflected USDA guarantees. He has been released on bond.
In a civil lawsuit filed against Patel, Pennant said it funded and acquired 26 loans made by First Farmers with a total value of more than $170 million. A Pennant official declined comment. Pennant asked the USDA to honor the guarantee, but the agency has declined because the loans don't exist on the agency's books.

Game change: How social media can hijack bosses ...1
"These kinds of circumstances are going to happen over and over because of social media," said John Baldoni, an executive consultant and coach whose latest book is "Moxie: The Secret to Bold and Gutsy Leadership." "You just happen to have a radio station, which has a broadcast license. ... But these situations are not unique.
"This is the new reality. So companies have to think through how they handle, not just terminations, but any crisis situation. What's the appropriate way of getting information out? Remember the dignity of the individual. Be honest, straightforward and don't pull punches."
Employees complaining loudly about how they feel they're being treated may be the least of worries.
"There's a nother reality to this," Baldoni said. "Companies have to be cognizant of employee sabotage."
A companywide meeting in the event of a shutdown may be impersonal, but it lessens the likelihood that some employees will learn of their situation from someone else, who may or may not have all the correct information. Transparency, to the extent that it is possible, is in the best interests of everyone.
"I had a neighbor who was a high-ranking pharmaceutical executive and he had been through various mergers and acquisitions," Baldoni said. "He had done five town hall meetings in his career where he had to lay people off. He said it never got easier. But the one thing you do is you address people, you're straight. They won't like the news. But when you're honest and transparent, they'll respect the message. When possible, provide an antidote, which might be outplacement services, severance pay, all those sorts of things. But be straight to the point. Here's what the situation is and here's what we must do."
"Treat employees with dignity and respect. That gets lost sometimes," Baldoni added.
The confidentiality requirements of mergers and acquisitions and other secret strategic decisions may present real challenges to transparency, as it's not unusual to have different levels of management receive varying degrees of information, with everyone involved forbidden to say anything to anyone else. A company president may have to be all smiles at a Christmas party knowing a plant closing is coming in January.
But just as executives have had to come to terms with the idea that any email they ever send may someday be made public, they must manage to keep employees informed enough to feel connected and continue to trust the leadership.
"Gossip loves a vacuum, so if a boss doesn't say anything, there will be rampant rumors," Baldoni said. "It has to be straight and forward. It's not what people want to hear. Trust me. People want to hear they have lifetime employment. But that's not the reality of the situation.
"In our era of social media, transparency — whether you choose it or not — is a reality. As soon as you tell someone something, you're at risk of a breach."
Although The Game management had begun informing staff of its decision to shut down the low-rated, money-losing FM sports talk station at year's end, it mistakenly believed it controlled the timetable for going public, sitting on a news release awaiting distribution.
A lot of goodwill that station bosses thought they had evaporated when the news got away from them.
"I had respect for our bosses until about five minutes ago. They have not even come in the room yet to say, 'Sorry guys, that you had to find out this way.' How about something?" Finfer said on the air. "I saw those guys this morning. They were acting like everything was normal."
They were caught off guard by a new normal as surely as their news surprised Finfer.

Crystal Lee: Aspire to Outdo Yourselfreddit
This is part of the #CareerAdvice series --  featuring successful professionals who share their advice to people who would want to take their career to the next level.
Having identified the things she's passionate about early on, Crystal Lee shares the importance of doing what you love and loving what you do. Her positive mindset and can-do attitude has allowed her to work with multinational brands and companies such as Estée Lauder, Yahoo! and now as the country manager for Viber - Philippines.
Crystal Lee, Country Manager of Viber Philippines
Can you tell us a bit about how you started your career? What are some of your best moments in your professional life?
I was taking my 5th year Master's in Science of Management in UA&P and I was chosen to be one of the four interns to work for e-PLDT. From there, I was recommended to work for SMART Telecommunications, then got a Marketing Manager opportunity to lead a multinational brand - Estée Lauder .
It is from my experience at Estée Lauder where I learned a lot: about being disciplined, being numbers driven, being on-time, and being very detail-oriented.
I was also immersed in working with different backgrounds and cultures as our Headquarters was in Singapore and got to travel around Asia Pacific, work with and meet other Brand leads from other countries.
Then I moved to Yahoo! where I was able to use everything I learned in Estée Lauder and at the same time, Yahoo! gave me the opportunity to be creative, think about original ideas and concepts for the brand, which eventually were used in other countries and regions.
Having worked with Yahoo! was one of the best moments in my professional life. I spearheaded and implemented the Yahoo OMG! Awards -- Yahoo's signature event and online celebrity awards across Asia.
Now being the Country Manager for Viber Philippines for over a year now, I must say this is the highlight of my career as I challenge myself and try to bring marketing to the next level through unique brand concepts and executions.

Find something that you believe in and would want you to wake up excited and passionate. Also work with good people with the same values and passions. This will help you grow.
What has been the most valuable advice you've ever gotten when you were facing challenges in your career?
"Its just a job". Never lose yourself, no one ever said on their death bed: "I wish I worked more and stayed in the office more".
So learn to prioritize and value what's really important.
What would you advise the millennial just starting with their career or aiming to take their careers to the next level?
Always stay humble and learn from your mistakes. Having a big head and thinking you are the best stunts your growth and lowers your creativity as well as passion. Always aspire to outdo yourself.

Why We  Have A Responsibility  To Protect Big Catsreddit
It's no secret that big cats are in trouble.
Four of the five feline species that fall under that umbrella are endangered or near threatened: snow leopards , jaguars , leopards and tigers . Lions, whose populations once numbered close to 200,000, have lost most of their historical range to farms and could face extinction by 2050 . They face a slew of threats, from habitat loss and poaching, to retribution killings and the illegal pet trade.
For Boone Smith , a fourth-generation big cat tracker who cut his teeth trapping mountain lions in Idaho and star of Nat Geo WILD's upcoming show " Man v. Lion ," the fight to save these species is an "uphill battle" that we still have time to win. The Huffington Post spent time with Smith at a private game reserve in South Africa earlier this month to learn about the threats lions and other cats face as urban sprawl threatens to overtake all of the land once ruled by the king of the jungle.
This interview has been edited for clarity and content.
You grew up collaring mountain lions, why are they doing so well compared to other cats?
Cats in general have a lot of similarities, generalities that you can say “ok, all cats do this, do that.” The difference that I see is that the success for something like mountain lions versus African lions is maybe a little bit of the ability to adapt. African lions have lost a lot of habitat ... and when you’re a big animal like that and you need a big space and you don’t have that, conflict with humans is a little different. Whereas mountain lions, we talk about mountain lions a little different as living in deserts, jungles, the rockies and now we talk about urban mountain lions and their ability to adapt and live in California.
Lions are a little bit too big to go under the radar… and there’s that confidence, almost an arrogance of “I’m this big and bad and I’m going to do what I want.” Mountain lions aren’t like that, they’re secretive and shy and they’re elusive, so some of it’s personality, and differences in management, and that’s what makes it all great is that it's unique everywhere you go, and the animals are unique.
What kind of response do you have when you're tracking? Fear? Respect?
People always say “are you afraid,” and I say I’m always a little afraid, but I do a good job of keeping my head about me and processing things, but you have to show these animals a lot of respect. You think what the lifecycle of a big cat is, if you don’t kill, you don’t eat, and you die. So we’re talking about the best of the best in mother nature, and this has been honed, evolutionarily over millions of years, they’re really good at what they do, and you need to have a healthy respect for that.
Do you think most people have that sense of respect?
I guess it’s like anything, it’s what you’re used to, it’s time and experience and feeling comfortable.
So many times I hear people say “if we just leave them alone, we came into their world.” And I agree with that wholeheartedly, we did, we’ve encroached. The idea that we just leave it alone and it’ll fix itself, we have to take into account our effect, our footprint’s everywhere, we have such an impact whether we want to or not. And we don’t acknowledge that we are not collecting the best information. Acknowledging our screw ups, but our successes, we can do a lot for a lot of species, and I think we have a responsibility. Whether they were here first or not, we have a responsibility to make sure that there’s wild places, that there’s wild things there and that they can function in a natural environment. We're kind of guardians in that way a little bit and if we don't take that responsibility serious we’ve got great examples of how that’s caused big problems and impacts on ecosystems, and when you lose it, you don’t get it back.
What needs to be done to stop the downward trend?
Everybody wants a magic bullet, a fix-it-all, one thing that if we do this it will solve the problem, and it doesn’t exist. I think we really need to look at big picture things, education is so important, and that doesn’t fix problems, but when people are educated about it they are more likely to make compromises.
Why should we all work towards saving big cats?
Big cats are important because with them comes big wild places. Being able to go into the wild and be somewhere where you are not the top of the food chain, I think it really, it makes you alive. When I go to the wild places it’s a spiritual thing, it renews you it fires you up. I’m not saying we go there and get scared and be afraid that everything’s going to eat us and we’re going to die, but certainly I think it does something for us spiritually.
I think that’s good for us, because we lose touch of that. I love not being at the top of the food chain. It keeps you alive. You have to focus differently, you’re not glued to that phone, you’re looking up, you’re smelling these different things. I think it lets us reconnect with nature.
Nat Geo WILD 's fifth-annual Big Cat Week starts Friday, Nov. 28 and runs through Dec. 3. Tune in Friday to watch Boone Smith in " Man v. Lion " at 9 p.m. EST and again on Tuesday, Dec. 2 at 10 p.m.

Institution to replace Planning Commission likely to be unveiled in DecInstitution to replace Planning Commission likely to be unveiled in Dec
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Nov 30:  
Work has moved into top gear for finalising the name and structure of the new institution that will replace the 64-year-old Planning Commission and the same may be unveiled this December.
“The Prime Minister has convened a meeting of the Chief Ministers on December 7 to seek their view points on the structure of the institution which would ultimately replace the Planning Commission,” an official source said.
The Commission has received many suggestions regarding the name and role of the new body. Some of the suggested names are Sustainable Development Commission, National Development Agency, Social Economic Development Commission or Bharat Pragati Lakshya. Besides, there have been reports about the new body being named Niti Aayog or Policy Commission.
The new institution, which is likely to be headed by the Prime Minister as was the case with the Planning Commission, may have four divisions — an Inter-State council, plan evaluation office, UIDAI and DBT. All the divisions would have experts from the Centre and State governments as also experts from the industry.
The Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) Mission was earlier part the Planning Commission but was moved to the Finance Ministry later.
According to sources, the new body could also be the secretariat for the inter-State council, which is present under the Home Ministry and met rarely during the UPA term.
This council used to meet regularly during the previous NDA regime.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his Independence Day speech had announced that the Commission would be abolished and replaced with a more relevant institution.
Since then the Commission has held several meetings with experts to discuss the new structure of the proposed institution.
The country’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had set up the Planning Commission to steer the nation’s economic destiny at that time.
Set up by a Cabinet Resolution, the Commission has enjoyed power and prestige, with the Prime Minister as its Chairman. Its most important functions have been fixing targets for sectoral growth and allocation of resources.
The Deputy Chairman of the Commission has often been a political stalwart holding the rank of a Cabinet Minister.
Gulzarilal Nanda, V T Krishnamachari, C Subramaniam, P N Haksar, Manmohan Singh, Pranab Mukherjee, K C Pant, Jaswant Singh, Madhu Dandavate, Mohan Dharia and R K Hegde have been deputy chairmen at different points of time.
Montek Singh Ahluwalia was the last deputy chairman.

PM bats for SMART policingPM bats for SMART policing

Guwahati, Nov 30:  
Advocating the concept of ‘SMART’ policing, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said a country which has an efficient intelligence network does not need any arms and ammunition to run the Government.
Focusing on the police force and intelligence agencies, the Prime Minister said he wanted a force which takes care of the country’s law and order in an efficient manner.
“By ‘SMART’ policing, I mean S for strict but sensitive, M for modern and mobile, A for alert and accountable, R for reliable and responsive, and T for techno-savvy and trained”, Modi said while addressing the DGP’s conference here.
The police force should inculcate these values to ensure best policing, which will go a long way in improving its image and work culture, he said.
The Prime Minister also highlighted the need to honour 33,000 police personnel martyred in the country after Independence as “this was not a small number and their sacrifice should not go waste”.
The Prime Minister said the country can be run through an efficient intelligence network without much dependence on arms.
“The country which has a high class intelligence network does not need any arms and ammunition. So, it is very important to have a very high class intelligence network,” he said.
Modi said though a lot of good things were happening in the nation, positive stories should be published properly so that people are aware about them.
The Prime Minister said police welfare is another issue which needs to be given importance.
“An officer may be very good but it is important that his/her family is (kept) well,” he said.

Capex cycle revival key to Sensex hitting 36 000 target: Ambit CapitalSees FY' 15-16 GDP growth at 6%
New Delhi, Nov 30:  
Ambit Capital has put out a Sensex target of 36,000 for end March 2016, implying a 27 per cent upside over next five quarters.
Indian economy is expected to record 6 per cent growth in 2015-16, Ambit Capital said in a research note released on Friday.
A surge in earnings growth to 18-19 per cent levels in 2015-16 from the level of 12 per cent this fiscal will help achieve the Sensex target of 36,000 by end March 2016.
Ambit Capital expects Sensex EPS (earnings per share) to hit 1,790 by March 2016.
"It will be a slow cyclical recovery. Indian economy will chug along assisted by industrial recovery that will boost earnings growth", Saurabh Mukherjea, CEO of the Institutional Equities business at Ambit Capital told BusinessLine here.
The capital expenditure will have to largely come from public sector and the extent to which the fisc can afford it, he said.
The recovery in capex cycle would be a key in achieving the Sensex target of 36,000. Also, there will be no more PE (price earnings multiple) re-rating and it will all depend on earnings growth, Mukherjea said.
Ambit Capital has in the latest research note reiterated its long-held point of view that Indian economy and markets have entered their fourth wave--fourth cycle (of economic growth) of ten years.
"This (2014-15) will be the first year of three-to-four year recovery wave. The first three years of a ten year economic cycle is generally lucrative for the stock markets", Mukherjea said.
While this year has seen the Sensex go up by 36 per cent, the next year could also see it provide return of another 25 per cent, he said.
On RBI's likely monetary policy stance on December 2, Mukherjea said he does not see any need for RBI to cut policy rates now.

Rain clouds preparing to leave south peninsula over next few daysRain clouds preparing to leave south peninsula over next few days
Vinson Kurian
Tweet
Thiruvananthapuram, November 30:  
Coastal Tamil Nadu has been receiving moderate to heavy showers over the past few days as a low-pressure area persisted over southwest Bay of Bengal off Sri Lanka.
Indications are that these rains may lift over the next few days as rain bands get directed mostly towards Sri Lanka even as parts of central and northern parts of Tamil Nadu remain rain-deficit.
Dense fog
Towards the north and east of the country, dense fog conditions prevailed over Tripura, Assam and Meghalaya while shall fog hung over parts of rest of northwest India.
Bihar, east Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Madhya Maharashtra reported shallow fog as a warm western disturbance parked over north Pakistan extended its limbs across the international border.
The moisture content in the system was not enough to trigger snow or rain in the hills or the usual heavy fog (too early for the year, though) over the plains.
In the northeast, however, a cyclonic circulation over northeast Bay of Bengal is kicking up some moisture and fanning it inland to trigger heavy fog over Tripura, Assam and Meghalaya.
Temperatures
The warmth of the western disturbance has lifted the night-time temperatures in northwest India after associated clouds helped the region to retain solar radiation at the ground level.
The lowest temperatures was at 6.2 deg Celsius recorded at Amritsar during the 24 hours ending on Sunday morning.
They are above normal at many places over Jammu and Kashmir, Rajasthan, Gujarat, west Uttar Pradesh, west Madhya Pradesh, and adjoining areas.
The passage of the western disturbance to the east and northeast and out of the country would bring back the colder winds to prevail over the region after the next two days.
Colder winds
Meanwhile, night temperatures were lower by 2- to 4 deg Celsius over West Bengal, Sikkim, interior Karnataka, Madhya Maharashtra, Vidarbha, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and north Andhra Pradesh.
This meant that colder northwesterlies were blowing in from the plains of northwest India into central India and adjoining peninsular India. Absence of clouds allowed the cold winds a free run into the region.
Indications are that the minimum temperatures will fall further and extend coverage to southward since clouds are forecast to leave the extreme south, and along with it, the wet weather.
Central interior peninsula covering Karnataka, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh are likely to witness the chill unless weather conditions make a drastic u-turn.

Manufacturing PMI hits 21-month high; rate cut unlikelyHSBC manufacturing index at 21-month high
Shishir Sinha
Manufacturing activity accelerated in November led by higher output and new orders.
Consumer goods segment leads acceleration; foreign orders up
New Delhi. Dec 1:  
Led by the consumer goods segment, India’s factory output registered its fastest growth and a 21-month high in November, but inflationary pressure has also intensified, said an HSBC survey, on Monday.
The HSBC survey, which came just a day before the monetary policy review by the Reserve Bank of India, showed that the purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for November stood at 53.3, up from 51.6 in October. This has weakened the case for a rate cut by the RBI, feel experts.
“Manufacturing activity accelerated further in November, led by higher output and new orders. Domestic orders saw the biggest increase, even as new export orders continued to be strong. The sharp rise in input prices was surprising, but future prints may be lower as falling commodity prices eventually lead to softer intermediate goods prices,” said Pranjul Bhandari, Chief India Economist at HSBC.
The pick-up in output prices could partly be signalling some revival in pricing power among businesses, the survey said.
“Higher output and an up-tick in final prices should convince the RBI to hold rates in the upcoming meeting,” Bhandari said.
The PMI is a measure of factory production and based on responses of purchasing executives of around 500 manufacturing companies.
A score above 50 shows expansion, and anything less indicates a contraction.
Demand rising
The survey said that November data reinforced reports of stronger-than-expected demand, as new order growth accelerated to the quickest in 21 months.
Consumer goods were again the best performing of the surveyed sub-sectors. Similarly, foreign orders received by Indian goods producers continued to rise strongly in November, it said. Commenting on the survey, Rohini Malkani of Citi said that while the latest prints in the PMI price indices are surprising, “we maintain our view that the broad-based decline in inflation has opened the space for monetary policy to augment ongoing policy measures to revive growth”.
She added that “given the OPEC decision last week and the Indian rupee’s outperformance, one cannot rule out an outside chance of a surprise in the RBI policy tomorrow (Tuesday).”
Sonal Varma and Aman Mohunta of Nomura, in a note, said that the rise in the price indices indicates that there could be some up-tick in WPI inflation in November.
However, given the recent slide of commodity prices, “we expect input costs to fall next month, while output prices may remain largely unchanged as demand improves, leading to better corporate profit margins”, the note added.

LIMA, Peru (AP) — Energized by new targets set by China and the United States, the world's top climate polluters, U.N. global warming talks resume Monday with unusual optimism despite evidence that human-generated climate change is already happening and bound to get worse.
Negotiators from more than 190 countries will meet in the Peruvian capital for two weeks to work on drafts for a global climate deal that is supposed to be adopted next year in Paris. Getting all countries aboard will be a crucial test for the U.N. talks, which over two decades have failed to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming.
Pledges by Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Barack Obama earlier this month to limit their emissions after 2020 sent a powerful signal that a global deal could be possible next year. The two countries, which produce about 40 percent of all global emissions, long have been adversaries in the U.N. climate talks.
"Climate change will not be solved only by the United States and China. But it certainly will not be solved without them," U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres told The Associated Press.
Earlier this year, the European Union announced an emissions target for 2030, meaning the world's three biggest emitters have made pledges. The hope now is that other big polluters including India, Japan, Russia and Australia will set their goals.
In Lima, delegates hope to specify what information should be included when countries submit their formal emissions targets early next year, so that the targets can be compared against each other. There is little expectation, however, that negotiators will agree on enforceable legal terms. The U.S. and other countries oppose a legally binding emissions treaty, which would face stiff opposition in a Republican-controlled Congress.
The talks in Lima come just a month after a scientific assessment by the U.N.'s expert panel on climate change warned that rising global temperatures could have an irreversible impact on people and ecosystems as glaciers melt, sea levels rise, heat waves intensify and oceans become warmer and more acidic.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said it's now 95 percent certain that humans are to blame for most of the warming, mainly by burning oil, coal and gas. Those emissions keep rising as fossil fuels power the expansion of China and other emerging economies.
The delegates will be meeting in a country particularly threatened by the impact of climate change.
"Peru is hit from all angles," said Walter Vergara, a top Latin America climate change expert formerly with the World Bank. "Many ecosystems are going to be affected."
The Andean nation has 70 percent of the world's tropical glaciers, which are melting at an accelerated pace, putting 300,000 highlanders under severe stress as pastures and croplands slowly dry up.
Those glaciers have lost more than one-fifth of their mass in just three decades, and the 70 percent of Peru's 30 million people who inhabit the country's Pacific coastal desert, depend on glacial runoff for hydropower and to irrigate crops, meaning their electricity and long-term food security could also be in peril. Higher alpine temperatures are killing off plant and animal species in cloud forests and scientists predict Pacific fisheries will suffer.
The overall goal of the U.N. talks is to keep the average global temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees F) compared with pre-industrial times. That would require a massive energy shift to renewable sources and, perhaps, capturing airborne CO2 and storing it underground.
The U.N. Environment Program earlier this month warned that there's a growing gap between what countries promise to do about carbon pollution and what scientists say needs to be done to meet that goal.
And global temperature data show 2014 is shaping up to become one of the hottest — if not the hottest — years on record.
"We're still heading in the wrong direction," said Andrew Steer, the head of the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based environmental group.

Jewellery stocks shine on relaxed import restrictionsJewellery stocks shine on relaxed import restrictions
BL Research Bureau
December 1, 2014:  
Markets may be lethargic but jewellery stocks are on fire.
The biggest gainers in this pack feature Gitanjali Gems and Shree Ganesh Jewellery House, up 20 per cent, TBZ which is up 15 per cent, Tara Jewellers and Thangamayil Jewellery, up around 9 per cent in trade so far. Further down the gainers list at 5-7 per cent are Titan Company, PC Jewellers, Tara Jewellers and Rajesh Exports.
What is spurring these stocks is the Reserve Bank scrapping the 20:80 gold imports rule last Friday, having partially relaxed it earlier this year. This, together with easing of gold-on-lease model, also earlier this year, means a better raw material availability for jewellery companies.
Domestic players
The 20:80 gold import rule, which was put in place last July, required nominated banks and agencies to export at least 20 per cent of their gold imports. This was to clamp down on imports to curb the current account deficit. These measures raised domestic gold premiums, pressuring jewellers’ margins besides tightening raw material supply.
The complete relaxation in this rule is good news, especially for domestic jewellers who do not have a high export component such as Titan Company, Thangamayil, PC Jewellers and TBZ. Shrinking domestic gold premiums can prop up margins. The eased import rules jives well with international gold prices trending steadily lower. Finally, quite apart from a cheaper and easier input scenario, consumer demand may also receive a shot in the arm with lower gold prices.

Cong red flags Govt s plan for cut in social sector expenditure  raises issue in Lok SabhaBy: Press Trust of India | New Delhi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 3:28 pm | Updated: December 1, 2014 3:31 pm

Nirbhaya Fund still remains unspent : Aam Aadmi Party
Inauguration of a civic garden at Matunga in north Mumbai today witnessed commotion, when local Congress leaders questioned Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray’s presence in the ceremony.
Thackeray had been invited to inaugurate a reconstructed portion of ‘Five Gardens’ in Matunga. The garden is developed by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), which is ruled by the Shiv Sena.
During the inauguration ceremony, local Congress leaders questioned why the Sena chief had been invited for the function claiming that the development of the garden was done by the Congress.
Congress corporator Nayana Sheth, who was present at the event said, “When the work of this garden has been done by us, why should you (Thackeray) be inaugurating it?”
“Balasaheb (Thackeray) used to say that the credit for development work should be given to local corporators. So you should not be inaugurating the garden and taking credit for the work,” she said.
Responding to this, the Shiv Sena chief said he was not there to seek credit.
“I am not interested in taking credit for the work done here. This is irrelevant. What’s important is that development has been done. Development should be our motto,” Thackeray said.
Meanwhile, responding to a query on whether Sena will join the BJP government, Thackeray said, “We have not taken any decision on power sharing as yet.”

Vijay Mallya Denied Reappointment as Kingfisher Airlines ChiefYou are here: Home Corporates
Vijay Mallya Loses Posts at Kingfisher Airlines, Mangalore Chemicals
Press Trust of India | Updated On: December 01, 2014 22:50 (IST)
Court Refuses to Let Off Hindalco in Coal Block Case
New Delhi: In a double whammy for businessman Vijay Mallya, the government has annulled his reappointment as managing director of Kingfisher Airlines while he also had to quit from board of another group company Mangalore Chemicals and Fertilizers Ltd (MCFL).
This comes close on the heels of minority shareholders of United Spirits, once a prized entity of Mr Mallya-led UB group, rejecting proposals regarding proposed financial dealings of the company with entities connected to him.
Kingfisher, which had to be grounded in October 2012 due to severe financial crunch and mounting debt, had sought approval of the Corporate Affairs Ministry for Mr Mallya's reappointment for a period of five-year beginning October 16, 2013 "without remuneration".
The airline said in a regulatory filing on Monday that its application has been rejected, without disclosing any specific reason.
Government sources, however, said that the decision was taken because Kingfisher failed to get necessary approvals from its lenders and shareholders for the reappointment.
The disclosure came on a day when another UB Group firm Mangalore Chemicals and Fertilizers Ltd (MCFL) announced Mr Mallya's resignation as a director without giving any reason.
Trading in shares of Kingfisher and another group firm UB Engineering also got suspended from the same day because of the companies' non-compliance to listing norms.
Kingfisher, which once prided itself as the most luxurious airline with Mr Mallya being known as the 'King of Good Times', alone used to command a market value of over Rs 10,000 crore at a time, which now stands at just about Rs 100 crore.
The overall UB group market value has tanked by over half in the past one year excluding United Spirits.
The penal action by stock exchanges followed the companies' inability to prepare and publish financial results in time, which the firms have attributed to lack of staff.
Kingfisher has previously faced strong staff protests for non-payment of salaries, while it is also under regulatory scanner for various accounting lapses.
As per the latest disclosures made to the stock exchanges, Mr Mallya was serving as chairman and managing director of Kingfisher, which has been without a full-time CEO ever since Sanjay Agarwal left the company early this year.
As per the norms, a company which is in the red or has inadequate profits, needs to approach the Corporate Affairs Ministry to get approval for appointment of key managerial personnel and directors and get no-objection certificates from shareholders and lenders.
The ministry rejected the proposal in this case as it was already turned down by shareholders and lenders, sources said, while adding that this particular decision was not directly linked to Mr Mallya being declared a 'wilful defaulter'.
The UB group, which once commanded huge market values for all its entities in businesses ranging from liquor to fertilisers to aviation, has been facing financial troubles for past couple of years and a severe cash crunch led to Kingfisher Airlines being grounded over two years ago. There are also pending service tax default cases against the airline.
Default on loan payments has already seen a number of banks resorting to legal options to reclaim their funds, while some of them have also declared Mr Mallya as a wilful defaulter. Among various key assets, UB Group sold a controlling stake in United Spirits Ltd (USL) to UK-based global liquor giant Diageo, while MCFL recently saw two rival bidders slugging it out in the marketplace for getting a control of the company.
Without giving any specific reason, MCFL in a regulatory filing on Monday said, "Vijay Mallya, a Director on the Board of Directors of the company, has resigned with immediate effect."
The resignation of Kolkata-born Mr Mallya, 58, at MCFL followed an intense takeover battle between West Bengal-based Zuari group and Pune-based Deepak Fertilisers for wresting control of MCFL, which has a urea plant at Mangalore.
The plant has been shut since October this year due to expiry of permission given by the government for production of farm nutrient from high cost feedstock naptha.
Bangalore-headquartered UB Group chairman Mr Mallya had sided with the Zuari group and launched the counter open offer to ward off the takeover bid of Deepak Fertilizers.
Deepak Fertilisers has raised its stake in MCFL to about 32 per cent, as against Zuari-UB group's combined stake of 38.4 per cent.
The latest developments at Kingfisher and MCFL follow decisions by USL shareholders at a November 28 meeting to reject nine out of 12 resolutions, including some pertaining to proposed pacts with entities connected to Mr Mallya.
These pacts included those dated September 30, 2011 and December 22, 2011 between USL and United Breweries Holdings Ltd that required UBHL to sell certain immovable properties to USL.
Other resolutions which were defeated with a requisite majority include approval of a services agreement dated July 3 2013 between USL and Kingfisher Finvest India, approval of a sponsorship pact dated June 11 2013 between USL and United Racing & Bloodstock Breeders, approval of a sponsorship pact between USL and United Mohun Bagan Football Team Pvt Ltd.
USL is now controlled by Diageo, which had acquired an additional 26 per cent shares in USL for Rs 11,448.91 crore in July with an aim to take its total stake in the Indian firm to 54.78 per cent.
Liquor baron Vijay Mallya was recently re-elected as non-executive director and chairman of United Spirits. Kingfisher Airlines is already facing a close regulatory scrutiny over suspected lapses in its accounting practices and the Corporate Affairs Ministry is looking into possible violations of the Companies Act.
The carrier is yet to submit its annual financial results for 2013-14 to the stock exchanges.
In a filing to the BSE on August 26, the carrier had said that steps were being taken to appoint directors in order to comply with provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and listing agreement with the stock exchanges.
"Thereafter, steps will be taken towards publishing the audited results for the year ended March 31, 2014 and for the quarter ended June 30, 2014," it had said.
Back in May, Kingfisher had informed stock exchanges, "There are hardly any employees attending office and the company is currently operating with skeletal staff making it difficult to audit and publish the results in time."
As part of the recovery process, banks in February last year decided to sell a portion of the collateral with them, including shares of its group companies USL and MCFL, Mr Mallya's Goa villa, Kingfisher House in Mumbai and the Kingfisher brand, which was valued at over Rs 4,000 crore at the time it was pledged.
Total market value of the UB group companies currently stands at Rs 33,000 crore largely because United Breweries (over Rs 20,000 crore), where Heineken group is a co-promoter.

Morning Plum: Republicans have a simple response to Obamas immigration tyrannyBy Greg Sargent December 1 Follow @theplumlinegs
With Congress returning to town, GOP leaders are under sustained and intense pressure from the right to use creative defunding tactics — ones that could lead to a government shutdown — to force President Obama to relent on his executive action to shield millions from deportation.
But some Republicans have begun suggesting another, even more novel response to Obama’s move: Legislating.
The Hill reports that some Republicans say the best course of action is to try to seize control of the immigration debate by acting on reform:
“The best way to criticize governing through fiat is to offer an alternative,” said Republican activist Grover Norquist.
“What appears to be the smart move, and what they’re going to do, is do immigration reform through normal legislative [channels],” said Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform. “Do it in a way that Republicans find acceptable, meaning take the border seriously [and] think of America’s economic needs. Move forward on that and let him [Obama] be over in the corner stamping his feet.” [...]
“We have an obligation to do something — the ball is in our court — and in spite of whatever political considerations there may be on this, the public is ultimately going to judge us on whether we’ve found a solution to this problem or not,” said Al Cardenas, former head of the American Conservative Union, who’s now pushing Republicans in Congress for reforms. [...]
Rep. Mike McCaul (R-Texas), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, is crafting legislation to bolster border enforcement….Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the incoming chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Republicans are considering “a number of things” on immigration, including proposals “to nullify” Obama’s recent executive action.
Good. If Republicans don’t like this executive action, they have a recourse: They can try to pass something replacing or rescinding it. To be clear, I’m not arguing that the failure of Republicans to legislate on this issue alone constitutes justification for Obama’s action. (Many legal experts agree the action is legal on its own, and granting its legality, it’s also justifiable on its own merits .) Rather, the point is that Republicans who believe Obama is exceeding his authority can pass something designed to tighten up immigration law and restrict this particular exercise of that authority.
As Republican lawyer Margaret Stock has put it , immigration statute is “chock-full of huge grants of statutory authority to the president,” meaning that “Congress gave the president all these powers, and now they are upset because he wants to use them.” Which is also to say that Congress can take that authority away. Indeed, that’s exactly what House Republicans tried to do last year when they passed a measure rescinding the authority to defer the deportations of immigrants brought here illegally as children.
Presumably, if Republicans do try to pass limited immigration reforms like those discussed above, they would include new measures rolling back Obama’s latest actions. Democrats would try to block them in the Senate, and if that failed Obama would veto them. So the standoff would continue, particularly since there is no indication that Republicans are willing to entertain the goal of legalization for the 11 million in the new round of legislative responses now being mulled. This has always been the central cause of Congress’ inaction on this issue: Republican leaders know some form of legalization has to be part of the overall solution, but have proven unwilling to do the hard work of figuring out what real-world policy tradeoffs would make it possible for them to embrace that goal — and have been unwilling to brave the rage from the right that would inevitably result.
And so, a GOP legislative response probably won’t defuse the stalemate, and the executive action would remain. Which is why conservatives are demanding the GOP response go further and include defunding tactics. It’s unclear whether GOP leaders will ultimately go that route. But for now, it’s worth reiterating that a legislative response actually does remain as a feasible course of action, and it’s good to see some Republicans are pointing that out.
*****************************************************
* BOEHNER WARY OF GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN: The New York Times reports that Speaker John Boehner and his aides are working to persuade rank and file members that using government funding fights to battle Obama’s deportation relief is folly and doomed to fail . In one private meeting:
Mr. Boehner, according to those present, promised to fight the president “tooth and nail.” But he warned that the party members needed to coalesce around a strategy that gives them a stronger chance of success in combating Mr. Obama. Only Republicans, he said, would be blamed for a shutdown, just as they were last year.
Government shutdown fights institutionally favor presidents over Congress . The question, though, is: Can Boehner get enough Republicans to pass government funding that doesn’t defund Obama’s executive action? If not, then what?
* GOP WOULD TAKE BLAME FOR SHUTDOWN: A new CNN poll suggests Boehner is right to fear Republicans would get the blame:
If the federal government shuts down, do you think that Barack Obama or the Republicans in Congress would be more to blame for that?
Obama: 33
Republicans: 50
Both: 13
Also, the poll finds that 68 percent say Republicans are not doing enough to cooperate with Obama, while 57 percent say the same about the president.
 * REPUBLICANS MULL PARTIAL SHUTDOWN: Ginger Gibson explains the latest strategy making the rounds :
Republicans are looking at a partial option: Fund the government until September 2015 – what Democrats want – except the parts of the government that execute immigration functions…The immigration parts of the government would be funded only until early next year, when Republicans control the Senate and they can use the leverage of a partial shutdown to try to force Obama to reverse himself. To fully use that leverage, those parts of the government might actually shut down. And the pieces that would be lost are the ones that Republicans like, enforcement and deportation operations.
Yeah, that does present a problem, doesn’t it. But whatever it takes!
* DEMS WON’T ‘ENABLE’ GOP SHUTDOWN STRATEGY: Roll Call reports that House Democrats are vowing that they won’t participate in any GOP strategy of funding most of the government (minus the parts executing Obama’s action). Theoretically this could make it even harder for Republicans to pass something keeping most of the government open, if House conservatives decide it isn’t an aggressive enough strategy and defect. Fun times!
 * REPUBLICANS KNOW SHUTDOWN WILL FAIL: Politico brings an interesting tidbit of reporting : on how GOP leaders — Boehner, Kevin McCarthy, and Steve Scalise — are plotting to deal with the problem they face:
Inside Republican leadership, senior aides and lawmakers freely admit that the executive order — no matter how unpopular it is — will likely stand and there’s little Congress can do about it. So Boehner, McCarthy and Scalise need to craft a process that will allow conservatives to vent, but prevent a shutdown.
Because everything must be geared towards “allowing conservatives to vent,” whatever the consequences…
* OBAMA ACTIONS WILL CLARIFY CHOICE FOR VOTERS: E.J. Dionne writes today that Obama’s executive actions will challenge Republicans in ways that will helpfully clarify the contrast between the two parties, and not just on immigration, on climate, too:
Obama’s executive actions on immigration squarely challenge congressional Republicans to put up or shut up on their claims that they actually want reform…The Obama administration moved on another front last week to curb ozone emissions linked to asthma and heart disease. Republicans said they would try to block the new anti-pollution regulations. Okay, let’s fight it out. Again, conservatives will have to explain why they want to reverse an initiative rather than obstruct action altogether and then blame Obama for being ineffectual.
Of course, they can also just continue chanting about #ObummerTyranny, secure in the knowledge that this will keep the accolades coming from the Conservative Entertainment Complex.
* DON’T FORGET ABOUT THE LEGAL CHALLENGE TO OBAMACARE: Don’t miss law professor Nicholas Bagley’s detailed response to the legal argument, to be heard by the Supreme Court this spring, that could gut Obamacare subsidies in three dozen states . As Bagley notes, the evidence is overwhelming that Congress never assigned the weight to the key phrase — “exchange established by the state” — that the challengers’ argument claims.
Of course, five SCOTUS justices could simply shrug and say, tough luck!

The U.S. militarys long  weird Star Wars fascinationBy Dan Lamothe December 1 Follow @danlamothe
The first teaser trailer of "Star Wars: The Force Awakens," the Disney-backed feature directed by J.J. Abrams, which opens in theaters Dec. 18, 2015. (Disney)
The first movie trailer for the heavily anticipated “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” premiered online Friday, bringing with it immediate buzz about a new kind of lightsaber , a potential deserter stormtrooper and a revamped Millennium Falcon spaceship .
“Star Wars” has captivated millions of viewers over the last few decades with its good-versus-evil themes, colorful alien characters (Jabba the Hutt, anyone? Anyone?) and futuristic technology. But it isn’t just science fiction fans who gravitate to the franchise. There’s a long history of scholars, media outlets, defense contractors and active-duty troops connecting the U.S. military with the franchise.
Consider the following:
Hand prosthetics
Super-villain Darth Vader famously severed Luke Skywalker’s hand in a lightsaber battle, moments before revealing to Skywalker that he was actually his father (cue heavy mask breathing). The Jedi pupil’s injuries prompted a nickname for a robotic arm that was approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration for use by amputees this year. The DEKA Arm System was developed in part with funding from the Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, with wounded veterans in mind.
The system is “affectionately” dubbed “Luke,” its maker, DEKA Research and Development Corp., of Manchester, N.H., says on its Web site . Here’s a video of it in action:
Acquisition lessons from the ‘Dark Side’
Air Force Lt. Col. Dan Ward wrote an article in the Defense Department’s acquisition journal in 2011 that created a fair amount of buzz by saying the military should take lessons that Darth Vader missed in his own galaxy and apply them at home. His basic point: In building enormously complex weapons like the Death Star, the Galactic Empire left itself vulnerable.
“From a design perspective, a system as enormously complex as a Death Star is more than any program manager or senior architect can handle, no matter how high their midi-chlorian count is,” Ward wrote. “There is bound to be an overlooked exhaust vent or two that leads directly to the reactor core. That is just the sort of vulnerability an asymmetric opponent can exploit. In my professional engineering judgment, a flaw of this type was inevitable.”
By contrast, Ward notes, vacuum-cleaner lookalike droid R2-D2 makes numerous vital contributions, and cost a small fraction of what the Death Star did.
“Whether it’s repairing the Millennium Falcon’s hyperdrive, destroying a pair of Super Battle Droids, conveying a secret message to old Ben Kenobi or delivering Luke’s light saber at the critical moment on Jabba’s Sail Barge, he’s always got a trick up his proverbial sleeve,” Ward wrote.
Laser cannons for military craft

Lockheed Martin and DARPA turned heads in September by announcing progress on a gun turret for airplanes that would fire laser beams at enemy targets. Flight tests over the next year will test the weapon in increasingly complicated operations, Lockheed officials said.
The news sparked a flurry of Star Wars-themed headlines. “DARPA testing planes with a ‘Star Wars’-style laser cannon,” reported the tech Web site CNET . “DARPA Tests Out Planes Mounted With Laser Turret,” said Ubergizmo , wondering if “we could be looking at some sort of Star Wars future?”
Similarly, the Navy recently deployed a laser gun on the USS Ponce in the Persian Gulf, giving the service the ability to take out drone boats or aircraft and other small targets.
“Some of the Navy’s futuristic weapons sound like something out of ‘Star Wars,’ with lasers designed to shoot down aerial drones and electric guns that fire projectiles at hypersonic speeds,” The Associated Press reported in February , noting the project’s development.
Jedis and stormtroopers on U.S. bases
Look no further than the photographs the U.S. military releases to see the affinity for “Star Wars” in the active ranks. For example, here is a photo taken last year at a Star Wars Day at Camp Lejeune, N.C.:

That is clearly a Jedi in training.
In another example this year, the New York Air National Guard released a feature story about an airman who was involved in the 501st Legion, a Star Wars re-enactors group. Staff Sgt. James Bavaro got the urge to wear an Imperial Clone Trooper outfit just before deploying to Afghanistan for the first time, he said.
“My roommate threw me a going away party before I deployed,” Bavaro said. “A couple of guys from the 501st showed up in costume. After that, I knew I wanted to be a member. So my buddy Eric gave me a suit so I could get in.”
He is pictured at right.
The Pentagon has its own Yoda
For at least a few more weeks, the Pentagon’s own Yoda is serving.
Andrew W. Marshall, 93, is expected to retire as the head of the Office of Net Assessment, in January, according to a Defense News report . He founded the Pentagon’s internal think in 1973, and has stuck around for more than four decades since, earning him the nickname Yoda .
The future of the think tank was considered in question last year , as defense officials assessed how to cut the Defense Department budget. It survived, but Marshall has still decided it is time to step down, Defense News reported.
The original Star Wars program
Of course, there is also the Defense Department’s “Star Wars” program, which President Reagan proposed in a speech on March 23, 1983 , to counter growing Soviet military power.
The Strategic Defense Initiative was designed to intercept enemy nuclear missiles, rather than having the United States rely solely on the threat of massive retaliation to deter a nuclear attack. Funding for it was reduced at the end of the Cold War, and it was eventually reorganized to focus on ballistic missile defense.
The Star Wars nickname for Reagan’s plan was not all positive. Critics — including some in the Pentagon — called it that to make it clear they thought his vision was unaffordable and too futuristic to ever work.

North Koreas cyberwar on James Franco and Seth RoganBy Anna Fifield December 1 Follow @annafifield

SEOUL – Say you’re the dictator of the most closed state on earth, used to being revered as a god, and a bunch of Americans make a movie in which they attempt to assassinate you.
How do you get revenge? Well, the usual old fireworks – missiles and maybe a nuke test – won’t be much noticed by those Hollywood types. You’ve got to hit them where it hurts.
Well, North Korea – apparently – made Sony Pictures double over as it prepares to release "The Interview," the comedy in which James Franco and Seth Rogen play two journalists who land a rare interview with Kim Jong Un and are recruited by the CIA to take him out. The movie is due to be released in the U.S. on Dec. 25.
When news of the film emerged in June, North Korea vowed "merciless counter-measures" if it were released. It appears to have made good on that promise with a devastating cyber attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment, knocking out the studio's computer network on Nov. 24.
Sony Pictures Entertainment, which recently suffered a cyber attack on its computer network, is investigating if hackers working on behalf of North Korea might be responsible. (Reuters)
Attackers operating under the name “Guardians of Peace” left a picture of a red skull and the phrase "Hacked By #GOP" on the computers screens of Sony employees on the Monday before Thanksgiving.
The message threatened to release sensitive data supposedly stolen from Sony servers if certain demands were not met, the technology Web site Re/code reported .
Sony was exploring the possibility that hackers working on behalf of North Korea, perhaps operating out of China, might be behind the attack, Re/code reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.
Sony wouldn’t comment on the possible North Korea connection. But a spokesperson said: "The theft of Sony Pictures Entertainment content is a criminal matter, and we are working closely with law enforcement to address it."
The word from North Korea had the cliffhanger quality of a good Hollywood trailer. "Hostile forces" are casting blame on North Korea, said a spokesman for the country's mission at the United Nations, according to the Reuters news agency. "I kindly advise you to just wait and see."
Some of Sony's systems were understood to have been restored on Sunday, and e-mail was due to be back up and running Monday.
The Wrap, a Hollywood news site, reported that at least five new movies from Sony Pictures were posted to copyright-infringing file-sharing hubs online soon after the attack. They included the musical “Annie” and the Brad Pitt World War II movie “Fury.” However, it said that there was no proof that the films’ postings are related to the hack.
Based on a screenplay by Dan Sterling, "The Interview" tells the story of two celebrity journalists (James Franco and Seth Rogen) who land an interview with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on their popular television show, only to have the CIA ask them to assassinate him. (Sony Pictures)
Although no one but the most elite of the elite has access to the Internet in North Korea, the Kim regime has been building quite a cyber army and it has a record when it comes to devastating cyber attacks.
Pyongyang was blamed for a massive hack on South Korean sites – including government, media and banking sites – last year that coincided with the anniversary of the start of the Korean War.
Separately, the Wall Street Journal reported that “The Interview” will not be released in South Korea . Local media reports cite a Sony Pictures Korea official as saying the distributor never had plans to release the film there due to concerns about inter-Korean relations.
Luckily for interested South Koreans, there are lots of people south of the border who are also pretty good when it comes to technology.

Gifts for book lovers  from a penny to Christian Greys bathroomBy Ron Charles December 1 Follow @roncharles
Courtesy of New York magazine.
If you’re stuck for ideas on Cyber Monday, New York magazine has suggestions for even the most generous holiday shopper. Nothing says “I love you” like a new helicopter from Airbus for $8.5 million.
But gift-givers with a more literary mindset will find plenty of reasonably priced items in the magazine’s g ift guide . In fact, the whole feature starts off with books for a penny.
Alexis Swerdloff, the magazine’s Strategist editor, says, “The fact that you can buy anything officially in this day and age for a penny, especially online, is kind of amazing.” Determined to start their gift guide at that lowest possible monetary unit, she and her term dug around the used books offerings on Amazon and found “there are tons and tons of beautiful, perfectly weathered paperbacks going for one cent — plus shipping and handling.”
She mentions, among several treasures, a George Giusti-designed edition of S.J. Perelman’s “Crazy Like a Fox,” Edward Gorey’s version of Joseph Conrad’s “Victory,” and a Ben Shahn-illustrated “Three Lives.” (Amazon CEO Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)
For the bookworm with more than a penny to spare, the magazine provides a number of other modestly priced literary gift suggestions, including:
* “This Equals That” ($19.95), a clever picture book by Jason Fulford and Tamara Shopsin.
* A boxed set of John Green’s YA novels, “Looking for Alaska,” “An Abundance of Katherines,” “Paper Towns” and, of course, “The Fault in Our Stars” ($42.96).
(Courtesy of Cicada)
* “ Sunrise to High-Rise : A Wallbook of Architecture Through the Ages,” by illustrator Lucy Dalzell ($24.95).
* “To Wit,” a book of Raymond Pettibon drawings, which Swerdloff suggests buying “in order to tear out the pages and frame” ($45).
* A first edition of “Bridge to Terabithia,” signed and annotated by Katherine Paterson. Price will be determined on Tuesday when this copy is auctioned off to benefit the PEN America Center .
The writer in your life might appreciate the J. Herbin Scented Fountain Ink Sampler ($22), including orange, rose, apple and lavender. Since that aromatic ink is likely to make your loved one feel even more self-conscious about his horrible handwriting, send him to London for a handwriting course with Cherrell Avery ($352).
But why stay stuck on paper when the 3Doodler pen ($99) allows you to write in three dimensions?
If that can’t drive your book lover to new heights of ecstasy, it’s time for the ultimate literary-bathroom appliance: the halo blu•stone™ bathtub ($7,890) used by Christian Grey in the movie version of EL James’s bestselling “Fifty Shades of Grey.”
Based on the book by E.L. James, "Fifty Shades of Grey" features Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan. Dornan replaces Charlie Hunnam as the lead actor in the film. Hunnam stepped down for “scheduling” reasons after a Change.org petition demanding he be replaced garnered 87,000 signatures. (Universal Studios)
(Stop — stop, stop! — at 2:11.)
Blu Bathworks director of marketing Paula Coen tells me that the halo tub “features varying sloped sides for bathing comfort, allowing the bather to extend out or sit more upright.” Like Anastasia, this eco-friendly material is “visually luminous and soft — almost warm — to the touch.” It’s also highly durable and scratch resistant, which is especially handy if you’re bathing in handcuffs.
Coen, who has read the first two “Fifty Shades” books, says, “A man like Christian Grey would appreciate such a tub for its clean, minimalist design aesthetic. And of course, his choice of tub must accommodate two people, so the halo bathtub is ideal!”
Laters, Santa.

Fatmi slams Modi govt over Sanskrit row; mocks BJP over freedom struggle roleNirbhaya Fund still remains unspent : Aam Aadmi Party
Sanskrit should not be promoted at the cost of other regional languages, said former HRD minister M A A Fatmi, who also accused the Narendra Modi-led government’s education policy as ‘backward and insular’.
“It is a welcome step that the government has decided to promote Sanskrit but this should not be done hastily at the cost of other regional languages,” Former Union HRD Minister of State M A A Fatmi said today.
“We will support the government if it opens Sanskrit schools, colleges and universities at suitable places all over the country. However, if the government goes ahead with its policy of making Sanskrit compulsory as it is doing in the case of Kendriya Vidyalayas, it would only lead to resistance amongst students,” former RJD’s National General Secretary said.
Fatmi also accused the Bharatiya Janata Party-led (BJP) government at the Centre of following a backward and insular education policy.
“Modi had claimed that he would take the country forward into the 21st century by following a progressive policy in the vital field of education. Unfortunately, however, the very opposite is taking place,” Fatmi told reporters here.
“What we are seeing is that instead of inducting the best and the brightest educationists, the present government is hastily filling all vital posts with men belonging to the RSS, who carry out outdated ideas,” he claimed.
“Another very alarming move is that of trying to encroach up on the autonomy of important centres of higher education, including the Aligarh Muslim University. The subtle manner in which the BJP tried to use the issue of AMU central library and now the issue of freedom fighter Raja Mahendra Pratap, to needle the AMU, does not auger well,” he said.
Fatmi said,”if the government is really serious about honouring Raja Mahendra Pratap then I would strongly recommend that the government should honour him and his closest associate Maulana Barkatullah Khan with the Bharat Ratna. I can safely say that both of them deserve it. This would be better than trying to use communalism and casteism for polarizing society merely for political gains.”
“The BJP is a party without icons and one-by-one they are trying to appropriate secular icons like Raja Mahendra Pratap who had nothing to do with the BJP’s communal agenda. Raja Mahendra Pratap had always opposed the Jana Sangh tooth and nail. They do not have a single leader worth the name who took part in the national movement for freedom of the country,” he alleged.

Sun-Ranbaxy deal: CCI nod with brand dilution condition likely this weekSun-Ranbaxy deal: CCI nod likely this week with brand dilution rider
BS Reporter | New Delhi Dec 02, 2014 12:49 AM IST
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) is expected to come out with its decision on the merger of Sun Pharma and Ranbaxy this week.
CCI officials had earlier indicated a decision was likely by the end of November. It has been delayed, triggering apprehension over the deal facing a hurdle. However, sources said a conditional nod was on its way.
Regulatory approval is yet to come from the US Federal Trade Commission, too, for the $4 billion merger, the biggest deal in the pharmaceuticals industry in the Asia Pacific this year.
In the backdrop of speculation on the possibility of competition watchdog rejecting the merger deal, Sun Pharma came out with a statement late evening. Sun spokesperson said the company had neither received any final order from Competition Commission of India (CCI) on the transaction, nor had there been any rejection of the deal.
“CCI has been seeking additional information and detailed clarifications with respect to specific aspects of the products for the purpose of making its assessment. We see the process nearing its logical closure,’’ the Sun spokesperson said. He added that the company was happy with the open and transparent manner in which the matter had progressed. ‘’It is our intent to fully comply with all the regulatory requirements as required to close the transaction.”    
CCI chairman Ashok Chawla was not available for comments. Sun Pharma has  indicated the merger process could spill over to 2015.
“I think, some structural remedies might be offered to both the companies by the CCI since there could be some overlap between Sun Pharma and Ranbaxy. They would need to address that," said Amitabh Kumar of J Sagar Associates. One of the companies or both may be told to sell some of their brands so that the deal is not deemed monopolistic.
CCI gives its decision within 210 days of a case landing up at its door.
“Till date, clearances have been obtained from stock exchanges in India, from shareholders and competition authorities in all applicable markets, excluding India and USA. We are expecting to have the pending approvals by December 2014, but there could be minor delays if the approvals do not come by the end of December 2014,” Sun Pharma’s management had said after announcing last quarter’s results.
The Foreign Investment Promotion Board has approved the merger, following which the Ranbaxy and Sun Pharma scrips rose on BSE on Monday. After close of trading, Sun Pharma settled at Rs 835.25, down 0.5 per cent, while Ranbaxy settled 0.7 per cent higher at Rs 616.9.
The deal announced in April is a rare purchase of a local rival by a leading Indian drug company.The buyout is valued at $3.2 billion, but Sun Pharma will also acquire Ranbaxy’s debt of around $800 million, taking the transaction to $4 billion.
Both companies are likely to be advised to sell some of their businesses or brands before CCI approves their merger. It has written to Ranbaxy and Sun Pharma suggesting changes to get the deal going. CCI  began public scrutiny of the deal on August 27, following concerns that the presence of the two companies in key drug segments could lead to monopoly pricing. Consumer forums have argued the merger could stifle competition.
Industry analysts said there was likely to be significant overlap in Ranbaxy's and Sun Pharma's anti-infective and gastro-intestinal drug businesses. Market shares would also be affected in other therapeutic segments like cardiology, analgesics, respiratory, neurology, the central nervous system and gynaecology.
Sun Pharma-Ranbaxy’s combined annual revenue is estimated at $4.2 billion. Around $1.1 billion of that comes from sales in India. Once the deal is done, Sun Pharma will be the largest drug maker in the country with a market share of 9.2 per cent. The merger will create the fifth largest generic drug company in the world.
Sun Pharma will also acquire Ranbaxy's assets in India and in other countries. These include Ranbaxy's factories at Paonta Sahib (Himachal Pradesh), Dewas (Madhya Pradesh), Mohali and Toansa (Punjab) that were earlier supplying drugs to the US.

US intelligence agencies likely to question ISIS return youth
7
0
New Delhi: Sleuths of US intelligence agencies are likely to question Arif Majeed, who returned home after being associated with ISIS in Iraq and Syria, as he is believed to have loads of information about the group running a reign of terror in the region.
Official sources said the US, which is fighting a battle against ISIS, is keen to know about activities of the terrorist group and Arif could give inputs about the ground situation in the territory the outfit holds on.
Arif has told interrogators that even though he was a civil engineer, he was deployed to work in Mosul dam as a mason following instructions from some ISIS leaders. He was injured while working at the dam following an aerial attack, the sources said.
The US air strikes assisted the Kurdish and Iraqi army.
#isis #iraq #syria #us
The dam is the largest in Iraq and located on the Tigris river. For several weeks in July and August, ISIS held Mosul dam. On August 17, the Kurdish and Iraqi military launched a successful operation to retake control of the dam from ISIS.
The US air strikes assisted the Kurdish and Iraqi army. After his stint at the Mosul dam, Arif had moved to Rakka or ar-Raqqah, a Syrian town located on the north bank of the Euphrates river, which is now under the control of ISIS.
At Rakka, Arif was given an AK-47 rifle but soon he was injured for the second time due to splinter fire. During interrogation, Arif has said that apart from him and three other Mumbai youth, he had met one more Indian- origin youth who joined the ISIS.
That youth had come from one of the Gulf countries, the sources said.

The chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Monday gave the nod for the Rs. 775 crore railway line project which connects Jaigad Port with Konkan Railway through a public and private partnership to boost infrastructure and industries in Raigad district of Maharashtra.
The chief minister signed a memorandum of understanding with the Jaigad Port Company Private Limited and Konkan Railway for the 34 km railway tracks with the total cost of Rs 775.
Fadnavis said, “The port development will not only boost the trade but also go a long way in development of the infrastructure in the region. It would also provide new opportunities to the locals in employment.”
The state and centre are working in tandem to promote the developments of ports through PPP model in Maharashtra. At present the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) is already overloaded. The state government reckons there is a need to provide alternative to decongest the existing ports.
The project which is expected to complete in 24 months will boost the port activities and develop infrastructure in the Konkan region. The
chief minister said, “ The railway connectivity with the Jaigad Port will boost the import and export of goods which often is languishing
for months in absence of connectivity.” The stake holders in the project are Konkan Railways (26% equity), Maritime Board (11% ) and Jaigad Port Pvt Limited (63%).
Another multi-purposes project worth Rs 1000 crore Karanja Port Terminal in district Raigad was also launched on Monday. The project
which is also being promoted through public private partnership between Karanja Terminal and Logistic Pvt Limited and Maritime Board
is expected to complete in two years.

Southampton look to bounce back against Arsenal after Manchester City lossBy: Reuters | London |
Posted: December 1, 2014 8:38 pm
A 3-0 reality check at the hands of Manchester City was always a moment waiting to happen for Southampton. Just how they bounce back from Sunday’s defeat may now determine their fortunes this season.
Clues to the answer could come as early as Wednesday with a trip to Arsenal in the Premier League.
“There is no time to be any more disappointed about one result,” Saints boss Ronald Koeman told reporters on Monday. “It was three points, and Wednesday is another one.
“It is the best way to have a good reaction. Train hard, work hard and show it on the pitch – we have the chance this Wednesday.”
Fans, commentators and critics alike broadly agree Koeman’s side are playing some of the country’s best soccer down on the south coast.
This term they have smashed eight goals past hapless Sunderland and remain the meanest defence in the top flight despite shipping three against the champions.
Even their most ardent supporters had long known, however, that their lofty position was due in no small part to an accommodating run of early fixtures.
The Arsenal game comes at the start of a six-week run in which Saints play both the Gunners and Manchester United twice as well as leaders Chelsea.
Burnley, Everton and Crystal Palace may offer some relative relief in that period, but these six weeks will provide the first real test of Southampton’s European ambitions.
It speaks volumes for Koeman, the staff at St Mary’s and Southampton’s players that European football is even a topic of conversation after a summer of high-profile departures that had the Saints’ installed as bookmakers’ favourites for the drop.
Sitting third, with 26 points from 13 games, how Southampton respond to what was a first home defeat will offer an insight into their ambitions.
Skipper Jose Fonte insists Arsenal are now in the cross-hairs as the Saints looks to bounce back immediately.
“We have to. There’s no time to think about negatives and losing. There’s no time. This is football,” he told reporters.
“Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. We lost against the champions. Obviously, we are not happy but there’s no time to think about what-ifs or stuff like that – it’s just focus on the next one.”
Southampton will be without French international playmaker Morgan Schneiderlin who is out with a thigh injury.

Thierry Henry is leaving the New York Red Bulls after more than four seasons with Major League Soccer.
He made the announcement Monday, two days after the Red Bulls lost the Eastern Conference final to the New England Revolution.
The 37-year-old French star says he intended to leave the Red Bulls after his contract ended. He did not indicate if he’s retiring and plans to take a few weeks to decide what to do next.
There have been reports he wants to finish his career in Europe, where he one of the game’s most dominant players in his prime.

Police arrest constable for abetting suicide of colleagueBy: Express News Service | Vadodara |
Posted: December 1, 2014 8:26 pm | Updated: December 1, 2014 8:58 pm
Almost five days after an FIR was registered in the mysterious death of a lady  constable in Rajpipla, the Local Crime Branch of the Narmada Police arrested constable Vijaysinh Deepsinh from the outskirts of Ahmedabad city. According to the police, Vijaysinh had been evading arrest ever since an FIR was lodged against him for the abetment of suicide of lady constable Vasanti Vasava.
On Monday evening, shortly after 4 pm, the Local Crime Branch of the Narmada Police arrested Vijaysinh from the outskirts of Ahmedabad, five days after an FIR was lodged against him by Vasanti’s family, for sexual harassment and intimidation. Narmada police said that Vijaysinh had been on a leave since over two weeks to prepare for a competitive exam to become a Police Sub-Inspector, after which, he was evading the imminent arrest.
Vijaysinh’s wife, who has also been named in the FIR, had applied for anticipatory bail in the local court in Narmada, which was rejected on Monday. Although the police have not yet arrested Vijaysinh’s wife, Narmada Superintendent of Police Jaipalsinh Rathod said that they would take a call on her arrest after the probe.
According to Rathod, Vasanti and Vijaysinh had been involved in a relationship “without a future”, leading to her breakdown and eventual suicide. Rathod said, “The primary cause of Vasanti’s death is due to hanging. It is a simple case of suicide. There is no murder. We have found out that the two were involved in a relationship.
Since Vijaysinh is a married man with two children, the relationship between Vasanti and him had no future. She had developed an emotional attachment for him and this could have driven her to suicide. We are analyzing the detailed call records of both Vasanti and Vijaysinh to establish this. We have booked him for abetment of suicide in the FIR and not for murder.”
Vasanti’s family has rubbished Rathod’s statement about a “love affair” and maintained that Vijaysinh has murdered Vasanti as she had refused to allow him to sexually exploit her, blaming the police for “covering up” the murder. On Monday, Vasanti’s brother Raghuvir expressed disappointment that the police were trying to “tarnish the image” of his departed sister.
Raghuvir said, “Now that she is gone, they will say that she had an affair with Vijaysinh and killed herself in frustration. It is a blatant lie. My sister had told me about Vijaysinh’s indecent advances on a number of occasions.
“She had no affair with him. Even when her body was found, the police took my naive, illiterate father to sign the case papers calling it a suicide, without showing me the so called suicide note, although I was present there.”
Raghuvir has alleged that the senior officers were trying to shield Vijaysinh as he was the “secret keeper” of the officers and was in-line to be promoted to a PSI. Rathod, however, dismissed the family’s allegation about a cover up and said,  “For the last three days, we were searching for him. We sent our teams to the outskirts of continued…

NEW YORK — Ever wonder why a pair of reasonably decent eyeglass frames costs $250 or more while a pair of sunglasses of similar quality — complete with lenses — costs a fraction of that?
Or why high-end shopping areas and upscale malls across the nation are peppered with eyeglass stores?
Two words: huge profits.
That thinking — and the loss of a pair of glasses — was the genesis of Warby Parker, the online-based retailer that has exploded into the marketplace by selling stylish $95 frames complete with lenses.
"The technology behind a pair of glasses is 800 years old," says co-CEO Dave Gilboa at the company's headquarters in New York City's trendy SoHo neighborhood.  "And it's kind of crazy you can buy a new iPhone for less than it costs to buy a pair of glasses."
Gilboa points to a virtual monopoly in the industry as the reason for high prices. "We thought it was kind of wacky how expensive glasses were," he says. "I lost my only pair of glasses while backpacking around Southeast Asia that had cost me $700. And I showed up at school without a pair of glasses … because it was hard for me to justify paying that much for a new pair."
Warby Parker is one of 10 finalists in USA TODAY's Entrepreneur of the Year contest. Profiles of the final contender will run this week, and a winner will be selected in December.
The enterprise — which started in 2010 when four graduates of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania started selling glasses online from a Philadelphia apartment — has sold more than a million pairs. It  has given the same number to charity as part of its "Buy a Pair, Give a Pair" program that benefits sight-impaired people in developing nations.
Tech stocks: Luxottica shares up off Google Glass deal
This has been a particularly big year for the company. The bricks-and-mortar operation has rapidly expanded from four stores to nine across the USA, and two more will launch in the next few months.
Part of the growth comes outside New York City, where most of the company's 400-plus employees are located. In September, Warby Parker announced the opening of corporate offices in Nashville, aiming to create about 250 jobs over the next five years. The retail stores  operate coast to coast.
Another growth area: This year, the company  introduced glasses with progressive lenses, priced at $295. "That makes up about 50% of the market in the U.S. that we hadn't been addressing," says Gilboa. who runs the company with co-CEO and fellow Wharton graduate Neil Blumenthal. (The other founders are involved in their own ventures, though they remain on the Warby Parker board.)
Overall sales — Gilboa says the vast majority of revenue is generated online — are growing at warp speed, aided by the firm's "Home Try-On" service that sends potential customers five pairs of glasses to try out for free, return postage paid. The privately held company doesn't disclose revenue, but Gilboa says June's announcement of a million glasses given away is an accurate indicator of sales. In July 2013, that figure was 500,000.
Warby Parker, named after two Jack Kerouac characters, Warby Pepper and Zack Parker, has done it all based on a four-pronged strategy: low prices, stylish glasses, social responsibility and customer service.
Wendy Liebmann of WSL Strategic Retail, a New York City-based industry analyst and consultant, says  a key to success is that the firm has not been just a low-price competitor. "They discovered a problem, and they found a solution that wasn't the typical solution," Liebmann says, alluding to  the company's emphasis on style and customer service.

She compares Warby Parker to Zappos, the online footwear retailer. "Nobody thought you could sell shoes without trying them on."
Zappos has certainly been an inspiration to Blumenthal and Gilboa, who mentions chats with Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh as key in focusing the company.
Gilboa's advice to new entrepreneurs: "Put customers first and … really focus on customer experience. We still to this day find that the majority of our customers learn about Warby Parker through word of mouth, through great experiences that other customers have had."
He  advises against skimping on essentials. "We outsourced all our technology from the get-go and quickly realized that it was a massive mistake. If you want to be the most innovative brand and company … that has to start with technology."

Low Energy Nuclear Reactions: Papers and Patentsreddit
Introduction
The world community is truly at a crossroads like never before faced in the history of our civilization. If we continue business-as-usual with the consumption of fossil fuels, then, according to the 2014 edition of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)'s climate change report, grave consequences will almost surely ensue, including rising sea levels, extreme temperatures, flooding, drought, agricultural losses and, quite likely, violent conflicts among human societies. Delays may have already cost the world society USD$8 trillion .
Some who distrust the scientific consensus on climate change have taken heart at an apparent leveling off of world temperatures in the past few years. But it is now clear that this respite is short-lived, since 2014 is on track to be the hottest year on record .
On 12 November 2014, China and the U.S. reached a historic agreement to limit greenhouse gases. Other nations will hopefully follow suit. But even these cuts may not be enough . So how are we going to meet these goals?
Substantial progress has been achieved in photovoltaic (solar panel) technology, and also in wind energy. But these sources cannot be the ultimate answer, since they depend on vagaries of weather and geography. Thus the world community badly needs some other industrial-scale green energy source that is relatively safe and clean.
Fusion energy
Nuclear fusion , the energy that powers the sun and stars, is certainly an attractive option, since the fuel (ordinary water) is free, and it produces neither greenhouse gases nor long-lived radioactive waste.
The problem is that nuclear fusion normally only occurs at extremely high temperatures (millions of degrees). Scientists have been working on taming fusion for decades. The two most common research approaches are tokamak reactors , in which the reaction chamber is shaped like a torus and the nuclear material is heated and confined by magnetic force; and inertial confinement reactors , in which an array of high-powered lasers aimed at a small pellet of hydrogen isotopes heats it, in a tiny fraction of a second, to millions of degrees and initiates nuclear reactions. Billions of dollars have been spent on developing both of these schemes, mostly by large government-funded laboratories, but even the leaders of these projects acknowledge that we are decades away from commercial realization.
In October 2014, U.S. aerospace company Lockheed Martin announced a "technological breakthrough" in developing power based on nuclear fusion, using a magnetic confinement device of a different design than the tokamak. The firm's current target is to build a 100-megawatt nuclear fusion reactor only about 2 meters by 3 meters (seven feet by 10 feet) in size, within five years. These dimensions are smaller by a factor of ten than the ITER prototype reactor under construction in France by an international government-funded collaboration. Sadly, few details are available, so experts in the field are generally very skeptical that it will work. See our earlier Huffington Post article for additional details.
Low energy nuclear reactions (LENR)
In March 1989, Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons of the University of Utah announced, in a hastily convened press conference, that they had achieved nuclear fusion (dubbed cold fusion ) in a simple tabletop apparatus. But after numerous other research teams failed to replicate their experimental results, and after theoreticians argued that the claimed effects seemingly violated well-known principles of physical theory, Fleischmann and Pons were disgraced, and the episode became a textbook case of bad science. One scientist termed it the scientific fiasco of the [20th] century . Similarly, Time magazine listed "cold fusion" as one of the 100 worst ideas of the [20th] century .
But a funny thing happened on the way to the Fleischmann-Pons public hanging. Although the majority of researchers failed to reproduce the claimed anomalous heating effect, a few did observe this, at least in some experimental runs. A small community of researchers have pursued this research (now known as low-energy nuclear reactions or LENR) to the present day, with over 150 peer-reviewed papers reporting excess heating in similar experiments. At the request of some of these researchers, in 2004 the U.S. Department of Energy convened a review panel to consider the more recent evidence, but it concluded that LENR was not yet persuasive enough to initiate a new research program.
In the past few years, activity in the LENR arena has picked up considerably, with over 20 organizations involved, ranging from universities, national laboratories and NASA to corporations such as Mitsubishi and Toyota . Notables such as Bill Gates and former U.S. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu have expressed interest. Here are two particularly interesting developments:
Brillouin Energy
Researchers at Brillouin Energy Corp. of Berkeley, California are developing what they term a controlled electron capture reaction (CECR) process. In their experiments, ordinary hydrogen is loaded into a nickel lattice, and then an electronic pulse is passed through the system, using a proprietary control system. They claim that their device converts H-1 (ordinary hydrogen) to H-2 (deuterium), then to H-3 (tritium) and H-4 (quatrium), which then decays to He-4 and releases energy.
In one paper on their website , the Brillouin researchers found that "excess heat is always seen" when tuned pulses are present. They report being able to obtain excess heat using ordinary water with hydrided nickel, palladium or copper. In a second paper , the researchers assert that the excess heat is "measurable and repeatable."
Additional technical details are given in a Powerpoint presentation , a report summarizing their "quantum reaction hypothesis," and in a patent application . Their patent application reads, in part, "Embodiments generate thermal energy by neutron generation, neutron capture and subsequent transport of excess binding energy as useful heat for any application."
Andrea Rossi
In 2011, Andrea Rossi, an Italian entrepreneur with a somewhat checkered past, claimed that he and his research staff had developed a new LENR process, which they called the Energy Catalyzer or E-Cat for short. Their design consists of a ceramic or steel shell, to which a "fuel" consisting of hydrogen, lithium and nickel has been added to a sealed interior chamber. The apparatus is electrically heated from the outside to several hundred degrees Celsius. When this is done, according to Rossi and his research associates, the device produces significantly more heat energy than was input, much more than can be explained by ordinary chemical reactions, and, surprisingly, emits no significant radiation and produces no radioactive byproducts.
In May 2013, a team of Italian and Swedish scientists (not including Rossi) released a technical paper describing an experimental analysis of the E-Cat system. This attracted significant attention, although some  criticism as well.
In October 2014, the same team of Italian and Swedish researchers released a new paper, entitled Observation of abundant heat production from a reactor device and of isotopic changes in the fuel . This paper describes a much more sophisticated experiment, with better equipment. It claims substantial power output, with a "coefficient of performance" (ratio of output heat to input power) of up to 3.6. The experiment was performed at an independent laboratory in Lugano, Switzerland.
As we mentioned in a previous Huffington Post article , the most intriguing results in the 2014 Lugano paper are the before-and-after analyses of the "fuel," which found an "isotopic shift" had occurred in this material. In particular, the team found that lithium-7 had changed into lithium-6, and that nickel-58 and nickel-60 had changed to nickel-62. Here, for example, are the results from the Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry analysis:

It’s Cyber Monday — the day you’re supposed to be clicking and shopping. But you couldn’t tell from the faces of investors in many retail stocks today.
The SPDR S&P Retail exchange-traded fund, a basket of dozens of big retailers’ shares, is down $0.75, or 0.8%, to $92.71 Monday on widespread reports that Black Friday wasn’t as robust as investors hoped. And now with Cyber Monday kicking off — investors are wondering if this biggest day for online shopping might not measure up.
Eyes are closely affixed on online shopping leader Amazon.com (AMZN) , which so far is up $1.03, or 0.3% to $334.64 today. Seeing the industry leader up gives investors hope that retailers might be able to pull it out.
But overall, retail is not a great sector today which is disappointing coming off of Black Friday and going into Cyber Monday. The biggest retail stock loser among the broad Russell 1000 index Monday is struggling department store J.C. Penney (JCP) . Shares are down 2.4%. And rival Kohl’s (KSS) isn’t doing much better, falling 1.7%.
If there’s any big bright sign it’s Wal-Mart, which by all signs is faring well so far during the holiday season. Shares are up $1.26, or 1.5%, to $86.25.

New Delhi: A substantial part of a catholic church in northeast Delhi's Tahirpur area was gutted when a fire broke out at its premises on Monday morning with the Christian community suspecting foul play in the incident.
Police have registered a case under section 436 IPC (Mischief) on the complaint of the church authorities.
"Samples have been picked up from the spot by the Fire Department and an FSL team. We are waiting for a report by them to ascertain the cause of fire. We have received a complaint in this regard following which we have registered an FIR and further investigations are underway," said a senior police official on condition of anonymity.

#delhi #church #tahirpur #church fire
The blaze broke out at around 6:30 AM at St Sebastian's Church following which the security guard informed Father Antony Francis, the pastor of the church who then called Fire Birgade.
"We received a call around 7:25 AM about a blaze in the furniture. Four fire tenders were rushed to the spot which controlled the blaze by 8:30 AM," said a Fire department official.
"The sanctuary, sacristy and the first floor balcony of the church is completely gutted. It seems to be a deliberate act as we could smell kerosene on the spot," said Father Stanley Kozhichira, media director of Delhi archdiocese.
Other religious leaders of the community termed the incident the handiwork of "anti-social" elements.
"It has been by anti-social elements. We are not blaming any particular group for the act but it has been done by anti-social elements. It looks to me a case of sabotage and not of short-circuit as the fuse box was completely intact," said Father Suresh.
Following the incident, a large number of people from the community gathered outside the church and prayed for peace and better sense. People were seen crying looking at the burnt remains. They later moved to the local police station where they staged a sit in and moved only after senior officials ensured speedy investigation.
A number of politicians also reached the spot and took stock of the situation.

Obama holding day of meetings focused on mistrust of law enforcementBy Greg Jaffe December 1 Follow @GregJaffe
President Obama is holding a day of meetings Monday focused on the growing mistrust between law enforcement and minority groups in the wake of last week’s grand jury decision to not indict a police officer for fatally shooting an unarmed black teenager Ferguson, Missouri in August.
Obama has been reluctant to criticize the grand jury’s decision not to indict former Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of Michael Brown, saying “we need to accept that this decision was the grand jury’s to make.” But he has also said that that the unrest was evidence of the “deep distrust [that] exists between law enforcement and communities of color.”
Monday’s meetings will focus on the broader issues that might be feeding that mistrust to include the sale of mothballed military equipment to local law enforcement agencies. The president will also speak with elected officials, young civil rights leaders and religious leaders.
“As the country has witnessed, disintegration of trust between law enforcement agencies and the people they protect and serve can destabilize communities, undermine the legitimacy of the criminal justice system, undermine public safety, create resentment in local communities, and make the job of delivering police services less safe and more difficult,” a White House official said.
The president will also convene his cabinet to discuss a review, initiated in August, that examined the sale of hulking armored vehicles, military grade body armor, rifles and helicopters to police and sheriff’s departments around the country. The heavily armed response by police in Ferguson this summer shocked many Americans and was widely cited as contributing to the unrest there.
The president’s meetings will also delve into longer-standing issues, such as a long history of racial discrimination, that have fostered mistrust between minorities and law enforcement officers. Obama referred to some of these tensions in the wake of last week’s grand jury verdict. “We have made enormous progress in race relations over the course of the past several decades,” he said. “But what is also true is that there are still problems and communities of color aren’t just making these problems up.”

Fewer than a dozen governors have won four full four-year terms. Three are currently in office.Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad is America’s longest-serving governor, having been elected to his sixth four-year term last month. (Charlie Neibergall/AP)
The reign of the four-term governor is a relatively new phenomena.
Govs. Jerry Brown (D-Calif.) and John Kitzhaber (D-Ore.) last month became the 10th and 11th governors in U.S. history to be elected to four full four-year terms. They joined a handful of men all of whom got on that list within the past half-century, according to Eric Ostermeier, a research associate at the University of Minnesota’s Humphrey School of Public Affairs who writes the Smart Politics blog . Current Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad (R) is also on the list, having been elected to his sixth four-year term last month.
The first governor to join that short list was New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller (R), who won his fourth four-year term in 1970, though he would resign just over a year before that term ended. Ohio’s Jim Rhodes (R) was next, winning his fourth (non-consecutive) term in 1978. The remaining men on that short list are: Alabama’s George Wallace (D), who won his fourth term in 1982; Idaho’s Cecil Andrus (D), who won in 1990; Louisiana’s Edwin Edwards (D), who won in 1991; North Carolina’s Jim Hunt (D), who won in 1996; and South Dakota’s Bill Janklow (R) and Wisconsin’s Tommy Thompson (R), who both secured their spot on the list in 1998.
If Kitzhaber completes the term he was elected to in November, he will claim the second spot on the list of longest-serving governors, behind Iowa’s Branstad. Brown would become the fourth, behind South Dakota’s Janklow.
Three dozen states impose gubernatorial term limits. In California, Brown has been able to win election to four terms because he served two before the state enacted a two-term limit in 1990.

CHUCK TODD: Why didn’t you?
REP. TOM COTTON: Well, there weren’t the votes in the House going forward to focus on the real problems that the people of Arkansas shared with me during the campaign. A bill that focused on building a border fence or enforcing our interior immigration laws, and getting a handle on legal immigration, that could actually drive down wages and increase unemployment. But I think the new Congress will focus on those priorities.
CHUCK TODD: You had said immigration, you felt, was the number-one issue. The reason why you and so many Republicans won. Do you believe that?
REP. TOM COTTON: Well, certainly, a central issue in the campaign, along with Obamacare and national security. But too many Arkansans are worried about the impact that rampant illegal immigration is having on their communities and local services, on the impact it’s having on jobs for working families all across the country. And that’s why they want us to address those problems in the new Congress.
CHUCK TODD: Now, you brought up one other issue during the campaign. I want to ask you about it. Let me play some audio from you about the immigration issue.
REP. TOM COTTON (ON TAPE): First off, we have a lot at stake to collaborate with drug cartels in Mexico that have clearly shown their ready to expand outside the drug trade into human trafficking and potentially even terrorism. They could infiltrate our defenseless southern border and attack it right here in places like Arkansas.
CHUCK TODD: You didn’t bring up terrorism just now with me. You did in a campaign phone call. Is that just campaign rhetoric?
REP. TOM COTTON: No. I mean, Hezbollah–
CHUCK TODD: What’s the evidence?
REP. TOM COTTON: No, Hezbollah has tried to launch terrorist attacks right here in Washington D.C. They’re under federal indictment collaborating with locals in Mexico to cross our borders, attack us here. As long as our border is open and it’s defenseless, then it’s not just an immigration issue, it’s a national security issue. And we know that these drug cartels in Mexico are focused primarily on power and profit. They’ll branch out into any activity if it brings them more money and helps them consolidate control. That’s yet another reason why we have to get control of our border.
CHUCK TODD: Do you worry that rhetoric like that ends up making it even that much harder to actually get some sort of agreeable immigration bill?
REP. TOM COTTON: No.
CHUCK TODD: Because that plays to fear. That’s, you know, some would argue that’s fear mongering.
REP. TOM COTTON: Well, the Islamic State is cutting the heads off of Americans right now. And their leader has said they want to strike us here in the United States. That’s something that we should be fearful of and that we should take a strong stance against, whether it’s in Iraq, in Syria, or whether it’s securing our southern border.
Plainly, Todd had his talking point — talk of terrorism is fear-mongering — and no explanation would suffice. But Cotton with a swift “no” dismissed the accusation of fear-mongering and had a specific explanation for his justification for concern about Hezbollah, something Todd plainly had not anticipated. Todd’s second talking point — Republicans don’t want immigration reform — also fell flat when Cotton insisted he wanted reform.
Republicans can learn a thing or two from the exchange. Don’t be rude. Keep smiling. Have your facts. “No” is a complete sentence. And never, ever accept the false premise for a question. Whether deliberately or not, the liberal media operate on a set of inherently hostile assumptions about Republicans, but alas, they are rarely prepared to meet an able opponent. In the 2016 debates, Republicans would be wise not to shield their candidates from hostile mainstream media hosts; they are a fact of life for conservatives. And much can be learned from how a Republican rises to the challenge.

Dulles Airports troubles in one handy graphicBy Lori Aratani December 1 Follow @loriara
Dulles Airport is in trouble — as we explained in this article last week. Passenger traffic is down significantly, and perhaps most telling, more people are expected to fly through Reagan National Airport than Dulles in 2015. Pretty remarkable considering Dulles is 14 times the size of National.
We know some of our readers are visual, so take a look at these graphics and you can see the passenger trends for yourself.
Our story generated a lot of comments, from people who fiercely defended Dulles to those who say they’re rather drive anywhere but Dulles . (One gentleman who lives in Maryland said he’s rather drive to Philadelphia than to Dulles even though it takes him 30 minutes longer). We recognize, however, that his case may be extreme. But it is clear from the flood of e-mails we received  that some folks will go through extremes to avoid Dulles.
Still others said it’s all about the airfares — Dulles is just too darned expensive. Baltimore Washington International  Marshall Airport is the most popular airport and many credit the presence of Southwest Airlines for making it the airport of choice in the D.C. region. More than 70 percent of the flights at BWI are operated by Southwest.

Gulls have a habit of flaying whales alive  but the whales are fighting backBy Rachel Feltman December 1 Follow @rachelfeltman
Having a whale of a time. (Dennis Drenner for The Washington Post)
Today in horrific things you might not know about the natural world: In the 1970s, researchers observed that Argentinian kelp gulls had begun to rip at the skin of living whales in order to feed on them .
And in recent years, recorded instances of this gull-on-whale violence have only gone up. By 2008, researchers were seeing gull-inflicted wounds -- tears, sometimes nearly 8 inches long and cutting down into blubbery fat, in their backs -- on 77 percent of the whales they found. Mother and calf pairs were targeted the most.
The gull populations have increased during that time, Ed Yong writes for National Geographic , and it's possible that the savaging birds have learned that surfacing whales are easy targets by watching other gulls dive in for snack time.
But according to new observations published in the journal Marine Biology, the whales may be learning new tricks to make their backs less of an all-you-can-eat buffet for the birds. From National Geographic :
Usually, when they come up for a breath, they do so in a leisurely way, lying parallel against the water surface with much of their backs exposed. But in 2009, [lead author Ana] Fazio’s team saw that a few of the whales would instead rise at a 45 degree angle so that only their heads were exposed, and only up to their blowhole. Their breaths were shorter and stronger than usual, and they quickly submerged again.
With this new technique, less of the back is exposed as the whale breathes -- and it seems to be most common among whales living in the area where gull attacks are also especially common. The use of the technique, which the researchers have dubbed "oblique breathing," has increased from 3 percent to 70 percent at that site in just three years, and is spreading to surrounding areas as well.
Unfortunately, it's an energy-intensive -- and counterintuitive -- method of breathing, so it may be tough for calves to learn successfully. Local officials are working to cut down on gull populations, which were probably bolstered by the use of open landfills , but calves in the region are still suffering unusually high mortality rates -- so the battle against the birds is far from over.

U.S. factory activity growth slows in November: ISMU.S. housing starts fall, but trend points to recovery
By Lucia Mutikani, Reuters
8
Groundbreaking declined 1.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.028 million units, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. October's starts were revised up to a pace of 1.045 million units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts rising to a rate of 1.04 million units from October's previously reported pace of 1.01 million units.
@jhanzel thanks for pointing that out in the summer of recovery part 6

Yields for U.S. Treasuries held at lower levels, while the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. U.S. stock futures were pointing to a lower open also as crude oil prices continued to drift lower. Housing continues to be stymied by tepid wage growth, which has been far outpaced by home price increases. Higher mortgage rates are also a constraint, although they have declined from a peak reached in September 2013.
The housing recovery also is being challenged by a very slow pace of household formation, as high unemployment among young adults is forcing many to either continue living at home with their parents or share quarters with friends or relatives.
Household formation is currently running at about 500,000 a year, far below the more than 1 million that would signal a strong housing market recovery.
But with job growth accelerating, wages are expected to pick up next year and pull in first-time buyers, especially young people, into the housing market, providing a tailwind for the economy. Housing has been a mild boost to gross domestic product so far this year.
"With labor market conditions continuing to be favorable ... we believe that it will be only a matter of time before the housing recovery shifts up a gear or two and provides a crucial second wind to the economic recovery," said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
Last month's drop in groundbreaking was concentrated in the single-family homes segment, the largest part of the market, which fell 5.4 percent to a 677,000-unit rate. Single-family starts had posted two straight months of hefty gains.
Starts for the volatile multi-family homes segment increased 6.7 percent to a 351,000-unit pace. The increase unwound some of October's 9.9 percent drop.
Multi-family starts continue to be driven by demand for rental units as many financially-strapped Americans shun home ownership.
Last month, permits dropped 5.2 percent to a pace of 1.035 million units after two straight months of gains. That was the biggest drop since January.
Permits, which lead starts by three to four months, have been above a pace of 1 million units since July.
Permits for single-family homes fell 1.2 percent to a 639,000-unit pace in November. Permits for multi-family housing tumbled 11 percent to a 396,000-unit pace. That followed two months of big increases.

Blackout of Bulls  Blackhawks for 342 000 Dish subscribers...Blackout of Bulls, Blackhawks for 342,000 Dish subscribers looming
Dish Network
Hey sports fans: There's no guarantee Dish will carry Bulls, Blackhawks starting next week.
Analyst says Dish is “done” with regional sports networks.
When the Chicago Bulls host the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday night, speculation will run rampant over how much injury-plagued superstar Derrick Rose will play.
Hundreds of thousands of Chicago-area Dish Network subscribers may have a bigger question: Where is the game?
Comcast SportsNet Chicago, which is carrying the game, is perhaps days from being blacked out by the satellite provider in a dispute over license fees. The current agreement expires Monday and Dish Network is balking at an increase demanded by CSN.
At stake is CSN Chicago's slate of Bulls, Blackhawks, White Sox and Cubs games and its other sports programming, a local fan staple for 10 years. Dish has more than 342,000 subscribers in the Chicago area who would be affected by such a blackout, according to media research firm SNL Kagan.
The dispute also involves CSN Mid-Atlantic (Washington and Baltimore area), CSN Bay Area (San Francisco-Oakland) and CSN California (Northern California and parts of Oregon and Nevada), all of which may be dropped by Dish next week.
The two sides appear to be at an impasse, with increasingly divergent positions being argued through the media as Monday's deadline for a deal approaches. CSN started an on-air campaign last week warning viewers of the looming blackout to enlist their support in negotiations with Dish. Tens of thousands of customers have expressed concern, according to executives.
Colorado-based Dish, which has 14 million satellite subscribers and a history of playing hardball with regional sports networks, seems unfazed by potential fan backlash.
@ChrisHinesTavolacci You just need a taller dish on your trailer...............

"Comcast SportsNet is demanding a 40 percent price increase for more than 90 percent of Dish customers in each of the affected markets, when only a small fraction of those consumers actually watch the channels," Dish said in a statement.
Sources familiar with the negotiations say NBCUniversal, which operates the regional sports networks after being acquired by Comcast last year, may be seeking closer to a 10 percent increase across the four markets.
"We are seeking to license our regional sports networks to Dish on the same terms that other distributors have accepted for this programming," NBCUniversal said in a statement. "Our rates are reflective of the very high value of this programming, a value that is recognized by consumers through the increased ratings for these (regional sports networks)."
Launched in 2004, CSN Chicago is a partnership among Comcast and the Bulls, Blackhawks, White Sox and Cubs. Comcast owns about 30 percent of the sports network, the teams control the rest. CSN Chicago has never been blacked out by a cable satellite provider.
Most of CSN Chicago's revenue comes from fees paid by cable and satellite providers including Comcast, RCN Cable, DirecTV and Dish Network. Advertising provides a secondary revenue stream.
Sports networks have traditionally garnered the highest license fees among cable networks. Live game broadcasts are perhaps the only DVR-proof programming, making sports content extremely valuable, according to industry analysts. ESPN tops all cable networks in affiliate revenue, getting average monthly fees of $6.04 per subscriber, according to SNL Kagan, with Turner Broadcasting's TNT, whose programming includes the NBA, a distant second at $1.44 per subscriber.
Regional sports networks also skew higher in affiliate revenue. CSN Chicago gets average monthly fees of $3.25 per subscriber, which ranks 11th among regional sports networks, according to SNL Kagan. CSN Mid-Atlantic ranks second at $4.60 per subscriber, while CSN Bay Area is fifth at $3.53 per subscriber.
There are signs that cable sports subscribers fees may be peaking. SportsNet LA, a regional sports network launched this year by Time Warner Cable and the Los Angeles Dodgers, was blacked out to nearly two-thirds of local viewers for the entire baseball season because other cable and satellite providers refused to pay a higher premium.
SportsNet LA gets an average monthly fee of $4.00 per subscriber, according to SNL Kagan.
Dish is the third-largest pay-TV provider in the U.S. behind Comcast and DirecTV. Comcast has more than 22 million subscribers, according to SNL Kagan.
Dish has been embroiled in several high-profile carriage disputes recently, dropping Turner Broadcasting's CNN and Turner Classic Movies in October, and threatening to black out TBS and TNT before reaching a short-term agreement last week to restore all of the channels while negotiations continued.
Dish avoided a similar blackout of CBS-owned stations with a short-term extension last week. On Tuesday, CBS issued a statement saying "a short-term extension into next week has been granted while negotiations continue."
Positioned as a value-priced service, Dish has shown a willingness to hold the line on cable network license fees, especially when dealing with regional sports networks. In August, Dish dropped CSN New England completely after a series of extensions failed to resolve a carriage dispute.
In 2010, Dish dropped the MSG Network from its lineup when no deal was reached after the expiration of their carriage agreement. MSG remains dark and Dish doesn't carry any of the four regional sports networks in New York.
"They've always been kind of the low-price multichannel service and I just think they believe there's a market there for packages that don't have the regional sports networks," said Derek Baine, a senior media analyst with SNL Kagan.
Baine said history suggests any blackout of CSN Chicago by Dish could be more than a temporary inconvenience for local sports fans.
"They've dropped quite a few (regional sports networks)," Baine said. "It's not a negotiating strategy. They're done with them."

Will Santa Claus bring the gift of profit to Wall Street in the form of a year-end December rally?
If prices at the gas pump remain low and consumers stay in a buying mood around the all-important holiday shopping season, there's a strong chance Santa will deliver gains this December, says Patty Edwards, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.
If oil prices don't go "significantly upward, the market has a bit of a tailwind," Edwards says. "Longer-term, the market will trade on earnings — which we view as still positive — more than emotion. But as long as the consumer remains in a good mood, it would appear to us that Santa Claus is indeed coming to town."
December has a reputation as an investor-friendly month. It benefits from its inclusion in the six-month seasonal sweet spot for stocks. December is the second month in what historically has been the stock market's best six-month period, a bullish stretch from the start of November to the end of April. In fact, the 12th month of the year is the second-best month for the Dow Jones industrial average in the past 50 years, according to Bespoke Investment Group. The Dow has gained 1.6% on average in December, posting gains nearly 70% of the time.

Stocks kick off December on a high note. The Standard & Poor's 500 index came off its sixth straight weekly gain, its first streak of that length since an eight-week run that ended in November 2013, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.
U.S. stocks have rallied sharply since a price pullback ended in mid-October. The gains have been powered by a strong third-quarter earnings season, an economy  growing faster than economists had forecast and coordinated stimulus programs by central bankers and policymakers in Japan, China and the eurozone that have offset the end of the Federal Reserve's bond-buying program in October.
The combination of seasonal strength, strong business fundamentals and valuations at or below long-term averages increases the odds that stocks can continue to rise into the year's end, perhaps as much as 2%, says Sam Stovall, U.S. equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ.
"In support of history, we think the S&P 500 should do well in December,"  Stovall says. "Our projection for solid November employment gains (when the results are released Dec. 5), our forecasts for improving holiday retail sales and the prospects for better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit growth should help maintain the market's upward momentum."
Regan: Stock rally not done because it's 'game on' for the Fed
Stocks might also get a boost from fund managers who are trailing their market benchmarks heading into the final month of the year and who could buy stocks more aggressively in an effort to catch up,  Stovall says. As late as mid-November, 73% of large-company value managers were "underperforming" the S&P 500 Value Index, and 94% of large-cap fund managers were trailing the S&P 500 Growth Index,  Stovall says.
The  "Santa Claus Rally"  is slightly different from a year-end rally, as it is more of a year-end phenomenon and can include all of December. The Stock Trader's Almanac coined the phrase "Santa Claus Rally," which refers to the performance of the stock market in "the last five trading days of the year and the first two sessions of the New Year," says Jeffrey Hirsch, the Almanac's editor.
Santa has delivered a rally over that stretch every year since 2009.
Santa Claus Rally gains average 1.5% over the seven-day period, according to Hirsch.
Hirsch expects a year-end-rally in December. "It's already underway," he says.
Working in the stock market's favor: a strong U.S. economy and healthy corporate America, still-low interest rates and the fact that the market has digested the end of the Fed's bond-buying program. Another plus: the fresh stimulus  pumped into markets in Europe, Japan and China will benefit the USA as cash flows into our market,  Hirsch says.
One caveat: All this upbeat market commentary has put stocks in an overbought position, increasing the risks going forward, says market strategist Brad Lamensdorf, the chief investment officer of the Lamensdorf Market Timing Report.
"The anticipated fourth-quarter bounce has come and gone, and the majority of gains have now been captured," Lamensdorf warns. "At this point, both the short- and long-term gauges are in overbought territory. Raising cash and hedging are recommended in such a high-risk environment."

How the Deep South turned red  animatedBy Philip Bump December 1 Follow @pbump
If Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) loses Saturday's run-off election -- as she is very likely to do -- the Deep South will not have a single governor, senator  or state legislature that is in Democratic hands.
That's not necessarily permanent, of course, but it at least marks the end result of a long-term trend in the region toward Republicans. It's been stop-and-start; once a Senate seat or governorship has gone from blue to red over the past 30 years, it has occasionally flipped back the other way. And, particularly as demographics in the South shift, Georgia might start shifting back in the other direction. This is likely a nadir for Democrats, not a final resting place.
Using data from the National Conference of State Legislatures , we created this animation to illustrate how control of the state house, governorships and seats in the U.S. Senate has evolved in the states of the Deep South since 1978. (The number of seats in the House of Representatives has similarly become more red, of course.)
If Landrieu manages to win the run-off, Louisiana will remain yellow, as it is currently, with a senator from each party. That will likely hold until at least 2020.

Powerful cold front kick-starts meteorological winter in central U.S.By Angela Fritz December 1 Follow @angelafritz

Monday marks the first day of meteorological winter, and a powerful cold front sweeping across the central U.S. is assuring that temperatures feel the part.
Temperatures took a nose dive over the weekend as cold, Canadian air pushed south. Through Monday morning, from Idaho to the Dakotas, the early December cold blast chilled temperatures to more than 40 degrees below average.
Around 10 p.m. on Saturday, the temperature spread in Wyoming was over 50 degrees — from zero in northwest Wyoming to 52 in the southeast.
Temperatures across the Lower 48 on Saturday. (NWS)
On Friday, Great Falls, Mont., reached a daytime high of 56 degrees around 2 p.m., but starting in the 3 p.m. hour, the temperature took a nose dive into negative territory. Sunday’s morning low bottomed out at minus 22 degrees — 78 degrees colder than it was just 40 hours earlier.
The temperature dropped over 70 degrees in Great Falls, Mont., between Friday and Sunday. This graph illustrates the nose dive that the temperature (red) took on Friday, Nov. 28, at a personal weather station on the south side of the city. ( Weather Underground )
Even across the Plains states, the temperature dove 40 to 60 degrees between Saturday and Sunday. O’Neill, Neb., saw a 24-hour temperature drop of 60 degrees, Valentine, Neb., dove 59 degrees, and even Guymon, Okla., decreased 45 degrees.
Sunday morning’s low of minus 22 degrees tying the record for the date in Great Falls, previously set in 1985. Bozeman Dillon Airport, and Holter Dam, all in Montana, also set record low temperatures for the date on Sunday.
Temperature change between Saturday and Sunday across the central U.S. ( weather.com )
Meanwhile, ahead of the front, temperatures were running as much as 20 degrees above average on Sunday night, from northeast Texas to southwest New York. The weekend’s Arctic blast is losing some of its punch as it pushes east, though. Eastern Seaboard highs on Tuesday could run 10 to 15 degrees below average, but will rebound as early as Wednesday into normal or even above normal territory.
Out west, things will thaw quickly this week as highs are expected to surge back into the 40s and 50s by Thursday.

Girl Scouts may now sell cookies online and ship them directly to your faceBy Abby Ohlheiser December 1 Follow @abbyohlheiser
Girl Scouts Bria and Shirell practice selling cookies on one of two new digital platforms. (Girl Scouts of the USA via AP)
The Girl Scouts of the United States of America added something new this week to a nearly 100-year-old tradition: Scouts will soon use the Internet to sell their cookies . And, crucially, they will ship those online orders directly to the buyers.
The cookie-selling program is designed to help troop members develop entrepreneurial skills — from setting goals and handling money to sharpening their sales and people skills — by selling and delivering the cookies themselves. The girls compete against each other, and with other troops, to sell the most cookies, with individual and troop-wide prizes available. Until now, that process has been strictly analog; online sales were banned by the organization.
Here’s how that will change: “Digital Cookie,” a platform recently approved by the organization, will allow Girl Scouts to sell cookies via a mobile and tablet app or a personal website starting in January. Troops have to opt-in to the online selling program for their cookie-selling drives.
The organization expects that as many as 1 million scouts — or about half of the girls who participate in the Girl Scouts — will use the online selling programs next year, the Associated Press reported .
But the new tools don’t allow Girl Scouts to simply set up a Web site, sit back and wait for the sales to come in. Each individual Girl Scout will have to initiate contact with a potential buyer; the personal cookie-selling sites are only accessible via emailed invitations. It’s a supplement, not a replacement, for the pen-and-paper spreadsheet sales that Girl Scouts (and their customers) know well.
The popular cookies sell for about $4 a box on average. Troop members traditionally make door-to-door sales (these days, with parents in tow), set up booths outside retail stores, or — controversially — send forms to their parents’ workplaces to sell as many cookies as possible. The online sales, the Girl Scouts hope, will become one of many strategies scouts use to learn about entrepreneurship

Occasionally, the national organization will step in and remind scouts — and their parents — that cookie sales are supposed to be educational endeavors. In 2012, the organization told the New York Times that it disapproves of parents selling cookies at work on behalf of their children. “Adults should not be selling cookies,” a representative told the paper. “We do want parents to help. We do not want parents to make the sale.”
That has also happened, in the past, with online sales. An 8-year-old named Wild Freeborn worked with her software-programmer dad in 2009 to set up an online sales portal for her own cookie drive — until the Girl Scouts stopped her, citing the ban.
Some local Girl Scout parents reportedly complained about Freeborn’s sales drive, which came complete with a promotional YouTube video.
At the time, the Girl Scouts told the “Today” show that the ban was in place until the organization could find a way to allow online sales in a manner that is “fair and equitable for all girls,” while remaining safe for the scouts.
Girl Scout cookie-selling began as early as 1917 in Oklahoma. Scouts used to bake their own cookies following a popular recipe, the organization explained; eventually, the program expanded to include the variety of cookies familiar to many today.
The record for sales in one season? It belongs to Katie Francis, an Oklahoma City Girl Scout who sold more than 21,000 boxes this year.

Max Boot on paying ransom  past and presentBy Eugene Volokh December 1 Follow @volokhc
An interesting Wall Street Journal op-ed by Max Boot (I’ve provided the Google search because that’s not covered by the Journal paywall). Boot notes that America has indeed paid ransom on various occasions in the past:
“No ransom for hostages” is a sound principle but one that has often been violated. The U.S. has paid ransom for hostages, with mixed results, since the early days of the republic.
But he concludes, I think persuasively, that this is not a wise approach:
It is regrettable, indeed infuriating, that so many U.S. allies pay ransom, which encourages more hostage-taking and more terrorism in general. The New York Times estimates that al Qaeda and its various affiliates earned more than $125 million from hostage-taking between 2008 and 2014. That makes kidnapping a major — perhaps the major — revenue stream for many of these groups. Paying ransom subsidizes violent extremists to make war on the rest of us.

White  Hispanic police officers disciplined for deadly Cleveland car chase sue city for discriminationBy Abby Phillip December 1 Follow @abbydphillip

Nearly two years to the day after Cleveland police officers fired on a vehicle during a high-speed car chase that left two unarmed African Americans dead, nine officers who were involved in that incident have filed a lawsuit claiming that the police department unfairly punished them because they were not black.
The lawsuit was filed Friday in U.S. District Court on behalf of eight white officers and one Hispanic officer. It names the city of Cleveland and members of the police department as defendants. In the suit, the nine officers claim that they were punished more harshly after the high-profile officer-involved shooting because of their race and the race of the two victims.
The Nov. 29, 2012, incident left driver 43-year-old Timothy Russell and a passenger, 30-year-old Malissa Williams, dead after a 20-plus-minute chase that involved 62 police cars and more than 100 officers who wrongly believed that occupants of the vehicle had fired a weapon at them.
More than a dozen officers fired 137 shots at the vehicle, striking Russell 23 times and Williams 24 times. No guns or shell casings were recovered from the 1979 Chevrolet Malibu that Russell was driving.
After the incident, the officers who filed the lawsuit were suspended with pay for three days and ordered to serve a 45-day “cooling off period” before they could return to active duty.
But the lawsuit alleges that the nine officers were denied opportunities for promotions and transfers to specialized units and did not return to active duty for 16 months. They were subjected to ” ‘unofficial punishment’ in violation of their constitutional rights” that resulted in permanent lost wages, lower earning capacity and damage to their reputations, according to the court filing.
The police department places “onerous burdens” on non-African American officers, according to the lawsuit, because of “their race and the race of persons who are the subjects of the legitimate use of deadly force.”
“All of the plaintiffs felt as though they had no other choice other than to discharge their firearms in order to deal with what they believe to be an imminent threat to their safety and the safety of other officers,” the lawsuit stated. “Additionally, other officers from the scene stated that they too felt deadly force was justified, despite not firing their own weapons.”
The victims’ families have said that the officers might have believed they were fired upon because the car backfired .
Daniel Williams, a spokesman for the city of Cleveland, said Monday morning that the mayor’s office does not yet have a response because it had not officially been served a lawsuit.
The fatal 2012 car chase prompted the U.S. Department of Justice to open a civil rights investigation into the Cleveland Police Department, based on allegations that its officers use excessive and “unreasonable deadly force.” The federal probe, launched in March 2013, is ongoing.
On Saturday, marking the second anniversary of the deaths of Russell and Williams, their families gathered for a vigil at the Heritage Middle School parking lot where the car chase came to an end.
They were joined by relatives of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old African American whose killing by a white police officer in a Cleveland park  Nov. 22 has garnered national attention.
Rice was playing with a toy replica of a semiautomatic weapon that officers believed was real. Video footage shows a Cleveland officer exiting a still-moving patrol car and firing on Rice moments after arriving on the scene.

“You’re at the start, where we were two years ago,” said Walter Jackson, Malissa Williams’s uncle, according to Cleveland.com . “You need to be strong. God is watching, and he’s going to bring you through the situation.”
The officers’ lawsuit comes at a time of heightened tension nationwide, touched off by the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., over the summer.
Brown, a 19-year-old African American, was killed by white police officer Darren Wilson. Conflicting accounts by eyewitnesses  say that Brown was either advancing aggressively toward the officer or  was surrendering with his hands up. Last week, a grand jury declined to indict Wilson, fueling more protests across the country .
Wilson resigned from the Ferguson Police Department over the weekend.
In the Cleveland case, the families of Russell and Williams reached a $3 million settlement with the city in July .
Patrolman Michael Brelo, who is not a plaintiff in the lawsuit, was indicted on charges of manslaughter. Prosecutors say that Brelo fired 49 shots into the vehicle, including 15 into the windshield from the hood of the car after it came to a stop, according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer .
Brelo has pleaded not guilty; if convicted, he faces up to 22 years in prison.
Five supervisors were charged with dereliction of duty for failing to manage the chase. And 63 officers were suspended for up to 10 days each for their roles in the chase.

Ashanti and DeSean Jackson celebrate at STKBy Helena Andrews December 1 Follow @helena_andrews
Hey isn’t that … The “aw baby” aficionado herself, singer Ashanti, having dinner with Redskins player DeSean Jackson at STK on Friday night? (At this point we think it’s safe to call STK the “Cheers” of Washington’s pro athlete class. Who hasn’t been?)
Our source says the celeb pair, a rumored couple for the past year, dined with about 20 friends. How intimate! The big celebration could have been for Jackson’s birthday. The wide receiver’s 28th birthday is Dec. 1. Ashanti, we’re told, came outfitted in a sleek black dress and matching fur. Jackson sported jeans and a black tee. Our tipster described the pair as “classy but casual.”
Ashanti split from her on-again, off-again boyfriend, rapper Nelly, in 2013. In an interview with Access Hollywood last year, Ashanti described herself as “super single” but did reveal that she gets “a lot of texts.” When asked the obvious next question — from who? – the singer said, “The last famous dude who texted me? DeSean Jackson.” Modern day matchmaking at its finest, people.

Chris Rock is right: White Americans are a lot less racist than they used to be.Actor Chris Rock poses backstage with his comedy film award for "Top Five" during the Hollywood Film Awards in Hollywood, California November 14, 2014. REUTERS/Danny Moloshok
Chris Rock wants you to stop talking about "black progress," and consider "white progress" instead.
In an interview with Frank Rich of Vulture , he says "to say that black people have made progress would be to say they deserve what happened to them before." He goes on:
So, to say Obama is progress is saying that he’s the first black person that is qualified to be president. That’s not black progress. That’s white progress. There’s been black people qualified to be president for hundreds of years... The question is, you know, my kids are smart, educated, beautiful, polite children. There have been smart, educated, beautiful, polite black children for hundreds of years. The advantage that my children have is that my children are encountering the nicest white people that America has ever produced. Let’s hope America keeps producing nicer white people.
Those last two sentences are at once sad, hilarious and quantifiably true. If Barack Obama had been born fifty years earlier, for instance, he would literally have had zero chance of becoming president - in 1958, only 38 percent of Americans said they would vote for a black presidential candidate , according to Gallup. By 2012, that number was 96 percent.
That 58 percentage point change didn't happen because blacks somehow became smarter and more qualified relative to whites during that period, but rather because many -- although by no means all -- white Americans abandoned the overt prejudices that kept talented blacks from getting ahead.
The General Social Survey , a massive public opinion poll conducted since 1972, documents some of these changes in white attitudes. In 1972, for instance, nearly two-thirds of whites said homeowners should be able to discriminate against blacks when selling their homes. That number fell to 28 percent by 2008.
The share of white Americans who would disapprove a family member's marriage to a black person has fallen rapidly since the 1990s, yet remains rather astonishingly high. Fully one quarter of whites said they would oppose such a marriage in 2008, the same year America elected the son of a white mother and a black father to the highest office in the land.
More than four-in-ten white Americans still say whites are more hardworking than blacks, and one-in-five say whites are more intelligent. Similarly, a majority of whites say that lack of willpower among blacks is driving racial inequality, and one-in-ten say that blacks are poor simply because of a lesser ability to learn.
As I alluded above, you can read these charts two ways: as a story of changing white attitudes -- "becoming nicer" -- over time, or as a marker of just how much progress remains to be made.
It's hard to look at these numbers and conclude that we somehow live in a "post-racial" society, or to believe, as a majority of whites do , that racism against whites is as big a problem as racism against blacks. We often speak of racism now as an "implicit" rather than an explicit problem -- that the subconscious biases we all hold have created a society of " racism without racists ." (Don't believe this? Go take an implicit bias test and let me know how you do).
But numbers like the 25 percent of white Americans who would be upset by an interracial marriage in the family show that racism is still a very explicit phenomenon. Since we know that people have a tendency to tell pollsters what they think they want to hear , these numbers are likely undercounts, and potentially large ones.
"Let’s hope America keeps producing nicer white people," Chris Rock says. It's not going to be easy.

Ready for winter You car should be0
Locks and hinges: A graphite-based or synthetic lubricant is recommended for locks, oil for hinges. Squirt on door, hood, trunk hinges and hood latch/release mechanism.
Tires and brakes: Install winter tires on all four wheels or rotate your all season tires. Inspect the brake pads or shoes while tires are off. If rotors of drums are scored or worn, replace them. Check the air pressure on all tires, including the spare. In winter, tires lose 1 pound of pressure for each 10-degree drop in temperature. Look for worn or uneven treads.
Paint: Use automotive touchup paint to seal any scratches or dings. After washing the car, protect the finish and give it a solid shine by waxing.
Lights and light bulbs: Turn the lights on and walk around the vehicle to check for burned-out bulbs. Have a friend sit inside and operate the brakes, turn signals and flashers. Do not forget the high beams. Make sure your headlights are properly aimed. Owner's manuals list replacement bulbs.
Interior
Windows: Clean with vinegar and water or automotive glass cleaner to cut through the dirt and haze; it may take a few times to end streaking. Check your defroster and rear window defogger.
Floor mats: For winter, substitute carpet remnants, which can be placed under a tire for added traction when stuck in snow. Consider deep rubber mats to collect melting snow.
Upholstery: Clean the seats top to bottom and apply protectant to all leather, vinyl and fabric.
Instruments and bulbs: Check all dash lights, warning lights and gauges when you turn key on. If all lights don't glow, replace necessary bulbs.

A strong profit booking will play tomorrow after RBI announcements, irrespective of the rate cut annoucement. Markets are poised for a fall, especially the rate sensitives such as banks, auto and realty. Today we had a glimpse of it except stocks such as DLF, which got a lot of speculative and operator attention propping it up almost 4%. Not sure if we will see the same tomorrow. DLF is a weak stock. THe management is talking of just 3500 crores of projects this year out which they have managed only 900 crores in the first half. There are a lot of if and buts and all are well aware about the various regulatory spats its involved in and mother of all, panga with the NDA government due to its close partnership with "damaadji". Not too optimistic on the political nexus getting punished but fundamentals of DLF are weak and going to stay so for quite some time.

Stocks of banks and Bank Nifty futures are likely to react strongly if the Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan surprises market with a rate cut announcement. Though expectations are low in the market for a rate cut, India Inc and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley are expecting at least a 0.25 percentage point cut that could propel the economy. On the other hand, a dovish stance or status quo won't be able to stop a reversal of the rising trend in equities.

Trinamool targets BJP in ParliamentTrinamool targets BJP in Parliament
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Dec 01, 2014 08:18 PM IST
Facing heat over the Saradha scam, Trinamool Congress today targeted BJP in Parliament by alleging that a diary of jailed Sahara group chief Subrata Roy contained the name of a senior leader of the saffron party, leading to clashes and a walkout.
A day after BJP President Amit Shah's rally in Kolkata attacking Mamata Banerjee government, Trinamool Congress sought to corner the ruling party in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha by displaying a red diary.
The Trinamool members alleged that the diary was recovered from Roy and claimed that it contained name of a BJP leader. In the Lok Sabha, Trinamool Congress members rushed to the Well shouting slogans. They demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should explain what action CBI has taken after the name allegedly figured in the diary.
They later staged a walkout. TMC leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay had given a notice for suspension of Question Hour to discuss the issue which was rejected by Speaker Sumitra Mahajan. Parliamentary Affairs Minister M Venkaiah Naidu said rules do not permit any member naming anyone who is not a member of the House.
They also cannot display placards, he said. To this, the Speaker said the name of the BJP leader would not go on record. Later, BJP member Kirit Somaiya hit back, alleging that the West Bengal government of Trinamool Congress was creating "hurdles" in the CBI investigation into the Saradha chit fund scam, in which names of "one dozen" Trinamool leaders have cropped up.
This led to protests by Trinamool members but Somaiya went on saying that 3.5 lakh small investors had been cheated in the chit fund scheme. "The state government is not cooperating with the CBI probe," he alleged. Amid noisy scenes, the Speaker adjourned the House for lunch, ahead of schedule. In the Rajya Sabha, Derek O'Brien (TMC) sought to raise the issue during Zero Hour and Question Hour but was disallowed. He had earlier given a notice for suspension of Question Hour but was not allowed. As O'Brien rose to raise the issue during Question Hour, BJP members shouted him down by raising the issue of Saradha chit fund scam. Trinamool members later staged a walkout as they were disallowed from raising the issue.

Star Cuts to take on neighbourhood salonsStar Cuts to take on neighbourhood salons
T E Narasimhan | Chennai Dec 01, 2014 09:30 PM IST
Groom India Salon & Spa, which owns Naturals and Page 3, leading brands in the beauty salon industry, is looking at launching a new brand that will take on the largely unorganised neighbourhood salons.
The company is also lining up major expansion plans for Naturals by opening 3,000 stores in India and 100 outside India over the next three years. The company is also looking at raising around Rs 100 crore from private equity.
C K Kumaravel, CEO & Co-founder of Naturals, says the new brand 'Star Cuts' is currently under trial run in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu with two stores and this will be expanded in the next six months.
The new brand will help Groom straddle the entire pyramid through Naturals (Unisex), Naturals W, (Women), Naturals Lounge and Page 3 (which caters to elite and celebrities), and now Star Cuts.
Groom's brands are competing with some of the major brands including Lakme, Green Trends (which is owned by Kumaravel's brother C K Ranganathan of CavinKare) and others in the Rs 6,000 crore market, which is growing at around 30 per cent ever year.
At present, the bottom of the pyramid market is addressed by local neighbourhood salons whereas all the organised players are addressing the levels above this.
Speaking about company's expansion plan, Kumaravel says over the next three years the company will take the franchise route. Asked whether it's an over-ambitious number, Kumaravel said four years ago, the company opened just seven stores a year. That number has gone up to 100 a year.
"We have identified 20 more markets in the country, if we can open 20 in each of these markets every month, we can achieve our target," he said.
One of the major focus will be tier II, III towns across the country, besides metros. "We will also go closure to the customer by opening salons in colleges, airports, offices, organised super markets etc," he said. For Page 3, the plan is to take the total number of stores to 25 from the current four in three years.
Commenting on the overseas strategy, he said the focus will be the Gulf Cooperation Council, including Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The company is looking at opening 100 stores in these countries, under the Naturals brand in the next three years.
"The USP would be that apart from our regular services, we will also offer Ayurveda to customers," said Kumaravel.
To support the expansion and to strengthen the brand, the company roped in Kareena Kapoor, who has replaced Genelia D'Souza, as the brand ambassador of Naturals hair and beauty salon chain. The company will be spending around Rs 45 crore in 2015 and will come out with a new advertisement campaign in April, during the next Indian Premier League season.
To address the human resource challenge, the company has tied up with Godrej Good & Green to set up the largest training academy in India. The academy is expected to go on stream in January 2015.
Launched over a decade ago, Naturals today is India's No.1 unisex hair and beauty salon. With a network of more than 4100 salons evenly spread across the country. Naturals' mission is to create 1,000 successful women entrepreneurs and generate 50,000 job opportunities by December 2017.
The brand turnover for 2012-13 was Rs 300 crore and this year it is expected to close with Rs 350 crore. The target: Rs 2,000 crore in three years.

Sarhad Dairy to treble processing capacitySarhad Dairy to treble processing capacity
Vimukt Dave | Rajkot Dec 01, 2014 08:59 PM IST
Kutch-based Sarhad Dairy is going to expand its storage and packaging capacity with an investment of Rs 70 crore. This project will be completed within next two years and will increase the dairy's processing capacity three times from a current 50,000 litres per day.
"At present, we are sending our milk collection for packaging to Ahmedabad at Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation's (GCMMF) plant as we have very small packaging facility in Anjar taluka of Kutch. We are in process of setting up new packaging and storage unit with some new products manufacturing under Amul brand," said Valamji Humbal, chairman, Sarhad Dairy, Kutch. He is also positioned as director in GCMMF which markets milk and milk products under the Amul brand.

Humbal said,"The new plant will have an initial processing capacity of 150,000 litres per day, which would be expandable upto 600,000 litres per day in the long run."
The dairy is also planning to double its procurement from a current 350,000 litres per day. With the new packaging and storage capacity, it will also increase collection centers in Kutch area. at presently it has about 600 collection centers in Kutch area, mostly near Anjar. This new plant will produce more than fifteen other products including milk powder, butter, ghee, butter milk, curd and ice cream under the Amul brand. The dairy is also considering to provide life insurance cover of Rs 100,000 to the women associated with it. For this it will soon open tender and invite insurance companies. Around 15,000 women are associated with the dairy.
"We are planning to give life insurance to milk farmers and premium for this will paid by Sarhad Dairy", said Valamji Humbal.

Equating Islam with violence wrong  says Pope FrancisEquating Islam with violence wrong, says Pope Francis

Pope Francis said on Sunday that equating Islam with violence was wrong and called on Muslim leaders to issue a global condemnation of terrorism to help dispel the stereotype.
Francis, the leader of 1.2 billion Roman Catholics, told reporters aboard his plane returning from a visit to Turkey that he understood why Muslims were offended by many in the West who automatically equated their religion with terrorism. Francis' predecessor, Benedict XVI, caused storms of protest throughout the Islamic world in 2006, when he made a speech that suggested to many Muslims that he believed Islam espoused violence.
 Benedict said he had been misunderstood and apologised. But this year, the image of a violent religion has once more been promoted by Islamic State, who have seized swathes of Syria and Iraq, slaughtering or driving out Shi'ite Muslims, Christians and others who do not share their radical brand of Sunni Islam.
The Argentine pope, who has been trying to foster cooperation with moderate Islam in order to work for peace and protect Christians in the Middle East, said it was wrong for anyone to react to terrorism by being "enraged" against Islam.
"You just can't say that, just as you can't say that all Christians are fundamentalists. We have our share of them (fundamentalists). All religions have these little groups," he said. "They (Muslims) say: 'No, we are not this, the Koran is a book of peace, it is a prophetic book of peace'."
Watch: Pope visits religious sites in Istanbul
 Francis said he had made the suggestion of a global condemnation of terrorism by Islamic leaders in talks on Friday with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan. "I told the president that it would be beautiful if all Islamic leaders, whether they are political, religious or academic leaders, would speak out clearly and condemn this because this would help the majority of Muslim people," he said. Francis several times condemned Islamic State's insurgents during his three-day trip.
On the plane, he said some Christians had been forced to abandon everything: "They are driving us out of the Middle East." In an address at a Mass on Sunday, he said Islamic State were committing a "profoundly grave sin against God" and called for inter-religious dialogue and action against poverty to help end the conflicts in the region. He added that ending poverty was crucial, partly because it gave rise to "the recruitment of terrorists". Francis has in the past said that, while it is lawful for the international community to use force to stop an "unjust aggressor", lasting solutions must be found that tackle the root causes of violence.

Why should I ask MS Dhoni to resign  says N SrinivasanBy: Press Trust of India | Chennai |
Posted: December 1, 2014 4:24 pm
Refusing to talk about Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s role in his company India Cements, BCCI’s President-in-exile N Srinivasan on Monday made it clear that the Indian captain would not be asked to resign despite questions about conflict of interest being raised against him.
Srinivasan, who is also the ICC Chairman, declined comments on the IPL spot-fixing scandal, which is being heard
in the Supreme Court right now after Justice Mudgal Committee submitted its investigative report on the matter.
“The matter is in the court. I cannot speak on this,” Srinivasan told reporters on the sidelines of an ICC function in Chennai.
The Tamil Nadu strongman was even more curt when it came to answering questions on Dhoni, who is an employee of India Cements besides being the captain of the IPL franchise Chennai Super Kings — owned by the company.
Supreme Court has made scathing comments on the issue of conflict of interest in the case of both Dhoni and Srinivasan.
“Why should I ask him to resign?” Srinivasan shot back when asked whether Dhoni would be asked to step down.
Asked what was Dhoni’s role in India Cements, Srinivasan once again curtly said, “Why should I tell you.”
Srinivasan is under immense pressure to give up his position in the BCCI in the wake of the Mudgal Committee’s
observations on his role in the scandal.
The committee, while giving a clean chit to Srinivasan personally, has observed that the BCCI chief turned a blind
eye to the wrongdoings in the league.

13 CRPF men killed in Maoist attack in Chhattisgarh  death toll likely to riseMaoist attack kills 14 CRPF personnel in Chhattisgarh
Ejaz Kaiser/Rajesh Ahuja , Hindustan Times  Raipur/New Delhi, December 01, 2014
First Published: 17:52 IST(1/12/2014) | Last Updated: 08:15 IST(2/12/2014)

At least 14 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were killed and about a dozen wounded in an encounter with Maoists near Chintagufa in Chhattisgarh’s Sukma district on Monday, the biggest loss of lives in anti-Maoist operations after the NDA government assumed charge in May.
Security forces were deep inside the forests about 450 km from state capital Raipur, when Maoist gunmen attacked them, using villagers as shields, officials said. The CRPF launched a special operation on November 16 to corner the First Battalion of the CPI (Maoist)’s Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee who have a stronghold in the area.
"Fourteen jawans have died in the ambush," additional director general (anti-Maoist operation) Rajinder Kumar Vij told HT. The dead included two officers.
The death toll is likely to go up with security forces unable to carry out rescue operations in the firing that went on until late evening. “We have to wait till Tuesday morning to take out the injured personnel and the bodies from the remote forested terrain,” Vij added.
Union home minister Rajnath Singh, who will visit Chhattisgarh on Tuesday to assess the situation, condemned the attack, calling it a dastardly act of violence. “It is an act of cowardice,’ he said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi also tweeted about the incident: “Words are not enough to condemn the brutal and inhuman attack by anti-national elements in Sukma, Chhattisgarh.”

— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) December 1, 2014
Around half a dozen CRPF personnel were wounded in another encounter in the same area on November 21 and insurgents also fired at an Indian Air Force (IAF) helicopter that had come to carry the wounded.
“When an IAF chopper came to pick the injured, it was also fired upon…  This time, when the encounter started in the morning, Maoists used villagers as human shields,” said a senior CRPF officer.
Maoist guerillas, claiming to fight for the rights of tribal communities and landless farmers, often engage in gunfights with government forces in the forested and hilly terrains of central and east India and have a presence in 16 of Chhattisgarh’s 27 districts, including Sukma.
The CRPF is also without a chief after former director general Dilip Trivedi retired on Sunday.
“Why this adhocism when daily operations are on against Maoists?” a counter-insurgency official said, requesting anonymity. “The government could have appointed Trivedi’s successor at least two weeks before his retirement so that he would have known where his men are fighting.”
Meanwhile, the security forces in Bastar zone have been put on high alert following the Maoist’s observation of Peoples Liberation of Guerrillas Army (PGLA) week from Tuesday (December 2-8).

India looking to co-produce weapons with US | US delegation in town to talk defenceDefence
(India has shortlisted five…)
WASHINGTON: India has shortlisted five of the 17 hi-tech items of military hardware offered by the US for co-production and co-development under a one-of-its kind American offer to boost bilateral defence cooperation.
These items are believed to be - naval guns, mine scattering anti-tank vehicles, unmanned aerial surveillance system, Javelin missiles, and aircraft landing system for carriers, informed defence sources familiar with the development between the two countries, told.
The five are "currently being looked at more seriously" by India's DRDO and Defence Ministry.
It was more than a year ago that the US in consultation with its private sector had offered India a list of 17 hi-tech defence items for co-production and co-development.
The one-of-its kind offer was made under the Defence Trade and Technology Initiative (DTTI) launched under the previous UPA government.
The list of 17 American defence items, which remains classified and has not been made public, was reviewed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and the Ministry of Defence.
According to informed sources, these five projects are now being reviewed by the Indian army, navy and air force, following which the Indian government would convey its decision to the Pentagon about the projects that it is interested in for co-production and co-development.
Despite India opting for the Israeli "Spike" anti-tank guided missile (ATGM), the US-made Javelin has not been ruled out, sources said.
The US has offered to co-produce the third-generation Javelin ATGMs, and co-develop its fourth-generation version.
  It is believed that India had pre-informed the US about its decision to opt for the Israeli missile to meet its immediate and short-term needs.
"We respect the Indian decision making process on this. It is a sovereign decision that India has to make. Obviously we think that American products and American systems have a lot to offer. We would have liked to win that (Javelin) competition.
"But there is a huge amount of possibility, and a number of spheres we want to talk to India about," US Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs, Puneet Talwar said on the eve of his visit to New Delhi.

Tyagi said both the ISRO and HAL we will work to ensure that the make-in-India efforts succeed in the space sector.

Amit Shah is named in Sahara  red diary : TMCComments
Trinamool Congress on Monday launched an offensive on the Bharatiya Janata Party in Parliament and held a rally in Kolkata to counter the saffron party president Amit Shah's criticism of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Sunday.
Facing heat over the Saradha scam, Trinamool targeted the BJP inside as well as outside Parliament by alleging that a diary of jailed Sahara group chief Subrata Roy contained the name of a senior leader of the saffron party, leading to clashes and a walkout.
Placard-wielding Trinamool MPs held a demonstration outside Parliament demanding a probe into alleged links between Shah and the Sahara money laundering case.
Trinamool sought to corner the ruling party in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha by displaying symbolic red diaries.
The Trinamool members alleged the diary was recovered from Sahara chief Subrata Roy by the Central Bureau of Investigation during searches at Sahara's office and claimed it contained the name of a BJP leader.
Attack in Parliament
In Lok Sabha, Trinamool MPs rushed to the Well shouting slogans, carrying red-coloured diaries which had "Sahara" written on it. They demanded that PM Modi should explain what action the CBI has taken after the name allegedly figured in the diary. They later staged a walkout.
Bandyopadhyay had given a notice for suspension of Question Hour to discuss the issue which was rejected by Speaker Sumitra Mahajan.
"They (Trinamool MPs) have decided not to follow the rules," she said.
Parliamentary affairs minister M Venkaiah Naidu said according to rules no member can name anyone who is not a member of the House. They also cannot display placards, he said.
To this, the Speaker said the name of the BJP leader would not go on record.
After protesting for a few minutes, the Trinamool MPs staged a walkout.
Minister of state for home affairs Kiren Rijiju, however, denied the presence of the "red diary".
"These are political allegations. There is no truth in it. No such diary was recovered," Rijiju told reporters in Delhi.
Later, BJP member Kirit Somaiya hit back, alleging that the Trinamool government in West Bengal was creating "hurdles" in the CBI investigation into the Saradha chit fund scam, in which names of "one dozen" Trinamool leaders have cropped up.
This led to protests by Trinamool members but Somaiya went on saying that 3.5 lakh small investors had been cheated in the chit fund scheme.
"The state government is not cooperating with the CBI probe," he alleged.
Amid noisy scenes, the Speaker adjourned the House for lunch, ahead of schedule.
In Rajya Sabha, Trinamool's Derek O'Brien sought to raise the issue during Zero Hour and Question Hour but was disallowed.
He had earlier given a notice for suspension of Question Hour but was not allowed.
As O'Brien rose to raise the issue during Question Hour, BJP members shouted him down by raising the issue of Saradha chit fund scam.
The members flashed symbolic red diaries with Sahara written on them, and tried to storm the well of the upper house as well to press their demand.
Trinamool members later staged a walkout as they were disallowed from raising the issue.
Counter-rally in Kolkata
Mamata Banerjee's nephew and Diamond Harbour Lok Sabha MP, Abhisekh Banerjee, said the West Bengal chief minister does not want to respond to Shah as she believes "he is not of her stature".
Mamata cancelled an appearance at the rally held by Abhishek to counter Shah's allegations levelled against her by Shah.
Speaking almost from the same spot where Shah delivered his Sunday speech, Abhisekh attacked the BJP and PM Modi saying he has done nothing for West Bengal after coming to power.
Abhisekh mocked Modi by comparing him with his aunt saying while he flies in private jets, goes abroad and changes wardrobe frequently, Mamata stays in a small house, wears handloom sarees and chappals.
Without naming Shah, he said those who come to Bengal like migratory birds, address a rally and return to Delhi will not win elections in the state.
Abhisekh also alleged Union minister of law and justice Sadanand Gowda's assets jumped from Rs. 9 crore to Rs. 20 crore in three months, and BJP must explain it.
Shah on Sunday had sounded the poll bugle to oust Trinamool from the state in the 2015 Kolkata Municipal Corporation and 2016 assembly elections and called for a Trinamool-free Bengal.
The BJP's rise in Bengal has sparked speculations about new equations in the state's political arena where the saffron brigade was only a fringe player until recently.
However, banking on Modi's poll promises on development, the party bagged an impressive 16.8% vote share in the April-May Lok Sabha elections. Even though the BJP won just two of the 42 seats, it made an impact.
Frequent clashes between BJP and Trinamool supporters have been reported in West Bengal since the polls.
The BJP chief's address came at a time when the ruling Trinamool is reeling under graft allegations in the multi-crore Saradha chit fund scam and the Burdwan blasts on October 2 that killed two alleged militants from Bangladesh.
Addressing the rally that saw a crowd of two lakh people, Shah had attacked Banerjee over the Saradha case, terrorist activities as well as lack of development in the state.
The TMC on Sunday had refused to attach much importance to Shah's rally and described it as a 'grand flop show'.
The city police, West Bengal fire department and the Kolkata Municipal Corporation had denied permission for the event at the Victoria House, where the ruling Trinamool usually organises its annual martyrs' day rally.
An intervention by the Calcutta high court saw the BJP getting the nod only at the eleventh hour.

Go girls! Rohtak sisters hailed as heroes for fighting molestersArmy slams door on Rohtak molesters

The army will not go ahead with the recruitment process of three men accused of molesting two Haryana sisters on a bus after a video of the women thrashing the alleged molesters sparked widespread outrage across the country, army sources said on Monday.

Defence minister Manohar Parrikar made it clear a strong message should be sent that there was no place for such men in the army while the Haryana chief minister said the women would be honoured for their “act of bravery” on Republic Day as public support for the sisters grew on social media.
"We (the army) take such issues very seriously and we have a zero-tolerance policy. Two of the youths had cleared physical and medical tests in one of the rallies held in Haryana recently but they would not be allowed to take part in further process which is a written test," sources said.
Aarti Kuhar, 22, and her sister, Pooja, 19, were travelling in a Haryana Roadways bus on Friday on their way to Government College for Women in Rohtak district, when the three men allegedly molested them. The women protested at first and then hit back with their hands, legs and even a belt, while other passengers watched silently.
A pregnant woman, sitting next to the sisters, captured the incident on her mobile phone camera and shared it on WhatsApp. The video went viral in no time.
Watch: Haryana sisters thrash molesters in bus, mute passengers look on
“Go brave girls! #girlrising and wake up bystanders! Its shameful, the only one who intervened was a pregnant woman!” tweeted Freida Pinto, star of Academy-award winning film Slumdog Millionaire.
Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar announced a cash reward of Rs. 31,000 rupees each for the sisters, saying he hoped the publicity would sensitise others to the issue. “The kind of work that has been done by these two girls is praiseworthy,” he said.
A local court sent the three men to jail on Monday while the government suspended the bus driver and conductor for failing to protect the women.
The sisters, who stay with their parents in Thanakhurd village in Sonepat district, said the three men threw pieces of paper with their phone numbers at the women who did not respond. Angry at being rebuffed, the men asked them to vacate their seats.
“They said girls were meant to sit on bus bonnets and if we did not leave the seat for them, they would throw us out,” said Pooja.
Aarti said the conversation became heated but it was not until one of the men molested her that she hit them. “A pregnant lady tried to raise her voice, but the men were unmoved and continued groping us with their hands,” she added.
The incident  has once again highlighted the issue of women’s safety after the December 2012 brutal gang-rape of a young girl in Delhi that sparked nationwide protests. Haryana has also been in the news because of its skewed sex ratio and khap panchayats that routinely issue diktats against women.

Samsung might launch Tizen-based smartphone in India thismonthSamsung might launch a Tizen smartphone on December 10 under Rs Rs 10,000.
Posted: December 1, 2014 9:56 pm | Updated: December 1, 2014 10:27 pm
South Korean electronic giant Samsung is expected to launch a smartphone, based on its new Tizen operating system, in India later this month.
According to sources, the smartphone major is expected to launch the device on December 10 in the affordable category (sub-Rs 10,000).
The company was not available for comments. Currently, only a few devices, including Samsung’s smartwatch products run on the Tizen platform.
A majority of Samsung’s mobile phones are currently powered by the Android platform, which is also the dominant OS on most smartphones across the globe.
Launched as a competitor to Android and iOS OS’, Tizen aims to address the needs of stakeholders of mobile and connected device ecosystem, including device manufacturers, mobile operators, application developers and independent software vendors (ISVs).
In June, Samsung had showcased ‘Samsung Z’, which came with a 4.8 inch HD display and 2.3 GHz Quad-core processor.
Showcased at the Tizen Developer Conference, San Francisco, the handset featured 8MP rear camera, 2.1MP front camera, 2GB RAM, 16 GB internal memory (expandable up to 64GB) and a 2,600 mAh battery.
The company had planned to make the handset available in Russia in third quarter in Russia, but the plan was scrapped.
Previously, Samsung ran ‘Bada’ OS, which did not see much success. It has since been working on merging the platform with Tizen, which is backed by chipmaker Intel Corp.
The other popular operating systems include Apple iOS, Microsoft’s Windows Phone OS and BlackBerry’s proprietary platform.

Master bladesmith: New lightsaber design is a terrible ideaBy Andrea Peterson November 28 Follow @kansasalps
This lightsaber is a terrible idea. (Disney)
The first trailer for Star Wars: The Force Awakens dropped this morning. And almost immediately, people began commenting on the design of a Sith lightsaber with what appears to be mini-blades shooting out of the hilt as a sort of crossguard.
So we asked a certified master bladesmith who specializes in swords: Is there any point to having a crossguard on your lightsaber?
"The idea behind a crossguard on any blade is to protect the swordsman's hand from another person's blade," explains Kevin Cashen from his home in Michigan. So it might not seem so crazy for lightsabers to have cross guards, especially given the tendency for hand amputations in Star Wars film series.
But Cashen says the lightsaber design would likely leave the wielder's hands in even greater peril.
"That would be very bad to have around your hand," said Cashen. Even with more traditional hilts, larger crossguards can often snag the users more than it can do something against the opponent, he said.
And a weaponized crossguard with plasma-like blades could be a disaster for a user, especially if they engaged in the more acrobatic style of combat deployed in the prequel trilogy.  "That hilt would just take you apart if you started to do a lot of complex spinning," said Cashen.
There is a side function of crossguards where the mini-blades might be helpful, though. Sometimes crossguards could be used to bash opponents at close range, said Cashen.
But that's basically the only use he could see for the lightsaber-bladed crossguard. And that specific function doesn't make up for the dubious nature of the design. "The problem is the other 80 percent of the time you'd be in grave danger of searing yourself," he said.
Lightsabers have seen little variation since being introduced in the first Star Wars Film in 1977, with the exception of the dual-ended lightsaber wielded by Darth Maul in Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace.

But they continue to be an iconic symbol of the franchise -- and an object of fascination for sword enthusiasts. "The lightsaber thing comes up a lot in my field." said Cashen.  "It's the ultimate extreme of what swords can't do."

Where To Retire If You Want To Live  The Good LifeFriends returned recently from an extended stay in Thailand. They'd also recently spent time on the west coast of the United States (Los Angeles, Portland, and Seattle) and a month in Paris.
Their conclusion?
That at street level Paris costs roughly double the west coast of the United States. The United States in turn costs roughly double Bangkok or Chiang Mai in Thailand.
For example, a small, plain cheese pizza for one person costs 12 euro in Paris, 6 euro in Seattle ($8.50), and 3 euro in Thailand. A small espresso in a Paris bar costs $4, about double that of Starbucks in Portland. A monthly bus pass costs $100 in Paris, $50 in Los Angeles. A hamburger in a bar costs $20 in Paris, $10 in Portland, and $5 in Bangkok. A light bulb cost 4 euro in Paris, 2 in Los Angeles, 1 in Bangkok.
So given that Paris costs double Los Angeles and Los Angeles costs double Bangkok, other things being equal, you'd choose Bangkok, right?
Not exactly. First of all, other things are never equal. Bangkok has a tropical climate, Los Angeles a desert climate, and Paris the inevitable Northern European rain and cold. Bangkok has a king, Los Angeles a middle-of-the-road democracy, and Paris a leftist world view. The three countries differ in language, culture, and other specifics. You may have many friends in Bangkok and none in Paris, or the other way around.
Also, you care less about the overall cost of living than you do about your cost of living. Take transport, for example. In Paris and Bangkok most people live without the required-in-Los-Angeles car. What do you care what a car costs in Paris if you intend to live without a car?
Similarly, good wine costs a fortune in Bangkok, because of 400 percent Thai taxes. California wines are way overpriced. In France, on the other hand, very good wine costs as little as $5 or $10 a bottle, especially if you visit the winery.
Your personal cost of living depends overwhelmingly on what you like to do and how you like to do it. If you enjoy French wine and duck, culture and history, and the European change of seasons, you might be able to set up life in France outside Paris at reasonable cost. Even in Paris if you can find a place to stay, you can buy unlimited transportation on buses, subways, and intra-city trains for less than $100 a month. And you're living in Paris, where walks around town cost nothing, where the local Monoprix sells duck confit for only 10 euro a can (serves four), where you can meditate in a Gothic church down the block.
Remember, too, that you can move around from place to place, from high cost to low and back again. Your average cost of living comes down if you include cheaper places more often. Moving around also means you avoid daunting visa requirements.
Many people hate to move once they've settled in. Still, consider making yourself at home in several places, including renting the same place for the same three months, again and again. Return to your two or three favorite cities every year, like snowbirds. You'll find many other expats doing the same in Chiang Mai, Fort Cochi, Paris, San Miquel de Allende, Valencia, and Buenos Aires.
Make it a point to skip the expensive wine in Bangkok, the car in Paris, and the elective surgery in Los Angeles. Never, ever buy glasses in Paris, go to the hospital in Seattle, or buy a new English-language book in Bangkok.
Instead practice a little arbitrage. Buy dental care in Chiang Mai, walking shoes in Portland, and cheese in Paris. Buy glasses in Pondicherry, wine in Mendoza, and a new hip in Bangkok.
Finally, take advantage of your wealth, of what you've managed to save from the work years. We read about billionaires who pay $300 million for sailboats or $50 million for paintings. A Silicon Valley investor just bought a huge penthouse apartment in San Francisco with only one bedroom, for himself. He'll put up his guests in the Four Seasons next-door. What do these very rich people care about thousand-dollar hotel rooms?
On the joke list of the world's thinnest books comes "Things I Can't Afford" by Bill Gates.
So you have something less than a billion dollars. But you may have enough to live in Paris or other expensive cities for at least a few months each year. If you're so inclined, go for it. You want to die having lived the good life rather than having avoided expensive places.

Why I Think Customer Service Is Worse Than Everreddit
Since October, I've been trying to find a company that can fix something in my home, before it got too cold.
It was easy to find companies that would sell all new equipment and install. However, I am looking for someone who would also provide estimates for repair, as I believe the largest and most expensive components are salvageable; it's the supporting pieces that are in disrepair.
Finding companies that provide repair services have been extremely hard to find. The first I encountered was fairly close by, and had positive online customer reviews. I called the number, expecting to get a voice mail greeting typical of a small, independent contractor.
Instead, the call was answered in a way that evoked "call center." A man's voice announced a different company name right before the particular contractor name -- like "Hello, this is Home Services LLC answering for Bob Smith Home Repair, how may I help you?"
I explained my need, and heard him key-stroking. He said it appears Bob Smith is no longer accepting any work through Home Services LLC. Really -- then why are you still answering the phone for Bob Smith? He said he could email me a list of other providers. I only received a satisfaction survey.
I found another company that provided repair estimates. I called, and the recording assured me how important my call was, and that they would call back ASAP.
More than 24 hours later, I called again. A person answered; let's call him Robert. I said I wanted an assessment on whether the problem could be repaired, or if it would be best just to replace everything. When could he come out?
Robert must not have heard a word I said. After a long, rambling explanation that repairs are sometimes more costly, I said "I understand that. That's why I want you to give me your professional opinion. When can you come out?"
I gave Robert my address, and he said he could be there between 2 and 4 p.m. I was at work, but my night-shift roommate agreed to stay home. Robert promised to call around 2 to give a more accurate time. Right before I hung up, he asked how I found the business. He seemed genuinely surprised. I told him exactly the words I googled, and that his company web site was near the top of the page of returns. I heard him say to someone else "He said he googled it!" like this was magic.
I hadn't heard anything when I left work at 4, and halfway home I heard my cell ringing. I let it go into voice mail, figuring he had just arrived. I got home, expecting to see a work van in my driveway. It was empty. I listened to my voice mail (left at 4:20) and it was Robert, saying that he was delayed, and now he "didn't feel like fighting traffic."
I called him back and expressed my disappointment. He said he could come the next day, if I'd allow him to. We agreed to speak in the morning. I called Robert at 8 a.m. He estimated he would finish his first project no later than 1 p.m., and he promised to call with his ETA.
When I hadn't heard anything by 3:30 p.m., I called Robert and got his voice mail. I asked him to call so we could work something out. He never called back.
I found another that advertised they would provide repair estimates under the "right circumstances." I called, and the woman who answered seemed completely uninterested in my business. Instead, she gave me the contact info of someone "who specializes in that sort of thing." I found the website, and I felt relieved when I read the home page.
The owner, who we'll call Jack, decided to start the business because he himself couldn't find anyone to provide this service. He even calls himself the "doctor", and his mission is to run the best business possible, with the highest standards of ethics and quality.
I filled out the online inquiry form. I called the number, and got Jack's greeting, which also gave an email address. I not only left a detailed voice mail, but I also sent an email. That made three points of contact. I was hopeful.
I called and left another message the following day.
Today marks one week after I left the three initial points of contact. I have yet to hear from the "doctor."
The least they could do is update their website; maybe with something like this:
"In 2005, we were amazed at how hard it was to find this service. So, we decided to start our own business. We made so much money, we're now retired and living in Florida. So long, suckers!"
Customer Service: You're doing it wrong.

Women in Business Q&A: Loretta Jones  VP Marketing  Insightlyreddit
Loretta Jones is the vice president of marketing at Insightly , a San Francisco-based SaaS CRM application for small businesses. With more than 15 years of experience in marketing, including marketing strategy, communications and lead generation, Loretta has grown marketing programs for both SMB and enterprise customers at Coveo, Adobe EchoSign and several other companies. She holds a bachelor's degree from Brown University.
How has your life experience made you the leader you are today?
Growing up outside the U.S. in India, Kenya and Spain, among others countries, taught me a lot about how people operate in different cultures. This international experience helps me with tolerance and patience, and also gives me a real sense that there are more commonalities than differences between people.
How has your previous employment experience aided your position at Insightly?
I've been lucky in that I've worked for companies that have marketed to different audiences - both enterprise and small and medium-sized businesses. With such broad marketing experience, I've been able to adapt to businesses' needs and market shifts pretty easily. I started my career at Lotus, and then moved to several positions at growing startups. Making these transitions made me realize how much discipline there is at larger companies. Early-stage startups can sometimes be like the Wild West; people are playing multiple roles and they don't always work efficiently. As startups grow, sometimes they are a bit loathe to implement processes because they fear it will inhibit creativity and make the company lose its startup feel. The trick is to spot the places where processes improve efficiency and work life and not over-process everything just for the sake of process. The benefit of some processes is that they also set expectations and often people work more effectively when there are clear expectations. With multiple marketing roles under my belt, it's easier to draw on my experience and identify which areas in marketing require a process and when there should be more creative leeway.
What have the highlights and challenges been during your tenure at Insightly?
The biggest challenge at Insightly has been carving out a niche within the crowded customer relationship management (CRM) space. There are millions of small businesses out there, and we're trying to differentiate ourselves. It's a process of positioning and refinement. We're continuously working to get to know our audiences, and learning how our audience views us as different from competitors. What's made the challenge easier is that our strategy and programs - including public relations, content marketing and demand generation - work in a synergistic way so this has helped us gain market momentum.
What advice can you offer women who are seeking a career in marketing and the IT industry?
Marketing in tech, like most other industries, is like alchemy - there are many pieces that can indicate success or failure. To be successful you need to have a curious and investigative nature. You also need to be patient because many programs don't work on the first try, so be prepared to tweak and change. Also, know when to recognize something isn't working and cut your losses. You can't be afraid to make mistakes. Action is better than inaction because even if your action didn't meet your expectation, you learned something, and learning from your mistakes makes you a better marketer.
How do you maintain a work/life balance?
I truly separate my time at work and my personal time. When I come into the office, I'm laser-focused on getting work done. I try to have as little distraction as possible. This way, when I leave the office I don't have to think about things I need to do or what I didn't finish, making it easy to maintain a work/life balance.
In general, tech companies have a casual atmosphere and offer daily services that blur the line between work/personal life - onsite dry cleaning services, or three catered meals each day, or on-premise yoga. These are all great services, but they do send a message that there is no difference between your work and personal life. So the upside may be greater productivity because people might spend more time at work, but the downside is that a more casual atmosphere and daily distractions don't send a message of focus. If people aren't self-disciplined, it's easy to get distracted at work and allow social media monitoring or personal text conversations to seep into time at work, making it difficult to effectively balance the two lives.
Another way I keep my mind clear and focused is by exercising. I'm a firm believer in exercise, and any stress from the workday gets worked out and is easily put into perspective through exercise.
What do you think is the biggest issue for women in the workplace?
Women, especially younger women, often want to be liked by their colleagues or tend to be extra accommodating. This can sometimes makes it difficult for them to balance the desire to be well liked with the ability to make hard decisions.
How has mentorship made a difference in your professional and personal life?
I haven't had a lot of business mentors in my life. I did have strong support from my mother. I come from a family of seven girls, and my mother always encouraged us to stand up for ourselves, and to make sure that we could support ourselves financially. I think a strong, solid network is key, and I firmly believe in the adages "opportunity is when luck meets preparation" and "everyone is connected." In order to get ahead, it's valuable to have connections that, when combined with your own determination and intelligence, have the power to make things happen.
Which other female leaders do you admire and why?
I think the CEO of PepsiCo., Indra Krishnamurthy Nooyi, Beyoncé and Madonna are all women with good heads for business. They have created themselves as icons and have shown they can re-invent themselves if required.
What do you want Insightly to accomplish in the next year?
I want Insightly to continue to grow exponentially, yet not lose focus on delivering a product that delights our users. Insightly was launched with the goal of being an easy-to-use CRM, and as we add more features, it's always a challenge to stay close to this DNA without complicating the user interface. From an internal perspective, continuing to constantly improve and refine is important as we meet the next phase of growth.

The Case Against Business Schoolreddit
I've had to entertain a good deal of talk about business school this year. My friends and I have ripened, both in age and experience, to the point at which most prospective students apply. We're all four to six years into careers where we've tasted varying degrees of success. But we know there's something greater around the corner.  And business school is, for many, a land of greater promise than the one we inhabit now; a land that can restore us to the full glory that we were all raised to believe we'd have.
Now, my friends are a thoughtful bunch. They're supremely educated, and they've done all the impressive things they need to do to become compelling candidates, even for elite schools like Harvard and Stanford. They justification business school with great conviction and this often spills over into evangelism.  They point to the Wikipedia profiles of those who run our world, establishing the linear relationship between degree and power of decree. And they back-up their certainties through the liquidation of assets in preparation for tuition; a sacrifice that's for many is dwarfed by the salary that they will forego for the next two years.
Yet for those I know, I'd say that business school is probably not the right path to pursue. I'd have that suspicion in the face of anyone trying to sell me something as confidently and aggressively as they do their own decision on this. But let's look at what business school provides to an emerging leader. It's hardly passion; passion can be innate, but for many it's a hands-on process of trial-and-error. It could be the network, but is it really? If you're already working at a top flight consulting firm or bank, you'll have been surrounded by a phenomenal, expansive network for many years, particularly if you were funneled in from a leading academic institution. There's a case that you'll pick up skills, but if you're the sort of self-motivated individual who can succeed at the numerous professional and academic hurdles that came before, you can also pretty easily teach yourself financial modeling, accounting, or whatever else you think you're deficient in. And even more importantly, many former business school students will tell you that they did the majority of their skill learning on the job.
There are two other related justifications, which is often used by business school proponents as trump cards, but these too ultimately still rest on weak foundations. They are the notions that business school enables career switching, as well as providing a "stamp" that is increasingly necessary for being considered for many desirable jobs. My thoughts here are simple. Those who I know simply would not enjoy working for employers who are not capable of seeing round pegs and sanding off their square holes in response. Skills can be easily taught, but in a global war for talent, abilities - like those that these friends possess - are in short supply, and those who are winning that war are already seeing past the resume and designing highly-complex means to do so.
Business school may be the right decision for any one individual, but I find it increasingly hard to see why the real leaders of the future will continue to choose this path. An MBA is a form of insurance; a highly-conservative move to hedge against risk. It does establish a salary floor, and there's certainly value in that. But let's be honest about what it is: it's a move for the individual who's not confident enough that they possess what it takes to accelerate their career on their own.

Elite Daily s 25-Year-Old CEO: How He Got Zero to 40 Million Users in Two Yearsreddit
It's sometimes hard to believe that someone's first company, much less their first job, can for some people, mean running a company that's valued many millions and has over seven million visits per month. That is reality of David Arabov, the current CEO and Managing Editor of Elite Daily, the site that millennials are flocking to as of recent. Started a mere two years ago, Elite Daily, coins itself as the platform for Gen Y-ers to post and read content that is relevant to them.
Covering anything from dating, the latest headlines in politics and current events to posting humerous videos, it seems as though Elite Daily, is becoming the one stop shop for millennials when it comes to content. As a result, they were able to raise $1.5 million from well-known investors like Greycroft Partners and Red Sea Ventures.
Being a young CEO of a company, is undoubtedly a hard role to play in and of itself but specifically being the media industry calls for consistently being relevant, different and innovative. So how does David and his team do it? In a recent interview with Arabov, gives some insight as to the secret sauce of Elite Daily.
What do you think was the biggest attribute to Elite Daily's success so far?
From the onset we've focused on creating a digital media platform that authentically represents the millennial experience. We felt that existing media publications did not yet have an adequate solution that catered to the diverse needs of millennial readers. The solution we've developed, a content platform powered by and created for millennials, has become the "Voice of Generation Y". We've staffed our editorial team with journalists and editors who have an innate understanding of millennial culture and trends. Combined with our proprietary technology that tracks and analyzes trends across the web, we've created the fastest growing social content platform for millennials.
What do you think is Elite Daily's main obstacle today?
We recognize a need to diversify the scope of our content. Millennials are a diverse, varied group and we will be launching new initiatives to ensure that our content is representative of the wide range of individuals who fall under the "Millennial" umbrella.
In a world where so much content is being consumed on a daily basis (especially for millennials), what do you think draws readers in the most to Elite Daily?
Thousands of sites curate viral content that receives millions of pageviews per day. Few have an understanding of the emotional triggers that power social sharing, and even fewer have a solid enough understanding of millennial culture that would permit them to create content that is actually representative of the lifestyle of millennial and the issues they face. We are our readers. Our staff and contributors are our audience. Rather than gaming likes, Elite Daily has focused on translating the nuances of millennial culture to the digital web.
What would you say are the most important attributes someone needs to have to become a successful entrepreneur?
These vary person to person. In my opinion to become a successful entrepreneur you need to implement:

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has slipped to the second place in the Time magazine’s ‘Person of the Year’ poll with the Ferguson protesters surging ahead of him in a vote by the readers.
As per latest reports, Mr. Modi is leading second with 9.8 per cent of the total votes polled so far while the Ferguson protesters are leading with 10.8 per cent of the votes.
Joshua Wong, face of the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement, is placed third.
Nobel Peace prize winner Malala Yousafzai (5.3 per cent) and Russian President Vladimir Putin are placed fourth and fifth respectively.
U.S. President Barack Obama is placed at a distant 11th position with just 2.4 per cent of the total votes.
The annual poll, which is currently underway, is scheduled to end on December 6 and the poll’s winner will be announced on December 8.
However, it is the TIME’s editors who will choose the Person of the Year, which is scheduled to be announced on December 10.
Till November 26, Mr. Modi was leading the polls with 11.1 per cent of the total votes while Ferguson protesters with 8.8 per cent were ranked second.
But support for Ferguson protesters surged after a recent grand jury’s decision of not to indict a white police officer who fatally shot an unarmed black man which caused an outcry across the United States.
“Ferguson protesters surged ahead this week of the leader of the world’s largest democracy,” Time magazine said on Saturday in a story titled ‘Modi Drops From Lead in TIME’s Person of the Year Poll.’
“Modi, the newly elected Indian prime minister and leader of the largest democracy in the world, has raised high hopes among Indians that he can invigorate the country’s economy and cut bureaucratic red tape that has slowed development in India,” the magazine said.

Steve Oleksy reassigned to Hershey  earns praise from TrotzBy Alex Prewitt November 30 Follow @alex_prewitt
(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)
Long before the Washington Capitals got blown from Toronto in their worst loss of 2014-15 , they placed a call to their minor league affiliate in Hershey, Penn., and asked for their best defensemen, so Steve Oleksy boarded a plane. He joined the team across the border, called up for insurance reasons and nothing more . A healthy scratch against the Maple Leafs, Oleksy returned to the AHL one day later.
“A couple guys got banged up a little bit, so we were worried,” Coach Barry Trotz said Saturday. “We weren’t skating, so we better have someone here.”
Trotz was standing in a hallway at Air Canada Centre, chatting two hours before the puck dropped, and soon Oleksy came bounding from the visiting locker room. He waved to a reporter and went to stretch. He warmed up with the Capitals but did not play.
Had another defensemen – Trotz did not specify who “got banged up” – felt unable to go, Oleksy would have made his NHL season debut. Instead, he was promoted and demoted within 24 hours, rejoining Hershey for their home game Sunday without consequence. According to the league’s collective bargaining agreement, Oleksy would need 30 days in the NHL or 10 games in order to require waivers for reassignment, since  he already cleared them during the preseason, a product of his age (28 years old) and experience (61 games).
Back then, Trotz felt Oleksy was “probably my hardest cut” from training camp, “because he did everything he could that you ask a player to do. He fought, produced, played good D, was all-in in every situation.” But then the business side of hockey kicked in, because Jack Hillen and John Erskine both had one-way contracts, and because Oleksy was entering the final season of a three-year, two-way deal. The Capitals had already procured depth during free agency with Brooks Orpik and Matt Niskanen. Someone with NHL experience was headed to Hershey.
“I basically told him, ‘there’s nothing you could’ve did other than took a guy out to make room,’” Trotz said. “And he was good.”
Later, as Oleksy skated 19 games with Hershey and tallied six points, Trotz and general manager Brian MacLellan began talking about the future, and how they wanted defensemen like Nate Schmidt and Oleksy “in the organization full-time.”
“Those are the guys you build around,” Trotz said.
It’s easy to forget that Oleksy is the same age as Hillen, often lumped in with the organization’s blue-line prospects like Connor Carrick and Schmidt, but Trotz has liked him since training camp and the vote of confidence bodes well for Oleksy’s future once he hits free agency.
Saturday, Trotz hoped Oleksy would get some games with the Capitals sometime this season. But with the team off Sunday, practicing Monday and at home Tuesday, and with defenseman Mike Green’s return from an upper-body injury seemingly on the horizon, Oleksy’s services weren’t required for now.
“I want him to be part of the group at some point,” Trotz said. “Even if he’s up here and he doesn’t play, it’s a sign that he’s right there and we just need … if we don’t stay healthy, he’s a guy who will be here. But he’s done a great job in Hershey.”

The Government will have to borrow as much as £75bn more than it intended over the next five years, delivering a damaging blow to Chancellor George Osborne’s hopes of claiming that the Government has the country’s deficit under control.
In Mr Osborne’s last Autumn Statement this Wednesday before the general election, his attempts to boast of the Conservatives’ economic record are set to be over-shadowed by new, bleak fiscal forecasts from the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR). Collapsing revenues from oil sales, stamp duty and income tax mean the Chancellor will be forced to admit his plans to bring the deficit down could be knocked off track.
Borrowing is also expected to be revised upwards by the OBR, with the cumulative deficit expected to reach nearly £280bn by the end of the decade – £75bn more than expected. The Government has already had to borrow £3.7bn more in the first seven months of this year as the dividends of recovery fail to show up in Treasury coffers. This is despite OBR predictions in March of falling borrowing. In particular, tax receipts from North Sea oil and gas are expected to be sharply down as a result of plunging oil prices, which have sunk by nearly 40 per cent to four-year lows.
Other pressures include a slowing housing market, which are likely to cut the £12.7bn in stamp duty takings forecast by the watchdog.
And despite a near 700,000 rise in employment over the past year, this has not fed through into income tax as jobs growth has been centred at the lower-paid end of the market. 
While Mr Osborne will still be able to claim that the Government is on track to eliminate the structural deficit by 2018, it gives him much less opportunity for any pre-election giveaways.
His announcement today of £2bn more for the NHS next year will come from reductions in spending in other areas of Government.
UBS economist David Tinsley said tax receipts had been “disappointing”. “In the main this appears to reflect weakness on the income side of the Government accounts,” he said.
“We expect the OBR will have to acknowledge this, revising up borrowing in the current year and in the future years out to 2020. The cumulative increase in borrowing could be up to £75bn.”

HSBC economist Liz Martins said there was little scope for pre-election giveaways, despite the likelihood of the OBR upgrading its current 2014 growth forecasts from 2.7 per cent to closer to 3 per cent.
Paul Johnson, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said that the Chancellor will have to admit on Wednesday that the public finances are in worse shape than the OBR had been forecasting.
“We’ll probably end up with the deficit a bit higher than the OBR was expecting back in March,” he told BBC1’s Sunday Politics programme. “The consequence will be that by 2018 we are looking at spending cuts of one-third in a whole slew of public services.”
Ed Miliband will use a speech on Monday to blame the Government’s economic policies on the lost revenues.
The Labour leader will cite figures which showed lower-than-expected tax receipts and ballooning social-security payments had cost £116.5bn over the course of the parliament.
The Treasury declined to comment on the economic predictions ahead of the Autumn Statement.

Tightening of security checks for flights to the US
Following the tightening of security measures for US-bound flights, passengers flying to the United States may face extra checks on their electronic devices (mobile phone, tablets, laptops etc.) at certain airport security checkpoints. In Germany, the measures will affect direct flights from Frankfurt, Düsseldorf and Munich to the US.
We advise passengers travelling from Frankfurt, Düsseldorf or Munich to the United States to make sure that their electronic devices are charged and to keep their device charger in their hand luggage so that the devices can be switched on. If a device fails to show functionality during boarding, the device will not be permitted for travel.
At present, Lufthansa does not expect this to have any impact on its flight operations nor, in particular, does it anticipate any delays as a result. Check-in and security checks are operating as normal.
As a general rule, we advise all passengers booked on flights to the US to arrive at the airport on time (i.e. two hours before the scheduled time of departure) and to allow sufficient time to pass through security. This recommendation remains valid. In addition, we advise our passengers to make sure that larger electronic devices are charged and to remove them from their packaging/carrying case before presenting them for screening at the security checkpoint.
The German Federal Police (Bundespolizei) are responsible for conducting the security checks. Detailed questions about procedures should be directed to the German Federal Police or to the Federal Ministry of the Interior.

Rickshaw research reveals extreme Delhi pollutionRickshaw research reveals extreme Delhi pollution

In this Tuesday, Nov. 25, 2014 photo, U.S. scientist Joshua Apte monitors pollution levels on his laptop as he travels in an open-aired auto-rickshaw during rush-hour traffic in New Delhi, India. Apte has alarming findings for anyone who spends time on or near the roads in this city of 25 million, with numbers far worse than the ones that have already led the World Health Organization to rank New Delhi as the world’s most polluted city. Average pollution levels, depending on the pollutant, were 50 percent to 8 times higher on the road than urban background readings, including official ambient air pollution measures, according to research by Apte and his partners at the University of California, Berkeley, and the Indian Institute of Technology in New Delhi.

NEW DELHI (AP) — The three-wheeled rickshaw lurched through New Delhi's commuter-clogged streets with an American scientist and several air pollution monitors in the back seat. Car horns blared. A scrappy scooter buzzed by belching black smoke from its tailpipe. One of the monitors spiked.
Joshua Apte has alarming findings for anyone who spends time on or near the roads in this city of 25 million. The numbers are far worse than the ones that have already led the World Health Organization to rank New Delhi as the world's most polluted city.
Average pollution levels, depending on the pollutant, were up to eight times higher on the road than urban background readings, according to research by Apte and his partners at the University of California, Berkeley, and the Indian Institute of Technology in New Delhi.
"And you have to keep in mind that the concentrations at urban background sites, where these official monitors are, are already very high," he said. The measures "are actually some of the highest levels in air pollution made inside vehicles anywhere in the world."
The point is particularly important for New Delhi residents, about half of whom live within 300 meters (330 yards) of a major road. New Delhi, like most cities, places their air monitors far from primary pollution sources like highways or industrial plants so that no single source can affect ambient readings, which are meant to represent an average pollution exposure from all sources.
"Official air quality monitors tend to be located away from roads, on top of buildings, and that's not where most people spend most of their time," Apte said as The Associated Press joined him on a pollution-monitoring ride-along. "In fact, most people spend a lot of time in traffic in India. Sometimes one, two, three hours a day."
Outdoor air pollution kills millions worldwide every year, according to the WHO, including more than 627,000 in India. One of the biggest culprits in fast-growing India is vehicular traffic: Car ownership in the country of 1.2 billion grew from 20 million in 1991 to 140 million in 2011, and is expected to reach 400 million by 2030.
India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken steps to cut down the popularity of cars running on diesel, one of the dirtiest burning fuels, by pegging its cost to world market prices and scrapping a discount that had encouraged diesel consumption.
But experts say that, unless India raises fuel standards to international norms, pollution levels that are already often deemed unhealthy or hazardous will escalate. Unchecked, today's vehicle trends in India could lead to a three-fold increase in levels of PM 2.5 by 2030 — the tiny particulate matter believed to cause the most damage to human health — according to a study this month by The Energy and Resources Institute in New Delhi, University of California, San Diego and the California Air Resources Board.
Still, few Indian cities have air quality monitors. New Delhi officially has 11, though experts say the readings can be erratic and the reporting opaque. The city reports several key pollutants and this month launched an air quality index, boiling down the ambient readings to a single daily number indicating whether the air is healthy, poor, harmful or hazardous.
Apte, who in January starts as an assistant professor of environmental engineering at the University of Texas, Austin, said that such indices, while perhaps easier for citizens to digest, represent vague urban background readings and can't help residents understand exactly what risks they face.
What ordinary people really want to know are answers to questions like, "'Should I be taking a walk outside in this neighborhood right now?' ... 'Is it safe for my child to be playing cricket on the field here?'" he said.
Apte's goal was to highlight the huge differences between the urban background readings and ground-level pollution along roads. His approach to gathering his data involved twice-daily rush-hour drives from the city center to a southeast suburb.
He traveled in one of India's typical open-aired auto-rickshaws, which he outfitted with pollution monitoring equipment to gather second-by-second data. On one-quarter of his visits to Delhi, he developed bronchitis.
For comparison, he also took readings from inside regular cars with the windows rolled up, and from a rooftop monitor that stood for ambient air quality readings — or what the government might record and report to the public.
He found average, rush-hour levels of PM 2.5 were about 50 percent higher than ambient air quality readings, according to his team's data. The monitor shot up wildly for brief periods when lumbering vehicles emitting black smoke rolled by.
Levels of black carbon, a good indicator of diesel exhaust and poorly tuned vehicle performance, were more than three times higher than the ambient readings. The average level of ultrafine particles, especially tiny forms of PM 2.5, was more than eight times higher — so high that Apte's equipment broke when he initially tried to measure it. Ultrafine particles have been studied less than other forms of pollution but are believed to be particularly hazardous.
Environmental consultant Ajay Ojha, who works on air quality in the western city of Pune outside of Mumbai, said it will take more work to show policy makers the risks of air pollution and how to address them.
"The problem is nobody owns air pollution. Nobody is individually responsible. So unless the public is demanding action, officials have no reason to even bring it up," he said. "... More understanding is needed before people will start to get upset."
Policy makers disagree about which sources of pollution are the most worrying, with car traffic, industries and power plants, trash burning and small businesses like brick kilns all vying for attention.
To Apte, that simply means there are lots of ways to start clearing the air.
"The good news about air pollution in Delhi is that there's a lot of really low-hanging fruit in terms of sectors that we can choose to target," he said.
He added that the U.S. and Europe began cleaning their skies only after incomes rose and people began to demand change: "I expect fully that we'll see the same thing in India."

Moody s has downgradedMoody's downgrades Japan to A1 from Aa3; outlook stable
 
Global Credit Research - 01 Dec 2014
Singapore, December 01, 2014 -- Moody's Investors Service today downgraded the Government of Japan's  debt rating by one notch to A1 from Aa3. The outlook is stable.
The key drivers for the downgrade are the following:
1. Heightened uncertainty over the achievability of fiscal deficit  reduction goals;
2. Uncertainty over the timing and effectiveness of growth enhancing  policy measures, against a background of deflationary pressures;  and
3. In consequence, increased risk of rising JGB yields and  reduced debt affordability over the medium term.
The A1 rating reflects the government's significant credit strengths,  including a large, diverse economy with a strong external position,  very high institutional strength and a very strong domestic funding base.
The stable outlook reflects the broad balance between upside risks including  significant fiscal consolidation and a resumption of economic growth,  and downside risks including intensification of deflationary pressures  and loss in economic momentum.
The rating action does not affect Japan's Aaa foreign currency,  local currency country and bank deposit ceilings. Those ceilings  act as a cap on ratings that can be assigned to the obligations of other  entities domiciled in the country.
RATINGS RATIONALE
RATIONALE FOR DOWNGRADE
DRIVER 1: HEIGHTENED UNCERTAINTY OVER REACHING FISCAL TARGETS AND  CONTAINING DEBT
The first driver for the downgrade of the Japan government's debt  rating to A1 is the rising uncertainty over whether the government's  medium-term deficit reduction goal is achievable, and whether  policy makers can overcome the tensions inherent in promoting growth while  simultaneously stabilizing and reversing the rising debt trajectory.
The Bank of Japan remains committed to monetary expansion, with  some positive impact on core CPI inflation. However, while  monetary expansion has boosted domestic aggregate demand to some extent,  the consumption tax increase on April 1 2014 has exerted even more powerful  downward pressure. At least in the short term, deficit reduction  is undermining the growth revitalization objective of Prime Minister Shinzo  Abe's economic policy strategy.
The government's response, to announce a delay in the second  step in the consumption tax increase, appears to represent a shift  in policy towards stemming re-emerging deflationary pressures on  economic growth and away from near-term fiscal deficit reduction.  This strategy could have merits. In our view, the government's  target of halving the primary deficit balance, excluding budgetary  interest payments, by fiscal 2015 from its fiscal 2010 level will  be difficult to achieve without more robust nominal GDP growth and hence  improved buoyancy in tax revenues. In their absence, reaching  the long-term target of a primary balance surplus by 2020 will  be even more challenging.
However, the strategy also poses risks to fiscal consolidation and,  over the longer-term, to debt affordability and sustainability.  Japan's deficits and debt remain very high, and fiscal consolidation  will become increasingly difficult to achieve as time passes given rising  government spending, particularly for social programs associated  with a rapidly ageing population.
The government acknowledges that additional but as yet unidentified economic  and fiscal reforms will be needed for Japan to achieve its primary balance  target in the second half of this decade. But the postponement  of the second stage of the increase in the consumption tax has resulted  in the delay of the 2015 budget, and a concrete plan to meet fiscal  targets is not likely to emerge until the second half of 2015.  The trajectory of government debt, projected at 245% of GDP  in 2014 according to the IMF, will only start to decline under the  most favorable combination of economic and fiscal reforms, including  tax and social security system reforms and total factor productivity improvements,  an end to deflation and achievement of annual nominal GDP growth of more  than 3.5%. Given current domestic circumstances and  lackluster external demand for Japan's exports, achieving  these conditions will be challenging.

The second driver for the downgrade is the rising uncertainty over the  government's ability to enhance medium term growth through structural  economic reform -- the third 'arrow' of Abenomics --  success in which will be crucial to achieve fiscal consolidation.  While some indicators suggest a pick-up in economic activity over  the past year, potential economic growth remains low.
GDP growth sharply contracted in the second quarter of this year following  the introduction on 1 April of the first step of the consumption tax increase,  to 8% from 5%. Output was also affected by adverse  weather in the summer to some extent. And both real and nominal  GDP contracted again in the third quarter of the year, putting Japan's  economy in recession for the third time since global financial crisis.
Moreover the relapse of the GDP deflator, the broadest measure of  price movements, into negative territory in the third quarter of  this year highlights the difficult nature of ending more than a decade  of deflation. Although the ratcheting up by the Bank of Japan of  its quantitative easing policies in October may once again move the deflator  back onto positive ground in the fourth quarter of 2014, the task  ahead for economic revitalization and price reflation is looking more  challenging than envisaged by Prime Minister Abe when he introduced his  three-arrow economic policy package in March 2013.
Looking further ahead, the most notable structural reform measure  to be implemented to date is a reduction in corporate taxation beginning  in fiscal 2015. The details have yet to be announced, and  the implications for business investment are therefore still unclear.  It is not yet clear what further measures the government will choose,  or be able, to take to address the deep-rooted structural  problems of Japan's economy, including broadening labor force  participation, enhancing corporate governance and dealing with the  challenges posed by demographic trends.
DRIVER 3: EROSION OF POLICY EFFECTIVENESS AND CREDIBILITY COULD  UNDERMINE DEBT AFFORDABILITY
The third driver for the downgrade is the potential implications of the  first two drivers for the affordability and sustainability of Japan's  huge debt load. Debt sustainability will rest on the continued  willingness of domestic investors to provide funding at affordable rates  for the government. This looks likely to remain the case as long  as investor confidence is not undermined. The JGB market has been  characterized by low and stable interest rates despite the exceptional  rise in debt since the 1990s. And JGB interest rates have remained  low and stable through a number of crisis episodes, including Japan's  1997-1998 financial crisis, the 2008 global financial crisis  and the 2011 tsunami and Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster.
Nonetheless, the Bank of Japan's efforts to raise inflation  to 2% may eventually put pressure on government bond yields and  thereby raise government borrowing costs. Rising interest rates  would increase expenditure and offset gains from revenue buoyancy.  Rising uncertainty regarding the government's capacity to deliver  on its policy objectives could raise yields without any commensurate rise  in revenues. Either outcome would further undermine the government's  ability to meet its fiscal deficit targets and reduce its debt burden  over the medium term, and eventually start to undermine debt sustainability.
RATIONALE FOR A1 RATING AND STABLE OUTLOOK
JAPAN'S CREDIT STRENGTHS SUPPORTED BY A DEEP DOMESTIC BOND MARKET,  STRONG INSTITUTIONS, LOW VULNERABILITY TO EXTERNAL SHOCKS
Whatever the challenges facing the government, Japan retains very  significant credit strengths. Its A1 rating and stable outlook  are supported by its large, diverse economy, which we characterize  as having 'High' economic strength. And even with the  very significant debt burden, we believe that Japan exhibits only  'Low' susceptibility to event risk. A marked home bias  on the part of resident investors provides a strong funding base —domestic  investors retain a marked preference for government bonds, which  has allowed fiscal deficits to be funded at the lowest nominal rates globally  over the past two decades. Private sector fiscal surpluses remain  more than adequate to fund government deficits, without the government  resorting to external funding. We believe that very high institutional  and structural strengths, including a decisive and powerful central  bank, currently sustain this funding advantage and are very unlikely  to diminish over the rating horizon.
Although Japan's government gross financing requirements are far  larger than other advanced country governments', contingent risks  which could elevate further such financing needs are low and remote.  Japan's banking and corporate sectors have restored their health  in recent years in terms of capitalization and deleveraging. Household  debt is at a moderate level and has remained stable over the past decade.  And despite low economic growth, Japan's labor market is relatively  sound in regard to key features, such as low unemployment level,  the recent pick-up in employment and nominal wages and a labor  force participation rate broadly comparable with other advanced economies.
Related to Japan's home bias is its strong external payments position,  which reflects the accumulated system-wide savings. At more  than 60% of GDP in 2013, Japan's net international  investment position is much larger than any advanced industrial G-20  economy, insulating its economy and capital market from global shocks.  Income earned from Japan's sizable external assets has helped to  sustain the current account surpluses, although this has diminished  owing to a shift into a trade deficit which is in large part driven by  the demand for energy imports following the shutdown in the nuclear power  industry after the 2011 tsunami and Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster.
WHAT COULD MOVE THE RATING DOWN / UP
While the stable outlook indicates that we believe the rating is well  positioned for the next twelve to eighteen months, factors that  could prompt a negative rating action include significant divergence from  the path toward achieving fiscal targets; an intensification of deflationary  pressures; a severe loss in economic momentum; or a shift in  the external current account surplus into persistent deficit.
Moody's would consider a positive rating action if Japan were to  implement policies that we concluded were likely to restore economic momentum  and improve prospects for significant fiscal consolidation and debt reduction.

5 Ways to Save Like a Nerd on Cyber Monday5 ways to save like a nerd on Cyber Monday
Ben Popken TODAY
Paul J. Richards / AFP - Getty Images
Shoppers check out a laptop at Best Buy after Thanksgiving during the pre-Christmas shopping melee.
When it comes to online shopping, geeks rule on Cyber Monday.
Brent Shelton is a shopping guru for FatWallet , a web forum where online shopping geeks team up and share tips on the latest coupons and secret deals almost as soon as they happen. He says there's a reason the pocket-protector set are apt to score on the Monday after Black Friday where retailers promote special online deals.
"Geeks and nerds are... connected to resources that will throw a deal over the top and do their homework," said Shelton. "They're willing to put in the time to nab the big deal." 
This comes in extra handy on Cyber Monday, the Monday after the Black Friday holiday shopping event. Retailers send out a blitz of deals, many of which can be so-so .
But with a little know-how you got from the geeks you can leverage those deals and win big at the check out. Here's five ways to save like a nerd on Cyber Monday.
Birchbox
A sample abandoned cart coupon code from Birchbox.
1. Abandon your shopping cart
Before CyberMonday, sign into your account at your favorite retailers and fill up your online shopping cart with stuff. Then... leave the site. A few hours or days later, check your email.
"The retailers will usually respond with a coupon to make the deal better," said Shelton. "Then use that coupon on Cyber Monday." It's not that sneaky, retail experts use these "cart abandonment" email campaigns make the stores more money than their usual email marketing, so they're happy to do them.
Stores known to do this include Bed Bath and Beyond, Birchbox, JCPenney, J. Jill, Kate Spade, Macy's, and Williams-Sonoma. 
2. Snag Twitter-exclusive coupons
Follow your favorite stores on Twitter and check in on Monday and Tuesday. Many stores now publish special coupons just for their social media followers.
3. Don't forget "Cyber Tuesday"
Check the social media feeds for the stores you're into again on early Tuesday morning after Cyber Monday. That's when most retailers "extend" their deals, said Shelton, and will re-promote things that didn't sell at even lower prices.
4. Follow the sites the nerds use
Set a forum topic alert in the FatWallet Hot Deals for what you're looking to snag. For instance, "4k UHD TV." Then you'll get an email right away when someone spots a deal. Set it to "immediate" because these can sell out in minutes. The cream of the deals will also hit the @FatWallet feed on Twitter.
Another site to follow is BFAds.net . "They are the screamers of Black Friday ad leaks, but they’re also very in-tune with Cyber Monday, especially the crazy good early deals and discounts," said Shelton. Their email list is worth signing up for to get notified about the latest deals as soon as they happen.
5. Score a cashback "multiball"
Sign up for cashback programs at places like FatWallet and Ebates , which are owned by the same company. Follow their affiliate links and you can get anywhere from 2 to 11 percent cash back. Then pay using a credit card that has its own cashback program to get an additional 2 percent or more back.
"I once stacked a 60% off with double cash back at 8%, got another 2% from my visa and spent enough to meet the free shipping threshold on enough clothes to cover all my nieces and nephews in one purchase," said Shelton. "Bam!"

one of the busiest daysOnline retailers are hoping that a spending frenzy will continue, with internet shopping reaching a pre-Christmas peak.
Dubbed Cyber Monday, some online stores offer discounts for consumers ramping up their Christmas shopping.
The first two Mondays of December tend to be the busiest online shopping days, after browsing over the weekend.
Cyber Monday comes after the frenzy of Black Friday offers - which some stores have carried over for a few more days.
However, some analysts say that shoppers are leaving their Christmas buying later.
This is the result of greater confidence in delivery services as retailers now rely so heavily on online sales.
Nigel Wilson, managing director of consumer insight at Experian Marketing Services, said that the pre-Christmas shopping peaks were "clearly identifiable".
Experian predicts consumers will spend £649.6m on 1 December, or £451,000 a minute - a 26% increase on Cyber Monday last year.
As the month goes on, online spending tends to be replaced by spending on the High Street for last-minute gifts and Christmas preparations. The busiest shopping day in stores is, according to Experian, on Boxing Day when traditional sales begin.
Staff tried to keep order at an Asda superstore in Wembley on Black Friday
Cyber Monday is seized on by retailers' marketing arms. The same is now true of Black Friday - which originated in the US. The discounts on offer prompted some frenzied scenes on Friday.
Police criticised management of some supermarkets after crowd surges and scuffles in scenes that officers in Greater Manchester described as "totally predictable".
Online retailer Amazon UK recorded orders for more than 5.5 million goods, with about 64 items sold per second - its busiest ever day .
Some online retailers reported problems with customers accessing their websites on Friday owing to demand.

IPL scam: Why should I ask Dhoni to quit  Srinivasan asksprint
Refusing to talk about Mahendra Singh Dhoni's role in his company India Cements, BCCI's President-in-exile N Srinivasan on Monday made it clear that the Indian captain would not be asked to resign despite questions about conflict of interest being raised against him.
Srinivasan, who is also the ICC Chairman, declined comments on the IPL spot-fixing scandal, which is being heard in the Supreme Court right now after Justice Mudgal Committee submitted its investigative report on the matter.
"The matter is in the court. I cannot speak on this," Srinivasan told reporters on the sidelines of an ICC function.
The Tamil Nadu strongman was even more curt when it came to answering questions on Dhoni, who is an employee of India Cements besides being the captain of the IPL franchise Chennai Super Kings -- owned by the company.
Supreme Court has made scathing comments on the issue of conflict of interest in the case of both Dhoni and Srinivasan.
"Why should I ask him to resign?" Srinivasan shot back when asked whether Dhoni would be asked to step down.
Asked what was Dhoni's role in India Cements, Srinivasan was once again curtly said, "Why should I tell you."
Srinivasan is under immense pressure to give up his position in the BCCI in the wake of the Mudgal Committee's observations on his role in the scandal.
The committee, while giving a clean chit to Srinivasan personally, has observed that the BCCI chief turned a blind eye to the wrongdoings in the league.

Much has been made of the fact that more than a million vinyl albums have been sold this year, but is that a lot, asks Anthony Reuben.
Everybody's becoming familiar with a particular story about how people buy their music. CDs killed vinyl. CDs were in turn at least partly killed by downloads. But then vinyl made a stirring recovery.
I heard a guest on BBC Radio 4 talk about how some people were buying vinyl as a form of art, with no intention of playing it. Clearly there are also lots of people who buy and play vinyl because they prefer it. But do the latest figures really herald a return to peak vinyl?
This year is the first time that more than a million vinyl albums have been sold since 1996. This was based on Official Charts data released by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), going back to 1994, which was when they started keeping count.
There was nothing particularly wrong with the figures, except that 1994 is quite a bad year to start looking at vinyl, as the graph above shows.
Now, there are caveats with these figures, which are for shipments not for sales. So if albums were sent by record labels to shops but not sold then they would still appear in these figures.
Also, they are figures for vinyl units, so a double album such as the Beatles White Album would count as two units.
But while these figures slightly inflate the number of vinyl albums sold, they make it clear that 1996 was not by any stretch of the imagination peak vinyl.
Compare vinyl shipments in 1975 and 2013. Well, in 1975, the era of Abba and the Eagles, 45 times more vinyl was shipped.

Migratory birds never win  TMC says about BJP president Amit ShahDec 01, 2014 at 06:56pm IST
Migratory birds never win, TMC says about BJP president Amit Shah

Kolkata: A day after BJP president Amit Shah gave a clarion call to uproot the ruling Trinamool Congress in 2016 Assembly polls from a rally, TMC on Monday held another procession saying 'migratory birds' never win.
"Those who come to Bengal as migratory birds, address a rally and go back to Delhi will never win here", said TMC MP and the chief minister's nephew Abhishek Banerjee, who was at the helm of the rally organised by the party's youth wing.
"Before the recent Assembly bypolls in the Chowringhee seat in Kolkata, TMC was trailing there by 1500 votes (in that Assembly segment of South Kolkata Lok Sabha seat in the general election) After Amit Shah campaigned, we won by 15000 votes", Abhishek said in the rally, which was seen as a show of strength of TMC after BJP's meet.
Parui area was recently in news for frequent clashes between supporters between Trinamool Congress and BJP.
#amit shah #bjp #tmc #kolkata
"Has the main speaker at BJP's rally yesterday talked of development, peace or communal harmony?" he asked.
The people of Bengal want peace and prosperity while BJP spent money to turn Parui in Birbhum district into Nandigram and failed, Abhishek, the national president of Trinamool Youth Congress said.
Parui area was recently in news for frequent clashes between supporters between Trinamool Congress and BJP.
"This year we won 34 out of 42 Lok Sabha seats in West Bengal. In 2016 we will win all the 294 seats in the Assembly," Abhishek said and warned that if Shah tried to take on Mamata Banerjee, he would face a thumping defeat.
Stating that "Mamataji wanted to know who Amit Shah is," the BJP chief yesterday said he was a small BJP worker who have come to uproot the 'corrupt' TMC regime from Bengal.
Abhishek said his aunt, who is the Chief Minister, was not going to rebut Shah as he is not of her stature. Banerjee did not attend today's meet but other top TMC leaders was at the rally.

The rupee ended largely steady on Monday after touching a near 9-1/2 month low, as dollar selling by exporters helped offset the weakness seen due to lower Asian currencies and global growth concerns. Sentiment also remained cautious ahead of the central bank's monetary policy review on Tuesday.

Tamir Rice and Michael Brown didnt deserve to dieBy Jonathan Capehart December 1 Follow @capehartj

Writing about how “in America, black children don’t get to be children,”  Stacey Patton, a senior enterprise reporter at the Chronicle of Higher Education, broke my heart in one paragraph. Not because I was shocked by what she wrote, but because I know she is right.
America does not extend the fundamental elements of childhood to black boys and girls. Black childhood is considered innately inferior, dangerous and indistinguishable from black adulthood. Black children are not afforded the same presumption of innocence as white children, especially in life-or-death situations.
The presumption of danger and guilt foisted on black boys and teenagers is enraging. What I wrote in July 2013 after a jury found George Zimmerman not guilty of killing Trayvon Martin, remains true in the wake of last week’s grand jury decision to not charge former Ferguson, Mo., police officer Darren Wilson for killing unarmed Michael Brown. Because of assumptions and suspicions, African American kids have to be “perfect” in how they dress and how they comport themselves in public at all times.
A family photo of Tamir Rice. (Associated Press)
Tamir Rice is among the litany of lost lives Patton details in her gripping op-ed. The video of his killing on Nov. 22 by Cleveland police officer Timothy Loehmann in a local park is startling not only because a child is killed but also by how quickly it happened. Just two seconds. The police cruiser had barely stopped and the cop was barely out of the car before he shot Tamir dead. A 911 call about “a guy in here with a pistol, pointing it at everybody” brought them to the park. The caller’s admonition that the gun is “probably fake” apparently never made it to the officers.
To make matters worse, Tamir wasn’t even thought of as a child. “Shots fired, male down, um, black male, maybe 20,” one of the officers said when calling in the shooting. Tamir was 12 years old. As Patton wrote, “Regardless of the case, the police officers’ actions in these cases are consistent and predictable: This was not a child. He was a threat. I was afraid and had to defend myself. The child, stripped of childhood, is framed as a menace that overrides probable cause.”
This impairment is not solely suffered by law enforcement. When the picture of a smiling 16-year-old Trayvon taken six months before his death in 2012 was released by his family, racists and others who should have known better peddled what they said was his “current picture.” That photo was of a then-31-year-old rapper named Game.
Even death provides no respite from society’s default negative judgment of young black men and boys. An injustice aided and abetted by their inability to tell their side of the story. They must have lived a life beyond reproach — one void of the bad choices and mistakes all teenagers make which teach life lessons and build character — for folks to not believe he or she deserved to die.
“I’m sure young Michael Brown is innocent and just misunderstood,” wrote Kansas City, Mo., police officer Marc Catron under a picture he posted on Facebook of a young man with a wad of money in his mouth and pointing a gun at the camera who resembled Brown. It wasn’t Brown. It was Joda Cain who stood accused of killing his great-grandmother in Oregon in 2013.

But Brown did shoplift cigarillos from a convenience store, video of which was provided unsolicited by the Ferguson police department after his death. In addition, Brown was described by Wilson in his grand jury testimony at various points as a “demon,” “aggravated,” “aggressive,” “angry,” “big,” “Hulk Hogan” and “bulking up to run through the shots, like it was making him mad that I’m shooting at him.” You’ll recall that an unarmed Trayvon walking back to his father’s girlfriend’s apartment from a convenience store was viewed as a “real suspicious guy” who was “up to no good” by Zimmerman. And in death, Trayvon’s adolescent bad choices were used to smear him, too.
“[N]o one knows our children like we do,” Lesley McSpadden, Brown’s mother, told Michael Skolnik , editor in chief of globalgrind.com, during an impromptu dinner in New York City over the weekend. I haven’t been able to stop thinking about that line since I read it.  Skolnik tells me that McSpadden was talking about them and their respective children. But I took it to be a lament of every parent of a black child. No one knows our African American children like we do. In America, black children are just that, children. It’s a damned shame people’s fears and prejudices blinds them to that fact. It’s a crying shame black kids must suffer because of it.

Why many voters of Kunan and Poshpora villages in Jammu and Kashmir will boycott electionsPriyarag Verma , IBNLive.com | Dec 01, 2014 at  10:10pm IST
Kunan (Kupwara): While campaigning for Jammu and Kashmir Assembly elections is on full force, there is an area where a group of voters have decided to boycott the democratic exercise not because they support the separatists leaders, but because they have been demanding justice for what they allege is one of the worst cases of human rights abuse and mass gangrape by the Indian Army.
Ever since Pakistan started to openly support, train, arm and finance terror groups in Jammu and Kashmir with the aim of snatching the state particularly the Valley from India, the region has become one of the most militarised areas of the world. With a huge presence of the Indian Army and Central paramilitary forces on one side and armed-to-the-teeth terrorists on the other, the common Kashmiri has simply become a pawn in the power game.
As terror groups gained strength and became deadlier, the armed forces too became more aggressive. With a clear mandate to crack down on terror groups and eliminate those wielding the gun and terrorizing people, the armed forces have also faced allegations of crossing the threshold, targeting innocent people, committing human rights violations and excesses leading to massive anger, resentment and hostility among the common and innocent people.
In 1991 troops of 4th Rajputana Rifles allegedly raped several women of the two villages. But the Army and government call the allegations baseless and fabricated.
One such case that has almost irreparably scarred the psyche of Kashmir is the allegation against Army soldiers of committing mass gangrape during a cordon and search operation in the twin villages of Kunan and Poshpora in Kupwara district of north Kashmir way back in 1991. According to the villagers of Kunan and Poshpora, soldiers of 4th Rajputana Rifles swooped down on their villages on the night of February 23, 1991, cordoned off the entire area, called out all the men, including boys as young as 10 years, pushed them towards the fields and also took some of them inside three houses in Kunan village which were turned into interrogation centres.
The women, young girls and small children left behind in their homes had no idea that their nightmare had only begun. According to the villagers, who have been fighting a case in the Kupwara court for almost 24 years now with no justice in sight, the soldiers then barged into their homes to target women and girls.
The Kunan Poshpora Coordination Committee, which was formed by the victims and their family members to pursue the case, alleges that the soldiers did not even spare girls as young as 12 while the oldest victim of the mass gangrape was a 90-year-old woman. Awaiting justice, she died a few years ago aged almost 105.
The petitioners claim that the troops raped several women although while filing the case they did not include the names of unmarried victims fearing for their future and keeping in mind the difficulties they were likely to face in getting married. The exact number of women who were raped that night is still not clear but ranges from 40 to as high as 100.
Not all villagers reported about the mass gangrape, fearing retribution from the Army, which has till now maintained innocence of its troops and called the allegations baseless and fabricated. Many were also wary of being ostracised by their relatives as rape is seen as loss of honour.
Ghulam Ahmed Dar, who heads the Kunan Poshpora Coordination Committee and was in his mid 40s when the atrocities took place, claims that the men were beaten up and tortured by the officers and a few soldiers of the raiding unit while the rest of the troops fanned out into the two villages raping their women and bringing dishonour to their village.
According to Dar, when the men returned to their homes next morning, they found their women cowering under beds and in cattle sheds while some of them were even found in the fields. All of them had their clothes torn, with many of them bleeding profusely from the brutal sexual assault. He also went on to claim that one of the victims died after five days due to excessive bleeding. Till date five victims have lost their lives even as the case has lingered on in a Kupwara court for over 24 years with the Army, Centre and state government denying that such an incident ever took place in Kunan and Poshpora.
Another Kunan Poshpora Coordination Committee member Javed Ahmad Shah alleged that they were pressured several times by the Army and local police to withdraw the case. But he maintained that he and other villagers would not rest till they get justice even it meant going all the way to the Supreme Court of India. Shah, who was not even born when the incident took place, says he is now representing his family after his grandfather and father became too old and could travel to Kupwara or Srinagar to pursue the case.
Shah dropped out of school after class 8 as at that time Kunan did not have any high school which was in the next village. The villagers said that their children are taunted and humiliated when they go to other villages or Kupwara. "People taunt us and say 'dekho Army ka baccha aaya hai' (See the son of Armyman has come). All of us faced the same thing. So it was better that we dropped out of school," said a bitter Shah.
Kunan and Poshpora come under Kupwara constituency and the second village has now been divided into two - Poshpora and Poshpora A. There are over 2000 voters in the area but over 500 of them which include the gang rape victims and their family members have been boycotting elections since the incident took place demanding justice and punishment to the alleged perpetrators.
Shah said they would sit outside the polling booths on December 2 with black flags against the mass gang rape incident and seek answers from the government and the Army for brushing aside their allegations under the carpet.

NEW YORK: Apple Inc shares tumbled shortly after the start of trading on Monday, briefly suffering their largest price drop in at least three months on an unusual spike in volume.
Selling accelerated just before 9:51 a.m. EST (1451 GMT), with more than 6.7 million shares trading in a one-minute stretch, the heaviest minute of trading in Apple since Oct. 29, according to Thomson Reuters data.
The stock lost over 3 per cent in that minute, falling as much as 6.4 per cent to $111.27. At mid-afternoon, it was down 3 per cent to $115.45.
The cause of the decline was not yet clear, though traders pointed to institutions using selling programs across a wide swath of stocks. Steve Hammer, a trading educator and founder of HFT Alert in Santa Barbara, California, which monitors algorithmic trading, said about 300 different stocks showed elevated price traffic beginning about 9:50 a.m. EST, a sign of institutions putting on sell programs.
"When you see that kind of price action that is simply algos running stocks," he said.
As of 2:05 p.m. EST (1905 GMT), more than 64 million Apple shares had traded, making it the most active issue in US markets.
A sharp price move coupled with high volume often prompts speculation about the influence of high frequency trading (HFT), when computer algorithms are used to trade stocks at an extremely rapid pace. HFT has been criticized for affecting the trading of stocks by sending in numerous trade quotes that slow quote activity - without filling the trades when shares fall.
"What that is called is evaporation of liquidity, liquidity that was never there in the first place and it's a typical maneuver that goes on in the fragmented stock market we have now," said Joseph Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.
However, determining the cause of the decline wasn't so simple. "The fact is we don't yet know what caused the drop, and blaming it on HFT is misleading," said Bill Harts, chief executive officer of Modern Markets Initiative, an advocate of high-speed electronic markets.
Similar declines on heavy volume, though not as dramatic, were seen in other stocks, including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd , which fell 1.4 per cent in one minute, and the S&P 500 tracking ETF, which had its busiest minute of trading on Monday at 9:51 a.m., when nearly 1.5 million shares traded.
At the day's low, Apple lost more than $40 billion in market value.
The recent ructions in the oil market were also cited as a potential catalyst for the selling in Apple. Traders said the need to free liquidity as oil and energy shares fell could have had an effect on other markets.
"Funds that suffered losses on their oil investments have to get out of their liquid securities in other sectors," said Sam Ginzburg, head of trading at First New York Securities in New York.
  Morgan Stanley strategists dropped Apple's weighting in their strategic portfolio to 3 per cent from 4 per cent in an equity outlook note released Monday, but traders said the swiftness of the decline was too dramatic to be attributed solely to the note, which was released before trading opened.
Saluzzi said "maybe it was the Morgan Stanley news that kind of stimulated the event," but not enough to cause such a decline.

It’s Cyber Monday — the day you’re supposed to be clicking and shopping. But you couldn’t tell from the faces of investors in many retail stocks today.
The SPDR S&P Retail exchange-traded fund, a basket of dozens of big retailers’ shares, is down $0.75, or 0.8%, to $92.71 Monday on widespread reports that Black Friday wasn’t as robust as investors hoped. And now with Cyber Monday kicking off — investors are wondering if this biggest day for online shopping might not measure up.
Eyes are closely affixed on online shopping leader Amazon.com (AMZN) , which so far is up $1.03, or 0.3% to $334.64 today. Seeing the industry leader up gives investors hope that retailers might be able to pull it out.
But overall, retail is not a great sector today which is disappointing coming off of Black Friday and going into Cyber Monday. The biggest retail stock loser among the broad Russell 1000 index Monday is struggling department store J.C. Penney (JCP) . Shares are down 2.4%. And rival Kohl’s (KSS) isn’t doing much better, falling 1.7%.
If there’s any big bright sign it’s Wal-Mart, which by all signs is faring well so far during the holiday season. Shares are up $1.26, or 1.5%, to $86.25.

Maoists gun down 13 CRPF personnel in Chhattisgarh  2 officers among the deadMaoist attack kills 14 CRPF personnel in Chhattisgarh

At least 14 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were killed and about a dozen wounded in an encounter with Maoists near Chintagufa in Chhattisgarh’s Sukma district on Monday, the biggest loss of lives in anti-Maoist operations after the NDA government assumed charge in May.
Security forces were deep inside the forests about 450 km from state capital Raipur, when Maoist gunmen attacked them, using villagers as shields, officials said. The CRPF launched a special operation on November 16 to corner the First Battalion of the CPI (Maoist)’s Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee who have a stronghold in the area.
"Fourteen jawans have died in the ambush," additional director general (anti-Maoist operation) Rajinder Kumar Vij told HT. The dead included two officers.
The death toll is likely to go up with security forces unable to carry out rescue operations in the firing that went on until late evening. “We have to wait till Tuesday morning to take out the injured personnel and the bodies from the remote forested terrain,” Vij added.
Union home minister Rajnath Singh, who will visit Chhattisgarh on Tuesday to assess the situation, condemned the attack, calling it a dastardly act of violence. “It is an act of cowardice,’ he said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi also tweeted about the incident: “Words are not enough to condemn the brutal and inhuman attack by anti-national elements in Sukma, Chhattisgarh.”

Around half a dozen CRPF personnel were wounded in another encounter in the same area on November 21 and insurgents also fired at an Indian Air Force (IAF) helicopter that had come to carry the wounded.
“When an IAF chopper came to pick the injured, it was also fired upon…  This time, when the encounter started in the morning, Maoists used villagers as human shields,” said a senior CRPF officer.
Maoist guerillas, claiming to fight for the rights of tribal communities and landless farmers, often engage in gunfights with government forces in the forested and hilly terrains of central and east India and have a presence in 16 of Chhattisgarh’s 27 districts, including Sukma.
The CRPF is also without a chief after former director general Dilip Trivedi retired on Sunday.
“Why this adhocism when daily operations are on against Maoists?” a counter-insurgency official said, requesting anonymity. “The government could have appointed Trivedi’s successor at least two weeks before his retirement so that he would have known where his men are fighting.”
Meanwhile, the security forces in Bastar zone have been put on high alert following the Maoist’s observation of Peoples Liberation of Guerrillas Army (PGLA) week from Tuesday (December 2-8).   

Modi government a  U-turn sarkar : CongressComments
The Congress on Monday termed the BJP-led government a “U-turn sarkar” for its “frequent flip-flop” on critical issues such as black money, Chinese incursions, Article 370 and “alliance with separatists” in Jammu and Kashmir during the past six months.
In its attempt to recover some of the ground it had lost in the Lok Sabha and recent state elections, the opposition party also released a 30-page booklet – 6 Maheene Paar U turn Sarkar -- in which it accused the BJP's of reneging on its poll promises and hijacking of UPA's schemes.
“This government has made 25 u-turns in the last around 180 days. That's an average of one u-turn every seven to eight days,” Congress general secretary Ajay Maken said, releasing the booklet the title of which sarcastically rhymes with the BJP’s catchphrase during Lok Sabha elections “Abki Baar, Modi Sarkar”.
He said the BJP walked into corridors of power with its “counterfeit vocabulary” riding on a wave of “corporate-funded” high voltage campaign based entirely on “false promises of change and baseless allegations”.
The Congress has repeatedly accused the BJP of having spent Rs. 10,000 crore on its publicity campaign in this summer’s Lok Sabha polls most of which came from the corporate houses.
Maken said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government have gone back on all its poll promises and virtually appropriated and renamed all UPA schemes.
“BJP government has been resorting to white lies on black money, flip-flop on issues with Pakistan, double standards on insurance bill and gross opportunism in aligning with NCP,” he said.
Though the booklet has mentioned the BJP’s u-turn on 22 issues, the Congress said the NDA government did somersaults on three more matters, including revealing the documents relating to Subhash Chandra Bose, civil nuclear liability act and the land boundary agreement with Bangladesh in the past few days.
“People, nation and Congress want to know whether the temptations of power had made you so blind that you opposed everything by the Congress-led government just to come to power,” Maken said.
The BJP was quick to hit back at the Congress, saying the panic-stricken opposition party has “trivialised” only to create some media space.
“Give us some time. Have some patience...Don't trivialize issues,” parliamentary affairs minister M Venkaiah Naidu said. “Decades of Congress rule left India in a very bad shape. To expect miraculous changes in just six months would be unjust.”

Apple stock deletes $18B in one day!Apple stock deletes $22.6B in one day!

Apple (AAPL) stock was supposed to completely destroy every retailer in its path this holiday season. But Apple is the one getting crushed Monday.
Shares of the gadget maker Monday closed down $3.86, or 3.3%, to $115.07. That might not sound like much of a decline, but when you’re talking about a stock worth upwards of $700 billion, it’s enormous. Investors lost $22.6 billion in stock value in one day.
The big drop in Apple’s value comes amid talk that the company might be the first to reach the $1 trillion valuation . Apple bulls think the stock can only go higher and that the laws of competition won’t apply, allowing the company to continue to charge $650 or more for smartphones even as competition heats up and new models of phones are increasingly comparable to the last.
It’s hard to decide why the stock is acting so badly during a time that all the bulls say it’s rocking. Here are three possible theories:
1. Cooling off after a meltup. Apple is the stock that everyone wants to talk about and own. There’s been such a pile on into the shares that the stock is up more than 40% this year — an enormous move for a stock this size. Given the magnitude of the move higher, it’s only natural to expect a decline.
2. Blasting past analysts targets. Apple’s stock is moving so fast that analysts’ 18-month targets keep melting away. Last week, the 18-month price target on Apple’s stock was $118 a share — creating an invisible ceiling for the stock. Analysts have since pushed their targets up higher to $120.31, says S&P Capital IQ, but the $118 level is still burned into some investors’ minds as a possible ceiling.

Ferguson protest leaders to meet with Obama at the White House MondayBy Wesley Lowery December 1 Follow @WesleyLowery

FERGUSON -- Several prominent Ferguson protest leaders will attend meetings at the White House with President Obama and other top administration officials Monday to discuss the ongoing tension in that city.
Obama will also meet Monday with young community leaders from Miami, New York City and Cleveland, where a 12-year-old boy holding a toy gun was shot and killed by a police officer last week, according to a person with direct knowledge of the meeting.
The meetings come as the president convenes a series of sessions with cabinet members, elected officials, and civil rights activists one week after a grand jury decided against charging Darren Wilson, a white Ferguson police officer, with a crime for the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown. And they take place as the Ferguson Commission – a body convened by Gov. Jay Nixon to probe systemic issues fueling the racial tension surrounding the shooting – meets for the first time later Monday in Missouri.
Monday will mark the second time that Ferguson activists have met with administration officials at the White House. In September, two protesters, a clergy member, and two local residents traveled to Washington to speak with White House aides.
Obama addressed the nation moments after the grand jury decision was announced last week, urging peace but also calling for a larger conversation about challenges often faced by communities of color when dealing with law enforcement.
Massive marches and protests are planned throughout Washington Monday, and activists in St. Louis have planned a protest at the Department of Justice building there.
Protest leaders have said they plan to push for legislation to require all officers to wear body cameras, as well as measures that would require all departments to report details of any officer-related shootings and that would make police personnel files public records, though they remain skeptical that these reforms will be enacted.
News of Monday's White House meetings drew mixed reaction from activists in Ferguson, many of whom had initially hoped for a visit from President Obama himself in the early days following the shooting. Attorney General Eric Holder traveled to the town instead.
Many of these activists had interpreted Holder's early comments about ensuring justice to mean that the Justice Department would bring civil rights charges against Wilson. A series of media reports has since revealed that civil rights charges against Wilson are viewed as highly unlikely.
“Where has [President Obama] been all of these months?" said one Ferguson activist Monday. "And now he wants to have a meeting? Please.”
Some of those who had attended the September meeting with the White House also remained skeptical of whether more meetings would yield real results.
“They told us they wanted to know how they could help,” said one attendee. “But after that they did nothing. They sent one email.”
 

RESOLVED: Comments sections need to goBy Chris Cillizza December 1 Follow @thefix
This person is probably writing a nasty online comment. REUTERS/Kacper Pempel/Files
As someone who has spent almost the entirety of the last decade writing online, I've dedicated vast amounts of time trying to find a way to make the comments section of The Fix the sort of edifying conversation I always imagined it could be. And I am here to report that, at least when it comes to politics, comments section are not now (and likely won't be any time soon) anywhere close to that ideal. In fact, eliminating comments entirely -- a prospect I have always blanched at -- may well be the best thing that could happen for the average reader of political news.
Consider this from WaPo columnist Anne Applebaum on the corrosive nature of commenting online :
Multiple experiments have shown that perceptions of an article, its writer or its subject can be profoundly shaped by anonymous online commentary, especially if it is harsh. One  group  of researchers  found that rude comments  “not only polarized readers, but they often changed a participant’s interpretation of the news story itself.” A digital analyst at Atlantic Media also discovered that people who read negative comments were more likely to judge that an article was of low quality and, regardless of the content, to doubt the truth of what it stated.
To combat that trend, Reuters recently got rid of comments on articles . "Much of the well-informed and articulate discussion around news, as well as criticism or praise for stories, has moved to social media and online forums," the editors wrote in explaining their decision. "Those communities offer vibrant conversation and, importantly, are self-policed by participants to keep on the fringes those who would abuse the privilege of commenting."  Vox, the site run by former WaPo-er Ezra Klein, doesn't have comments at all .   The New York Times heavily curates its comments section s.
It's easy to rebut the "get rid of comments" argument, of course. You are stifling free speech! You just don't like hearing people who disagree with you!  And so on and so forth.
Here's the thing: That's not why I think it's time comments sections on politics content should go away.  People tell me all the time why something I wrote, said or tweeted  is wrong: On Twitter, on Facebook and even in person.  And, I've never believed -- publicly or privately -- that I had a monopoly on good ideas or right answers. I LIKE people disagreeing with me and regularly ask for them to expand on their counter-arguments so that I can run them as a full Fix posts. ( Here's one example .)
My problem with the comment section is this: I think of the Fix as a community or a small city. In any community, there are a variety of views on just about everything.  The ability to voice those differing perspectives in a (mostly) civil manner is what makes a community -- whether it's online or offline --  great.
What the current configuration of comments sections does is allow the loudest person -- whether or not they are representative of the broader community -- to appoint himself (or herself) as mayor of the city. It's like if the most obnoxious guy on your block all of a sudden asserted his right to make all decisions related to the neighborhood for you.  Not so good, right?
The problem with this model is that while self-policing -- think of it as a sort of neighborhood watch for the online community -- can work, it becomes harder and harder to do the larger the community grows. In the early days of the Fix, a group of regular commenters -- some who liked my work, some who didn't -- banded together to keep the guy typing IN ALL CAPS ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ACTUAL POST from overrunning the site.  It worked -- for a while. But, as we added more writers and the traffic numbers grew, the ability of a small-ish number of commenters to police an increasingly large number of "loudest guys on the block" was reduced significantly. (To understand why self-policing fails: Try arguing with a five year old. You will NEVER win. Trust me. I do it all the time.)
Now, that's not to say that comments section across the Internet are pointless. I have long admired -- and been jealous of -- the comments section of Joel Achenbach's "Achenblog" -- a loyal, self policing community with Joel at its center. (A non-online analog for a successful community is Tony Kornheiser and his radio show -- of which I am lucky to be a part of.) I have seen comments -- on the WaPo site and off of it -- work really nicely when politics is not the subject. And, occasionally even on The Fix, the comments section functions as it should: An informed set of eyes and ears sharing wisdom on a particular subject. (My favorite of these is the user-generated list of best political reporters in every state .)
But, these moments are the exception not the rule in my experience. And it's not even close.
The best solution? Not to get rid of comments entirely. Instead, deploy an army of comment curators who harvest the best of the best for each article so that scrolling to the bottom of the page is rewarded. Unfortunately, given the amount of content that any news site produces in a given day, you would need hundreds of people to curate the comments. And that's not even getting into the sticky territory of what constitutes a "good" comment and who any news organization employs to curate comments.
Rather than use resources on people who try to make comments sections smarter, I'd rather do what the Post IS doing: Hire more content creators who can widen our community in ways that make more and more people want to be a part of it. That seems to me to be the way to be the best steward of our growing online city.  And the bigger the city grows, the harder it is to hear the loud guy screaming nonsensically down the block.  Win-win.

Fla. Dems cant win the governorship  so they want to change the rulesBy Reid Wilson December 1 Follow @postreid
Gov. Rick Scott is the third Republican in a row to win Florida’s top office. Now Democrats want to change the rules. (AP Photo/Naples Daily News, Scott McIntyre)
Update: The original version of this post misstated the number of times Democrats have won Florida’s electoral votes. Democrats have won the state in three of the last six presidential elections, not four.
In 1960, when Richard Nixon carried Florida’s 10 electoral votes, an unknown Republican gubernatorial candidate named George Petersen won just over 40 percent of the vote against Democrat Farris Bryant.
Democrats who controlled the state legislature were worried that holding their gubernatorial elections in presidential years, when more Republican voters showed up at the polls, threatened their solid grip on state politics.
So a group of rural segregationist Democrats called a special statewide election to change the year in which Florida elected its governors. Voters approved the change, shifting gubernatorial elections to midterm years, rather than presidential years.
Fast forward half a century, and the political calculus has changed: Now it’s Democratic voters who are more likely to turn up in a presidential year. Democrats have won Florida’s electoral votes in three of the last six presidential elections, but they find themselves in the midst of an historic gubernatorial losing streak.
Republicans have won five straight elections; Lawton Chiles was the last Democrat to win the governorship, in 1994.
Now, Democrats want to return to the old system. Party strategists are planning to collect signatures for a ballot initiative in 2016 that would shift governor’s races back to presidential election years.
“Our state leaders should be elected by the greatest number of people,” Ben Pollara, a Democratic strategist involved in the effort told the Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times , which first reported the campaign. “How can you argue that having fewer people participate in the political process is good for the state?”
Kevin Cate, the longtime Florida Democratic strategist, initially floated the idea of moving the election in an op-ed published a few weeks after Gov. Rick Scott (R) beat his candidate, Charlie Crist (D), in November.
Turnout in midterm elections routinely clocks in more than 10 points lower than presidential elections. Since 1996, presidential election turnout has topped 60 percent every year, while midterm turnout has hovered between 47 percent and 55 percent. Minorities and younger voters, two key pillars of the modern Democratic coalition, are far less likely to show up in midterm years.
(Of course, no one is preventing voters who decide not to participate in midterms from heading to the polls, and Democrats spent almost $20 million trying to get voters to the polls this year.)
But Democrats face a big hurdle in changing the state constitution. Florida law requires constitutional amendments to receive 60 percent of the vote to pass; even a medical marijuana initiative, which at one point enjoyed the support of more than 80 percent of voters in early polls, ultimately fell short of the 60 percent requirement.
And Republicans, once the target of the Democratic shenanigans, now have reason to stand by the current system. The last five elections have gone to Republicans Jeb Bush, Charlie Crist (a Republican when he was elected in 2006) and Rick Scott. The last time three Republicans won the governor’s mansion consecutively came between 1868 and 1874, in the aftermath of the Civil War.
Then again, the Democratic move to change the year in which gubernatorial elections were held didn’t exactly work in the first place: In 1966, the first year Florida held its governor’s race in the off year, Republican Claude Kirk bested Miami Mayor Robert High (D) to become the first Republican governor since Reconstruction.
Florida’s history should be a lesson to lawmakers on both sides seeking to change election laws to favor their candidates: Political tides change, and unintended consequences are almost certain to play havoc with even the best-laid plans.

Atheist Zombie Mohammed becomes Christian  complains about schoolteachers Star of DavidBy Eugene Volokh December 1 Follow @volokhc
Our readers might remember the Zombie Mohammed controversy . Atheist activist (Ernest Perce), who was marching as “Zombie Mohammed” in a Halloween parade (alongside a “Zombie Pope”), was attacked by an angry Muslim passerby, Talaag Elbayomy. When Elbayomy was prosecuted, Judge Mark Martin dismissed the charges, and berated Perce for his blasphemous behavior. Martin was eventually formally rebuked by Pennsylvania judicial authorities for this action.
But now Perce is back! He has apparently become an “Orthodox Christian,” and has filed a complaint against a Pennsylvania public school teacher for wearing a “Star of David” necklace. And the complaint, unfortunately, is legally quite plausible (at least assuming the necklace was a sign of religious adherence, and not just ethnic group membership), because the Pennsylvania Garb and Insignia Statute — 24 Pa. Stat. Ann. § 11-1112 (enacted 1895) — provides,
That no teacher in any public school shall wear in said school or while engaged in the performance of his duty as such teacher any dress, mark, emblem or insignia indicating the fact that such teacher is a member or adherent of any religious order, sect or denomination.
What’s more, U.S. v. Board of Ed. (3d Cir. 1990) rejected a constitutional challenge to the statute; Cooper v. Eugene School District No. 4J (Ore. 1986), appeal dismissed, 480 U.S. 942 (1987), likewise upheld a similar Oregon statute, though one limited to religious dress. (The Oregon Legislature repealed its statute in 2010 — over the objection of the ACLU of Oregon — but the Pennsylvania statute remains on the books.)
I think, though, that such statutes violate the Free Exercise Clause, because they discriminate against religious behavior; and, as I’ll note below, some recent cases so conclude. Religion-neutral statutes — for instance, that bar all jewelry worn by teachers, or set up a rigid dress code that excludes, say, all headgear, whether yarmulkes, headscarves, or anything else — would be judged under Title VII’s “reasonable accommodation” standard, and might or might not pass muster. But the Pennsylvania statute overtly and deliberately discriminates against religious behavior, and is thus unconstitutional. (I think the same of the former Oregon statute.)
The common argument in favor of such a law is that it prevents students from assuming that the school endorses religion; under modern Establishment Clause case law, government speech that endorses religion is generally unconstitutional. But such a law isn’t actually necessary to prevent such perceived endorsement, and should thus fail the strict scrutiny that is applied (under Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah (1993) ) to deliberate discrimination against religious practice.
First, a child who is old enough to realize that, say, a nun’s habit means that she’s a Catholic — or a teacher’s turban means that he’s a Sikh or a teacher’s Star of David means that he’s Jewish — will generally be old enough to recognize that people of many different religions may work at the same institution. It takes no great maturity or sophistication to recognize that the school’s willingness to hire a Catholic, Sikh, or Jew doesn’t mean that the school endorses Catholicism, Sikhism, or Judaism.
This would be especially true if the child sees other teachers who don’t wear such items, which would just reinforce the fact that the item is the teacher’s own choice, not the school’s. As a general matter, garments and jewelry aren’t interpreted by viewers, even young viewers, as attempts to persuade people of the truth of one’s faith. Indeed, all states but Pennsylvania let teachers wear religious jewelry, headgear, and the like, and I know of no evidence that students in those states are somehow perceiving this as an endorsement of religion on the school’s part.
Second, even if the court concludes that some very young students may interpret a teacher’s religious garb as the school’s endorsement of religion, or may be subtly coerced by seeing this garb on an authority figure, the case for this becomes much weaker for older students, and especially for high school students. Surely by the time one becomes a teenager, one realizes that the school may employ overtly Catholic teachers, overtly Jewish teachers, and overtly Muslim teachers without endorsing one or another religion. So the law is certainly overinclusive at least to teachers of older students.
Third, even if younger students may falsely assume that the teacher’s religion is endorsed by the school, the school may fulfill its interest in avoiding endorsement by dispelling this misconception, either directly or through the parents. “In America,” the school can say, “teachers and students belong to all sorts of religions, but their religions are their personal choices, not the school’s choice. Our school neither endorses nor condemns any teacher’s religious belief, which is why some teachers wear some kinds of clothes and jewelry and others wear other kinds.”
Even for young students, this is not a complicated lesson, and it’s likely a lesson that’s worth teaching. And teaching this lesson can be done without discriminating against religious practices, and without effectively excluding teachers who feel a motivation or an obligation to wear religious garb or jewelry — which brings us back to the point that the law isn’t necessary to serve the government interest in preventing endorsement or coercion.
Fortunately, Tenafly Eruv Ass’n, Inc. v. Borough of Tenafly (3d Cir. 2002) cast doubt on the U.S. v. Board of Ed. ruling, and the district court decision in Nichol v. Arin Intermediate Unit 28 (W.D. Pa. 2003) held — notwithstanding U.S. v. Board of Ed. — that the Pennsylvania Garb Statute is likely unconstitutional: “In the current legal landscape of the Establishment Clause, it is unlikely that the Garb Statute would withstand the heightened scrutiny and endorsement analysis to which it now must be subjected.”
And based on this ruling, the school district reportedly told Perce that it won’t order the teacher to stop wearing the symbol . The right result, though it’s too bad that the matter isn’t more legally clear.

Girl Scouts can now sell cookies online and ship them directly to your doorBy Abby Ohlheiser December 1 Follow @abbyohlheiser
Girl Scouts Bria and Shirell practice selling cookies on one of two new digital platforms. (Girl Scouts of the USA via AP)
The Girl Scouts of the United States of America added something new this week to a nearly 100-year-old tradition: Scouts will soon use the Internet to sell their cookies . And, crucially, they will ship those online orders directly to the buyers.
The cookie-selling program is designed to help troop members develop entrepreneurial skills — from setting goals and handling money to sharpening their sales and people skills — by selling and delivering the cookies themselves. The girls compete against each other, and with other troops, to sell the most cookies, with individual and troop-wide prizes available. Until now, that process has been strictly analog; online sales were banned by the organization.
Here’s how that will change: “Digital Cookie,” a platform recently approved by the organization, will allow Girl Scouts to sell cookies via a mobile and tablet app or a personal website starting in January. Troops have to opt-in to the online selling program for their cookie-selling drives.
The organization expects that as many as 1 million scouts — or about half of the girls who participate in the Girl Scouts — will use the online selling programs next year, the Associated Press reported .
But the new tools don’t allow Girl Scouts to simply set up a Web site, sit back and wait for the sales to come in. Each individual Girl Scout will have to initiate contact with a potential buyer; the personal cookie-selling sites are only accessible via emailed invitations. It’s a supplement, not a replacement, for the pen-and-paper spreadsheet sales that Girl Scouts (and their customers) know well.
The popular cookies sell for about $4 a box on average. Troop members traditionally make door-to-door sales (these days, with parents in tow), set up booths outside retail stores, or — controversially — send forms to their parents’ workplaces to sell as many cookies as possible. The online sales, the Girl Scouts hope, will become one of many strategies scouts use to learn about entrepreneurship

Occasionally, the national organization will step in and remind scouts — and their parents — that cookie sales are supposed to be educational endeavors. In 2012, the organization told the New York Times that it disapproves of parents selling cookies at work on behalf of their children. “Adults should not be selling cookies,” a representative told the paper. “We do want parents to help. We do not want parents to make the sale.”
That has also happened, in the past, with online sales. An 8-year-old named Wild Freeborn worked with her software-programmer dad in 2009 to set up an online sales portal for her own cookie drive — until the Girl Scouts stopped her, citing the ban.
Some local Girl Scout parents reportedly complained about Freeborn’s sales drive, which came complete with a promotional YouTube video.
At the time, the Girl Scouts told the “Today” show that the ban was in place until the organization could find a way to allow online sales in a manner that is “fair and equitable for all girls,” while remaining safe for the scouts.
Girl Scout cookie-selling began as early as 1917 in Oklahoma. Scouts used to bake their own cookies following a popular recipe, the organization explained; eventually, the program expanded to include the variety of cookies familiar to many today.
The record for sales in one season? It belongs to Katie Francis, an Oklahoma City Girl Scout who sold more than 21,000 boxes this year.

Twitter, a good medium to engage customers, say automakers
S Ronendra Singh
But, also exposes them to criticism
New Delhi, December 1:  
When Maruti Suzuki India launched a Twitter handle for its Swift model, the company wouldn’t have thought that the same medium will also expose it to consumer onslaught.
Recently, when Swift failed in a crash test, the handle, which was meant to promote the vehicle, became an outlet for consumer criticism. According to companies, the trend to use social media will only grow going forward as many customers want to get an update on what’s happening around the brand from the word ‘go.’
Brand association
Tata Motors did a three-day social bidding war, where six consumers battled it out to win a Tata Nano car by getting their followers to bid for them via tweets.
“The objective was to create brand association with the new Tata Nano Twist and its colour variants by positioning it as a possession that every 18-24 year should own,” a company spokesperson said.
“It’s important to connect with passionate people who are interested in your brand more than twice a day. Twitter gives that freedom of great frequency without making it look like intrusion,” explains Manohar Bhat, Vice-President – Marketing, Maruti.
All major automobile brands of the world have a strong presence on the platform, he said, adding that the company on the launch of the new Swift is running a Twitter campaign. The campaign has got 6,000 followers in just 21 days.
Target audience
A well tailored Twitter engagement in line with the campaign communication can give a product major push in terms of visibility — not just for the campaign but the brand at hand, said Jnaneswar Sen, Senior Vice-President — Marketing & Sales, Honda Cars India.
“Twitter allows us to broadcast our message to a target audience for fuelling on-line customer engagement. Post 2014, we will see a surge in all social media platforms delivering very sophisticated and advertising friendly tools/ products,” he said.
However, he also said there would be challenges to customise these tools/ products to suit a company’s campaign objectives or the brand voice at large.
On the negative feedbacks or criticisms, the companies said that while the idea was to use social media as a two-way communication platform between the brand and its customers, most customers use this media as a platform to complaint.
“Negative feedback is inherent to all marketing platforms. Social media gives the consumer the power to raise concerns directly. It’s important to take negative comments seriously and resolve customers’ issues to maintain the brand’s reputation as a customer friendly one,” says Bhat at MSIL.

Black Men Dont Need a Guardian Angel. Who We Need Is Our Guardian Slave.reddit
From 12 to 50 it's assumed we're packing, assumed that like the Hulk or zombies we possess superhuman, virtually unstoppable destructive power. So where an average citizen may disagree, even argue and berate a police officer , treating them as the public servant that they indeed are, a black man, if he wishes to continue living, must channel his ancestors. His slave ancestors. He needs to forget there is a black president and remember that the default position of cops, cop wannabes like George Zimmerman, and the population at large is to view him as a perpetual deadly threat.
Our slave ancestors understood this acutely. They understood that paddyrollers, the armed militias employed to ensure wandering slaves returned to their plantations, were all too willing to use lethal force. Every slave in the South knew to make no sudden movement, keep your head down, show your pass, mumble something deferential regardless of the inquisitor's uncivil tone and move along. That survivalist wisdom was passed along for generations as the role of the paddyroller was assumed more by local police officers than the Klan.
And I remembered that wisdom that was passed on to me by my grandfather and father every time I was followed by security guards through Toys R Us as a teenager in Hamden, CT, pulled over in my car in my twenties merely to check my ID in Palm Beach, FL, or stopped by a young cop to again show ID in my thirties in Santa Monica, CA.
Each time after the unreasonable stop I was left shaking and ashamed that I hadn't talked back, asserted my constitutional rights as an equal citizen under the law. But my inner guardian slave reminded me it wasn't worth it. That cop was armed with lethal force, a predisposition to see me as a threat, and a long-standing system behind him built to ensure that whatever he did to me would end without consequence.
In the 1970s, when I was first learning this lesson, the spilt blood of the Civil Rights movement was still fresh. Today, in a world of black presidents, electric cars and talking iPhones, it's so hard to convince young black men, like my 13-year-old son, that if a police officer merely perceives you are a lethal threat, he is explicitly allowed to shoot you dead. However, since the mere combination of your sex, race and age ensures that you are perceived as a threat, police officers are authorized to kill you Q.E.D.
So what I have to drill into him, since I want him to continue to live, is to listen to his Guardian Slave and be preternaturally polite and respectful no matter how ugly and unreasonable the policeman's demand.
Then at least he'll probably only be tased.

Thankful for Our Power: A Thankful Discourse in a Time of Reckoningreddit
Two days after the grand jury's decision not to indict Darren Wilson for the death of Michael Brown, there appears so little to be thankful for. Decades of overaggressive policing are all too common in all too many communities that some may want to give up.
Today, as we celebrate Thanksgiving, be encouraged that even in the midst of such profound sadness and darkness, there are still glimmers of hope and things worthy of gratitude: We can be grateful for the young activists of yesterday and today, our country's ability to transform for the better and our own capacity to effect meaningful change.
Reports of fires, looting and civil unrest in cities across the country have dominated the conversation. But what has not been amplified are the peaceful protests led by young practitioners of democracy.  These young activists transformed an individual incident in police brutality into a global call for social justice. Peaceful, nonviolent protest is part and parcel of our American tradition -- from Selma to Montgomery to Occupy Wall Street. And in each of these instances, our young people have stepped up and stood on the front lines for justice. For each of them, we can be grateful.
We can be hopeful in our country's ability to change for the better. While we have overwhelming work to do in reforming our criminal justice system, we have made some inroads.
We are hopefully nearing the crest of a rising tide where there is increased national awareness and a shift in public opinion about the immorality and unconstitutionality of racial profiling as a viable police strategy and tactic. Now, we at the NAACP know about racial reform. We were founded to combat a form of racialized police brutality known as lynching, which was often done by law enforcement officials, aided by mobs. Between 1862 and 1968, as many as 3,346 black men and women were lynched .  We helped bring that practice to an end. We can yet do the same for racial profiling and police brutality.  And we are encouraged that today there is a growing consensus of researchers who invalidate racial profiling, citing that it engenders community distrust, makes prosecutions more difficult and makes both communities and police officers less safe.
However, we must still stand firm on advocating for a federal standard on the excessive use of force, both federal and state anti-racial-profiling laws and the elimination of other laws that criminalize our black and brown communities, like  the "Three Strikes, You're Out" law and laws that overincarcerate drug offenders.
And for this reason we must be most grateful for and never lose sight of our own ability to effect change -- change in our communities, change in our country and change around the world.
Michael Brown's death is a moment none of us would have sought. However, his death and the death of so many other black and brown brothers and sisters at the hands of police misconduct has served as the catalyst to bring to the forefront the need to end racial profiling and police brutality.
And on Saturday, Nov. 29, the NAACP, including members of our Youth and College division and senior and youth organizations, will continue this work by embarking on a 120-mile, seven-day march titled " Journey for Justice: Ferguson to Jefferson City ." The march will commence on Nov. 29 near Michael Brown's home and conclude at Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon's governor's mansion in Jefferson City.
This march is the first of many demonstrations to make clear to the country and the world that the NAACP and our allies will not stand down until systemic change, accountability and justice in cases of police misconduct are served for Michael Brown and the countless other men and women who lost their lives to such police misconduct.
This Thanksgiving, we need not underestimate ourselves. There is much to be grateful for even now. We must be thankful that our power is evident -- in the voices of young and older protesters, in the marchers of the civil rights era, in the lawyers fighting for the rights of the oppressed and for those joining us this Saturday on our 120-mile journey.  We will not cower, and we will not capitulate. We will continue to demonstrate our power with both grace and vehemence. We believe in our young people and in the value of their lives, and we will bring police brutality to an end.

BEIRUT (AP) — The Islamic State group launched an attack Saturday on the Syrian border town of Kobani from Turkey, a Kurdish official and activists said, although Turkey denied that the fighters had used its territory for the raid.
The assault began when a suicide bomber driving an armored vehicle detonated his explosives on the border crossing between Kobani and Turkey, said the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and Nawaf Khalil, a spokesman for Syria's powerful Kurdish Democratic Union Party.
The Islamic State group "used to attack the town from three sides," Khalil said. "Today, they are attacking from four sides."
Turkey, while previously backing the Syrian rebels fighting to topple President Bashar Assad in that country's civil war, has been hesitant to aid them in Kobani because it fears that could stoke Kurdish ambitions for an independent state.
A Turkish government statement on Saturday confirmed that one of the suicide attacks involved a bomb-loaded vehicle that detonated on the Syrian side of the border. But it denied that the vehicle had crossed into Kobani through Turkey, which would be a first for the extremist fighters.
"Claims that the vehicle reached the border gate by crossing through Turkish soil are a lie," read the statement released from the government press office at the border town of Suruc. "Contrary to certain claims, no Turkish official has made any statement claiming that the bomb-loaded vehicle had crossed in from Turkey."
"The security forces who are on alert in the border region have ...  taken all necessary measures," the statement continued.
Associated Press journalists saw thick black smoke rise over Kobani during the attack. The sound of heavy gunfire echoed through the surrounding hills as armored vehicles took up positions on the border. The Observatory said heavy fighting also took place southwest of the town where the Islamic State group brought in tanks to reinforce their fighters.
Video from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights purporting to show ISIS militants firing from inside Turkish territory:
Mustafa Bali, a Kobani-based activist, said by telephone that Islamic State group fighters have taken positions in the grain silos on the Turkish side of the border and from there are launching attacks toward the border crossing point. He added that the U.S.-led coalition launched an airstrike Saturday morning on the eastern side of the town.
"It is now clear that Turkey is openly cooperating with Daesh," Bali said, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. Later in the day, he said the situation was relatively calm on the border after a day of heavy clashes.
The Islamic State group claimed three suicide attacks in Kobani's border crossing point, the SITE Intelligence Group reported. The group, quoting Twitter accounts linked to the militants, said the suicide attacks were carried out by a Saudi and a Turkmen, adding that one of them was driving a Humvee.
The Islamic State group began its Kobani offensive in mid-September, capturing parts of the town as well as dozens of nearby villages. The town later became the focus of airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition against the militants.
Kurdish fighters slowly have been advancing in Kobani since late October, when dozens of well-armed Iraqi peshmerga fighters joined fellow Syrian Kurds in the battles. The fighting has killed hundreds of fighters on both sides over the past two months.
The Observatory said Saturday the latest fighting killed at least eight Kurdish fighters and 17 jihadis.
Syria's Foreign Minister said in a television interview aired Friday night that the U.S.-led coalition's weeks of airstrikes against militants in Syria had not weakened the Islamic State group. Washington and the U.N. Security Council "should force Turkey to tighten control" of its border in order to help defeat militants, he added.
"Is Daesh today, after two months of coalition airstrikes, weaker? All indications show that it is not weaker," al-Moallem told Beirut-based Al-Mayadeen TV.
The Islamic State group has declared a self-styled Islamic caliphate in areas under its control in Iraq and Syria, governing it according to its violent interpretation of Shariah law. The group has carried out mass killings targeting government security forces, ethnic minorities and others against it.
Associated Press writer Suzan Fraser contributed to this report from Ankara, Turkey.

The  Wisdom of Friends  Powers Brand Advocacyreddit
We are hearing so much now about social media creating a shift from "the wisdom of crowds" to "the wisdom of friends," but what does that really mean for brand advocacy? A lot. It's this "wisdom of friends" that brings a new "social power" to Brand Advocacy.
Social power (the ability to influence) used to be determined by who had the most money, or was the most intelligent, or was the most effective at impressing their will on others, but that's changing thanks to social media. Now social power comes through connections of friends, or the "wisdom" of friends, so advocates have much greater influence.
Numbers still hold some power, and they always will, but the strength of connection is becoming even more powerful.  Consumers care about reviews, evaluations and what other consumers say about your product, much more than advertisements... and that is great for a brand.  What they care about even more is what their friends think about your product.  One or two friends' opinions -- the "wisdom of friends" - carry more weight than many other opinions combined.
Bring Brand Advocates into the equation, and you see the power here.  An Advocate is so impressed by your brand or product that they can't wait to tell their friends about their experience... and because of this trend toward 'wisdom of friends,' their friends are primed to pay attention to those recommendations.  Friends immediately trust their friends who are Advocates, purchase the recommended product, and if that experience is everything they hoped for (and it likely will be, since advocates won't be excited about anything less), a new Advocate is born and the cycle continues.
Since your Brand Advocates are seeing an increase in their social power, this means your brand itself now has more power to influence. And the more social power your brand has, the more Advocates it will create.  It's a mutually-beneficial relationship circle, all built on this 'power of friends."
Advocates are an incredible asset, now more than ever, treat them as such.

In the Trenches on Black Fridayreddit
Out the door at 6:36 a.m. on a rainy (what else) Seattle morning, I was already late for the Black Friday sales. Close on 24 hours late. What used to be a one-day post-Thanksgiving Day ritual has snuck forward in recent years to form what the media are calling "Gray Thursday". Online "Black Friday" sales started days or even weeks earlier. Just like we've experienced "Christmas creep" with the "silly selling season" starting in September, retailers went as early as they dared to get the jump on competitors.
Black Friday broke borders too. BBC News reported that Amazon UK had its busiest day ever this year after introducing the concept on that side of the pond in 2010. Brazilian shoppers took part in their own version of Black Friday too, even though, as the LA Times noted , "they don't celebrate Thanksgiving and don't have the day off on Friday".
Back in Seattle at the local Target, a girl on the checkout told me she had worked all day on Thanksgiving at the Seattle Premium Outlets, then backed up to man the till at Target from 10 p.m. to 8 a.m. At Marshalls (an off-price retailer), a bleary-eyed sales associate on the register said she had shopped till she (literally) dropped on Thanksgiving evening -- hitting the hay at 2:30 a.m.
When I turned up around 7 a.m. at the local group of big box stores, the car park was two-thirds full, and shoppers were cruising the aisles like sharks, on the hunt for bargains. Toys were popular, as was technology. This was a strictly take-no-prisoners affair though. One burly male shopper was busily checking his smartphone to ensure that the $800 large-screen TV was indeed a deal at $200 off. "Barely worth buying", he sniffed, when I asked what he thought.
Some stores were busier than others. Target was busy-ish, with sale dump-bins half-empty after overnight trading, and buyers picking over the remnants like the carcass of a Thanksgiving turkey. At Petco, you could have fired a cannon through the store and not hit anyone. Obviously pets and their owners were not all that excited by the prospect of hitting the sales early and picking up a "bargain bone".
Just before 8 a.m. electronics store Best Buy was on the brink of its second Black Friday opening in 15 hours. The store had welcomed shoppers on Thanksgiving from 5 p.m. to 1 a.m., then closed to re-stock, and opened again at 8am on Black Friday itself. The "double dip" approach seemed to have worked. A well-ordered line stretched along the front of the store, under the awning of the next-door retailer, and two police cars were there to control the "crowds" (or maybe just keep an eye on theft).
When the clock ticked over past eight o'clock, shoppers surged in, nabbing the best bargains. I counted 60 x 32 inch LED TV's stacked up, ready to be carted away. One man was dragging a monster carton housing an enormous TV towards the register. Our ancestors felled sabre-tooth tigers. The modern hunter nabs a different kind of beast.
The real doorbusters had disappeared hours before of course. The shelves at Best Buy were clear of Beats by Dr. Dre headphones at $80 each -- down from $170. But hopeful shoppers were still roaming the store, catalogs clutched in one hand, smartphones in the other, seeing what was left.
As I write this, Black Friday has ticked over to Saturday, but the sales events continue. Today is "Small Business Saturday" (an American Express promotion supporting owner-operators), and then comes "Cyber Monday" (the big online sales day) and "Giving Tuesday" (supporting charities).
Only Sunday escapes without a retail handle. But you can bet your bottom dollar it won't be a day of rest for retailers. The relentless run continues towards Christmas and beyond, as merchants race to extract as many dollars from consumers as possible and keep their stakeholders happy.

I used to travel in search of music: Shantanu Moitramusic
Music director Shantanu Moitra says he used to travel across India in search of music.
Shantanu, who began his musical career composing jingles in advertisements, has penned his debut book in English titled- ‘On the Wings of Music.’
The composer said his first such travel was while he was still a fresher in college to Jaisalmer from Delhi, where he grew up, to listen to Ravanhatta, a little-known string instrument.
“I had heard it but once at a cultural festival in Delhi and was completely mesmerised by its sound,” he said.
His mysterious encounter with a chained dacoit, who played the Ravanhatta for him, in the dead of the night in the pitch dark railway station is the first anecdote in the book.
“I am pulled by the fact that there is a whole big world out there... I have moved around extensively in off beat places. I have realised that what governs the world is love,” Moitra, whose latest musical venture is upcoming Aamir Khan starrer ‘PK’.
“Travels liberate me from the grind of big cities like Mumbai.... The journeys have blurred the lines between home and the world and I get the glimpse of the meaning of vasudhaiva kutumbakam.”
— Shantanu moitra (@shantanumoitra) November 28, 2014
Shantanu said he is also a mountaineer, a cook and a writer.
He also has an interest in photography in equal measure.
“I live life for the moment. Music is a small part of my life, travelling and mountaineering are my passions,” said the man who shot to fame with his composition for ‘Parineeta’, and followed it up with films like ‘Lage Raho Munnabhai’, ‘3 Idiots’ and ‘Madras Cafe’.
Shantanu said he was initially reluctant to relocate to Mumbai from Delhi where he had grown up. “I think it was my frank declaration of my feelings that intrigued Javed Akhtar, who had first asked me.”
‘On the Wings of Music’ is a collection of 28 anecdotes, reminiscences and self revelation charting the growth of a timid, diffident and self-effacing boy to a music composer of international repute.
The book, second by the musician after his Bengali work ‘Pherari Mon’, is written in an autobiographical vein with his ebullience and sense of adventure coming through in each anecdote.
Shantanu said the book was written to fulfil the demands of his friends after the success of his first one. The spark to write was ignited by Gulzar, who had cleared his doubts about his ability.
His love for cooking and travelling is contained in his anecdote on the visit to Kazakhstan where he had gone to participate in the world folk and pop meet and during a visit to a high altitude desert there cooked for an Australian group.
Among the anecdotes in his new book are the passion about astronomy that he and Gulzar shares, his becoming a professional composer in ‘Parineeta’ from a rookie, relation with Bharat Ratna Bhupen Hazarika, whose last recorded song was composed by him and his vibes with Javed Akhtar.

Asia Factories Find Demand Lacking, in Further Blow to Commodities
Reuters | Updated On: December 01, 2014 11:39 (IST)
Fed Faces Big Decision Over a Few Choice Words
Sydney: Asia's factories appeared to have stepped down a gear last month as a glut of supply met a dearth of global demand, piling pressure on prices of manufactured goods and the commodities used to make them.
Oil sank to its lowest in over five years on Monday, with the industrial bellwether copper not far behind. The rout spread to gold and silver while the US dollar cleared seven-year peaks on the Japanese yen.
Both US crude and Brent have now fallen for five straight months, the longest losing streak since the 2008 financial crisis.
With domestic and export demand softening and production growth weak, many Asian manufacturers were more reluctant to stock up on raw materials, activity surveys on Monday.
While lower commodity prices are a boon to consumer spending power, they have damaging side effects in a world where official interest rates are already at historic lows in many countries.
Slowing inflation acts as an unwanted tightening of policy as it pushes up real interest rates, one reason China and Japan surprised with new stimulus measures in recent weeks.
It was clear in HSBC's survey of Chinese businesses which found input costs fell for a fourth straight month in November while its overall index of activity touched a six-month trough of 50.0.
China's official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was scarcely better, slipping to 50.3 in November from October's 50.8.
"Domestic demand expanded at a sluggish pace while new export order growth eased to a five-month low. Disinflationary pressures remain strong while the labour market weakened further," said Hongbin Qu, chief economist for China and co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC.
"We continue to expect further monetary and fiscal easing measures to offset downside risks to growth."
After saying for months that China does not need any big economic stimulus, the central bank wrong footed markets by lowering rates in late November.
China's troubles were felt broadly across the region, with South Korea reporting exports to the Asian giant fell for the first time in three months, while its measure of manufacturing activity stayed stuck in contractionary territory.
In Indonesia, the HSBC Markit PMI reached the unwelcome milestone of the lowest since the survey began in April 2011 at 48.0. That was down from 49.2 in October.
In Japan, the Markit/JMMA version of the PMI eased to 52.0 in November, from 52.4 the month before. The economy slipped into recession in the third quarter as the baleful impact of a hike in sales taxes lingered longer than anyone expected.
Still, the extent of the contraction may have been overstated, given figures out Monday showed business investment was stronger than thought.
India was a rare bright spot, as it has been for a few months now, with its PMI climbing to a 21-month high of 53.3 last month.
A host of European and US surveys are yet to come on Monday. The euro zone measure is expected to be barely positive at 50.4, woefully short of the US ISM which is forecast to come in at 58.0.
The European Central Bank releases its latest economic estimates this week when inflation is back at a five-year low, adding to the case for more aggressive stimulus in the bloc.

Army of Amazon robots ready to help fulfill orders on Cyber MondayArmy of Amazon robots ready to help fulfill orders on Cyber Monday

Amazon rolls out its Kiva robots.
Amazon is increasingly using robots to help fulfill customer orders at its warehouses
Amazon's robots carry stacks of merchandise to workers, eliminating the need to walk through aisles of goods
This holiday season, Amazon's little helper is an orange, 320-pound robot called Kiva.
The robots -- more than 15,000 of them companywide -- are part of Amazon's high-tech effort to get orders to customers faster. By lifting shelves of Amazon products off the ground and speedily delivering them to employee stations, the robots dramatically reduce the time it takes for workers to find items and put them into boxes for shipment. 
On the eve of Cyber Monday, Amazon's year-old warehouse in Tracy, Calif., was buzzing with activity as the retailer prepared for one of the biggest shopping days of the year.

Kiva robots zoomed around the floor with uncanny precision, hoisting shelves containing video games, coloring books and stuffed animals. Yellow bins filled with merchandise zipped by on conveyor belts. A group of employees, some sporting red Santa hats, spent their break doing a series of arm stretches.

Since acquiring robot-maker Kiva, a Massachusetts company, for $775 million in cash in 2012, the e-commerce retailer has been increasingly implementing automation at its gargantuan fulfillment centers. Kivas, which resemble overgrown Roombas, are capable of lifting as much as 750 pounds and glide across Amazon's warehouse floors by following rows of sensors.
Sunday was the first time Amazon publicly unveiled the Tracy warehouse, which boasts the company's latest "eighth-generation" fulfillment center technology, including 3,000 Kivas. Ten Amazon warehouses, including two in California, are classified as eighth-generation; Amazon now has 109 fulfillment centers globally.
Dave Clark, Amazon's senior vice president of worldwide operations and customer service, said that because Kiva-equipped facilities eliminate the need for wide aisles for humans to walk down, eighth-generation centers can hold 50% more inventory than older warehouses. More storage capacity means a wider selection of merchandise, fewer chances of products being out of stock and more possibilities for same-day delivery, he said. 
"It's sort of a virtuous cycle," he said during a tour of the facility. The robots, he added, have also cut processing times for orders to as little as 13 minutes from well over an hour.

The Tracy center, which is more than 1 million square feet in size and has 1,500 full-time employees, is still not at full capacity. It currently houses 21.5 million items (3.5 million unique SKUs), with plans to increase that number to as much as 27 million items next year. On a peak day -- such as Cyber Monday -- the warehouse ships 700,000 items.
Seattle-based Amazon has been adding new technology to many of its fulfillment centers. Some warehouses utilize Robo-Stow, a 6-ton robot that moves merchandise pallets as high as 24 feet directly onto Kiva robots, and "vision systems" that can receive an entire trailer of inventory in as little as 30 minutes by capturing an image of the trailer's contents.
Workers at the Tracy facility said they enjoyed the ease of Kiva robots bringing products directly to them, though some conceded they missed walking the former maze of aisles to find products.
Clark declined to discuss the cost of each robot, or how much Amazon spent building the Tracy warehouse. But he noted, "we're very happy with the economics."
He said increased automation hasn't led to reduced staffing levels at newer warehouses because the company continues to grow rapidly.
"That growth is driving increased hiring. We continue to add employees, and no employee has been negatively impacted by Kiva coming on board," he said. "What we've done is automate the walking element. Our focus on automation is to do automation that helps employees do their job in an easier way, in a more efficient manner."
This holiday season Amazon announced it was hiring 80,000 seasonal employees, 14% more than last year. The company has projected online sales during the fourth quarter to increase 7% to 18% when compared with the same quarter last year.
Last year, Amazon announced that it sold nearly 37 million items on Cyber Monday, or 426 items a second. The company is expecting bigger sales this year and will probably report figures Tuesday.

Amit Shah s name in Sahara chiefs red diary: TrinamoolNew Delhi, December 1, 2014
Updated: December 2, 2014 03:03 IST
Trinamool, BJP clash in House
National Bureau
parliament
Members of the Trinamool Congress and the BJP targeted each other in Parliament on Monday leading to clashes and walkouts.
The Trinamool MPs staged a walkout from the Lok Sabha after Speaker Sumitra Mahajan did not accept their demand for suspension of Question Hour. The MPs, carrying red diaries with “Sahara” written on it, earlier stormed into the well of the House and raised slogans. They want to know a name that had come up during a CBI probe against the Sahara group.
In the Rajya Sabha, Trinamool member Derek O’Brien sought to raise the issue during Zero Hour and Question Hour, but was not allowed. As he rose to raise the matter, the BJP members attempted to shout him down by raising the Saradha scam.
Clash over Saradha, Sahara
With the Trinamool Congress demanding in the Lok Sabha on Monday that a name that had come up during a CBI investigation against the Sahara group be revealed, Parliamentary Affairs Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu said rules did not permit any member naming anyone who was not a member of the House.
Some members referred to a top BJP functionary while raising protests, and said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should give details of the action taken by the CBI after the name allegedly figured in the diary.
The war of words between the BJP and the Trinamool escalated after Kirit Somaiya of the former raised the Saradha chit fund scam, and alleged that the West Bengal government was not cooperating with the CBI in the case.
His remarks drew sharp protests from the Trinamool members, forcing the Speaker to adjourn the House for lunch.
In the Rajya Sabha, Trinamool member Derek O’Brien sought to raise the issue during Zero Hour and Question Hour, but was not allowed. As he rose to raise the matter, the BJP members attempted to shout him down by raising the Saradha scam. The Trinamool members later staged a walkout.
Reacting to the charges outside Parliament, the BJP said the Trinamool was rattled by the success of its recent rally in Kolkata. “The Trinamool is frustrated, perturbed and disturbed and is making false and baseless allegations,” the party’s national secretary, Shrikant Sharma, said.
Earlier, referring to the red diaries, the Parliamentary Affairs Minister said, “If the TMC is coming close to red (Left parties), we have no problem.”
“If the party has something substantial it should come out with it instead of making baseless allegations against the BJP president.”

The Do s and Don ts of Holiday SpendingThe do's and don'ts of holiday spending

Shoppers and pedestrians cross 34th Street outside of Macy's Herald Square department store during the Christmas shopping season.
It’s not too hard to understand why many parents quickly go overbudget during the holidays.
“When you ask children what they want for Christmas, most kids want expensive gifts.” Sheri Moskowitz Noga, author of “Have the Guts to Do it Right: Raising Grateful and Responsible Children in an Era of Indulgence,” is well aware of how easy it is for parents to overspend. “Parents want gratification by making their children happy.”
The National Retail Federation has predicted that families will spend $596.53 on holiday gifts this year, said spokeswoman Kathy Grannis.
How do the experts suggest families avoid overspending in 2014? Here are a few do’s and don’ts to help you keep your spending on track.
DO: Start your holiday season with a family meeting
Dr. Laura Markham, author of “Peaceful Parent, Happy Kids: How to Stop Yelling and Start Connecting,” suggests that parents call a family meeting at the beginning of December and ask everyone what they want to do to make their holiday season meaningful.
Writing everything down, even when a child asks for something outside the budget, helps children feel heard and that their holiday expectations matter—even if you can’t meet every expectation. Likewise, including the entire family in the planning and budgeting discussion teaches children important lessons in managing both money and time.
Video: A new study reveals that your best bet for shopping for gifts is the Monday before Thanksgiving, not Black Friday.
DO: Make a budget that includes everything from gifts to carpet cleaning
Kimberlee Stokes, parent and blogger at The Peaceful Mom , created a Holiday Spending Planner that includes budget planning categories for everything from plane tickets to wrapping paper to carpet cleaning.
Kimberlee Stokes / ThePeacefulMom.com
Stokes's holiday budget planner.
“I had a couple of rough Januaries because I overspent the previous November and December,” Stokes said. She made her budget tool to prevent this type of overspending in the future.
Stokes developed the Holiday Spending Planner by looking at her previous spending patterns. “I took my receipts that first year, and everything that I had spent I tried to place in a category.” She also talked to her friends to learn how they spent their money over the holidays. “The cleaning the carpets category: I don’t do that, but several of my friends did,” she said.
The more you plan for every possible expense, the better you can prepare for your holiday spending.
DO: Adjust your spending to accommodate unexpected expenses
When unexpected expenses come up—and they will—Stokes suggests that parents adjust spending within categories instead of raising the overall budget.
“If you forget that you have to get a gift for your boss, and you want to just go out and spend the money, take the time to go back, look at the budget, rework the numbers, and decide where that money will come from,” said Stokes.
This way, Stokes said, parents don’t find themselves in debt come January, or without enough money to pay the bills.
DO: Make gift-giving creative, not expensive
Todd Hebert, a Portland, Maine parent who blogs about parenting at The Hipster Monk , also plans his holiday budget in advance. Hebert is able to manage his holiday spending in part because he doesn’t do traditional gift-giving. 
“Instead of gifts, I give [my children] a set amount of cash with the caveat that they have to donate a portion of it to a good cause of their choice,” he said.
DON’T: Beat yourself up if you spend a little more than you planned
Hebert sometimes goes over his planned holiday budget when he wants to share a special holiday activity with his children. “Holiday activities that [my children] enjoy are usually inexpensive and not an economic issue," he said. "The fact that they aren't greedy in this regard makes it easy for me to go beyond the budget from time to time.”
Dr. Markham also suggests that parents relax their budget if it’s for an item a child is likely to need in the future.
“Let’s say your child has outgrown an old bike," said Markham. "If you’re going to get a new bike anyway, which probably you are, then it’s okay to go over your budget in Christmas to do it, since you might otherwise be buying it in March.”
DON’T: Let the “fear of disappointment” add stress to your season
Many parents worry that they will disappoint their children if they do not buy all of the items on the holiday wish list, or can’t afford every single trip to the ice skating rink or the Nutcracker ballet, but Noga has a different perspective.
“When you give kids everything that they want, they don’t need to manage their emotions and they don’t have to develop emotional capacity,” said Noga. 
In this case, disappointing a child isn’t a bad thing—it’s is an important part of parenting.
This fear of disappointment often leads to parents overextending themselves—in terms of both money and time—is likely to turn the holiday season from magical to miserable. 
“Somehow, staying up all around the clock decorating the house and making the cookies and spending over our budget—in the end, it’s bad for our child,” Dr. Markham said. “We get crabby, and we snap at our child, and that’s the opposite of what they need. And if we’re worried sick about money after that, it’s the opposite of what we need also.”

Five farmers took their lives in Maharashtra in the three days to Monday.
The wave of farmer suicides in the rain-shadow regions of Marathwada and Vidarbha continues unabated despite the new Bharatiya Janata Party government announcing relief measures to combat the agricultural crisis affecting more than 19,000 villages in the State.
Three consecutive years of drought and unseasonable rain have broken the spirit of farmers.
Reports say changing weather patterns, mounting indebtedness and poor crop yield are driving farmers to suicide.
Tulsidas Madalwad, a minor farmer, electrocuted himself at Kakandi village in Nanded district unable to pay off the debts accumulated over multiple bad harvests on his two-acre farm. “He returned from his field and electrocuted himself by stringing wires to his feet around 10 a.m. When his wife and little daughter came with food, they found him charred to death,” a villager said.
Madalwad was devastated by the destruction of his soya bean crop and was worried about repaying more than Rs. 1 lakh to banks and local moneylenders, the people said.
In the neighbouring Latur district, Sangram Bemde, 46, another marginal farmer, immolated himself on Monday after his cotton crop failed for the third consecutive year, traumatising his family and relatives.
Kashiram Indore, 76, built a pyre and jumped into it on Friday following the poor soya bean yield from his one-acre farm at Manarkhed in Akola. Indore was despondent as just a quintal and a half of soya bean could be harvested this year.
The Javadekar family of Javda in Buldhana is facing the grimmest winter after their only son, Shivshankar, 24, hanged himself on Saturday evening as he could not repay the Rs. 60,000 loan his family took after their two-acre farm faced consecutive years of drought.
Family members said Shivshankar was aspiring to pursue higher education. Another farmer too committed suicide in the district.

Delhi: St Sebastians Church gutted by fire  Christian community suspect foul playWritten by Sarah Hafeez | New Delhi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 9:22 pm | Updated: December 2, 2014 1:43 pm
It’s East Delhi again. There is a minority place of worship in question. And again there are allegations of mischief.
A fire broke out in a church in Northeast Delhi’s Dilshad Garden on Monday morning. Police have registered a case under IPC Section 436 (arson) following allegations by parish members that the fire was not accidental.
VIDEO: 
“A case has been registered. A forensic team went to St Sebastian Catholic Church in Dilshad Garden and collected two samples. The fire department is also preparing a report. Only after receiving these reports that we will able to ascertain the exact cause of the fire,” a police officer said.

Fire control room said they received a call around 7.26 am on Monday that a fire had broken out at the church. Four fire tenders were rushed to the spot and took around two hours to douse the flames. No casualties were reported as no one was present in the church except for the guard who spotted the fire and informed police.
Police said besides arson, they are looking at the possibility of a short circuit. The church was built in 2001.
Delhi Archbishop Anil Couto has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, calling on him to order a judicial enquiry into the fire. Couto said members of the Christian community will protest at the Delhi Police commissioner’s office on Tuesday morning to highlight “attempts to polarise the people in Delhi state” ahead of Assembly elections”.

He said the “arson” was an act of “sacrilege and hate” against the community and its faith and it was surprising that such an act could take place in Delhi, which is just recovering from a series of communal incidents”.
Father Mathew Koyickal, chancellor (Archdiocese of Delhi) alleged that “someone deliberately set fire to the church as there is a strong smell of kerosene in the air”. The first floor was gutted, and the holy books and the alter were reduced to ash.
He said residents who had gathered outside the church became restive when they saw no police officers present at the site.

Maharashtra Chief Minister delivers on drought package and transfer policiesWritten by Shubhangi Khapre | Mumbai |
Posted: December 1, 2014 10:17 pm
At the end of one month chief minister Devendra Fadnavis lead government has made its mark in two major decisions related to combating drought and reforms in transfer policies in government.
In absence of full-fledged cabinet, Fadnavis appears to be going slow in taking hard decisions which could have a long term financial implications. The stress has been to firefight the issues on daily basis rather than take a couple of hard decisions that would make a mark.
In a candid admission, Fadnavis said, “The major challenge before us is tackling the severe drought. There are 19,069 villages reeling under agriculture drought out of the total 39,134 villages across Maharashtra.” However, Fadnavis has given impetus to the reforms in
power sector which he admits would take some more time to bring results.
In less than two weeks after he took the charge the government streamlined the coal linkages that helped in additional 1700 MW power. It helped to bring down the power outage by three hours daily in rural Maharashtra.
The primary task to get the central financial assistance culminated in Rs 4,000 crore drought relief package and Rs 4,500 crore drought
mitigation package. A senior secretary in power ministry said, “Frankly, speaking you cannot expect outstanding policy decisions within a month. In power sector if we have to usher major reforms it would adversely affect 40 lakh farmers whose electricity dues we are waiving.”
The pressure to provide loan waiver also means the targeted agriculture growth of four per cent will not be met this year. The decision to rationalise power tariff to provide concessions to industries is also on hold because of drought.
However, Fadnavis appears to have focused on fixing the basic problems both inside and outside the government. He has sought the proposals from all 29 departments in Mantralaya to provide the strength and grades of officials. Thus making it clear that transfers of non-IAS category would be dealt by the concerned department head and not brought to the chief minister of concerned minister.
The process of decentralisation including in home ministry which he holds has send a positive note in administration. A former Congress minister said, “If it is enforced in letter and spirit without political interference it would indicate they are seriously tackling corruption which has become rampant in transfer of officials.”
The decentralisation of transfer policy from minister to concerned head of departments in irrigation sector and Food and Drugs Administration is perceived as a big step forward to tackle corruption. The chief minister also indicated that government would like to empower the officials to bring more efficiency and accountability in administration.
While the government promises ten per cent growth in state, it does not explain how it would achieve the target minus growth in agriculture and industry. However, two decision which could have been taken relates to bringing an alternative to local body tax and toll tax policy. Fadnavis promise on both these issues appear on paper.
Although he held discussions with various organisations and civic authorities. The government’s urgency to fast track coastal continued…

Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors November Sales Go Up; Mahindra Lags
NDTV | Updated On: December 02, 2014 15:29 (IST)
Court Refuses to Let Off Hindalco in Coal Block Case
Auto majors Maruti Suzuki India and Tata Motors posted year-on-year growth in sales for the month of November, with the country's largest carmaker reporting an over 19 per cent jump in total sales. Mahindra and Mahindra, on the other hand, posted de-growth during the period citing sluggish demand led by weak consumer sentiment and high interest rates.
Maruti Suzuki India registered a 19.5 per cent rise in total sales at 1,10,147 units. Of which, 1,00,024 units were sold domestically - a growth of 16.9 per cent against November 2013 numbers.
In the passenger vehicle segment, Maruti Suzuki reported sales of 82,306 units, indicating a 14.6 per cent increase from the 71,649 units sold in the year-ago period.
Tata Motors, which posted a marginal 2.1 per cent year-on-year growth in total sales, sold 10,286 units in the passenger vehicle segment during the period - a 30 per cent upsurge from 71,679 units sold in the same month last year.
Mahindra and Mahindra, however, registered total sales of 34,292 units during the month, as against 39,254 units in the corresponding period last year - a decline of 12.6 per cent. Domestically, the carmaker sold 32,100 units, down 11.5 per cent compared with 36,261 units last year. In the passenger vehicles segment, the auto maker reported a 17.9 fall in sales.
"The reducing international crude prices and the subsequent lowering of fuel prices should help in revival of demand in the coming months," said Pravin Shah, chief executive of the automotive division and international operations (AFS) at M&M.
Among players in the commercial vehicles segment, Hinduja Group flagship company Ashok Leyland registered a nearly 44 per cent y-o-y increase in total sales in November 2014, whereas Mahindra registered a drop of over 33 per cent in total tractor sales at 15,333 units.
Two wheelers
Royal Enfield saw a 52 per cent jump in total sales last month. In the domestic market also, the motorcycle manufacturer posted a similar 53 per cent growth in sales at 27,198 units.
TVS Motor Company said sales of its two weelers were at 2,10,979 units, up 35.6 per cent compared with 1,55,604 units in the year-ago period.
Hero MotoCorp, the country's biggest maker of two wheelers, notified a 3.2 per cent increase in total sales at 5,47,413 units.
On the other hand, Bajaj Auto reported a 6 per cent year-on-year decline in motorcycle sales at 2,61,948 units last month.

The father of DNA is selling his Nobel prize because everyone thinks hes racistBy Rachel Feltman December 1 Follow @rachelfeltman
James Watson discusses discovering DNA in an interview with Chris Johnson from, "A Better Life: 100 Atheists Speak Out on Joy & Meaning in a World Without God" in 2013. (Youtube/ Chris Johnson)
James Watson, known to many as one of the "fathers of DNA" for his scientific discoveries, is putting his Nobel prize on the auction block this Thursday with a reserve price of $2.5 million. Why part with the prestigious award now, over 50 years after winning it? After all, no living recipient of the award has ever sold it before.
In short, Watson said some racist things back in 2007, and the publication of those comments had an impact on his income. In what certainly has the appearance of the most passive aggressive gesture of all time, Watson is selling his award in the hopes it will bolster the income he receives from his academic appointments – and perhaps finance the purchase of some new artwork.
But the 86-year-old Watson, who told the Financial Times that he'd become an "unperson" after his 2007 remarks (more on those in a second), isn't getting much sympathy: Instead, the widely publicized sale is drawing attention to the very comments that got him ostracized from academia in the first place.
Watson is indeed a great scientist, and the world has much to thank him for. Along with Francis Crick, Watson revealed the structure of DNA – the double helix that forms the very nature of our being – in 1953. While the discovery would have been impossible without the work of a woman named Rosalind Franklin, who took a groundbreaking image of DNA the year before, she had died by the time the Nobel prize was awarded – leaving Watson and Crick to take majority of the credit in history's eyes. But despite the mother who's often forgotten, Watson is most certainly one of the fathers of DNA. His Nobel prize was well deserved.
This image provided by Christie's auction house shows the 1962 Nobel Prize medal James Watson won for his role in the discovery of the structure of DNA. The medal is going on the auction block Dec. 4, 2014, at Christie's. (Christie's/AP)
But great scientists are not always great people. In a 2007 interview with the Sunday Times, Watson expressed the belief that some races are inherently less intelligent than others.
He was "inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa," he said , because "all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours – whereas all the testing says not really." He added that while he hoped everyone was truly equal, "people who have to deal with black employees find this not true."
I mean, yikes.
It wasn't Watson's first tango with controversy: In 2000, he reportedly made a link between skin color and sex drive during a lecture. "That's why you have Latin lovers," the AP reports Watson is said to have told the lecture hall. "You've never heard of an English lover. Only an English patient."
Double yikes.
So Watson must be apologetic about the flagrant racism of his remarks, right? Yes? We hope?
Nah. Watson is proving himself to be king of the non-apology .
“I apologise . . . [the journalist] somehow wrote that I worried about the people in Africa because of their low IQ – and you’re not supposed to say that," he told the Financial Times . 
Watson's auction will probably buy him the David Hockney painting he reportedly has his eye on – the awards are always interesting to collectors, and this one is for the discovery of the double-helix. But for those of us without $2.5 million to throw in Watson's pocket, the incident is a poignant reminder that scientists need not be held up on pedestals: They are human. Sometimes they can be really cool, but sometimes they can do not-cool things – and they should be held accountable.
Nature editor Adam Rutherford makes this case in a column for the Guardian :
“No one really wants to admit I exist” says Watson. That’s not it. It’s more that no one is interested in his racist, sexist views. Watson, alongside Crick, will always be the discoverer of the double helix, to my mind the scientific breakthrough of the 20th century. Here’s our challenge: celebrate science when it is great, and scientists when they deserve it. And when they turn out to be awful bigots, let’s be honest about that too. It turns out that just like DNA, people are messy, complex and sometimes full of hideous errors.
This is far from an isolated problem. Just weeks ago, a European Space Agency scientist received online criticism for wearing a shirt covered in scantily-clad women on an international livestream. While Matt Taylor apologized, those who'd called him out were then subject to a loud – and sometimes ugly – backlash from supporters of the scientist, many of whom cited his great accomplishments as being reason enough not to comment on any contribution he may have made to the science community's issues with sexism.
And Richard Dawkins, whose 1976 book "The Selfish Gene" helped to bring the theory of evolution into public awareness, has been known to go on occasional Twitter rants that leave his followers wondering if he's become a rape apologist, or if his anti-religion sentiments have crept into the territory of racism and islamophobia .
But despite Watson's views, his award will probably fetch a pretty penny when it goes up for auction at Christie's New York on Dec. 4: Last year , a letter written from Crick to his son outlining his recent discovery of the double helix sold for more than  $6 million dollars – and that's without being made of 18-carat gold.

CM Devendra Fadnavis declares state honours to Dr B R AmbedkarBy: Express News Service | Mumbai |
Posted: December 1, 2014 10:28 pm | Updated: December 1, 2014 10:29 pm
Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Monday announced the government would accord state honours to Dr B R Ambedkar on December 6, which marks his death anniversary. This is the first time the state government has taken the decision in the last six decades.
The decision comes at a time when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government is facing flak over its failure to arrest those responsible for last month’s brutal killing of three members from a Dalit family in Javakheda, Ahmednagar district.
Lakhs of Ambedkar followers congregate at Dadar’s Chaityabhoomi every year on December 6, which is observed as Mahaparinirvan Din. To manage the rush, the government has decided to run eight special trains- six along Central Railway and two along Konkan Railway.
Fadnavis, who presided over a meeting to review preparations for the day, also announced that as a mark of respect to Dr Ambedkar, his government will shower flowers on Chaityabhoomi from a helicopter. On the day, the government will also bring out advertisements recounting Dr Ambedkar’s contribution in leading newspapers, the CM said.
While Dalit activists, who remained present at the meeting, had also demanded that December 6 be declared as a government holiday, the CM argued that the government has been declaring holidays on birth anniversaries of inspirational leaders. He argued that declaring a holiday on Dr Ambedkar’s death anniversary would set a precedent.
The activists further sought Fadnavis to declare it a “dry day” on December 6. Fadnavis asked his officials to examine its feasibility.
Last week, several Dalit activists and supporters had taken to streets in Mumbai, participating in two separate morchas-one staged by RPI leader Ramdas Athavale and another by Ambedkar’s grandson Prakash, protesting against rise in Dalit atrocities.

FC Goa go second after handing NorthEast United 3-0 drubbingBy: Press Trust of India | Margao |
Posted: December 1, 2014 10:12 pm
FC Goa registered their third win on the trot at home as they drubbed NorthEast United FC 3-0 to jump to second place in the Hero Indian Super League at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium here today.
FC Goa, who led 2-0 at half time, scored through Romeo Fernandes (33rd minute), Miroslav Slepicka (45+1) and Andre Santos (74th).
The Zico-coached side ended their home campaign with their third straight win and moved to second spot with 18
points from 12 matches to brighten their chances of making it to the semifinals.
NorthEast United FC remained on sixth place at the league standings with 13 points from 12 matches.
FC Goa went offensive from the start and created couple of scoring chances early in the match but Amiri and Andre
Santos failed to find the target.
Romeo Fernandes infused spark in the match by breaking the deadlock in the 33th minute. Debrata Roy, who initiated the move on the right flank, relayed the ball to Romeo Fernandes who, in turn, laid a pass to Andre Santos inside the box.
Santos quickly gave a forward pass back to Romeo who after getting the better of defender Miguel Garcia essayed a
left footer that hit the post and went in.
The visitors made a substitution bringing in James Keene in place of Kondwani Mtonga and the striker did pose problems to the home team defenders as he came close to scoring twice.
Striker Miroslav Slepicka increased the lead in the first minute of the first half injury time when he shot home with a
stiff grounder, beating the rival keeper T Rehenseh to have the home team leading 2-0 at half time.
After the change of ends, the visitors made double changes bringing in Tomas Josi and Alen Deory in place of
Isaac Chansa and Zodingliana and made some concerted moves with Koke nearly finding the mark.
Jan Seda, who looked confident under the bar, made a rare blemish when he failed to collect a chip from the left, but luckily the ball was cleared by a home team defender for safety.
With the visitors doing most of the probing, FC Goa came with a counter move and scored their third goal to settle the issue.

CAG will continue to be stringent  objective: Vinod RaiBy: Express News Service | Mumbai |
Posted: December 1, 2014 10:06 pm
Responding to criticism that reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) are disruptive to the economy, former CAG Vinod Rai said that those who make such statements are simply seeking alibis to non-performance.
Speaking at a BG Deshmukh memorial lecture organized by the Public Concern for Governance Trust, about the need for good governance, Rai said that the CAG reports will continue to be as stringent and objective as before.
“I don’t see any threat at all to CAG’s work. In terms of independence, there is no threat. You only need to empower institutions,” Rai said at the lecture held at Indian Merchants Chamber, Churchgate.
However, he said that government institutions such as the Central Vigilance Commission or CAG are not being allowed to function.
“Today, it is the institutions such as the that are not being allowed to function. Attempts are made to ensure that they don’t bring out things in the public domain. Whenever we bring out anything that is uncomfortable, the attempt is to shoot the messenger than address the malaise,” Rai said.
He added that after the 2009 election, CAG had attempted to look into the meteoric rise in the assets of contesting candidates as declared to the Election Commission.
“I spoke to Chief Election Commissioner Dr. SY Quraishi to get declaration of assets of some candidates in 2004 and the same candidates in 2009. The different was 300 times more, not 300 percent, but 300 times,” Rai said.
However, he said he was told that scrutinizing the massive rise in the assets of candidates does not fall under CAG’s ambit.
“We could do nothing about it, but why can’t the income tax authorities question them?” Rai said.
He added that it is time for the educated urban middle class to step in and to ensure that institutions are allowed to function.

Samsung might launch Tizen-based smartphone in India next weekSamsung might launch a Tizen smartphone on December 10 under Rs Rs 10,000.
Posted: December 1, 2014 9:56 pm | Updated: December 1, 2014 10:27 pm
South Korean electronic giant Samsung is expected to launch a smartphone, based on its new Tizen operating system, in India later this month.
According to sources, the smartphone major is expected to launch the device on December 10 in the affordable category (sub-Rs 10,000).
The company was not available for comments. Currently, only a few devices, including Samsung’s smartwatch products run on the Tizen platform.
A majority of Samsung’s mobile phones are currently powered by the Android platform, which is also the dominant OS on most smartphones across the globe.
Launched as a competitor to Android and iOS OS’, Tizen aims to address the needs of stakeholders of mobile and connected device ecosystem, including device manufacturers, mobile operators, application developers and independent software vendors (ISVs).
In June, Samsung had showcased ‘Samsung Z’, which came with a 4.8 inch HD display and 2.3 GHz Quad-core processor.
Showcased at the Tizen Developer Conference, San Francisco, the handset featured 8MP rear camera, 2.1MP front camera, 2GB RAM, 16 GB internal memory (expandable up to 64GB) and a 2,600 mAh battery.
The company had planned to make the handset available in Russia in third quarter in Russia, but the plan was scrapped.
Previously, Samsung ran ‘Bada’ OS, which did not see much success. It has since been working on merging the platform with Tizen, which is backed by chipmaker Intel Corp.
The other popular operating systems include Apple iOS, Microsoft’s Windows Phone OS and BlackBerry’s proprietary platform.

National Investigation Agency takes arrested terrorists of Burdwan blast to their operation siteBy: Press Trust of India | Kolkata |
Posted: December 1, 2014 9:54 pm
The NIA on Monday took the two terrorists arrested in connection with the Burdwan blast to Beldanga area of Murshidabad district to identify the places from where they used to operate.
“Today we took Sajid and Hakim to Beldanaga area in Murshidabad district to identify the site of their operation and the kind of activities they used to do,” said a National Investigation Agency official on condition of anonymity.
The team also went to Lalgola area near the Indo-Bangladesh border and inspected some spots, a top district police officer said. Shakil Ahmed, one of the JMB terrorists who died in the Burdwan blast on October 2, had spent several months in Beldanga and ran a shop there.
A large number of IEDs were recovered from the house in Burdwan’s Khagragarh where the blast had occurred. Two persons were killed in the incident.
An international terror network having interests in Bangladesh is suspected to have a hand in it and of the eight arrested so far in connection with the blast, most are nationals of that country.
The Bangladeshi team had already interacted with the four NIA officials, who visited Dhaka recently and handed over documents to them regarding presence of JMB in several districts of West Bengal.
NIA’s information had helped the Dhaka sleuths to nab four JMB suspects, including JMB women wing chief Fatema Begum, who is also the wife of Burdwan blast prime accused Sajid.

Republicans are about to take the reins in Congress. Half the public thinks thats a bad thing.By Sean Sullivan December 1 Follow @WaPoSean
He's about to take the helm in the Senate. Not everyone is thrilled. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)
As Republicans count down the days until they take complete control of Congress, the public is split over their new power on Capitol Hill, with half the country saying the new GOP control over both chambers of Congress isn't a great development for the country.
Fifty percent of Americans say Republican control of both the Senate and the House will be a bad thing, according to a new CNN/ORC poll released Monday, while 44 percent say it will be a good thing.
Republicans swept into power in the Senate in last month's midterm election. In the House, they padded their existing majority.
A majority of Americans -- 52 percent -- say the new power structure will result in more gridlock between the White House and Congress. Thirty-seven percent say it will make no difference. Just 9 percent predict there will be less gridlock.
The CNN poll was conducted from Nov. 21-23, about two and a half weeks after the Nov. 4 midterms.
A clear majority of Americans, 74 percent, say they saw the election results as a repudiation of Democratic policies, as opposed to a GOP mandate. Just 16 percent say they saw it as a Republican mandate.
Sean Sullivan has covered national politics for The Washington Post since 2012.

Can Hillary Clinton win white working class voters Its not likely.By Philip Bump December 1 Follow @pbump
The white working class's movement away from the Democratic party isn't a function of Barack Obama's presidency. Recently we looked at exit polling gauging support for each party's House candidate every two years since 1980. Since the value of incomes fluctuates over time ($30,000 now isn't what it was in 1980), it uses responses from non-college graduates and college graduates as a way of approximating class membership. Consistently since 2004, non-college graduate whites have preferred Republicans by a wider margin than have college-educated whites.
The National Journal wonders whether  Hillary Clinton might reclaim support from that group when she runs in 2016 (which she is going to do). It's a headline-as-question that readers love so much (see above), but the article leaves it unanswered. Or, rather, it makes clear that one is intended to apply Betteridge's Law of Headlines : That a headline ending in a question mark should be answered, "no."
It's worth exploring the question a little more. First, it seems pretty likely that Clinton will do better with working-class whites than Obama did. In July, CNN ran a poll that pit both Clinton and Obama against Mitt Romney -- allowing us to pretty directly compare the two candidates. The graph below shows how each demographic group did versus the overall split in the poll. So, Obama lost to Romney in CNN's match-up by nine points, but we're comparing how badly Obama lost among whites (by 29 points) to that -9 margin -- meaning he did 20 points worse with whites than the overall margin.
You can see that Clinton does slightly less badly among whites, and substantially better among those making under $50,000 or who have no college degree. (But a bit worse among those making over $50,000.)
But the question isn't "will Hillary do better" -- it's "can she win working-class whites?"
To better answer that, we can look at data from a September McClatchy/Marist poll . The graph below pits Clinton against three possible Republicans: Gov. Chris Christie (N.J.), Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.) and former Gov. Jeb Bush (Fla.). Clinton beats them all -- but loses among whites in each case.
Note, though, that Clinton wins among those earning under $50,000 a year -- as she does among every other group. What's missing in this data is a split by race and income.
Happily, the good people at Quinnipiac University shared detailed breakdowns of their November polling with The Post, including how Clinton did in head-to-head contests against their battery of Republican contenders. The margins of error are fairly high here, since we're talking about smaller and smaller slices of respondents. (In each subset, the MOE is over 5 percent.) But it's the best data we have. (Note that Quinnipiac's overall splits showed closer races between Clinton and the Republicans; it had her losing to Romney, for example.)
Here's the split by white voter economic group -- and then how each economic group compares to the split among all white voters.
Clinton is leading in Quinnipiac's polling among white voters who earn under $30,000 a year only when she's running against Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) -- and then only barely. (She also leads among the wealthiest white voters when running against Cruz.) In general, though, she tends to fare better among lower-income whites compared to white voters overall.
As with all 2016 polling, this is all very, very early and almost certainly not closely reflective of what will happen two Novembers from now. As the National Journal points out, Clinton doesn't need to actually win among working-class whites (or whites in general) to win the presidency -- Obama didn't. But the answer to the question "can Clinton win that population" seems pretty clearly to be "not at this rate." Betteridge's law holds true once again.

What social media did for FergusonBy Caitlin Dewey November 25 Follow @caitlindewey
When a grand jury decided on Monday not to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson for shooting an unarmed teenager, Twitter predictably lit up in protest — a sudden, sweeping surge of 3.5 million tweets that spiked just before 9:30 p.m. Eastern and simmered for hours.
#Ferguson was active in the U.S., of course. But a visualization of tweets on the hashtag, published by Twitter this morning, show tens of thousands of tweets outside the U.S., as well: Messages from Germany, Spain and Britain. Tweets from Chile and Brazil. South Africa. South Korea. Indonesia. Mongolia. Saudi Arabia, even.
The death of a teenage boy in a small town outside St. Louis had somehow come to mean something to people all over the world, for a variety of reasons: the racial inequities that many thought it exposed; the escalation of violence on the ground; the stubborn impression that, even in the world’s most powerful democracy, justice simply wasn’t being done. Each of those tensions and impressions and escalations also had a megaphone it wouldn’t have had 10 years ago. They became the purview of the many, not the few.
Not every blip of information in the social media stream had merit. But as my colleague Nancy Scola wrote this morning , users were able to turn social media to incredible social good: documenting conditions on the ground, organizing protesters, building awareness and literacy. Amplifying the cries for justice in Ferguson — not only across the country, but around the world.
It’s odd, given those facts, that St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch reserved so much of his ire for Twitter and its ilk in his announcement of the grand jury’s decision last night. Social media fueled rumors and speculation, he claimed. Behind the “24-hour news cycle,” it was “the most significant challenge” of his investigation, fueling a constant demand for answers, and the invention of answers when none actually came.
McCulloch has a point, of course — it’s not like Twitter is some hallowed, perfect tool. Misinformation spreads; discussions devolve into flame wars; rumors spiral way out of control.
But it’s important to remember that social media is only a tool: Its purpose is to amplify and magnify and accelerate information, but it has no agenda or will of its own. In Ferguson, social media amplified widespread suspicions and angers and anxieties. In other words, social media didn’t create the problems McCulloch speaks of — it just put those things on a platform where everyone could see them. In Ferguson. In Sweden. In everywhere in between.
Watching Twitter’s visualization of the Ferguson tweets today, it’s difficult to see how that could be a bad thing.

Life After Retirement: A Financial ChecklistYour ATM Usage Pattern Need Not Hurt Your Pocket
Retirement is a time to relax and a time to relish a life well lived. Financial travails should not come in the way of experiencing this important stage in life. The monetary state of affairs will undoubtedly undergo a change overnight due to the loss of full-time job. Retirement budget planning is therefore very important as this is a period where you face maximum expenses, minimum income and weakening health.
1. Budget Planning
There is no right and wrong time for budget planning. The earlier the better, as then one can adequately plan for the changes in financial affairs post-retirement. A proper budget plan would help in knowing the quantum of money that is required to live a decent life and making the necessary investment choices in light of the ground realities.
A budget plan would consist of the following:
Daily expenses: Some percentage of the savings should be kept aside for everyday expenses like grocery items and utility bills. Interest earning from FDs, earnings form pension plans etc. can be utilized for this. Parking some money in liquid assets like gold is also a good idea.
Bracing for emergencies: You might come across a lot of unexpected expenses in retirement period. It is important to set aside a sum equivalent to at least six months of expenses to take care of medical emergencies and other unforeseen happenings.
Watch Spending: An awareness of the spending behavior and patterns is probably the wisest option to save for a rainy day, as any follies in this regard would necessarily have to be followed with remedial action.
2. Income post retirement:
Working post retirement: Nothing prevents a pensioner from taking up a job, or part-time assignment if you are healthy and fit. While re-joining the workforce may appear contrary to the goal of a relaxed retired life, it is not only among the most effective income-boosters, but can also lead to an active retired life.
Income plans: Opt out for all possible income generation- be it the interest from your FDs, pension plans, renting out a portion of your house or second home, accommodating students as paying guests if you are alone, or any other, because it is always advisable not to let your savings be eaten way and to stay equipped for any unforeseen situations.
3. Taking care of investments
Smart investments are a much-needed route to security in old age to turn your retired life into a smooth affair.
Keep a watch on the following:
Protect Capital: It is of utmost importance for senior citizens to preserve their life-long savings. Safe and fixed return investment is the way to go, and avoid aggressive investment investments such as equities.
Ensure Liquidity: Senior citizens have to rely on their accumulated savings post-retirement, in the absence of a monthly salary. To cater to unforeseen emergencies, they should opt for investment products that are easily convertible into cash.
Below are some senior friendly investment options available:
Senior Citizens Savings Scheme (SCSS): SCSS is offered by many as well as the postal department. It is open for seniors aged 60 and above. The scheme has a stipulated period of 5 years and carries an interest rate of around 9 per cent.
Fixed Deposits (FD) for senior citizens: Fixed deposit schemes specifically for senior citizens are offered by banks such as Punjab National Bank, Yes Bank and KarurVysya Bank, as also companies such as HDFC Ltd, LIC Housing Finance and Mahindra Finance. If you are opting for company deposits, make it with AAA rated ones, which are the safest.
Monthly Income Plans (MIP): These market-linked MIPs are offered by mutual fund houses such as Birla Sunlife, HDFC and Franklin Templeton. These schemes provide higher rate of returns compared to pure debt instruments such as FDs and post office schemes as they invest 15-20 per cent of their assets in equities.
Post Office Monthly Income Schemes: The post office's POMIS scheme assures a monthly income, with interest earnings of 8 per cent and a bonus of 10 per cent at the end of 6-year tenure.
Post Office Time Deposit (POTD): POTDs are deposit schemes offered by post offices and are similar to bank fixed deposits, except for the lower interest rates. The maturity period ranges from 1 year to 5 years and the interest ratesvary from 6.25 to 7 per cent, compounded on a quarterly basis.
4. Insurance
Health insurance is a necessity for our times, given the increase in life expectancy and the consequent rise in medical expenses. Many insurance schemes are tailor-made for senior citizens, such as the following:
VarishtaBima from National Insurance: This plan has a maximum entry age of 70 and an uppermost limit of Rs.1 lakh towards hospitalization cover. It covers existing ailments such as diabetes and high blood pressure at an additional cost of 10 per cent each.
Heart Beat from Max Bupa: This plan is open for people aged 70. Among the positives, this plan does not impose sub-limits on ICU expenses and there is no waiting period for an accident cover.
Red Carpet from Star Health: The plan has a maximum entry age of 74 and there are no tortuous medical tests unlike the other plans.
5. Met with emergencies? The property pays for the owner!
A reverse mortgage loan would provide the much-needed money to expenses like home renovation, medical expenses, travelling abroad, children's marriage etc.
Reverse mortgages are being offered by most banks in India. A senior citizen who owns a property, but lacks a regular source of income, can mortgage the property (self-owned) with a bank and get regular payment and more importantly reside in the same place throughout his life. On the death of the borrowers, the legal heirs can repay the dues to the lender and regain ownership of the property, or the lender can sell it and pay the difference to the heirs.
Detailed planning and a proper road-map can turn retirement years into a golden period of one's lives.

Land swap to ensure Assam security: Modiinternational relations
Land swap pact with Dhaka will be the solution, says the Prime Minister
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday announced that his government would utilise the land transfer agreement with Bangladesh in a manner that might seem to be an immediate loss to Assam but serve the security interests of the State in the long term.
Addressing Bharatiya Janata Party workers at the Sarusajai Stadium here, Mr. Modi said his government would utilise the agreement to seal all routes across the international border through which “illegal” Bangladeshi immigrants had been entering Assam and creating havoc in the State.
“There will be no compromise on security,” he said. “I know the sentiments of the people. We will always protect the interests of Assam and the country.”
CM stand
Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi has been critical of both the BJP and the Asom Gana Parishad for opposing the land swap deal signed by the previous United Progressive Alliance government with Bangladesh.
He has maintained that Assam will not lose land as projected by the two parties.
Mr. Modi, in his speech, warned the forces trying to harm the interests of Assam and the northeast. “Such forces should know that the government has changed in Delhi and the law will not spare them now,” he said. “The development of the entire northeast region, including Assam, is a priority for his government.”
The BJP, he said, had compelled all political parties to make development the prime issue instead of issues of caste and region. “We have turned the issue of development into an agenda of the country.”
Jan Dhan Yojana
Mr. Modi said his government had directed banks to serve the interests of the poor people under the Jan Dhan Yojana.
Over the past six decades, only one crore bank accounts were opened each year. Now, under the new scheme, one crore bank accounts were being opened every week.

Doesn t Cortana Know That Disparaging Siri Reflects Negatively on Her ParentsThe next big thing is already here.
What were the results of these campaigns?
Since it is using these tactics, one might presume that Microsoft has data that indicates they work. In fact, the opposite is true. They have not been effective , but they have done wonders for Apple.
Apple's record of success
Since these campaigns have been implemented, just about every successive introduction of the iPhone sets a new sales record . And what about Apple stock? Over the past year, it split 7 for 1, and Apple's market capitalization recently moved north of $700 billion. While it is far from perfect, Apple seems to be firing on all cylinders. Even though Apple produces only high-end smartphones, it is gaining an increasing share of the smartphone market. More importantly, it now commands a whopping 86 percent of smartphone profits. And, Apple is not standing still. It has the culture, momentum, manufacturing and design systems in place to continue succeeding. As of today, Apple reigns as the world's most valuable brand .
Microsoft is looking foolish
Good marketers know that when a company "badmouths" a competitor, it is (more often than not) a big mistake -- especially when the company being disparaged has Apple's track record of success. What's more, at last count, the Windows Phone share of the smartphone market is a disappointing 2.5 percent .
Why is it a big mistake?
There are so many reasons why "knocking" the competition is ineffective. Here are just a few.
Free advertising. When companies disparage leaders by name, it just confirms that they are the ones to buy. It also makes "free" positive brand impressions for them in the minds of prospective buyers.
No reasons to buy your product. Disparaging the competition does nothing to give buyers reasons to buy yours. In fact, many presume you are knocking successful competitors because you want to ride on their coattails.
Makes you look bad. When you disparage competitors, many in the target audience think negatively about you.
When you badmouth popular products, you are putting down the people that like them. Those you insult will not be inclined to buy your products, and they will spread the negative word about you to their friends -- resulting in a negative word-of-mouth pyramid that makes unflattering statements about your company and products.
Makes you look arrogant and insecure at the same time. Consumers learn at an early age that good companies don't "bad-mouth" competitors. Leading companies know their products are good and have no reason to talk negatively about competitors.
Puts a target on your back. When you tell the marketplace that your products are better than popular competitors, you are putting a target on your own back. Many will go out of their way to find defects and prove you wrong.
What should Microsoft and other companies do?
When faced with formidable competitors such as Apple, what should companies do if they really believe their products are better? They should focus on the benefits and advantages of their own products. A successful approach is to use the "elephant's trunk" strategy. It goes something like this, "We give you what the other popular smartphones give you (this neutralizes the competition) plus we give you "this" (you would replace the word "this" with the unique advantages of your product)." Whatever you do, do not mention competitors by name, and do not disparage them. This only backfires as we have seen with RIM (now Blackberry), Hewlett-Packard, Nokia (its handset business is now owned by Microsoft), and others. Apple should send a thank-you note to them for running, and paying for, ads that continue to help Apple's sales and profits grow.

Time-Compressed Nonprofit Directors - Recruit and Retain Them!reddit
Every nonprofit board has had the experience of having board positions open and being unable to fill them with highly qualified people. The usual response from qualified candidates is that they are too busy to be accept a board position. However, the real reasons, never voiced if speaking privately, are that they perceive the nonprofit decision process to be too slow, board agendas loaded with minutiae, presentations that take up more time than they should, unfocused discussion, etc.
Following is a list of selling points to potential board candidates, providing a board can deliver on them!
• We are careful to make wise use of your valuable time.
• Board meetings will begin and end of time, a quorum will be present at the beginning of the meeting.
• Board meeting binders will be sent a week ahead of time.
• The agenda also will be sent out a week ahead of time.
• If one misses a meeting, the minutes will be available within a week afterwards.
• If one is going to be traveling, we have the facility for directors to attend by conference call.
• Divisional staff reports will each have a time limit and be well prepared in advance, so the agenda can be completed as scheduled. The CEO works with each presenter ahead of time.
• The board chair has the responsibility to quickly refocus discussions if they get off track.

The Power of Transparency and Transformation: BSR Has it Rightreddit
"How do we know which companies are serious about sustainability, and not simply paying lip service?" This is the question I'm asked by graduate business and law students, employees at multinational corporations, and audiences of business and NGO leaders. The research for my book showed that companies that find solutions to global problems -- in order to profit while building a better world -- do three things well: effective board governance, NGO/nonprofit partnerships, and stakeholder engagement. They also make information readily available about all three, so these companies are also good at disclosure.
Yet, one might still look at a list of companies that rate rather well in all four areas and still have concerns about their social impacts.
Aron Cramer, President & CEO for BSR, went to the heart of the matter in addressing BSR's annual conference earlier this month. The greatest challenge is the context in which companies operate. "Without changed market rules, it's very hard for long-term thinking to get embedded in what companies do."
A vital force that will drive long-term thinking is integrated reporting. Three organizations -- the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Integrated International Reporting Council (IIRC), and the Sustainable Accounting Standards Board (SASB) -- joined  together with business leaders at BSR's conference to discuss integrated business reports that address non-financial risks and opportunities (sustainability issues) that affect corporations' ability to create long term value.
BSR plays a vital role in convening 275 member companies and establishing a multitude of business collaborations and multistakeholder initiatives to help advance new business models and transform markets. Read more here about BSR's work and how your company can become involved.

economy, business and finance
Capital markets regulator SEBI has imposed Rs. 9 lakh fine on brokerage Moneybee Securities and two of its clients for fraudulent trading in shares of New Horizon Leasing and Finance.
Securities and Exchange Board of India has found that Moneybee Securities and its clients -- Dhiren Shah (HUF) and Yogesh Laxman Rege -- had indulged in synchronised trades in the shares of New Horizon.
Finding them in violation of ‘Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Regulations’, the regulator through a recent order has imposed a penalty of Rs. 3 lakh on each one of them.
As per the order, Dhiren Shah is ‘karta’ of Dhiren HUF and is also director of Moneybee, while Rege is having trading as well as Portfolio Management Services account with the brokerage firm.
SEBI observed that Moneybee and Yogesh had contributed to price rise and positive LTP through synchronised trades.
Yogesh had also contributed in establishing positive LTP (Last Trading Price) and NHP (New High Price) through various trades in the scrip of New Horizon.
In these trades Dhiren HUF was the counterparty and all the three “had acted in fraudulent manner and in connivance with each other”.
The case relates to SEBI probe into the trading in New Horizon shares from October 6, 2010 to February 4, 2011.
Probe found that there was no trading in the scrip of the New Horizon prior to investigation period as trading in equity shares of the company was suspended and the suspension was revoked on October 6, 2010.
During the entire investigation period, the scrip was traded in the price range of Rs. 50 to Rs. 119.7 with an average volume of 2,529 shares on BSE.
Post investigation period, the scrip was traded in the price range of Rs. 95.75 to Rs. 105.05 with an average volume of 1,922 shares on BSE.
SEBI observed that during the investigation period, trading in New Horizon’s shares took place on 34 days out of total 85 days. Further, out of 34 trading days, on 23 trading days, the scrip opened at a price higher than its previous closing price.

parliament
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Monday expressed hope that the much-awaited GST Bill, which provides for a uniform indirect tax structure, would be introduced in the current winter session of Parliament.
“We will try and introduce GST (Goods and Services Tax) Bill in this session...GST Bill would be taken up by the Cabinet after Empowered Committee (of state finance Minister) meeting on December 12,” he said here.
The government has proposed to implement GST from April 1, 2016, and the new Finance Commission may be set up ahead of its schedule to look into the issues related to the new indirect tax regime.
The GST will subsume indirect taxes like excise duty and service tax at the central level and VAT on the states front, besides local levies.
There are differences between the Centre and states on some issues with regard to the implementation of GST that includes the revenue neutral rate and keeping petroleum, liquor out of the ambit.
While a sub-committee on GST has suggested that the revenue neutral rate of GST be pegged at about 27 per cent, the states are yet to decide on it.
It had suggested states GST at 13.91 per cent and Central GST at 12.77 per cent.
Besides, states have been demanding that petroleum, alcohol and tobacco should be kept out of the purview of GST.
The GST Constitutional Amendment Bill, which was introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2011, had lapsed and the NDA government will be required to come up with a fresh bill.
The GST rollout has missed several deadlines because of lack of consensus among states over certain crucial issues on the new tax regime.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavison Monday said the BJP-Shiv Sena were “positive” and that they were on the verge of formalising ties. In this file photo, he is seen with Sena president Uddhav Thackeray. Photo: Special arrangement
However, he urged leaders of both sides to refrain from making out of turn statements that could impact the talks on Sena's particiaption in his government.
With the Winter Session of the Maharashtra Assembly scheduled to commence on December 8, the sense of unease between the BJP and its estranged ally, the Shiv Sena, is apparent as both sides labour over participation of the latter in the Devendra Fadvanis Government.
Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Monday reiterated that the talks between the two saffron parties were going on at a “positive” note and they were on the verge of formalising ties. In the same breathe, he urged leaders of both sides to refrain from making out of turn statements that could impact the talks.
Veiled attack
Mr. Fadnavis did not name anybody but his comments might have been a veiled attack on senior Sena leader Ramdas Kadam, who had on Sunday accused the BJP of “fooling” his party and termed the ongoing negotiations a “sham.”
“My appeal is that only official interlocutors talk to the media. Only those leaders involved in the talks, will get you the right information,” Mr. Fadnavis told reporters on the sidelines of a function.
“Talks with the Sena are progressing on a positive note. The parties have agreed upon 70-80 per cent of things. A few differences remain to be discussed and I am confident that they will be sorted out soon,” the CM said.
The two parties on Friday formally started their talks on the Sena’s induction and the BJP had sent two senior leaders -- Dharmendra Pradhan and Chandrakant Patil -- to hold parleys with Uddhav Thackeray. The Sena’s demand is for a “respectable share” of portfolios and it is said to be pushing for eight Cabinet berths.
Multiple charges
Late on Sunday night, Sena leaders met Mr. Fadnavis at his official bungalow and expressed their desire to be a part of the government. Mr. Fadnavis’ Cabinet has only 10 Ministers, with many holding multiple charges and he has indicated that he wants to expand the Ministry before the winter session.
The BJP looks unlikely to give in to the Sena’s demand for the post of Deputy CM and the Home portfolio. The future of the talks will depend on whether the BJP comes up with alternate Ministries acceptable to the Sena.
The two parties are scheduled to meet tonight at 9.30 p.m.
Stability of government
The BJP, which has 122 seats -- 23 short of a majority —is looking for a stable government. It currently depends on the outside support of the NCP, which has 41 MLAs, but their liaison comes with a moral dilemma for the BJP as it had run an aggressive campaign against the NCP on corruption.
NCP chief Sharad Pawar’s comments, later contradicted, that the stability of the government did not depend on his party has put the BJP under pressure to try and wriggle out of the sticky situation.

Personal staff of Congress-NCP ministers cannot work for new ministers: Maharashtra government6
0
Mumbai: Maharashtra government on Monday issued a directive prohibiting government employees who had worked with ministers in the Congress-NCP government as personal assistants or on some other posts from working with the current ministers.
The Narendra Modi government at the Centre had issued a similar directive after NDA came to power.
A government resolution (GR) issued by the General Administration Department of the state said, "Those who have worked as private secretary, officer on special duty or personal assistant with Chief Minister/Deputy Chief Minister/Ministers... in the last 10 years cannot work in the ministerial establishment for the next five years.
The Narendra Modi government at the Centre had issued a similar directive after NDA came to power.
#congress #ncp #maharashtra #maharashtra government
"Those who have been so appointed (after the Devendra Fadnavis government took the charge on October 31), should be repatriated to their original departments."
After the change of regime, several personal secretaries and others who had worked for Congress-NCP ministers were reportedly lobbying for similar postings in BJP government.
Appointment of these staff members is the prerogative of the respective ministers. A minister can choose any class-I officer as his or her personal secretary.

Taliban release new  weird video after latest attack on Camp BastionBy Dan Lamothe December 1 Follow @danlamothe
Insurgents launched a fierce attack on a major military base in southern Afghanistan on Thursday, one month after U.S. and coalition troops turned it over to the Afghan military. It follows a script similar to another deadly attack on the same base, Camp Bastion, in 2012: The fighters planned for it, trained for it and then released video highlighting it afterward.
The video was posted to YouTube on Saturday and publicized by the Long War Journal while the attack was still ongoing. A few dozen Taliban fighters launched it with automatic weapons and suicide vests, Reuters reported . At least five Afghan troops were killed on Friday in the fight, which continued this weekend, several media reports said. Those same reports varied on how many insurgents were killed, putting the number at between nine and 26.
The new video includes images of 10 fighters in training. They wear camouflage military uniforms, long beards and white head coverings, moving together in formation and running laps inside a dusty compound while carrying assault weapons. Music plays in the background, and a collection of photographs of the insurgents involved is shown.
Taliban fighters prepare for a November 2014 attack on Camp Bastion, Afghanistan, in a new video released by the group on Saturday. (YouTube screen grab)
The video also shows another method the Taliban used to prepare for the attack: creating a model of the base with model aircraft, hangars and vehicles. Doing so raises questions about how much inside knowledge about the base’s layout they had.
This image taken from a Taliban propaganda video shows a model they created of Camp Bastion, Afghanistan, which they attacked on Thursday night. (YouTube screen grab)
Long War Journal reports that the video was uploaded by a group calling itself “Mehsud Media,” implying it may be aligned with the Mehsud branch of the Pakistani Taliban. Leaders of that group have in recent days pledged allegiance to both Mullah Mohammed Omar, the leader of the Taliban, and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State militant group, raising questions whether there might be a rift in the Mehsud group’s leadership.
Fifteen insurgents trained in Pakistan launched a similar attack on Camp Bastion in September 2012 that killed two U.S. Marines, wounded 17 other coalition members and destroyed or severely damaged nine aircraft. The lone surviving insurgent in that attack , Mohammed Nazeer, later told investigators that the insurgents worked from information provided by someone with access to the base. He has been sentenced to death by an Afghan court, but it isn’t clear when or if the execution will be carried out.
The Taliban released a video following the 2012 attack that showed how they breached the base’s external perimeter with basic fence cutters and knew where the aircraft they destroyed were kept.

The surprisingly political origins of Cyber MondayBy Justin Moyer December 1 Follow @justinwmmoyer
Cyber Monday was invented by a conservative lobbying group. (REUTERS/Kacper Pempel)
Those allergic to Black Friday crowds — or who wait to stay from the Ferguson protesters shutting down shopping malls in an attempt to " #BoycottBlackFriday " — can take refuge in Cyber Monday. If one's employer offers Web access, an entire Internet's worth of sales awaits.
But regardless of their motivation, those who seek one deals on Samsung 55-inch Ultra HD TVs or Nest Thermostats should know: Unlike the century-long evolution of Black Friday , Cyber Monday is not the organic development of retailers who realized there was money to be made online on the Monday after Thanksgiving.
Rather, it is the nine-year-old brainchild of the National Retail Federation (NRF) — a powerful lobbying group that often supports right-leaning causes such as the repeal of the Affordable Health Care Act and anti-union attempts to limit the power of the National Labor Relations Board.
It all started in 2005 — with a press release .
"While traditional retailers will be monitoring store traffic and sales on Black Friday (the day after Thanksgiving), online retailers have set their sights on something different: Cyber Monday, the Monday after Thanksgiving, which is quickly becoming one of the biggest online shopping days of the year," announced Shop.org , a branch of the NRF that serves online retailers . "For the past few years, online retailers have found that sales on the Monday after Thanksgiving have been creeping higher, giving retailers an additional reason to be jolly during the ceremonial kickoff to the holiday season."
The New York Times, though calling Cyber Monday a "legitimate trend," was initially cynical .
"Because the world needs another Officially Named shopping day, the people who dreamed up Black Friday (the day after Thanksgiving, when retailers hope to turn a profit) have created a nickname for the following Monday," the paper  wrote at the time . "Hence the catchy Cyber Monday, so called because millions of productive Americans, fresh off a weekend at the mall, are expected to return to work and their high-speed Internet connections on Nov. 28 and spend the day buying what they liked in all those stores."
The snark wouldn't last. In 2010, Cyber Monday became the biggest online shopping day of the year . The gimmick was worth $1.5 billion in 2012 — a newly minted American tradition anyone able to get online at work could honor.
Meanwhile, the NRF — the world's largest retail trade organization founded in 1911 — lined up on the conservative side of quite a few political issues. As seen on its Web site :
On Obamacare : "While some elements supported by NRF can be seen in the Affordable Care Act, NRF opposed passage because of the law’s failure to adequately address health care costs and its job-killing employer mandate. NRF has worked to repeal the most onerous provisions of the health care law, such as the employer mandate, but those efforts have not yet succeeded."
On unions : "NRF is working in court and Congress to overturn a recent series of highly politicized NLRB decisions that would make it easier to unionize retail stores."
On renewable fuel : "The Renewable Fuel Standard is a federal program that requires energy companies to blend billions of gallons of biofuels into the nation’s gasoline supply each year. ... [NRF affiliate National Council of Chain Restaurants] has led the chain restaurant industry’s efforts to have the Renewable Fuel Standard either repealed or rolled back, arguing that corn and soybeans should be used for food rather than fuel."
The NRF is not right-leaning on all issues. The trade association supports immigration reform and credit card swipe-fee reform that could benefit small businesses as much as major corporations. And it's facing new pressure from within to moderate its stance on other issues, like opposing an increase in the federal minimum wage.
But the trade association — which spent more than $3.5 million on lobbying in 2012 — often can be found more often on the red side of the aisle.
While supporting some Democratic politicians such as Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Chuck Rangel (D-N.Y.), RetailPAC , the NRF's political action committee, has donated to some of Congress's most visible conservatives . These include: House speaker John Boehner (Ohio), Rep. Eric Cantor (Va.), Sen. Lamar Alexander (Tenn.), Jim DeMint (S.C.) and Marco Rubio (Fla.).
And then there's Wal-Mart. Not long before the company became the target of labor advocates around the world , the NRF celebrated its relationship with the Walton family.
“Wal-Mart has joined the National Retail Federation,” Stephen Schatz, a NRF spokesman, said last year . “We are pleased to have them as a partner with the over 10,000 other NRF members who are advocating on behalf of an industry sector that creates good jobs, gives back to the communities they serve, leads in digital innovation and drives our national economy.”
Today, the anti-Black Friday campaign will continue with  #BoycottCyberMonday ." As Reverend Samuel Mosteller of Atlanta told News 95.5 : “The only time you white folks pay any attention to us is if we burn something down – or stop spending money.”
Interest in Cyber Monday, the biggest online shopping day of the year in the U.S, is growing globally as savvy online shoppers overseas click into the deals. (Reuters)

Why do black and Latino Americans support climate action so much more than whitesBy Chris Mooney and Peyton Craighill December 1 Follow chriscmooney
Hundreds of participants attend a candlelight vigil, a day before the inauguration of Climate Change Conference in Lima, Peru, Sunday, June 30, 2014. Negotiators from more than 190 countries will meet in Lima for two weeks to work on drafts for a global climate deal that is supposed to be adopted next year in Paris. (AP Photo/Martin Mejia)
This Monday in Lima, Peru, the next stage of international climate negotiations opens, buoyed by recent pledges by the U.S. and China to cap their emissions. The setting certainly doesn't hurt matters -- unlike  English speaking countries  such as the U.S., Canada, and Australia, the countries of South and Central America have not traditionally nourished  much homegrown global warming skepticism.
"I think there’s a good case to be made that what’s happening in Latin America is out in front of any other region of the world," says Lou Leonard, vice president for climate change at the World Wildlife Fund. As examples, Leonard cites Chile's recent passage of a carbon tax , Costa Rica's plans to become carbon neutral , and Mexico's ambitious climate law .
But it's not just Latin America -- Hispanics and Latinos in the U.S. also stand out as among the more green of demographic groups on questions of climate change. Such is the upshot of data from a  June Washington Post-ABC News poll , which we re-examined on the eve of the Lima meeting.
In the poll, both Hispanics/Latino Americans and Africans Americans were more likely than U.S. whites to say climate change is a very serious problem confronting the country:
Furthermore, Hispanics/Latino Americans were slightly more willing than whites and African Americans to say that the federal government should limit the release of greenhouse gases in an effort to reduce global warming:
(Note that results for the chart above combine two similar questions asked of half samples of poll respondents. One half was asked about regulating “existing power plants.” The other half was asked about states limiting gases within their borders. Each question produced nearly identical results.)
Finally, Hispanics/Latino Americans are far more willing than African Americans -- and a little more so than whites -- to allow the government to regulate greenhouse gases, even if that meant an increase in utility bills of $20 per month.
Two other polls conducted at nearly the same time, from NBC/Wall Street Journal and Quinnipiac University , asked similar questions about regulating greenhouse gases. These polls showed no differences between Hispanic/Latino Americans and African Americans, each of which were more willing to regulate than whites. A recent survey by the Public Religion Research Institute also found greater climate concern among Latino Americans.
So overall, what can we make of these data?
First, they are very consistent with a much discussed topic in the social science literature called the  "white male" effect , in which white males have been found to be generally less concerned about a number of environmental and other types of risks. In particular, in the U.S., conservative white males have been shown to be more dismissive of climate change risks, which one group of researchers suggested might be due to the fact that they have "disproportionately occupied positions of power within our economic system."
Second, when it comes to Hispanic/Latino Americans in particular, there has been interesting research on their reasons for climate concern. One common theme is that greater awareness of "transnational ties" may be an important factor -- in other words, awareness of how people think and how they grapple with environmental issues in other parts of the world. And indeed, in major South American countries like Brazil and Argentina , there is strong acceptance of the idea that global warming is caused by humans.
So as the Lima meeting commences, it's significant to find that the largest U.S. ethnic group -- Hispanic/Latino Americans, who comprise 15 percent of the population -- are so strongly in favor of climate change action. This is, clearly, a constituency that U.S. climate campaigners very much need to mobilize, and the Lima talks will surely be a key moment to do so.

Delhi: St Sebastians Church gutted by fire  Christian community suspect foulplayWritten by Sarah Hafeez | New Delhi |
Posted: December 1, 2014 9:22 pm | Updated: December 2, 2014 1:43 pm
It’s East Delhi again. There is a minority place of worship in question. And again there are allegations of mischief.
A fire broke out in a church in Northeast Delhi’s Dilshad Garden on Monday morning. Police have registered a case under IPC Section 436 (arson) following allegations by parish members that the fire was not accidental.
VIDEO: 
“A case has been registered. A forensic team went to St Sebastian Catholic Church in Dilshad Garden and collected two samples. The fire department is also preparing a report. Only after receiving these reports that we will able to ascertain the exact cause of the fire,” a police officer said.

Fire control room said they received a call around 7.26 am on Monday that a fire had broken out at the church. Four fire tenders were rushed to the spot and took around two hours to douse the flames. No casualties were reported as no one was present in the church except for the guard who spotted the fire and informed police.
Police said besides arson, they are looking at the possibility of a short circuit. The church was built in 2001.
Delhi Archbishop Anil Couto has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, calling on him to order a judicial enquiry into the fire. Couto said members of the Christian community will protest at the Delhi Police commissioner’s office on Tuesday morning to highlight “attempts to polarise the people in Delhi state” ahead of Assembly elections”.

He said the “arson” was an act of “sacrilege and hate” against the community and its faith and it was surprising that such an act could take place in Delhi, which is just recovering from a series of communal incidents”.
Father Mathew Koyickal, chancellor (Archdiocese of Delhi) alleged that “someone deliberately set fire to the church as there is a strong smell of kerosene in the air”. The first floor was gutted, and the holy books and the alter were reduced to ash.
He said residents who had gathered outside the church became restive when they saw no police officers present at the site.

LOS ANGELES — Henrik Fisker, the auto designer who headed a promising U.S. plug-in electric car venture before it went belly up, is back.
He's teaming with a Los Angeles performance house to produce a customized Ford Mustang muscle car.
The Galpin-Fisker Rocket is a Mustang that has been fired up to a supercharged 725 horsepower and had its body mostly covered in carbon fiber panels to reduce weight. To keep its giant engine cool, the front end has huge grille vents and scoops to channel air under the hood. The car comes with 21-inch wheels — a little HF for Henrik Fisker is on the hubs — and oversized Brembo brakes.
The car was designed by Fisker in conjunction with Galpin Auto Sports, the performance arm of Galpin Motors, which has a number of dealerships including the world's largest volume Ford dealer.
Fisker, who designed cars for BMW and Aston Martin before founding plug-in car maker Fisker Automotive, says he "always dreamed" about being involved with the Mustang.
"I admire the Mustang. It's a brand in itself," he told us at the Los Angeles Auto Show, where he unveiled the car last week. He says he tried to maintain the car's classic lines while adding touches like the gaping hexagonal carbon-fiber grille.
Fisker Automotive, based in California's Orange County, produced a single model, the Karma, a swoopy plug-in hybrid. The car was made by a contract builder in Finland, and the company had plans to produce a second model in the the USA, the Atlantic. But the Atlantic never got off the ground before Fisker Automotive stopped production.
Fisker says it shouldn't be a surprise that he'd be making the switch from plug-ins to muscle cars. "I love cars and I love all kinds of cars," he says. "I wouldn't imagine a world without cars."
Beau Boeckmann, president of Galpin Auto Sports, says Fisker approached him in August. He says he saw the rendering of the car "and I got chills" about the possibilities.
He says he sees the Mustang Rocket as a low-volume venture, maybe 100 to 150 cars a year and while no price has been set, it could run around $100,000. Boeckmann says there was never any doubt that the Rocket should be based off a Mustang.
As the ultimate American muscle car, "it's the perfect platform."

India looking to co-produce weapons with US | US delegation in Delhi to talk defenceDefence
(India has shortlisted five…)
WASHINGTON: India has shortlisted five of the 17 hi-tech items of military hardware offered by the US for co-production and co-development under a one-of-its kind American offer to boost bilateral defence cooperation.
These items are believed to be - naval guns, mine scattering anti-tank vehicles, unmanned aerial surveillance system, Javelin missiles, and aircraft landing system for carriers, informed defence sources familiar with the development between the two countries, told.
The five are "currently being looked at more seriously" by India's DRDO and Defence Ministry.
It was more than a year ago that the US in consultation with its private sector had offered India a list of 17 hi-tech defence items for co-production and co-development.
The one-of-its kind offer was made under the Defence Trade and Technology Initiative (DTTI) launched under the previous UPA government.
The list of 17 American defence items, which remains classified and has not been made public, was reviewed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and the Ministry of Defence.
According to informed sources, these five projects are now being reviewed by the Indian army, navy and air force, following which the Indian government would convey its decision to the Pentagon about the projects that it is interested in for co-production and co-development.
Despite India opting for the Israeli "Spike" anti-tank guided missile (ATGM), the US-made Javelin has not been ruled out, sources said.
The US has offered to co-produce the third-generation Javelin ATGMs, and co-develop its fourth-generation version.
  It is believed that India had pre-informed the US about its decision to opt for the Israeli missile to meet its immediate and short-term needs.
"We respect the Indian decision making process on this. It is a sovereign decision that India has to make. Obviously we think that American products and American systems have a lot to offer. We would have liked to win that (Javelin) competition.
"But there is a huge amount of possibility, and a number of spheres we want to talk to India about," US Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs, Puneet Talwar said on the eve of his visit to New Delhi.

Airlines' fuel savings unlikely to benefit fliers

Airline stocks are soaring as jet fuel prices plummet, but don't expect those savings to be passed on to fliers in the form of lower fares.
Investors are betting on fatter airline profits as a result of OPEC's decision to keep its production levels steady in the face of a world oil surplus. That's expected to push the price of jet fuel and other petroleum products even lower in the weeks ahead.
"OPEC just played Santa Claus to the world's airlines,'' says Henry Harteveldt, travel industry analyst with Atmosphere Research Group.
American Airlines said recently it expects to pay $2.56 to $2.61 a gallon for its mainline jet fuel this quarter compared with $3.10 in the first quarter. Its potential savings is at least $422 million.
The current dip in the cost of fuel might not have an immediate impact on every airline's bottom line. Some carriers hedge against surprise hikes in fuel costs by   buying it in advance at a set price. That's helpful if prices later soar, but not so much when prices dip.
Fuel tends to be an airline's single biggest expense, and when it becomes more expensive, it is often the main reason carriers give for hiking fares.
But with the traveling public currently itching to fly, and keeping many planes filled, carriers have little incentive to pass along any fuel savings to consumers in the form of cheaper tickets, industry watchers say.
"I don't expect airlines to squander these cuts on large-scale fare cuts,'' says Harteveldt. "The financial pain of the 2008-2009 economic crisis remains fresh in many airline executives' minds. As a result, I believe much of the savings from lower jet fuel prices will flow directly to airlines' bottom lines.''
Airlines, which have seen sometimes record-breaking profits in recent quarters, saw their share prices rocket Friday, a day after OPEC's meeting.
United (UAL) finished up 8.18% to $61.23 in trading Friday. American Airlines (AAL) was up 7.92% to $48.53. Delta (DAL) was up 5.49% to $46.67, while JetBlue (JBLU) was up 7.57% to $14.63 a share.
Rick Seaney, of FareCompare.com, agreed that consumers shouldn't expect fares to drop, at least not in the near future. "I would expect some international fuel surcharges to come down before any domestic price drops,'' he says.
Harteveldt says that any fare cuts would cover tickets that offer travelers the least flexibility if their plans change and that they will probably be short-term deals for vacations booked well in advance.

Rahul Gandhi s campaign made victory easy for BJP: Amit ShahPress Trust of India | Dec 01, 2014 at 10:46pm IST
Bokaro (Jharkhand): Criticising Congress and JMM for the prevailing state of affairs in Jharkhand, BJP President Amit Shah said Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has made BJP's victory easy wherever he went for campaigning.
"It had become easy for BJP to win the seats wherever Rahul had campaigned in the last parliamentary polls. This is also happening in the Assembly elections in Jharkhand," Shah said while addressing an election rally in favour of party candidate Madhav Lal Singh, a sitting MLA at Gomia in Bokaro district on Monday.
Congress was concerned about the sea of humanity turning up at all rallies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he claimed.
Congress was concerned about the sea of humanity turning up at all rallies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Shah claimed.
"You have ousted the mother-son government at the Centre and now it is the turn of Jharkhand to dismiss the father-son duo and install a full-majority government of BJP," Shah said referring to the Sibu Soren-Hemant Soren regime.
While Congress had committed the coal scam, the Soren-government was indulged in the sand scam, he alleged, assuring the people that BJP would expose them and "punish the culprits".
Congress has been asking for a six-month account of the Narendra Modi government, but they should first give the country an account of their sixty-year rule, Shah said.

Agartala: In a rare meeting between the political right and the left, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday interacted with Tripura's Marxist cabinet at the latter's invitation and hailed the state's successful strategy in curbing the three-decade-old insurgency.
An impressed Modi asked the state government to submit a detailed report on the strategy adopted by the Left Front government in the next meeting of the Planning Commission on December 7.
The Prime Minister, during his interaction wanted to know two success stories of the Marxists from Chief Minister Manik Sarkar who cited the tackling of the three-decade-old insurgency in the state as their main success.
An impressed Modi asked the state government to submit a detailed report on the strategy adopted by the Left Front government.
#narendra modi #tripura #manik sarkar
Addressing the media, Sarkar said he had told the PM that "we gave absolute freedom to security forces to act and we drew support of the masses, both tribal and non-tribal groups. The government also ran a political and ideological campaign to win over the disgruntled elements."
On the PM's query about the whereabouts of the surrendered insurgent and how they were contributing to society, Sarkar said "we informed him that all returnees had started normal life by starting private business or helping the government in other sectors after receiving post-surrender vocational training and cash dole as a part of the surrender package."
The state government also submitted a memorandum containing nine demands to the Prime Minister before he left for New Delhi after a three-day visit to the Northeast.
The demands included PM's intervention for setting up a gas-based Urea fertilizer plant, an Indian Institute of Technology, Indian Institute of Management and a Central Agricultural University to benefit students of the NE region and adjoining countries like Bangladesh and Myanmar.
On developing bilateral relations with Bangladesh, the state government requested the PM to persuade Bangladesh government to allow multi-modal transportation of goods through Bangladesh with the Ashuganj port of call and Chittagong port.
Asked if the state government was satisfied with the Prime Minister's assurances during his visit to Tripura, Sarkar said "a Prime Minister has assured us development and consolidated approach towards utilization of resources and employment generation. I don't see any question of dissatisfaction."

Tony Kornheiser says advanced metrics could save the RedskinsBy Dan Steinberg December 1 Follow @dcsportsbog
(By Darron Cummings / AP)
As a state of lassitude again descends upon the people who follow the Redskins — and also upon those who talk about the Redskins for a living — one giant question looms: what’s next?
Previous answers have included the hot college coach (Steve Spurrier), the experienced NFL hand (Mike Shanahan, Marty Schottenheimer), the up-and-coming coordinator (Jay Gruden) and the random dude with funny stories (Jim Zorn). They have included nods to the franchise’s past (Joe Gibbs, Bruce Allen) and guillotines for the franchise’s present (Vinny Cerrato). They have included drafting a franchise quarterback (RGIII, Patrick Ramsey, Jason Campbell), trading for a franchise quarterback (Donovan McNabb) and attempting to conjure a franchise quarterback out of Lincoln Logs and inspirational quote books (John Beck). They have tried to build around an exciting new wide receiver (DeSean Jackson), an exciting new running back (Clinton Portis), an exciting new left tackle (Trent Williams, Chris Samuels), an exciting new linebacker (Brian Orakpo, LaVar Arrington), an exciting new safety (too many to count), an exciting group of players lured en masse from elsewhere (the Jetskins!) and an exciting new defensive lineman who enjoys long naps (Albert Haynesworth).
Through it all has run a river of mediocrity.
And so here’s Tony Kornheiser to suggest one of the few things the Redskins haven’t tried (other than hiring the best scouts, stockpiling draft picks, building around the offensive and defensive lines, and acquiring a premier general manager): embracing Moneyball!
“The problem with the team, to me — lots of problems with the team — but you’ve now gone through a series of coaches here,” Kornheiser said on ESPN 980 Monday morning. “And no appreciable bounce since Joe Gibbs, who you’re not gonna get for a third time. No appreciable bounce. You had Spurrier, you had Zorn, you had Shanahan, now you have Jay Gruden, whose lifetime career as a head coach is 3-9.
“And if he were to be released at the end of the year, that’s probably defensible,” Kornheiser said. “I don’t think that’s going to happen. I don’t recommend it. But it’s probably defensible, if an owner says you know what, I can’t live with this. Coach after coach after coach I hire, for whatever reason I hire them, and they don’t work out. I think they’re gonna work out; they don’t work out.
“The players are terrible. The people picking the players have picked the wrong players, time and time and time again, for whatever reason. And…I would follow the pattern that was started by Billy Beane in Major League Baseball. I would look at the kind of mathematical equation that was never before used in baseball and now is all the rage in baseball. And I’m not saying you don’t look at players physically, but you use analytics, you use metrics, whatever these words are. You try a new system to acquire players and to acquire coaches who will buy into that system.
“Remember in Moneyball, the conflict between Art Howe and Billy Beane, which led to Art Howe having to leave at some point,” Kornheiser went on. “You see this taking over in baseball. I’m not saying it’s all for the good, but you also see it in basketball, where it was hard for me to even imagine that shots from a certain spot on the court would be rewarded mathematically….
“I understand it appears to be much harder in football, because we’ve never heard of it before,” Kornheiser said. “I’d find that kid at Yale, or Harvard, or Maryland, or Virginia, or University of San Diego — the kid who has devoted his life, maybe he’s 24, 25 right now — not a fantasy football geek, but somebody who’s devoted his life to the study of the game through analytics and metrics, through mathematical combinations that have not been seen  before. I’d hire that guy. I’d say we can’t get much worse, is what I would say. We can’t get much worse.
“I’m saying that there’s somebody out there who has taken all of this stuff into account and has a formula….I’ll bet you there’s somebody out there that could convince you on 50 percent of an evaluation that this is what you look for, this type of player, and that the given is heart, that they have heart and they want the conflict. The Redskins could be the first team to do anything like this, because how much worse could it get?
“Who is hiring the defensive backs? Who’s hiring them? Who’s hiring them? They’re awful. There were three drives — drives, I can’t even use the word drive — three play, two play, three play. What is that? They are terrible. I mean any discussion about quarterback, it’s pointless. It’s pointless if that is the defense. It is simply pointless. You see the backs of their jerseys 15 yards behind some guy who’s running to the end zone. Awful. As a defensive secondary, they are awful.”
I mean, this is true. It’s also true the Redskins have tried many things, but have yet to try Moneyball. And yet this sounds kind of like your friend who has tried the South Beach Diet, the Cauliflower and Kale Diet, the Atkins Diet, the Green Juice Diet, the Three-Fingered Wizard Meatball Diet, and the Alien Adventure Diet, and who has now decided to embark on the Red Rover Red Rover Metric Analytic Diet, but who will not try the Eat Less and Exercise Diet.
Eat Less and Exercise, in this case, meaning hiring the best scouts, stockpiling draft picks, building around the offensive and defensive lines, and acquiring a premier general manager.
Anyhow, Kornheiser ended the segment by predicting that the Redskins would find a way to draft Jameis Winston.

AP promises huge incentives to auto sectorAP promises huge incentives to auto sector
BS Reporter | Hyderabad Dec 01, 2014 08:38 PM IST
The Andhra Pradesh government on Monday unveiled a new automobile policy by offering huge tax incentives and other facilities for mega integrated automobile projects with investments of over Rs 2,000 crore of which Rs 500 crore should come by way of an ancillary base.
"It is observed that in Andhra Pradesh there are hardly any automobile companies. To attract auto majors like Honda, Hyundai and Maruti to set up their second plants in AP, a pro-active policy is needed to be formulated," the government said in its orders pertaining to the incentives and the eligibility criteria for the investments in the automobile sector. The government stated it aims to develop an automobile hub in the Nellore-Chittoor region, which is close to Chennai and Bengaluru.
Auto companies will get a gross VAT reimbursement on sale of finished goods for a period of 20 years or 150 per cent of the capital expenditure spent in the first seven years, whichever is earlier.
The other tax incentives include reimbursement of VAT on input credit for 20 years, concession in VAT rates on inputs and raw materials and capital goods at 5 per cent for 20 years, 100 per cent CST reimbursement for 10 years and no entry tax or octroi to be levied on items procured by the investors. Besides, the companies will get a reimbursement of Rs 0.75 per unit on power costs for five years besides reimbursement of stamp duty and transfer duty on land.
The government has also offered 24-hour uninterrupted power supply, 4-lane roads connecting the plant to the nearest national highway, and single window clearances within a specified period of 60 days among other things.
"The mega integrated automobile project will mean automobile projects that will have engine plant, press shop, body shop, transmission line, assembly line, paint shop etc either on its own or in consortium or joint venture in the same location with investments over and above Rs 1,500 crore and which will bring ancillary units of a minium of Rs 500 crore within three years would be eligible," it said.
The AP government had achieved the first break in attracting a major automobile investment in September when bike manufacturer Hero Motocorp signed an MoU to set up its plant near Tada in the Nellore-Chittoor region. A similar set of incentives was offered to the company at that time.

Five farmers took their lives in Maharashtra in the three days to Monday.
The wave of farmer suicides in the rain-shadow regions of Marathwada and Vidarbha continues unabated despite the new Bharatiya Janata Party government announcing relief measures to combat the agricultural crisis affecting more than 19,000 villages in the State.
Three consecutive years of drought and unseasonable rain have broken the spirit of farmers.
Reports say changing weather patterns, mounting indebtedness and poor crop yield are driving farmers to suicide.
Tulsidas Madalwad, a minor farmer, electrocuted himself at Kakandi village in Nanded district unable to pay off the debts accumulated over multiple bad harvests on his two-acre farm. “He returned from his field and electrocuted himself by stringing wires to his feet around 10 a.m. When his wife and little daughter came with food, they found him charred to death,” a villager said.
Madalwad was devastated by the destruction of his soya bean crop and was worried about repaying more than Rs. 1 lakh to banks and local moneylenders, the people said.
In the neighbouring Latur district, Sangram Bemde, 46, another marginal farmer, immolated himself on Monday after his cotton crop failed for the third consecutive year, traumatising his family and relatives.
Kashiram Indore, 76, built a pyre and jumped into it on Friday following the poor soya bean yield from his one-acre farm at Manarkhed in Akola. Indore was despondent as just a quintal and a half of soya bean could be harvested this year.
The Javadekar family of Javda in Buldhana is facing the grimmest winter after their only son, Shivshankar, 24, hanged himself on Saturday evening as he could not repay the Rs. 60,000 loan his family took after their two-acre farm faced consecutive years of drought.
Family members said Shivshankar was aspiring to pursue higher education. Another farmer too committed suicide in the district.

IRB crashed so much , my average price was less than 80 then but i sold it at a few rupees higher cause I thought it would fall again . IRB almost hit 300 . So we should trust own conviction more , market always gets it wrong  .
I bought JKlakmsi around 80 rupees last year , averaged it  as it fell, It fell to 45 rupees . Almost 50% fall from there yet i kept on buying n m avg was less than 60 rupees .

Ok, now i get it , I think it`s adjustment only. Greenlam is not a subsidiary any more and Shareholders are actually losing nothing , In other words . The share was commanding a premium .
So people who held the stock @ 27 will get the shares of the new company .
This will play out similar to Gulf oil , Enjoy the ride the both stocks later .
Also don`t call the company cheat . There`s nothing cheat in it . It`s discounting the price of Greenlam in the price .
